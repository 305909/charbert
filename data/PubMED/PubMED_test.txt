Induction of a massive endoplasmic reticulum and perinuclear space expansion by expression of lamin B receptor mutants and the related sterol reductases TM7SF2 and DHCR7. Lamin B receptor (LBR) is an inner nuclear membrane protein involved in tethering the nuclear lamina and the underlying chromatin to the nuclear envelope. In addition, LBR exhibits sterol reductase activity. Mutations in the LBR gene cause two different human diseases: Pelger-HuÃ«t anomaly and Greenberg skeletal dysplasia, a severe chrondrodystrophy causing embryonic death. Our study aimed at investigating the effect of five LBR disease mutants on human cultured cells. Three of the tested LBR mutants caused a massive compaction of chromatin coincidental with the formation of a large nucleus-associated vacuole (NAV) in several human cultured cell lines. Live cell imaging and electron microscopy revealed that this structure was generated by the separation of the inner and outer nuclear membrane. During NAV formation, nuclear pore complexes and components of the linker of nucleoskeleton and cytoskeleton complex were lost in areas of membrane separation. Concomitantly, a large number of smaller vacuoles formed throughout the cytoplasm. Notably, forced expression of the two structurally related sterol reductases transmembrane 7 superfamily member 2 and 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase caused, even in their wild-type form, a comparable phenotype in susceptible cell lines. Hence, LBR mutant variants and sterol reductases can severely interfere with the regular organization of the nuclear envelope and the endoplasmic reticulum.

[Ultrasonographic characterization of an experimental model of liver metastases from colon carcinoma in rats]. To determine the ultrasonographic characteristics of liver metastases induced in a rat model; to evaluate the usefulness of ultrasonography in the noninvasive evaluation of tumor infiltration. We seeded the livers of 46 WAG/RijCrl rats with CC-531 syngeneic colorectal carcinoma cells by intrasplenic inoculation. At 21, 28, 35, 42, 70 days after tumor seeding, we performed a series of ultrasonographic examinations to evaluate tumor induction in different groups of animals: 37 rats were studied with a 10 MHz linear probe and 9 were studied with a 6-18 MHz multifrequency probe. The following signs were considered indicative of tumor development: intrahepatic nodules, sinuate liver borders, lobe enlargement, and extrahepatic masses. Ultrasonographic findings were verified at autopsy. We determined the number of implants, size (less than 3mm, between 3 and 7 mm, or greater than 7 mm), and lobe location for each technique. Compared to the autopsy results, ultrasonography detected 64% of the animals with disease. All the extrahepatic masses were correctly diagnosed. Metastases were identified in 90% of the rats with lesions greater than 7 mm, in 75% of those with implants between 3 and 7 mm, and in 25% of those with lesions less than 3mm. In the group in which we used the 6-18 MHz probe, we detected 50% of the lesions less than 3mm. Ultrasonography was useful for monitoring the experimental model and enabled the noninvasive oncologic evaluation of the rat liver with reasonable sensitivity.

Transgenic zebrafish eggs containing bactericidal peptide is a novel food supplement enhancing resistance to pathogenic infection of fish. Zebrafish (Danio rerio) was used as a bioreactor to produce bovine lactoferricin (LFB), which has wide-ranging antimicrobial activity. We constructed an expression plasmid in which LFB was fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) and driven by zebrafish beta-actin promoter. After microinjection, six transgenic founders were screened on the basis of GFP appearance. Among them, a stable ZBL-5 line was selected by the ubiquitous and strong expression of GFP. Using PCR and Western blot analysis, we confirmed that the recombinant LFB-GFP protein was produced by the F2 progeny derived from the ZBL-5 line. The bactericidal agar plate assay proved that the functional domain of LFB was released from the LFB-GFP fusion protein, resulting in strong bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli, Edwardsiella tarda and Aeromonas hydrophila. Furthermore, adult zebrafish were given one feeding of fifty 72-hpf transgenic embryos. The treated fish were then immersed in freshwater containing 1 x 10(5) CFU ml(-1)E. tarda for 7 days. The survival rate of the treated zebrafish was significantly higher than that of fish fed with fifty wild-type embryos (75 +/- 12.5% versus 4 +/- 7.2%). This line of evidence suggested that pathogen resistance can be enhanced by using transgenic embryos containing LFB-GFP as a food supplement for fish, while, at the same time, reducing the demand of chemical antibiotics.

Generation of fad2 transgenic mice that produce omega-6 fatty acids. Fatty acid desaturase-2 (FAD2) introduces a double bond in position Delta12 in oleic acid (18:1) to form linoleic acid (18:2 n-6) in higher plants and microbes. A new transgenic expression cassette, containing CMV promoter/fad2 cDNA/SV40 polyA, was constructed to produce transgenic mice. Among 63 healthy offspring, 10 founders (15.9%) integrated the cotton fad2 transgene into their genomes, as demonstrated by PCR and Southern blotting analysis. All founder mice were fertile and heterozygous fad2 female and nontransgenic littermates were used for fatty acid analysis using gas chromatography. One fad2 transgenic line showed substantial differences in the fatty acid profiles and the level of linoleic acid was increased 19% (P<0.05) in transgenic muscles compared to their nontransgenic littermates. Moreover, it exhibited an 87% and a 9% increase (P<0.05) in arachidonic acid (20:4 n-6) in muscles and liver, compared to their nontransgenic littermates. The results indicate that the plant fad2 gene can be functionally expressed in transgenic mice and may playan active role in conversion of oleic acid into linoleic acid.

Three-dimensional echocardiographic assessment of right ventricular volume and function in adult patients with congenital heart disease: comparison with magnetic resonance imaging.

A study of perioperative hyperglycemia in patients with diabetes having colon, spine, and joint surgery. Patients with diabetes often have impaired wound healing and an increased rate of postoperative complications with surgery. Most research has focused on the effect of hyperglycemia in the postoperative period, but there is limited evidence to guide blood glucose (bG) control throughout the perioperative period. This retrospective study explored the effect of hyperglycemia in the PACU on postoperative complications, length of stay (LOS), and in-hospital mortality in patients with diabetes undergoing spine, colon, or joint surgery. Findings revealed that the total LOS for patients with a PACU bG >200 mg/dL was significantly longer than for patients with a maximum bG of 140 to 200 mg/dL. Further, the rate of total complications increased significantly as bG levels increased. More prospective, controlled studies on the management of perioperative hyperglycemia are recommended for consideration.

Motor and sensitive axonal regrowth after multiple intercosto-lumbar neurotizations in a sheep model. Experimental animal study. To evaluate motor and sensitive axonal regrowth after multiple intercosto-lumbar neurotizations in a sheep model. France. Fifteen sheep were separated into three groups. Five sheep had multiple intercosto-lumbar neurotizations and a spinal cord lesion, five sheep were neurotized without any spinal cord lesion and five sheep had a spinal cord lesion without any neurotizations. Six months after the initial surgery, histological study of the neurotized roots was performed. The length of the three rerouted intercostal nerves was sufficient in the 10 sheep to perform an intercosto-lumbar neurotization in good conditions. Eight sheep out of the 15 had postoperative complications responsible for the animal's death in five cases. Histological cross-sections of all the neurotized L2, L3 and L4 roots showed numerous myelinated regenerated axons. Dorsal root ganglions of neurotized roots showed both large and small neurons with normal nucleus and cytoplasm. The fluorescent retrograde labeling of 18 roots revealed labeled motor neurons in five cases. This study demonstrates the technical feasibility of intercosto-lumbar neurotizations in a big mammalian model. Intercostal nerve harvesting and rerouting was successfully performed in all the cases. Our histological results proved, in all the animals studied, the ability of motor and sensitive neurons to regenerate through the neurotization area. In the context of the future clinical application of strategies aimed at promoting axonal regeneration after severe spinal cord injury, the present data suggest that multiple intercosto-lumbar neurotization could be helpful to promote lower limb muscular strength recovery after spinal cord injuries.

Detection of tissue folds in whole slide images. In whole slide imaging (WSI) the quality of scanned images is an interplay between the hardware specifications of the scanning device and the condition of the tissue slide itself. Tissue artifacts such as folds and bubbles have been known to affect the efficiency of a whole slide scanning system in selecting the focus points wherein the presence of the said artifacts have been found to produce blur or unfocused images. Thus, for a whole slide scanning device to produce the best image quality, even with the presence of tissue artifacts, information on the location of these artifacts should be known such that they can be avoided in the selection of the focus points. In this paper we introduced an enhancement method to emphasize and detect the location of the tissue folds from whole slide images. Results of the experiments that we conducted on various H&E stained images that were scanned using different scanners show the robustness of the method to detect tissue folds.

Gastroprotective activity of Trichosanthes cucumerina in rats. The aim of the present study was to scientifically investigate whether Trichosanthes cucumerina Linn (Family: Cucurbitaceae) has gastroprotective activity. All the experiments were conducted using Wistar strain rats (weight: 200-220 g). The food and water given to rats was withdrawn for 36 and 12h respectively, before the commencement of the experiment. These rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (n=8 rats/group; 4 males+4 females) and groups 1-3 were orally administrated with hot water extract (HWE) at a dose of 375, 500 and 750 mg/kg, respectively. Group 4 was orally treated with equal volume of distilled water (1 mL; control), group 5 was orally treated with a reference drug, cimetidine (100mg/kg) while the group 6 was orally treated with another reference drug, sucralfate (400mg/kg). In the indomethacin experiment, only one dose of HWE (750 mg/kg) was tested, as this was found to have the maximum effect in the alcohol model also. Results show that the HWE of Trichosanthes cucumerina possesses significant (P<or=0.05) and dose dependent gastroprotective effects in the alcohol model in terms of the length and number of gastric lesions mediated by alcohol, with a maximum effect at 750 mg/kg (inhibition of lesion length by 92%; number of gastric lesions by 88%). The same dose also mediated a significant (P<or=0.05) gastroprotective activity in the indomethacine model (inhibition of lesion length by 88%; number of gastric lesions by 84%). In both models, the protective effect demonstrated by the HWE was comparable with that produced by cimetidine. The HWE significantly (P<or=0.05) increased the amount of mucus produced by the rat gastro mucosa (by 39%) and reduced the gastric acidity (total acidity by 36%; free acidity by 40%). pH of the gastric juice increased from 4.1 to 6.0. However, no change in the volume of gastric juice was observed. Further, HWE showed potent antihistamine activity. It may be concluded that HWE of Trichosanthes cucumerina exerts a significant protection against ethanol or indomethacin induced gastric damage. Increasing the protective mucus layer, decreasing the acidity of the gastric juice and antihistamine activity are probable mechanisms by which the HWE of Trichosanthes cucumerina mediates its gastroprotective actions.


Non-fatal injuries in three Central and Eastern European urban population samples: the HAPIEE study.

Emotional violence among women in intimate relationships in Botswana. A Heideggerian hermeneutic phenomenological approach was used to investigate the lived experience of women in Botswana who had experienced emotional abuse in intimate relationships. Hermeneutic phenomenology is concerned with the human experience as it is lived. Ten educated Botswana women who had formal employment and have been in intimate relationships for longer than ten years, narrated their life experiences with abusive men. Extensive interviews took place over a six month period. Sociocultural practices in Botswana emerged as salient factors that contribute to emotional abuse and predispose women to mental illness. Entwined in these cultural practices are issues of age, ethnicity, payment of lobola (bride price), financial standing, change of name, and relocation to the man's residence. Education and employment seem to worsen the abuse. Depression and anxiety are common results of abuse. Understanding how the sociocultural factors perpetuate abuse can assist nurses in the way they provide health care services to women.

Real-time medical control using a wireless audio-video transmission device in a pre-hospital emergency service in Korea. We developed a hands-free portable device which can provide two-way, real-time audio and video communication between hospital doctors and emergency medical technicians (EMTs) providing pre-hospital care. The device was based on an ultra mobile PC with a camera, a microphone/earphone set and a WIBRO modem for wireless Internet connection at an average data transmission rate of 1 Mbit/s. Feasibility tests were conducted in 55 real emergency situations over a period of three months at five different Rescue Centres in Seoul. Successful communication between an EMT and a doctor was achieved in 46 cases (84%). The device showed acceptable performance in terms of audio/video transmission time delays and maximum transmitted video frame rates, both outdoors, inside a building and in a moving vehicle at 70 km/h. Eight control centre staff and 11 EMTs who used the device completed a questionnaire. Despite acceptable basic performance, the device was found to be limited in terms of the contribution it made to the medical control of EMTs. However, improvements in device performance should produce higher quality pre-hospital emergency medical care in the future.

Microglia and central nervous system immunity. The central nervous system (CNS) has evolved as an immune-privileged site to protect its vital functions from damaging immune-mediated inflammation. There must be a CNS-adapted system of surveillance that continuously evaluates local changes in the nervous system and communicates to the peripheral immune system during an injury or a disease. Recent advances leading to a better understanding of the CNS disease processes has placed microglia, the CNS-based resident macrophages, at center stage in this system of active surveillance. Evidence points to microglia cells contributing to the immunosuppressive environment of gliomas and actually promoting tumor growth. Microglia accumulation exists in almost every CNS disease process, including CNS tumors. This article discusses the role of microglia in CNS immunity and highlights key advances made in glioma immunology.

The relationship between binge eating and weight status on depression, anxiety, and body image among a diverse college sample: a focus on Bi/Multiracial women. Binge eating is associated with a host of adverse outcomes, but little is known about sex and racial differences among those who binge eat. The present study examined sex and racial group differences in binge eating based on weight status within a college-student population. It was hypothesized that White women would endorse higher rates of binge eating, depression, anxiety, and body image dissatisfaction than other groups. Participants completed a web-based survey assessing depression, anxiety, body image, weight history, physical activity, smoking, and body mass index. Participants included White, Black, and Bi/Multiracial college students. Findings highlighted sex and racial differences based on binge eating and weight status. Notably, Bi/Multiracial women who endorsed binge eating behavior and who were overweight reported greater levels of anxiety than all other groups and greater levels of depression than White women and White men. Additionally, Bi/Multiracial women and White women who endorsed binge eating behavior and who were overweight reported greater body image dissatisfaction relative to Black women and White men. Future research should further explore the nature and impact of sex and race differences on binge eating.


The effects of non-linearities on shear stress in periodic flow in axi-symmetric vessels.

Flare-up of hand osteoarthritis caused by zoledronic acid infusion. Zoledronic acid is effective for osteoporosis at a single annual intravenous dose. It usually causes few adverse effects; the most common are related to acute phase reactions. We reported the case of a 64-year-old woman who presented flare-up of hand osteoarthritis after zoledronic acid infusions. Despite the fact that arthralgia is a common side effect of intravenous bisphosphonates, development of inflammatory signs in osteoarthritic joints is a rare event. We hypothesized that this side effect is caused by a release of cytokines secondary to activation of gamma-delta T lymphocytes.


Putative chemopreventive molecules can increase Nrf2-regulated cell defense in some human cancer cell lines, resulting in resistance to common cytotoxic therapies.

[Role of indoor endotoxins in asthma symptoms]. Endotoxin is a collective term designating a characteristic group of chemical constituents of the outer membrane of Gram negative bacteria, the lipopolysaccharides (LPS). LPS provocation tests in healthy subjects (50 microg) induce asthma-like airflow obstruction with a neutrophilic inflammatory influx, similar to reactions observed in non-atopic asthma. Asthmatic subjects show the same reaction with smaller doses of LPS (20 microg), revealing higher sensitivity to LPS than normal subjects. Low levels (2 microg) of LPS do not induce either airflow obstruction or bronchial hyperreactivity. Among exposed workers, particularly in agriculture, endotoxin is the most significant component of the bioaerosol that is associated with airway disease. In clinical studies, exposure to LPS is associated with severe asthma. Conversely, epidemiological studies, in both urban and rural areas, assessing the relationship between exposure to LPS and asthma and asthma- related symptoms are inconsistent. Longitudinal epidemiological studies, especially in farm children, may confirm the putative protective effects of LPS with respect to atopic asthma. Exposure to indoor LPS is frequently associated with asthma and asthma-like symptoms in current studies. Their definitive role needs to be confirmed by birth cohort studies currently under way that should define the controversial protective effect of LPS with respect to atopic asthma in farming populations.


The extrinsic apoptosis pathway and its prognostic impact in ovarian cancer.

An Improved Method With High Specificity for KIR2DL1 Functional Allele Typing. As new killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) alleles are discovered, a challenge in KIR typing is maintaining sensitivity and specificity. A single nucleotide polymorphism assay can be used to type functional KIR2DL1 alleles. We improved recently on the earlier method by using a higher-specificity assay. The major modifications include the development of sequence-specific primers to selectively amplify the transmembrane domain of all known KIR2DL1 alleles via polymerase chain reaction with sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP), and using the PCR products as the template for a revised KIR2DL1 functional allele-typing assay. This modified method allows high-throughput typing with high specificity.

Pesticides in dust from homes in an agricultural area. We collected indoor dust samples from homes in the Salinas Valley of California. Of 22 pesticides measured in 504 samples, permethrins and the organophosphate chlorpyrifos were present in highest amounts. In multivariate Tobit regression models among samples from 197 separate residences, reported agricultural uses of chlorpyrifos, a herbicide (2,3,5,6-tetrachloroterephthalate (DCPA)), and a fungicide (iprodione) on agricultural fields were significantly (p < 0.01) associated, with 83%, 19%, and 49% increases, respectively, in dust concentrations for each kg applied per day, near participant homes, in the month or season prior to sample collection. However, agricultural use of diazinon, which was 2.2 times that of chlorpyrifos, and of permethrin were not significantly associated with dust levels. Other variables independently associated with dust levels included temperature and rainfall, farmworkers storing work shoes in the home, storing a diazinon product in the home, housing density, having a home less clean, and having an air conditioner. Permethrins, chlorpyrifos, DCPA, and iprodione have either a log octanol-water partition coefficient (K(ow)) greater than 4.0, a very low vapor pressure, or both. Health risk assessments for pesticides that have these properties may need to include evaluation of exposures to house dust.

Uncertainties in external dosimetry: analytical vs. Monte Carlo method. Over the years, the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) and other organisations have formulated recommendations regarding uncertainty in occupational dosimetry. The most practical and widely accepted recommendations are the trumpet curves. To check whether routine dosemeters comply with them, a Technical Report on uncertainties issued by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) can be used. In this report, the analytical method is applied to assess the uncertainty of a dosemeter fulfilling an IEC standard. On the other hand, the Monte Carlo method can be used to assess the uncertainty. In this work, a direct comparison of the analytical and the Monte Carlo methods is performed using the same input data. It turns out that the analytical method generally overestimates the uncertainty by about 10-30 %. Therefore, the results often do not comply with the recommendations of the ICRP regarding uncertainty. The results of the more realistic uncertainty evaluation using the Monte Carlo method usually comply with the recommendations of the ICRP. This is confirmed by results seen in regular tests in Germany.

Catechol estrogens mediated activation of Nrf2 through covalent modification of its quinone metabolite to Keap1. The catechol metabolites (2-OHE and 4-OHE) of estrogen enter a redox cycle, thereby generating not only reactive oxygen species (ROS) but also electrophilic quinones. It is well recognized that chemicals causing oxidative stress or electrophiles activate a transcription factor Nrf2 that is negatively regulated by Keap1, leading to up-regulation of downstream proteins responsible for detoxification of electrophiles in cells. The purpose of the present study is to explore the roles of oxidative and electrophilic stress in Nrf2 activation caused by redox-active catechol estrogens. Exposure of RAW264.7 cells to 2- and 4-OHE activated Nrf2, resulting in induction of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and glutamate cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC). Under these conditions, intracellular oxidants were generated; however, subsequent examinations revealed that quinoid metabolites derived from 2- and 4-OHE mainly participate in the Nrf2 activation. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) analysis revealed Keap1 undergoes modification by such quinoid species through multiple reactive thiol groups. These results suggest that Nrf2 activation during redox cycling of catechol estrogens is dominantly attributable to formation of their ortho-quinones that covalently bind to Keap1.


Dual-tract transhepatic U-shaped hemodialysis inferior vena cava catheter: a feasibility study in a swine model.

Arthroscopic removal of proximal humerus locking plates. A technique of removing proximal humerus locking plates using an arthroscopic technique is described. Though technically demanding, benefits include smaller incisions, decreased risk of infection, and the ability to visualize and protect the axillary nerve throughout the course of the procedure. Furthermore, arthroscopy affords the surgeon with the ability to address concomitant intraarticular pathology at the time of surgery.

Irpex lacteus, a white-rot fungus with biotechnological potential--review. White-rot fungi that are efficient lignin degraders responsible for its turnover in nature have appeared twice in the center of biotechnological research - first, when the lignin degradation process started being systematically investigated and major enzyme activities and mechanisms involved were described, and second, when the huge remediation potential of these organisms was established. Originally, Phanerochaete chrysosporium became a model organism, characterized by a secondary metabolism regulatory pattern triggered by nutrient (mostly nitrogen) limitation. Last decade brought evidence of more varied regulatory patterns in white-rot fungi when ligninolytic enzymes were also abundantly synthesized under conditions of nitrogen sufficiency. Gradually, research was focused on other species, among them Irpex lacteus showing a remarkable pollutant toxicity resistance and biodegradation efficiency. Systematic research has built up knowledge of biochemistry and biotechnological applicability of this fungus, stressing the need to critically summarize and estimate these scattered data. The review attempts to evaluate the information on I. lacteus focusing on various enzyme activities and bioremediation of organopollutants in water and soil environments, with the aim of mediating this knowledge to a broader microbiological audience.


Efficacy of clarithromycin against experimentally induced pneumonia caused by clarithromycin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae in mice.

Sea turtles compensate deflection of heading at the sea surface during directional travel. Air-breathing marine animals, including sea turtles, utilise two fundamentally different environments (i.e. sea surface and underwater) during migration. Many satellite telemetry studies have shown travel paths at relatively large spatio-temporal scales, discussing the orientation and navigation mechanisms that guide turtles. However, as travel paths obtained by satellite telemetry only reflect movements at the surface, little is known about movements and orientation ability underwater. In this study, to assess orientation ability both at the surface and underwater, fine-scale 3-D movements of free-ranging loggerhead turtles Caretta caretta were reconstructed by using multi-sensor data loggers. Video systems ('Crittercam') were also used to record the behaviour of the turtles and the visual information surrounding the turtles. During August and October in 2006 and 2007, eight turtles were released from Otsuchi Bay, Japan (39 degrees 20'30N, 141 degrees 56'00E), and a total of 118 h of 3-D movements were reconstructed. Turtles maintained highly straight-line courses (straightness index >0.95) during 41% of the total duration (i.e. 'travelling periods'). During travelling periods, turtles swam continuously, maintaining unidirectional heading throughout dives whereas turtles changed heading remarkably at the surface. Despite highly directional movements during dives, travel direction tended to shift by the end of dives lasting 10 minutes or more. Such deflections seemed to be compensated during subsequent surfacing periods because there was a negative relationship between changes in travel direction arising during dives and subsequent surfacing periods. Therefore, remarkable changes in heading at the surface could be interpreted as direction-searching behaviour. Our results suggested that turtles undertaking directional travel were more dependent on directional information that was reliable at the surface.

[Readmissions to hospital for asthma in France, 2002-2005]. Most hospital admissions with asthma are avoidable. The objective of the analysis was to describe hospital readmissions for asthma. Using data from the French hospital information system, admissions for asthma or for acute respiratory failure associated with asthma that occurred in 2-44 years-old patients between 2002 and 2005 in France (excluding French overseas departments) were analysed. Readmission rates at 7 days and at 1 year were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The risk of readmission at 1 year was 15.0%. It varied according to age (higher in 2-4 year and 35-44 years-old patients) and sex (higher in 10-34 years-old females) and increased with the length of stay of the index admission. The risk of readmission at 7 days was 1.1% and was higher for the shortest lengths of stay. Readmissions for asthma are pertinent indicators for the monitoring of asthma, especially the clinical management of the disease. Using data from an increasing number of years, together with linkage of hospital admissions and asthma drug reimbursement data, should allow a better understanding of severe asthma in France.

The management of patients with retained foreign bodies in the rectum: from surgeon with respect. The introduction of foreign bodies into the rectum is not an uncommon medical problem. The phenomenon has increased in the homosexual population. In a 25-year period we have encountered 34 patients with retained rectal foreign bodies. We have performed five laparotomies due to perforation and a laparotomy in order to retrieve a large wooden object. We have observed only one complication in a woman who developed a retrovaginal fistula. In order to obtain successful extraction of the foreign body the surgeon, apart from the well-known techniques, must exercise a high degree of ingenuity. Finally, it should be emphasized that the appropriate respect should be shown to all patients who seek treatment for this problem.

Caring for frail elders with musculoskeletal conditions and family caregivers' subjective well-being: The role of multidimensional caregiver burden. The present study examined the unique set of correlates of each dimension of the burden experienced by family caregivers of frail elders with musculoskeletal (MSK) conditions in China, and the role of caregiver burden in between caregiver stressors and subjective well-being. The data was derived from a community sample of 494 elder-caregiver dyads from six urban districts of Shanghai (China). The elders were aged 75 or above, needed assistance in activities of daily living (ADL) and had MSK conditions. The family caregivers were these elders' primary caregivers and at the age of 18 or older. Path analysis was used to examine the proposed model. Care recipients' functional health, cognitive status and behavioral problems affected the multiple dimensions of caregiver burden differently. These three stressors also indirectly affected caregivers' subjective well-being through physical, social and developmental burden. The findings highlighted the mediator role of caregiver burden in between caregiver stressors and subjective well-being, which supported burden-as-mediator theory in understanding family caregiving for frail elders with musculoskeletal conditions in a Chinese context. The focus of intervention should be varied according to the levels of the primary stressors. Policy and intervention implications with regard to the ways of helping Chinese families care for their frail elders with MSK conditions were discussed.

Hypoxia-altered signaling pathways of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in human corneal epithelial cells. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), a member of the TLR family, is an important pattern recognition molecule that plays a role in the host's innate immune responses to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a component of gram-negative bacteria. Contact lens wear is one of the risk factors for bacterial keratitis. The purpose of this study was to determine whether hypoxia or contact lens wear alters the TLR4 signaling pathways in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). A simian virus 40-immortalized human corneal epithelial cell (SV40-HCEC) line was cultured under 20% O2 or 2% O2 and exposed to LPS. The expression of TLR4, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and IL-8 was determined using a real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was also used to determine whether the nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) was activated in the SV40-HCEs. HCECs were obtained from 17 healthy volunteers and 18 hydrogel soft contact lens (SCL) wearers using impression cytology (IC), and the expression of the mRNA of TLR4 was determined using real-time RT-PCR. A reduction in the expression of the mRNA and protein of TLR4 was detected in SV40-HCECs cultured under hypoxic conditions. Hypoxia also attenuated both the LPS-induced expression of IL-6 and IL-8, and the activation of NFkappaB in SV40-HCECs. The expression of the mRNA of TLR4 was down-regulated in the HCECs of soft contact lens wearers. These results indicate that hypoxia attenuates the TLR4 signaling pathway in HCECs, suggesting that the increase in the susceptibility to bacterial infections under hypoxic conditions may be related to the TLR4 signaling pathways.

Autoimmune pancreatitis associated with various extrapancreatic lesions during a long-term clinical course successfully treated with azathioprine and corticosteroid maintenance therapy. Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is often associated with systemic extrapancreatic lesions, and the concept of IgG4-related autoimmune disease has been proposed. We report a 62-year-old woman with AIP associated with various extrapancreatic lesions during a long-term clinical course. These extrapancreatic lesions occurred after the withdrawal of steroid therapy. Sclerosing sialadenitis occurred before AIP, whereas autoimmune sensorineural hearing loss, allergic purpura and endocapillary proliferative glomerulonephritis occurred after AIP. However, no relapse was observed for 5 years after the start of maintenance therapy with prednisolone and azathioprine.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa pleural empyema in a preterm infant. Pleural empyema is defined as the pyogenic infection of the pleural space with purulent effusion. Although it is frequently seen in children and therapy protocols have been developed for it, there are only a few reports about pleural empyema in newborn infants. To our knowledge, just one preterm infant has been reported in the literature. In this article, we report an male infant born at 29 weeks of gestation who had pleural empyema on the 53rd day of life. Multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) was isolated from his pleural fluid culture. We suggest that this is the first preterm infant with P. aeruginosa empyema.

Age at diagnosis and age at death in familial prostate cancer. A family history of prostate cancer is associated with a higher risk for prostate cancer to first-degree relatives. If greater surveillance of men at familial risk is considered to be useful, population-based estimates of the differences in the age at diagnosis between familial and sporadic prostate cancer cases are needed. The men in the nationwide Swedish Family-Cancer Database were classified according to the number and type of affected first-degree relatives (father or brother) and according to the relative's age at diagnosis. The cumulative incidence of prostate cancer and cumulative prostate cancer-specific mortality were estimated using a stratified Cox model. The cumulative incidence was highest for men with multiple affected first-degree relatives, and it was higher for brothers than for sons of prostate cancer patients. The age to reach the same cumulative incidence as the general population at age 55 years decreased with decreasing age at diagnosis of the relative, ranging from 48.7 years (father diagnosed before 60 years of age) to 53.7 years (father diagnosed after 82 years of age). Prostate cancer-specific mortality was also related to the number and type of affected relatives but there was no clear evidence for a dependency on the age at diagnosis of the relative. Men with a father or a brother affected by prostate cancer are diagnosed and die at earlier ages than men without a family history of prostate cancer. This study should encourage further analysis in order to assess the risks and benefits of screening for prostate cancer in men at higher risk.

Wnt-5a regulates proliferation in lung cancer cells. Wnt-5a is important in the physiological development and differentiation of lung and is also involved in the regulating proliferation, differentiation and invasion of tumor cells. However, very little is known about the roles of Wnt-5a in the development of lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to explore the role of Wnt-5a in the development of the non-small cell lung cancer, through constructing plasmids containing Wnt-5a sense gene siRNA. We constructed the plasmids containing the Wnt-5a sense gene and siRNA eukaryotic expression vector and transfected it into the human lung squamous carcinoma cell line H157 and adenocarcinoma cell line A549. Expression of Wnt-5a RNA and protein and proliferation of the cells were measured. Expression of Wnt-5a protein significantly stimulated cell proliferation and transfection with siRNA plasmids suppressed Wnt-5 expression and cell proliferation. The human plasmids containing Wnt-5a sense gene and siRNA eukaryotic expression vector was successfully constructed and transfection to human cancer cells induces cell proliferation. siRNA actively suppressed Wnt-5a expression.

The degradation and adsorption behaviors of enzyme on poly(butylene succinate) single crystals. The enzymatic degradation behavior of poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) single crystals with a lipase from Pseudomonas cepacia (lipase PS) is monitored using atomic force microscopy (AFM) in phosphate buffer at pH 6.8 and 40 degrees C. In-situ AFM results show that enzymatic degradation of the single crystal starts from the crystal edges rather than the chain-folded surfaces and the lamellar thickness remains constant during the whole degradation process. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) is used for the first time to study the adsorption behavior of lipase onto the PBS crystal surface. The results clearly show that the enzyme molecules preferentially adsorb on the lateral surfaces of the single crystal but not on the chain-folded surfaces. AFM force-distance curve measurements and force-volume imaging obtained using a lipase-immobilized AFM tip show that small and large adhesive forces exist in the flat-on and edge-on areas of a PBS banded spherulite, respectively, which correspond to the chain-folded surface and lateral edges of a single crystal.

Shaping brain development: mouse communal nesting blunts adult neuroendocrine and behavioral response to social stress and modifies chronic antidepressant treatment outcome. Early experiences shape brain function and behavior and, consequently, vulnerability to psychopathology at adulthood. Here we exploited the mouse communal nest (CN) paradigm in order to investigate the effect of the early social environment on the emergence of endophenotypes of depression and on antidepressant efficacy at adulthood. CN, which consists in a single nest where three mothers keep their pups together and share care-giving behavior until weaning, is characterized by high levels of maternal behavior and peer interactions, thus representing an highly stimulating environment. Our results show that, when compared to mice reared in standard laboratory conditions (SN), adult CN mice exhibited greater sucrose preference on the first days of the test, displayed reduced anhedonia during social stress and had lower corticosterone levels after acute and prolonged social stress. Furthermore, in line with previous work, CN displayed longer immobility than SN mice in the forced swim test. Here we show that such behavioral response is differently affected by antidepressants according to early experiences. A 3-week fluoxetine treatment affected only SN mice, leading to an increase of immobility duration up to the levels showed by CN mice, while acute fluoxetine administration decreased immobility duration in both groups. These results show that being reared in a CN profoundly changes developmental trajectories, reducing the adult display of endophenotypes of depression and modifying response to antidepressants. The present findings suggest that early experiences represent one of those factors to be taken into account to identify the appropriate individual pharmacological strategy to treat depression in patients.

Retrospective study of association between choice of vasopressor given during spinal anaesthesia for high-risk caesarean delivery and fetal pH. Phenylephrine given during spinal anaesthesia for low-risk caesarean section is associated with higher fetal pH than ephedrine. However, there is little evidence on the effects of ephedrine and phenylephrine in complicated pregnancies. The aim of this study was to compare umbilical artery pH with phenylephrine and ephedrine given during spinal anaesthesia where caesarean section was performed because of an increased risk of fetal compromise. We reviewed the case notes of all women at our hospital from 2000-2003 who had undergone high-risk caesarean section under spinal anaesthesia, where umbilical artery and venous pH had been recorded at delivery. Umbilical artery pH was compared by choice of vasopressor and multiple regression analysis was used to investigate the effects of other possible confounding variables. One hundred and fifteen patients received no vasopressor, 122 ephedrine (group E) and 148 phenylephrine (group P). The median umbilical artery pH was 7.26 (IQR 7.21-7.30) for the no-vasopressor group, 7.27 (7.22-7.30) for group E and 7.28 (7.22-7.32) for group P (P=0.21). Using multiple regression analysis, the only variable associated with altered umbilical artery pH was a non-reassuring fetal heart trace. Umbilical artery pH was similar whether ephedrine or phenylephrine was used to maintain maternal arterial pressure, which contrasts with studies of low-risk caesarean section.

Irritancy and repellency behavioral responses of three strains of Aedes aegypti exposed to DDT and alpha-cypermethrin. This study quantified both contact irritancy and noncontact repellency behavioral responses of three strains of Aedes aegypti (L.) (one long-term colony and two F1-F2 generation field-caught strains) to field application rates of DDT (2 g/m2) and alpha-cypermethrin (ACyp) (0.025 g/m2) by using an excito-repellency test chamber. The colony The colony strain (USDA) was completely susceptible to DDT and ACyp. One field strain was collected from Chiang Mai (CM) Province, northern Thailand, and was characterized as tolerant (reduced susceptibility) to DDT and completely susceptible to ACyp. The second field strain, collected from Kanchanaburi (KAN) Province, western Thailand, was highly resistant to DDT but fully susceptible to ACyp. All three strains exhibited marked irritancy to contact with ACyp, with more pronounced escape responses occurring in the two field strains. With DDT, the KAN strain demonstrated the lowest escape response during both contact and noncontact trials, whereas a greater response was seen in trials conducted with CM and USDA strains. With exposure to ACyp, repellency was less profound than irritancy but still resulted in a significant escape response compared with paired controls without insecticide (P < 0.05). DDT elicited both irritancy and repellency responses but comparably greater spatial repellency than ACyp. Findings indicate ACyp functions primarily as a strong contact irritant, whereas DDT functions as a relatively strong noncontact repellent in the strains tested. The higher the degree of physiological resistance to DDT, the greater the apparent suppression of both behavioral avoidance responses. Most importantly, observations using susceptible, tolerant, and resistant Ae. aegypti strains show that behavioral responses that can interrupt human-vector contact still occur regardless of degree of physiological susceptibility to compounds tested.

Electrodermal measures of Jing-Well points and their clinical relevance in endometriosis-related chronic pelvic pain. To determine whether electrodermal measures at Jing-Well acupuncture points, "indicator" points located at the tips of fingers and toes are associated with clinical measures in adolescent women with chronic pelvic pain. The design of this study was a randomized sham-controlled trial. Analyses of electrodermal measures were based on longitudinal, multivariable analyses using generalized estimating equations. The subjects were 14 young women (ages 14-22) with laparoscopically diagnosed endometriosis and chronic pelvic pain. Subjects were randomized to sham acupuncture or Japanese-style active acupuncture. Sixteen (16) treatments were administered over 8 weeks. Using a Hibiki-7 device, electrodermal impedance measures were obtained at all 24 Jing-Well points for each treatment visit. From these readings, measures of "imbalance" were determined by calculating statistical dispersion (statistical deviation and Gini coefficient) and level of asymmetry (left-right, top-bottom, and yin-yang). Clinical outcome measures were obtained at baseline, week 4, and week 8 and included level of pelvic pain, Endometriosis Health Profile, Pediatric Quality of Life, perceived stress, and inflammatory cytokine levels (interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha). Participants designated to the acupuncture group had, on average, a substantial decrease in statistical dispersion and asymmetry of Hibiki-7 values over the course of treatment compared to the sham group. Electrodermal asymmetry variables, specifically either yin-yang or left-right measure, were significantly associated with pelvic pain, Endometriosis Health Profile, Pediatric Quality of Life, and Perceived Stress even after adjusting for treatment designation. No associations between electrodermal balance measures and inflammatory cytokines were found. Electrodermal measures may be significantly associated with clinical outcome and acupuncture treatments in adolescent women with chronic pelvic pain.

Expulsion of amplified MYCN from homogenously staining chromosomal regions in neuroblastoma cell lines after cultivation with cisplatin, doxorubicin, hydroxyurea, and vincristine. Amplified MYCN, common in neuroblastomas, can be detected as double minutes (dmin) or homogenously staining chromosomal regions (hsr). Expulsion of amplified MYCN has only been described in dmin. We used hydroxyurea (HU), which accelerates the expulsion of amplified genes and cytostatics (used in neuroblastoma therapy), to describe MYCN amplification changes after chemotherapy. We used IMR-32, SK-N-AS, UKF-NB-2, UKF-NB-3, UKF-NB-4, and derived sublines resistant to doxorubicin, cisplatin, and vincristine. The loss of amplified MYCN copies was investigated using comparative genomic hybridization and by fluorescent in situ hybridization. We found expulsion of amplified MYCN from hsr in UKF-NB-4 and IMR-32 cell lines, and determined the exact number of amplified MYCN copies. After the first cultivation with HU, some amplified MYCN was lost. UKF-NB-4 lost 20 copies on average, and IMR-32 lost 15 copies (P<0.001). After the second cultivation, cells without MYCN amplification were found. In comparison to sensitive cell lines, drug-resistant cell lines lost 17 copies on average. Our data show that expulsion of amplified MYCN genes is also possible from hsr and may be induced, not only by HU, but by other cytostatics as well.

Expression of transient receptor potential channels and two-pore potassium channels in subtypes of vagal afferent neurons in rat. Vagal afferent neurons relay important information regarding the control of the gastrointestinal system. However, the ionic mechanisms that underlie vagal activation induced by sensory inputs are not completely understood. We postulate that transient receptor potential (TRP) channels and/or two-pore potassium (K2p) channels are targets for activating vagal afferents. In this study we explored the distribution of these channels in vagal afferents by quantitative PCR after a capsaicin treatment to eliminate capsaicin-sensitive neurons, and by single-cell PCR measurements in vagal afferent neurons cultured after retrograde labeling from the stomach or duodenum. We found that TRPC1/3/5/6, TRPV1-4, TRPM8, TRPA1, TWIK2, TRAAK, TREK1, and TASK1/2 were all present in rat nodose ganglia. Both lesion results and single-cell PCR results suggested that TRPA1 and TRPC1 were preferentially expressed in neurons that were either capsaicin sensitive or TRPV1 positive. Expression of TRPM8 varied dynamically after various manipulations, which perhaps explains the disparate results obtained by different investigators. Last, we also examined ion channel distribution with the A-type CCK receptor (CCK-R(A)) and found there was a significant preference for neurons that express TRAAK to also express CCK-R(A), especially in gut-innervating neurons. These findings, combined with findings from prior studies, demonstrated that background conductances such as TRPC1, TRPA1, and TRAAK are indeed differentially distributed in the nodose ganglia, and not only do they segregate with specific markers, but the degree of overlap is also dependent on the innervation target.

Hydrolysis of cefazolin by enzymes produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa after exposure to ceftazidime in vitro. Sometimes resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Ps. aeruginosa) is developed during antibiotic treatment, in spite of the initial susceptibility in vitro. The aim of this study was to use an in vitro model for the study of the development of resistant strains of Ps. aeruginosa after a short exposure to ceftazidime, and to study the hydrolysing capacity of beta-lactamases produced by the resistant strains. Among 563 clinical strains of Ps. aeruginosa, 37 multisensitive strains were collected for the study. After being identified, strains with simultaneous sensitivity to 5 expanded spectrum cephalosporins were chosen. For each strain, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the 5 expanded spectrum cephalosporins was determined, and the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) was excluded by the double-disc synergy diffusion test. Strains non producing ESBL were cultivated in concentrations of ceftazidime equal to MICx2 and MICx4. After 24 hours of culture, the development of resistant strains was estimated and the cephalosporinase activity of the produced beta-lactamases was determined by their ability to hydrolyse cefazolin. Hydrolysis of cefazolin was studied by measuring the change of its absorbance on 272 nm using a Shimadzu 160A spectrophotometer. The hydrolyzing capacity of the enzymes was expressed as the percentage of the antibiotic, which was hydrolysed in 10 sec. A total of 60% and 50% of strains developed resistant strains after exposure to ceftazidime in concentration MICx2 and MICx4, respectively. The hydrolyzing capacity of the original strains was 15-36% while the hydrolyzing capacity of the resistant strains was 10-73%. Totally 64% of the resistant strains expressed higher hydrolyzing capacity than the original strains. Regardless of the susceptibility test results, Ps. aeruginosa presented a high tendency to develop resistant strains after a short exposure to ceftazidime in vitro. In most cases the resistant strains expressed higher cephalosporinase activity than the original strains, suggesting derepression of chromosomal beta-lactamases. Our model offers a simple, inexpensive and rapid method for detecting resistance of Ps. aeruginosa developed due to derepression of beta-lactamases, and for discriminating resistant strains with derepressed beta-lactamases from strains that developed other mechanisms of resistance.

Assessment of the specificity of a new folate-targeted photosensitizer for peritoneal metastasis of epithelial ovarian cancer to enable intraperitoneal photodynamic therapy. A preclinical study. Ovarian cancer's prognosis remains dire after primary therapy. Recurrence rate is disappointingly high as 60% of women with epithelial ovarian cancer considered in remission will develop recurrent disease within 5 years. Special attention to undetected peritoneal metastasis during surgery is necessary as they are the main predictive factors of recurrences. Folate Receptor Î± (FRÎ±) shows promising prospects in targeting ovarian cancerous cells and intraperitoneal photodynamic therapy (PDT) could be a solution in addition to macroscopic cytoreductive surgery to treat peritoneal micrometastasis. The aim of this preclinical study is to assess the specificity of a folate-targeted photosensitizer for ovarian peritoneal micrometastasis. We used the NuTu-19 epithelial ovarian cancer cell line to induce peritoneal carcinomatosis in female Fischer 344 rats. Three groups of 6 rats were studied (Control (no photosensitizer)/Non-conjugated photosensitizer (Porph)/Folate-conjugated photosensitizer (Porph-s-FA)). Four hours after the administration of the photosensitizer, animals were sacrificed and intraperitoneal organs tissues were sampled. FRÎ± tissue expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Tissue incorporation of photosensitizers was assessed by confocal microscopy and tissue quantification. FRÎ± is overexpressed in tumor, ovary, and liver whereas, peritoneum, colon, small intestine, and kidney do not express it. Cytoplasmic red endocytosis vesicles observed by confocal microscopy are well correlated to FRÎ± tissue expression. Photosensitizer tissue quantification shows a mean tumor-to-normal tissue ratio of 9.6. We demonstrated that this new generation folate-targeted photosensitizer is specific of epithelial ovarian peritoneal metastasis and may allow the development of efficient and safe intraperitoneal PDT procedure.

Assessment of the variability of vastii myoelectric activity in young healthy females during walking: a statistical gait analysis. The study was designed to assess the natural variability of the activation modalities of vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) during walking at a self-selected speed and cadence of 30 young, healthy, females. This was achieved by conducting statistical gait analysis on the surface electromyographic signals from hundreds of strides for each subject. Results revealed variability in the number of activations, occurrence frequency, and onset-offset instants across the thousands of strides analyzed. However, despite the variability, there was one activation occurrence which remained consistent across subjects for both VM and VL. This occurred from terminal swing to the following loading response (observed in 100% of strides). A second, less frequent, activation occurred between mid-stance up to pre-swing (observed in 39.3Â±22.4% of strides for VM and in 35.1Â±20.6% for VL). No significant differences (p>0.05) were observed in the onset-offset instants or in the occurrence frequency, which suggest a simultaneous recruitment of VM and VL. This "normality" pattern represents the first attempt at developing a reference frame for vastii sEMG activity during walking, that is able to include the physiological variability of the phenomenon and control the confounding effects of age and gender. 


Allele-specific CDH1 downregulation and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.

Restoration of photoreceptor outer segment after vitrectomy for retinal detachment. To report photoreceptor restoration and visual outcomes after vitrectomy for retinal detachment. Retrospective, observational case series. We prospectively studied the tomographic features of reattached retinas in 20 eyes with a macula-off rhegmatogenous retinal detachment using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography 1, 3, and 6 months after 3-port vitrectomy with SF(6) gas tamponade. All eyes were examined more than 3 months after surgery. The optical coherence tomography foveal findings were classified as a disrupted inner segment and outer segment (IS/OS) line, a residual foveal detachment, and a continuous IS/OS line. A disrupted IS/OS line was seen in 11 eyes (55%) at 1 month and in 8 eyes (40%) at 3 months, a foveal detachment was seen in 8 eyes (40%) at 1 month and in 7 eyes (35%) at 3 months, and a continuous IS/OS line was seen in 1 eye (5%) at 1 month and in 5 eyes (25%) at 3 months. In 18 eyes followed up for 6 months, optical coherence tomography showed a disrupted IS/OS line in 3 eyes (17%), a foveal detachment in 6 eyes (33%), and a continuous IS/OS line in 9 eyes (50%). The mean best-corrected visual acuities at 1 and 6 months were 0.26 and 0.16 with a disrupted IS/OS line, 0.60 and 0.95 with a foveal detachment, and 0.8 and 0.95 with a continuous IS/OS line. The mean best-corrected visual acuity was significantly (P < .0001) lower with a disrupted IS/OS line compared with the other formations at 6 months. The IS/OS line at the fovea recovered gradually after surgery. The postoperative visual acuity was correlated with a restored IS/OS line.

Arthroscopic repair of circumferential lesions of the glenoid labrum. Symptomatic pan-labral or circumferential (360 degrees ) tears of the glenohumeral labrum are an uncommon injury. The purpose of the present study was to report the results of surgical treatment of circumferential lesions of the glenoid labrum with use of validated outcome instruments. From July 2003 to May 2006, forty-one shoulders in thirty-nine patients (thirty-four men and five women) with a mean age of 25.1 years were prospectively enrolled in a multicenter study and were managed for a circumferential (360 degrees ) lesion of the glenoid labrum. All patients had a primary diagnosis of pain and recurrent shoulder instability, and all underwent arthroscopic repair of the circumferential labral tear with a mean of 7.1 suture anchors. The outcomes for thirty-nine of the forty-one shoulders were assessed after a mean duration of follow-up of 31.8 months on the basis of the rating of pain and instability on a scale of 0 to 10, a physical examination, and three outcome instruments (the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score, the modified American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, and the Short Form-12 score). Significant improvement was noted in terms of the mean pain score (from 4.3 to 1.1), the mean instability score (from 7.3 to 0.2), the mean modified American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (from 55.5 to 89.6), the mean Short Form-12 score (from 75.7 to 90.0), and the mean Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation score (from 36.7 to 88.5). Six shoulders required revision surgery because of recurrent instability (two), recalcitrant biceps tendinitis (two), or postoperative tightness (two). All patients returned to their preinjury activity level. Pan-labral or circumferential lesions are an uncommon yet extensive injury of the glenohumeral joint that may result in recurrent instability and pain. The present study demonstrates that arthroscopic capsulolabral repair with suture anchor fixation can restore the stability of the glenohumeral joint and can provide a reliable improvement in subjective and objective outcome measures.

Attitude of women with abortion-related complications toward provision of safe abortion services in Ghana. To determine the attitude and perception of women with abortion-related complications toward the provision of safe abortion services, their sociodemographic characteristics, and their awareness of the law permitting abortion under certain circumstances in Ghana. A cross-sectional study using a standardized questionnaire was conducted over a 2-month period among patients admitted with abortion-related complications at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital (KATH), Kumasi, Ghana. Abortion-related complications accounted for 42.7% of admissions to the gynecological ward. The median age of the women was 26 years. Of the 296 patients interviewed, 28% reported induced abortion in the index pregnancy, 29% were not married, 30% had no formal education, and 92% were not aware of the current legal status of abortion in Ghana. They thought there was the need to provide safe abortion services in the country, and almost all of them were willing to patronize such services. Awareness of the current legal status of abortion was lacking among women with abortion-related complications attending a tertiary center in Kumasi. However, the provision of safe abortion services was much needed in this population.

Distal Ureteric Stones and Tamsulosin: A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Multicenter Trial. We assess the efficacy and safety of tamsulosin compared with placebo as medical expulsive therapy in patients with distal ureteric stones less than or equal to 10 mm in diameter. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial of adult participants with calculus on computed tomography (CT). Patients were allocated to 0.4 mg of tamsulosin or placebo daily for 28 days. The primary outcomes were stone expulsion on CT at 28 days and time to stone expulsion. There were 403 patients randomized, 81.4% were men, and the median age was 46 years. The median stone size was 4.0 mm in the tamsulosin group and 3.7 mm in the placebo group. Of 316 patients who received CT at 28 days, stone passage occurred in 140 of 161 (87.0%) in the tamsulosin group and 127 of 155 (81.9%) with placebo, a difference of 5.0% (95% confidence interval -3.0% to 13.0%). In a prespecified subgroup analysis of large stones (5 to 10 mm), 30 of 36 (83.3%) tamsulosin participants had stone passage compared with 25 of 41 (61.0%) with placebo, a difference of 22.4% (95% confidence interval 3.1% to 41.6%) and number needed to treat of 4.5. There was no difference in urologic interventions, time to self-reported stone passage, pain, or analgesia requirements. Adverse events were generally mild and did not differ between groups. We found no benefit overall of 0.4 mg of tamsulosin daily for patients with distal ureteric calculi less than or equal to 10 mm in terms of spontaneous passage, time to stone passage, pain, or analgesia requirements. In the subgroup with large stones (5 to 10 mm), tamsulosin did increase passage and should be considered.

Heavily Oiled Salt Marsh following the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill, Ecological Comparisons of Shoreline Cleanup Treatments and Recovery. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill affected hundreds of kilometers of coastal wetland shorelines, including salt marshes with persistent heavy oiling that required intensive shoreline "cleanup" treatment. Oiled marsh treatment involves a delicate balance among: removing oil, speeding the degradation of remaining oil, protecting wildlife, fostering habitat recovery, and not causing further ecological damage with treatment. To examine the effectiveness and ecological effects of treatment during the emergency response, oiling characteristics and ecological parameters were compared over two years among heavily oiled test plots subject to: manual treatment, mechanical treatment, natural recovery (no treatment, oiled control), as well as adjacent reference conditions. An additional experiment compared areas with and without vegetation planting following treatment. Negative effects of persistent heavy oiling on marsh vegetation, intertidal invertebrates, and shoreline erosion were observed. In areas without treatment, oiling conditions and negative effects for most marsh parameters did not considerably improve over two years. Both manual and mechanical treatment were effective at improving oiling conditions and vegetation characteristics, beginning the recovery process, though recovery was not complete by two years. Mechanical treatment had additional negative effects of mixing oil into the marsh soils and further accelerating erosion. Manual treatment appeared to strike the right balance between improving oiling and habitat conditions while not causing additional detrimental effects. However, even with these improvements, marsh periwinkle snails showed minimal signs of recovery through two years, suggesting that some ecosystem components may lag vegetation recovery. Planting following treatment quickened vegetation recovery and reduced shoreline erosion. Faced with comparable marsh oiling in the future, we would recommend manual treatment followed by planting. We caution against the use of intensive treatment methods with lesser marsh oiling. Oiled controls (no treatment "set-asides") are essential for judging marsh treatment effectiveness and ecological effects; we recommend their use when applying intensive treatment methods.

Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of renal denervation in treatment-resistant hypertension. The blood pressure (BP)-lowering effect of renal sympathetic nervous denervation (RDN) in resistant hypertension (rHT) shows large variation among studies. We meta-analyzed summary statistics of randomized clinical trials on RDN in rHT. For continuous outcomes, we assessed heterogeneity by Cochran's Q test and used random-effect models weighted for the inverse of the variance. We assessed safety by assessing the risk of major adverse events from stratified contingency tables. Of 5652 patients screened in seven trials, 985 (17.4%) qualified and were randomized to control (n = 397) or RDN with SYMPLICITY(â¢) catheters (n = 588). Follow-up was 6 months. In both control and RDN patients, antihypertensive treatment was continued or optimized. At enrolment, age averaged 58.1 years, systolic/diastolic office and 24 h BP 168.5/93.3 mmHg and 151.8/86.1 mmHg, respectively, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) 79.3 ml/min/1.73 mÂ². For BP outcomes, there was heterogeneity among trials. Pooled effects (control minus RDN) were -4.9/-3.5 mmHg (95% confidence interval, -20.9 to 11.1/-8.9 to 1.9) for office BP, -2.8/-1.5 mmHg (-6.5 to 0.8/-3.3 to 0.4) for 24 h BP and 0.81 ml/min/1.73 mÂ² (-1.69 to 3.30) for eGFR. Removing one trial at a time produced confirmatory results. Adverse events occurred in 7.4% and 9.9% of control and RDN patients, respectively (p = 0.24). In selected rHT patients maintained on antihypertensive drugs, RDN with the SYMPLICITY systems does not significantly decrease BP but is safe. Future trials with next-generation catheters should aim at identifying responders in patients with evidence of sympathetic nervous overactivity.

Photochemical processes observed during the reaction of superoxide reductase from Desulfoarculus baarsii with superoxide: re-evaluation of the reaction mechanism. Superoxide reductase SOR is an enzyme involved in superoxide detoxification in some microorganisms. Its active site consists of a non-heme ferrous center in an unusual [Fe(NHis)(4) (SCys)(1)] square pyramidal pentacoordination that efficiently reduces superoxide into hydrogen peroxide. In previous works, the reaction mechanism of the SOR from Desulfoarculus baarsii enzyme, studied by pulse radiolysis, was shown to involve the formation of two reaction intermediates T1 and T2. However, the absorption spectrum of T2 was reported with an unusual sharp band at 625 nm, very different from that reported for other SORs. In this work, we show that the sharp band at 625 nm observed by pulse radiolysis reflects the presence of photochemical processes that occurs at the level of the transient species formed during the reaction of SOR with superoxide. These processes do not change the stoichiometry of the global reaction. These data highlight remarkable photochemical properties for these reaction intermediates, not previously suspected for iron-peroxide species formed in the SOR active site. We have reinvestigated the reaction mechanism of the SOR from D. baarsii by pulse radiolysis in the absence of these photochemical processes. The T1 and T2 intermediates now appear to have absorption spectra similar to those reported for the Archaeoglobus fulgidus SOR enzymes. Although for some enzymes of the family only one transient was reported, on the whole, the reaction mechanisms of the different SORs studied so far seem very similar, which is in agreement with the strong sequence and structure homologies of their active sites.

Subclinical myopathy in patients affected with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer at clinical onset of disease: evidence from skeletal muscle biopsies. To evaluate skeletal muscle biopsy from asymptomatic patients affected with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer and to identify pathological features which may be indicative of tumor-associated muscle disorders, potentially leading to cachexia. Patients affected with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer at clinical onset of disease underwent biopsy of the rectus abdominis muscle during elective laparoscopic tumor resection, before chemotherapeutic treatment. Morphometric analyses, ATPase histochemistry and immunohistochemical studies using antibodies directed to N-CAM and to MHC-emb, two sound makers of muscle denervation and injury-induced muscle regeneration, were performed on intraoperative muscle biopsies from ten patients. Muscle biopsies from rectus abdominis of seven subjects affected with non-neoplastic condition, which underwent laparoscopic surgery, were used as controls. In patients' biopsies, we observed a surprisingly high percentage of myofibers with internalized or central nuclei compared to controls (9.15 +/- 8.9 versus 0.6 +/- 0.9, p<0.0003). In addition, in the 30% of patients, small myofibers expressing the MHC-emb have been identified (0.4 +/- 0.5 positive fibers/mm(2)), while in 50% of patients, larger fibers positive for N-CAM have also been detected (0.7 +/- 1.1 positive fibers/mm(2)), suggesting that investigated muscle biopsies exhibit other evidence of muscle fiber injury/regeneration and/or denervation. Among the 10,000 analysed myofibers in control biopsies, no MHC-emb and N-CAM-positive muscle fibers have been detected. Thus, patients affected with newly diagnosed colorectal cancer at clinical onset of disease display early signs of a subclinical myopathy. Factors and mechanisms of this cancer-associated myopathy are yet unknown. The facts that the great majority of the abnormally nucleated myofibers are of the fast type and that regenerating myofibers are present, suggest a myogenic response to the colorectal cancer and not to the laparoscopic modalities of the biopsy harvesting. Follow-up of the patients will elucidate the clinical relevance of our observation, and further studies investigating the molecular mechanism underlying this early cancer-associated myopathy will hopefully provide some pathogenetic clues leading to the identification of potential specific targets for therapeutic intervention to prevent tumor cachexia.

Fine structural study of the innervation of muscle spindles in the internal oblique muscle of the abdominal wall in the adult mouse. We examined by electron microscopy the innervation of muscle spindles in the internal oblique muscle of the mouse abdominal wall. In the equatorial region, in addition to the sensory innervation on individual intrafusal muscle fibers, sensory cross terminals were often observed between nuclear chain fibers. In the area from the juxtaequatorial region to the polar region, nuclear bag fibers were supplied by trail and plate-type motor endings, while nuclear chain fibers were innervated by sensory endings, being probably secondary sensory endings. From these findings, it is clear that the innervation patterns differ between two types of intrafusal muscle fibers.

Significant changes in the transesterification activity of free and mesoporous-immobilized Rhizopus oryzae lipase in ionic liquids. We examined the activity of free Rhizopus oryzae lipase (ROL) and ROL immobilized on mesoporous materials in transesterification reactions in various dialkylimidazolium-cation based ionic liquids. For free ROL, the highest activity (0.39 U/mg protein) was obtained in [OMIm][PF(6)] followed by that (0.28 U/mg protein) in [BMIm][PF(6)]. Specific activities of ROL immobilized on mesocellular foam (MCF) were only 0.47 and 0.43 U/mg protein in [OMIm][PF(6)] and [BMIm][PF(6)], respectively. However, the specific activities of ROL immobilized on octadecyl functionalized MCF (C(18)-MCF) increased significantly to 15.64 and 14.84 U/mg protein in [OMIm][PF(6)] and [BMIm][PF(6)], respectively. Consequently, ROL immobilized on C(18)-MCF is a promising biocatalyst for biotransformation reactions in ionic liquids.

Role of YiaX2 in L-ascorbate transport in Klebsiella pneumoniae 13882. The yiaK-S operon is required for aerobic growth on L-ascorbate in several Enterobacteriaceae. Here we present evidence that the yiaX2 gene belonging to the yiaK-S operon of Klebsiella pneumoniae 13882, which encodes a protein similar to the putative transporters classified as the major facilitator superfamily, is involved in the uptake of L-ascorbate. Concentration kinetic analysis yielded an apparent K(m) of YiaX2 for L-ascorbate of 161.38 +/-8.28 micromol x L(-1) and a Vmax of 3.81 +/- 0.60 nmol x mg(-1) x min(-1). This carrier uses the energy from electrochemical gradients, since it was inhibited by carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, a hydrophobic proton conductor that dissipates proton motive force.

Targeting endothelin A receptor enhances anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects of the HER2 antibody trastuzumab in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is frequently overexpressed in human breast cancers. It is known to drive tumor growth and progression and represents a prominent target in breast cancer therapy. The endothelin (ET) system, in particular ET-1 and its receptor ET(A)R, is of major relevance for breast cancer growth and invasion. Having previously demonstrated coexpression of ET(A)R and HER2 in breast tumors, this study was designed to investigate molecular interactions of HER2 (including the epidermal growth factor receptor EGFR as its major coreceptor) and ET signaling, and the potential benefit of a combined anti-HER2/ET(A)R treatment in human breast cancer cells. Dual HER2-ET(A)R targeting utilizing trastuzumab (monoclonal anti-HER2 antibody) and the ET(A)R antagonist atrasentan was superior to each agent alone in inhibiting basal and EGF-induced proliferation and invasion of HER2-overexpressing BT-474 and SK-BR-3 cells. EGF-induced invasion was partially inhibited by atrasentan alone, suggesting the involvement of ET(A)R in EGF receptor mediated invasion of breast cancer cells. Moreover, secretion of the pro-invasive ET-1 was shown to be induced by EGF via EGFR and HER2, including MAPK-dependent signaling. In turn, an ET-1/ET(A)R-dependent regulation of EGFR protein expression and phosphorylation (at Tyr845) was observed, which may contribute to the additional anti-proliferative and anti-invasive effects of atrasentan on trastuzumab treated cells; reconfirming, atrasentan failed to enhance inhibitory effects of EGFR-targeted agents. This study suggests complex interactions between HER2/EGFR and ET pathways in breast cancer and supports the hypothesis that dual HER2-ET(A)R targeting may represent a highly effective approach in breast cancer treatment.

Effect of Variations of Washing Solution Chemistry on Nanomaterial Physicochemical Changes in the Laundry Cycle. Engineered nanoparticle (ENP) life cycles are strongly dependent on the life-cycle of the nanoenhanced products in which they are incorporated. An important phase for ENP associated with textiles is washing. Using a set of liquid and powdered commercially available detergents that span a wide range of different chemistries, washing studies were performed with one "standard" nanoparticle suspended in wash solution to systematically investigate (changes to) particle size distribution, dissolution, reprecipitation (i.e., "new" particle formation), and complexation to particulate matter. Au ENPs were used as a "tracer" through the system. TEM and EDX analysis were performed to observe morphological and chemical changes to the particles, and single-particle ICP-MS was used to build a size distribution of particles in solution. Varying the washing solution chemistry was found to dictate the extent and rate of dissolution, particle destruction, surface chemistry change(s), and new particle formation. Detergent chemistry, dominated by oxidizing agents, was a major factor. The detergent form (i.e., powder vs liquid) was the other decisive factor, with powder forms providing available surfaces for precipitation and sorption reactions. Control experiments with AgNO3 indicated metallic Ag particles formed during the washing process from dissolved Ag, implying not all Ag-NPs observed in a textile washing study are indicative of released Ag-ENPs but can also be the result of sequential dissolution/reduction reactions.

Cellular and molecular characterization of ozone-induced pulmonary inflammation in the Cynomolgus monkey. We investigated the cellular and molecular effects of ozone exposure in Cynomolgus monkeys. Thirty-six Cynomolgus monkeys were exposed to single or repeat ozone challenge. Pulmonary inflammation was assessed using bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) and histology. Gene expression profiling in lung and blood was performed. Ozone challenge evoked BAL cellular inflammation and increases in total protein, alkaline phosphatase and cytokines. Lung histology revealed cellular inflammation and epithelial necrosis. Gene expression profiling identified oxidative phosphorylation, immune response and cell adhesion pathways altered in response to ozone, with common and unique profiles in lung and blood. Lipocalin 2, CD177, the FK-506 and S100A8 binding proteins and ST-2 represent novel peripheral biomarkers of ozone toxicity. Repeat ozone challenge evoked reproducible inflammation but attenuated cell damage. These studies provide data on the molecular mechanisms and biomarker identification of ozone-evoked toxicity, and support the use of the Cynomolgus monkey as a model of human ozone challenge.

The prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus. Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are common among patients with non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Our aim was to investigate the frequency of chronic GI symptoms in Korean patients with NIDDM. A cross-sectional survey, using a reliable and valid questionnaire, was performed in diabetes clinics from seven hospitals of the Catholic University of Korea. A total of 608 patients (249 males and 359 females, mean age 53.7+/-10.9 years) were investigated. The frequencies of weekly heartburn and acid regurgitation (esophageal symptoms) were 7.1% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.0 to 9.2) and 4.4% (95% CI, 2.8 to 6.1), respectively. The frequency of dyspepsia was 13.2% (95% CI, 10.5 to 15.8). The frequencies of constipation and diarrhea were 15.0% (95% CI, 12.2 to 18.0) and 5.3% (95% CI, 3.5 to 7.1), respectively. Nausea and the use of manual maneuvers to facilitate defecation were more prevalent in women than in men. Constipation and fecal incontinence were more common in diabetes patients with long duration (>10 years). Fecal incontinence and using laxatives were more frequent in the complicated diabetes group. Using laxatives was more frequent in the uncontrolled diabetes group. Two-thirds of diabetic patients experienced GI symptoms. The prevalence of GI symptoms was more common in patients who had diabetic complications and a long duration of diabetes.

An agonistic mAb directed to the TrkC receptor juxtamembrane region defines a trophic hot spot and interactions with p75 coreceptors. The D5 domain of TrkC receptors is a docking site for Neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), but other domains may be relevant for function or harmonizing signals with p75(NTR) coreceptors. We report a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 2B7 targeting the juxtamembrane domain of TrkC. mAb 2B7 binds to murine and human TrkC receptors and is a functional agonist that affords activation of TrkC, AKT, and MAPK. These signals result in cell survival but not in cellular differentiation. Monomeric 2B7 Fabs also affords cell survival. Binding of 2B7 mAb and 2B7 Fabs to TrkC are blocked by NT-3 in a dose-dependent manner but not by pro-NT-3. Expression of p75(NTR) coreceptors on the cell surface block the binding and function of mAb 2B7, whereas NT-3 binding and function are enhanced. mAb 2B7 defines a previously unknown neurotrophin receptor functional hot spot; that exclusively generates survival signals; that can be activated by non-dimeric ligands; and potentially unmasks a site for p75-TrkC interactions.

Cryptomerione induces Th1 cell polarization via influencing IL-10 production by cholera toxin-primed dendritic cells. Dendritic cells play an important role in the initiation and regulation of immune response. Dendritic cells have a key influence in the differentiation of naÃ¯ve T cells into Th1, Th2 or Th17 effector cells. Cryptomerione is terpene isolated from the heartwood of Cryptomeria japonica. In this study, we investigated the effects of Cryptomerione on the phenotypic and functional maturation of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells in vitro. Human monocytes were exposed to either Cryptomerione alone, or in combination with lipopolysaccaride (LPS) or cholera toxin (CT) and thereafter co-cultured with naÃ¯ve T cells. We found no enhanced CD1a, CD80, CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR expression on Cryptomerione-primed dendritic cells. However, Cryptomerione augmented T cell stimulatory capacity in an allogeneic mixed lymphocyte reaction to CT-primed dendritic cells and influenced the production of interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-12p70 by CT-primed dendritic cells, but not LPS-primed dendritic cells. Cryptomerione also inhibited Th2 cell polarization induced by CT-primed dendritic cells, but enhanced IFN-gamma secretion by naÃ¯ve T cells co-cultured with CT-primed dendritic cells. Cytokine production by CT-primed dendritic cells alone, or in combination with Cryptomerione was also influenced following treatment with anti-IL-10 mAb and anti-OX40L mAb. Thus, the potential mechanisms underlying the enhancement of Th1 polarization in CT-primed dendritic cells induced by Cryptomerione appeared to depend on IL-10 secretion and OX40L. These results suggest that Cryptomerione modulates human dendritic cells function in a fashion that favors Th1/Th2 cell polarization.

Antioxidative and cytoprotective response elicited by molybdenum nanoparticles in human cells. Nanotechnology based therapeutics can offer an alternative platform in a wide variety of biomedical applications. Here we report novel cytotoxicity preventive potential of molybdenum nanoparticles (Mo NPs) in human breast (MCF-7) and fibrosarcoma (HT-1080) cells compromised with oxidant exposure. Physicochemical properties such as size, crystallinity, purity and band gap (an optical characteristic) of Mo NPs were characterized respectively by field emission transmission electron microscopy (FETEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy dispersive spectrum (EDS) and UV-vis absorption spectroscopy. The average size of crystalline Mo NPs was found to be 35 nm with a band gap of 1.4 eV. Potential cytotoxicity of Mo NPs was evaluated by a battery of cell viability and oxidative stress parameters. Cell viability and oxidative stress data suggested Mo NPs to be reasonably non-cytotoxic. Cytotoxic preventive and GSH restoring potential of Mo NPs was determined against cytotoxicity and oxidative stress induced by H2O2 (and ZnO NPs) in two cells. Mo NPs significantly increased GSH level in MCF-7 and HT-1080 cells, an activity that was comparable to antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). GSH level was increased 1.56 times in MCF-7 cells and 1.25 times in HT-1080 cells by 100 Î¼g/ml of Mo NPs relative to control cells in 24 h. End-point data clearly suggest that Mo NPs significantly protected cells against cytotoxicity induced by H2O2 and ZnO (NPs) (p<0.05). Our study warrants further investigation about Mo NPs that could be exploited in myriads of nanotechnology applications.

New perspectives on the neurodevelopmental effects of SSRIs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely prescribed for the treatment of depression and anxiety-related disorders. These drugs target the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) and increase serotonin signalling. Although chronic SSRI administration has few reported side effects, recent observations suggest that it could have long-term effects on neurodevelopment. First, 5-HTT is transiently expressed in many brain areas during development. Second, 5-HTT blockade during development causes wiring defects in these areas. These effects are seen most clearly in the sensory systems. Third, the behavioural effects of 5-HTT blockade during development are sometimes dramatically different from the effects of 5-HTT blockade during adulthood. Most of this evidence was collected from studies with 5-HTT knockout mice and rats. However, the phenotypes associated with low or high functioning 5-HTT alleles in humans can result from similar developmental alterations in 5-HT levels. Here, we review the existing evidence on the long-term effects of developmental SSRI exposure.

[The BK virus load in urine in association with the development of hemorrhagic cystitis after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]. To analyze the relationship between BK viruria and the late onset hemorrhagic cystitis (LOHC) after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), and investigate the role of BK virus load in the development of LOHC. From August 2006 to April 2008, urine samples were collected weekly from 113 patients undergoing HSCT. Virus DNA were extracted from the urine samples and amplified by qualitative PCR. Real-time quantitative PCR was used to quantify BKV DNA in the urine samples of all BK viruria patients. LOHC occurred in 22 patients (19.5%), including grade 1 in 7, grade 2 in 11, grade 3 in 3, and grade 4 in one. The median onset time was 44 (13 - 114) days after transplantation. Twenty-one of which (95.5%) were BK virus positive, being significantly higher than that in non-LOHC patients (31.9%) (P = 0.000). No BK virus was detected in the healthy control group at the same time. Quantitative PCR detection showed that the mean BK virus DNA copies in LOHC patients at a week before occurring HC was higher than that at the first positive samples (10(5) copies/microl versus 10(4) copies/microl, P = 0.025), and it was no significant change at the onset and a week after HC. Meanwhile, there was no statistical difference in the mean level of BK virus DNA copies among the LOHC patients with different grades. The mean level of BK virus DNA copies in non-HC patients was 10(3) to 10(4) copies/microl, being lower than that in LOHC patients. BK viruria is an important pathogenic cause of the LOHC after HSCT. The occurrence of BKV viruria in HSCT patients, together with the increasing of BK virus DNA copies in urine, over the level of 10(5) copies/microl may indicate a possible development of LOHC.

Tumour response and secondary resectability of colorectal liver metastases following neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cetuximab: the CELIM randomised phase 2 trial. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for unresectable colorectal liver metastases can downsize tumours for curative resection. We assessed the effectiveness of cetuximab combined with chemotherapy in this setting. Between Dec 2, 2004, and March 27, 2008, 114 patients were enrolled from 17 centres in Germany and Austria; three patients receiving FOLFOX6 alone were excluded from the analysis. Patients with non-resectable liver metastases (technically non-resectable or > or =5 metastases) were randomly assigned to receive cetuximab with either FOLFOX6 (oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and folinic acid; group A) or FOLFIRI (irinotecan, fluorouracil, and folinic acid; group B). Randomisation was not blinded, and was stratified by technical resectability and number of metastases, use of PET staging, and EGFR expression status. They were assessed for response every 8 weeks by CT or MRI. A local multidisciplinary team reassessed resectability after 16 weeks, and then every 2 months up to 2 years. Patients with resectable disease were offered liver surgery within 4-6 weeks of the last treatment cycle. The primary endpoint was tumour response assessed by Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST), analysed by modified intention to treat. A retrospective, blinded surgical review of patients with radiological images at both baseline and during treatment was done to assess objectively any changes in resectability. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00153998. 56 patients were randomly assigned to group A and 55 to group B. One patient in each group were excluded from the analysis of the primary endpoint because they discontinued treatment before first full dose, one patient in group B was excluded because of early pulmonary embolism. A confirmed partial or complete response was noted in 36 (68%) of 53 patients in group A, and 30 (57%) of 53 patients in group B (difference 11%, 95% CI -8 to 30; odds ratio [OR] 1.62, 0.74-3.59; p=0.23). The most frequent grade 3 and 4 toxicities were skin toxicity (15 of 54 patients in group A, and 22 of 55 patients in group B), and neutropenia (13 of 54 patients in group A and 12 of 55 patients in group B). R0 resection was done in 20 (38%) of 53 patients in group A and 16 (30%) of 53 of patients in group B. In a retrospective analysis of response by KRAS status, a partial or complete response was noted in 47 (70%) of 67 patients with KRAS wild-type tumours versus 11 (41%) of 27 patients with KRAS-mutated tumours (OR 3.42, 1.35-8.66; p=0.0080). According to the retrospective review, resectability rates increased from 32% (22 of 68 patients) at baseline to 60% (41 of 68) after chemotherapy (p<0.0001). Chemotherapy with cetuximab yields high response rates compared with historical controls, and leads to significantly increased resectability. Merck-Serono, Sanofi-Aventis, and Pfizer.

Adopted technologies and basis for selection at municipal solid waste landfill facilities constructed in recent years in Japan. In Japan, as the construction of new landfill facilities has become extremely difficult and the number of sites procured for landfill construction has decreased due to the 'not in my back yard' (NIMBY) syndrome, it has been assumed that the adoption of new technologies has increased. As the performance of new technologies exceeds that of conventional technologies, it is also assumed that residents would prefer the use of these new technologies and therefore any construction plans should be devised to ensure their use to ensure residents' satisfaction. In the present study, the technologies adopted for municipal solid waste landfill facilities constructed in recent years (2000 to 2004) in Japan and the bases for their adoption were investigated by means of a questionnaire survey. One of the main bases for the adoption of new technologies was the request by residents for new technology for roofing, rather than the other for new technologies for barrier systems, leachate treatment, and monitoring. In addition, it is possible that the municipalities did not recognize the difference between conventional and new technologies as defined in this study. The roof-type landfill that isolates waste from the surrounding environment was one of the requirements for the construction of new landfill facilities identified in the present investigation, and in this regard waste isolation should be required in all circumstances.

Learning effects in the block design task: a stimulus parameter-based approach. Learning effects were assessed for the block design (BD) task, on the basis of variation in 2 stimulus parameters: perceptual cohesiveness (PC) and set size uncertainty (U). Thirty-one nonclinical undergraduate students (19 female) each completed 3 designs for each of 4 varied sets of the stimulus parameters (high-PC/high-U, high-PC/low-U, low-PC/high-U, and low-PC/low-U), ordered randomly within a larger set of designs with mixed stimulus characteristics. Regression analyses revealed significant, although modest, learning effects in all conditions. Negative-logarithmic learning slopes (growth factors) were greatest for high-U/high-PC designs and smallest for low-U/low-PC designs. Comparison of these slopes with known Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (3rd ed.; D. Wechsler, 1997; and 4th ed.; D. Wechsler, 2008) BD subtest gain scores demonstrated that presenting novel test items matched on stimulus parameters in multiple administrations reduced learning effects compared with the repeated use of the same test items. The results suggest that repeated administration of novel test items of the BD subtest, matched for PC and U, would result in more accurate assessments of changes in examinees' abilities over time than would the use of the same items. Difficulties inherent in implementing this method are also discussed.


European wild boars and domestic pigs display different polymorphic patterns in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 1, TLR2, and TLR6 genes.

Immunostimulants for malignant gliomas. Several immunostimulant approaches have been studied in the treatment of gliomas. The advent of recombinant DNA technology led to a nonspecific immunostimulation via systemic administration of cytokines. Recently, in attempts to more closely mimic their natural activity, cytokines have been delivered by implanting genetically transduced cells or by using in vivo gene transfer techniques. The latest efforts have focused on immunostimulatory agents that act directly on antigen-presenting cells and effector cells of the immune system via pattern recognition receptors. Combining these strategies with more than one mode of immunotherapy may provide better clinical results.

Paired crossover study of two plateletpheresis systems concerning platelet product quality and donor comfort. Two plateletpheresis cell separator systems were compared in a paired crossover study with respect to the product quality, the number of platelet (PLT) units per donation, and the donor comfort. Forty-four female and 47 male donors were distributed to three body weight groups. Double PLT units with 6 x 10(11) PLTs were collected from three Fenwal Amicus Crescendo (AC) and three CaridianBCT Trima Accel (TA) machines. Each donor made one donation on each randomly assigned system and answered a questionnaire on the subjective donor comfort. The answers were scored from 5 (best) to 1 (worst). Based on 182 donations, with 91 donations on AC and TA separators each, 179 runs resulted in double PLT units and three (2xAC, 1xTA) in single units. The white blood cell counts were below 1 x 10(6) in all but eight therapeutic units (8xTA; mean, 1.98 x 10(6)). The mean PLT yield (AC 6.00 x 10(11), TA 5.98 x 10(11)), the collection rate, and the PLT extraction coefficient did not significantly differ between the two devices. Differences of the donor comfort over all groups were only observed for the loudness of the instrument (4.63 AC vs. 4.24 TA, p < 0.001) and the subjective impression of the run time (4.24 AC vs. 4.48 TA, p < 0.05). Male donors greater than 88 kg preferred the TA instruments concerning the impact of the needle, run time, overall experience (p < 0.01 each), and willingness to donate on the same instrument again (p < 0.05). Only minor differences were observed despite the fact that the AC separators are run with two needles and the TA with one needle.

Distinct patterns of cytokine and angiogenic factor modulation and markers of benefit for vandetanib and/or chemotherapy in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. There is an unmet need for biomarkers for identifying patients likely to benefit from anticancer treatments, selecting dose, and understanding mechanisms of resistance. Plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and soluble VEGF receptor 2 (sVEGFR-2) are known to be modulated by VEGF pathway inhibitors. It is unknown whether chemotherapy or VEGFR inhibitor/chemotherapy combinations induce changes in these or other cytokines and angiogenic factors (CAFs) and whether such changes could be markers of benefit. Thirty-five plasma CAFs were analyzed using multiplexed bead arrays and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays from 123 patients with non-small-cell lung cancer in a randomized phase II study who received vandetanib, a VEGFR and epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, monotherapy carboplatin and paclitaxel (CP), or the combination (VCP). Changes in CAFs at days 8, 22, and 43 from baseline were correlated with progression risk. VEGF increased and sVEGFR-2 decreased by day 43 in the vandetanib arm, whereas a distinct pattern was observed in the CP and VCP arms, with significant decreases in interleukin (IL) -12, IL-1 receptor antagonist, and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) and increased macrophage chemoattractant protein 1. In each treatment arm, changes in different markers were associated with progression risk. For example, increases in IL-8 with VCP, MMP-9 with CP, and VEGF with vandetanib monotherapy were associated with increased progression risk, and increase in intercellular adhesion molecule 1 with vandetanib was associated with decreased risk. Vandetanib and chemotherapy treatment led to distinct patterns of CAF changes; the combination resembled chemotherapy alone. Changes in specific CAFs correlated with clinical outcome, but markers differed for each treatment arm. CAF profiling may provide insights into the biologic effects of treatment and identify drug-specific markers of activity and clinical benefit.

A biomechanical comparison of a tendon repair device and 4 stranded, cruciate repair sutures for flexor tendon ruptured. To compare the biomechanical properties of the single strand monofilament Nylon 2-0 Khon Kaen tendon repair device for flexor tendon repair and standard 4-stranded cruciate repair sutures. 80 flexor digitorum longus tendons from fresh cadavers, were cut and sutured by Khon Kaen tendon repair device (core nylon) or 4-stranded, cruciate repair (3-0 monofilament nylon) and both groups were divided into two groups; the first group combined with 5-0 monofilament nylon circumferential epitendinous suture and the second group without epitendinous suture. The sutured tendons were tested by using biomechanical testing machine (LLOYD instruments, LR30K), in rate 5 mm/s. Force, stiffness and energy absorbed at peak force (calculated from the force-displacement curves) and mode of failure were compared The Khon Kaen tendon repair device (core nylon) without epitendinous sutured group has 2 mm gap force, peak force and stiffness significantly lower than standard 4-stranded, cruciate repair; but with no statistical difference in the epitendinous sutured group; 90% of Khon Kaen tendon repair device failed by suture breakage and 10% failed by ankle pullout. Although the strength of Khon Kaen tendon repair device (core nylon) alone is lower than the strength of 4-stranded, cruciate repair, and 90% mode of failure was core suture breakage, the authors recommended to change core suture from nylon to a stiffer material and re-inforced with epitendinous suture.

The effect of an anaesthetic patient information video on perioperative anxiety: A randomised study. Despite growing evidence that an educational anaesthesia video can effectively reduce perioperative anxiety, the ideal medium for addressing perioperative anxiety is unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of viewing an anaesthetic patient information video on anxiety levels in patients scheduled to undergo surgery. A randomised controlled trial. Pingtung Christian Hospital (PTCH), Taiwan. One hundred patients were randomised to either an experimental group (nâ=â50) or a control group (nâ=â50). At the preoperative clinic, the experimental group watched the an 8 minute educational anaesthetic video, whereas the control group received a standard 8-min verbal briefing on anaesthesia after preoperative assessment. The Chinese version of the Spielberger state trait anxiety inventory, which included a state scale (STAI-S) and a trait scale (STAI-T), was performed in the preoperative clinic (T1) before anaesthetic preassessment, at the preoperative holding area just before surgery (T2) and again on the third day after surgery (T3). Scores for overall satisfaction with medical care were obtained on the third day after surgery. For two time interval comparisons, effect size was used to standardise the extent of change as measured by STAI-S. After the educational intervention, state anxiety was lower in the experimental group than in the control group at both T2 (42.9âÂ±â6.5 vs. 45.0âÂ±â12.7) and T3 (40.2âÂ±â5.3 vs. 48.8âÂ±â8.5). Compared with control group, the experimental group had a larger effect size at T2 and T3 (-0.65 and -0.36, respectively). Overall satisfaction was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group (Pâ<â0.05). Perioperative anxiety was significantly reduced and overall patient satisfaction increased after viewing a preoperative educational anaesthesia video compared with a standard verbal briefing on anaesthesia.

Renin-angiotensin system activation in renal adipogenesis. The kidney is one of the major organs involved in whole-body homeostasis while chronic renal impairment usually leads to fat redistribution and hyperlipidemia. The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of tissue renal renin-angiotensin system (RAS) components, lipogenic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), and cytokine TNF-alpha in the development of ectopic adipogenesis and lipid deposition. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into three groups: untreated uninephrectomized (UNX) rats, UNX rats treated with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), lisinopril, and sham-operated rats. All animals were euthanized at 10 mo postoperation. The untreated UNX rats showed increased protein expression of renin, angiotensinogen, PPARgamma, and the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) but reduced protein expression of AT1R and TNF-alpha in their remnant kidneys. Immunofluorescence staining revealed increased reactivity of angiotensinogen and angiotensin I/II in renal tubular cells and adipocytes of the untreated UNX rats. ACEI treatment largely prevented these disorders in association with restored normolipidemia and normalized renal adipogenesis and lipid deposition. These findings support the notion that tissue RAS, PPARgamma, and TNF-alpha collectively play an important role in the renal adipogenesis and lipid metabolism.

Biology of maize kernel infection by Fusarium verticillioides. Fusarium kernel rot disease starburst symptomatology was characterized fully for the first time. Two maize lines were hand pollinated and inoculated, using a fluorescent protein-expressing transformant of the fungal pathogen Fusarium verticillioides, by introduction of a conidial suspension through the silk channel of intact ears. Microscopy was used to identify the infection court and document initial stages of kernel colonization and subsequent manifestation of macroscopic symptoms. The fungus entered kernels of susceptible line AD38 via an open stylar canal and spread extracellularly and over the kernel through the nucellus region, sporadically entering pericarp and filling the long thick-walled mesocarp cells. Hyphae spread within pericarp from cell to cell via pits, colonizing files of host cells by growing both up and down the kernel in a radial pattern that preceded macroscopic symptom development. The starburst symptom developed subsequently, and mirrored colonization exactly, when there was extensive dissolution of the thick walls of pericarp cells. Line HT1 exhibited a closed stylar canal phenotype and was not susceptible-except when the pericarp surface was breached mechanically. We hypothesize the passive movement of conidia along the surface of silks, perhaps via capillarity, as a possible mechanism for pathogen access to the infection court.

The behavior of PLGA microspheres containing rifampicin in alveolar macrophages. We have developed a pulmonary drug delivery system for the treatment of tuberculosis using rifampicin (RFP) encapsulated in poly-(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres (RFP-PLGA MS), which is a biocompatible polymer. In this study, the behavior of RFP-PLGA MS and the metabolism of RFP were investigated after their uptake by macrophages using the rat alveolar macrophage cell line, NR8383. The prepared RFP-PLGA MS were spherical with an average diameter of 1.9microm and were taken up effectively by NR8383 cells in an energy-dependent manner. It was shown by fluorescent microscopic studies that the RPF-PLGA MS taken up by the cells were localized in phago-lysosomes and then degraded. Although a small amount of 3-formylrifamycin SV (3-FRSV) was generated by the metabolism of RFP, almost all RFP remained unchanged. It was considered, therefore, that RFP was released into the cytosol with drug potency intact. Based on these results, RFP-PLGA MS will be effective for the delivery of anti-tuberculosis drugs such as RFP, and will be a potentially useful drug delivery tool for pulmonary and possibly other tissues as well.

Alagille syndrome and liver transplantation. Alagille syndrome is a multisystem disorder in which progressive liver disease with persistent cholestasis and dramatic pruritus often warrant consideration for liver transplantation. The most important part of the transplant assessment is evaluation of the cardiac and renal involvement. Preoperatively, cardiac performance often must be tested with dynamic stress tests, mimicking hemodynamic changes during liver transplant. Many aspects of the syndrome including cholestasis, pruritus, and hypercholesterolemia improve posttransplant, but short stature is rarely significantly affected. One- and 5-year patient and graft survival after liver transplant is comparable to other elective indications, but effects of long-term immunosuppressants on evolution of other components of the syndrome, including vascular, bone, and renal disease, remain largely unknown.

Impact of patient adherence and test performance on the cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening in developing countries: the case of Honduras. We examined the impact of patient adherence and screening test performance on the cost-effectiveness of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and Pap smears when used with colposcopy for diagnosis. Cost-effectiveness analysis was performed using computer modeling. The primary outcome was cancer prevalence in the 10 years after screening. Three hypothetical populations of 35-year-old women were compared: never-screened women, women screened with VIA, and women screened with Pap smears. We used community-based data from our screening program in Honduras to estimate screening test sensitivity and specificity, adherence to follow-up, and costs of screening and colposcopy services. Published data were used to model disease outcomes. VIA was more sensitive than Pap smears (70% vs. 4%), less expensive (U.S. 0.23 dollars vs. 3.17 dollars), and the 2-vist VIA system had a higher rate of adherence to follow-up than the 3-visit Pap smear system (84% vs. 38%). VIA had a higher false-positive rate than Pap smears resulting in higher colposcopy referral rates, but more dysplasia was detected and treated. Cost-effectiveness analysis revealed that screening with VIA would cost U.S. 3,198 dollars per cancer case avoided and reduce cancer cases by 42%, versus U.S. 36,802 dollars and 2% for Pap screening. Although Pap smear quality was low in Honduras, sensitivity analysis showed that VIA was more cost-effective than Pap smears, even when test accuracy was equivalent. In developing countries, systems barriers can limit the cost-effectiveness of Pap smears. VIA may be a cost-effective alternative for some resource-poor settings, although systems barriers, quality control, and feasibility issues must be considered.

Bone Cell-autonomous Contribution of Type 2 Cannabinoid Receptor to Breast Cancer-induced Osteolysis. The cannabinoid type 2 receptor (CB2) has previously been implicated as a regulator of tumor growth, bone remodeling, and bone pain. However, very little is known about the role of the skeletal CB2 receptor in the regulation of osteoblasts and osteoclasts changes associated with breast cancer. Here we found that the CB2-selective agonists HU308 and JWH133 reduced the viability of a variety of parental and bone-tropic human and mouse breast cancer cells at high micromolar concentrations. Under conditions in which these ligands are used at the nanomolar range, HU308 and JWH133 enhanced human and mouse breast cancer cell-induced osteoclastogenesis and exacerbated osteolysis, and these effects were attenuated in cultures obtained from CB2-deficient mice or in the presence of a CB2 receptor blocker. HU308 and JWH133 had no effects on osteoblast growth or differentiation in the presence of conditioned medium from breast cancer cells, but under these circumstances both agents enhanced parathyroid hormone-induced osteoblast differentiation and the ability to support osteoclast formation. Mechanistic studies in osteoclast precursors and osteoblasts showed that JWH133 and HU308 induced PI3K/AKT activity in a CB2-dependent manner, and these effects were enhanced in the presence of osteolytic and osteoblastic factors such as RANKL (receptor activator of NFÎºB ligand) and parathyroid hormone. When combined with published work, these findings suggest that breast cancer and bone cells exhibit differential responses to treatment with CB2 ligands depending upon cell type and concentration used. We, therefore, conclude that both CB2-selective activation and antagonism have potential efficacy in cancer-associated bone disease, but further studies are warranted and ongoing.

[Risk factors associated with increased end points of patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes in China: 2 years follow up results of China-OASIS Registry]. To identify the risk factors associated with increased combined end points (including death, new myocardial infarction and stroke) of patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome in China. Patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome hospitalized in 38 hospitals in China were included in this registry study as part of an international multicentre registry-OASIS. Data including clinical characteristics, previous medical history, therapeutic procedure and follow-up medicines, were collected and analyzed. The follow up period was two years. Cox regression model was used to analyze the association between multiple risk factors and combined end points. From April 1999 to December 2001, 2294 eligible patients were enrolled nationwide and 2294 patients finished the 2 years follow up (mean age: 62.8 +/- 8.3 years and 62.3% males). The mortality was 7.6% (174/2294), 168 new myocardial infarction and 93 stroke were recorded during follow up and the combined end point events was 365 (15.9%) at the end of the two year's follow-up. Forty-eight factors were analyzed by Cox regression model to determine the impact of these factors on the occurrence of end point event. Risk factors that promoting end points were: thrombolysis during hospitalization, heart rate more than 120 bpm at admission, current smoker, history of PTCA, length of the first hospitalization, intravenous nitrate use during hospitalization, history of heart failure, low molecular weight heparin or subcutaneous heparin use during hospitalization, former smoker, calcium antagonist use during hospitalization, history of hypertension or coronary artery disease, recurrent angina pectoris during hospitalization and age by the first hospitalization. Protective factors that reducing end point were: normal ECG at admission, use of oral nitrate, anti-platelet medicine, calcium antagonist, lipid lowering agents and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor during follow-up period. The two-years incidence of combined endpoints of death, new myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndromes is 15.9% in China. Fifteen factors are associated with increased and 8 factors (mostly related to regular medication use) are associated with reduced occurrence of endpoints during follow up in this cohort.

[Children exposed to multidrug-resistant tuberculosis: How should we manage? Analysis of 46 child contacts and review of the literature]. Tuberculosis-related morbidity and mortality remain important. Emergence and diffusion of multidrug-resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a global public health concern. Cases of MDR-TB in children are a sentinel event indicating the spread of a mycobacterial strain within a community. Latent TB precedes MDR-TB and screening and follow-up of contact individuals are key points of TB infection control. We performed the case-investigation of 20 adult cases of MDR-TB managed in our institution. Forty-six pediatric contact individuals were identified. A high proportion of these children were lost to follow-up (80% at 12 months), showing that monitoring this reservoir population with migrant history is challenging. Five (11%) children presented a secondary infection: one child was diagnosed with active TB infection (positive tuberculin skin test associated with abnormalities on chest computer tomography [CT] scan). Four children were diagnosed with latent TB infection (isolated positive tuberculin skin test with normal CT scan). Two of these children received a treatment adjusted to the strain of the index case. In the setting of emerging MDR-TB, tuberculin skin test may be likely replaced by specific interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA), independent of prior BCG vaccination. In addition, chest CT scan is preferred to chest X-ray to detect TB lesions. The management of latent TB infection is controversial: immediate treatment with second-line anti-TB drugs adapted to the index case strain or, consistently with WHO guidelines, a simple follow-up with subsequent treatment in case of active TB.

Relationships among symptom severity, coping styles, and quality of life in community-dwelling women with urinary incontinence: a multiple mediator model. To investigate the relationships among symptom severity, coping styles, and quality of life (QOL) in community-dwelling women with urinary incontinence (UI). A total of 592 women with UI participated in this cross-sectional study. Bivariate Pearson's correlation was used to examine the correlations between symptom severity, coping styles, and QOL. Multivariate regression models and Sobel tests were used to test the mediating effect of coping styles. Additionally, a multiple mediator model was used to examine the mediating role of coping styles collectively. All regression models were adjusted for age, education, marital status, income, duration of UI, and type of UI. Participants tended to use avoidant and palliative coping styles and not use instrumental coping style. Avoidant and palliative coping styles were associated with poor QOL, and partially mediated the association between symptom severity and QOL. Nearly 73% of the adverse effect of symptom severity on QOL was mediated by avoidant and palliative coping styles. The use of avoidant and palliative coping styles was higher with more severe urine leakage, and QOL tended to be poorer. Coping styles should be addressed in UI management. It may be of particular value to look closely at negative coping styles and implement education and training of patients in improving their coping skills related to managing UI, which will in turn improve their QOL.

Rapid EEG desynchronization and EMG activation induced by intravenous cocaine in freely moving rats: a peripheral, nondopamine neural triggering. Many important physiological, behavioral, and psychoemotional effects of intravenous (IV) cocaine (COC) are too fast and transient compared with pharmacokinetic predictions, suggesting a possible involvement of peripheral neural mechanisms in their triggering. In the present study, we examined changes in cortical electroencephalogram (EEG) and neck electromyogram (EMG) induced in freely moving rats by IV COC administration at low, reinforcing doses (0.25-1.0 mg/kg) and compared them with those induced by an auditory stimulus and IV COC methiodide, which cannot cross the blood-brain barrier. We found that COC induces rapid, strong, and prolonged EEG desynchronization, associated with decrease in alpha and increase in beta and gamma activities, and EMG activation and that both begin within 2-6 s following the start of a 10-s injection; immediate components of this effect were dose independent. The rapid COC-induced changes in EEG and EMG resembled those induced by an auditory stimulus; the latter effects had shorter onset latencies and durations and were fully blocked during urethane anesthesia. Although urethane anesthesia completely blocked COC-induced EMG activation and rapid components of EEG response, COC still induced EEG desynchronization that was much weaker, greatly delayed (approximately 60 s), and associated with tonic decreases in delta and increases in alpha, beta, and gamma activities. Surprisingly, IV saline delivered during slow-wave sleep (but not quite wakefulness) also induced a transient EEG desynchronization but without changes in EMG activity; these effects were also fully blocked during anesthesia. Peripherally acting COC methiodide fully mimicked rapid EEG and EMG effects of regular COC, but the effects at an equimolar dose were less prolonged than those with regular COC. These data suggest that in awake animals IV COC, like somato-sensory stimuli, induces cortical activation and a subsequent motor response via its action on peripheral neural elements and involving rapid neural transmission. By providing a rapid neural signal and triggering transient neural activation, such an action might play a crucial role in the sensory effects of COC, thus contributing to the learning and development of drug-taking behavior.

Utilization and perioperative complications of laparoscopic cryoablation vs. robotic partial nephrectomy for localized renal tumors. To compare the utilization, perioperative complications and predictors of LCA versus RPN in the treatment of localized renal tumors. From the Nationwide Inpatient Sample we identified patients undergoing RPN or LCA for the treatment of localized renal tumors from October 2008 through 2010. Patient and hospital-specific factors which predict postoperative complications and use of LCA were investigated. 14,275 patients with localized renal tumors were identified: 70.3% had RPN and 29.7% had LCA. LCA was more common in older patient and at hospitals without robotic consoles. No difference was identified in perioperative complications (0.2% vs. 0.2%), transfusion (5.1% vs. 6.2%), length of stay (2.9 vs. 3.0 days) or median cost ($41,753 vs. $44,618) between the groups, LCA vs. RPN. On multivariate analysis sicker patients were more likely to have LCA (OR 1.34, p=0.048) and sicker patients had greater postoperative complications (OR 3.30, p<0.001); LCA did not predict more complications (OR 1.63, p=0.138) and LCA was performed at hospitals without RCs (OR 0.02, p<0.001). Limitations include observational study design, inability to assess disease severity, operative time, or body mass index, which may affect patient selection and outcomes. More patients had RPN vs. LCA; surgical technique was not predictive of postoperative complications. As technology develops to treat localized renal tumors, it will be important to continue to track outcomes and costs for procedures including RPN and LCA.

[Significance and mechanism of MSCT perfusion scan on differentiation of NSCLC]. To determine the significance of MSCT perfusion scan on differentiation of NSCLC and to investigate its possible mechanisms. Forty four NSCLC patients underwent CT perfusion scan by MSCT. Among them, 22 cases were selected to detected the two-dimensional tumor microvascular architecture phenotype (2D-TMAP), the relationships between CT perfusion parameters (BF, BV, PEI, TIP), and the differentiation of NSCLC were analysed by using the correlation analysis and trend test. Spearman correlation analysis was used to study the relationships between CT perfusion parameters, differentiation, and 2D-TMAP. The total BF, BV and PEI decreased with decreasing differentiation of NSCLC (P<0.05). The total PEI showed a positive correlation with the total MVD (P<0.05). There were negative correlations between the surrounding area BF, the total BF, BV, and PEI, the uncomplete lumen of the surrounding area MVD, and expression of PCNA, respectively (P<0.05). There were positive correlations between degree of differentiation and the uncomplete lumen of the surrounding area MVD (P<0.05). It was the same as degree of differentiation and expression of PCNA, VEGF, respectively. There were positive correlations between the uncomplete lumen of the surrounding area MVD and expression of VEGF, ephrinB2, EphB4, and PCNA, respectively (P<0.05). Perfusion parameters reflect the difference of density of vassels with mature functional lumen. Careful evaluation of the differences of blood flow pattern in pulmonary space-occupying lesions by MSCT perfusion scan can be used to identify the degree of NSCLC differentiation.

Identifying cancer patients at risk for cardiotoxicity. Improvements in therapies have significantly changed survival of cancer patients. However, the clinical history and oncologic treatment put cancer patients at higher risk for developing cardiovascular problems. Anthracyclines, but also the targeted therapy and angiogenesis inhibitors, are all treatments associated with cardiotoxicity. The most common adverse event is a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction that may progress to overt heart failure. Recognition of a cardiac impairment during or after a potential cardiotoxic treatment requires a stringent assessment of clinical symptoms and signs of heart failure associated with an evaluation of the left ventricular ejection fraction, which, however, detects the damage already installed. Circulating cardiac biomarkers are promising in detecting cardiotoxicity and will likely change the approach for identifying patients at risk. 

Livelihood strategies and nutritional status of grandparent caregivers of AIDS orphans in Nyando District, Kenya. Although the growing role of grandparents as primary caregivers of AIDS orphans in sub-Saharan Africa has been established by previous research, few scholars have undertaken studies to explore the experiences of older persons in this new role. In this study, I used qualitative research methods to examine livelihood strategies that influenced the nutritional status of grandparent caregivers, a population largely neglected in the literature on African livelihoods. In this article I highlight the agency of older persons by identifying responses that promote their livelihood resilience. My research was guided by the sustainable livelihoods framework and involved in-depth individual interviews with 30 grandparent caregivers selected based on their nutritional status. Focus group discussions and key informant interviews were also conducted. Results indicate that the ability to mobilize new sources of labor for food production and new social networks to facilitate other forms of food entitlement are critical to nutritional status. These results are important in designing interventions targeting vulnerable grandparent caregivers.

Impact of using different guideline recommended serum natriuretic peptide thresholds on the diagnosis and referral rates of a diagnostic heart failure clinic. The aims of this study were to determine the diagnostic yield of a dedicated heart failure diagnosis clinic and the impact of using different guideline recommended N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) referral thresholds on diagnosis and referral patterns. Patients referred by primary care between September 2011 and May 2013 were included in the analysis. Data collected included baseline characteristics, NT-proBNP levels, echocardiographic and clinical findings, final diagnosis and outcome. The impact of using Newcastle (locally modified age-adjusted NT-proBNP thresholds), National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and European Society of Cardiology (ESC) NT-proBNP thresholds on diagnosis and referrals was determined by applying the different guidelines to this population. A total of 208 patients were referred; median age 77.5 years and 62.5% were women. Thirty-four patients (16.3%) had systolic heart failure, 50 patients (24.0%) had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. One hundred and six patients (51.0%) did not have heart failure. Using NICE guidelines (NT-proBNP â¥ 400 ng/l) instead of the Newcastle age-adjusted NT-proBNP referral thresholds results in 59 fewer referrals, but eight heart failure diagnoses were missed. Using the ESC cut-off of NT-proBNP â¥ 125 ng/l would result in 88 additional referrals; one diagnosis of heart failure would be missed. Over a mean follow-up of 16.8 Â± 6 months there were 21 deaths and 47 hospital admissions. The Newcastle age-adjusted thresholds led to more referrals in comparison to NICE guidelines but are more sensitive in diagnosing heart failure. Using ESC recommended thresholds results in a similar diagnostic yield to our age-adjusted thresholds, but has the potential to significantly increase the referrals in patients â¥ 75 years, which may result in a lower diagnostic yield.

Solid phase synthesis of 2-aminobenzothiazoles. A traceless solid supported protocol for the synthesis of 2-aminobenzothiazoles is described, employing resin-bound acyl-isothiocyanate and a series of anilines. Cyclization of the resulting N-acyl, N'-phenyl-thioureas generates the 2-aminobenzothiazole scaffold, which can be further elaborated prior to hydrazine-mediated cleavage of the final products from the carboxy-polystyrene resin. A small, focused library of 2-aminobenzothiazoles was prepared.

The transcriptional transactivator Tat selectively regulates viral splicing. HIV-1 gene expression requires both viral and cellular factors to control and coordinate transcription. While the viral factor Tat is known for its transcriptional transactivator properties, we present evidence for an unexpected function of Tat in viral splicing regulation. We used a series of HIV-1 reporter minigenes to demonstrate that Tat's role in splicing is dependent on the cellular co-transcriptional splicing activators Tat-SF1 and CA150. Surprisingly, we show that this Tat-mediated splicing function is independent from transcriptional activation. In the context of the full-length viral genome, this mechanism promotes an autoregulatory feedback that decreases expression of tat and favors expression of the env-specific mRNA. Our data demonstrate that Tat-mediated regulation of transcription and splicing can be uncoupled and suggest a mechanism for the involvement of specific transcriptional activators in splicing.

Quasi-experimental evidence on the causal effects of physical health on mental health. While a large body of literature has demonstrated an association between physical health problems and psychiatric ones, the extent to which one is causally linked to the other remains difficult to estimate. This quasi-experimental study seeks to (i) estimate causal effects of an acute negative health event (health shock) on mental health and (ii) examine the role of debt and disability as potential mediators. The study design employs exogenous injuries in bus accidents together with a matching procedure to simulate a random exposure to physical health shock. The study was conducted among travellers on state-owned buses in Karnataka, India. Exposure occurred between July and December 2005. Outcomes were assessed from a household survey conducted in November-December 2006. Eighty-four injured passengers identified from bus accident compensation records were interviewed along with 336 unexposed individuals enrolled from passengers on the same accident bus routes, matched on age group, gender and village/neighbourhood of residence. The main outcome of Psychological Distress was measured using the Kessler-10 scale. Exposure to the health shock increases psychological distress by 1.5 standard deviations (SD) 1 year later (P < 0.01). Physical disability is a key mediating mechanism, accounting for 65% of the observed effect. After controlling for disability, odds of having distress levels commensurate with moderate/severe mental illness was 3.01 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26-7.19]. Indebtedness resulting from the health shock did not mediate the association between shock and distress. Evidence from this quasi-experimental study supports the hypothesis that acute physical health shocks can cause long-term mental health problems.

The horizontal curvature of point-to-point movements does not depend on simply the planning space. Point-to-point movements constrained to the horizontal plane are generally straight, although they exhibit slight deviations from straightness. Unconstrained horizontal movements (i.e., movements where the hand is lifted) are more curved in their projection onto the horizontal plane than constrained movements. It has been argued that this difference in horizontal curvature is due to differences in the space in which the movements were planned (joint space versus work space, respectively). The current study challenged this explanation. We found that horizontal curvature of constrained movements increased when moving over a round surface compared to moving over a flat surface and when friction was low compared to when friction was high. Because all these movements were constrained movements this suggests that the earlier reported differences in horizontal curvature between constrained and unconstrained movements may not originate from a difference in the movements' planning space. The discussion addresses how factors related to planning and factors related to biomechanics may contribute to the magnitude of horizontal curvature in unconstrained and constrained movements.

Serum thyroid hormone profile in critically Ill children. To study thyroid hormone profile in critically ill children and its correlation to disease severity and clinical outcome. Total serum triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4) and TSH were estimated at admission and discharge from PICU/ just before death. Mean T3 levels in cases were significantly lower than controls and lower in patients who expired, both at admission and just prior to death. Mean T4 levels were lower in cases, and just prior to death. Mean TSH levels were not different in cases and controls; or in survived and expired cases. When both T3 and T4 are low, mortality risk increases 30 times. Serum T3, T4 and TSH values improved in patients who survived unlike in those who expired. Age, sex, duration of hospital stay, ventilation, inotropic support, and PICU stay did not show any correlation with patient outcome or thyroid hormone profile. PRISM score at 24 hours and T4 levels in the second sample were significant predictors of survival. T3 levels reflect the patient's clinical status, T4 levels can predict survival.

CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing in Leishmania donovani. The prokaryotic CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas9, an RNA-guided endonuclease, has been shown to mediate efficient genome editing in a wide variety of organisms. In the present study, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been adapted to Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite that causes fatal human visceral leishmaniasis. We introduced the Cas9 nuclease into L. donovani and generated guide RNA (gRNA) expression vectors by using the L. donovani rRNA promoter and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme. It is demonstrated within that L. donovani mainly used homology-directed repair (HDR) and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) to repair the Cas9 nuclease-created double-strand DNA break (DSB). The nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway appears to be absent in L. donovani. With this CRISPR-Cas9 system, it was possible to generate knockouts without selection by insertion of an oligonucleotide donor with stop codons and 25-nucleotide homology arms into the Cas9 cleavage site. Likewise, we disrupted and precisely tagged endogenous genes by inserting a bleomycin drug selection marker and GFP gene into the Cas9 cleavage site. With the use of Hammerhead and HDV ribozymes, a double-gRNA expression vector that further improved gene-targeting efficiency was developed, and it was used to make precise deletion of the 3-kb miltefosine transporter gene (LdMT). In addition, this study identified a novel single point mutation caused by CRISPR-Cas9 in LdMT (M381T) that led to miltefosine resistance, a concern for the only available oral antileishmanial drug. Together, these results demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas9 system represents an effective genome engineering tool for L. donovani. Leishmania donovani is the causative agent of fatal visceral leishmaniasis. To understand Leishmania infection and pathogenesis and identify new drug targets for control of leishmaniasis, more-efficient ways to manipulate this parasite genome are required. In this study, we have implemented CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing technology in L. donovani. Both single- and dual-gRNA expression vectors were developed using a strong RNA polymerase I promoter and ribozymes. With this system, it was possible to generate loss-of-function insertion and deletion mutations and introduce drug selection markers and the GFP sequence precisely into the L. donovani genome. These methods greatly improved the ability to manipulate this parasite genome and will help pave the way for high-throughput functional analysis of Leishmania genes. This study further revealed that double-stranded DNA breaks created by CRISPR-Cas9 were repaired by the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) in Leishmania.

3-D microfabricated electrodes for targeted deep brain stimulation. This work presents a novel 4-sided, 16-channel deep brain stimulation electrode with a custom flexible high-density lead for connectivity with pulse generation electronics. The 3-dimensional electrode enables steering the current field circumferentially. The electrode is fabricated in pieces by micromachining and microfabrication techniques; the pieces are then assembled mechanically to form the electrode, after which the lead is connected. The electrode is modeled by finite element analysis and tested in vitro to validate the design concept, i.e., targeted stimulation. Simulation and experimental results for a targeted stimulation show close agreement. With a symmetric bipolar stimulation configuration, within a 3 mm radius, the electric potential in front of the activated side is at least 3.6 times larger than that on the corresponding two adjacent, not-activated sides, and 9 times larger than the corresponding opposite, not-activated side.

Improving compound quality through in vitro and in silico physicochemical profiling. Many compounds entering clinical studies do not survive the numerous hurdles for a good pharmacological lead to a drug on the market. The reasons for attrition have been widely studied which resulted in more early attention to compound quality related to physical chemistry, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (DMPK), and toxicology/safety. This paper will briefly review current physicochemical in vitro assays and in silico predictions to support compound and library design through to lead optimization. The most important physicochemical properties include lipophilicity (log P/D), pKa, solubility, and permeability. These drive key ADMET properties such as absorption, cell penetration, access to the brain, volume of distribution, plasma protein binding, metabolism, and toxicity, as well as biopharmaceutical behavior. Much data are now available from medium- to high-throughput physchem and ADMET in vitro assays, either in the public domain (see, e.g., PubChem, PubMed) or in drug companies' in-house databases. Such data are increasingly being computer-modelled and used in predictive chemistry. New pipelining technology makes it easier to build and update QSAR models so that such models can use the latest available data to produce robust local and global predictive in silico ADMET models.

Knee osteoarthritis. Efficacy of a new method of  contrast-enhanced musculoskeletal ultrasonography  in detection of synovitis in patients with knee  osteoarthritis in comparison with magnetic  resonance imaging. To develop a new method of digital synovial vascularisation quantification by using contrast-enhanced musculoskeletal ultrasonography (MUS) in detecting synovitis in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA) compared with healthy subjects and MRI. Evaluation of 41 patients with painful knee OA and 6 healthy subjects. The severity of knee pain was evaluated. All patients and all 6 healthy subjects underwent contrast medium-enhanced (CE)-MUS with SonoVue, and 36 patients additionally underwent CEMRI with Magnevist. Joint effusion, synovial thickening and pain were assessed and compared with B-mode and Power Doppler sonography (PDS) as well as contrast medium enhancement. Pain evaluated by the visual analogue scale(VAS) hardly correlated with other markers of disease activity measured by ultrasound (US) in B-mode or MRI. US of the superior recess revealed an effusion or synovial thickening in 58%. PDS findings were positive in 63%, and CE-MUS in the superior knee recess was positive in 95%. MRI showed effusion in the superior recess in 61% and showed positive findings in 82% when using contrast medium. The kappa value was 0.48 between US and MRI with regard to the effusion in the superior recess, and 0.53 between PD signal in the superior recess and effusion in the superior recess by US. Using MRI as the reference standard, there was a sensitivity of 72% for assessing effusion in the superior recess and 81% for assessing effusion in the lateral recess. Assessment of disease activity (synovitis) in knee OA by VAS is not sufficient. US PDS was more sensitive than B-mode, and CE-MUS was more sensitive than PDS and CE-MRI in detecting synovitis in patients with painful knee OA. Also, CE-MRI was more sensitive in detecting inflammatory changes in the superior recess than without contrast medium. Using CE-MUS and performing time/intensity analysis has shown to be a good model for evaluation of an inflammatory process in the setting of knee OA in the superior recess.

Fatty acids and immune function: relevance to inflammatory bowel diseases. Fatty acids may influence immune function through a variety of mechanisms; many of these are associated with changes in fatty acid composition of immune cell membranes. Eicosanoids produced from arachidonic acid have roles in inflammation and immunity. Increased membrane content of n-3 fatty acids results in a changed pattern of production of eicosanoids, resolvins, and cytokines. Changing the fatty acid composition of immune cells also affects T cell reactivity and antigen presentation. Little attention has been paid to the influence of fatty acids on the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. However, there has been considerable interest in fatty acids and gut inflammation.

FG syndrome, an X-linked multiple congenital anomaly syndrome: the clinical phenotype and an algorithm for diagnostic testing. FG syndrome is a rare X-linked multiple congenital anomaly-cognitive impairment disorder caused by the p.R961W mutation in the MED12 gene. We identified all known patients with this mutation to delineate their clinical phenotype and devise a clinical algorithm to facilitate molecular diagnosis. We ascertained 23 males with the p.R961W mutation in MED12 from 9 previously reported FG syndrome families and 1 new family. Six patients are reviewed in detail. These 23 patients were compared with 48 MED12 mutation-negative patients, who had the clinical diagnosis of FG syndrome. Traits that best discriminated between these two groups were chosen to develop an algorithm with high sensitivity and specificity for the p.R961W MED12 mutation. FG syndrome has a recognizable dysmorphic phenotype with a high incidence of congenital anomalies. A family history of X-linked mental retardation, deceased male infants, and/or multiple fetal losses was documented in all families. The algorithm identifies the p.R961W MED12 mutation-positive group with 100% sensitivity and 90% specificity. The clinical phenotype of FG syndrome defines a recognizable pattern of X-linked multiple congenital anomalies and cognitive impairment. This algorithm can assist the clinician in selecting the patients for testing who are most likely to have the recurrent p.R961W MED12 mutation.

[Bronchial diseases: CT imaging features]. Multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) is the imaging modality of reference for the diagnosis of bronchiectasis. MDCT may also detect a focal stenosis, a tumor or multiple morphologic abnormalities of the bronchial tree. It may orient the endoscopist towards the abnormal bronchi, and in all cases assess the extent of the bronchial lesions. The CT findings of bronchial abnormalities include anomalies of bronchial division and origin, bronchial stenosis, bronchial wall thickening, lumen dilatation, and mucoid impaction. The main CT features of bronchiectasis are increased bronchoarterial ratio, lack of bronchial tapering, and visibility of peripheral airways. Other bronchial abnormalities include excessive bronchial collapse at expiration, outpouchings and diverticula, dehiscence, fistulas, and calcifications.


Synthesis and biological evaluation of N-aryl-1,4-dihydropyridines as novel antidyslipidemic and antioxidant agents.

Anorexia nervosa and Wernicke Korsakoff's syndrome: atypical presentation by acute psychosis. A 16-year-old girl was admitted to the emergency department because of acute changes in mental state such as paranoid and nihilistic delusions, confabulations, and distortions of body schema perception. Her history was compatible with anorexia nervosa in that she had lost more than 17 kg in weight over one and a half years. Her body mass index was 14. She was diagnosed with Wernicke Korsakoff's syndrome and was given intravenous thiamine at 250 mg/day. Response was dramatic for nystagmus and gait incoordination but not for other symptoms. After dosage was increased to 750 mg/day all symptoms including psychosis improved. With her increase in food consumption, secondary deterioration was observed and diagnosed as refeeding syndrome. After proper replacements she was completely normal in the 9th month, and her weight was 55 kg. This patient was interesting for the presenting symptoms (psychosis), and improvement by high doses of thiamine replacement, and also for refeeding syndrome during this period.

[Prevalence of hepatitis G, B and C virus infections among positive HIV population in a Tunisian Hospital, La Rabta, Tunis]. The viral hepatitis G and HIV coinfection has been largely treated in the litterature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the coinfection rate in our hospital and to compare the HGV frequency to other hepatitis viruses (B and C) in positive HIV subjects at the Rabta hospital in Tunis, Tunisia. The studied population included 125 HIV positives patients from the infectious diseases unit. The detection of the hepatitis B and C was carried out using serologic test (Elisa-Biorad). The molecular detection of the HGV was realized by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The prevalence of serological markers of hepatitis B (antibodies and/or antigens) and C (antibodies) was respectively 32.25% and 26.4%. HGV RNA was detected in 36.8% of the studied population. The unprotected intercourse was the predominant risk factor of the HGV contamination. Among the HGV (+) patients, 28.2% were carriers of the hepatitis C antibodies (anti-HCV). This work was the first study enabling to assess the coinfection rate of viral hepatitis B, C and G with HIV patients (+) in Rabta Hospital. The regular screening of HGV is recommended regarding its high frequency and the possibility of its pathogenic role.

Treatments and outcomes of peritoneal surface tumors through a centralized national service (United kingdom). Treatment of peritoneal surface malignancies with combined cytoreductive surgery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy may improve oncologic outcome. To better define treatment pathways, five-year results in patients referred to one of two centralized national treatment centers in the United Kingdom were analyzed. A prospective database of patients referred to the Manchester Peritoneal Tumor Service, established in 2002, was analyzed. Outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier life tables and Cox models. Two hundred seventy-eight patients (median age, 56.9 (range, 16-86) years) were considered by a dedicated multidisciplinary team and tracked on seven clinical pathways. Among the 118 surgically treated, the most common diagnosis was pseudomyxoma peritonei (101 patients, 86%). Major complications occurred in 11 patients (9%); there was no 30-day mortality. Where complete cytoreduction was achieved, three-year and five-year tumor-related survival rates were 94% and 86%, respectively. In the Cox model, incompleteness of cytoreduction (P = 0.001) and high-grade tumor (P < 0.0001) were independent prognosticators of poor outcome. The establishment of a national treatment center has allowed refinement of techniques to achieve internationally recognized results. Having achieved low levels of morbidity and mortality in the treatment of mainly pseudomyxoma peritonei of appendiceal origin, the technique of cytoreductive surgery and heated intraperitoneal chemotherapy may be considered for peritoneal carcinomatosis of colorectal origin.

On admission hypomagnesemia in critically ill children: Risk factors and outcome. To determine the frequency and associated risk factors of hypomagnesemia in pediatric intensive care unit on admission in a developing country. It is a retrospective chart review of 179 children aged 1 mo - 15yr admitted in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of our university during 18 months and recorded serum Mg level on admission. Patients were divided into two groups according to their Mg level (Normo-magnesemic and Hypomagnesemic) and their p-value, crude and adjusted odds ratios (AoR) were calculated. Upon admission in PICU 79(44%) patients were found hypomagnesemia. There was no difference in age and gender between two groups. The important risk factors identified were age greater than one yr (p 0.05, AOR 3.71), sepsis (p 0.03, AOR 3.11), hypokalemia (p 0.06, AOR 1.8), hypocalcemia (p 0.05, AOR 1.6), diuretic use (p 0.05, AOR 1.37), Aminoglycoside use (p 0.003, AOR 3.12), and hospitalization greater than five days (p 0.03, AOR 1.71). Those with normo-magnesemic had higher mortality rate (32/100 or 32%) than those with hypomagnesemia (22/79 or 27.8%). The present finding indicates that hypomagnesemia is a common among PICU patients and is influenced by several factors.

Pervasive developmental disorder behavior in adolescents with intellectual disability and co-occurring somatic chronic diseases. Evidence on the association between somatic chronic diseases in ID-adolescents and the full range of pervasive developmental disorder behavior (PDD behavior) is scarce. The aim of the present study is to assess the association between somatic chronic diseases in ID-adolescents and mild PDD behavior. We obtained data on 1044 ID-adolescents, aged 12-18, attending secondary schools in the Netherlands. Parents of the adolescents completed the Dutch version of the Children's Social Behavior Questionnaire (CSBQ) parent version, covering a wide range of PDD behavior, and questions about chronic diseases and background characteristics of their child. ID-adolescents with somatic chronic diseases showed more PDD behavior, in particular milder forms, than their peers without chronic diseases. In addition, ID-adolescents with somatic chronic diseases in combination with pervasive development disorders (PDD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also showed more PDD behavior than their peers with only PDD/ADHD. Clinicians should be extra alert on PDD behavior, in particular the milder forms, in ID-adolescents when somatic chronic diseases are present. However, to strengthen our results about the relationship between somatic chronic diseases in ID-adolescents and PDD behavior studies are needed using both the CSBQ and standardized diagnostic instruments.

[Association between tobacco smoking and pulmonary tuberculosis]. Numerous studies evaluate the influence of tobacco smoking on the tuberculosis (TB) development, with the results indicating that smoking can be also considered as important risk factor in TB. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of tobacco smoking as the risk factor in the development of TB as well as in its clinical course. We analyzed data from the medical records of 192 consecutively hospitalized TB patients (124 males and 68 females) in the Institute of Pulmonary Diseases and Tuberculosis, Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade in the period from 2005 to 2007. Among the analyzed TB patients there were more smokers (63.5%) than nonsmokers (36.5%). The majority of the smokers (73.8%) belonged to a middle age group (35-54 years) while the majority of nonsmokers (64.3%) were older than 55 years. Sex ratio among the smokers showed the domination of males (80.3%). There were significantly more males in the smoking group and more females in the nonsmoking group (chi2 = 34.402, p < 0.0001). Most smokers (68.9%) smoked more than 20 cigarettes daily. The average index of pack/years among all of the examinated patients was 32.75 +/- 18.26. Cavitary pulmonary lesions were more frequently verified in the smokers (64.2%) than in the nonsmokers (35.8%). The sputum acid-fast bacillus smear-positive finding was more frequent in the smokers (78%) than in the nonsmokers (22%). The nonsmoking TB patients had more accompanied immunodeficient diseases (34%) than the smoking ones (19%). Body-mass index was lower in the smokers (21.75) than in the nonsmokers (23.80), although this difference did not reach the statistical significance. There are more smokers than nonsmokers in TB patients. Smokers more frequently have cavitary forms of TB with sputum acid-fast bacillus smear--positive finding than nonsmokers.

OFSETH: smart medical textile for continuous monitoring of respiratory motions under magnetic resonance imaging. The potential impact of optical fiber sensors embedded into medical textiles for the continuous monitoring of the patient during Magnetic Resonance Imaging is presented. We report on two pure optical sensing technologies for respiratory movements monitoring - a macro bending sensor and a Bragg grating sensor, designed to measure the elongation due to abdominal and thoracic motions during breathing. We demonstrate that the two sensors can successfully sense textile elongation between, 0% and 3%, while maintaining the stretching properties of the textile substrates for a good comfort of the patient.

Does Arkadia contribute to TGF-Î²1-induced IgA expression through up-regulation of Smad signaling in IgA nephropathy? Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) is an immune-complex-mediated glomerulonephritis characterized by the presence of IgA deposits in mesangial and paramesangial regions. However, the exact mechanism involved in IgA deposition is still unknown. TGF-Î²(1) that mediates the progression of IgAN is well established as a critical IgA class (isotype) switching factor, and Smad proteins are critical intracellular mediators in the expression of TGF-Î²(1)-targeted genes, which suggest that TGF-Î² signaling has been implicated in the primary pathogenesis of IgAN. Arkadia, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, can amplify TGF-Î² signaling through regulating Smads degradation. When these findings are considered together, it is of interest to explore how Arkadia and Smad signaling affect TGF-Î²(1)-induced IgA expression in IgAN. Therefore, we propose that Arkadia could positively contribute to TGF-Î²(1)-induced IgA secretion through up-regulation of Smad signaling in the pathogenesis of IgAN.


Adipokine responses to acute resistance exercise in trained and untrained men.

Adiponectin inhibits allograft rejection in murine cardiac transplantation. Low levels of plasma adiponectin, an adipocytokine that possesses anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic properties, frequently observed among obese subjects correlate with higher prevalence of several cardiovascular diseases. This study investigated whether adiponectin modulates allograft rejection in major histocompatibility complex class II-mismatched cardiac transplants. We heterotopically transplanted Bm12 allografts into adiponectin-deficient (APN-/-, C57BL/6 background) or wild-type (APN+/+) mice. Some APN-/- mice received adiponectin reconstitution by adenovirus. Histologic analyses assessed allograft rejection, and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction evaluated the genes for cytokines/chemokines associated with the immune and inflammatory responses. In addition, we tested the effect of adiponectin on proliferation and cytokine/chemokine production in mouse T lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3 antibodies. Allografts transplanted to APN-/- mice showed severe acute rejection relative to transplants in APN+/+ hosts accompanied by increased accumulation of CD4- and CD8-positive T lymphocytes and Mac3-positive macrophages. Adiponectin provision by adenovirus in APN-/- mice reversed these exacerbated responses to allografting. The rejected allografts in APN-/- mice contained significantly higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and regulated on activation normal t expressed and presumably secreted. Moreover, adiponectin significantly suppressed proliferation and production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, regulated on activation normal t expressed and presumably secreted, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and interferon-gamma inducible protein-10 in mouse T lymphocytes stimulated in vitro with anti-CD3 antibodies. These observations provide new mechanistic insight into immunoregulation in allograft recipients relative to obesity, an increasingly prevalent risk factor. Adiponectin may offer a new therapeutic target for allograft rejection after cardiac transplantation.

Nurses' satisfaction with shiftwork and associations with work, home and health characteristics: a survey in the Netherlands. This paper is a report of a study conducted to determine if satisfaction with irregular working hours that are a form of shiftwork operates as a mediator between work and home characteristics and health problems. Shiftwork contributes to health problems, decreased well-being and poorer health habits. It also affects employees' decisions to leave the healthcare sector. Although many nurses voluntarily work shifts, there have been few studies of their satisfaction with irregular working hours when these are a form of shiftwork. A survey was carried out with 144 nurses working in three nursing homes and one care home in the Netherlands. Questionnaires were distributed in 2003 to 233 nurses who worked shifts (response rate 60%). The questionnaire contained items on work and home characteristics, satisfaction with irregular working hours that are a form of shiftwork and health. A new scale to measure satisfaction with irregular working hours was constructed. All work characteristics, but no home characteristics, were associated with satisfaction with irregular working hours. The work characteristics 'job demands' and the home characteristics 'autonomy at home' and 'home demands' were associated with health. Satisfaction with irregular working hours did not mediate between work/home characteristics and health. Those reporting more social support, lower job demands and more job autonomy were more satisfied with their irregular working times that were a form of shiftwork. Satisfaction with irregular working hours is a useful construct that requires further longitudinal study. The results also underline the importance of considering home characteristics when predicting health outcomes.

[Change of airflow patterns inside the maxillary sinus influenced by uncinate process]. to study the change of the airflow patterns inside the maxillary sinus that influenced by uncinate process. Two kinds of cadavers were used, one had a normal uncinate process and the others had an out-gressin uncinate process. The airflow patterns inside the maxillary sinus were compared between them. Also compared were the airflow patterns inside the maxillary sinus before and after the excision of the uncinate process. The airflow patterns inside the maxillary sinus in cadavers with a normal uncinate process exchanged actively. The smoke easily entered the maxillary sinus and could be found easily. It entered in the maxillary sinus with a whirlpool form. It cost about (11.4 +/- 1.4) s till the smoke dissipated from the maxillary sinus. On the other hand, in cadavers with an out-gressin uncinate process, the airflow patterns inside the maxillary sinus exchanged inductively. The smoke entered in the maxillary sinus and could be observed, but it was less than that in cadavers with a normal uncinate process. The form of the smoke could not be judged. It cost (24.2 +/- 1.6) s till the smoke dissipated from the maxillary sinus. The airflow patterns inside the maxillary sinus became inactive after the excision of the uncinate process in all kinds of cadavers. The normal uncinate process permits the physiological commutation of air inside the maxillary sinus.


Biologic principles of immunotherapy for malignant gliomas.

High-level expression and purification of heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) with SUMO fusion. Heparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) can stimulate the division of various cell types and has potential clinical applications that stimulate growth and differentiation. HB-EGF has an EGF-like domain typical of all members of the EGF family. The high expression of active HB-EGF in Escherichia coli has not been successful as the protein contains three intra-molecular disulfide bonds, the same as other members of the EGF super family that are difficult to form correctly in the bacterial intracellular environment. This work fused the non-glycosylated HB-EGF gene with a small ubiquitin-related modifier gene (SUMO) by over-lap PCR. The resulting fusion gene SUMO-HBEGF was highly expressed in BL21(DE3) that the soluble SUMO-HBEGF was up to 30% of the total cellular protein. The fusion protein was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and cleaved by a SUMO-specific protease Ulp1 to obtain the native HB-EGF, which was further purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. MTT assays indicated the purified HB-EGF, as well as SUMO-HBEGF, had mitogenic activity in a dose-dependent manner.

Combined role of extracellular matrix and chemokines on peripheral lymphocyte migration in growth hormone transgenic mice. Previous evidence indicated that growth hormone (GH) modulates cell migration in the thymus, and that extracellular matrix and chemokines are involved. Herein, we studied migration of peripheral lymphocytes derived from spleen and lymph nodes of GH-transgenic (GH-Tg) mice. We initially found that the relative cell numbers (normalized per gram of body weight) in lymph nodes and spleens from GH-Tg were higher at all ages tested (2-3, 7 and 12 months), as compared to wild type age-matched controls. Functionally, we found that lymphocyte migration triggered by laminin or fibronectin was enhanced in cells from GH-Tg versus control mice, independent of the organ from which the cells were derived (as ascertained in young adult animals). However, such an enhancement in migration was statistically significant only for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells from mesenteric lymph nodes. Migration of lymphocytes from mesenteric lymph nodes of GH-Tg mice, triggered by the chemokine CXCL12, in conjunction with laminin or fibronectin, was enhanced compared to lymphocytes from control mice. Rather surprisingly, the membrane levels of the corresponding extracellular matrix or chemokine receptors in peripheral lymphoid organs of GH-Tg mice did not necessarily correlate with the changes seen in migratory responses. In conclusion, our data show for the first time that GH alters lymphocyte migration in the periphery of the immune system. Considering that GH is used as an adjuvant therapeutic agent in immunodeficiencies, including AIDS, the concepts defined herein provide relevant background knowledge for future GH-related immune interventions.


Remapping in the ipsilesional motor cortex after VR-based training: a pilot fMRI study.

Solid-phase synthesis of thiazolo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives using FriedlÃ¤nder reaction. Traceless solid-phase synthesis of 2,5,6,7-tetrasubstituted thiazolo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives is described. Thorpe-Ziegler type cyclization of solid supported cyanocarbonimidodithioate with alpha-halo ketones afforded thiazole resin, which were converted to the desired thiazolopyridine resin by the FriedlÃ¤nder protocol under microwave irradiation conditions. After oxidation of sulfides to sulfones, nucleophilic desulfonative substitution with amines gave the target thiazolo[4,5-b]pyridine derivatives in good overall yields.

Broad-Bandwidth Chiral Sum Frequency Generation Spectroscopy for Probing the Kinetics of Proteins at Interfaces. The kinetics of proteins at interfaces plays an important role in biological functions and inspires solutions to fundamental problems in biomedical sciences and engineering. Nonetheless, due to the lack of surface-specific and structural-sensitive biophysical techniques, it still remains challenging to probe protein kinetics in situ and in real time without the use of spectroscopic labels at interfaces. Broad-bandwidth chiral sum frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy has been recently developed for protein kinetic studies at interfaces by tracking the chiral vibrational signals of proteins. In this article, we review our recent progress in kinetic studies of proteins at interfaces using broad-bandwidth chiral SFG spectroscopy. We illustrate the use of chiral SFG signals of protein side chains in the C-H stretch region to monitor self-assembly processes of proteins at interfaces. We also present the use of chiral SFG signals from the protein backbone in the N-H stretch region to probe the real-time kinetics of proton exchange between protein and water at interfaces. In addition, we demonstrate the applications of spectral features of chiral SFG that are typical of protein secondary structures in both the amide I and the N-H stretch regions for monitoring the kinetics of aggregation of amyloid proteins at membrane surfaces. These studies exhibit the power of broad-bandwidth chiral SFG to study protein kinetics at interfaces and the promise of this technique in research areas of surface science to address fundamental problems in biomedical and material sciences.

Wiring photosystem I for direct solar hydrogen production. The generation of H(2) by the use of solar energy is a promising way to supply humankind's energy needs while simultaneously mitigating environmental concerns that arise due to climate change. The challenge is to find a way to connect a photochemical module that harnesses the sun's energy to a catalytic module that generates H(2) with high quantum yields and rates. In this review, we describe a technology that employs a "molecular wire" to connect a terminal [4Fe-4S] cluster of Photosystem I directly to a catalyst, which can be either a Pt nanoparticle or the distal [4Fe-4S] cluster of an [FeFe]- or [NiFe]-hydrogenase enzyme. The keys to connecting these two moieties are surface-located cysteine residues, which serve as ligands to Fe-S clusters and which can be changed through site-specific mutagenesis to glycine residues, and the use of a molecular wire terminated in sulfhydryl groups to connect the two modules. The sulfhydryl groups at the end of the molecular wire form a direct chemical linkage to a suitable catalyst or can chemically rescue a [4Fe-4S] cluster, thereby generating a strong coordination bond. Specifically, the molecular wire can connect the F(B) iron-sulfur cluster of Photosystem I either to a Pt nanoparticle or, by using the same type of genetic modification, to the differentiated iron atom of the distal [4Fe-4S].(Cys)(3)(Gly) cluster of hydrogenase. When electrons are supplied by a sacrificial donor, this technology forms the cathode of a photochemical half-cell that evolves H(2) when illuminated. If such a device were connected to the anode of a photochemical half-cell that oxidizes water, an in vitro solar energy converter could be realized that generates only O(2) and H(2) in the light. A similar methodology can be used to connect Photosystem I to other redox proteins that have surface-located [4Fe-4S] clusters. The controlled light-driven production of strong reductants by such systems can be used to produce other biofuels or to provide mechanistic insights into enzymes catalyzing multielectron, proton-coupled reactions.

Four-phase rhinomanometry: a multicentric retrospective analysis of 36,563 clinical measurements. Rhinomanometry can still be considered as the standard technique for the objective assessment of the ventilatory function of the nose. Reliable technical requirements are given by fast digital sensors and modern information technology. However, the xyimaging of the pressure-flow relation typically shows loops as a sign of hysteresis, with the need for resolution of the breath in four phases. The three pillars of 4-phase rhinomanometry (4PR) are the replacement of estimations by measurements, the introduction of parameters related to the subjective sensing of obstruction, and the graphical information regarding the disturbed function of the nasal valve. In a meta-analysis of 36,563 clinical measurements, we analyze the errors of the "classic" parameters (flow in 150 Pa) and reject the further use of these parameters as obsolete, because they correspond to an inaccurate estimation rather than proper measurement. In a pre-study of 1580 measurements, the logarithmic effective resistance (Reff) was found to have the highest correlation with values obtained from a visual analog scale. Next, we classify the inspiratory effective resistance in 20,069 measurements without treatment and 16,494 measurements after decongestion with xylometazoline 0.1 % spray in 20 % percentiles. The gradation of obstruction delivers not only "normal" values but also indications for the severity of the obstruction in adult Caucasian noses. Adoption of the distribution for the growing nose and analysis of the total nasal resistance is addressed, and typical findings of nasal valve phenomena are outlined.


Ghrelin, des-acyl ghrelin and nesfatin-1 in gastric X/A-like cells: role as regulators of food intake and body weight.

Effect of the 894G>T polymorphism of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase on vascular reactivity following maximal dynamic exercise. Considering that the role of nitric oxide as a vasodilator is increased after an acute bout of exercise and that the 894G>T polymorphism of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase seems to reduce the nitric oxide release in response to shear stress, the present study investigated the 894G>T polymorphism in relation to vascular reactivity following maximal dynamic exercise. We studied 110 healthy volunteers (wild-type group 45.5% and polymorphic group 54.5%). The protocol included vascular reactivity assessment at baseline and during reactive hyperemia, before, 10, 60 and 120 min after a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test. Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples to determine the 894G>T polymorphism. There were no differences between the wild-type and polymorphic groups concerning anthropometric, metabolic and hemodynamic characteristics. Blood flow, before maximal exercise, was similar between the wild-type and the polymorphic groups. The polymorphic group presented lower vascular reactivity regardless of time (P = 0.019 for group main effect), and posthoc analysis revealed that polymorphic patients had lower values than wild-type only at the 120 min measurement (P = 0.002). Concerning within-group analysis, vascular reactivity increased at 10 min after exercise (P = 0.029) returning to baseline at 120 min (P = 0.005) in the polymorphic group. Patients with the 894G>T polymorphism had lower vascular reactivity after a single bout of exercise.

[The assessment of remote cytogenetic effects in clean up workers of Chernobyl accident]. Cytogenetic study cohort of the liquidators of the consequences of Chernobyl accident over 4-6 years after clean-up working in the alienation zone was carried out by conventional method. For The results of study liquidators cohort of 1986-1987 years have shown decreasing the frequency of cells with unstable chromosome aberrations for 25-30% per each year of examination. The frequency of chromosomal and chromatid-type aberrations have been also decreasing. The increasing of frequency radiation markers (dicentrics and rings) was observed for liquidators who worked in Chernobyl in 1988 year. Significant distinctions on other cytogenetics parameters as well as for liquidators who worked in Chernobyl in 1989 year were not observed perhaps of small number of examined cohorts. Nevertheless level of chromosome aberrations observed in remote post radiation period was significantly higher then controls that may be caused by radiation-induced genome instability. Obtained data show the importance of cytogenetic examination of that cohort for estimation and the prognosis the risk of delayed negative consequences of exposure.

Molecular characterization and association analysis of FBXO40 with partial hematological indexes in pig. F-box proteins are quite significant ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulators in eukaryotic cells. FBXO40, a member of this large family, alters its expression pattern in muscle atrophy. Here we isolated most of the verified porcine FBXO40 coding sequence (CDS) (2258 bp) and assigned it to the porcine chromosome 13q4.1-4.6 by using the INRA-Minnesota porcine radiation hybrid panel, and we also explored the tissue expression distributions, which is relatively high in longissimus dorsi muscle, heart, low in kidney, small intestine, brain, hypophysis, lymphonode, thymus, spleen, large intestine, ovary, stomach, and undetectable in testis, liver, uterus and thyroid gland. Inferring phylogenetic tree was constructed to study the evolutionary implications. Moreover, a HindII (HincII)-RFLP (A/C) polymorphism in 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of porcine FBXO40 gene was demonstrated by sequencing and PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Statistical analysis result of this polymorphism showed that the allele A was predominant in all detected indigenous breeds, but C in western introduced commercial breeds. The SNP was further analyzed in our experimental pig population including Tongcheng, Landrace, Large White, and crossbreds of Large White Ã (Landrace Ã Tongcheng) and Landrace Ã (Large White Ã Tongcheng). The association analysis results indicated that the A/C base substitution was associate with some hematological indexes, the hemoglobin concentration (P < 0.0001), mean corpuscular volume hemoglobin concentration (P = 0.0002) and mean corpuscular volume (P = 0.0138).


Magnetic resonance histology of the adult zebrafish brain: optimization of fixation and gadolinium contrast enhancement.

New agents for AML and MDS. The heterogeneity of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) has led to a multiplicity of treatments, from cytotoxic agents to signal transduction modulators, cell-cycle inhibitors and epigenetic therapies. While some have shown promising initial results, the outlook for AML patients, particularly older and relapsed patients, as well as patients whose cells exhibit certain adverse chromosomal abnormalities or mutant oncoproteins, continues to be grim. Combination chemotherapy using new agents that act at a number of different levels may provide the greatest potential for successful future therapies. A select number of new agents, approaches and combinations are reviewed here.

Synthesis and Characterization of Hapten-Protein Conjugates for Antibody Production against Cyanogenic Glycosides. Consumption of cyanogenic plants can cause serious health problems for humans. The ability to detect and quantify cyanogenic glycosides, capable of generating cyanide, could contribute to prevention of cyanide poisoning from the consumption of improperly processed cyanogenic plants. Hapten-protein conjugates were synthesized with amygdalin and linamarin by using a novel approach. Polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing four New Zealand White rabbits with synthesized amygdalin-bovine serum albumin and linamarin-bovine serum albumin immunogen. This is the first time an antibody was produced against linamarin. Antibody titer curves were obtained from all the four rabbits by using a noncompetitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. High antibody titer was obtained at dilutions greater than 1:50,000 from both immunogens. This new method is an important step forward in preventing ingestion of toxic cyanogenic glycosides.

The antecedents of e-learning outcome: an examination of system quality, technology readiness, and learning behavior. The rapid advancement of Internet and computer technology has not only influenced the way we live, but also the way we learn. Due to the implementation of e-learning in urban junior high schools in Taiwan, it has become essential to find out how external and internal factors affect junior high school students' online learning behavior, which consequently affects their learning outcome. The present study aims to propose a conceptual structural equation model to investigate the relationships among e-Learning system quality (eLSQ), technology readiness (TR), learning behavior (LB), and learning outcome (LO), and to demonstrate the direct and indirect effect of eLSQ and TR on LO from the perspectives of LB. Data collected from 10 urban junior high schools in Taiwan (N = 376) were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results reveal that both eLSQ and TR have a direct and significant impact on LB. However, eLSQ and TR influence LO indirectly through LB. In addition, LB has a direct and positive significant influence on LO. Managerial implications are proposed and research limitations are discussed.

Nicotine improves AF64A-induced spatial memory deficits in Morris water maze in rats. Ethylcholine mustard aziridinium ion (AF64A) is a neurotoxic derivative of choline that produces not only long-term presynaptic cholinergic deficits, but also various memory deficits in rats similar to some characteristics observed in Alzheimer's disease patients. This study investigated whether nicotine (NCT) administration attenuated spatial learning deficits induced by intracerebroventricular AF64A treatment. AF64A (6 nmol/6 microl)-or saline (SAL)-treated rats were trained in Morris water maze task. NCT (0.025-0.25mg/kg) was subcutaneously injected 5 min before the training every day. The results showed that moderate dose (0.10mg/kg) of NCT attenuated AF64A-induced prolongation of escape latency. Furthermore, NCT dose-dependently recovered the AF64A-induced decrease of time spent in the target quadrant in the probe test. These results suggest that NCT improves AF64A-induced spatial memory deficits, and thus it is a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of memory deficits in dementia.

Synthesis, pharmacological studies and molecular modeling of some tetracyclic 1,3-diazepinium chlorides. Seven new 1,3-diazepinium chlorides exhibiting some structural similarities to the 1,4-benzodiazepines were synthesized. In a Hippocratic screen using mice, three of these salts, 3-methoxy-6-oxo-7,13-dihydro-6H-benzofuro[2,3-e]pyrido[1,2-a][1,3]diazepin-12-ium chloride (8a), 3-methoxy-9-methyl-6-oxo-7,13-dihydro-6H-benzofuro[2,3-e]pyrido[1,2-a][1,3]diazepin-12-ium chloride (8c) and 3-methoxy-11-methyl-6-oxo-7,13-dihydro-6H-benzofuro[2,3-e]pyrido[1,2-a][1,3]diazepin-12-ium chloride (8e) were examined for their effect on the central nervous system, and their activities compared to that of diazepam. On their own, salts 8a, 8c and 8e solicited no sedative effects on the behaviour of the animals. However, they elicited significant effects in combination with diazepam on diazepam-induced activities such as decreased motor activity, ataxia and loss of righting reflex. Compounds 8a and 8c were fitted into the pharmacophore/receptor model developed by Cook et al. with interaction at the L(1), H(1) and A(2) sites indicating that they are potential inverse agonists of the Bz receptor. The compounds displayed some affinity for the alpha1 isoform of the GABA(A)/BzR (L(Di) interaction) but are non-selective for alpha5 (no L(2) interaction). Results of binding affinity studies showed that compound 8a is mildly selective for the alpha1 receptor although not very potent (K(i)=746.5nM). The significant potentiation of diazepam-induced ataxia and decreased motor activity by compounds 8a and 8c in the Hippocratic screen may be associated with alpha1 selectivity.

Fenretinide induces mitochondrial ROS and inhibits the mitochondrial respiratory chain in neuroblastoma. Fenretinide induces apoptosis in neuroblastoma by induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we investigated the role of mitochondria in fenretinide-induced cytotoxicity and ROS production in six neuroblastoma cell lines. ROS induction by fenretinide was of mitochondrial origin, demonstrated by detection of superoxide with MitoSOX, the scavenging effect of the mitochondrial antioxidant MitoQ and reduced ROS production in cells without a functional mitochondrial respiratory chain (Rho zero cells). In digitonin-permeabilized cells, a fenretinide concentration-dependent decrease in ATP synthesis and substrate oxidation was observed, reflecting inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. However, inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain was not required for ROS production. Co-incubation of fenretinide with inhibitors of different complexes of the respiratory chain suggested that fenretinide-induced ROS production occurred via complex II. The cytotoxicity of fenretinide was exerted through the generation of mitochondrial ROS and, at higher concentrations, also through inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

[The rule of lymph node metastasis of adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung]. To investigate the rule of lymph node metastasis of adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung. The data of 361 surgically treated patients with adenosquamous carcinoma of the lung from October 1965 to June 2003 were collected and retrospectively reviewed. The classification of regional lymph node stations and TNM stage were determined according to the UICC criteria (1997). The route and patterns as well as influencing factors of lymph node metastasis were analyzed by SPSS 10.0 software. The median follow-up period was 5.5 years (range, 1.4 to 23.4 years). The analysis of the route of mediastinal lymph node metastasis in the 361 cases showed that the tumor originated in the left upper lobe firstly metastasized to station 5 (A-P window), tumor in the right upper lobe to the station 4 (lower paratracheal), then secondly to station 7 (subcarinal), lastly to station 3 from the tumor in the left upper lobe or to the station 2 from the tumor in the right upper lobe. It was found that the tumors originated from the lower lobe, firstly metastasized to station 7, secondly to station 9 or 4 from the right lobe; or station 5 from left lower lobe, lastly to station 3 or 2 in the mediastinum. For the tumor in the middle lobe, mainly metastasized to station 7, 4 and 2. The skip mediastinal lymph node metastasis but N1 negative most commonly metastasized to station 7, then to station 4 from the tumor in the right lung and 5 from the tumor in the left lung. The prognosis of patients with a single skipping metastasis to mediastinal lymph node (N1-, SMLN) was better than that in the other patients with mediastinal lymph node metastases. The lung cancer growing in a different location has a different route and skipping metastasis to mediastinal lymph nodes. The patterns of lymph node metastasis affect prognosis. The prognosis of patients with single skipping metastasis to mediastinal lymph nodes but negative pulmonary hilar lymph node is better than that in the other patients with multiple station mediastinal lymph node metastases. The "N1-, SMLN" pattern ought to be considered as a special lymph nodal metastasis with better prognosis.

Diagnostic dilemmas, course, management and prognosis of traumatic lung cysts in children. The patients were 8 and 9 years old respectively. Both were passengers in a vehicle and suffered multisystem injuries. Case no.1 suffered a fractured occipital bone, lung contusions and a small pneumothorax in addition to the traumatic lung cysts in the left lung. Case 2 sustained contused and lacerated liver and right lung cysts. CT examination showed cystic areas in the lung which were diagnostic in case 2. In case 1 a traumatic rupture of diaphragm could not be ruled out and the patient underwent an exploratory laparotomy to deal with the same. The lung cysts in both the patients were treated conservatively and both showed resolution in repeat CT scans done at 6 months.

Current results of minimally invasive surgical ablation for isolated atrial fibrillation. The Cox maze surgical ablation operation is a highly effective treatment for patients with atrial fibrillation, but adoption has been limited by procedure complexity and invasiveness. Minimally invasive approaches using nonsternotomy limited access and eliminating cardiopulmonary bypass have been developed. All published series of minimally invasive surgical ablation for isolated, atrial fibrillation were reviewed. Series were analyzed for method of access, energy source, procedure success, and complications. Outcomes were compiled based on type of atrial fibrillation, method and length of follow-up, and freedom from atrial fibrillation with and without antiarrhythmic drugs. There are 14 published series with outcomes reported in 604 unique patients. Most procedures are performed through bilateral minithoracotomies with video assistance, although in later series a totally thoracoscopic approach is more commonly used. Bipolar radiofrequency is the predominant energy source used, and bilateral pulmonary vein isolation the most common lesion set, with some reports adding ganglionic plexi ablation and more extensive ablation lines. Approximately 53% of the procedures were performed for paroxysmal and 47% for persistent/long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation. Overall freedom from atrial fibrillation at 6-12 months is 84% (59%-91%), with 89% (79%-100%) in paroxysmal and 62% (25%-87%) in persistent/long-standing persistent patients. Overall freedom from atrial fibrillation off of antiarrhythmic drugs is 65% (57%-87%). Results approximating those of the Cox maze procedure are achieved with minimally invasive surgical ablation of atrial fibrillation in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Further developments are necessary to further simplify and standardize the procedure, to replicate the results in larger series from more centers, to standardize the reporting of results, and to define a more effective procedure for persistent and long-standing persistent atrial fibrillation.

Extramammary Paget's disease with intracytoplasmic lumen formation. Extramammary Paget's disease (EMPD) is regarded as a malignancy most likely derived from or differentiated into apocrine sweat duct and gland. The tumor cells in EMPD usually have abundant pale cytoplasm and large pleomorphic nuclei. We present a case with EMPD where the tumor included many signet ring cells, cells with intracytoplasmic lumen formation and glandular formation. This case is interesting in that the tumor included many cells with intracytoplasmic lumen formation. Signet ring cells and glandular formation support the traditional speculation that EMPD is derived from apocrine sweat gland and intracytoplasmic lumen formation may mimic the intrafollicular apocrine duct.

Detection and quantification of DNA adsorbed on solid surfaces by using liquid crystals. Conventional DNA detection is often accomplished by using UV-vis or fluorescence spectrometry, which requires at least 1 microL of DNA solution. Herein, we report a label-free, liquid-crystal (LC)-based DNA quantification method that is suitable for characterizing DNA solution volumes of <1 microL. The detection principle of this method is based on the disruption of the orientations of LCs by surface-immobilized DNA, which leads to distinct optical textures of LCs visible to the naked eye. However, this method is successful only when the buffer contains divalent cations such as calcium or magnesium. The limit of detection of this method is approximately 4 microg/mL DNA, and only 10 nL of DNA solution is required, which means that as little as 40 pg of DNA can be detected by using this method. This LC-based detection method is also simple to apply and has the potential to be integrated with lab-on-a-chip devices for DNA analysis.

Help-negation and suicidal ideation: the role of depression, anxiety and hopelessness. Help-negation is expressed behaviorally by the refusal or avoidance of available help and cognitively by the inverse relationship between self-reported symptoms of psychological distress and help-seeking intentions. The current study examined the association between suicidal ideation and intentions to seek help from friends, family and professional mental health sources in a sample of 302 Australian university students. Participants were 77.5% female and aged from 18-25 years old, with 85.4% aged 21 years or younger. Higher levels of suicidal ideation were related to lower help-seeking intentions for family, friends, and professional mental health care, and higher intentions to seek help from no one. Moderation effects indicated that higher levels of depressive symptoms strengthen the help-negating effect of suicidal ideation for seeking help from friends, family and no one. The results indicate that, even at subclinical levels, suicidal ideation impedes the cognitive help-seeking process at the decision making stage. The results also highlight the importance of improving our understanding of why young people become reluctant to seek help as their levels of suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms increase. Raising awareness that the experience of suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms can promote intentions to avoid help might reduce the help-negation effect when symptoms are first recognized.

Dynamic NMR spectroscopy of three 2,2'-dialkyl/aryl-1-picrylhydrazines in liquid solution. We have studied and compared the proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectra of a series of three 2,2'-di(alkyl/aryl)-1-(2,4,6-trinitrophenyl)hydrazines at 500 MHz in liquid toluene-d(8), with a view to learning details of the internal conformation changes taking place, as a function of temperature. Herein "alkyl" denotes 'methyl', and "aryl" denotes 'phenyl'. The synthesis and characterization of 2-phenyl,2'-methyl-1-picrylhydrazine is reported. One goal of the present study was to afford a comparison with the oxidation products, i.e., the three corresponding hydrazyl free radicals - which show striking differences. All the hydrazine molecules in liquid solution occur as interconverting enantiomorphic pairs (atropisomers). Advanced techniques for obtaining the relevant activation energies and pseudo-thermodynamic parameters (Arrhenius and Eyring) have been utilized, and these parameters are listed and discussed. The three hydrazines turn out be very similar with respect to their internal dynamics.

Phenolic metabolites of grape antioxidant dietary fiber in rat urine. Grape antioxidant dietary fiber (GADF) combines the putative health benefits of fiber and polyphenols. Polyphenolic metabolites may play a key role in the overall biological effects of this supplement. We identified phenolic GADF metabolites in rat urine at different times after oral administration, using HPLC-ESI-MS/MS techniques. The phenolic metabolic outcome of GADF is essentially an array of mono- and polyconjugated epicatechins and free or conjugated smaller phenolic acids, some of them never reported before. We have detected 18 mono-, di-, and triconjugates of epicatechin with glucuronide, methyl and sulfate moieties and small phenolic acids both free and conjugated. The results suggest that the procyanidin oligomers are both depolymerized in the digestive tract into epicatechin conjugates and degraded by the colonic microbiota into phenolic acids and their conjugates. For several hours after ingestion of GADF, a great variety of phenolic species, including some with an intact catechol group, are in contact with the digestive tract tissues before, during and after metabolization, and many of them are systemically bioavailable before being excreted.


Early Changes in Circulating Tumor Cells Are Associated with Response and Survival Following Treatment of Metastatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms.

Stent-assisted coiling of intracranial aneurysms: clinical and angiographic results in 216 consecutive aneurysms. Stent-assisted coiling has expanded the treatment of intracranial aneurysms, but the rates of procedure-related neurological complications and the incidence of angiographic aneurysm recurrence of this novel treatment are not yet well known. We present our experience with stent-assisted coiling with special emphasis on procedure-related neurological complications and incidence of angiographic recurrence. Clinical and angiographic outcomes of 1137 consecutive patients (1325 aneurysms) coiled with and without stent-assisted coiling technique from January 2002 to January 2009 were retrospectively analyzed. There were 1109 aneurysms (83.5%) treated without and 216 (16.5%) treated with stents (15 of 216; 6.9% balloon-expandable versus 201 of 216; 93.1% self-expandable stents). Stents were delivered after coiling in 55.1% (119 of 216) and before coiling in 44.9% (97 of 216) of the cases. Permanent neurological procedure-related complications occurred in 7.4% (16 of 216) of the procedures with stents versus 3.8% (42 of 1109) in the procedures without stents (logistic regression P=0.644; OR: 1.289; 95% CI: 0.439 to 3.779). Procedure-induced mortality occurred in 4.6% (10 of 216) of the procedures with stents versus 1.2% (13 of 1109) in the procedures without stents (logistic regression P=0.006; OR: 0.116; 95% CI: 0.025 to 0.531). A total of 52.7% (114 of 216) of aneurysms treated with stents have been followed so far versus 69.8% (774 of 1109) of aneurysms treated without stents, disclosing angiographic recurrence in 14.9% (17 of 114) versus 33.5% (259 of 774), respectively (Fisher exact test P<0.0001; OR: 0.3485; 95% CI: 0.2038 to 0.5960). Stents were associated with a significant decrease of angiographic recurrences, but they were associated with more lethal complications compared with coiling without stents.

Fishing for Effective Conservation: Context and Biotic Variation are Keys to Understanding the Survival of Pacific Salmon after Catch-and-Release. Acute stressors are commonly experienced by wild animals but their effects on fitness rarely are studied in the natural environment. Billions of fish are captured and released annually around the globe across all fishing sectors (e.g., recreational, commercial, subsistence). Whatever the motivation, release often occurs under the assumption of post-release survival. Yet, capture by fisheries (hereafter "fisheries-capture") is likely the most severe acute stressor experienced in the animal's lifetime, which makes the problem of physiological recovery and survival of relevance to biology and conservation. Indeed, fisheries managers require accurate estimates of mortality to better account for total mortality from fishing, while fishers desire guidance on strategies for reducing mortality and maintaining the welfare of released fish, to maximize current and future opportunities for fishing. In partnership with stakeholders, our team has extensively studied the effects of catch-and-release on Pacific salmon in both marine and freshwater environments, using biotelemetry and physiological assessments in a combined laboratory-based and field-based approach. The emergent theme is that post-release rates of mortality are consistently context-specific and can be affected by a suite of interacting biotic and abiotic factors. The fishing gear used, location of a fishery, water temperature, and handling techniques employed by fishers each can dramatically affect survival of the salmon they release. Variation among individuals, co-migrating populations, and between sexes all seem to play a role in the response of fish to capture and in their subsequent survival, potentially driven by pre-capture pathogen-load, maturation states, and inter-individual variation in responsiveness to stress. Although some of these findings are fascinating from a biological perspective, they all create unresolved challenges for managers. We summarize our findings by highlighting the patterns that have emerged most consistently, and point to areas of uncertainty that require further research. 

The social world of Australian practice nurses and the influence of medical dominance: an analysis of the literature. In Australia, the number of practice nurses is growing at a rapid rate. On the nursing landscape, this group of nurses stand out because of their relationship with the Australian Government who both fund them, and concern themselves with their continuing professional development. This paper provides a construction of the social world of Australian practice nurses, identifying stakeholders in the business of practice nursing. Literature produced by the various social world segments is analysed for the influence of medical dominance on the role, image, power and politics of practice nurses.

Osteoblastoma characterized by a three-way translocation: report of a case and review of the literature. Osteoblastoma, an uncommon primary bone tumor, produces both osteoid and primitive woven bone in a background of fibrovascular connective tissue. Although most osteoblastomas are considered benign, a controversial aggressive variant has been described, which may cause diagnostic confusion with malignant tumors such as osteosarcoma. To date, no specific diagnostic cytogenetic or molecular marker has been identified for osteoblastoma to aid in its distinction. Conventional cytogenetic analysis of an osteoblastoma arising in the femur of a 23-year-old woman revealed a novel three-way translocation involving chromosomes 1, 2 and 14 [t(1;2;14) (q42;q13;q24)]. Rearrangement of 1q42 has been identified in a previously reported case.

Radiation-related treatment effects across the age spectrum: differences and similarities or what the old and young can learn from each other. Radiation related effects in children and adults limit the delivery of effective radiation doses and result in long-term morbidity affecting function and quality of life. Improvements in our understanding of the etiology and biology of these effects, including the influence of clinical variables, dosimetric factors, and the underlying biological processes have made treatment safer and more efficacious. However, the approach to studying and understanding these effects differs between children and adults. Using the pulmonary and skeletal organ systems as examples, comparisons are made across the age spectrum for radiation related effects, including pneumonitis, pulmonary fibrosis, osteonecrosis, and fracture. Methods for dosimetric analysis, incorporation of imaging and biology as well a length of follow-up are compared, contrasted, and discussed for both organ systems in children and adults. Better understanding of each age specific approach and how it differs may improve our ability to study late effects of radiation across the ages.

Risk factors for endometritis after low transverse cesarean delivery. To determine independent risk factors for endometritis after low transverse cesarean delivery. We performed a retrospective case-control study during the period from July 1999 through June 2001 in a large tertiary care academic hospital. Endometritis was defined as fever beginning more than 24 hours or continuing for at least 24 hours after delivery plus fundal tenderness in the absence of other causes for fever. Independent risk factors for endometritis were determined by means of multivariable logistic regression. A fractional polynomial method was used to examine risk of endometritis associated with the continuous variable, duration of rupture of membranes. Endometritis was identified in 124 (7.7%) of 1,605 women within 30 days after low transverse cesarean delivery. Independent risk factors for endometritis included age (odds ratio [OR] for each additional year, 0.93 [corrected] [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.90-0.97]) and anemia or perioperative blood transfusion (OR, 2.18 [CI, 1.30-3.68]). Risk of endometritis was marginally associated with a proxy for low socioeconomic status, lack of private health insurance (OR, 1.72 [CI, 0.99-3.00]); with amniotomy (OR, 1.69 [CI, 0.97-2.95]); and with longer duration of rupture of membranes. Risk of endometritis was independently associated with younger age and anemia and was marginally associated with lack of private health insurance and amniotomy. The odds of endometritis increased approximately 1.7-fold within 1 hour after rupture of membranes, but increased duration of rupture was only marginally associated with increased risk. Knowledge of these risk factors can guide selective use of prophylactic antibiotics during labor and heighten awareness of the risk in subgroups at highest risk of infection.

Measuring neuromuscular fatigue in cervical spinal musculature of military helicopter aircrew. Neck pain and muscle function in aircrew have received considerable attention. We hypothesized normalized electromyography (EMG) frequency would provide insight into appropriate methods to assess muscle fatigue in helicopter aircrew. 40 helicopter aircrew performed isometric testing that included maximal voluntary contractions (MVC) and 70% MVC endurance protocols of extension, flexion, and left and right lateral flexion for cervical muscles. Bilateral muscle activity in the splenius capitis, sternocleidomastoid, and upper trapezius was monitored with EMG. Normalized mean EMG frequency was calculated for each muscle at the start and end of the 70% MVC trials to determine which muscles fatigued and limited force maintenance during each isometric movement. For extension, the left and right splenius capitis fatigued by approximately 21-22% (p < 0.01); for flexion, the left and right sternocleidomastoid fatigued by approximately 11-14% (p < 0.01); for right flexion, the right sternocleidomastoid fatigued by approximately 15% (p < 0.01); for left flexion, the left spenus capitis and left sternocleidomastoid fatigued by approximately 7.2% (p = 0.02) and approximately 11.2% (p = 0.03), respectively; in no trials did the trapezius muscles display fatigue as measured by EMG. The smaller agonist muscles were the most susceptible to fatigue during submaximal isometric endurance movements in the cervical muscles of helicopter aircrew.

Effect of bleaching on ethyl glucuronide in hair: an in vitro experiment. Ethyl glucuronide in hair (HEtG) has recently gained great attention, because of its high sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of chronic alcohol abuse. Due to its high polarity hydrophilicity, a strong hair treatment followed by a shampooing may lead to removal/degradation of this molecule from hair matrix. To set up an in vitro study in order to evaluate the ability of bleaching of modifying HEtG test results. Thirty hair samples from teetotalers (n=5), social drinkers (n=4) and heavy drinkers (n=21), after an informed written consent, were collected and divided longitudinally into four aliquots. The first aliquot was kept untreated and was processed following the method routinely used in our lab for the determination of HEtG (double washing with methanol/dichloromethane, overnight incubation in water, and LC-MS/MS analysis, LLOQ: 3pg/mg). To the other three aliquots a commercially available bleaching solution was applied, according to the manufacturer's instructions. One out of the three aliquots was submitted to the analysis by following the same procedure used for the untreated sample. The other two were submitted to a purification step before LC-MS/MS analysis, by using two different SPE cartridges (aminopropyl and dimethyl butylamine). HEtG levels in the untreated samples from social drinkers and heavy drinkers ranged from 7.7 to 149.0pg/mg. All the samples from teetotalers tested negative. The treated samples processed without any SPE extraction and with aminopropyl cartridges showed a relevant ion suppression for both EtG and D(5)-EtG (IS) signals. Samples treated with the bleaching solution and extracted with dimethyl butylamine cartridge allowed to sensitively reduce ion suppression (less than 35%) and to verify that EtG, after a strong treatment like bleaching, completely disappears. This in vitro study showed that HEtG disappears from hair matrix after a strong hair treatment. It is not clear whether the mechanism involved is chemical degradation or physical removal from the damaged keratinic matrix. However, owing to the highly hydrophilic character of the compound, the second mechanism seems more likely to occur. Finally, bleaching solutions could lead to a heavy ion suppression of this metabolite that may be avoided by using an SPE purification before instrumental analysis.

Ventilator-induced diaphragmatic dysfunction.

Aging and spatial navigation: what do we know and where do we go? Spatial navigation is a complex cognitive skill that is necessary for everyday functioning in the environment. However, navigational skills are not typically measured in most test batteries assessing cognitive aging. The present paper reviews what we know about behavioral differences between older and younger adults in navigational skill and reviews the putative neural mechanisms that may underlie these behavioral differences. Empirical studies to date clearly identify navigation as an aspect of cognitive function that is vulnerable to the aging process. The few functional and structural neuroimaging studies that speak to neurological correlates of these age-related differences point to the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, posterior cingulate gyrus (retrosplenial cortex), parietal lobes and pre-frontal cortex as structures critically involved in age effects on navigation. Outstanding issues in the field are addressed and productive avenues of future research are suggested. Among these outstanding issues include the necessity of performing longitudinal studies and differentiating between hippocampal and extra-hippocampal contributions to aging in navigation. The field may also be advanced by empirical assessment of navigational strategies and investigations into the multisensory nature of navigation including assessing the relative contributions of visual, vestibular, and proprioceptive function to age differences in navigational skill.

The oral case presentation: toward a performance-based rhetorical model for teaching and learning. The oral case presentation is an important communicative activity in the teaching and assessment of students. Despite its importance, not much attention has been paid to providing support for teachers to teach this difficult task to medical students who are novices to this form of communication. As a formalized piece of talk that takes a regularized form and used for a specific communicative goal, the case presentation is regarded as a rhetorical activity and awareness of its rhetorical and linguistic characteristics should be given due consideration in teaching. This paper reviews practitioners' and the limited research literature that relates to expectations of medical educators about what makes a good case presentation, and explains the rhetorical aspect of the activity. It is found there is currently a lack of a comprehensive model of the case presentation that projects the rhetorical and linguistic skills needed to produce and deliver a good presentation. Attempts to describe the structure of the case presentation have used predominantly opinion-based methodologies. In this paper, I argue for a performance-based model that would not only allow a description of the rhetorical structure of the oral case presentation, but also enable a systematic examination of the tacit genre knowledge that differentiates the expert from the novice. Such a model will be a useful resource for medical educators to provide more structured feedback and teaching support to medical students in learning this important genre. 

High glucose increases expression of cyclooxygenase-2, increases oxidative stress and decreases the generation of nitric oxide in mouse microvessel endothelial cells. Hyperglycaemia is a key factor that contributes to the development of diabetes-related microvascular disease. Both cyclooxygenase I and cyclooxygenase II are expressed in endothelial cells and play key roles in the regulation of cardiovascular function. In the current study we tested the hypothesis that hyperglycaemia-induced increased expression of cyclooxygenase II is a contributing factor both to the increased oxidative stress and to the reduction in the generation of nitric oxide in microvessel endothelial cells following their exposure to high glucose. We demonstrated that the exposure of mouse microvascular endothelial cells to high glucose for 3 days decreased the generation of nitric oxide and enhanced production of superoxide. Western blots illustrated that exposure to high glucose also increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase II protein expression levels and decreased the dimer/monomer ratio of endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein. All the changes induced by the high glucose culture media could be reversed by either the cyclooxygenase II inhibitor CAY10404, the non-selective cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or the protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine, but not solely by preincubation with the antioxidant and putative NADPH oxidase inhibitor, apocynin. Our data indicate that high glucose induced oxidative stress is linked to an increase in the expression of cyclooxygenase II and a reduced generation of nitric oxide that is associated with an uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase, possibly due to decreased dimer/monomer ratio.

[Clinic peculiarities of secondary flexion contractur formation in the proximal interphalangeal joint of the triphalanger fingers in conditions of posttraumatic chronic ischemia]. Occurrence of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints contracture is a characteristic consequence of traumas of a forearm and a hand, complicated by the phenomena of a chronic ischemia. Their formation leads to occurrence of considerable functional deficiency of a hand, especially at involving in process of several fingers, and treatment is a complicated problem. Secondary contractures of PIP joints at a chronic ischemia of a hand and fingers differ high severity level, firmness, are characterized by fast formation and progressing. Elimination of the primary factor of blocking of a kinematic chain at a chronic ischemia of a hand and fingers does not render influence on reduction secondary contractures of PIP joints and leads to necessity of performance of additional surgery.

Randomized Trial of Rapid Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction-Based Blood Culture Identification and Susceptibility Testing. The value of rapid, panel-based molecular diagnostics for positive blood culture bottles (BCBs) has not been rigorously assessed. We performed a prospective randomized controlled trial evaluating outcomes associated with rapid multiplex PCR (rmPCR) detection of bacteria, fungi, and resistance genes directly from positive BCBs. A total of 617 patients with positive BCBs underwent stratified randomization into 3 arms: standard BCB processing (control, n = 207), rmPCR reported with templated comments (rmPCR, n = 198), or rmPCR reported with templated comments and real-time audit and feedback of antimicrobial orders by an antimicrobial stewardship team (rmPCR/AS, n = 212). The primary outcome was antimicrobial therapy duration. Secondary outcomes were time to antimicrobial de-escalation or escalation, length of stay (LOS), mortality, and cost. Time from BCB Gram stain to microorganism identification was shorter in the intervention group (1.3 hours) vs control (22.3 hours) (P < .001). Compared to the control group, both intervention groups had decreased broad-spectrum piperacillin-tazobactam (control 56 hours, rmPCR 44 hours, rmPCR/AS 45 hours; P = .01) and increased narrow-spectrum Î²-lactam (control 42 hours, rmPCR 71 hours, rmPCR/AS 85 hours; P = .04) use, and less treatment of contaminants (control 25%, rmPCR 11%, rmPCR/AS 8%; P = .015). Time from Gram stain to appropriate antimicrobial de-escalation or escalation was shortest in the rmPCR/AS group (de-escalation: rmPCR/AS 21 hours, control 34 hours, rmPCR 38 hours, P < .001; escalation: rmPCR/AS 5 hours, control 24 hours, rmPCR 6 hours, P = .04). Groups did not differ in mortality, LOS, or cost. rmPCR reported with templated comments reduced treatment of contaminants and use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials. Addition of antimicrobial stewardship enhanced antimicrobial de-escalation. NCT01898208.

Combination of heparin and aspirin is superior to aspirin alone in enhancing live births in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss and positive anti-phospholipid antibodies: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials and meta-regression. The combination of heparin and aspirin was regarded as the 'standard therapy' for patients with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and positive aPL antibodies to enhance live births, but it largely stems from expert opinion. We performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess whether this combination works better than aspirin alone. RCTs testing the efficacy of a combination of heparin and aspirin vs aspirin alone in patients with RPL and positive aPL antibodies were identified in electronic databases. Random effect meta-analysis was employed to pool relative risks (RRs) (with 95% CI) of live births as the primary outcome. RRs of obstetrical complications and standardized mean difference of birth weight were the secondary outcomes. Mixed-effects meta-regression was performed to identify factors associated with live births. Data from five trials involving 334 patients were analysed. The overall live birth rates were 74.27 and 55.83% in the combination and aspirin alone groups, respectively. Patients who received heparin and aspirin had significantly higher live birth rate (RR 1.301; 95% CI 1.040, 1.629) than aspirin alone, with the number needed to achieve one live birth being 5.6. No significant differences in pre-eclampsia, preterm labour and birth weight were found between both the groups. Meta-regression using age at randomization, previous history of live births and episodes of miscarriages as covariates failed to predict the RR of live birth. The combination of heparin and aspirin is superior to aspirin alone in achieving more live births in patients with positive aPL antibodies and RPL.

Long-term outcome of endovascular intervention in hepatic venous outflow obstruction following pediatric liver transplantation. The purpose of our study was to address the long-term outcome of angioplasty and stent placement for hepatic venous outflow obstruction following pediatric liver transplantation. From October 1999 to December 2011, 20 stenotic lesions were confirmed to constitute hepatic venous outflow obstruction in 18 pediatric patients (13 boys, 5 girls) among 152 pediatric patients following liver transplantation and were managed with endovascular intervention. Stent placement was favored over additional angioplasty in patients of preadolescent or adolescent age (>8 years old), after 1 or 2 sessions of balloon angioplasty. The primary patency and assisted primary patency were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A total of 32 procedures (24 balloon angioplasties, 8 stent placements) were conducted. The technical success rate was 90.6% (29/32). Clinical success was achieved in 15 of 18 patients (clinical success rate of 83.3%). Major complications did not occur in our study. Median follow-up was 91.5 months (interquartile range, 54.7-137.3 months) for the 18 patients. The 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year primary patencies of the 20 treated lesions were 63.5%, 57.8%, 57.8%, and 57.8%, respectively. The 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year assisted-primary patencies of the lesions were 100%, 100%, 100%, and 100%, respectively. Of the 6 patients of preadolescent or adolescent age, 5 patients underwent stent placement procedures, and the stents were patent during the follow-up period of 57.3-162.5 months (median, 72.7 months). In conclusion, endovascular intervention is very effective in hepatic venous outflow obstruction following pediatric liver transplantation. In addition, early stent placement in patients of preadolescent or adolescent age can provide a safe and favorable long-term outcome.

Estimating the integrity of aged DNA samples by CE. A CE/UV method was developed to separate by a micellar system the four DNA bases and other five purinic-pyrimidinic compounds (5-methyl-cytosine, uracil, xanthyne, hypoxanthyne and 5-bromo-uracil). Selectivity, precision, accuracy and sensitivity were assessed and proved to be suitable for the analysis of the primary structure of DNA. This method was adopted to study 16 aged samples including two Egyptian mummies, formaldehyde-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues and other forensic specimens. Lower relative values of the four canonical unmodified DNA bases (uDNAb) and more complex pherograms were found in the aged samples when compared with the modern controls. The results of the CE analysis, together with those obtained by classical molecular methods (agarose gel electrophoresis, DNase I and RNase A assays, and UV spectrophotometry), were finally evaluated for assessing the reliability of STR typing. Since samples with low uDNAb showed no amplification or unreliable STR profiles, the uDNAb value is discussed as a further quality criterion in the evaluation of the genetic data obtained from aged samples.

Angiotensin II promotes an osteoblast-like phenotype in porcine aortic valve myofibroblasts.

Expression and function of Toll-like receptors in human endometrial epithelial cell lines. In mammals, Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are the principal family of innate immune pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). The main function for TLRs is the detection of molecular patterns associated with invading pathogens. We investigated TLR expression and function in three established human endometrial epithelial cell lines, including hTERT-EEC, HEC-1B and Ishikawa cells, and clarified the application of these endometrial cell lines as in vitro models for studying TLR expression and function in the female reproductive tract. TLR gene expression was examined by RT-PCR and protein localization by immunohistochemistry. Our results showed that TLR expression in these cell lines is comparable to published literature on TLR expression in primary human endometrial tissue. TLR function was investigated by the detection of IL-6 and IL-8 production by ELISA in response to TLR2, TLR3, TLR5, TLR7 and TLR9 ligands. We found that hTERT-EEC cells were responsive to TLR5 ligand and HEC-1B cells respond to TLR3 and TLR5 ligands. In contrast, Ishikawa cells respond only to PMA/I which was used as a positive control for IL-8 production. Finally, we investigated the influence of flagellin as a TLR5 stimulant on TLR5 expression in these cell lines by QPCR. Our results showed that the endometrial cell lines showed a tendency for increased TLR5 expression in response to flagellin stimulation and in hTERT-EEC cells this tendency was statistically significant. These results suggest that hTERT-EEC, HEC-1B and Ishikawa cell lines can be used as in vitro models to investigate innate immune responses of endometrial cells in the female reproductive tract.

Food safety and food labeling from the viewpoint of the consumers. Distrust of food safety has grown among the Japanese people after the occurrence of bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE) in 2001. The Food Safety Commission was formed under the Cabinet Office and made a network among the ministries. The newly-established Consumer Agency may strengthen the quick response to emergencies. Shoku-iku (food and dietary education) Law is being implemented by the Cabinet Office with cooperation from relevant ministries and NGOs. Food Sanitation Law and Health Promotion Law are briefly explained, and the necessity of functional nutriology for non-nutrient biologically active substances is described. With regard to public health nutrition, a new food label showing energy balance and antioxidant unit (AOU) as a surrogate marker of fruit and vegetables has been developed for tailor-made nutrition which makes it easy to for individuals to control energy intake.

[Comparative study of one stage bilateral total knee arthroplasty with or without drainage]. To compare the impact of rehabilitative process of placing drainage versus no drainage during total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A prospective study was performed in 30 osteoarthritic patients who underwent one-stage bilateral TKA between October 2007 and December 2008. For every patient, drainage was randomly placed intra-operatively only on one knee side. Pain VAS scores, extremity swelling, incision healing, recovery of knee joint flexion and extension function and early postoperative complications were compared statistically as a self-control study. All patients were followed up for at least one month. Comparing drainage side with non-drainage side, the mean pain VAS scores at Day 3 post-operation were 4.7 +/- 1.8 and 4. 9 +/- 1.9 respectively; the mean extremity swelling differences of supra patellar (infra patellar) perimeter at Day 6 post-operation were 1.8 +/- 1.7 (0.7 +/- 1.0) cm and 1.7 +/- 1.3 (1.0 +/- 1.0) cm respectively; the mean flexion (extension) differences at Day 30 post-operation were 12.5 +/- 21.6 (4.4 +/- 6.9) degrees and 11.7 +/- 23.9 (4.2 +/- 6.4) degrees respectively. There was no obvious statistical difference between placing drainage and no drainage in all the above aspects (paired t-test, P > 0.05). There was also no statistical difference of early postoperative complications between two groups (exact Fisher test, P > 0.05). For unsophisticated TKA, placing drainage had no effect upon reducing the pain, extremity swelling and incision exudation. It also had no effect upon reducing the incidence of hematoma to prevent early infections and promoting rehabilitation. Comparing with no drainage, placing drainage had no obvious advantage. On the contrary, it might complicate the surgical steps and increase the chances of post-operative hemorrhage and retrograde infections. Thus no drainage is recommended in such a kind of operation.

Validating pathophysiological models of aging using clinical electronic medical records. Bioinformatics methods that leverage the vast amounts of clinical data promises to provide insights into underlying molecular mechanisms that help explain human physiological processes. One of these processes is adolescent development. The utility of predictive aging models generated from cross-sectional cohorts and their applicability to separate populations, including the clinical population, has yet to be completely explored. In order to address this, we built regression models predictive of adolescent chronological age from 2001 to 2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data and validated them against independent 2003-2004 NHANES data and clinical data from an academic tertiary-care pediatric hospital. The results indicate distinct differences between male and female models with both alkaline phosphatase and creatinine as predictive biomarkers for both genders, hematocrit and mean cell volume for males, and total serum globulin for females. We also suggest that the models are generalizable, are clinically relevant, and imply underlying molecular and clinical differences between males and females that may affect prediction accuracy. The integration of both epidemiological and clinical data promises to create more robust models that shed new light on physiological processes.


Assessing the effect of vibrotactile feedback during continuous multidirectional platform motion: a frequency domain approach.

Early evidence of increased risk for metabolic syndrome in young men with latent obstructive sleep apnea. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by a repetitive collapse of the upper airway during sleep and may affect as many as 1 in 5 adults. Although OSA appears to increase risk for metabolic syndrome in middle-aged adults, no data currently exist in a younger, preclinical cohort. Forty-five sedentary young men: 12 overweight with OSA (OSA), 18 overweight without OSA (NOSA), and 15 normal-weight without OSA (CON). Respiratory distress index (RDI) was determined using an at-home, unsupervised, portable polygraphy device. Total and subcutaneous abdominal fat (SAF) were quantified using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Blood pressure was obtained manually via auscultation. Fasting triglycerides, glucose, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations were analyzed from whole blood using a commercial lipid profile kit. The OSA group had 25% more SAF than the NOSA group (P < 0.05) and higher triglycerides (136.7 +/- 21.3 mg/dL versus 92.2 +/- 7.5, P < 0.05). RDI was directly related to fasting triglycerides (R = 0.32, P < 0.05) after controlling for SAF. The number of metabolic syndrome components was directly correlated to indices of adiposity, but not RDI. Using multiple linear regression analysis, triglycerides were the only independent predictor of RDI. Results from this study demonstrate that unique physiologic and anthropometric abnormalities exist in young men with occult OSA, beyond those that are seen in uncomplicated obesity. These findings may indicate early pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome in these young men.

Cavernous hemangioma of the skull: surgical treatment without craniectomy. The authors report the case of a large cranial cavernous hemangioma that was treated using embolization and craniotomy with preservation of the outer cranial table. A 3-year follow-up demonstrated no recurrence. Results in this case suggest that cavernous hemangiomas of the cranium may be safely and effectively treated without craniectomy in some cases.

Masseter muscle reattachment after mandibular angle surgery. Altering the dimensions of the mandibular angle by alloplastic augmentation or skeletal reduction requires elevation of the insertion of the masseter muscle, including the pterygomasseteric sling. Disruption of the pterygomasseteric sling during exposure of the inferior border of the mandible can cause the masseter muscle to retract superiorly, resulting in a loss of soft tissue volume over the angle of the mandible and a skeletonized appearance. Subsequent contraction of the masseter elevates the disinserted edge of the muscle and not only increases the skeletonized area, but also exaggerates the deficiency by causing a soft tissue bulge above it. The authors describe the disinsertion of the masseter and the resulting deformity as a potential complication of mandibular angle surgery and review the technique for repair. The records of 60 patients (44 primary, 16 secondary) who presented for alloplastic mandible augmentation between 2003 and 2008 were reviewed. Nine patients presented with clinical signs of disruption of the pterygomasseteric sling after mandibular angle surgery. Five patients had clinical signs consistent with complete disruption. Two of these patients requested reconstruction. The other four had signs consistent with partial disruption. Through a Risdon approach, the masseter was successfully reinserted using drill holes placed at the inferior border of the mandible. Masseter disinsertion is a previously unreported sequelae after aesthetic surgery for the angle of the mandible. The resultant static and dynamic contour deformity can be corrected by reattaching the muscle to the inferior border of the mandible.


Nocturnal intermittent hypoxia and the development of type 2 diabetes: the Circulatory Risk in Communities Study (CIRCS).

AtnMat2, a nuclear-encoded maturase required for splicing of group-II introns in Arabidopsis mitochondria. Mitochondria (mt) in plants house about 20 group-II introns, which lie within protein-coding genes required in both organellar genome expression and respiration activities. While in nonplant systems the splicing of group-II introns is mediated by proteins encoded within the introns themselves (known as "maturases"), only a single maturase ORF (matR) has retained in the mitochondrial genomes in plants; however, its putative role(s) in the splicing of organellar introns is yet to be established. Clues to other proteins are scarce, but these are likely encoded within the nucleus as there are no obvious candidates among the remaining ORFs within the mtDNA. Intriguingly, higher plants genomes contain four maturase-related genes, which exist in the nucleus as self-standing ORFs, out of the context of their evolutionary-related group-II introns "hosts." These are all predicted to reside within mitochondria and may therefore act "in-trans" in the splicing of organellar-encoded introns. Here, we analyzed the intracellular locations of the four nuclear-encoded maturases in Arabidopsis and established the roles of one of these genes, At5g46920 (AtnMat2), in the splicing of several mitochondrial introns, including the single intron within cox2, nad1 intron2, and nad7 intron2.

Determinants of adherence to evidence-based therapy after acute myocardial infarction. The extent to which drug adherence may be affected by patient characteristics remains unclear. This study investigated potential determinants of adherence to evidence-based cardioprotective medications in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Patient-based retrospective cohort study of 4655 elderly one-year survivors of acute myocardial infarction, members of a health organization in Israel, between 2005 and 2010. All patients filled at least one prescription for any key medication. Adherence was measured using the proportion-of-days-covered (PDC) metric and defined as PDCââ¥â80%. Nonadherence to aspirin, Î²-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers or statins approximated 50%, and 80% for combined therapy of all medications. In multivariable analyses, compared with nonadherents to all medications, adherers to at least one medication were more likely to be of Jewish origin (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 2.11; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.60-2.78), inhabitants of the central or northern districts, and attending a cardiologist at least once during the first year of follow-up (AOR, 1.26; 95% CI, 1.05-1.51). Increasing number of outpatient visits was associated with improved adherence and followed a significant dose-response gradient. Factors significantly associated with reduced adherence were presence of comorbid conditions, particularly chronic ischemic heart disease (AOR 0.69; 95% CI, 0.57-0.83) and readmissions (AOR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.55-0.78). Results were consistent when evaluating adherence to each medication separately. Outpatient adherence to recommended therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction is suboptimal and is related to health services utilization. Further research is needed to investigate patient subjective behavioral-related drivers for medication therapy discontinuation after myocardial infarction in the absence of a clinical reason.

Farm-to-fork characterization of Escherichia coli associated with feedlot cattle with a known history of antimicrobial use. This study investigated antimicrobial-resistant (AR) Escherichia coli isolated from "farm-to-fork" production of cattle fed diets containing the antimicrobial growth promoter (AGP) chlortetracycline plus sulfamethazine (44ppm each, AS700) or no AGP (control). For each treatment, samples included: feces just prior to euthanization; hides after euthanization; intestinal digesta from the lower digestive tract; carcasses immediately after evisceration and after 24h in the chiller; and ground beef stored at 5 degrees C for 1 and 8days. Samples were also collected from the abattoir environment and from air during hide removal. Total, ampicillin (Amp(r))-, and tetracycline (Tet(r))-resistant E. coli were isolated on MacConkey agar or MacConkey agar containing ampicillin or tetracycline, respectively. Amp(r) and Tet(r)E. coli were isolated from the feces and hides of all cattle. Compared to the control, the prevalence of Amp(r) (26.5% vs. 7.9%) and Tet(r) (50.9% vs. 12.6%) E. coli was greater in feces from AS700 treated animals (P<0.05), but was similar between treatments for hide samples (P>0.05). The prevalence of carcass or ground beef contamination with AR E. coli was not different between treatments. Resistant E. coli were isolated from the abattoir environment after processing of both groups of cattle. Susceptibilities to 11 antimicrobials and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analyses were conducted on 360 Amp(r) and Tet(r)E. coli isolates. Twenty-five antibiogram profiles were detected, with isolates exhibiting resistance to up to 9 antimicrobials. Most (28.2%) Amp(r)E. coli were also resistant to streptomycin and tetracycline, whereas Tet(r)E. coli (53.5%) were mainly resistant to only tetracycline. Thirty one genotypes were detected by PFGE with most isolates from meat and environmental samples having similar genetic profiles to isolates from hides or digesta. These data demonstrate that antimicrobial-resistant E. coli can contaminate meat products during slaughter and enter the food chain regardless of whether or not cattle are administered AGP. The abundance of AR E. coli on the hides of animals is likely a key element for controlling end-product contamination.

Domain requirements and sequence specificity of DNA binding for the forkhead transcription factor FOXP3. The forkhead, winged-helix transcription factor FOXP3 is preferentially expressed in T regulatory (Treg) cells and is critical for their immunosuppressive function. Mutations that abolish FOXP3 function lead to systemic autoimmunity in mice and humans. However, the manner by which FOXP3 recognizes cognate DNA elements is unclear. Here we identify an in vitro optimized DNA sequence to assess FOXP3 DNA binding by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). The optimized sequence contains two tandem copies of a core DNA element resembling, but not identical to, the canonical forkhead (FKH) binding element. The tandem nature of this optimized FOXP3-binding oligonucleotide suggests a requirement for multimerization, and EMSA experiments confirm that both the DNA-binding FKH domain and an intact leucine-zipper domain, which mediates homo-multimerization of FOXP3, are required for DNA binding. These results establish a practical framework for understanding the molecular basis by which FOXP3 regulates gene transcription and programs Treg suppressive function.

[Association between CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells and serum transforming growth factor beta 1 in patients with chronic hepatitis B]. To investigate whether the CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells are associated with serum TGF beta 1 in patients with hepatitis B. Patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB), chronic asymptomatic carriers (AsC), normal subjects (NS) and the resolved from HBV infection (Resolved) were recruited in this study. Flow cytometric analysis was used to detect the frequency and phenotype of peripheral CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells, and Foxp3 gene expression were examined by real time PCR. Serum TGF beta 1 levels were measured by ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Patients with CHB or AsC exhibited significantly higher frequency of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells compared to healthy controls. CD4+CD25+ T cells derived from patients with CHB and AsC expressed higher level of Foxp3-mRNA. Furthermore, the frequency of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells was correlated with serum HBV DNA copy numbers in patients with CHB and AsC. Our results indicated that the serum TGF beta was increased in CHB and AsC patients compared to control patients, and that serum TGF beta was correlated with the expression of Foxp3-mRNA and the frequency of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in patients with CHB and AsC. The findings have important implication in the understanding of the role and mechanism of aberrant CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in the maintenance of chronicity in hepatitis B patients.

[Rivaroxaban versus standard of care in venous thromboembolism prevention following hip or knee arthroplasty in daily clinical practice (Spanish data from the international study XAMOS)]. To analyse the effectiveness and safety of rivaroxaban vs. standard treatment (ST) in the prevention of venous thromboembolism after hip or knee replacement in daily clinical practice in Spain. A sub-analysis of the Spanish data in the XAMOS international observational study that included patients>18 years who received 10mg o.d. rivaroxaban or ST. up to 3 months after surgery. incidence of symptomatic/asymptomatic thromboembolic events, bleeding, mortality, and other adverse events; use of health resources and satisfaction after hospital discharge. Of the total 801 patients included, 410 received rivaroxaban and 391 ST (64.7% heparin, 24.0% fondaparinux, 11% dabigatran). The incidence of symptomatic thromboembolic events and major bleeding was similar in both groups (0.2% vs. 0.8% wit ST and 0.7% vs. 1.3% with ST [EMA criteria]/0.0% vs. 0.3% with ST [RECORD criteria]). The adverse events incidence associated with the drug was significantly higher rivaroxaban (overall: 4.4% vs. 0.8% with ST, P=.001; serious: 1.5% vs. 0.0% with ST, P=.03). The rivaroxaban used less health resources after discharge, and the majority considered the tolerability as Â«very goodÂ« and the treatment as Â«very comfortableÂ». Rivaroxaban is at least as effective as ST in the prevention of venous thromboembolism prevention in daily clinical practice, with a similar incidence of haemorrhages. It provides greater satisfaction/comfort, and less health resources after discharge. These results should be interpreted taking into account the limitations inherent in observational studies.


Survival after recurrence in early-stage high-risk epithelial ovarian cancer: a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.

Double labeling of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridization (DOPE-FISH) improves signal intensity and increases rRNA accessibility. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with singly labeled rRNA-targeted oligonucleotide probes is widely applied for direct identification of microbes in the environment or in clinical specimens. Here we show that a replacement of singly labeled oligonucleotide probes with 5'-, 3'-doubly labeled probes at least doubles FISH signal intensity without causing specificity problems. Furthermore, Cy3-doubly labeled probes strongly increase in situ accessibility of rRNA target sites and thus provide more flexibility for probe design.

[Treating Late Life Depression with Antidepressants--A Summary of Recommendations in International Guidelines]. Late life depression is associated with severe health consequences, e.g. elevated risk of medical comorbidity and decreased quality of life. This paper summarizes the recommendations of the international guidelines on evidence-based pharmacological treatment of depression in late life in a systematic review. Pharmacological treatments for depression recommended by most of the guidelines, however, hardly address the issue of the possible side effects of antidepressants and other factors of multi-medication on the elderly. Different guidelines pay different degrees of attention to the specific group of geriatric patients. There is a lack of evidence-based treatment recommendation that takes into consideration the specific age-related issues of sensitivity to adverse effects or pharmacokinetic interaction. Further research is required to provide a database for more refined recommendations in guidelines.

Improved characterization of nod factors and genetically based variation in LysM Receptor domains identify amino acids expendable for nod factor recognition in Lotus spp. Formation of functional nodules is a complex process depending on host-microsymbiont compatibility in all developmental stages. This report uses the contrasting symbiotic phenotypes of Lotus japonicus and L. pedunculatus, inoculated with Mesorhizobium loti or the Bradyrhizobium sp. (Lotus), to investigate the role of Nod factor structure and Nod factor receptors (NFR) for rhizobial recognition, infection thread progression, and bacterial persistence within nodule cells. A key contribution was the use of 800 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry for Nod factor analysis. The Nod factor decorations at the nonreducing end differ between Bradyrhizobium sp. (Lotus) and M. loti, and the NFR1/NFR5 extracellular regions of L. pedunculatus and L. japonicus were found to vary in amino acid composition. Genetic transformation experiments using chimeric and wild-type receptors showed that both receptor variants recognize the structurally different Nod factors but the later symbiotic phenotype remained unchanged. These results highlight the importance of additional checkpoints during nitrogen-fixing symbiosis and define several amino acids in the LysM domains as expendable for perception of the two differentially carbamoylated Nod factors.

Correlation of genotypes for thiopurine methyltransferase and inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase with long-term clinical outcomes in Korean patients with inflammatory bowel diseases during treatment with thiopurine drugs. There is a lack of research describing the associations between thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT)/inosine triphosphate pyrophosphatase (ITPA) genotypes and long-term clinical outcomes. We investigated whether TPMT/ITPA genotypes predicted long-term clinical response in Korean patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) undergoing thiopurine treatment. A total of 204 patients with IBD in whom thiopurine treatment was indicated were enrolled and categorized by TPMT and ITPA genotypes. Long-term follow-up clinical data for these patients were analyzed with specific focus on disease relapse. Of the 204 patients, 162 (79.4%) patients using thiopurines achieved remission and were included in an analysis of long-term clinical outcomes. There were no significant differences in disease relapse-free survival between wild and mutant types of TPMT (P=0.903) or ITPA (P=0.392), according to the results of the log-rank analysis. Our study suggests that TPMT and ITPA genotypes may not affect the rates of disease relapse in IBD patients treated with thiopurines. Further studies are indicated to confirm the utility of TPMT/ITPA genotyping to guide clinicians formulating individualized treatments for IBD patients requiring thiopurine therapy.

Life review with older women: an intervention to reduce depression and improve autobiographical memory. As life expectancy rises worldwide and the population grows older, psychopathology in older adults becomes a significant public health concern and intervention methods acquire renewed importance. The aim of the present study was to assess the efficacy of Life Review as an intervention strategy in working with older women with depressive symptoms, specifically through promotion of the specificity of autobiographical memories. Twenty-two participants were randomly assigned to experimental or control conditions. Intervention consisted of four individual sessions of Life Review, structured along 14 questions aimed at prompting autobiographical memory specificity. Participants in the control condition did not receive intervention. Results indicated a significant change in the experimental group, appearing as the reduction of depressive symptoms (t(20)=3.58, p<0.05) and an increase in life satisfaction (t(20)=-3.83, p<0.05), as well as a significant increase in the specificity (t(20)=-3.46, p<0.05) and positivity (t(20)=-4.23, p<0.05) of autobiographical memories. All variables reached high effect sizes, with an effect size of r=0.64 regarding depressive symptoms. Results suggest that Life Review is a valuable tool for use with older adults, and that promotion of specific autobiographical memories is a mechanism through which the strategy attains its effectiveness.

Human herpesvirus 8 infection in HIV-1-infected and uninfected pregnant women in Ethiopia. Human Herpes Virus (HHV-8) is related to Kaposi Saracoma, an opportunistic infection occurring with HIV infection. Little is known about the seroepidemiology of Human Herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection among Ethiopian women, even though women are a major HIV risk group in Ethiopia. This study aimed at determining the seroprevalence of HHV-8 infection in HIV-1-infected and uninfected pregnant women in five selected regions of Ethiopia. A cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2006 to June 2007 where pregnant women were recruited after age-matching in groups. A total of 400 pregnant women were enrolled, with 200 being HIV-infected and 200 being HIV-uninfected Sera were screened for IgG lytic antibody to HHV-8 using an Indirect Fluorescence Assay (IFA) in Virology Unit of Ethiopian Health and Nutrition Research Institute (EHNR1). Of 400 pregnant women attending antenatal clinic (ANC) testing sites of five regions in Ethiopia, 212 (53.0%) were positive for HHV-8 IgG lytic antibody. There was a high prevalence of HHV-8 infection among HIV-1-infected pregnant women (138, 69.0%) as compared with HIV-1-uninfected pregnant women (74, 37.0%). The study shows a high prevalence of HHV-8 infection among HIV-1-infected pregnant women as compared with HIV-1-uninfected pregnant women. Therefore, creating awareness and educating women on safe sexual practice and avoiding deep kissing may be a fundamental ways to limit the roots of transmission. Moreover, initiating strong antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV infected women would be best treatment prior to the development of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS).

Nickel-quinolones interaction. Part 2--interaction of nickel(II) with the antibacterial drug oxolinic acid. The mononuclear nickel(II) complexes with the first-generation quinolone antibacterial agent oxolinic acid in the presence or absence of nitrogen-donor heterocyclic ligands (2,2'-bipyridine, 1,10-phenanthroline or pyridine) have been synthesized and characterized. The experimental data suggest that oxolinic acid acts as deprotonated bidentate ligand coordinated to Ni(II) ion through the ketone and carboxylato oxygens. The crystal structure of (2,2'-bipyridine)bis(oxolinato) nickel(II), 2 has been determined by X-ray crystallography. The cyclic voltammograms of the complexes recorded in dmso solution and in 1/2 dmso/buffer (containing 150mM NaCl and 15mM trisodium citrate at pH 7.0) solution have shown that in the presence of calf-thymus DNA (CT DNA) they can bind to CT DNA by the intercalative binding mode. UV study of the interaction of the complexes with CT DNA has shown that the complexes bind to CT DNA and bis(aqua)bis(oxolinato) nickel(II) exhibits the highest binding constant to CT DNA. Competitive study with ethidium bromide (EB) has shown that the complexes can displace the DNA-bound EB indicating that they bind to DNA in strong competition with EB. The complexes exhibit good binding propensity to human or bovine serum albumin protein having relatively high binding constant values.


Emergence of a new genetic lineage of Newcastle disease virus in West and Central Africa--implications for diagnosis and control.

Evidence for association of the TCF7 locus with type I diabetes. The Type I Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC) has collected thousands of multiplex and simplex families with type I diabetes (T1D) with the goal of identifying genes involved in T1D susceptibility. These families have been genotyped for the HLA class I and class II loci and, recently, for a genome-wide panel of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). In addition, multiple SNPs in specific candidate genes have been genotyped in these families in an attempt to evaluate previously reported T1D associations, including the C883A (Pro-Thr) polymorphism in exon 2 of TCF7, a T-cell transcription factor. The TCF7 883A allele was associated with T1D in subjects with T1D not carrying the high-risk HLA genotype DR3/DR4. A panel of 11 SNPs in TCF7 was genotyped in 2092 families from 9 cohorts of the T1DGC. SNPs at two positions in TCF7 were associated with T1D. One associated SNP, C883A (rs5742913), was reported earlier to have a T1D association. A second SNP, rs17653687, represents a novel T1D susceptibility allele in TCF7. After stratification on the high T1D risk DR3/DR4 genotype, the variant (A) allele of C883A was significantly associated with T1D among non-DR3/DR4 cases (transmission=55.8%, P=0.004; OR=1.26) but was not significantly associated in the DR3/DR4 patient subgroup, replicating the earlier report. The reference A allele of intronic SNP rs17653687 was modestly associated with T1D in both DR3/DR4 strata (transmission=54.4% in DR3/DR4; P=0.03; transmission=52.9% in non-DR3/DR4; P=0.03). These results support the previously reported association of the non-synonymous Pro-Thr SNP in TCF7 with T1D, and suggest that other alleles at this locus may also confer risk.

Aerobic carboxydotrophy under extremely haloalkaline conditions in Alkalispirillum/Alkalilimnicola strains isolated from soda lakes. Aerobic enrichments from soda lake sediments with CO as the only substrate resulted in the isolation of five bacterial strains capable of autotrophic growth with CO at extremely high pH and salinity. The strains belonged to the Alkalispirillum/Alkalilimnicola cluster in the Gammaproteobacteria, where the ability to oxidize CO, but not growth with CO, has been demonstrated previously. The growth with CO was possible only at an oxygen concentration below 5 % and CO concentration below 20 % in the gas phase. The isolates were also capable of growth with formate but not with H(2). The carboxydotrophic growth occurred within a narrow pH range from 8 to 10.5 (optimum at 9.5) and a broad salt concentration from 0.3 to 3.5 M total Na(+) (optimum at 1.0 M). Cells grown on CO had high respiration activity with CO and formate, while the cells grown on formate actively oxidized formate alone. In CO-grown cells, CO-dehydrogenase (CODH) activity was detectable both in soluble and membrane fractions, while the NAD-independent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) resided solely in membranes. The results of total protein profiling and the failure to detect CODH with conventional primers for the coxL gene indicated that the CO-oxidizing enzyme in haloalkaliphilic isolates might differ from the classical aerobic CODH complex. A single cbbL gene encoding the RuBisCO large subunit was detected in all strains, suggesting the presence of the Calvin cycle of inorganic carbon fixation. Overall, these results demonstrated the possibility of aerobic carboxydotrophy under extremely haloalkaline conditions.

Protein: A nutrient in focus. Protein is an essential component of a healthy diet and is a focus of research programs seeking to optimize health at all stages of life. The focus on protein as a nutrient often centers on its thermogenic and satiating effect, and when included as part of a healthy diet, its potential to preserve lean body mass. A growing body of literature, including stable isotope based studies and longer term dietary interventions, suggests that current dietary protein recommendations may not be sufficient to promote optimal muscle health in all populations. A protein intake moderately higher than current recommendations has been widely endorsed by many experts and working groups and may provide health benefits for aging populations. Further, consuming moderate amounts of high-quality protein at each meal may optimally stimulate 24-h muscle protein synthesis and may provide a dietary platform that favors the maintenance of muscle mass and function while promoting successful weight management in overweight and obese individuals. Dietary protein has the potential to serve as a key nutrient for many health outcomes and benefits might be increased when combined with adequate physical activity. Future studies should focus on confirming these health benefits from dietary protein with long-term randomized controlled studies.

Cryotherapy in the management of esophageal dysplasia and malignancy.

Free phenolic acids from the seaweed Halimeda monile with antioxidant effect protecting against liver injury. Phenolic compounds are found in seaweed species together with other substances presenting antioxidant activity. The objective of this work was to evaluate the antioxidant activity of the free phenolic acids (FPA) fraction from the seaweed Halimeda monile, and its activity to protect the expression of hepatic enzymes in rats, under experimental CCl4 injury. The antioxidant activity was measured by the DPPH method. The FPA fraction (80 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered during 20 consecutive days to rats. The peroxidation was performed by thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS). The SOD and CAT enzymatic expressions were measured by RT/PCR. The histology technique was used to evaluate liver injuries. The expression of both, CAT and SOD genes, was more preserved by FPA. Only partial injury could be observed by histology in the liver of rats receiving FPA as compared with the control group; and CCl4 administration induced 60% more peroxidation as compared with the rats receiving FPA. These data suggest that FPA could modulate the antioxidant enzymes and oxidative status in the liver through protection against adverse effects induced by chemical agents.

Chirality of organophosphorus pesticides: analysis and toxicity. Although the importance of chirality in organophosphorus compounds (OPs) is well recognized in relation to their biological effects, as with most chiral pesticides, OPs are generally marketed, used and released to the environment as racemates (i.e., equimolar mixtures of enantiomers). In addition, research on enantioselective environmental fate and effects of chiral OPs is still limited, particularly in the evaluation of enantioselectivity in their environmental degradation. A large number of OPs are chiral compounds, and yet enantioselectivity in their environmental fate and effects is rarely addressed. This paper highlights the current state of knowledge on the environmental occurrence and behavior of chiral OP pesticides. Developments in enantioselective analytical techniques, specifically gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis (CE), as applied in the evaluation of enantiomer-specific fate and effects of chiral OPs, are also discussed.

"Signet-ring" cells--a caveat in the diagnosis of a diffuse peritoneal mesothelioma occurring in a lady presenting with recurrent ascites: an unusual case report. A diffuse peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare tumor. Exfoliative cytology forms the first step in the diagnosis of mesothelioma, since most of these cases presented with effusion. Despite well established cytomorphological features, a challenge exists in differentiating mesothelial cells, including reactive and malignant types from carcinoma cells and macrophages. Presence of "signet-ring" cells increases the diagnostic challenge as these can be forms of benign and malignant cells. Ancillary techniques like immunohistochemical (IHC) markers and ultrastructural analysis form useful adjunct in substantiating exact diagnosis. We report an unusual case study of a diffuse peritoneal mesothelioma in a 57-years-old lady, with no history of asbestos exposure, presenting with recurrent ascites, diagnosed on ascitic fluid cytology and on histology as an adenocarcinoma, based upon the presence of "signet-ring" cells. On review, clinicopathological correlation with IHC was helpful in forming correct diagnosis.

Clearance systems in the brain-implications for Alzheimer disease. Accumulation of toxic protein aggregates-amyloid-Î² (AÎ²) plaques and hyperphosphorylated tau tangles-is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer disease (AD). AÎ² accumulation has been hypothesized to result from an imbalance between AÎ² production and clearance; indeed, AÎ² clearance seems to be impaired in both early and late forms of AD. To develop efficient strategies to slow down or halt AD, it is critical to understand how AÎ² is cleared from the brain. Extracellular AÎ² deposits can be removed from the brain by various clearance systems, most importantly, transport across the blood-brain barrier. Findings from the past few years suggest that astroglial-mediated interstitial fluid (ISF) bulk flow, known as the glymphatic system, might contribute to a larger portion of extracellular AÎ² (eAÎ²) clearance than previously thought. The meningeal lymphatic vessels, discovered in 2015, might provide another clearance route. Because these clearance systems act together to drive eAÎ² from the brain, any alteration to their function could contribute to AD. An understanding of AÎ² clearance might provide strategies to reduce excess AÎ² deposits and delay, or even prevent, disease onset. In this Review, we describe the clearance systems of the brain as they relate to proteins implicated in AD pathology, with the main focus on AÎ². 

Interferon in chronic myeloid leukaemia: past and future. Imatinib has revolutionized the therapy of chronic myeloid leukaemia. However the complete eradication of leukaemic stem cells is still a matter of discussion. Interferon (IFN) has been used in the past with success. However the proportion of patients who achieved sustained complete cytogenetic response was small. Recently, in addition to its direct antineoplastic effect and immunomodulatory activity, IFN has been shown to stimulate the quiescent leukaemic stem cells. Thus there is now a rational for combining Imatinib and IFN. Large prospective phase III trials are in good progress to demonstrate in humans the usefullness of a combination therapy using Imatinib and IFN.

The impact of societal changes on patterns of urolithiasis. The purpose of the present review is to track changes in prevalence and composition of stone disease as a result of lifestyle changes over the past century. Increasing rates of obesity, diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome have resulted in increasing rates of nephrolithiasis among women, decreasing the male-to-female ratio from 1.3: 1 to 1.7: 1. Urine composition results have revealed a decrease in urinary pH (<5.5) and an increase in urinary uric acid supersaturation. This has resulted in increased rates of uric acid stones. Modern bariatric surgeries have further increased the risk of calcium oxalate stone formation. Offending agents, intentionally or unintentionally added to food or drug products, have also led to the appearance of previously unrecognized stone types, that is, melamine and indinavir calculi. Societal changes have had a tremendous impact on stone prevalence and composition. Prompt healthier lifestyle education as well as tighter quality control in the Food and Drug Industry is paramount to reducing nephrolithiasis rates and its complications.

Expression of fractalkine receptor CX3CR1 on cochlear macrophages influences survival of hair cells following ototoxic injury. The role of innate immunity and macrophage recruitment to the inner ear after hair cell injury is a subject where little is known. In this paper, we demonstrate recruitment of monocytes and macrophages to the inner ear after kanamycin. We also examined the effect of fractalkine receptor (CX3CR1) deletion in kanamycin ototoxicity. We observed more functional and structural damage in CX3CR1 null mice compared to wild-type and heterozygous littermates. In order to determine if increased susceptibility to kanamycin resulted from CX3CR1 deletion from cochlear leukocytes, we created bone marrow chimeras by transplanting CX3CR1-null bone marrow into wild-type mice whose native bone marrow was ablated by lethal irradiation. These mice were then treated with kanamycin sulfate. Auditory brainstem responses (ABR), hair cell counts, and numbers of macrophages recruited to the cochlea were recorded in irradiated mice that received either wild-type, CX3CR1 heterozygous, or CX3CR1 knockout bone marrow. A strong correlation was present between numbers of macrophages and hair cell death in recipients transplanted with CX3CR1 null marrow. No correlation between macrophage number and hair cell loss was present in mice transplanted with wild-type or CX3CR1 heterozygous marrow. We suggest that CX3CR1 plays a role in modulating the detrimental effects of cochlear macrophages after kanamycin ototoxicity. Our data point to the possibility that CX3CR1-deficient cochlear macrophages exacerbate kanamycin ototoxicity while CX3CR1-expressing monocytes do not.

The OVLT initiates the fall in arterial pressure evoked by high dose lipopolysaccharide: evidence that dichotomous, dose-related mechanisms mediate endotoxic hypotension. This study tested the hypothesis that lipopolysaccharide (LPS) lowers arterial pressure through two different mechanisms depending on the dose. Previously, we found that a low hypotensive dose of LPS (1mg/kg) lowers arterial pressure by activating vagus nerve afferents. Here we report that hypotension evoked by high dose LPS (15mg/kg) can be prevented by injecting lidocaine into the OVLT but not by vagotomy or inactivation of the NTS. The hypotension produced by both LPS doses was correlated with elevated extracellular norepinephrine concentrations in the POA and prevented by blocking alpha-adrenergic receptors. Thus, initiation of endotoxic hypotension is dose-related, mechanistically.

Instantiating a mechatronic valve schedule for a hydrocephalus shunt. Hydrocephalus is caused by blockage or reabsorption difficulty that upsets the natural balance of production and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, resulting in a build-up of the fluid in the ventricles of the brain. One of the recent advances in the treatment of hydrocephalus is the invention of a mechatronic valve. The desirability of such valve lies in the potential of having shunt that not only control hydrocephalus but also seeks to treat it. In contrast to current valves, such a valve is regulated based on a time based schedule not on the differential pressure across the valve. Thus the effectiveness of such valve is highly dependant on selecting an appropriate valve schedule that delivers personal dynamic treatment for every individual patient. Providing such a schedule is likely to be one of the obstacles facing the implementation of the mechatronic valve. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to help in developing such a schedule that dynamically change based on the patients' own intracranial pressure data and a novel figure of merit, thus providing the physician with an easy tool that facilitate the use of the mechatronic valve. The algorithm was implemented in M ATLAB and Simulink. Real ICP data for three hydrocephalus patients (before shunting) were used to test this algorithm and the resulted schedules along with the resulted intracranial pressure data have illustrated the effectiveness of the algorithm in providing schedule that maintain ICP within the normal limits.

Survey on human papillomavirus/p16 screening use in oropharyngeal carcinoma patients in the United States. Patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma (OC) have better prognosis than patients with HPV-negative OC. The objective of the current study was to assess how different practices across the United States treat patients with OC with respect to screening for HPV DNA or p16. Five hundred forty-two randomly selected radiation oncologists were sent an 11-question survey by email regarding the use of HPV/p16 screening in OC. The questionnaire addressed demographics of the practice, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) use, screening practices for HPV DNA or p16, which year this began, the use of HPV or p16 data to direct patient care, and future plans for its use if it had not already been instituted. One hundred ninety-two responses (39.6%) were received. Thirty-five percent of respondents (67 of 188) reported screening for HPV DNA routinely, whereas 4.8% of respondents (9 of 188) reported screening for p16. Of the physicians who did not use screening techniques, 37.2% (44 of 118 respondents) reported future plans to institute these screening techniques, 20% (9 of 45 respondents) stated plans to institute these techniques in the next 6 months, 55.5% (25 of 45 respondents) stated plans to institute these techniques within 6 months to 1 year, and 22.2% (10 of 45 respondents) stated plans to institute these techniques within 1 to 2 years. Academic physicians were more likely to use screening techniques (62.7%; P < .001) compared with private practitioners (31.4%). Only 12.4% of respondents reported using HPV or p16 data to direct care. Approximately 40.4% of radiation oncology practices that responded to a survey in the United States screened for HPV DNA or p16 in OC, whereas only 12.4% used it to further direct care. This number appears to be growing rapidly. Clinical trials to further elucidate how HPV or p16 status should direct care in OC are warranted.

Exposure to social-evaluative video clips: Neural, facial-muscular, and experiential responses and the role of social anxiety. Engaging in social interaction often implies being evaluated. Receiving positive evaluations from others may elicit affiliative emotions whereas negative evaluations are likely to trigger withdrawal and defensive social behavior. Evolution has equipped humans with efficient systems to detect, appraise, and regulate responses to such evaluative communications and to express complementary responses. The current study investigates neural, facial-muscular, and experiential responses to short videos delivering neutral, positive, and negative audiovisual messages as well as their relation to individual differences in social anxiety. Fifty-eight participants (32 female) watched 90 videos with male and female actors displaying positive, negative, and neutral statements. Experientially, ratings of valence and arousal showed the expected category differences. Neurally, larger centro-parietal late positive event related potentials were found for emotional (positive and negative) videos compared to neutral videos. Facial electromyography revealed reduced corrugator muscle and increased zygomaticus major muscle activity for positive videos compared to neutral and negative videos. Cognitive components of social anxiety were related to a more unpleasant experience of negative videos and a less pleasant experience of positive videos. Thus, a set of neural, facial-muscular, and experiential responses contribute to social interaction in the context of relatively naturalistic social-evaluative stimuli.

Hepatitis B vaccine and uveitis: an emerging hypothesis suggested by review of 32 case reports.

A study of the effects of the aromatase inhibitors anastrozole   and letrozole on bone metabolism in postmenopausal women   with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. ALIQUOT (Anastrozole vs. Letrozole, an Investigation of Quality Of Life and Tolerability) was a prospective, open-label, randomized pharmacodynamic study designed to assess the effects of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) on bone turnover in healthy postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Ninety-four patients were randomized to receive either 12 weeks of letrozole (2.5 mg; n = 42) followed by 12 weeks of anastrozole (1 mg), or 12 weeks of anastrozole (1 mg; n = 42) followed by 12 weeks of letrozole (2.5 mg). After completion of the study period, patients in the immediate adjuvant group were either switched to tamoxifen (n = 38) or continued on anastrozole or letrozole. In the beginning of the study, 42 patients had taken tamoxifen within 3 months. Patients taking drugs likely to affect bone metabolism, including bisphosphonates, were excluded. Eighty-four patients had complete sample measurements and were included in the analysis. Prior tamoxifen therapy resulted in a significantly lower mean baseline procollagen type 1 N-terminal propeptide (PINP) compared with patients with no prior tamoxifen. There were no significant differences in bone markers between AIs at any time. By 6 months, significant increases were seen in PINP, C-terminal telopeptides (CTX), bone specific alkaline phosphatise (ALP), and urinary N-terminal telopeptides (NTX). Patients with prior tamoxifen had significantly greater increases than patients with no prior tamoxifen. Patients treated with 3 months of tamoxifen following 6 months of an AI showed a significant decrease in markers of bone resorption, serum CTX and urinary NTX. In conclusion, AI-induced bone turnover increases over time. Anastrozole and letrozole produce similar effects on bone metabolism and turnover. Stopping tamoxifen therapy and starting AIs results in a significantly greater increase in bone turnover compared with commencing AIs in tamoxifen-naÃ¯ve patients. Patients given tamoxifen following AI therapy showed a decrease in markers of bone resorption.

Peloruside B, a potent antitumor macrolide from the New Zealand marine sponge Mycale hentscheli: isolation, structure, total synthesis, and bioactivity. Peloruside B (2), a natural congener of peloruside A (1), was isolated in sub-milligram quantities from the New Zealand marine sponge Mycale hentscheli. Peloruside B promotes microtubule polymerization and arrests cells in the G(2)/M phase of mitosis similar to paclitaxel, and its bioactivity was comparable to that of peloruside A. NMR-directed isolation, structure elucidation, structure confirmation by total synthesis, and bioactivity of peloruside B are described in this article. The synthesis features Sharpless dihydroxylation, Brown's asymmetric allylboration reaction, reductive aldol coupling, Yamaguchi macrolactonization, and selective methylation.

Infratemporal hydatid cyst: a case presenting with blindness. We report a very rare case of a hydatid cyst in the infratemporal fossa, causing visual loss over a 10-day period, which disappeared with rapid surgical and medical treatment. A 14-year-old girl presented with right exophthalmos and visual loss. Over a 10-day period, her visual acuity had decreased to detection of hand motion only, due to pressure on the optic nerve caused by a parapharyngeal cyst pressing through a inferior orbital fissure on the right side. A craniotomy had previously been performed for a right frontoparietal hydatid cyst. The patient had been treated intermittently with albendazole. The patient was primarily diagnosed with hydatid cyst, on the basis of her previous medical history and radiological findings, and underwent surgery. Three cysts were carefully removed from the right maxillary sinus, via a standard Caldwell-Luc approach, and the surgical area was irrigated with hypertonic saline. Infratemporal hydatidosis is very rarely reported in the world literature, although hydatid cysts are endemic in many countries, including Iran. We discuss the common presenting features, investigation and treatment options for infratemporal hydatosis. Constant evaluation of adjacent organs is necessary, with treatment as required, due to the propensity of hydatidosis to recur in essential organs. Immediate surgery is recommended, both to prevent the development of disease and to improve the prognosis.


Diagnosis, management and therapeutic outcome in prepubertal Cushing's disease.

Effect of changes in left ventricular diastolic function during exercise on exercise tolerance assessed by exercise-stress tissue Doppler echocardiography. Cardiac function during exercise is assumed to be important in determining exercise tolerance. The aims of this study were to evaluate changes in left ventricular diastolic function (LVDF) during exercise and its effect on exercise tolerance assessed by a noninvasive method, exercise-stress tissue Doppler echocardiography. Twenty-six men with sinus rhythm (controls, hypertension, and cardiomyopathy) underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing. To assess LVDF during exercise, exercise-stress Doppler echocardiography was performed with a constant workload at rest, and at 50%, 100%, and 120% of anaerobic threshold (AT). Doppler variables related to LVDF increased significantly as the workload increased (P < 0.05). Resting E'correlated significantly with AT (r = 0.424, P = 0.0308) and peak VO(2) (r = 0.471, P = 0.0152). However, the difference in E'between rest and 120% AT (DeltaE') was closely correlated with AT (r = 0.744, P < 0.0001) and peak VO(2) (r = 0.748, P < 0.0001). Moreover, DeltaE'was correlated independently with AT (P = 0.0321) and peak VO(2) (P = 0.0192) by multiple regression analysis. These results suggest that the ability to increase LVDF during exercise is an important factor in determining exercise tolerance.

Self-referential processing and the prefrontal cortex over the course of depression: a pilot study.

Gene expression profiling identifies emerging oncogenic pathways operating in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. Biopsies and cell lines of natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (NKTCL) were subject to combined gene expression profiling and array-based comparative genomic hybridization analyses. Compared with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified, NKTCL had greater transcript levels for NK-cell and cytotoxic molecules, especially granzyme H. Compared with normal NKcells, tumors were closer to activated than resting cells and overexpressed several genes related to vascular biology, Epstein-Barr Virus-induced genes, and PDGFRA. Notably, platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha and its phosphorylated form were confirmed at the protein level, and in vitro the MEC04 NKTCL cell line was sensitive to imatinib. Deregulation of the AKT, Janus kinase-signal transducers and activators of transcription, and nuclear factor-kappaB pathways was corroborated by nuclear expression of phosphorylated AKT, signal transducers and activators of transcription 3, and RelA in NKTCL, and several deregulated genes in these pathways mapped to regions of recurrent copy number aberrations (AKT3 [1q44], IL6R [1q21.3], CCL2 [17q12], TNFRSF21 [6p12.3]). Several features of NKTCL uncovered by this analysis suggest perturbation of angiogenic pathways. Integrative analysis also evidenced deregulation of the tumor suppressor HACE1 in the frequently deleted 6q21 region. This study highlights emerging oncogenic pathways in NKTCL and identifies novel diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

Allelic frequency distribution of 17 STRs from Identifiler and PowerPlex-16 in Central Portugal area and the Azores archipelago. This study analyzes the allelic frequency distribution of 17 STRs contained in the AmpFlSTR Identifiler (Applied Biosystems) and PowerPlex16 System (Promega) commercial kits for two large population samples from the Azores archipelago (Portugal) (N=475) and from Central Portugal (N=2125). Likewise, it includes a comparative study among the population groups analyzed in this paper and those which history points out as originating from the first settlers of the Azores. All loci were highly polymorphic. The Central Portuguese area and the Azores archipelago population samples are in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium for the 17 markers analyzed.

Production of a recombinant alkane hydroxylase (AlkB2) from Alcanivorax borkumensis. Alcanivorax borkumensis is an oil-degrading marine bacterium. Its genome contains genes coding for three cytochrome P450s and two integral membrane alkane hydroxylases (AlkB1 & AlkB2), all assumed to perform hydroxylation of different linear or branched alkanes. Although, the sequence of alkB2 has been determined, the molecular characterization and the substrate specificity of AlkB2 require more precise investigation. In this study, AlkB2 from A. borkumensis SK2 was expressed in Escherichia coli to examine the functionality of AlkB2 as a hydroxylating enzyme. Furthermore, the activity of the enzyme in the presence of the accessory proteins, rubredoxin (RubA) and rubredoxin reductase (RubB), produced in E. coli BL21(DE3)plysS cells, was determined. Recombinant AlkB2 is produced in an active form and rubredoxin is the intermediate electron donor to AlkB2 and can replace AlkG function, when NADH is the prime electron donor.

Treatment of popliteal pterygium using an Ilizarov external fixator. Popliteal pterygium syndrome is a rare congenital disorder that consists of popliteal webs and craniofacial, genitourinary and extremity anomalies. Only moderate successful surgical excision of the fibrotic band within the popliteal web has been reported because the nerves and vessels in the affected site are short and displaced into the web and they are attached to adjacent tissues. We performed hamstring tenotomy on the ischial tuberosity, tenotomy of the flexor hallucis longus and Z-lengthening of the Achilles tendon on the ankle in our patient, and this was followed by gradual correction using an Ilizarov external fixator. Full extension of the knee joint was achieved at the ninth postoperative week. However, some recurrence of flexion contracture was noted at two years follow-up. Gradual soft tissue lengthening with an Ilizarov external fixator can be one of the optimal procedures when excision of a fibrous band and Z-plasty are not possible due to severe adhesion of the nerves and vessels into a fibrotic band. However, a cautious approach is recommended when considering the high risk of recurrence.

Boot-insole effects on comfort and plantar loading at the heel and fifth metatarsal during running and turning in soccer. Plantar loading may influence comfort, performance and injury risk in soccer boots. This study investigated the effect of cleat configuration and insole cushioning levels on perception of comfort and in-shoe plantar pressures at the heel and fifth metatarsal head region. Nine soccer academy players (age 15.7Â Â±Â 1.6Â years; height 1.80Â Â±Â 0.40Â m; body mass 71.9Â Â±Â 6.1Â kg) took part in the study. Two boot models (8 and 6 cleats) and two insoles (Poron and Poron/gel) provided four footwear combinations assessed using pressure insoles during running and 180Â° turning. Mechanical and comfort perception tests differentiated boot and insole conditions. During biomechanical testing, the Poron insole generally provided lower peak pressures than the Poron/gel insole, particularly during the braking step of the turn. The boot model did not independently influence peak pressures at the fifth metatarsal, and had minimal influence on heel loads. Specific boot-insole combinations performed differently (PÂ <Â 0.05). The 8-cleat boot and the Poron insole performed best biomechanically and perceptually, but the combined condition did not. Inclusion of kinematic data and improved control of the turning technique are recommended to strengthen future research. The mechanical, perception and biomechanical results highlight the need for a multi-faceted approach in the assessment of footwear.

A self-administered questionnaire was completed by 205 people with type 2 diabetes from the endocrine outpatient departments of three hospitals in Taiwan. Confirmatory factor analysis, criterion validity, and internal consistency reliability were conducted to evaluate the psychometric properties of the DCM-C. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed a four-factor structure (chi(2)/df ratio = 1.351, good of fit index (GFI) = .904, comparitive fit index (CFI) = .902, root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .041). The DCM-C was significantly associated with hemoglobin A1c and diabetes self-care behaviors. Internal consistency reliability of the total DCM-C scale was .74. Cronbach's alpha coefficients for each subscale of the DCM-C ranged from .37 (tackling spirit) to .66 (diabetes integration). The DCM-C demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity to determine the use of diabetes coping strategies. The tackling spirit dimension needs further refinement when applying this scale to Chinese populations with diabetes. Healthcare providers who treat Chinese people with diabetes can use the DCM-C to implement an early determination of diabetes coping strategies.

Comparison of the vascularity of fasciocutaneous tissue and muscle for coverage of open tibial fractures. Early coverage with vascularized soft-tissue flaps has dramatically improved the outcome in open tibial fractures. However, the ideal tissue for covering open fractures remains controversial. Several clinical studies suggest that muscle is superior to fasciocutaneous tissue; this is attributed to the presumed higher vascularity of muscle, although experimental evidence is inconclusive. The authors' previously described novel murine fracture model, which allows exclusive comparison of both tissues, demonstrated enhanced healing beneath muscle. The present study was undertaken to compare the vascularity of muscle and fasciocutaneous tissues over the course of fracture healing. Two experimental groups comprised mice with tibial fractures in contact with either muscle or fasciocutaneous tissues exclusively. Controls included a nontrauma group and those where soft tissues and periosteum were dissected but the tibia was not fractured. Animals were harvested between 3 and 28 days after fracture (n = 170 in total). The vascular density of the soft tissues was assessed using immunohistochemical techniques. Fasciocutaneous tissue was found to have a higher vascular density compared with muscle in contact with the fracture site at all time points (p < 0.0001, two-way analysis of variance), despite accelerated healing of fractures covered by muscle. The authors' data show that the more advanced healing of fractures covered by muscle compared with fasciocutaneous tissue is not related to the vascularity of the tissues, as the latter had a higher vascular density at all time points. Therefore, provided that a flap has sufficient vascularity to effectively reconstitute the soft-tissue envelope, other factors may be important in specifically promoting fracture healing.

Incidence, risk factors, management and outcomes of coronary artery perforation during percutaneous coronary intervention. Coronary artery perforation (CP) is a rare, sometimes lethal complication of percutaneous coronary intervention. There are limited controlled contemporary data regarding its predictors, incidence, and outcomes. The aim of this study was to define the incidence, associated factors, and outcomes of CP in the current era of coronary intervention. All patients who had CP during percutaneous coronary intervention at a large tertiary center from January 2001 to December 2008 were identified. Demographic, clinical, and procedural data and outcome variables were obtained. Patients with CP were compared with a randomly assigned control group. Fifty-seven patients with CP were identified among 9,568 interventions performed during the study period (0.59%); these patients were compared with 171 who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention without CP. Vessels were perforated by wires (52.6%), balloons (26.3%), and stents (21.1%). Perforations were classified using the Ellis classification. CP was associated with mortality and tamponade rates of 7% and 16%, respectively, but all these serious complications occurred with grade III perforations. Most grade I and II perforations were managed conservatively. Multivariate analysis identified the treatment of chronic total occlusion as the strongest independent predictor of CP; other independent variables included calcium in the coronary artery that was the site of intervention and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.

Safety and tolerability of artemether-lumefantrine versus dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine for malaria in young HIV-infected and uninfected children. Artemisinin combination therapy has become the standard of care for uncomplicated malaria in most of Africa. However, there is limited data on the safety and tolerability of these drugs, especially in young children and patients co-infected with HIV. A longitudinal, randomized controlled trial was conducted in a cohort of HIV-infected and uninfected children aged 4-22 months in Tororo, Uganda. Participants were randomized to treatment with artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) upon diagnosis of their first episode of uncomplicated malaria and received the same regimen for all subsequent episodes. Participants were actively monitored for adverse events for 28 days and then passively for up to 63 days after treatment. This study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (registration # NCT00527800). A total of 122 children were randomized to AL and 124 to DP, resulting in 412 and 425 treatments, respectively. Most adverse events were rare, with only cough, diarrhoea, vomiting, and anaemia occurring in more than 1% of treatments. There were no differences in the risk of these events between treatment groups. Younger age was associated with an increased risk of diarrhoea in both the AL and DP treatment arms. Retreatment for malaria within 17-28 days was associated with an increased risk of vomiting in the DP treatment arm (HR = 6.47, 95% CI 2.31-18.1, p < 0.001). There was no increase in the risk of diarrhoea or vomiting for children who were HIV-infected or on concomitant therapy with antiretrovirals or trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole prophylaxis. Both AL and DP were safe and well tolerated for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria in young HIV-infected and uninfected children.

Amylose-fatty acid inclusion complexes as examined by interfacial tension measurements. Amylose forms complexes with fatty acids under certain conditions, these complexes affect the functional properties of foods and could be potentially used as delivery systems of essential fatty acids in the human organism. This work uses dynamic and equilibrium interfacial tension measurements in order to investigate these complexes. First, the interfacial tension at the water/air interface under the conditions of complex formation (KOH 0.1N, pH=12.7) was measured for three fatty acids (capric, myristic and oleic) at different concentrations. Then, amylose-fatty acid complexes were formed at three different fatty acid to amylose ratios covering a range above and below the saturation concentration of the amylose helix. For all examined systems the dynamic interfacial tension of the mixed amylose-fatty acid solution was significantly higher than this of the fatty acid solution, showing that some of the fatty acid was no longer available to adsorb at the interface and suggesting its inclusion in the complex. Besides, the dynamic interfacial tension of the mixed system was lower compared to the pure amylose solution indicating that some of the fatty acid did not participate in the complexes even at fatty acid/amylose ratios well below the saturation concentration of amylose. Using the isotherm of the three fatty acids it was shown that the fatty acid excess depended on fatty acid-to-amylose ratio. 

A single-institution restrospective experience of brachytherapy in the treatment of pituitary tumors: transsphenoidal approach combined with (192)Ir-afterloading catheters. Radiotherapy may be used as an adjuvant treatment of pituitary adenomas. The aim of our study was to present our experience of multimodal treatment of pituitary adenomas, consisting in temporary implantation of (192)Ir-labeled wires following transphenoidal surgery. An observational investigation was performed on a series of 80 patients undergoing surgery (S) for pituitary adenomas between 1982 and 2000, some of whom received post-operative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (no.=19 between 1982 and 1990), brachytherapy (B) (no.=35, all after 1991), or both irradiation modalities (EBRT+B) (no.=14). The different treatments were compared in terms of hormonal normalization in the subgroup of patients with hypersecreting adenomas, tumor control, and side effects. Hormonal normalization was obtained in 84% of S+B patients and in 61% of S+EBRT patients. Tumor control was obtained in 74.3% of S+B patients and in 63.1% of S+EBRT patients. Anterior pituitary hormones deficits ranged from 8.6-34% in S+B patients and from 15.8-47.4% in S+EBRT patients, after a mean follow-up of 14 yr. The latter group also showed a higher rate of multiple deficits (42.1% vs 22.8%). Diabetes insipidus and other major complications were rare events in all groups. We presented one original experience regarding brachytherapy in the management of pituitary tumors, which turned out to be effective and safe. Additional prospective, and possibly randomized, studies should clarify whether in the era of 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy and stereotactic radiotherapy this treatment modality may still have a role.

Evaluation of the tongue drive system by individuals with high-level spinal cord injury. Tongue Drive System (TDS) is a tongue operated, unobtrusive, minimally invasive, wireless assistive technology (AT), which can enable people with severe disabilities to control different devices using their tongue motion. TDS can translate specific tongue movements into user-defined commands by detecting the position of a small permanent magnetic tracer attached to the users' tongue. We have built an external TDS (eTDS) prototype on a wireless headphone and interfaced it to a laptop and a commercial powered wheelchair (PWC). eTDS performance was evaluated by eight subjects with high level (C3 approximately C5) spinal cord injury (SCI) at the Shepherd Center in Atlanta, GA. Preliminary results show that all the subjects can successfully perform common tasks related to computer access, such as controlling a mouse cursor or playing a computer game, as well as complex wheelchair navigation tasks, such as driving through an obstacle course.

Modafinil effects on cognitive function in HIV+ patients treated for fatigue: a placebo controlled study. Both mild cognitive impairment and fatigue are common among people with HIV/AIDS. This study examined the efficacy of modafinil for HIV+ patients who sought treatment for fatigue in a placebo-controlled double-blind 4-week trial. A battery of standard neuropsychological tests was administered at study entry and Week 4, and change in performance was compared for 59 patients receiving modafinil versus 44 patients receiving placebo. A significant effect on fatigue was observed. In addition, cognitive performance, as measured by a global change score, improved more in the modafinil than in the placebo group although the effect was not specific to any cognitive domain.

Association of susceptibility to multiple sclerosis in Southern Han Chinese with HLA-DRB1, -DPB1 alleles and DRB1-DPB1 haplotypes: distinct from other populations. Association of HLA class II with multiple sclerosis (MS) has been widely studied in both Western and Oriental populations. However, such an association is not well documented in Chinese. The objective of this study was to examine the association between the susceptibility to conventional MS in Southern Chinese with HLA-DRB1,-DPB1 alleles and putative DRB1-DPB1 haplotypes. Genotyping of HLA-DRB1 and -DPB1 alleles was performed in 60 patients with conventional MS and 95 controls. Allele frequencies were compared between patients and controls to identify MS-associated alleles. Relative predisposing effect method was used to compare haplotype frequencies in patients and controls and to identify possible predisposing DRB1-DPB1 haplotypes, which were further examined for differences in haplotype carriage rates between the two groups. We found that the allele frequency of DRB1*1501 was not different between patients (18.3%) and controls (21.1%) (p = 0.837). In contrast, frequency of the DPB1*0501 allele was significantly higher in patients (90%) than in controls (67.4%) (odds ratio = 4.36, p = 0.0013, pcorr = 0.025). DRB1-DPB1 linkage haplotype in patients (8.33%) was significantly higher than in controls (0%) (p < 0.0001) and the carriage rate of this haplotype was significantly increased in patients (15%) as compared with controls (0%) (p = 0.00013, pcorr = 0.003). Combined, these results suggest that HLA-DRB1*1501 is not associated with susceptibility to conventional MS in Southern Chinese. Instead, both the DPB1*0501 allele and the DRB1*1602- DPB1*0501 haplotype are strong predisposing factors for conventional MS in this population. Our results establish that the HLA profiles of MS in Southern Chinese are distinct from other populations.

Cardiovascular effects of uremia in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. The purpose of this thesis work was to establish an experimental mouse model for studying the pathogenesis and therapy of accelerated atherosclerosis in uremia. Uremia was induced by surgical 5/6 nephrectomy in apolipoprotein E-deficient (apoE-/-) mice and led to development of severe aortic atherosclerosis independently of BP and plasma homocysteine levels. Also, the accelerated atherosclerosis could not be fully explained by changes in total plasma cholesterol. Morphologic and biochemical analyses of aortas suggested that accelerated initiation and expansion rather than a specific uremic lesion composition characterize atherosclerosis in the uremic mice. Increased expression of inflammatory genes in aortas of uremic mice suggests that an augmented inflammatory response in the arterial wall might be an important impetus for accelerated atherosclerosis in uremia. A marked downregulation of expression of smooth muscle cell assigned genes indicates that besides intimal atherosclerosis, uremic vasculopathy in apoE-/- mice is characterized by a uremia-specific medial smooth muscle cell degeneration. Oxidative stress could also be important for the development of atherosclerotic lesions in uremia. In the mouse model, uremia led to a marked increase of titers of antibodies against oxidized LDL (OxLDL), and increased circulating levels of the oxidized phospholipid epitope EO6. Treatment with enalapril (an ACE inhibitor) almost completely prevented the development of accelerated aortic atherosclerosis in uremic mice. This effect was parallelled by reductions of aortic expression of the proinflammatory adhesion molecule VCAM-1, and plasma titers of IgM antibodies against OxLDL, and was at least partly independent of BP-lowering. To test the involvement of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in development of uremic atherosclerosis, uremic mice were treated with a neutralizing RAGE-antibody. This treatment reduced the aortic plaque area fraction by 59% in parallel with reductions of the plasma levels of the oxidized phospholipid epitope EO6, and titers of IgG antibodies against OxLDL. As opposed to rats and CD-1 mice, apoE-/- mice did not have impaired cardiac structure and function (as assessed by echocardiography, histology, gene expression analysis) upon the induction of uremia. Since the uremic apoE -/- mouse is normotensive and did not develop myocardial calcifications, it is possible that these factors may be important for the development of cardiac dysfunction in uremia. In conclusion, the mice studies by Bro et al. showed that uremic vasculopathy in apoE-/- mice, besides accelerated intimal atherosclerosis, was characterized by a uremia-specific medial smooth muscle cell degeneration. Furthermore, the studies suggested that vascular inflammation and systemic oxidative stress may explain some of the proatherogenic effects of uremia in mice. Interestingly, the accelerated atherosclerosis could be prevented by RAS inhibition, or markedly reduced by RAGE blockade, probably through anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects. The new uremic mouse model has provided a tool to identify molecular responses of the arterial wall to uremia, and may help identify new approaches for treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic disease in uremia. Also, the data obtained with the mouse model provide a platform for further studies in humans.


Quorum Sensing Protects Pseudomonas aeruginosa against Cheating by Other Species in a Laboratory Coculture Model.

In vivo diffusion tensor imaging of chronic spinal cord compression in rat model. Chronic spinal cord compression induced cervical myelopathy is a comon cause of spinal cord dysfunction. The exact mechanisms of underlying progressive cell death remain to be elucidated. In this study, in vivo diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has been applied to investigate the microstructural changes of white matter (WM) in this neurodegenerative disease. Compared with conventional MRI techniques, DTI is believed to be more specific to pathological changes. Radial diffusivity (lambda upper left and right quadrants) is higher in the ipilesional region, suggesting demyelination or axonal degradation may occur after prolonged compression. Near the epicenter of lesion, axial diffusivity (lambda(//)) is lower. Also, caudal-rostral asymmetry has been observed in lambda(//). Feasibility of using DTI to detect microstructural changes in chronic disease has been demonstrated.

Inferior mesenteric artery stenting: a solution for chronic mesenteric ischemia. Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is a rare entity with potentially tragic consequences. Meanwhile, there is still no consensus regarding the most adequate treatment approach. The authors herein report a case of a 65-year-old woman with severe CMI as a result of an occlusion of both the celiac artery (CA) and superior mesenteric artery (SMA) and a significant stenosis of the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) ostium. The patient was successfully treated by angioplasty and stenting of the IMA. Even though the usual approach for CMI is revascularization of the CA and the SMA, the present case demonstrates that IMA can have a central role in visceral circulation, and its endovascular revascularization can be the first treatment option in selected cases.

Laboratory scale bioremediation of diesel hydrocarbon in soil by indigenous bacterial consortium. In vitro experiment was performed by taking petrol pump soils and diesel in flasks with the micronutrients and macronutrients supplements. Cemented bioreactors having sterilized soil and diesel was used for in vivo analysis of diesel hydrocarbon degradation. There were two sets of experiments, first having three bioreactors (1) inoculated by KI. pneumoniae subsp. aerogenes with soil and diesel; (2) with addition of NH4NO3; and (3) served as control. In second set, one bioreactor was inoculated by bacterial consortium containing Moraxella saccharolytica, Alteromonas putrefaciens, KI. pneumoniae subsp. aerogenes and Pseudomonas fragi along with soil and diesel. The remaining two bioreactors (having NH4NO3 and control) were similar to the first set. The experiments were incubated for 30 days. Ability of bacterial inoculum to degrade diesel was analyzed through GC-MS. Smaller chain compounds were obtained after experimental period of 30 days. Rate of diesel degradation was better with the present bacterial consortium than individual bacteria. Present bacterial consortium can be a better choice for faster and complete remediation of contaminated hydrocarbon soils.

Strategies to reduce sodium consumption: a food industry perspective. The global high prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular disease has raised concerns regarding the sodium content of the foods which we consume. Over 75% of sodium intake in industrialized diets is likely to come from processed and restaurant foods. Therefore international authorities, such as the World Health Organisation, are encouraging the food industry to reduce sodium levels in their products. Significant sodium reduction is not without complications as salt plays an important role in taste, and in some products is needed also for preservation and processing. The most promising sodium reduction strategy is to adapt the preference of consumers for saltiness by reducing sodium in products in small steps. However, this is a time-consuming approach that needs to be applied industry-wide in order to be effective. Therefore the food industry is also investigating solutions that will maintain the same perceived salt intensity at lower sodium levels. Each of these has specific advantages, disadvantages, and time lines for implementation. Currently applied approaches are resulting in sodium reduction between 20-30%. Further reduction will require new technologies. Research into the physiology of taste perception and salt receptors is an emerging area of science that is needed in order to achieve larger sodium reductions.

In this section, we review 3 important and potentially enabling technologies: (1) robotics, (2) anastomotic connectors, and (3) the expanding role of imaging in the context of combined operating room/catheterization laboratories (hybrid suites).

Treatment With Lopinavir/Ritonavir or Interferon-Î²1b Improves Outcome of MERS-CoV Infection in a Nonhuman Primate Model of Common Marmoset. Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) causes severe disease in human with an overall case-fatality rate of >35%. Effective antivirals are crucial for improving the clinical outcome of MERS. Although a number of repurposed drugs, convalescent-phase plasma, antiviral peptides, and neutralizing antibodies exhibit anti-MERS-CoV activity in vitro, most are not readily available or have not been evaluated in nonhuman primates. We assessed 3 repurposed drugs with potent in vitro anti-MERS-CoV activity (mycophenolate mofetil [MMF], lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon-Î²1b) in common marmosets with severe disease resembling MERS in humans. The lopinavir/ritonavir-treated and interferon-Î²1b-treated animals had better outcome than the untreated animals, with improved clinical (mean clinical scores â50.9%-95.0% and âweight loss than the untreated animals), radiological (minimal pulmonary infiltrates), and pathological (mild bronchointerstitial pneumonia) findings, and lower mean viral loads in necropsied lung (â0.59-1.06 log10 copies/glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GAPDH]; P < .050) and extrapulmonary (â0.11-1.29 log10 copies/GAPDH; P < .050 in kidney) tissues. In contrast, all MMF-treated animals developed severe and/or fatal disease with higher mean viral loads (â0.15-0.54 log10 copies/GAPDH) than the untreated animals. The mortality rate at 36 hours postinoculation was 67% (untreated and MMF-treated) versus 0-33% (lopinavir/ritonavir-treated and interferon-Î²1b-treated). Lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon-Î²1b alone or in combination should be evaluated in clinical trials. MMF alone may worsen MERS and should not be used. 


Role of diffusion tensor imaging in resection of thalamic juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma.

Current trends in quantitative proteomics. It was inevitable that as soon as mass spectrometrists were able to tell biologists which proteins were in their samples, the next question would be how much of these proteins were present. This has turned out to be a much more challenging question. In this review, we describe the multiple ways that mass spectrometry has attempted to address this issue, both for relative quantitation and for absolute quantitation of proteins. There is no single method that will work for every problem or for every sample. What we present here is a variety of techniques, with guidelines that we hope will assist the researcher in selecting the most appropriate technique for the particular biological problem that needs to be addressed. We need to emphasize that this is a very active area of proteomics research-new quantitative methods are continuously being introduced and some 'pitfalls' of older methods are just being discovered. However, even though there is no perfect technique--and a better technique may be developed tomorrow--valuable information on biomarkers and pathways can be obtained using these currently available methods.

Identification of critical molecules via fault diagnosis engineering. Systems biology envisions that the application of complex system engineering approaches to cell signaling molecular networks can lead to novel understandings of complex human disorders. In this paper we show that by developing biologically-driven vulnerability assessment methods, the vulnerability of complex signaling networks to the dysfunction of each molecule can be determined. We have analyzed signaling networks that regulate mitosis and the activity of the transcription factor CREB. Our results indicate that biologically-relevant critical components of intracellular molecular networks can be identified using the proposed systems biology/fault diagnosis engineering technique. The application of this approach can improve our physiological understanding of the functionality of biological systems, can be used as a tool to identify novel genes associated with complex human disorders, and ultimately, has the potential to find the most prominent targets for drug discovery.

Runx2 regulates survivin expression in prostate cancer cells. Previously we described that bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP7) could protect prostate cancer C4-2B cells from serum starvation-induced apoptosis via survivin induction. Here, for the first time, we identify Runx2 as a key regulator of survivin transcription. In C4-2B cells grown normally, suppression of Runx2 reduced survivin expression. Using ChIP assays, two regions of the survivin promoter, -1953 to -1812 (I) and -1485 to -1119 (II) encompassing consensus Runx-binding sites were examined. Runx2 was found to be associated with both regions, with a stronger affinity to region-I. In serum-starved cells neither region was occupied, but BMP7 restored association to region-II and not region-I. In reporter assays, transcription activity by BMP7 was significantly reduced when sequences including binding sites of region-II were deleted. Additionally, Runx2 expression was enhanced by BMP7 in these cells. Along with a strong survivin expression, a trend in increased Runx2 expression in human prostate cancer cells and tissues was noted. In the conditional Pten-knockout mouse, Runx2 level increased with growth of prostate tumor. The data define a novel role of Runx2 in regulating survivin expression in malignant epithelial cells and identify it as a critical factor in BMP signaling that protects cancer cells against apoptosis.

[Mutation analysis of the androgen receptor gene in a complete androgen insensitivity syndrome family]. To study the mutation of the androgen receptor gene in a family with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome and to explore the pathogenicity of the mutation. PCR and DNA sequencing were performed to study the AR gene mutation; Mbo I restriction endonuclease was used to detect existence of the mutation in normal controls; conservation of the mutation site was analyzed by comparison of the sequence of amino acid among different species. The DNA sequence of the three patients contained the same substitution of a single nucleotide on codon 681 GAG to GAT of exon 4, which located in the ligand binding domain of the AR receptor and led to substitution of glutamic acid to aspartic acid in the AR receptor. Their mother was heterozygote of E681D. E681D was not observed in the normal controls. The E681 site was extremely conservative in different species. The E681D mutation of the AR gene is a novel mutation of leading to complete androgen insensitivity syndrome.

Investigation of the differences between the "Cold" and "Hot" nature of Coptis chinensis Franch and its processed materials based on animal's temperature tropism. The description and differentiation of the so-called "Cold" and "Hot" natures, the primary "Drug Naure" of Chinese medicine, is the focus of theoretical research. In this study, the divergency between the "Cold" and the "Hot" natures was investigated through examining the temperature tropism of mice affected by Coptis chinensis Franch and its processed materials by using a cold/hot plate differentiating technology. After exposure to C. chinensis Franch, the macroscopic behavioral index of the remaining rate (RR) on a warm pad (40 degrees C) significantly increased (P<0.05), suggesting the enhancement of Hot tropism. The internal indexes of adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity and oxygen consuming volume decreased significantly (P<0.05), suggesting the decapability of energy metabolism. This external behavior of Hot tropism might reflect the internal Cold nature of C. chinensis Franch. However, the processed materials of C. chinensis Franch exhibited a different Cold nature in temperature tropism compared with crude C. chinensis Franch (CC): the Cold nature of bile-processed C. chinensis Franch (BC) enhanced while the ginger-processed C. chinensis Franch (GC) changed inversely. The changing sequence was consistent with the theoretical prognostication. It is indicated that the external Cold & Hot natures of Chinese medicine may possibly reflect in an ethological way for the changes of animal's temperature tropism which might be internally regulated by the body's energy metabolism.

Robotic high para-aortic lymph node dissection with high port placement using same port for pelvic surgery in gynecologic cancer patients. This study reports our initial experience of robotic high para-aortic lymph node dissection (PALND) with high port placement using same port for pelvic surgery in cervical and endometrial cancer patients. Between July 2013 and January 2014, we performed robotic high PALND up to the left renal vein during staging surgeries. With high port placement and same port usage for pelvic surgery, high PALND was successfully performed without repositioning the robotic column. All data were registered consecutively and analyzed retrospectively. All patients successfully underwent robotic high PALND, followed by hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. Median age was 45 years (range, 39 to 51 years) and median body mass index was 22 kg/mÂ² (range, 19.3 to 23.1 kg/mÂ²). Median operative time for right PALND and left PALND was 37 minutes (range, 22 to 65 minutes) and 44 minutes (range, 36 to 50 minutes), respectively. Median number of right and left para-aortic lymph node by pathologic report was 12 (range, 8 to 15) and 13 (range, 5 to 26). With high port placement and one assistant port, robotic high PALND with the same port used in pelvic surgery is feasible to non-obese patients.


Fetuin-A/albumin-mineral complexes resembling serum calcium granules and putative nanobacteria: demonstration of a dual inhibition-seeding concept.

Carotenoid-based plumage colouration is associated with blood parasite richness and stress protein levels in blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus). Carotenoids are molecules that birds are not able to synthesize and therefore, must be acquired through their diet. These pigments, besides their function of giving birds red and yellow colouration when deposited in feathers, seem to act as immune-stimulators and antioxidants in the organism. Hence, only the healthiest individuals would be able to express carotenoid-based ornaments to a larger extent without compromising the physiological functions of carotenoids. Various studies have reported that birds infected by parasites are paler than those uninfected, but, to our knowledge, none of them has assessed the possible effect of multiple infections by blood parasites on plumage colour. By comparing the yellow colour in the breast plumage of blue tits, Cyanistes caeruleus, between birds infected by different numbers of blood parasite genera, we found that those birds infected by more than one genus were paler than those parasitized just by one. In addition, we examined the potential role of carotenoid-based plumage colour of blue tits as a long-term indicator of other parameters of health status, such as body condition and immunoglobulin and heat shock protein (HSP) levels. Our results indicate that more brightly coloured birds had lower HSP70 levels than paler birds, but we did not find any significant association between colour and body condition or immunoglobulin levels. In addition, we found a positive significant association between Haemoproteus density of infection and HSP60 levels. Overall, these results support the role of carotenoid-based colours as indicators of health status in blue tits and show detrimental effects of parasitism on this character.


A pilot study of naturally occurring high-probability request sequences in hostage negotiations.

Plasma membrane subdomain compartmentalization contributes to distinct mechanisms of ceramide action on insulin signaling. Ceramide is now recognized as a negative regulator of insulin signaling by impairing protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt activation. In different cells, two distinct mechanisms have been proposed to mediate ceramide inhibition of PKB/Akt: one involving atypical protein kinase C zeta (PKCzeta) and the other the protein phosphatase-2 (PP2A). We hypothesized that ceramide action through PKCzeta or PP2A might depend on plasma membrane (PM) structural organization and especially on caveolin-enriched domain (CEM) abundance. We have used different PKCzeta mutant constructs or the PP2A inhibitor, okadaic acid (OKA), to selectively inhibit PKCzeta- and PP2A-dependent pathways in cells expressing different caveolin-1 levels and evaluated the impact of insulin and ceramide on PKB/Akt activity in different PM subdomains. Although the PKCzeta-mediated negative effect of ceramide on insulin-stimulated PKB/Akt was dominant in adipocytes, a ceramide action through PP2A outside CEMs, prevented by OKA, was also unraveled. To test the importance of CEM to direct ceramide action through the PKCzeta pathway, we treated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes devoid of CEMs with ceramide and we saw a shift of the lipid-negative action on PKB/Akt to a PP2A-mediated mechanism. In fibroblasts with low CEM abundance, the ceramide-activated PP2A pathway dominated, but could be shifted to a ceramide-activated PKCzeta pathway after caveolin-1 overexpression. Our results show that ceramide can switch from a PKCzeta-dependent mechanism to a PP2A pathway, acting negatively on PKB/Akt, and hence revealing a critical role of CEMs of the PM in this process.

Imaging in sinonasal sarcoidosis: CT, MRI, 67Gallium scintigraphy and 18F-FDG PET/CT features. Attempt to describe and analyse the radiological and nuclear medicine patterns of sinonasal sarcoidosis (SNS) still poorly reported in the literature. Retrospective single institution study of 22 consecutive patients with symptomatic biopsy-proven SNS to evaluate the interest of CT, MRI, (67)Ga scintigraphy and (18)F-FDG PET/CT for diagnosis and therapeutic follow-up. Nodules of the septum and turbinates are the most suggestive CT and MRI features. Other CT features such as sinusal filling, mucosal thickening, osteosclerosis or destructive sinonasal lesions are not specific and depend on clinical context and evolutive stage of SNS. (18)F-FDG PET/CT provides complete morphofunctional mapping of active inflammatory sites related to sarcoidosis with a better diagnostic sensitivity (100%) compared to (67)Gallium scintigraphy (75%). The changes in (18)F-FDG uptake intensity could reflect the efficacy of treatment. SNS is an uncommon and probably underdiagnosed phenotype of sarcoidosis. Even if guided biopsy remains necessary for SNS confirmation, medical imaging plays an important role in diagnosis and therapeutic follow-up. CT features with nodules of the septum and/or turbinates are suggestive of SNS contrary to other nonspecific CT findings. CT imaging is directly related severity, reversibility and course of SNS and provide an original radiological staging system in order to predict patient clinical outcome. PET/CT may be used for diagnosis assessement but also to monitor treatment response in a given clinical context, in a patient with histopathologically-proven SNS. Prospective and long term studies are necessary to validate these preliminary results.

Acidic environment augments FcÎµRI-mediated production of IL-6 and IL-13 in mast cells. Although blood pH is maintained in a narrow range of around pH 7.4 in living organisms, inflammatory loci are characterized by acidic conditions. Mast cells tend to reside close to the surface of the body in areas such as the mucosa and skin where they may be exposed to exogenous acids, and they play an important role in immune responses. However, little is known about the effects of extracellular acidification on the functions of mast cell. Here, we found that extracellular acidification increased the dinitrophenyl-conjugated human serum albumin (DNP-HSA)-induced production of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-13 in MC/9 cells or bone marrow-derived mouse mast cells sensitized with anti-DNP IgE. Extracellular acidification also inhibited migration of MC/9 cells toward DNP-HSA. In addition, acidic pH stimulated antigen-induced activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase B (Akt). These findings suggest that extracellular acidification augmented antigen/IgE-induced and FcÎµRI-mediated production of IL-6 and IL-13 in mast cells, and that this was associated with the enhancement of p38 MAPK and Akt activation. 

Experimental validation of a pinless femoral reference array for computer-assisted hip arthroplasty. The use of computer navigation systems during total hip arthroplasty requires the femoral fixation of a reflective dynamic reference base (DRB), which theoretically involves the risk of bony fracture, infection, and pin loosening. The first objective of this study was to evaluate the relative movements between a novel, noninvasive external femoral DRB system and the femur. Secondly, the maximum effects of these 3D movements on intraoperative, computer-assisted leg length and offset measures were evaluated. An imageless navigation system was used to track the positions of the soft tissue attached, pinless DRB relative to an invasive reference marker on the femur during a less-invasive, anterior surgical hip approach. Relative translatory movements up to 8.2 mm mediolaterally and up to 8.8 degrees in rotation were measured. Using a measurement technique in which the calculation of leg length and offset changes is primarily based on a specific realignment of the leg, maximum differences of 1.3 mm for leg length and 1.2 mm for offset were found when comparing the pin-based and pinless methods. Thus, invasive fixation techniques with screws or pins are still the method of choice when standard measurement algorithms for intraoperative leg length and offset measures are used. Though direct translatory and rotational variations between the pinless array and the femoral bone were detected, the pinless array can be used to assess leg length and offset when used with a specific measurement technique that compensates for such variations.

Treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor is associated with reduced indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase activity and kynurenine pathway catabolites in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. The immunoregulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) controls tryptophan metabolism and is induced by pro-inflammatory stimuli. We investigated whether immunostimulatory treatment with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) influences IDO activity and tryptophan metabolism in sepsis. Thirty-six patients with severe sepsis/septic shock and sepsis-associated immunosuppression (assessed using monocytic human leukocyte antigen-DR (mHLA-DR) expression) were assessed in a controlled trial of GM-CSF or placebo treatment for 8 days. Using tandem mass spectrometry, levels of tryptophan, kynurenine, kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid, 5-hydroxytryptophan, serotonin, and estimated IDO activity were determined in a blinded fashion over a 9-day interval. At baseline, tryptophan and metabolite levels did not differ between the study groups. Although tryptophan levels were unchanged in both groups over the treatment interval (all p>0.8), IDO activity was markedly reduced after GM-CSF treatment (35.4 +/- 21.0 vs 21.6 +/-9.9 (baseline vs day 9), p = 0.02). IDO activity differed significantly between the 2 groups after therapy (p = 0.03). Metabolites downstream of IDO (kynurenine, quinolinic acid, kynurenic acid) were all induced in sepsis and declined in the GM-CSF group, but not in controls. Serotonin pathway metabolites remained unchanged in both groups (all p>0.15). Moreover, IDO activity correlated with procalcitonin (p< 0.0001, r = 0.56) and mHLA-DR levels (p = 0.005, r = -0.28) in the overall samples group. Thus, GM-CSF therapy is associated with decreased IDO activity and reduced kynurenine pathway catabolites in sepsis. This may be due to an improved antibacterial defence.


Exogenous cortisol acutely influences motivated decision making in healthy young men.

Prospective randomized comparison of durability of bidirectional conduction block in the cavotricuspid isthmus in patients after ablation of common atrial flutter using cryothermy and radiofrequency energy: the CRYOTIP study. Recent studies have shown that cryoablation and radiofrequency (RF) ablation are comparable with regard to success rates and safety in the treatment of common atrial flutter (AFL). Long-term success requires persistence of bidirectional conduction block (BCB) in the inferior cavotricuspid isthmus (CTI). The purpose of this study was to determine the persistence of BCB in a prospective randomized multicenter trial of the two ablation techniques. A total of 191 patients were randomized to RF ablation or cryoablation of the CTI using an 8-mm-tip catheter. In all patients, BCB was defined as the ablation end-point. Primary end-point of the study was nonpersistence of achieved BCB and/or ECG-documented relapse of common AFL within 3-month follow-up. Acute success rates were 91% (83/91) in the RF group and 89% (80/90) in the cryoablation group (P = NS). Invasive follow-up after 3 months with repeated electrophysiologic study was available for 60 patients in the RF group and 64 patients in the cryoablation group. Persistent BCB could be confirmed in 85% of the RF group versus 65.6% of the cryoablation group. The primary end-point was achieved in 15% of the RF group and 34.4% of the cryoablation group (P = .014). As a secondary end-point, pain perception during ablation was significant lower in the cryoablation group (P <.001). Persistence of BCB in patients treated with cryoablation reinvestigated after 3 months is inferior to that patients treated with RF ablation, as evidenced by the higher recurrence rate of common AFL seen in this study.

Cardiovascular fitness is associated with cognition in young adulthood. During early adulthood, a phase in which the central nervous system displays considerable plasticity and in which important cognitive traits are shaped, the effects of exercise on cognition remain poorly understood. We performed a cohort study of all Swedish men born in 1950 through 1976 who were enlisted for military service at age 18 (N = 1,221,727). Of these, 268,496 were full-sibling pairs, 3,147 twin pairs, and 1,432 monozygotic twin pairs. Physical fitness and intelligence performance data were collected during conscription examinations and linked with other national databases for information on school achievement, socioeconomic status, and sibship. Relationships between cardiovascular fitness and intelligence at age 18 were evaluated by linear models in the total cohort and in subgroups of full-sibling pairs and twin pairs. Cardiovascular fitness, as measured by ergometer cycling, positively associated with intelligence after adjusting for relevant confounders (regression coefficient b = 0.172; 95% CI, 0.168-0.176). Similar results were obtained within monozygotic twin pairs. In contrast, muscle strength was not associated with cognitive performance. Cross-twin cross-trait analyses showed that the associations were primarily explained by individual specific, non-shared environmental influences (> or = 80%), whereas heritability explained < 15% of covariation. Cardiovascular fitness changes between age 15 and 18 y predicted cognitive performance at 18 y. Cox proportional-hazards models showed that cardiovascular fitness at age 18 y predicted educational achievements later in life. These data substantiate that physical exercise could be an important instrument for public health initiatives to optimize educational achievements, cognitive performance, as well as disease prevention at the society level.

A retrospective cohort study of the association of anesthesia and hernia repair surgery with behavioral and developmental disorders in young children. Recent animal studies have shown that commonly used anesthetic agents may have serious neurotoxic effects on the developing brain. The purpose of this study was to assess the association between surgery for hernia repair and the risk of behavioral and developmental disorders in young children. We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of children who were enrollees of the New York State Medicaid program. Our analysis involved following a birth cohort of 383 children who underwent inguinal hernia repair during the first 3 years of life, and a sample of 5050 children frequency-matched on age with no history of hernia-repair before age 3. After controlling for age, sex, and complicating birth-related conditions such as low birth weight, children who underwent hernia repair under 3 years of age were more than twice as likely as children in the comparison group to be subsequently diagnosed with a developmental or behavioral disorder (adjusted hazard ratio 2.3, 95% confidence interval 1.3, 4.1). Our findings add to recent evidence of the potential association of surgery and its concurrent exposure to anesthetic agents with neurotoxicity and underscore the need for more rigorous clinical research on the long-term effects of surgery and anesthesia in children.

Knockout of Ku86 accelerates cellular senescence induced by high NaCl. NaCl induces DNA breaks, thus leading to cellular senescence. Here we showed that Ku86 deficiency accelerated the high NaCl-induced cellular senescence. We find that 1) high NaCl induces rapid cellular senescence in Ku86 deficient(xrs5) cells, 2) Ku86 deficiency shortens lifespan of C. elegans in high NaCl, and 3) cellular senescence is greatly accelerated in renal inner medullas of Ku86 (-/-) mice. Further, although water balance is known to be compromised in old mice, this occurs at much earlier age in Ku86(-/-) mice. When subjected to mild water restriction, 3 month old Ku86(-/-), but not Ku86(+/+),mice rapidly become dehydrated as evidenced by decrease in body weight, increased production of antidiuretic hormone,increased urine osmolality and decreased urine volume. The deficiency in water balance does not occur in Ku86(+/+)mice until they are much older (14 months). We conclude that Ku86 deficiency accelerates high NaCl(-) induced cellular senescence,particularly in the renal medulla where NaCl normally is high.

PET-based compartmental modeling of (124)I-A33 antibody: quantitative characterization of patient-specific tumor targeting in colorectal cancer. The molecular specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against tumor antigens has proven effective for targeted therapy of human cancers, as shown by a growing list of successful antibody-based drug products. We describe a novel, nonlinear compartmental model using PET-derived data to determine the "best-fit" parameters and model-derived quantities for optimizing biodistribution of intravenously injected (124)I-labeled antitumor antibodies. As an example of this paradigm, quantitative image and kinetic analyses of anti-A33 humanized mAb (also known as "A33") were performed in 11 colorectal cancer patients. Serial whole-body PET scans of (124)I-labeled A33 and blood samples were acquired and the resulting tissue time-activity data for each patient were fit to a nonlinear compartmental model using the SAAM II computer code. Excellent agreement was observed between fitted and measured parameters of tumor uptake, "off-target" uptake in bowel mucosa, blood clearance, tumor antigen levels, and percent antigen occupancy. This approach should be generally applicable to antibody-antigen systems in human tumors for which the masses of antigen-expressing tumor and of normal tissues can be estimated and for which antibody kinetics can be measured with PET. Ultimately, based on each patient's resulting "best-fit" nonlinear model, a patient-specific optimum mAb dose (in micromoles, for example) may be derived.

Voluntary Exercise Training: Analysis of Mice in Uninjured, Inflammatory, and Nerve-Injured Pain States. Both clinical and animal studies suggest that exercise may be an effective way to manage inflammatory and neuropathic pain conditions. However, existing animal studies commonly use forced exercise paradigms that incorporate varying degrees of stress, which itself can elicit analgesia, and thus may complicate the interpretation of the effects of exercise on pain. We investigated the analgesic potential of voluntary wheel running in the formalin model of acute inflammatory pain and the spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain in mice. In uninjured, adult C57BL/6J mice, 1 to 4 weeks of exercise training did not alter nociceptive thresholds, lumbar dorsal root ganglia neuronal excitability, or hindpaw intraepidermal innervation. Further, exercise training failed to attenuate formalin-induced spontaneous pain. Lastly, 2 weeks of exercise training was ineffective in reversing spared nerve injury-induced mechanical hypersensitivity or in improving muscle wasting or hindpaw denervation. These findings indicate that in contrast to rodent forced exercise paradigms, short durations of voluntary wheel running do not improve pain-like symptoms in mouse models of acute inflammation and peripheral nerve injury.

Persistent Human Chorionic Gonadotropin After Methotrexate Treatment and an Emergency Surgical Procedure for Ectopic Pregnancy.

Stu1 inversely regulates kinetochore capture and spindle stability. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae CLASP (CLIP-associated protein) Stu1 is essential for the establishment and maintenance of the mitotic spindle. Furthermore, Stu1 localizes to kinetochores. Here we show that, in prometaphase, Stu1 assembles in an Ndc80-dependent manner exclusively at kinetochores that are not attached to microtubules. Stu1 relocates to microtubules when a captured kinetochore reaches a spindle pole. This relocation does not depend on kinetochore biorientation, but requires a functional DASH complex. Stu1 at detached kinetochores facilitates kinetochore capturing. Furthermore, since most of the nuclear Stu1 is sequestered by one or a few detached kinetochores, the presence of detached kinetochores prevents Stu1 from localizing the spindle, and therefore from stabilizing the spindle. Thus, the sequestering of Stu1 by detached kinetochores serves as a checkpoint that keeps spindle poles in close proximity until all kinetochores are captured. This is likely to facilitate kinetochore biorientation. In agreement with the findings described above, a kinetochore mutant (okp1-52) that fails to release Stu1 from the kinetochore displays a severe spindle defect upon spindle pole body separation, and this defect can be rescued by destroying the okp1-52 kinetochore.

[Surgical treatment of 133 cases of multi-drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis]. To evaluate the clinical significance of pulmonary resection for multi-drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. The clinical data were retrospectively reviewed for patients with multi-drug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis for which surgical resection of the lung was undertaken. From January 1980 to December 2007, 1188 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, including 133 multi-drug resistant cases, underwent pulmonary resection in Beijing Chest Hospital. Surgical procedures included pneumonectomy in 45, pulmonary lobectomy in 73 (including sleeve resection of the bronchus in 5), pleuropneumonectomy in 13, segment resection in 1, and wedge resection in 1 cases. Preoperative and postoperative antituberculosis chemotherapy was given for no less than 6 months and 6 to 18 months, respectively. Two cases died of perioperative respiratory failure, and 1 died of internal bleeding, the mortality rate being 2.3% (3/133). The incidence of postoperative complications was 17.3% (23/133), including 9 cases with stump fistula of bronchus. Follow-up lasted for 6 months to 15 years (average 52 months), and medical treatment lasted for 6 - 18 months. After follow-up, the sputum negative conversion rate was 90.2% (101/112). Pulmonary resection is an effective approach to multi-drug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis with long-term sputum positivity of limited local lesions, or negative sputum of local lesions but failure to antituberculosis chemotherapy for at least 3 months.

Oral magnesium supplementation in adults with coronary heart disease or coronary heart disease risk. To review randomized control clinical trial (RCT) literature and prospective studies for the safety and efficacy of magnesium supplements in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or with CHD risk. Databases were searched using the keywords: magnesium, heart disease, endothelium, prevention, treatment, therapy, level, and supplement. There were no reports of adverse effects from magnesium supplementation in any of the studies. Subjects reporting lower dietary magnesium intake had significantly lower serum magnesium concentrations than those reporting higher dietary magnesium intake and, in some cases, had a significantly higher frequency of supraventricular beats. There was a modest relationship between dietary magnesium intake and a reduced risk of CHD in male subjects; however, there was no noted decrease in the development of CHD disease in women who had high magnesium intake. Magnesium is vital for many functions in the body and magnesium supplementation is safe. There is a possible association between a modestly lower risk of CHD in men and increased magnesium intake; therefore, it is reasonable to encourage diets high in magnesium as a potential means to lower the risk of CHD.


Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty and stenting for pulmonary stenosis due to Takayasu's arteritis: clinical outcome and four-year follow-up.

Phlebotomine sand flies (Diptera: Psychodidae: Phlebotominae) of Alagoas state, northeast of Brazil. The phlebotomine sandflies of the state of Alagoas are poorly known, with more than 40 years since the last report on sandflies in the state. In here, Psathyromyia brasiliensis (Costa Lima), Micropygomyia quinquefer (Dyar,) and Evandromyia termitophila (Martins, FalcÃ£o & Silva) are registered for the first time in Alagoas. This report increases to nine the number of species collected in the state, including Lutzomyia longipalpis (Lutz & Neiva), Migonemyia migonei (FranÃ§a), Nyssomyia whitmani (Antunes & Coutinho) and Nyssomyia intermedia (Lutz & Neiva), all vectors of Leishmania in Brazil.

Right ventricular remodelling in pulmonary arterial hypertension with three-dimensional echocardiography: comparison with cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Right ventricular (RV) mass and volume calculations are important correlates of survival in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). We tested the hypothesis that RV mass, volumes and function could be measured accurately with real-time three-dimensional echocardiography (3DE) in patients with PAH and compared those against cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). Sixty consecutive PAH patients and 20 normals were examined with 3DE and CMR. RV end-diastolic volumes (EDV), end-systolic (ESV), stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF), and mass were measured in all patients and in normals. Two independent observers assessed variability using the Bland-Altman analysis agreement. RV volumes (in mL) and mass were similar between 3DE and CMR in PAH patients: [EDV (in mL) 183.2 +/- 38 vs. 187.3 +/- 41, P = 0.32; ESV (in mL) 122 +/- 33 vs. 126 +/- 36, P = 0.99; SV (in mL) 63 +/- 15 vs. 65 +/- 19, P = 0.06; EF (in %) 33 +/- 7 vs. 31 +/- 9, P = 0.16 and RV mass (g) 99 +/- 20 vs. 96 +/- 22, P = 0.42], respectively. Interobserver variability was similar between 3DE and CMR in PAH for all variables, with CMR showing less interobserver variability for EDV compared with 3DE in both patients and normals (patients: mean bias: CMR-EDV: 0.4 +/- 16 mL vs. 3DE-EDV: 6.9 +/- 17.9 and in normals: CMR-EDV: 0.1 +/- 9.8 vs. 3DE-EDV: 5.7 +/- 16.3, respectively), whereas EF and RV mass were poorly reproducible with no correlation between observers for 3DE and CMR. RV remodelling in PAH patients can be accurately assessed with both 3DE and CMR. Both modalities are robust and reproducible with CMR being more reproducible for measurements of EF and RV mass.

[Prevention and control of substance abuse in the workplace: a new and significant opportunity for the occupational physician]. Substance abuse is nowadays a recurrent theme in the daily practice of occupational physicians (OP), mainly owing to recent legislation prescribing mandatory assessments for workers performing job tasks involving danger to third parties. While some degree of bureaucracy is inevitable and legislation seems to be inclined towards deterrence, it is recommended to take advantage of the opportunities offered for practical interventions which, in accordance with science and ethics, the OP can carry out in the workplace. Risk assessment, health surveillance, fitness for work, health promotion and cooperation in management issues are the areas of intervention required for the OP to fully accomplish his role in the practice of modern occupational health. We propose specific activities for the OP so as to highlight roles and obligations, based on available scientific evidence and established codes of ethics. Lastly, we wish to emphasize the overall role of the OP in taking on responsibilities shared jointly with all the parties and in the approach to the substance abuse problem in all workplaces with the ultimate goal of acting for the benefit of workers, enterprises and society in general.

Regioisomer compositions of vaccenic and oleic acid containing triacylglycerols in sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) pulp oils: influence of origin and weather conditions. Triacylglycerols (TAGs) 16:1(n-7)/16:1(n-7)/18:1(n-7) (Po/Po/V) and 16:1(n-7)/16:1(n-7)/18:1(n-9) (Po/Po/O) in pulp/peel oils of various sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides) subspecies and varieties were separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. The regioisomerism of the TAGs was determined by tandem mass spectrometry using ammonia supplemented in the nebulizer gas to produce ammonium adducts. The regioisomer compositions of Po/Po/V (8-24% of PoVPo) and Po/Po/O (43-61% of PoOPo) both differed from the random distribution of fatty acids (33.3% of ABA) in all 32 sea buckthorn samples investigated. The regioisomer compositions were different between cultivated ssp. rhamnoides varieties, wild ssp. rhamnoides, and wild ssp. sinensis. Differences were also found in the regioisomerism of both Po/Po/V and Po/Po/O between the two cultivated ssp. rhamnoides varieties, Tytti and Terhi. In addition, growth location and harvesting years showed clear impacts on the regioisomer compositions of Po/Po/V and Po/Po/O. Higher temperatures showed positive correlations with the proportion of PoOPo in ssp. rhamnoides and wild ssp. sinensis and with the proportion of sn-PoPoV+sn-VPoPo in wild ssp. sinensis. However, higher temperatures, higher temperature sums, and radiation sums increased the accumulation of PoVPo in wild ssp. rhamnoides.


Mitochondrial autophagy promotes cellular injury in nephropathic cystinosis.

Children at risk for developmental delay can be recognised by stunting, being underweight, ill health, little maternal schooling or high gravidity. To investigate markers of risk status that can be easily monitored in resource-limited settings for the identification of children in need of early developmental intervention. Eighty-five children in Kilifi, Kenya, aged between 2 and 10 months at recruitment, were involved in a 10-month follow-up. Data on developmental outcome were collected through parental report using a locally developed checklist. We tested for the unique and combined influence of little maternal schooling and higher gravidity, anthropometric status (being underweight and stunting) and poor health on the level of developmental achievement and the rate of acquisition of developmental milestones. A model with all five predictors showed a good fit to the data (chi(2)(21, N = 85) = 23.00, p = .33). Maternal schooling and gravidity and child's stunting were found to predict the rate of developmental achievements (beta = .24, beta = .31, and beta = .41, respectively). Being underweight, ill-health, stunting and gravidity predicted initial developmental status (beta = -.26, beta = -.27, beta = -.43, and beta = -.27). Slow rates of developmental achievement can be predicted using these easy-to-administer measures and the strongest relationship with risk was based on a combination of all measures.

The GnRH Antagonist Degarelix Directly Inhibits Benign Prostate Hyperplasia Cell Growth. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptors (GnRHR) have been found in extrapituitary tissues, including the prostate, where they might exert a local effect on tissue growth. Degarelix is a GnRHR antagonist approved for use in patients with prostate cancer (PCa) who need androgen deprivation therapy. The slowing of prostate cell growth is a common goal shared by PCa and benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) patients, and the effect of degarelix on BPH cells has not yet been investigated. We wanted to evaluate the direct effect of degarelix on human BPH primary cell growth. Gene expression studies performed with BPH (n=11), stage 0 (n=15), and PCa (n=65) human specimens demonstrated the presence of GNRHR1 and GNRHR2 and their respective endogenous peptide ligands. BPH-isolated epithelial and stromal cells were either cultured alone or co-cultured (1:4 or 4:1 ratio of epithelial to stromal cells) and subsequently treated with increasing concentrations of degarelix. Degarelix treatment induced a decrease in cell viability and cell proliferation rates, which occurred in parallel to an increase in apoptosis. Both epithelial and stromal BPH cells are sensitive to degarelix treatment and, interestingly, degarelix is also effective when the cells were growing in a co-culture microenvironment. In contrast to degarelix, the GnRHR agonists, leuprolide and goserelin, exerted no effect on the viability of BPH epithelial or stromal cells. In conclusion, (i) prostate tissues express GNRHR and are a potential target for degarelix; and (ii) degarelix directly inhibits BPH cell growth through a decrease in cell proliferation and an increase in apoptosis.

High diversity of hepatitis C viral quasispecies is associated with early virological response in patients undergoing antiviral therapy. Differential response patterns to optimal antiviral therapy, peginterferon alpha plus ribavirin, are well documented in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Among many factors that may affect therapeutic efficiency, HCV quasispecies (QS) characteristics have been a major focus of previous studies, yielding conflicting results. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of the role of HCV QS in antiviral therapy, we performed the largest-ever HCV QS analysis in 153 patients infected with HCV genotype 1 strains. A total of 4,314 viral clones spanning hypervarible region 1 were produced from these patients during the first 12 weeks of therapy, followed by detailed genetic analyses. Our data show an exponential distribution pattern of intrapatient QS diversity in this study population in which most patients (63%) had small QS diversity with genetic distance (d) less than 0.2. The group of patients with genetic distance located in the decay region (d>0.53) had a significantly higher early virologic response (EVR) rate (89.5%), which contributed substantially to the overall association between EVR and increased baseline QS diversity. In addition, EVR was linked to a clustered evolutionary pattern in terms of QS dynamic changes. EVR is associated with elevated HCV QS diversity and complexity, especially in patients with significantly higher HCV genetic heterogeneity.

[Ethical considerations on new developments in reproductive medicine]. Reproduction and the family are central elements in the lives of people, and in the narratives and practices of diverse cultures and societies. In the development of ever more powerful techniques of assisted reproduction a number of questions have emerged. They lie at the heart of what it means to reproduce, to be a parent, to be a human being. Reproductive technologies and their consideration influence perceptions and practices in regard to reproduction and beyond, thus embodying anthropological implications for the understanding of family, motherhood, health, offspring, responsibility and others. Technological capabilities and socio-cultural perceptions are strongly intertwined. The role of bioethics in this context is to explore human nascency as a process. To better understand this process and its implications for human life both medical and social, we suggest considering different perspectives on reproductive technologies to widen our understanding. These perspectives range from the potential child and its parents to health care professionals and the state. In expanding our perception of reproduction, social scientific methods can help to situate philosophical and ethical issues, thus rendering bioethical examination of reproductive technologies more socially robust. In this paper, we provide an overview of several bioethical key themes in assisted reproduction: methodological questions in regard to providing better understanding of this field, selective and inclusive social aspects of assisted reproduction, financial and governance considerations, and an applied consideration of the IVF research interface.

Characterizing contract-based multiagent resource allocation in networks. We consider a multiagent resource allocation problem where individual users intend to route traffic by requesting the help of entities across a network, and a cost is incurred at each network node that depends on the amount of traffic to be routed. We propose to study contract-based network resource allocation. In our model, users and nodes in the network make contracts before nodes route traffic for the users. The problem is an interesting self-interested negotiation problem because it requires the complete assembly of a set of distinct resources, and there are multiple combinations of distinct resources that could satisfy the goal of negotiation. First, we characterize the network allocation problem and show that finding optimal allocations is NP-complete and is inapproximable. We take both Nash equilibrium and pairwise Nash equilibrium as the solution concepts to characterize the equilibrium allocations. We find that, for any resource allocation game, Nash equilibrium and pairwise Nash equilibrium always exist. In addition, socially optimal allocations are always supported by Nash equilibrium and pairwise Nash equilibrium. We introduce best-response dynamics in which each agent takes a myopic best-response strategy and interacts with each other to dynamically form contracts. We analyze the convergence of the dynamics in some special cases. We also experimentally study the convergence rate of the dynamics and how efficient the evolved allocation is as compared with the optimal allocation in a variety of environments.

The association of lifetime education with the prevalence of myocardial infarction: an analysis of the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Socioeconomic status is likely an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease but little research has been done in the United States to study this association in a nationally representative sample. We sought to determine the association between lifetime education and the prevalence of myocardial infarction (MI) among adults over the age of 39 in the US. A cross sectional study was conducted using the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). A multivariable logistic regression was performed. The analysis was conducted in 2008. Among respondents aged 40 years and older to the 2006 BRFSS survey those with less than a high school education had 3.09 (95% CI: 2.79-3.43) times the odds of having had an MI compared to college graduates. After adjusting for confounders, respondents with less than a high school education had 1.61 (95% CI: 1.41-1.83) times the odds of having had an MI compared to college graduates. Both those with a high school education and those who completed some college or technical school had 1.22 times the odds of having had an MI compared to college graduates after adjusting for confounders. This study suggests that education is a risk factor for MI. More national prospective studies are needed in the US to better understand the link between socioeconomic status and coronary heart disease.

[Intraoperative Endoscopic Evaluation of the Aortic Valve in Aortic Valve Repair]. This report discusses intraoperative endoscopic evaluation of the aortic valve performed in 2 cases of aortic valve repair. The "direct" or real image by the endoscopy helped to confirm the preoperatively-known lesion and even to detect a new legion which was not detected preoperatively. The endoscopy also enabled the evaluation of the aortic valve under the pressure-loaded condition without releasing the aortic clamp. Postoperative aortic regurgitation was grade I or less in both cases, although it progressed to grade II at 1 year in case 2. Echocardiographic parameters demonstrated no change in the size of the aortic root configuration for 8 and 5 years in case 1 and case 2, respectively. Intraoperative aortic endoscopy was useful to define the pathogenesis of aortic regurgitation and to evaluate the cusp repair procedures, which may contribute to a good mid-term result of aortic valve repair.

Effects of female sex hormones and contraceptive pill on the diagnostic work-up for primary aldosteronism. Due to the widespread use of the aldosterone to renin ratio (ARR), primary aldosteronism is currently recognized as a frequent cause of secondary hypertension. After a positive screening, primary aldosteronism diagnosis needs confirmation by an inhibitory test such as intravenous saline load (ivSLT). The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of female hormones in primary aldosteronism diagnosis, by evaluating possible differences by sex on ARR screening, on the rate of ivSLT response and analyzing the influence of free and oral contraceptive-induced menstrual cycle on ARR. We examined ARR in 103 healthy normotensive volunteers, 81 hypertensive patients who underwent ivSLT, 33 healthy women during free menstrual cycle and after oral contraceptive therapy. A significantly higher proportion of normotensive women than men had an elevated ARR (13.6 versus 2.3%, P < 0.05). In 44 out of 81 hypertensive patients, diagnosis of primary aldosteronism was confirmed by ivSLT. Patients with positive and negative ivSLT differed only for sex distribution: 85.2% of men had the primary aldosteronism diagnosis confirmed, compared with 38.9% of women. In healthy women, renin and aldosterone concentrations increased from the follicular to luteal phase of menstrual period, with unchanged ARR. By contrast, renin nearly halved, aldosterone slightly decreased and ARR doubled after oral contraceptive therapy. ARR screening fails to predict positive ivSLT in most (60.2%) hypertensive women as compared with 14.8% of hypertensive men. ARR is more often increased in normotensive women than men. Oral contraceptive may affect ARR contributing to the diagnostic inaccuracy in women.

The efficiency of progesterone vaginal gel versus intramuscular progesterone for luteal phase supplementation in gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonist cycles: a prospective clinical trial. We compared the efficiency of progesterone vaginal gel (PVG) with intramuscular progesterone (IMP) supplementation for luteal phase support after in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer in gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist cycles. The treatment outcomes were similar for PVG and IMP for luteal support in GnRH-antagonist protocols. With its ease of use, high tolerability by patients, and fewer side effects, PVG can be a successful alternative to IMP.

Rational design and construction of an efficient E. coli for production of diapolycopendioic acid. We applied elementary mode analysis to a recombinant metabolic network of carotenoid-producing E. coli in order to identify multiple-gene knockouts for an enhanced synthesis of the carotenoids diapolycopendial (DPL) and diapolycopendioic acid (DPA). Based on the model, all inefficient carotenoid biosynthesis pathways were eliminated in a strain containing a combination of eight gene deletions. To validate the model prediction, the designed strain was constructed and tested for its performance. The designed mutant produces the carotenoids at significantly increased yields and rates as compared to the wild-type. The consistency between model prediction and experimental results demonstrates that elementary mode analysis is useful as a guiding tool also for the rational strain design of more complex pathways for secondary metabolite production.

Ligand exchange effects in gold nanoparticle assembly induced by oxidative stress biomarkers: homocysteine and cysteine. The interactions of oxidative stress biomarkers: homocysteine (Hcys) and cysteine (Cys) with the multifunctional gold nanoparticles, important in view of novel biomedical applications in diagnostics and therapy, have been investigated using resonance elastic light scattering (RELS), UV-Vis plasmonic spectroscopy, and high-resolution TEM imaging. The Hcys-induced assembly of gold nanoparticles has been observed for non-ionic surfactant-capped gold nanoparticles as well as for negatively-charged citrate-capped gold nanoparticles. We have observed for the first time the de-aggregation of citrate-capped gold nanoparticle ensembles followed by their conversion to citrate-linked Hcys-capped nanoparticle assemblies. The Cys molecules, which are smaller than Hcys by only one CH(2) group, show much less activity. The mechanisms leading to this intriguing disparity in the abilities of these two thioaminoacids to ligand exchange with surfactant- or citrate-capping molecules of the gold nanoparticle shells are proposed on the basis of the experimental evidence, molecular dynamics simulations, and quantum mechanical calculations. For citrate-capped gold nanoparticles, we postulate the formation of surface complexes facilitated by electrostatic attractions and formation of double hydrogen bonds for both Hcys and Cys. The conformational differences between these two kinds of complexes result in marked differences in the distance between -SH groups of the biomarkers to the gold surface and different abilities to induce nanoparticle assembly. Analytical implications of these mechanistic differences are discussed.

Evolution of the solvent polarity in an electrospray plume. Solvent polarity plays an important role in electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS), one of the most widely used analytical methods for biochemistry. To have a comprehensive understanding of how solvent polarity affects ESI-MS measurements, we systematically investigated the polarity change in the ESI plume formed from an ethanol solution using laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectroscopy. Two solvatochromic dyes (i.e., dyes whose fluorescence emission is sensitive to solvent polarity), Nile red and DCM (4-dicyanomethylene-2-methyl-6-p-dimethylaminostyryl-4H-pyran), were used as probes. The peak emission wavelengths of these two dyes exhibited significant red shifts (8-12 nm) when the measuring spot was moved away from the spray tip and in radial direction in the plume, indicating a dramatic polarity change during shrinking of the droplets. The emission intensities were also measured with a polarity-insensitive dye as a reference. The results are consistent with the peak wavelength measurements. Two key mechanisms responsible for the change of solvent polarity in the plume were considered, water entrainment from the surrounding air and solvent evaporation. Furthermore, quantitative analysis of the solvent polarity change was performed by using the Lippert-Mataga polarity parameter Deltaf. The value of Deltaf reached 0.305-0.307 at the periphery of the ESI plume, which means that the solvent polarity in the smaller droplet is close to that of a mixture of 30% water and 70% ethanol (Deltaf = 0.307), even though the bulk solvent was ethanol containing less than 1% water as an impurity.

Drugs that suppress TSH or cause central hypothyroidism. Many different drugs affect thyroid function. Most of these drugs act at the level of the thyroid in patients with normal thyroid function, or at the level of thyroid hormone absorption or metabolism in patients requiring exogenous levothyroxine. A small subset of medications including glucocorticoids, dopamine agonists, somatostatin analogues and rexinoids affect thyroid function through suppression of TSH in the thyrotrope or hypothalamus. Fortunately, most of these medications do not cause clinically evident central hypothyroidism. A newer class of nuclear hormone receptors agonists, called rexinoids, cause clinically significant central hypothyroidism in most patients and dopamine agonists may exacerbate 'hypothyroidism' in patients with non-thyroidal illness. In this review, we explore mechanisms governing TSH suppression of these drugs and the clinical relevance of these effects.

Is the introduction of violence and injury observatories associated with a reduction of violence in adult populations? Rationale and protocol for a systematic review. The violence and injury observatories developed in Colombia and found throughout the Americas and Western Europe aim to maximise inter-institutional cooperation, information-sharing, analysis and security policy development initiatives to enhance governance. The purpose of the violence and injury observatories is directed towards preventing crime and violence at the local and regional levels. To date, there has been no systematic review of the literature to present a succinct review of the evidence. We therefore sought to summarise the evidence from existing studies on the contribution of violence and injury observatories towards violence prevention. A number of databases will be searched, supplemented by the same keyword searches in the grey literature. Search terms will include studies published from 1 January 1990 to 30 October 2014. Study quality will be assessed using a validated quality assessment tool. Two researchers will independently assess articles for study eligibility to reduce bias, minimise errors and enhance the reliability of findings. Disagreements will be resolved by consensus among three authors. This review protocol has been published in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of systematic reviews, registration number 2014:CRD42014009818. There is a paucity of evidence for the effectiveness of violence and injury observatories and their influence on violence in an adult population. We plan to address this gap in knowledge by way of a systematic review and meta-analysis outlined in this abstract. We anticipate that the results could be used by researchers and policymakers to help inform them of the efficacy of violence and injury observatories and their broader role in contributing to violence prevention.

MMP-9 and CD68(+) cells are required for tissue remodeling in response to natural hydroxyapatite. Large bone defects represent major clinical problems in the practice of reconstructive orthopedic and craniofacial surgery. The aim of this study was to examine, through immunohistochemistry approach, the involvement of MMP-9 and CD68(+) cells during tissue remodeling in response to natural hydroxyapatite (HA) implanted in rat subcutaneous tissue. Before experimentation, forty animals were randomly distributed into two experimental groups: Group-I (Gen-Ox micro-granules) and Group-II (Gen-Ox macro-granules). Afterwards, the biopsies were collected after 10, 20, 30, and 60 days post-implantation. Our results showed that at 10 days, a low-renewal foreign body type granuloma formation was observed in most of the cases. Macrophage- and fibroblast-like cells were the predominant type of cells positively stained for MMP-9 in both groups. Once macrophage-like cells seemed to be the major source of MMP9, antibody against pan-CD68 epitope was used to correlate these findings. In agreement, MMP-9 and CD68(+) cells were distributed at the periphery and the central region of the granuloma in all experimental periods, however no staining was observed in cell contacting to material. Besides macrophages, the lysosomal glycoprotein epitope recognized by CD68 antibodies can be expressed by mast cell granules and sometimes by fibroblasts. Taken together, our results suggest that xenogenic HA promotes extracellular matrix remodeling through induction of MMP-9 activity and presence of CD68(+) cells.

Mercury concentrations in surface water and harvested waterfowl from the prairie pothole region of Saskatchewan. Mercury cycling in prairie ecosystems is poorly understood. We examined methylmercury (MeHg) concentrations in whole water from 49 diverse prairie wetlands and lakes in Saskatchewan. We also determined total Hg (THg) concentrations in waterfowl harvested by hunters for consumption. Average whole water MeHg concentrations ranged from 0.02 to over 4 ng L(-1) and were higher in water from wetland ponds compared to those in lakes. High MeHg concentrations in prairie wetlands present the possibility of increased Hg concentrations in biota inhabiting these and other similar systems. We therefore measured THg in 72 birds representing 13 species of waterfowl that commonly use prairie aquatic habitats. A large range in THg concentrations was observed among individual birds, with values ranging from below the detection limit to over 435 ng g(-1). When waterfowl were classified according to diet, we observed clear evidence of THg biomagnification with increasing proportion of animal prey consumed. THg concentrations in waterfowl collected by hunters did not exceed consumption guidelines of 0.5 mg kg(-1) developed for fish. This is the first study that has reported MeHg concentrations in water from the prairie pothole region of southern Saskatchewan.

[Review of research design and statistical methods in Chinese Journal of Cardiology]. To evaluate the research design and the use of statistical methods in Chinese Journal of Cardiology. Peer through the research design and statistical methods in all of the original papers in Chinese Journal of Cardiology from December 2007 to November 2008. The most frequently used research designs are cross-sectional design (34%), prospective design (21%) and experimental design (25%). In all of the articles, 49 (25%) use wrong statistical methods, 29 (15%) lack some sort of statistic analysis, 23 (12%) have inconsistencies in description of methods. There are significant differences between different statistical methods (P < 0.001). The correction rates of multifactor analysis were low and repeated measurement datas were not used repeated measurement analysis. Many problems exist in Chinese Journal of Cardiology. Better research design and correct use of statistical methods are still needed. More strict review by statistician and epidemiologist is also required to improve the literature qualities.

[Coronary artery and myocardium lesion comparison post atrioventricular ring radiofrequency catheter ablation with different catheters]. To analyze the extent of myocardium and coronary artery lesion post atrioventricular ring radiofrequency catheter ablation with different tip catheters. Twenty-one healthy dogs were randomly divided into 64 degrees C/50 W/100 s, 64 degrees C/100 W/100 s, 45 degrees C/45 W/100 s groups and ablated by 4 mm tip catheter, 8 mm tip catheter and irrigated tip catheter respectively. Left atrioventricular ring and right atrioventricular ring ablation were performed in all dogs. After ablation, myocardium lesion volume was calculated as 1/6pi x length x width x depth. Histological examinations were performed at the myocardium tissue at ablation sites. The lesion depths post 8 mm tip catheter ablation (7.18 +/- 1.72) mm and irrigated tip catheter ablation (7.99 +/- 1.77) mm were similar and significantly deeper than that post 4 mm tip catheter ablation (4.54 +/- 1.38) mm, P < 0.01. Similar results were found in terms of lesion volume [(356.76 +/- 94.44) mm(3) post 8 mm tip catheter ablation, (391.69 +/- 109.54) mm(3) post irrigated tip catheter ablation and (191.34 +/- 74.52) mm(3) post 4 mm tip catheter ablation]. Five (5/42, 11.9%) transmural myocardium necrosis and 8 (8/42, 19%) coronary artery lesions were observed post ablations. The extents of post ablation myocardium and coronary artery lesion were significantly higher induced by 8 mm tip catheter and irrigate tip catheter compared those by 4 mm tip catheter.

Finite element analysis of forearm crutches during gait in children with myelomeningocele. A finite element analysis of a commercial forearm crutch for children during gait is presented. The geometric features of the crutch structure were acquired and modeled. The finite element model was created using shell elements based on the frame surfaces. Linear elastic material properties for aluminum alloy were utilized. Upper extremity kinetic data from reciprocal and swing-through gait patterns were applied to the model as boundary conditions and loads. Stress distributions during two gait patterns were determined. Stress distributions during swing-through gait were found to be statistically greater than those during reciprocal gait (p = 0.01). This work provides novel quantitative data to improve crutch design and stimulate further analyses of upper extremity joint loads during forearm crutch-assisted gait in children with myelomeningocele (spina bifida).

Myocardial bridging and coronary artery anomalies detected by ECG-gated 64-row multidetector computed tomography angiography in symptomatic patients. Advances in 64-row multidetector computed tomography have provided noninvasive imaging of coronary arteries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of coronary artery anomalies in Iranian symptomatic patients and to determine the presence of anomalies resulting in myocardial ischaemia without atherosclerotic plaque. This study was carried out in Tabriz University of medical sciences on 534 patients with suggestive symptoms for coronary artery diseases. Original slices were reconstructed from data achieved by using a ECG-gated multidetector computed tomography scanner, and reconstructed 3-dimentional images of the heart were reviewed. Congenital angiography was performed in 36.3% of patients. The prevalence of myocardial bridging in symptomatic patients was 6.0% by multidetector computed tomography while conventional angiography could detect 20% of them. The most prevalent site was the middle portion of the left anterior descending artery. Anomalous origin or course of coronary arteries and AV fistula was detected by multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography in 2.6% of cases while conventional angiography could detect 44.4% of these anomalies. The prevalence of atherosclerotic plaques in patients with myocardial bridging was 53.1%. In 46.9% of these patients, myocardial bridging was held responsible for signs and symptoms of myocardial ischaemia as no atherosclerotic plaque was evident. This rate was 64.3% in symptomatic patients with other anomalies in origin or course of coronary arteries. This study gives the prevalence of coronary artery anomalies and myocardial bridging in the Iranian population. The results suggest multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography as the preferred utility for diagnosing such anomalies.

Boxed molecular dynamics: a simple and general technique for accelerating rare event kinetics and mapping free energy in large molecular systems. We present a simple, comprehensive technique for accelerating simulation of rare events and calculating free energy profiles in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The technique is based on two related and complementary methods (AXD and BXD), which provide both thermodynamic and kinetic information along some reaction coordinate. The idea is to slice the reaction coordinate into several "boxes", and then run trajectories, locking them consecutively within each box to generate kinetic rate coefficients for exchange between neighboring boxes. In this way, a reaction coordinate may be efficiently explored, including those regions that would otherwise be visited only rarely. Combined with a simple and exact method for renormalizing the statistics obtained within each box, the box-to-box rate coefficients permit efficient free energy mapping. Tests carried out on model peptides demonstrate the utility of the method as well as the validity of the detailed balance assumption that underpins the derivations.

Tetramethylsuccinimide as a directing/protecting group in purine glycosylations. Tetramethylsuccinic anhydride can be used to protect the exocyclic amine of 6-aminopurine derivatives by forming the corresponding tetramethysuccinimide. X-ray crystallography confirms that the imide carbonyl and the methyl groups are positioned to sterically block the N7 nitrogen so that glycosylations occur with very high regiochemical control at N9. This approach is particularly effective for 3-substituted purines where the substituent tends to block access to N9 and inhibit glycosylation at that site.

[Tenodesis in hand surgery]. Joining tendon's inextensibility with joint's mobility, a tenodesis fixes on the bones the two ends of a tendon on both sides of one or several joints. A "simple" tenodesis overrides only one joint, whereas a "dynamic" tenodesis crosses two or more joints. A "crossed" dynamic tenodesis crosses the line which joins rotation axes. A "direct" dynamic tenodesis is located on the same side of this line. The "tenodesis effect" is normally produced by the movements of the joint on the neighbouring tendons. Anatomical examples are given by the oblique retinacular ligaments (crossed dynamic tenodesis), and by the tenodesis effects linked to the flexion-extension of the wrist on the extrinsic tendons of the fingers (direct tenodesis effect), or to the flexion-extension of the PIP joints on the intrinsic tendons of the fingers (crossed tenodesis effect). Main tenodesis techniques are used for palliative surgery in paralysis of EDC, intrinsic muscles of the fingers, or extrinsic muscles of the thumb (EPL, FPL, APL and EPB).

The orthotopic Fischer/AY-27 rat bladder urothelial cell carcinoma model to test the efficacy of different apaziquone formulations. Apaziquone used intravesically showed significant activity in phase I and II marker lesion studies in non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer. The objective of this study was to assess antitumor activity and safety of 3 different formulations of intravesical apaziquone in an orthotopic rat bladder cancer model. Female Fischer F344 rats were instilled with 1.5 Ã 10(6) AY-27 urothelial cell carcinoma cells and divided in 3 treatment groups (n = 10) and 1 placebo group (n = 6). Intravesical treatment was administered for 1 hour on days 2 and 5. Rats were treated with apaziquone in the formulation used in phase I/II clinical trials (group 1); apaziquone with an altered buffering capacity being used in phase III clinical trials (group 2), and apaziquone as in group 2, but without propylene glycol in the diluent (group 3). On days 5 and 14, the bladder wall was inspected by cystoscopy and evaluated for macroscopic tumor growth. After sacrificing the rats (day 14), cystectomy was performed and the bladders were investigated. There were no signs of any toxicity due to the study drug. On histopathologic examination of the bladders 0, 1, and 2 tumors per group were found in group 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In the placebo-treated group, 60% of animals developed tumor, which is comparable to untreated animals. Apaziquone showed an excellent antitumor activity. The effectiveness of apaziquone in this orthotopic rat bladder tumor model corroborates the clinical observations and implies the validity of this model.

Psychometric properties of the Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised among community-dwelling current drinkers in the Ningxia autonomous region of China. The 20-item Drinking Motives Questionnaire-Revised (DMQ-R)-which assesses social, enhancement, coping and conformity-related motives for drinking-has not previously been used in China. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the psychometric properties of the DMQ-R in China. DMQ-R was administered to 612 current drinkers identified from a representative sample of 2425 non-institutionalised adults living in Ningxia Province, China; 44 of these current drinkers were re-administered the questionnaire an average of 2.5 days later. Confirmatory factor analysis compared the adequacy of fit of alternative conceptual models. Due to the collectivist culture in China, we considered the possibility that item 12 ('to fit in the group I like') is an indicator of a 'social' motive (in Western studies, it is an indicator of a 'conformity' motive). Social motives for drinking were more frequently endorsed than other motives. The intraclass correlation coefficients for the test-retest reliability of the four subscales varied from 0.63 to 0.80. The originally conceptualised four-factor model showed good fit to the data [root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA)â=â0.043, comparative fit indexâ=â0.949 and Tucker-Lewis indexâ=â0.941]. Fit indices improved (RSMEAâ=â0.034, comparative fit indexâ=â0.968 and Tucker-Lewis indexâ=â0.963) when item 12 was included in the 'social' dimension rather than the 'conformity' dimension. The 12-item short form of DMQ-R showed similar psychometric properties, but the fit indices were suboptimal. DMQ-R is a valid and reliable tool to assess drinking motives among current drinkers in China. Future studies in China using the DMQ-R should consider item 12 a social motive.

Variation in human performance in the hypoxic mountain environment. Ascent to altitude is associated with a fall in barometric pressure, and with it a decline in the partial pressure of atmospheric (and thus alveolar) oxygen. As a result, a variety of adaptive physiological processes are engaged to mitigate the fall in tissue convective oxygen delivery which might otherwise occur. The magnitude and nature of such changes is also modified with time, a process known as acclimatization. However, other phenomena are at work; the ability to perform physical work at altitude falls in a manner which is not wholly related to changes in arterial oxygen content. Indeed, alterations in local skeletal muscle blood flow and metabolism may play an axial role. Thus, for those who are not native to high altitude, the ability to compete at altitude is likely to be impaired. The magnitude of such impairment in performance, however, differs greatly between individuals, and it seems that genetic variation underpins much of this difference. The identification of the relevant genetic elements is in its infancy in humans, but ongoing work is likely to help us gain an increasing understanding of how humans adapt to altitude and to develop mitigating interventions.

Seizure detection: an assessment of time- and frequency-based features in a unified two-dimensional decisional space using nonlinear decision functions. This study proposes a new approach for offline seizure detection in intracranial (subdural) electroencephalogram recordings using nonlinear decision functions. It implements well-established features that are designed to deal with complex signals, such as brain recordings, and proposes a two-dimensional (2D) domain of analysis that overcomes the dilemma faced with the selection of empirical thresholds often used to delineate epileptic events. This unifying approach makes it possible for researchers in epilepsy to establish other performance evaluation criteria on the basis of the proposed nonlinear decision functions as well as introduce additional dimensions toward multidimensional analysis because the mathematics of these decision functions allows for any number of dimensions and any degree of complexity. Furthermore, because the features considered assume both time and frequency domains, the analysis is performed both temporally and as a function of different frequency ranges to ascertain those measures that are most suitable for seizure detection. In retrospect, by using nonlinear decision functions and by establishing a unified 2D domain of analysis, this study establishes a generalized approach to seizure detection that works across several features and across patients. Clinical experiments involved 14 patients with intractable seizures that were evaluated for potential surgical interventions. Of the total 157 files considered, 35 (21 interictal and 14 ictal) intracranial electroencephalogram data files or 22% were used initially in a training phase to ascertain the reliability of the formulated features that were implemented in the seizure detection process. The remaining 122 intracranial electroencephalogram data files or 78% were then used in the testing phase to assess the merits of each feature considered as means to detect a seizure. The testing phase using the remaining 122 intracranial electroencephalogram data files revealed that the gamma power in the frequency domain is the feature that performed best across all patients with a sensitivity of 96.296%, an accuracy of 96.721%, and a specificity of 96.842%. The second best feature in the time domain was the mobility with a sensitivity of 81.481% an accuracy of 90.169%, and a specificity of 92.632%. In the frequency domain, all of the five other spectral bands lesser than 36 Hz revealed mixed results in terms of low sensitivity in some frequency bands and low accuracy in other frequency bands, which is expected given that the dominant frequencies during an ictal state are those higher than 30 Hz. In the time domain, other features, including complexity and correlation sum, revealed mixed success. All the features that are based on the time domain performed well, with mobility being the optimal feature for seizure detection. In the frequency domain, the gamma power outperformed the other frequency bands. Within this 2D plane, the best results were also observed when the degree of complexity is 3 or 4 in the implementation of the proposed nonlinear decision functions. : A singular contribution of this study is in creating a common 2D space for analysis through the use of nonlinear decision functions for delineating data clusters of ictal files from data clusters of interictal files. This is critically important in establishing unifying measures that work across different features as expressed by the weight vector of the decision functions for a standardized assessment. The mathematical foundation is consequently established in support of a generalized seizure detection algorithm that works across patients, and in which all type of features that have been amply tested in the literature could be assessed within the realm of nonlinear decision functions.

Evaluation of a robotic arm for echocardiography to X-ray image registration during cardiac catheterization procedures. We present an initial evaluation of a robotic arm for positioning a 3D echo probe during cardiac catheterization procedures. By tracking the robotic arm, X-ray table and X-ray C-arm, we are able to register the 3D echo images with live 2D X-ray images. In addition, we can also use tracking data from the robotic arm combined with system calibrations to create extended field of view 3D echo images. Both these features can be used for roadmapping to guide cardiac catheterization procedures. We have carried out a validation experiment of our registration method using a cross-wire phantom. Results show our method to be accurate to 3.5 mm. We have successfully demonstrated the creation of the extended field of view data on 2 healthy volunteers and the registration of echo and X-ray data on 1 patient undergoing a pacing study.

The role of catheter balloon commissurotomy for severe mitral stenosis in pregnancy. Mitral stenosis is one of the more commonly seen valve lesions encountered in pregnancy. The pathophysiologic implications, management strategies, and a comprehensive review of literature over the past 20 years for optimal timing of catheter balloon commissurotomy during pregnancy are discussed. Mechanical relief of obstruction is indicated for cases of severe symptomatic mitral stenosis in pregnancy refractory to medical therapy. Catheter balloon commissurotomy is the procedure of choice in a select group of these patients with suitable valve morphology.

Morphology engineering of Aspergillus niger for improved enzyme production.

Manipulation of amino acid composition in soybean seeds by the combination of deregulated tryptophan biosynthesis and storage protein deficiency. The ability of genetic manipulation to yield greatly increased concentrations of free amino acids (FAAs) in seeds of soybean was evaluated by introduction of a feedback-insensitive mutant enzyme of tryptophan (Trp) biosynthesis into two transformation-competent breeding lines deficient in major seed storage proteins. The storage protein-deficient lines exhibited increased accumulation of certain other seed proteins as well as of FAAs including arginine (Arg) and asparagine in mature seeds. Introduction of the gene for a feedback-insensitive mutant of an alpha subunit of rice anthranilate synthase (OASA1D) into the two high-FAA breeding lines by particle bombardment resulted in a >10-fold increase in the level of free Trp in mature seeds compared with that in nontransgenic seeds. The amount of free Trp in these transgenic seeds was similar to that in OASA1D transgenic seeds of the wild-type cultivar Jack. The composition of total amino acids in seeds of the high-FAA breeding lines remained largely unaffected by the expression of OASA1D with the exception of an increase in the total Trp content. Our results therefore indicate that the extra nitrogen resource originating from storage protein deficiency was used exclusively for the synthesis of inherent alternative nitrogen reservoirs such as free Arg and not for deregulated Trp biosynthesis conferred by OASA1D. The intrinsic null mutations responsible for storage protein deficiency and the OASA1D transgene affecting Trp content were thus successfully combined and showed additive effects on the amino acid composition of soybean seeds.

Decline in age at menarche among Spanish women born from 1925 to 1962. While the timing of reproductive events varies across populations, a downward trend in age at menarche has nevertheless been reported in most of the developed world over the past century. Given the impact of change in age at menarche on health conditions, this study sought to examine secular trends in age at menarche among women living in Navarre (Northern Spain) who participated in a population-based breast cancer screening programme. The study was based on 110545 women born from 1925 to 1962. Trends were tested using a linear regression model, in which year of birth was entered continuously as the predictor and age at menarche (years) as the response variable, using size of town and region of birth as covariates. Among women born in Navarre between 1925 and 1962, age at menarche declined steadily from an average of 13.72 years in the 1925-1929 birth-cohorts to 12.83 years in the 1958-1962 birth-cohorts. Controlling for size of town or city of birth, age at menarche declined by an average of 0.132 years every 5 years over the period 1925-1962. This decline was greater in women born in rural versus urban settings. Trends were also different among regions of birth. We report a population-based study showing a downward trend in age of onset of menarche among Spanish women born in the period 1925-1962, something that is more pronounced among women born in rural settings and varies geographically.

Localization of DNA and RNA in eosinophil secretory granules. Although the accepted paradigm is that the proteins stored in eosinophil crystalloid granules are translated from messenger RNA transcribed in the cell nucleus, recent ultrastructural evidence suggests that protein synthesis may also take place within eosinophilic granules. We used 2 different methods to detect the presence of DNA and RNA in eosinophil secretory granules. Using bromodeoxyuridine, a thymidine analogue, and bromouridine, a uracil analogue, we labeled the DNA and RNA in eosinophils in vivo in rabbits. Immunoelectron microscopy to localize these molecules was performed on ultrathin sections of blood and bone marrow eosinophils using monoclonal anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody with IgG as a control. The immunogold grain density was measured in each subcellular compartment within the eosinophils and analyzed using image analysis software. A combination of DNA/CD63 immunofluorescence staining and a fluorescently labeled molecular probe that stains RNA was used to examine the presence of DNA and RNA in the secretory granules of human blood eosinophils. The mean density of bromodeoxyuridine-labeled DNA and bromouridine-labeled RNA immunogold grains in the secretory granules of blood and bone marrow eosinophils were significantly higher (p < 0.0005) than cytoplasmic or background staining. We also demonstrated the existence of DNA and RNA in the CD63-positive secretory granules of human peripheral blood eosinophils by means of immunofluorescent staining and a fluorescently labeled molecular probe. These results provide evidence that eosinophil granules are the site of DNA and RNA synthesis and suggest the potential for a new role(s) for eosinophil-secretory granules.

[Pulmonary embolism in cancer: clinical analysis of 60 cases]. To enhance the understanding of pulmonary thromboembolism (PTE) in patients with cancer. from January 2005 to July 2008, sixty patients diagnosed as pulmonary thromboembolism in Peking Union Medical College Hospital were retrospectively reviewed. The primary cancers were from respiratory system (36.7%), digestive system (26.7%), urogenital system (10.0%), hematological system (8.3%) and nervous system (5.0%), respectively, especially from such organ as lung (30.0%), stomach (8.3%), pancreas (6.7%), liver (5.0%) and so on. 12 of 18 patients (66.7%) with lung cancer were adenocarcinoma. There were 47 patients (78.3%) with advanced cancer. Deep venous thrombosis (DVT) occurred in 30 patients (50.0%). Of them 24 patients (80.0%) occurred in the lower limb, and 3 patients (10%) in the upper limb, 5 patients (16.7%) in other sites including 2 cases with thrombi in both upper and lower limbs, respectively. There were 2 patients (3.3%) accompanied with femoral artery embolism. PTE before tumor diagnosed occurred in 5 patients (8.3%) with an average time of 5.5 months. 22 patients underwent cancer-related operation and 17 patients (77.3%) had PTE in the later 2 weeks. 15 patients (25.0%) showed no symptoms. Arterial oxygen partial pressure was reduced in 49 patients (84.5%). 13 patients (21.7%) died and 6 cases of them were sudden death. 8 patients (13.3%) aggravated. 39 patients (65.0%) improved. PTE is one of the major complications and leading causes of death in patients with cancer. Of which lung cancer is most commonly, pulmonary adenocarcinoma in particular. PTE is often accompanied by DVT in the lower extremity. Risk factors may be old age, cancer progression and cancer-related operation. Other factors include long time in bed, chemotherapy and central vein catheterization, and so on. It should be watchful of PTE in cancer patients undergoing operation, especially within the first two postoperative weeks. Its clinical manifestation is often atypical. Sometimes venous thromboembolism (VTE) is the first signal of malignancy. In patients with unexplained PTE and/or DVT, attention should be paid to the possibility of malignancy. The first choice of anticoagulants is low molecular weight heparin.

Telavancin and hydroxy propyl-beta-cyclodextrin clearance during continuous renal replacement therapy: an in vitro study.

INCENP-aurora B interactions modulate kinase activity and chromosome passenger complex localization. Dynamic localization of the chromosomal passenger complex (CPC) during mitosis is essential for its diverse functions. CPC targeting to centromeres involves interactions between Survivin, Borealin, and the inner centromere protein (CENP [INCENP]) N terminus. In this study, we investigate how interactions between the INCENP C terminus and aurora B set the level of kinase activity. Low levels of kinase activity, seen in INCENP-depleted cells or in cells expressing a mutant INCENP that cannot bind aurora B, are sufficient for a spindle checkpoint response when microtubules are absent but not against low dose taxol. Intermediate kinase activity levels obtained with an INCENP mutant that binds aurora B but cannot fully activate it are sufficient for a robust response against taxol, but cannot trigger CPC transfer from the chromosomes to the anaphase spindle midzone. This transfer requires significantly higher levels of aurora B activity. These experiments reveal that INCENP interactions with aurora B in vivo modulate the level of kinase activity, thus regulating CPC localization and functions during mitosis.

Purification and characterization of active caspase-14 from human epidermis and development of the cleavage site-directed antibody. Restricted expression of caspase-14 in differentiating keratinocytes suggests the involvement of caspase-14 in terminal differentiation. We purified active caspase-14 from human cornified cells with sequential chromatographic procedures. Specific activity increased 764-fold with a yield of 9.1%. Purified caspase-14 revealed the highest activity on WEHD-methylcoumaryl-amide (MCA), although YVAD-MCA, another caspase-1 substrate, was poorly hydrolyzed. The purified protein was a heterodimer with 17 and 11 kDa subunits. N-terminal and C-terminal analyses demonstrated that the large subunit consisted of Ser(6)-Asp(146) and N-terminal of small subunit was identified as Lys(153). We successfully developed an antiserum (anti-h14D146) directed against the Asp(146) cleavage site, which reacted only with active caspase-14 but not with procaspase-14. Furthermore we confirmed that anti-h14D146 did not show any reactivity to the active forms of other caspases. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that anti-h14D146 staining was mostly restricted to the cornified layer and co-localized with some of the TUNEL positive-granular cells in the normal human epidermis. UV radiation study demonstrated that caspase-3 was activated and co-localized with TUNEL-positive cells in the middle layer of human epidermis. In contrast, we could not detect caspase-14 activation in response to UV. Our study revealed tightly regulated action of caspase-14, in which only the terminal differentiation of keratinocytes controls its activation process.

Protective effect of angiotensin II receptor blocker and calcium channel blocker on endothelial vasomotor function after everolimus-eluting stent implantation. Endothelial dysfunction after drug-eluting stent implantation has been demonstrated. It may be associated with adverse cardiovascular events during follow-up. Olmesartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, ameliorates endothelial dysfunction. The present study evaluated the protective effect of olmesartan on endothelial function after everolimus-eluting stent (EES) implantation. A total of 40 patients who underwent EES implantation were randomly assigned to the olmesartan group (20 patients with 30 lesions) or the non-olmesartan group (20 patients with 32 lesions). Endothelial function was estimated by measuring the coronary vasoreactivity in the segments 15mm proximal and distal to EES in response to intracoronary infusion of acetylcholine (Ach; 10(-8) and 10(-7)mol/L) at 9-month follow-up. Endothelium-independent vasomotion was assessed after an intracoronary bolus of isosorbide dinitrate. In both groups, Ach infusion did not induce significant vasoconstriction in the segment either proximal or distal to the EES. The changes in coronary diameter in response to 10(-8)mol/L (-2.0Â±4.4% vs. -0.6Â±4.1%, p=0.33) and 10(-7)mol/L (-1.8Â±7.9% vs. -0.3Â±7.6%, p=0.57) Ach infusion in the segment proximal to EES were not significantly different between the olmesartan group and the non-olmesartan group. There were no significant differences in vasoconstriction in response to 10(-8)mol/L (-0.8Â±5.8% vs. -0.9Â±7.0%, p=0.96) and 10(-7)mol/L (1.8Â±9.7% vs. -1.8Â±9.7%, p=0.16) Ach infusion in the segment distal to EES between the 2 groups. Endothelium-independent vasodilation after nitrate infusion did not differ between the 2 groups. Endothelial dysfunction is not observed after EES implantation. Olmesartan does not improve endothelial function after EES implantation.

Reliability and precision of pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling perfusion MRI on 3.0 T and comparison with 15O-water PET in elderly subjects at risk for Alzheimer's disease. Arterial spin labeling (ASL) offers MRI measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in vivo, and may offer clinical diagnostic utility in populations such as those with early Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the current study, we investigated the reliability and precision of a pseudo-continuous ASL (pcASL) sequence that was performed two or three times within one hour on eight young normal control subjects, and 14 elderly subjects including 11 with normal cognition, one with AD and two with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Six of these elderly subjects including one AD, two MCIs and three controls also received (15)O-water positron emission tomography (PET) scans 2 h before their pcASL MR scan. The instrumental reliability of pcASL was evaluated with the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The ICCs were greater than 0.90 in pcASL global perfusion measurements for both the young and the elderly groups. The cross-modality perfusion imaging comparison yielded very good global and regional agreement in global gray matter and the posterior cingulate cortex. Significant negative correlation was found between age and the gray/white matter perfusion ratio (r = -0.62, p < 0.002). The AD and MCI patients showed the lowest gray/white matter perfusion ratio among all the subjects. The data suggest that pcASL provides a reliable whole brain CBF measurement in young and elderly adults whose results converge with those obtained with the traditional (15)O-water PET perfusion imaging method. pcASL perfusion MRI offers an alternative method for non-invasive in vivo examination of early pathophysiological changes in AD.

Weight change during long-term treatment with lurasidone: pooled analysis of studies in patients with schizophrenia. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the effect of 12 months of treatment with lurasidone on weight in patients with schizophrenia. Post-hoc, observed-case analysis included pooled data from six studies on 40-160 mg/day lurasidone; two studies included active comparators (2-6 mg/day risperidone or 200-800 mg/day quetiapine XR). Overall, 593 patients completed 12 months of treatment (N=471 lurasidone, N = 89 risperidone, N = 33 quetiapine XR). The mean baseline weight was 72.8, 80.8, and 72.4 kg in the lurasidone, risperidone, and quetiapine XR groups, respectively. The mean weight change at month 12 was -0.4 kg with lurasidone, +2.6 kg with risperidone, and +1.2 kg with quetiapine XR. Weight gain of at least 7% from study baseline was observed in 16.0, 25.8, and 15.2% of patients, and weight loss of at least 7% was seen in 18.5, 6.7, and 9.1% of patients treated with lurasidone, risperidone, and quetiapine XR, respectively. A shift from normal/underweight baseline BMI status to overweight/obese at month 12 occurred in 10.2, 27.6, and 15.0% of patients in the lurasidone, risperidone, and quetiapine XR groups, respectively. Conversely, 14.3, 1.7, and 7.7% of patients, respectively, shifted from overweight/obese to normal/underweight. In summary, a low potential for clinically significant weight gain was observed in patients with schizophrenia treated continuously with lurasidone for 12 months.

Depletion of functionally active CD20+ T cells by rituximab treatment.

Lrp4, a novel receptor for Dickkopf 1 and sclerostin, is expressed by osteoblasts and regulates bone growth and turnover in vivo. Lrp4 is a multifunctional member of the low density lipoprotein-receptor gene family and a modulator of extracellular cell signaling pathways in development. For example, Lrp4 binds Wise, a secreted Wnt modulator and BMP antagonist. Lrp4 shares structural elements within the extracellular ligand binding domain with Lrp5 and Lrp6, two established Wnt co-receptors with important roles in osteogenesis. Sclerostin is a potent osteocyte secreted inhibitor of bone formation that directly binds Lrp5 and Lrp6 and modulates both BMP and Wnt signaling. The anti-osteogenic effect of sclerostin is thought to be mediated mainly by inhibition of Wnt signaling through Lrp5/6 within osteoblasts. Dickkopf1 (Dkk1) is another potent soluble Wnt inhibitor that binds to Lrp5 and Lrp6, can displace Lrp5-bound sclerostin and is itself regulated by BMPs. In a recent genome-wide association study of bone mineral density a significant modifier locus was detected near the SOST gene at 17q21, which encodes sclerostin. In addition, nonsynonymous SNPs in the LRP4 gene were suggestively associated with bone mineral density. Here we show that Lrp4 is expressed in bone and cultured osteoblasts and binds Dkk1 and sclerostin in vitro. MicroCT analysis of Lrp4 deficient mutant mice revealed shortened total femur length, reduced cortical femoral perimeter, and reduced total femur bone mineral content (BMC) and bone mineral density (BMD). Lumbar spine trabecular bone volume per total volume (BV/TV) was significantly reduced in the mutants and the serum and urinary bone turnover markers alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and desoxypyridinoline were increased. We conclude that Lrp4 is a novel osteoblast expressed Dkk1 and sclerostin receptor with a physiological role in the regulation of bone growth and turnover, which is likely mediated through its function as an integrator of Wnt and BMP signaling pathways.

Tissue gadolinium deposition and fibrosis mimicking nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF)-subclinical nephrogenic systemic fibrosis? Nephrogenic systemic fibrosis is a condition with significant and often debilitating cutaneous manifestations. Recent research on this disease has delineated an association between nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and exposure to magnetic resonance imaging studies using gadolinium-based contrast agents in patients with ongoing renal failure. This metal has been detected in cutaneous biopsy specimens taken from lesional skin suggesting that gadolinium provides an impetus for the deposition of circulating fibrocytes in the skin and subsequent fibrosis. We describe a hemodialysis-dependent liver transplant recipient who received a gadolinium-based contrast agent and demonstrated insoluble gadolinium deposition in a fibrotic dermis and subcutaneous septum using scanning electron microscopy/energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. He has yet to manifest symptoms and signs of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis 3 years after his magnetic resonance imaging study.

Comparing eccentric resistance exercise in prostate cancer survivors on and off hormone therapy: a pilot study. To determine the feasibility of an eccentric resistance exercise training protocol in men with prostate cancer and to assess whether men with prostate cancer who are receiving androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) have a blunted effect from the training as compared with prostate cancer survivors not receiving ADT. Prospective pilot study. Academic medical center. Sixteen men with prostate cancer (Gleason scores 3+3 to 4+4) were initially enrolled. Ten men (mean age 66, range 48-86) completed the study, 5 were currently receiving ADT. Analysis was performed on these 10 men. Subjects were evaluated at baseline. All men underwent a 12-week resistance exercise training protocol using a recumbent, high-force eccentric, leg cycle ergometer 3 times per week at a "somewhat hard" perceived exertion for 12 to 15 minutes. Preexercise and postexercise training changes were examined within and between groups. Quadriceps muscle volume (magnetic resonance imaging), isometric knee extension strength, functional mobility (Timed Up and Go Test [TUG] and 6-minute walk [6MW]), health-related quality of life (FACT-P), and fatigue (FACIT-fatigue scale). The ADT group demonstrated significant within-group improvements in the 6MW (P = .01) and isometric knee extension strength (P = .03). This group also demonstrated a clinically relevant change in the FACT-P; however, this did not meet statistical significance. The non-ADT group demonstrated significant within-group improvements in the physical subscale of the FACT-P (P = .03) and an increase in muscle volume (P = .04). Their improvements in the TUG approached significance (P = .08). No between-group differences existed. Eccentric resistance exercise was well tolerated, and both groups derived some benefits in strength and functional mobility. Men receiving ADT did not appear to have a blunted response to the exercise as compared with prostate cancer survivors not receiving ADT.

Potential for atmospheric-driven lead paint degradation in the South Coast Air Basin of California. Exposure to lead in paint or lead residues in house dust and soil is one of the leading environmental risks to the health of children in the United States. Components of photochemical smog can increase the degradation of binders in lead paint, leading to increased release of lead pigment granules to hands in surface contact or for deposition in house dust and soil. This study uses photochemical air quality modeling to map areas susceptible to increased lead paint degradation as a result of photochemical atmospheric pollutants to prioritize areas of concern. Typical air quality episodes in the South Coast Air Basin of California (SoCAB) are modeled for the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Results indicate that large areas of the SoCAB were susceptible to atmospheric-driven accelerated lead paint degradation. Inner city urban areas from central Los Angeles to Azusa and most of Orange County had the highest susceptibility to accelerated lead paint degradation, followed by inland locations near the San Bernardino Mountains. This study identifies photochemical oxidant gases as contributors to greater lead release from indoor painted surfaces in urban areas.

Novel Tn4371-ICE like element in Ralstonia pickettii and genome mining for comparative elements. Integrative Conjugative Elements (ICEs) are important factors in the plasticity of microbial genomes. An element related to the ICE Tn4371 was discovered during a bioinformatic search of the Ralstonia pickettii 12J genome. This element was analysed and further searches carried out for additional elements.A PCR method was designed to detect and characterise new elements of this type based on this scaffold and a culture collection of fifty-eight Ralstonia pickettii and Ralstonia insidiosa strains were analysed for the presence of the element. Comparative sequence analysis of bacterial genomes has revealed the presence of a number of uncharacterised Tn4371-like ICEs in the genomes of several beta and gamma- Proteobacteria. These elements vary in size, GC content, putative function and have a mosaic-like structure of plasmid- and phage-like sequences which is typical of Tn4371-like ICEs. These elements were found after a through search of the GenBank database. The elements, which are found in Ralstonia, Delftia, Acidovorax, Bordetella, Comamonas, Acidovorax, Congregibacter, Shewanella, Pseudomonas Stenotrophomonas, Thioalkalivibrio sp. HL-EbGR7, Polaromonas, Burkholderia and Diaphorobacter sp. share a common scaffold. A PCR method was designed (based on the Tn4371- like element detected in the Ralstonia pickettii 12J genome) to detect and characterise new elements of this type. All elements found in this study possess a common scaffold of core genes but contain different accessory genes. A new uniform nomenclature is suggested for ICEs of the Tn4371 family. Two novel Tn4371-like ICE were discovered and characterised, using the novel PCR method described in two different isolates of Ralstonia pickettii from laboratory purified water.

Pretransplant malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis affect cardiovascular outcomes after kidney transplantation. Malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis (MIA) syndrome is associated with a high mortality rate in patients with end-stage renal disease. However, the clinical relevance of MIA syndrome in kidney transplantation (KT) recipients remains unknown. We enrolled 1348 adult KT recipients. Recipients were assessed based on serum albumin, cholesterol, or body mass index for the malnutrition factor and C-reactive protein level for the inflammation factor. Any history of cardiovascular (CV), cerebrovascular, or peripheral vascular disease satisfied the atherosclerosis factor. Each MIA factors were assessed by univariate analysis and we calculated an overall risk score by summing up scores for each independent variable. The enrolled patients were divided into 4 groups depending on the MIA score (0, 2-4, 6, 8-10). The patients with higher MIA score showed worse outcome of fatal/non-fatal acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (p < 0.001) and composite outcomes of ACS and all-cause mortality (p < 0.001) than with the lower MIA score. In multivariate analysis, ACS showed significantly higher incidence in the MIA score 8-10 group than in the MIA score 0 group (Hazard ratio 6.12 95 % Confidence interval 1.84-20.32 p = 0.003). The presence of MIA factors before KT is an independent predictor of post-transplant CV outcomes.

Electrophysiological effects of guanosine and MK-801 in a quinolinic acid-induced seizure model. Quinolinic acid (QA) is an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor agonist that also promotes glutamate release and inhibits glutamate uptake by astrocytes. QA is used in experimental models of seizures studying the effects of overstimulation of the glutamatergic system. The guanine-based purines (GBPs), including the nucleoside guanosine, have been shown to modulate the glutamatergic system when administered extracellularly. GBPs were shown to inhibit the binding of glutamate and analogs, to be neuroprotective under excitotoxic conditions, as well as anticonvulsant against seizures induced by glutamatergic agents, including QA-induced seizure. In this work, we studied the electrophysiological effects of guanosine against QA-induced epileptiform activity in rats at the macroscopic cortical level, as inferred by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals recorded at the epidural surface. We found that QA disrupts a prominent basal theta (4-10 Hz) activity during peri-ictal periods and also promotes a relative increase in gamma (20-50 Hz) oscillations. Guanosine, when successfully preventing seizures, counteracted both these spectral changes. MK-801, an NMDA-antagonist used as positive control, was also able counteract the decrease in theta power; however, we observed an increase in the power of gamma oscillations in rats concurrently treated with MK-801 and QA. Given the distinct spectral signatures, these results suggest that guanosine and MK-801 prevent QA-induced seizures by different network mechanisms.

Very long chain fatty acid levels in patients diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. In clinical practice it is not uncommon for patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy or female carriers of adrenoleucodystrophy to have a presenting history and examination compatible with multiple sclerosis. This suggests that there may be an under-diagnosis of adrenoleucodystrophy and its variants in the multiple sclerosis population. We measured levels of very long chain fatty acids, which are typically elevated in the plasma of patients with adrenoleucodystrophy, in a large cohort of patients diagnosed clinically with multiple sclerosis. We tested serum samples from patients with either a first degree relative with multiple sclerosis or those with a primary progressive phenotype. No elevations in very long chain fatty acids were found in the cohort. This study suggests that the number of cases of adrenomyeloneuropathy or adrenoleucodystrophy amongst patients diagnosed clinically with multiple sclerosis is likely to be extremely low. This has important diagnostic implications.

Unusual case of a sigmoid mass. Endometrial carcinoma is a relatively common condition which may occur with more than 6,400 new cases diagnosed each year in the UK (Cancer Research UK Statistics http://info.cancerresearchuk.org/cancerstats/types/uterus ). It may occur following hysterectomy especially if associated with prolonged hormone replacement therapy. We report the case of a 63-year-old lady who presented with a tumour in the sigmoid mesentery 13 years after hysterectomy and following 10 years of tamoxifen therapy for a breast carcinoma. This is the first time that endometrial cancer has been reported as a complication of tamoxifen therapy in the absence of a uterus. We suggest that endometrial carcinoma remains a differential diagnosis of any pelvic or abdominal mass even after hysterectomy, and a history of intake of oestrogen agonists and antagonists needs to be obtained.

Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in pediatric patients: our 7-year experience. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax in children is a significant clinical problem. The majority of these patients will require immediate surgical therapy, such as tube thoracostomy. We conducted a retrospective review of 16 patients with a diagnosis of primary spontaneous pneumothorax over a period of 7 years. In the last 7 years, we had 16 patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. Patient age ranged from 11 to 18 years (median, 15.4). We had 12 boys and 4 girls. Pneumothorax occurred on the right side in 9 patients, on the left side in 6 patients, and on both sides in 1 patient. The first choice of treatment was tube thoracostomy. The main symptoms were chest pain, shortness of breath, and cough. In all patients, we made X-ray and computed tomography scan. In 10 children, we detected apical bullas; in 2 patients, we found giant bullas in the lower part of the lung. In 4 patients, we did not find any pathologic signs on the lung. Two patients with spontaneous pneumothorax had tube drainage without recurrence. Eleven patients were operated on with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Three patients were operated with open thoracotomy. Two of them had giant bullas, and 1 patient had recurrence after VATS. One patient had pneumothorax on both sides of the pleural cavity. VATS is an effective, safe method for spontaneous pneumothorax in children. In 11 children with pneumothorax, we made a wedge resection of the apical part of the lung with an endostapler device plus mechanical pleurodesis.

Endosulfan increases seric interleukin-2 like (IL-2L) factor and immunoglobulin M (IgM) of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) challenged with Aeromona hydrophila. Endosulfan is a persistent organochlorine insecticide which is extremely toxic to fish. It is known to induce immunological alterations in juvenile Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) such as increases in phagocytic activity and reactive oxygen species production of spleen macrophages. The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate the effects of acute exposure to a sublethal concentration of endosulfan (7 ppb, 96 h) on parameters of the adaptive humoral immune response of the aforementioned aquatic organism. The effect of endosulfan on the capacity of immune cells to produce interleukin-2 like (IL-2L) factor and immunoglobulin M (IgM) in response to a challenge with (1/2) LD50 of the infectious bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila was evaluated. Experimental results indicate that short, sublethal, endosulfan exposure triggers a succession of events beginning with non-specific activation of macrophages followed by an exacerbated synthesis of the IL-2L factor by activated B cells. This leads to significantly increased secretion of IgM and could in turn facilitate autoantibody production and the development of autoimmune pathologies.


Bacterial colonization of the dental implant fixture-abutment interface: an in vitro study.

Palonosetron in combination with 1-day versus 3-day dexamethasone for prevention of nausea and vomiting following paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with gynecologic cancers: A randomized, multicenter, phase-II trial. Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) can affect a patient's quality of life, leading to poor compliance with further treatments. Previous studies have provided minimal data about carboplatin-based regimens. Female sex is a known risk factor for CINV. The purpose of this study was to evaluate palonosetron plus single-dose dexamethasone (DEX) for preventing CINV caused by carboplatin plus paclitaxel combination therapy (TC regimen) in patients with gynecologic cancers. Patients were recruited for this phase-II, multicenter, randomized trial from 12 hospitals in Hokkaido, Japan. Eligible patients were women with uterine cervical, endometrial or ovarian cancer scheduled to receive conventional TC regimen or dose-dense TC regimen; 116 patients were randomly assigned to receive palonosetron in combination with 1-day DEX or 3-day DEX. During the overall period, complete response (CR) was observed in 67.9% (95% confidence interval, 53.7-80.1) of patients in the 3-day DEX arm, and 60.7% (95% confidence interval, 46.8-73.5) of patients in the 1-day DEX arm; CR was significantly lower in the 1-day DEX arm if motion sickness was already present (Pâ=â0.0370). In the severe hyperemesis gravidarum cohort, CR in the 1-day DEX arm tended to be lower than in the 3-day DEX arm. Combination therapy of palonosetron and 1-day DEX was effective for subjects undergoing a TC regimen for gynecologic cancers. However, the possibility of reduced efficacy of 1-day only DEX therapy in women undergoing a TC regimen could not be refuted and requires further investigation.

The Social Value of Knowledge and International Clinical Research. In light of the growth in the conduct of international clinical research in developing populations, this paper seeks to explore what is owed to developing world communities who host international clinical research. Although existing paradigms for assigning and assessing benefits to host communities offer valuable insight, I criticize their failure to distinguish between those benefits which can justify the conduct of research in a developing world setting and those which cannot. I argue that the justification for human subjects research is fundamentally grounded in the social value of knowledge, and that this value is context-dependent in a manner which should inform our ethical evaluation of the conduct of research in specific settings. I propose a new framework for the assessment of research benefits assigned to developing world host communities, a natural implication of which is to limit the types of research projects which may permissibly be conducted in developing world settings. 

An SVM-based system and its performance for detection of seizures in neonates. This work presents a multi-channel patient-independent neonatal seizure detection system based on the SVM classifier. Several post-processing steps are proposed to increase temporal precision and robustness of the system and their influence on performance is shown. The SVM-based system is evaluated on a large clinical dataset using several epoch-based and event based metrics and curves of performance are reported. Additionally, a new metric to measure the average duration of a false detection is proposed to accompany the event-based metrics.

Adherence feedback to improve asthma outcomes among inner-city children: a randomized trial. We evaluated the longitudinal effects of home-based asthma education combined with medication adherence feedback (adherence monitoring with feedback [AMF]) and asthma education alone (asthma basic care [ABC]) on asthma outcomes, relative to a usual-care (UC) control group. A total of 250 inner-city children with asthma (mean age: 7 years; 62% male; 98% black) were recruited from a pediatric emergency department (ED). Health-outcome measures included caregiver-frequency of asthma symptoms, ED visits, hospitalizations, and courses of oral corticosteroids at baseline and 6-, 12-, and 18-month assessments. Adherence measures included caregiver-reported adherence to inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy and pharmacy records of ICS refills. Multilevel modeling was used to examine the differential effects of AMF and ABC compared with UC. ED visits decreased more rapidly for the AMF group than for the UC group, but no difference was found between the ABC and UC groups. The AMF intervention led to short-term improvements in ICS adherence during the active-intervention phase relative to UC, but this improvement decreased over time. Asthma symptoms and courses of corticosteroids decreased more rapidly for the ABC group than for the UC group. Hospitalization rates did not differ between either intervention group and the UC group. No differences were found between the ABC and AMF groups on any outcome. Asthma education led to improved adherence and decreased morbidity compared with UC. Home-based educational interventions may lead to modest short-term improvements in asthma outcomes among inner-city children. Adherence feedback did not improve outcomes over education alone.

Increased adiposity in the retinol saturase-knockout mouse. The enzyme retinol saturase (RetSat) catalyzes the saturation of all-trans-retinol to produce (R)-all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol. As a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma target, RetSat was shown to be required for adipocyte differentiation in the 3T3-L1 cell culture model. To understand the mechanism involved in this putative proadipogenic effect of RetSat, we studied the consequences of ablating RetSat expression on retinoid metabolism and adipose tissue differentiation in RetSat-null mice. Here, we report that RetSat-null mice have normal levels of retinol and retinyl palmitate in liver, serum, and adipose tissue, but, in contrast to wild-type mice, are deficient in the production of all-trans-13,14-dihydroretinol from dietary vitamin A. Despite accumulating more fat, RetSat-null mice maintained on either low-fat or high-fat diets gain weight and have similar rates of food intake as age- and gender-matched wild-type control littermates. This increased adiposity of RetSat-null mice is associated with up-regulation of PPARgamma, a key transcriptional regulator of adipogenesis, and also its downstream target, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4/aP2). On the basis of these results, we propose that dihydroretinoids produced by RetSat control physiological processes that influence PPARgamma activity and regulate lipid accumulation in mice.-Moise, A.

[Women's representations and experiences with vaginal and cesarean delivery in public and private maternity hospitals]. This study analyzes the different representations and experiences of women from different social classes, including issues related to their relations with hospital staff in different institutional settings. This qualitative study focused on women who had experienced both types of delivery, in three maternity hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (one public, one fully private, and another private under an outsourcing agreement with the public health system). The study showed that variations in public and private service models result in different types of delivery care and different relations with staff, and are reflected in different birthing experiences for the women. However, a critical gender perspective shows that in both cases, the service models reproduce the medicalization of childbirth and women's submission as objects in the birthing process. Although this is manifested in different ways in the three groups, the end result is to reduce the range of care and the possibility of women's empowerment during childbirth.

Comparison of early and late efficacy of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty with or without subsequent brachytherapy: the effect on blood pressure in patients with renovascular hypertension. Scarce data exist concerning the long-term effect of percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty (PTRA) enhanced with intravascular gamma brachytherapy (IVBT) in patients with renovascular hypertension. Seventy one patients aged 52 +/- 8 years with refractory renovascular hypertension were randomized to Group I (PTRA + IVBT) or Group II (PTRA). For the IVBT procedure, the PARIS catheter and Microselectron HDR (Nucletron) system was employed. Both baseline and 9-month follow-up quantitative computerized angiography (QCA) and ambulatory blood pressure monitoring analysis was performed to assess luminal parameters of restenosis and the effect of treatment on blood pressure. Thirty three patients from Group I and 29 patients from Group II underwent successful procedure. During nine months of follow-up, three patients died; including two patients in Group I (cardiac causes) and one patient in Group II (stroke). The follow-up lumen diameter stenosis was 30.6 +/- 13.7% and 40.4 +/- 11% in Groups I and II, respectively (p = 0.004). Late lumen loss in quantitative computerized angiography was 1.2 +/- 0.7 mm and 1.7 +/- 0.7 mm in Groups I and II, respectively (p = 0.004). Intravascular gamma brachytherapy using self-centering source performed after balloon angioplasty is a safe and effective method of prevention of restenosis after PTRA in patients with renovascular hypertension.

Water spray cooling during handling of feedlot cattle. Activities involved in receiving or working (e.g., sorting, dehorning, castration, weighing, implanting, etc.) of feedlot cattle cause an increase in body temperature. During hot weather the increased body temperature may disrupt normal behaviors including eating, which can be especially detrimental to the well-being and performance of the animals. Sprinkle cooling of animals has been successfully employed within the pen; however, added moisture to the pens' surface increases odor generation from the pen. A study was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of a single instance of wetting an animal within the working facility instead of in the pen, which could potentially provide extra evaporative cooling to offset the added heat produced by activity. Sixty-four cross-bred heifers were assigned to one of eight pens on the basis of weight. On four separate occasions during hot conditions (average temperature 28.2âÂ±â1.9Â°C, 29.1âÂ±â2.0Â°C, 28.9âÂ±â3.0Â°C, and 26.8âÂ±â1.6Â°C; with the temperature ranging from 22.6 to 32.5Â°C during the trials), the heifers were moved from their pens to and from the working facility (a building with a scale and squeeze chute located 160-200Â m away). While in the squeeze chute, four of the pens of heifers were sprinkle cooled and the remaining four pens were worked as normal. The heifers that were treated had a body temperature that peaked sooner (31.9âÂ±â0.63Â min compared to 37.6âÂ±â0.62) with a lower peak body temperature (39.55âÂ±â0.03Â°C compared to 39.74âÂ±â0.03Â°C), and recovered sooner (70.5âÂ±â2.4Â min compared to 83.2âÂ±â2.4Â min). The treated animals also had a lower panting score, a visual assessment of level of cattle heat stress (1.1âÂ±â0.2 compared to 1.16âÂ±â0.2). The behavior measurements that were taken did not indicate a change in behavior. It was concluded that while a single instance of wetting an animal within the working facility did not completely offset the increase in body temperature, it was beneficial to the animals without needing to add water to the pen surface, thus reducing the potential for odor generation.

Regulation of interleukin-6 expression in osteoblasts by oxidized phospholipids. Epidemiological evidence suggests that cardiovascular disease is associated with osteoporosis, independent of age. Bone resorptive surface is increased in mice on a high-fat diet, and osteoclastic differentiation of bone marrow preosteoclasts is promoted by oxidized phospholipids. Because osteoclastic differentiation requires cytokines produced by osteoblasts, we hypothesized that the stimulatory mechanism of oxidized phospholipids is via induction of osteoclast-regulating cytokines in osteoblasts. To investigate the effects of oxidized phospholipids on expression of such cytokines, murine calvarial preosteoblasts, MC3T3-E1, were treated with oxidized 1-palmitoyl-2-arachidonyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ox-PAPC), an active component of oxidized lipoproteins. Results showed that ox-PAPC increased expression of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. IL-6 expression was also elevated in calvarial tissues from hyperlipidemic but not in wild-type mice. Ox-PAPC also induced IL-6 protein levels in both MC3T3-E1 and primary calvarial cells. Promoter-reporter assay analysis showed that ox-PAPC, but not PAPC, induced murine IL-6 promoter activity. Effects of ox-PAPC on IL-6 expression and the promoter activity were attenuated by H89, a PKA inhibitor. Analysis of deletion and mutant IL-6 promoter constructs suggested that CAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) partly mediates the ox-PAPC effects. Taken together, the data suggest that oxidized phospholipids induce IL-6 expression in osteoblasts in part via C/EBP.

ATM augments nuclear stabilization of DYRK2 by inhibiting MDM2 in the apoptotic response to DNA damage. The tumor suppressor p53 is a transcription factor that regulates cell cycle, DNA repair, senescence, and apoptosis in response to DNA damage. Phosphorylation of p53 at Ser-46 is indispensable for the commitment to apoptotic cell death. A previous study has shown that upon exposure to genotoxic stress, DYRK2 translocates into the nucleus and phosphorylates p53 at Ser-46, thereby inducing apoptosis. However, less is known about mechanisms responsible for intracellular control of DYRK2. Here we show the functional nuclear localization signal at N-terminal domain of DYRK2. Under normal conditions, nuclear and not cytoplasmic DYRK2 is ubiquitinated by MDM2, resulting in its constitutive degradation. In the presence of proteasome inhibitors, we detected a stable complex of DYRK2 with MDM2 at the nucleus. Upon exposure to genotoxic stress, ATM phosphorylates DYRK2 at Thr-33 and Ser-369, which enables DYRK2 to escape from degradation by dissociation from MDM2 and to induce the kinase activity toward p53 at Ser-46 in the nucleus. These findings indicate that ATM controls stability and pro-apoptotic function of DYRK2 in response to DNA damage.

Comprehensive analysis of hepatic gene and protein expression profiles on phenobarbital- or clofibrate-induced hepatic hypertrophy in dogs. In order to characterize the hepatic effects of phenobarbital (PB) and clofibrate (CPIB) in dogs, PB and CPIB were administered to male beagle dogs for 14 days, and biochemical and histopathological examinations and comprehensive genomic and proteomic analyses, including GeneChip analysis and proteomics analysis using the 2-dimension difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) technique, were performed. Both compounds caused centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy, which were related to smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) proliferation in PB-treated dogs and to mitochondrial proliferation in CPIB-treated dogs. In the PB-treated dogs, drug-metabolizing enzyme induction was observed by Western blot and genomic analyses. CYP proteins could not be detected by the 2D-DIGE analysis, but increases in several endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-related proteins were observed. In the CPIB-treated dogs, drug-metabolizing enzyme induction was not clearly observed by any of Western blot, genomic and proteomic analyses. Genomic and proteomic analyses revealed that mitochondrial genes and proteins, including carnitine palmytoiltransferase II, acyl-CoA deheydrogenase and hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, pyruvate carboxylase and ATP synthase beta chain were induced. There is a relatively good correlation among the morphology and the genomic and proteomic data, but some differences exist between the genomic and proteomic data. Comprehensive evaluation using these techniques in addition to morphological evaluation may provide a useful tool for safety assessment of the liver.

Biomarkers as tools for improved diagnostic and therapeutic monitoring in systemic lupus erythematosis. One of the major challenges in rheumatology is to overcome the classification criteria that previously defined systemic lupus erythematosis, since the heterogeneity of the disease(s) appears to represent a complexity that probably substantially contributed to the failure of a number of recent trials. For those engaged in clinical trials, validated disease activity biomarkers that respond rapidly to treatment and are predictive of clinical response would greatly facilitate early decision-making around futility and dose selection. Likewise, use of validated patient stratification biomarkers possibly in conjunction with autoantibody profiles and disease manifestations will result in the recruitment of more homogeneous patient populations during later stage clinical studies, thereby decreasing size, costs, and risks in pivotal studies.

Expression of galectin-1 in immune cells and glial cells after spinal cord injury. Galectin-1, a member of a family of beta-galactoside-binding proteins, is differentially expressed by various tissues and performs a wide range of biological functions. Galectin-1 has been shown to mediate inflammation and to be involved in axonal regeneration in the oxidized form and in axonal degeneration in the reduced form; however, its involvement in injury and the repair processes after spinal cord injury have not been studied. Therefore, we studied galectin-1 expression in injured spinal cords. Immunostaining analysis of galectin-1 in injured spinal cords revealed that galectin-1-expressing cells assembled around the lesion site. Galectin-1 was intensively expressed by neutrophils 1 day, by microglia/macrophages 3 days, and by astrocytes 7 days after spinal cord injury. These results suggest that galectin-1 may be associated with the pathogenesis of spinal cord injury.

The change of gait parameters during walking at different percentage of preferred walking speed for healthy adults aged 20-60 years. This study aims to investigate the effects of age, gender and walking speed on the gait performance during walking at a range of percentage of preferred walking speed (PPWS). The subjects were aged from 20 to 60 years and both genders were equally represented. A nested-factorial analysis of variance was employed. The independent variables include walking speed (80%, 100%, 120%, and 140% PPWS), age (young, middle, and older groups) and gender. The response measures include lower limb joint motion, vertical ground reaction force (VGRF), muscle electromyography (EMG), heart rate, and perceived exertion of whole body and local areas. The results show that different age and gender groups had similar gait performance on most of the joint motions, HR, as well as the perceived exertions while walking at a range of PPWS. In addition, these performance generally increased with the increasing walking speed and the trend becomes more obvious when the speed was higher than 120% PWS. Age and gender differences have been found in VGRFs and muscle EMG. Females exhibited significantly higher VGRF in the heel-strike and toe-off stages, as well as higher tibialis anterior muscle activity. Older subjects had significantly higher rectus femoris muscle activity than younger adults. Besides, the interaction between gender and walking speed was significant on VGRF in the toe-off stage. Further discussions are addressed.

Uromodulin levels associate with a common UMOD variant and risk for incident CKD. Common variants in the region of the UMOD gene, which encodes uromodulin (Tamm-Horsfall protein), associate with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and estimated GFR (eGFR). Whether uromodulin levels associate with UMOD variants or with the risk for developing CKD is unknown. We conducted an age- and gender-matched case-control study (n = 200) of incident CKD (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) within the Framingham Heart Study (FHS). Baseline urinary uromodulin concentrations were related to case-control status 9.9 yr later and to genotype at rs4293393. As a replication set, we tested the genotype association with uromodulin concentration in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (n = 42). Geometric means of uromodulin concentrations were 51% higher in case than in control subjects (P = 0.016). The adjusted odds ratio of CKD per 1-SD higher concentration of uromodulin was 1.72 (95% confidence interval 1.07 to 2.77; P = 0.03) after accounting for CKD risk factors and baseline eGFR. We observed lower urinary uromodulin concentrations per each copy of the C allele at rs4293393 in both cohorts. In summary, elevated uromodulin concentrations precede the onset of CKD and associate with a common polymorphism in the UMOD region.

Role of AKT kinase in measles virus replication. Many RNA and DNA viruses activate serine-threonine kinase AKT to increase virus replication. In contrast, measles virus (MV) infection leads to downregulation of AKT. This is thought to be beneficial for the virus because it correlates with immune suppression. To determine whether this is a sacrifice for the virus, we used a recombinant virus and transfected cells expressing constitutively active AKT and evaluated its effect on virus replication. In vitro, overexpression of AKT did not influence virus replication but did affect (cell-type dependent) virus release. In vivo, the recombinant virus did not abrogate inhibition of proliferation of spleen cells from MV-infected cotton rats.


Novel Antioxidant Tripeptide "ACQ" Can Prevent UV-Induced Cell Death and Preserve the Number of Epidermal Stem Cells.

Influence of Steric Crowding on Diastereoselective Arabinofuranosylations. The occurrence of arabinofuranosides on the cell surface of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) and their significance in controlling disease spurred interest in developing strategies for their diastereoselective synthesis. Mtb uses enzymes to achieve diastereoselectivity through noncovalent interactions. Of the two possible glycosidic linkages, chemically, 1,2-trans linkage is relatively easy to synthesize by taking advantage of neighboring group participation, whereas synthesis of the 1,2-cis linkage is notoriously difficult. In this article, stereochemical effects on the diastereoselectivity of arabinofuranosidation are investigated with thiopyridyl, imidate, and thiotolyl donors as well as differently crowded glycosyl acceptors; subtle differences in the stereochemical environment of the acceptors were observed to alter the diastereoselectivity of the furanoside formation. Results from this endeavor suggest that 1,2-cis arabinofuranosides can be synthesized conveniently by conducting the reaction at lower temperature on sterically demanding and less reactive substrates.

The influence of circumferential resection margins on long-term outcomes following rectal cancer surgery. Circumferential resection margin involvement after rectal cancer surgery is associated with local recurrence and decreased survival, but definitions of "safe" margins vary. This study assessed the influence of various circumferential margins on long-term outcome from rectal cancer surgery. Data were extracted from a rectal cancer database of patients undergoing rectal resection at a tertiary referral center between 1971 and 1996. The influence of circumferential margins on five-year local recurrence and cancer-specific survival were assessed using Cox regression. Circumferential margin measurements were available from 435 patients (median follow-up, 70.4 months). Cancer-specific survival at five years was 80.8%, 69.2%, 59.2%, and 34.1% for tumors with a circumferential resection margin of >10 mm, 3-10 mm, 2 mm, and < or =1mm, respectively (P < 0.001). Local recurrence at five years was 9.0%, 14.7%, and 25.8% for margins >10 mm, 2-10 mm, and < or =1 mm, respectively (P = 0.001). Independent predictors of cancer-specific mortality were circumferential margins of < or =1 mm vs. >10 mm (odds ratio = 3.38, P = 0.014) or 2 mm (odds ratio = 2.24, P = 0.029), Dukes Stage (C2 vs. A: odds ratio = 15.18, P < 0.001), and vascular invasion (present vs. absent: odds ratio = 1.51, P = 0.033). Local recurrence was predicted by a margin of < or =1 mm (odds ratio = 2.29, P = 0.041), gender (female vs. male: odds ratio = 0.25, P = 0.002), Dukes Stage (C2 vs. A: odds ratio = 28.89, P = 0.003), and vascular invasion (extramural vs. none: odds ratio = 2.04, P = 0.024). Circumferential margins < or =2 mm are associated with significantly reduced cancer-specific survival, and margins < or =1 mm with increased local recurrence, when other factors are accounted for, challenging the assumption that a circumferential resection margin of < or =1 mm is safe.

Contributions of the pre- and pro-regions of a Staphylococcus hyicus lipase to secretion of a heterologous protein by Bacillus subtilis. Bacillus subtilis is a well-established cell factory for efficient secretion of many biotechnologically relevant enzymes that are naturally produced by it or related organisms. However, the use of B. subtilis as a host for production of heterologous secretory proteins can be complicated by problems related to inefficient translocation of the foreign proteins across the plasma membrane or to inefficient release of the exported proteins from the cell surface into the surrounding medium. Therefore, there is a clear need for tools that allow more efficient membrane targeting, translocation, and release during the production of these proteins. In the present study, we investigated the contributions of the pre (pre(lip)) and pro (pro(lip)) sequences of a Staphylococcus hyicus lipase to secretion of a heterologous protein, the alkaline phosphatase PhoA of Escherichia coli, by B. subtilis. The results indicate that the presence of the pro(lip)-peptide, in combination with the lipase signal peptide (pre(lip)), contributes significantly to the efficient secretion of PhoA by B. subtilis and that pre(lip) directs PhoA secretion more efficiently than the authentic signal peptide of PhoA. Genome-wide transcriptional analyses of the host cell responses indicate that, under the conditions tested, no known secretion or membrane-cell wall stress responses were provoked by the production of PhoA with any of the pre- and pro-region sequences used. Our data underscore the view that the pre-pro signals of the S. hyicus lipase are very useful tools for secretion of heterologous proteins in B. subtilis.

Electroporation-mediated delivery of a naked DNA plasmid expressing VEGF to the porcine heart enhances protein expression. Gene therapy is an attractive method for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. However, using current strategies, induction of gene expression at therapeutic levels is often inefficient. In this study, we show a novel electroporation (EP) method to enhance the delivery of a plasmid expressing an angiogenic growth factor (vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF), which is a molecule previously documented to stimulate revascularization in coronary artery disease. DNA expression plasmids were delivered in vivo to the porcine heart with or without coadministered EP to determine the potential effect of electrically mediated delivery. The results showed that plasmid delivery through EP significantly increased cardiac expression of VEGF compared with injection of plasmid alone. This is the first report showing successful intracardiac delivery, through in vivo EP, of a protein expressing plasmid in a large animal.


Bidirectional correlation of NMR and capillary electrophoresis fingerprints: a new approach to investigating Schistosoma mansoni infection in a mouse model.

Conditional deletion of neuronal cyclin-dependent kinase 5 in developing forebrain results in microglial activation and neurodegeneration. Neuronal migration disorders are often identified in patients with epilepsy refractory to medical treatment. The prolonged or repeated seizures are known to cause neuronal death; however, the mechanism underlying seizure-induced neuronal death remains to be elucidated. An essential role of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) in brain development has been demonstrated in Cdk5(-/-) mice, which show neuronal migration defects and perinatal lethality. Here, we show the consequences of Cdk5 deficiency in the postnatal brain by generating Cdk5 conditional knockout mice, in which Cdk5is selectively eliminated from neurons in the developing forebrain. The conditional mutant mice were viable, but exhibited complex neurological deficits including seizures, tremors, and growth retardation. The forebrain not only showed disruption of layering, but also neurodegenerative changes accompanied by neuronal loss and microglial activation. The neurodegenerative changes progressed with age and were accompanied by up-regulation of the neuronal tissue-type plasminogen activator, a serine protease known to mediate microglial activation. Thus age-dependent neurodegeneration in the Cdk5 conditional knockout mouse brain invoked a massive inflammatory reaction. These findings indicate an important role of Cdk5 in inflammation, and also provide a mouse model to examine the possible involvement of inflammation in the pathogenesis of progressive cognitive decline in patients with neuronal migration disorders.

Effects of weather on the performance of marathon runners. The effects of air temperature, relative and specific humidity, wind speed, solar shortwave radiation, thermal longwave radiation, and rain on the performance of participants in the annual Stockholm Marathon from 1980 to 2008 were analysed statistically. The objective was to validate and extend previous studies by including data on finishing times of slower male and female runners and on the percentage of non-finishers. Due to decadal trends in the finishing time not related to weather, the finishing time anomaly (FTA) was calculated as the deviation of the annual finishing time from the linear trend of the finishing time. In all categories of runners, the single weather parameter with highest correlation with the FTA was the air temperature (correlation coefficient r = 0.66-0.73, with the highest values for slowest runners). Also, the solar shortwave radiation (r = 0.41-0.71), air relative humidity (r = -0.57 to -0.44) and, for male runners, the occurrence of rain (r = -0.51 to -0.42) reached a statistically significant correlation with the FTA, but the effects of the relative humidity and rain only arose from their negative correlation with the air temperature. The percentage of non-finishers (PNF) was significantly affected by the air temperature and specific humidity (r = 0.72 for multiple regression), which is a new result. Compared to faster runners, the results of slower runners were more affected by unfavourable weather conditions; this was previously known for runners with finishing times of 2.1-3 h, and now extended to finishing times of 4.7 h. Effects of warm weather were less evident for female than male runners, which was probably partly due to female runners' larger ratio of surface area to body mass and slower running speed.

The mitogenic effectors of isoproterenol in human hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Increasing data indicate that stress hormones and their corresponding receptors play an important role in the carcinogenesis and progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, there is presently no study investigating the influence of stress hormones in correlation with beta2-AR on human HCC cells. We examined the expression of alpha1- and beta-ARs in human HCC cell line HepG2 and MHCC97H cells in comparison with that in human normal hepatic cell line HL-7702 cells (L-02), and the influence of isoproterenol (ISO) on the growth of these HCC cells using blocking agents in correlation with beta2-AR and its downstream signaling pathways. We found that alpha1-AR was down-regulated and beta2-AR was up-regulated in HepG2 and MHCC97H cells. ISO dose-dependently promoted the growth of both HepG2 and MHCC97H cells. ISO-induced growth and survival of HCC cells were effectively attenuated by ICI 118551, U0126 and PD153035, but not by H-89 or LY294002. ISO transiently activated MAPK/ERK1/2 in tumor cells which could be blocked either by ICI 118551 or U0126, but not by H-89, LY294002, or PD153035. These findings indicate that ISO mimicking a mitogen promoted the growth of HepG2 and MHCC97H cells via beta2-AR-mediated activation of both MAPK/ERK1/2 dependent and independent signaling pathways, and ISO activated MAPK/ERK1/2 by an EGFR-independent mechanism.


Total ganglioside ablation at mouse motor nerve terminals alters neurotransmitter release level.

miR-221&222 regulate TRAIL resistance and enhance tumorigenicity through PTEN and TIMP3 downregulation. Lung and liver cancers are among the most deadly types of cancer. Despite improvements in treatment over the past few decades, patient survival remains poor, underlining the need for development of targeted therapies. MicroRNAs represent a class of small RNAs frequently deregulated in human malignancies. We now report that miR-221&222 are overexpressed in aggressive non-small cell lung cancer and hepatocarcinoma cells, as compared with less invasive and/or normal lung and liver cells. We show that miR-221&222, by targeting PTEN and TIMP3 tumor suppressors, induce TRAIL resistance and enhance cellular migration through the activation of the AKT pathway and metallopeptidases. Finally, we demonstrate that the MET oncogene is involved in miR-221&222 activation through the c-Jun transcription factor.

Reduction of radiation delivered to patients undergoing invasive coronary procedures. Effect of a programme for dose reduction based on radiation-protection training. Exposure of patients to radiation from invasive cardiac procedures is high and may be deleterious. To assess the effectiveness of a dose-reduction programme based on radiation-protection training, according to the recommendations of the Euratom Council, the International Commission on Radiological Protection and the French Society of Cardiology. In this single-centre survey, dose-area product (DAP, Gy.cm(2)), fluoroscopy time (minutes) and number of runs were evaluated in 3285 consecutive procedures (2077 coronary angiographies [CAs], 1208 percutaneous coronary interventions [PCIs]), performed one year before (2005) and two years after (2006 to 2007) implementation of a programme for radiation dose-reduction. The programme included a 2-day training course in radiological protection for all medical and paramedical staff and recommendations for routine use of low fluoroscopic and acquisition pulse rates (6.25 and 12.5 i/s, respectively), large field size (23cm), maximal collimation and optimal X-ray tube/patient/detector distances. Routine left ventriculography was discouraged. The radial approach was used in>80% of the procedures. Compared with 2005, a significant 50% reduction in DAP was observed in 2006 and 2007 during CA (median [interquartile range] 53 Gy.cm(2) [33-84] vs 26 [16-43] and 21 [14-32], respectively; p<0.0001) and PCI (125 Gy.cm(2) [78-184] vs 49 [31-79] and 44 [27-66], respectively; p<0.0001). Fluoroscopy time and number of runs did not vary significantly in 2006, and decreased slightly in 2007, likely due to an important reduction in rate of left ventriculographies (from 32 to 4%). Inter-operator variability in DAP was reduced. Training in radiation protection for interventional cardiologists and use of simple and cost-free dose-reduction techniques were associated with a 50% reduction in radiation exposure to patients undergoing invasive cardiac procedures, without any loss of diagnostic information.

Your mind's hand: motor imagery of pointing movements with different accuracy.

Multi-scale recordings for neuroprosthetic control of finger movements. We trained a rhesus monkey to perform individuated and combined finger flexions and extensions of the thumb, index, and middle finger. A Utah Electrode Array (UEA) was implanted into the hand region of the motor cortex contralateral to the monkey's trained hand. We also implanted a microwire electrocorticography grid (microECoG) epidurally so that it covered the UEA. The microECoG grid spanned the arm and hand regions of both the primary motor and somatosensory cortices. Previously this monkey had Implantable MyoElectric Sensors (IMES) surgically implanted into the finger muscles of the monkey's forearm. Action potentials (APs), local field potentials (LFPs), and microECoG signals were recorded from wired head-stage connectors for the UEA and microECoG grids, while EMG was recorded wirelessly. The monkey performed a finger flexion/extension task while neural and EMG data were acquired. We wrote an algorithm that uses the spike data from the UEA to perform a real-time decode of the monkey's finger movements. Also, analyses of the LFP and microECoG data indicate that these data show trial-averaged differences between different finger movements, indicating the data are potentially decodeable.

Model-based approach for tracking embryogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans fluorescence microscopy data. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) is a widely used model organism in biological investigations. Due to its well-known and invariant cell lineage tree, it can be used to study the effects of mutations and various disease processes. Effective and efficient analysis of the wealth of time-lapse fluorescence microscopy image data acquired in such studies requires automation of the cell segmentation and tracking tasks involved. This is hampered by many factors, including autofluorescence effects, low and uneven contrast throughout the images, high noise levels, large numbers of possibly simultaneous cell divisions, and touching or clustering cells. In this paper, we present a new algorithm for segmentation and tracking of cells in C. elegans embryogenesis image data. It is based on the model evolution framework for image segmentation and uses a novel multi-object tracking scheme based on energy minimization via graph cuts. Preliminary experiments on publicly available test data demonstrate the potential of the algorithm compared to existing approaches.


MR imaging findings of iron overload.

Mechanomyogram for identifying muscle activity and fatigue. Mechanomyogram is the recording of the acoustic activity associated with the muscle contraction. While discovered nearly a decade ago with the intention of providing an alternate to the surface electromyogram, it has not yet been investigated thoroughly and there are no current applications associated with MMG. This paper reports an experimental study of MMG against force of contraction and muscle fatigue during cyclic contraction. The results indicate that there is a relationship between the intensity of the MMG recording and force of contraction. A change in the intensity of MMG is also observed with the onset of muscle fatigue. However, the inter-subject variation is very large. The results also indicate that the spectrum of the MMG is very inconsistent and not a useful feature of the signal.

The overgrowth of Listeria monocytogenes by other Listeria spp. in food samples undergoing enrichment cultivation has a nutritional basis. The isolation of Listeria monocytogenes from food is carried out using a double enrichment. In cases where multiple Listeria species are present within the original sample, L. monocytogenes can be overgrown during enrichment by other species of listeria present in the original sample. From a practical perspective, this can result in a false negative or complicate the ability of public health investigators to match food and clinical isolates. We have further investigated this phenomenon by analysing the growth kinetics of single species and pairs of different species over the ISO 11290-1 enrichment process. The overgrowth of a strain of L. monocytogenes by a strain of Listeria innocua resulted primarily from interactions which occurred in late exponential phase, where it was observed that growth of both strains stopped when the dominant strain reached stationary phase. In a second mixed culture, the dominant L. monocytogenes strain suppressed the exponential growth rate of the second Listeria welshimeri strain. Both findings suggest that the overgrowth could partially be explained in terms of a nutritional competition. Multi-factor analysis of Fraser broth constituents and growth temperatures using both stressed and non-stressed inoculants failed to identify any single factor in the ISO 11290-1 methodology which would contribute to the overgrowth phenomenon in our model system. Furthermore, species was not a significant factor in observed differences in growth parameters among a wider array of strains which had been stressed or not stressed prior to grown in Fraser broths, even though some strains had significantly faster growth rates than others. Limiting diffusion in Fraser broth through the addition of agar significantly reduced the extent of the overgrowth in experiments using mixtures of strains originally isolated from foods where overgrowth had been previously observed. Taken together, these findings support that the overgrowth phenomenon in most instances has a nutritional basis.


Is there a relationship between body mass index and serum vitamin D levels?

A mechanistic niche model for measuring species' distributional responses to seasonal temperature gradients. Niche theory is central to understanding how species respond geographically to climate change. It defines a species' realized niche in a biological community, its fundamental niche as determined by physiology, and its potential niche--the fundamental niche in a given environment or geographic space. However, most predictions of the effects of climate change on species' distributions are limited to correlative models of the realized niche, which assume that species are in distributional equilibrium with respect to the variables or gradients included in the model. Here, I present a mechanistic niche model that measures species' responses to major seasonal temperature gradients that interact with the physiology of the organism. I then use lethal physiological temperatures to parameterize the model for bird species in North and South America and show that most focal bird species are not in direct physiological equilibrium with the gradients. Results also show that most focal bird species possess broad thermal tolerances encompassing novel climates that could become available with climate change. I conclude with discussion of how mechanistic niche models may be used to (i) gain insights into the processes that cause species to respond to climate change and (ii) build more accurate correlative distribution models in birds and other species.

Plant polycistronic precursors containing non-homologous microRNAs target transcripts encoding functionally related proteins. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous single-stranded small RNAs that regulate the expression of specific mRNAs involved in diverse biological processes. In plants, miRNAs are generally encoded as a single species in independent transcriptional units, referred to as MIRNA genes, in contrast to animal miRNAs, which are frequently clustered. We performed a comparative genomic analysis in three model plants (rice, poplar and Arabidopsis) and characterized miRNA clusters containing two to eight miRNA species. These clusters usually encode miRNAs of the same family and certain share a common evolutionary origin across monocot and dicot lineages. In addition, we identified miRNA clusters harboring miRNAs with unrelated sequences that are usually not evolutionarily conserved. Strikingly, non-homologous miRNAs from the same cluster were predicted to target transcripts encoding related proteins. At least four Arabidopsis non-homologous clusters were expressed as single transcriptional units. Overexpression of one of these polycistronic precursors, producing Ath-miR859 and Ath-miR774, led to the DCL1-dependent accumulation of both miRNAs and down-regulation of their different mRNA targets encoding F-box proteins. In addition to polycistronic precursors carrying related miRNAs, plants also contain precursors allowing coordinated expression of non-homologous miRNAs to co-regulate functionally related target transcripts. This mechanism paves the way for using polycistronic MIRNA precursors as a new molecular tool for plant biologists to simultaneously control the expression of different genes.

Dexamethasone attenuates the embryotoxic effect of endometriotic peritoneal fluid in a murine model. The in vitro fertilization (IVF) pregnancy rate of women with advanced stage endometriosis is nearly half that of the general population, suggesting incomplete targeting of the pathophysiology underlying endometriosis-associated infertility. Compelling evidence highlights inflammation as the etiologic link between endometriosis and infertility and a potential target for adjunctive treatment. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of dexamethasone on murine embryos exposed to human endometriotic peritoneal fluid (PF) using the established murine embryo assay model. PF was obtained from women with and without severe endometriosis. Murine embryos were harvested and randomly allocated to five groups of culture media conditions: (1) human tubal fluid (HTF), (2) HTF and 10Â % PF from women without endometriosis, (3) HTF and 10Â % PF from women with endometriosis (PF-E), (4) HTF with PF-E and 0.01Â mcg/mL dexamethasone, and (5) HTF with PF-E and 0.1Â mcg/mL dexamethasone. Embryos were cultured in standard conditions and evaluated for blastocyst development. A total of 266 mouse embryos were cultured. Baseline blastulation rates were 63.6Â %. The addition of peritoneal fluid from women with endometriosis decreased the blastocyst development rate to 38.9Â % (Pâ=â0.008). The addition of 0.1Â mcg/mL of dexamethasone to the culture media restored the blastulation rate to near baseline levels (61.2Â %; Pâ=â0.019). The results of our in vitro study demonstrate the capacity of dexamethasone to mitigate the deleterious impact of endometriotic PF on embryo development. If confirmed in vivo, dexamethasone may prove a useful adjunct for the treatment of endometriosis-associated infertility.

The progressive increase of food waste in America and its environmental impact. Food waste contributes to excess consumption of freshwater and fossil fuels which, along with methane and CO(2) emissions from decomposing food, impacts global climate change. Here, we calculate the energy content of nationwide food waste from the difference between the US food supply and the food consumed by the population. The latter was estimated using a validated mathematical model of metabolism relating body weight to the amount of food eaten. We found that US per capita food waste has progressively increased by approximately 50% since 1974 reaching more than 1400 kcal per person per day or 150 trillion kcal per year. Food waste now accounts for more than one quarter of the total freshwater consumption and approximately 300 million barrels of oil per year.


Secondary osteoporosis in patients with an osteoporotic fracture.

Preventive effect of artificial ligamentous stabilization on the upper adjacent segment impairment following posterior lumbar interbody fusion. A retrospective, comparative study. To assess the effects of soft stabilization with artificial ligamentous bands placed on the upper segment adjacent to posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) for prevention of transition syndrome compared with patients who underwent PLIF without soft stabilization. Spine fusion increases mechanical stress and can cause other spinal problems adjacent to the fusion level. Soft stabilization using artificial ligamentous bands has been reported to decrease the flexion instability and this iatrogenic problems. There is no report concerning the effect of soft stabilization to transition syndrome following PLIF. In 225 patients undergoing L4/5 PLIF, 70 consecutive patients who were treated concomitantly with decompression of L3/4 with minimum 2-year follow-up were included. Thirty-five patients underwent soft stabilization of L3/4 (soft stabilization [S] group) with natural neutral concept rods, and 35 patients did not (decompression [D] group). Radiographic changes in the disc height, vertebral slip, intervertebral angle, range of motion, lumbar lordosis, and L3 tilt angle were measured. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), postoperative progression of the disc degeneration and spinal canal stenosis were evaluated. RESULTS.: In the S group, significant posterior intervertebral expansion on radiograph was less advanced at the final follow-up (P < 0.005). MRI images demonstrated less significant aggravation of disc degeneration (P < 0.001) and progression of adjacent stenosis (P < 0.01), at L3/4 in the S group. Adjacent intervertebral changes on MRI occurred relatively early after surgery, suggesting that changes were due to transition syndrome, but not age-related changes. These results demonstrated an effect of soft stabilization for the prevention of transition syndrome in lumbar spine fusion. Although the postoperative follow-up periods in this study were not sufficiently long to reach a definitive conclusion, intervertebral breakdown adjacent to the rigid spine fusion could be diminished by the application of soft stabilization.

[Chronic heart failure and cachexia: role of endocrine system]. Chronic heart failure (CHF) is a major health problem that carries a devastating prognosis. The prognosis worsens considerably once cardiac cachexia has been diagnosed. Neurohormonal, metabolic, hemodynamic and immunological alterations are involved in the initiation and progression of cardiac cachexia. Cachexia is characterized by a hypothalamic inappropriate response to the mechanisms controlling energy homeostasis. Levels of the anorexigenic hormone leptin are decreased whereas the orexigenic gherlin hormone levels are normal or elevated. Nevertheless, energy intake is not increased as expected due to a persistent activation of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC) system (anorexigenic) paralleled by a decreased activity of the neuropeptide Y (NPY, orexigenic) neurons. Cachexia is also characterized by an imbalance in anabolic (impairment in the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-I axis, insulin resistance) and catabolic (increased levels of catecholamines, increased cortisol/dehydroepiandrosterone ratio and activation of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleuchin-6, interleuchin-1') at the basis of the wasting process. This review discusses the complex role of the endocrine system in modulating energy balance, appetite and metabolism in patients with chronic heart failure. A joint multidisciplinary effort of the cardiologists, immunologists and endocrinologists might be useful to identify the precise mechanisms involved in the neuroendocrine alteration and to develop therapeutic strategies able to improve the prognosis of CHF patients.

Mitochondria, bioenergetics, and the epigenome in eukaryotic and human evolution. Studies on the origin of species have focused largely on anatomy, yet animal populations are generally limited by energy. Animals can adapt to available energy resources at three levels: (1) evolution of different anatomical forms between groups of animals through nuclear DNA (nDNA) mutations, permitting exploitation of alternative energy reservoirs and resulting in new species with novel niches, (2) evolution of different physiologies within intraspecific populations through mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and nDNA bioenergetic genes, permitting adjustment to energetic variation within a species' niche, and (3) epigenomic regulation of dispersed bioenergetic genes within an individual via mitochondrially generated high-energy intermediates, permitting individual adjustment to environmental fluctuations. Because medicine focuses on changes within our species, clinically relevant variation is more likely to involve changes in bioenergetics than anatomy. This may explain why mitochondrial diseases and epigenomic diseases frequently have similar phenotypes and why epigenomic diseases are being found to involve mitochondrial dysfunction. Therefore, common complex diseases may be the result of changes in any of a large number of mtDNA and nDNA bioenergetic genes or to altered epigenomic regulation of these bioenergetic genes. All of these changes result in similar bioenergetic failure and consequently related phenotypes.

Occurrence of mixed populations of influenza A viruses that can be maintained through transmission in a single host and potential for reassortment. Reassortment, which is the rearrangement of viral gene segments in a host cell infected with two different viruses, is an important mechanism for the evolution of influenza viruses. Mixed infections with multiple virus types could lead to reassortment. To better understand the occurrence of quasispecies in a single host, we investigated mixed infections in individual isolates of seasonal influenza A viruses using amantadine sensitivity as a marker. We cultured viruses with amantadine and performed sequencing, restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis, cloning, and quantitative PCR to detect mixed populations. Culturing with amantadine showed evidence of a high number of mixed populations, while the other assays could hardly detect mixed populations. The existence of quasispecies in each isolate was common. However, the proportion of these, which can be less than 1%, is too low to be detected by conventional methods. Such mixed populations in which reassortment occurs may have a significant role in the evolution of viruses.

Neuropsychological, impulsive personality, and cerebral oxygenation correlates of undergraduate polysubstance use. While the relationship between cognitive deficits and impulsive-sensation seeking has been acknowledged in prior research, the impact of impulsive personality style on substance-related cognitive deficits has not been completely elucidated. The present study explored factors related to decision making and executive functioning in 23 polysubstance-using undergraduates and 23 healthy normal controls. Participants' cerebral oxygenation was measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Polysubstance users performed worse on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), and N-Back than did personality-matched controls. They also displayed less dorsolateral prefrontal oxygenation during the IGT. The polysubstance group reported more antisocial characteristics and lower positive affect; controlling for these variables eliminated group differences on the N-Back reaction time. Results suggest that cognitive decrements can be observed in polysubstance-using undergraduates without a lifetime burden of substance use, even after accounting for impulsivity. Results also highlight the importance of considering the contribution of positive mood and antisocial characteristics on executive functioning in polysubstance use.

Targeted quantitation of overexpressed and endogenous cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator using multiple reaction monitoring tandem mass spectrometry and oxygen stable isotope dilution. Cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) functions as an ion channel in the apical plasma membrane of epithelial cells. Mutations in the gene coding for CFTR cause cystic fibrosis (CF). A major cellular dysfunction is insufficient apical plasma membrane expression of the protein. Its correction is important for developing new CF therapeutics and treatments, which requires a sensitive and precise method for quantifying apical plasma membrane CFTR. We report the first method of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry for quantifying endogenous and overexpressed CFTR in HT29 and BHK cells. For low level of endogenous CFTR from HT29, the target protein in the cell lysate was enriched by immunoprecipitation using anti-CFTR antibody MAB3484 or M3A7. For overexpressed CFTR from BHK, the cell lysate prepared by differential detergent fractionation or surface biotinylation was used directly without immunoprecipitation. Proteins in the enriched CFTR preparations or cell lysates were digested with proteases, and a surrogate marker peptide designated as CFTR01 (NSILTETLHR) was successfully quantified using the method of multiple reaction monitoring and stable isotope dilution with an (18)O-labeled reference peptide (CFTR01-(18)O(4)) as the internal standard. CFTR quantified in this work ranged from a few tens of picograms to low nanograms per million of cells.

Electric acoustic stimulation: a new era in prosthetic hearing rehabilitation. Hearing preservation after cochlear implantation and combined electric acoustic stimulation (EAS) in the same ear has reduced the gap between prosthetic hearing rehabilitation with hearing aids and cochlear implants. This has increased the possibility of successful hearing rehabilitation for patients. This paper describes the history of hearing preservation after cochlear implantation. Indications and criteria for combined electric acoustic stimulation are described, and hearing preservation surgery and outcomes achieved with combined EAS are discussed. EAS has led to a new era in prosthetic hearing rehabilitation providing new understanding of basic physiological, psychoacoustic and medical aspects of the inner ear.


Positron emission tomography and granulosa cell tumor recurrence: a report of 2 cases.

Road map of an Ear, Nose, and Throat clinic during the 2008 Hajj in Makkah, Saudi Arabia. To present our experience in the development of our own local electronic Makkah Ear, Nose, and Throat (ENT) - Hajj Database, and provide a road map for the ENT Clinic during Hajj. This prospective cohort study was conducted between November 28 and December 10, 2008 (1429 Hijri Hajj season). All patients presenting to the ENT Clinic at Al-Noor Specialist Hospital, Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia were recorded. A total of 1047 patients were included. The mean age was 26 +/- 6.4 years. There were 663 males (63.3%), and 384 females (36.7%). Among them, 361 patients (34.5%) were Hajjis, and 686 patients (65.5%) were non-Hajji. The total number of Saudi patients were 716 (68.4%), and non-Saudi's were 331 (31.6%). A total of 78.5% of the patients presented during the 12 hours shift (12 PM-12 AM). Upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) including the diagnosis of pharyngitis, viral URTI, and tonsillitis represented 85.2% of the total diagnosis. Twenty-four patients were admitted, with admission conversion rate of 2.3%, and average admission rate is 2 patients per day. Admission in relation to URTI represented 46% of the total admitting diagnosis. In treating these patients, 992 patients (94.7%) received antibiotics as part of, or their main therapy. The ENT Hajj Clinic was a success in improving patient's care, and to help alleviate pressure from the Emergency Department.


Oxidative stress-induced S100B protein from placenta and amnion affects soluble Endoglin release from endothelial cells.

Sudden unexpected death, epilepsy and familial cardiac pathology. We evaluated the prevalence of epilepsy in a cohort of patients who suffered a sudden unexpected death (SUDEP), and determined the proportion of the deaths that were related to an identifiable underlying familial cardiac pathology. Epilepsy is common in people who experience a sudden unexpected death, with approximately a quarter having identifiable familial electrophysiological abnormalities. Familial cardiac pathology may be an important cause of SUDEP. A retrospective evaluation was performed of 74 families that were referred to the Royal Melbourne Hospital Cardiac Genetic Clinic over a 5 year period for investigation following a family member's sudden, presumed cardiac, death. This state-wide referral clinic includes all patients who have died from a sudden unexpected death in whom the cause of death is unascertained. An epilepsy diagnosis was categorised as either definite, probable, possible or unlikely. The family members underwent comprehensive clinical evaluations and investigations in an attempt to identify a familial cardiac cause for the sudden unexpected death. Our findings suggest that systematic referral to a cardiac genetics service is warranted for the first degree relatives of people with epilepsy who experience a sudden unexplained death, for further evaluation and to identify those who are at higher risk for sudden death. Interventions may then be instituted to potentially reduce this risk.

Postgraduate Symposium: The MTHFR C677T polymorphism, B-vitamins and blood pressure. High blood pressure (BP) and elevated homocysteine are reported as independent risk factors for CVD and stroke in particular. The main genetic determinant of homocysteine concentrations is homozygosity (TT genotype) for the C677T polymorphism in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, typically found in approximately 10% of Western populations. The B-vitamins folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6 are the main nutritional determinants of homocysteine, with riboflavin more recently identified as a potent modulator specifically in individuals with the TT genotype. Although observational studies have reported associations between homocysteine and BP, B-vitamin intervention studies have shown little or no BP response despite decreases in homocysteine. Such studies, however, have not considered the MTHFR C677T polymorphism, which has been shown to be associated with BP. It has been shown for the first time that riboflavin is an important determinant of BP specifically in individuals with the TT genotype. Research generally suggests that 24 h ambulatory BP monitoring provides a more accurate measure of BP than casual measurements and its use in future studies may also provide important insights into the relationship between the MTHFR polymorphism and BP. Further research is also required to investigate the association between specific B-vitamins and BP in individuals with different MTHFR genotypes in order to confirm whether any genetic predisposition to hypertension is correctable by B-vitamin intervention. The present review will investigate the evidence linking the MTHFR C677T polymorphism to BP and the potential modulating role of B-vitamins.

miR-372 regulates cell cycle and apoptosis of ags human gastric cancer cell line through direct regulation of LATS2. Previously, we have reported tissue- and stage-specific expression of miR-372 in human embryonic stem cells and so far, not many reports speculate the function of this microRNA (miRNA). In this study, we screened various human cancer cell lines including gastric cancer cell lines and found first time that miR-372 is expressed only in AGS human gastric adenocarcinoma cell line. Inhibition of miR-372 using antisense miR-372 oligonucleotide (AS-miR-372) suppressed proliferation, arrested the cell cycle at G2/M phase, and increased apoptosis of AGS cells. Furthermore, AS-miR-372 treatment increased expression of LATS2, while over-expression of miR-372 decreased luciferase reporter activity driven by the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) of LATS2 mRNA. Over-expression of LATS2 induced changes in AGS cells similar to those in AGS cells treated with AS-miR-372. Taken together, these findings demonstrate an oncogenic role for miR-372 in controlling cell growth, cell cycle, and apoptosis through down-regulation of a tumor suppressor gene, LATS2.

COPD health care in Sweden - A study in primary and secondary care. To map out-patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with special reference to patients suffering from acute exacerbations, and to describe COPD health care structure and process in Swedish clinical practice in a real life setting. Retrospective, non-interventional, epidemiological survey. 141 hospital based out patient clinics (OPC, n=30) and primary health care clinics (PC, n=111) were included in the structure evaluation. 1004 COPD diagnosed patients from 100 of the centres (OPC, n=26) participated in the process evaluation. All Swedish OPC (n=40) and a random sample of 180 PC were asked to answer a questionnaire regarding COPD care. In addition, data from 10 randomly selected patients with a documented COPD disease were analysed from the centres. Spirometers were available at all OPCs and at 99% of the PCs. Spirometry had been performed in 52% of PC-patients and in 89% of OPC-patients during the last 2 years prior to the study. More severe patients, as judged by investigator and lung function data, were treated at OPCs than at PCs. Physiotherapists, occupational therapists and dieticians were available at >80% of centres. Exacerbation rate was higher at PCs without a specialized nurse, 2.2/year versus 0.9/year at centres with a specialized nurse. Special attention to COPD, marked by a specialised nurse in primary care improves the quality, as assessed by a lower number of exacerbations. The structure of COPD care in Sweden for diagnosed individuals seems satisfactory, but could be improved mainly through higher availability and educational activities.

The RNA binding protein tristetraprolin influences the activation state of murine dendritic cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) serve to maintain peripheral tolerance under steady state conditions. Upon triggering by activation signals they initiate strong immune responses. The activation of DCs is accompanied by a rapid upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, which were shown in other cell types to be regulated by mechanisms at the transcriptional and posttranscriptional level. Tristetraprolin (TTP), an important RNA binding protein, is involved in the regulation of mRNA stability of such cytokines. In this study we analyzed the significance of TTP for mouse DCs, which were derived from TTP(-/-) and WT bone marrow progenitor cells (BM-DCs). Unstimulated BM-DCs of TTP(-/-) mice expressed lower levels of mRNAs encoding the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86 and surprisingly also the canonical TTP targets TNF-alpha and IL-10 as compared with WT DCs. On the protein level, both DC populations expressed comparable amounts of CD80 and CD86 and of either cytokine, but TTP(-/-) DCs expressed less MHCII than WT DCs. On the other hand, TTP(-/-) DCs displayed elevated expression of other TTP target mRNAs like IL-1beta, c-fos and Mkp-1. Stimulation of BM-DCs of either genotype with lipopolysaccharide resulted in a rapid upregulation to a comparable extent of all molecules monitored so far, except for c-fos mRNA. Subsequent mRNA decay analysis revealed gene-specific differences in mRNA stability, which was influenced by the presence of TTP and the activation state of the DCs. Unstimulated TTP(-/-) DCs exerted a markedly lower allogeneic T cell stimulatory potential than WT DCs. Moreover, TTP(-/-) DCs induced an altered cytokine pattern in cocultures of DCs and T cells. However, allogeneic T cells primed by unstimulated DCs of either genotype were equally refractory to restimulation and suppressed the proliferation of naive T cells to the same extent. Thus, the findings of this study lend support to the interpretation that without external stimulation antigen presenting activity in DCs in the presence of TTP is more pronounced than in its absence and that posttranscriptional regulation contributes to the control of gene expression in DCs.

Enhanced epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and upregulated MYC in ectopic lesions contribute independently to endometriosis. Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a process in which epithelial cells lose polarity and cell-to-cell contacts and acquire the migratory and invasive abilities of mesenchymal cells. These abilities are thought to be prerequisites for the establishment of endometriotic lesions. A hallmark of EMT is the functional loss of E-cadherin (CDH1) expression in epithelial cells. TWIST1, a transcription factor that represses E-cadherin transcription, is among the EMT inducers. SNAIL, a zinc-finger transcription factor, and its close relative SLUG have similar properties to TWIST1 and are thus also EMT inducers. MYC, which is upregulated by estrogens in the uterus by an estrogen response cis-acting element (ERE) in its promoter, is associated with proliferation in endometriosis. The role of EMT and proliferation in the pathogenesis of endometriosis was evaluated by analyzing TWIST1, CDH1 and MYC expression. CDH1, TWIST1, SNAIL and SLUG mRNA expression was analyzed by qRT-PCR from 47 controls and 74 patients with endometriosis. Approximately 42 ectopic and 62 eutopic endometrial tissues, of which 30 were matched samples, were collected during the same surgical procedure. We evaluated TWIST1 and MYC protein expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the epithelial and stromal tissue of 69 eutopic and 90 ectopic endometrium samples, of which 49 matched samples were analyzed from the same patient. Concordant expression of TWIST1/SNAIL/SLUG and CDH1 but also of TWIST1 and MYC was analyzed. We found that TWIST1, SNAIL and SLUG are overexpressed (pâ<â0.001, pâ=â0.016 and pâ<â0.001) in endometriosis, while CDH1 expression was concordantly reduced in these samples (pâ<â0.001). Similar to TWIST1, the epithelial expression of MYC was also significantly enhanced in ectopic endometrium compared to eutopic tissues (pâ=â0.008). We found exclusive expression of either TWIST1 or MYC in the same samples (pâ=â0.003). Epithelial TWIST1 is overexpressed in endometriosis and may contribute to the formation of endometriotic lesions by inducing epithelial to mesenchymal transition, as CDH1 was reduced in ectopic lesions. We found exclusive expression of either TWIST1 or MYC in the same samples, indicating that EMT and proliferation contribute independently of each other to the formation of endometriotic lesions.

[Individual fecundity of Culter alburnus in Xujiahe Reservoir of China]. In April - June 2008, the matured female Culter alburnus specimens were collected from the Xujiahe Reservoir of China. Their ages were identified by the scales, and their body length, body mass, gonad mass, and other morphological indices were measured. Counted with gravimetric method, the individual absolute fecundity was obtained, and used for calculating the relative fecundity per centimetre, relative fecundity per gram, maturity, relative fatness, and other indices. Based on these measurements and calculations, the relationships between the individual fecundity and the morphological indices of C. alburnus in the Reservoir were studied. The ages of the specimens ranged from 2+ to 5+ years old, and the individual absolute fecundity and relative fecundity per centimetre were exponentially correlated with body length and body mass, and linearly correlated with age. No significant correlations were observed between the relative fecundity per gram and these morphological indices. Multi-regressive analyses showed that the individual absolute fecundity was significantly correlated with body mass and gonad mass, the relative fecundity per centimetre was significantly correlated with gonad mass, relative fatness and maturity, while the relative fecundity per gram was only correlated with maturity.

Extraction of P300 using constrained independent component analysis. A brain computer interface (BCI) uses electrophysiological activities of the brain such as natural rhythms and evoked potentials to communicate with some external devices. P300 is a positive evoked potential (EP), elicited approximately 300 ms after an attended external stimulus. A P300-based BCI uses this evoked potential as a means of communication with the external devices. Until now this P300-based BCI has been rather slow, as it is difficult to detect a P300 response without averaging over a number of trials. Previously, independent component analysis (ICA) has been used in the extraction of P300. However, the drawback of ICA is that it extracts not only P300 but also non-P300 related components requiring a proper selection of P300 ICs by the system. In this study we propose an algorithm based on constrained independent component analysis (cICA) for P300 extraction which can extract only the relevant component by incorporating a priori information. A reference signal is generated as this a priori information of P300 and cICA is applied to extract the P300 related component. Then the extracted P300 IC is segmented, averaged, and classified into target and non-target events by means of a linear classifier. The method is fast, reliable, computationally inexpensive as compared to ICA and achieves an accuracy of 98.3% in the detection of P300.

Magnetic cell sorting and flow cytometry sorting methods for the isolation and function analysis of mouse CD4+ CD25+ Treg cells. In this paper we compared the two methods of cell sorting (magnetic cell sorting and flow cytometry sorting) for the isolation and function analysis of mouse CD4(+) CD25(+) regulatory T (Treg) cells, in order to inform further studies in Treg cell function. We separately used magnetic cell sorting and flow cytometry sorting to identify CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg cells. After magnetic cell separation, we further used flow cytometry to analyze the purity of CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg cells, trypan blue staining to detect cell viability, and propidium iodide (PI) staining to assess the cell viability. We detected the immune inhibition of CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg cells in the in vitro proliferation experiments. The results showed that compared to flow cytometry sorting, magnetic cell sorting took more time and effort, but fewer live cells were obtained than with flow cytometry sorting. The CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg cells, however, obtained with both methods have similar immunosuppressive capacities. The result suggests that both methods can be used in isolating CD4(+) CD25(+) Treg cells, and one can select the best method according to specific needs and availability of the methodologies.

Cocaine addiction: diffusion tensor imaging study of the inferior frontal and anterior cingulate white matter.

Ambulatory cleft lip repair. Ambulatory cleft lip repair has been practiced in developed countries, but its safety has never been examined in developing countries. This study compares the outcomes of ambulatory cleft lip repair with the inpatient setting. A retrospective cohort study of 122 patients who underwent repair between 2000 and 2008 was conducted. All patients underwent primary cleft lip repair performed by the same surgeon. Patients were divided into two groups: ambulatory (n = 58) and inpatient (n = 64). Demographics, surgical parameters, and outcomes were obtained. The main outcome measure examined was the overall readmission rate. Mean patient age was 133 days in the ambulatory group and 154 days in the inpatient group. Six patients (10.3 percent) in the ambulatory group and 15 (23.4 percent) in the inpatient group had associated medical problems. Both groups were homogeneous for other parameters. Three patients (5.2 percent) in the ambulatory group and two (3.1 percent) in the inpatient group were readmitted. There were no significant differences in the readmission rate, intraoperative or postoperative complications, or rate of return to the emergency room (p > 0.05). However, the reason for readmission was different in the two groups, consisting of respiratory problems in the ambulatory group and late wound dehiscence in the inpatient group. This study confirms the safety of ambulatory cleft lip repair in a developing country. However, the authors suggest hospital admission for patients with preexisting cardiac problems and those who experience any respiratory problems in the immediate postoperative period in the ambulatory group.

[Clinical and endoscopic characteristics of esophagitis and emotionally-personal sphere of patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease]. Examination of morphological features, clinical symptoms and psychological status in 114 patients with endoscopically positive type of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) revealed that intensity of heartburn depends on the extent of inflammatory and erosive changes in the oesophageal mucous membrane. It has an effect on the emotional sphere of patients and contributes the development of depression, anxiety and phobia tendencies with psychical disadaptation, somnolent disorders and the decrease of the quality of life. These data must be interpreted within the conception of pathogenesis of GERD and the individual methods of its prevention, treatment and reablement.

Evaluation of optic neuropathy in multiple sclerosis using low-contrast visual evoked potentials. Contrast acuity (identification of low-contrast letters on a white background) is frequently reduced in patients with demyelinating optic neuropathy associated with multiple sclerosis (MS), even when high-contrast (Snellen) visual acuity is normal. Since visual evoked potentials (VEPs) induced with high-contrast pattern-reversal stimuli are typically increased in latency in demyelinating optic neuropathy, we asked if VEPs induced with low-contrast stimuli would be more prolonged and thus helpful in identifying demyelinating optic neuropathy in MS. We studied 15 patients with clinically definite MS and 15 age-matched normal controls. All subjects underwent a neuro-ophthalmologic assessment, including measurement of high-contrast visual acuity and low-contrast acuities with 25%, 10%, 5%, 2.5%, and 1.25% contrast Sloan charts. In patients with MS, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness was determined using optical coherence tomography. Monocular VEPs were induced using pattern-reversal checkerboard stimuli with 100% and 10% contrast between checks, at 5 spatial frequencies (8-130 minutes of arc). VEP latencies were significantly increased in response to low- compared with high-contrast stimuli in both groups. VEP latencies were significantly greater in patients with MS than controls for both high- and low-contrast stimuli. VEP latencies correlated with high- and low-contrast visual acuities and RNFL thickness. VEPs were less likely to be induced with low- than with high-contrast stimuli in eyes with severe residual visual loss. Visual evoked potentials obtained in patients with multiple sclerosis using low-contrast stimuli are increased in latency or absent when compared with those obtained using high-contrast stimuli and, thus, may prove to be helpful in identifying demyelinating optic neuropathy.

Impact of Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines on Screening for Chlamydia. The highest prevalence of chlamydia infection in the United States is among people aged 15 to 24 years. We assessed the impact of not doing routine cervical cancer screening on the rates of chlamydia screening in women aged 15 to 21 years. We classified visits to family medicine ambulatory clinics according to their timing relative to the 2009 guideline change that led to more restrictive cervical cancer screening. Women had higher odds of being screened for chlamydia before vs after the guideline change (odds ratio = 13.97; 95% CI, 9.17-21.29; P <.001). Chlamydia and cervical cancer screening need to be uncoupled and new screening opportunities should be identified. 


Comparing eccentric resistance exercise in prostate cancer survivors on and off hormone therapy: a pilot study.

New hemostatic agents in the combat setting. Hemorrhage is a leading cause of potentially preventable death in both civilian and military trauma patients. Animal data have shown that hemostatic bandages reduce hemorrhage and improve survival. This article reports recent clinical observations regarding the efficacy and evolution of use of two new hemostatic bandages employed in the global war on terrorism. We performed a retrospective cohort review of soldiers treated with either the QuikClot or HemCon hemostatic bandages between April and October 2006. Hemostatic dressings were placed on wounds either in the field or at the combat support hospital (CSH). During the 6-month study period, 1691 trauma patients were admitted to the CSH. Fifty uses of hemostatic dressings in 44 patients (2.6% of admissions) were identified. Forty patients were treated with HemCon dressings, three patients with QuikClot, and one with both QuikClot and HemCon. Eighteen percent of the dressings were used in the field, predominantly on extremity wounds (7/8). In contrast, most dressings used in the CSH were for truncal wounds (26/36 patients). Hemostatic dressings were applied to extremity wounds in prehospital and hospital settings, either alone or in conjunction with tourniquets. In surviving patients (95%), the treating surgeon determined that the hemorrhage was either stopped or greatly decreased by use of hemostatic dressings. Two of the four patients treated with QuikClot had burns from exothermic reactions, while no adverse reactions were noted with HemCon. Hemostatic agents stop or decrease bleeding. Whereas HemCon appears to be safe, QuikClot may produce superficial burns. These new hemostatic agents have a place in the surgical armamentarium to assist in controlling internal hemorrhage from truncal and pelvic hemorrhage, especially during damage-control surgery.

Automated assignment of ionization states in broad-mass matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization spectra of protein mixtures. A computational technique is presented for the automated assignment of the multiple charge and multimer states (ionization states) in the time-of-flight (TOF) domain for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) spectra. Examples of the application of this technique include an improved, automatic calibration over the 2 to 70 kDa mass range and a reduced data redundancy after reconstruction of the molecular spectrum of only singly charged monomers. This method builds on our previously reported enhancement of broad-mass signal detection, and includes two steps: (1) an automated correction of the instrumental acquisition initial time delay, and (2) a recursive TOF detection of multiple charge states and singly charged multimers of molecular [MH](+) ions over the entire record range, based on MALDI methods. The technique is tested using calibration mixtures and pooled serum quality control samples acquired along with clinical study data. The described automated procedure improves the analysis and dimension reduction of MS data for comparative proteomics applications.

Detailed characterization of 2-heptanone conversion by dielectric barrier discharge in N(2) and N(2)/O(2) mixtures. The products of 2-heptanone conversion by dielectric barrier discharge plasma are analyzed under different conditions: alternating current (ac) or pulsed mode of excitation, variable energy, variable composition of the carrier gas. The efficiency of the conversion is higher using a pulse excitation mode than an ac mode. With a small oxygen percentage (about 2-3%) added to nitrogen, 2-heptanone is about 30% more efficiently removed than in pure nitrogen, while the 2-heptanone removal decreases with an oxygen percentage higher than 3%. A new analysis method, based on chemical ionization mass spectrometry, is used for volatile organic compound detection along with chromatography. Several products issued from 2-heptanone conversion with ac excitation are identified in nitrogen and in air, and a chemical scheme is proposed to explain their formation and their treatment by the discharge. It appears that byproducts are issued not only from oxidation reactions, but also from C-C bond cleavage by collisions with electrons or nitrogen excited states.

Leukocyte density and composition in human cycling endometrium with uterine fibroids. In this study, we evaluated the leukocyte density and composition in the human cycling endometrium with uterine fibroids (UF). The endometrium with neighboring nodule (NN group, n = 62), autologous endometrium without NN (non-NN group, n = 62), and allogeneic endometrium without UF (non-UF group, n = 24) were immunostained for the leukocyte common and subset-specific antigens. The immunoreactive cells in the unit areas were enumerated under a light microscope. The stromal pan-leukocyte density in the proliferative phase was significantly higher in the endometrium in the NN group than in the non-NN group. The macrophage density was higher in the NN group than in the non-NN group throughout the menstrual cycle. The NK cell density in the mid-to-late secretory phase was lower in the NN group than in the non-NN group. The T cell density in the midsecretory phase was higher in the non-NN group than in the non-UF group. The neutrophil density in the proliferative phase was higher in the non-NN group than in the non-UF group. The leukocyte density and composition in the endometrium with UF are different from those without UF, suggesting their local effects on endometrial leukocyte population.

Pulmonary Manifestations of Neuromuscular Diseases. Neuromuscular disorders comprise a phenotypically diverse group of inherited and acquired diseases; however, they share common pathophysiologic mechanisms which produce significant respiratory complications. Respiratory and bulbar muscle weakness gives rise to ineffective cough, swallowing dysfunction results in aspiration-related lung disease, and abnormal muscle tone produces chest wall deformities - all of which ultimately leads to repeated chest infections and chronic respiratory failure. In this article, the authors describe the respiratory manifestations of neuromuscular disease and their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. This review also highlights the diagnostic and management tools recommended for acute and chronic care. Aggressive pulmonary management is the most impactful at reducing the overall morbidity and improving the quality of life of children with neuromuscular disorders, at least while definitive molecular and gene replacement therapies remain elusive.

Is Culex modestus (Diptera: Culicidae), vector of West Nile virus, spreading in the Dombes area, France? As a main vector of West Nile (WN) virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus) in Europe, Culex modestus Ficalbi (Diptera: Culicidae) is commonly found in delta regions, lakes, and ponds. The Dombes area is located along one of the main corridors of bird migrations in France and lies 300 km north of the Camargue region, a frequent focus of WN virus circulation. It is an important breeding, wintering, and stopover site for many bird species that are putative carriers of viruses of different kinds. It is also a continental wetland with approximately =1200 fish farming ponds, scattered over the area, that provide suitable breeding sites for Cx. modestus. This article reports an entomological study based on larval surveys conducted in ponds in 2007 to assess the prevalence and abundance of Cx. modestus in the Dombes. Using the larval survey as an ecological screening test, we investigated the proportion of ponds found positive for Cx. modestus, and the relative abundance of this species was estimated in larval samples. We found that its pond distribution was more extensive in the 2007 survey than in that conducted in the 1970s. Survey methods and meteorological and anthropological factors that could account for the differences or variations between the findings of the two investigations are discussed.


GABAergic interneuron dysfunction impairs hippocampal neurogenesis in adult apolipoprotein E4 knockin mice.

Basal host resistance of barley to powdery mildew: connecting quantitative trait Loci and candidate genes. The basal resistance of barley to powdery mildew (Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei) is a quantitatively inherited trait that is based on nonhypersensitive mechanisms of defense. A functional genomic approach indicates that many plant candidate genes are involved in the defense against formation of fungal haustoria. It is not known which of these candidate genes have allelic variation that contributes to the natural variation in powdery mildew resistance, because many of them may be highly conserved within the barley species and may act downstream of the basal resistance reaction. Twenty-two expressed sequence tag or cDNA clone sequences that are likely to play a role in the barley-Blumeria interaction based on transcriptional profiling, gene silencing, or overexpression data, as well as mlo, Ror1, and Ror2, were mapped and considered candidate genes for contribution to basal resistance. We mapped the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for powdery mildew resistance in six mapping populations of barley at seedling and adult plant stages and developed an improved high-density integrated genetic map containing 6,990 markers for comparing QTL and candidate gene positions over mapping populations. We mapped 12 QTL at seedling stage and 13 QTL at adult plant stage, of which four were in common between the two developmental stages. Six of the candidate genes showed coincidence in their map positions with the QTL identified for basal resistance to powdery mildew. This co-localization justifies giving priority to those six candidate genes to validate them as being responsible for the phenotypic effects of the QTL for basal resistance.

Higher Body Mass Index Is Associated with Subjective Olfactory Dysfunction.

Diet, body composition, and bone mass in well-trained cyclists. Cycling is believed to be associated with low bone mass. In this study, we investigate food intake, body composition, and bone mass in well-trained young adult cyclists compared with those in sedentary controls. Four-day estimated diet records were used to study dietary intake in 31 cyclists and 28 sedentary controls (all male, 24yr old on average), together with maximal oxygen uptake (VO(2max)), body composition, and bone mass measurements (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry). The VO(2max) values were twice as high as those in the cyclists, whereas no significant difference in bone mass was observed between cyclists and controls. A total of 10 cyclists and 9 controls had low bone mass. Total-body lean mass and appendicular skeletal muscle mass were higher in cyclists (p<0.001), whereas percentage of body fat was lower (p<0.001) compared with that of the controls. Energy and macro- and micronutrient intake was higher in the cyclists than in the controls (p<0.01). Energy consumption was considered adequate in the cyclists, whereas lipid and protein intake was higher than the American College of Sports Medicine recommendation. Lipid consumption negatively correlated with bone mass in the athletes. Our results demonstrate that cycling was associated with greater aerobic conditioning and lean mass without significant association with bone mass compared with sedentary controls.

Decreased BDNF levels in CSF of drug-naive first-episode psychotic subjects: correlation with plasma BDNF and psychopathology. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which plays an important role in neurodevelopmental plasticity and cognitive performance, has been implicated in neuropsychopathology of schizophrenia. We examined the levels of both cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma BDNF concomitantly in drug-naive first-episode psychotic (FEP) subjects with ELISA to determine if these levels were different from control values and if any correlation exists between CSF and plasma BDNF levels. A significant reduction in BDNF protein levels was observed in both plasma and CSF of FEP subjects compared to controls. BDNF levels showed significant negative correlation with the scores of baseline PANSS positive symptom subscales. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between plasma and CSF BDNF levels in FEP subjects. The parallel changes in BDNF levels in plasma and CSF indicate that plasma BDNF levels reflect the brain changes in BDNF levels in schizophrenia.

Primary malignant melanoma of the small intestine: a case report. The small intestine is the most common site of gastro-intestinal metastasis from cutaneous malignant melanoma. A primary origin at this site has been reported in rare cases. We report a case of a 71-year-old man with a primary malignant melanoma in the jejunum. The patient presented with weakness, weight loss, non-specific abdominal pain and episodes of fainting. After clinical examination, laboratory evaluation and radiological work-up, which included CT of the abdomen, the patient was diagnosed with a tumour mass in the jejunum. This diagnosis was confirmed at laparotomy. The patient underwent enterectomy with wide excision of the tumour. A primary malignant melanoma of the small intestine is an extremely rare neoplasm. A definite diagnosis can only be made after a thorough investigation has been made to exclude the co-existence of a primary lesion elsewhere. Curative resection of the tumour remains the treatment of choice.

The Aqueous Calyx Extract of Hibiscus sabdariffa Lowers Blood Pressure and Heart Rate via Sympathetic Nervous System Dependent Mechanisms. The antihypertensive effect of Hibiscus sabdariffa (HS) has been validated in animals and man. This study tested the hypothesis that its hypotensive effect may be sympathetically mediated. The cold pressor test (CPT) and handgrip exercise (HGE) were performed in 20 healthy subjects before and after the oral administration of 15mg/Kg HS. The blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) responses were measured digitally. Mean arterial pressure (MAP; taken as representative BP) was calculated. Results are expressed as mean Â±SEM. P&lt;0.05 was considered significant. CPT without HS resulted in a significant rise in MAP and HR (111.1Â±2.1mmHg and 100.8Â±2.0/min) from the basal values (97.9Â±1.9mmHg and 87.8Â±2.1/min; P&lt;0.0001 respectively). In the presence of HS, CPT-induced changes (ÎMAP=10.1Â±1.7mmHg; ÎHR= 8.4Â±1.0/min) were significantly reduced compared to its absence (ÎMAP= 13.2Â±1.2mmHg; ÎHR= 13.8Â±1.6/min; P&lt;0.0001 respectively). The HGE done without HS also resulted in an increase in MAP and HR (116.3Â±2.1mmHg and 78.4Â±1.2/min) from the basal values (94.8Â±1.6mmHg and 76.1Â±1.0/min; p&lt;0.0001 respectively). In the presence of HS the HGE-induced changes (ÎMAP= 11.5Â±1.0mmHg; ÎHR= 3.3Â±1.0/min) were significantly decreased compared to its absence (ÎMAP=21.4Â±1.2mmHg; ÎHR= 12.8Â±2.0/min; P&lt;0.0001 respectively). The CPT and HGE -induced increases in BP and HR suggest Sympathetic nervous system activation. These increases were significantly dampened by HS suggesting, indirectly, that its hypotensive effect may be due to an attenuation of the discharge of the sympathetic nervous system. 

An ECVAG trial on assessment of oxidative damage to DNA measured by the comet assay. The increasing use of single cell gel electrophoresis (the comet assay) highlights its popularity as a method for detecting DNA damage, including the use of enzymes for assessment of oxidatively damaged DNA. However, comparison of DNA damage levels between laboratories can be difficult due to differences in assay protocols (e.g. lysis conditions, enzyme treatment, the duration of the alkaline treatment and electrophoresis) and in the end points used for reporting results (e.g. %DNA in tail, arbitrary units, tail moment and tail length). One way to facilitate comparisons is to convert primary comet assay end points to number of lesions/10(6) bp by calibration with ionizing radiation. The aim of this study was to investigate the inter-laboratory variation in assessment of oxidatively damaged DNA by the comet assay in terms of oxidized purines converted to strand breaks with formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase (FPG). Coded samples with DNA oxidation damage induced by treatment with different concentrations of photosensitizer (Ro 19-8022) plus light and calibration samples irradiated with ionizing radiation were distributed to the 10 participating laboratories to measure DNA damage using their own comet assay protocols. Nine of 10 laboratories reported the same ranking of the level of damage in the coded samples. The variation in assessment of oxidatively damaged DNA was largely due to differences in protocols. After conversion of the data to lesions/10(6) bp using laboratory-specific calibration curves, the variation between the laboratories was reduced. The contribution of the concentration of photosensitizer to the variation in net FPG-sensitive sites increased from 49 to 73%, whereas the inter-laboratory variation decreased. The participating laboratories were successful in finding a dose-response of oxidatively damaged DNA in coded samples, but there remains a need to standardize the protocols to enable direct comparisons between laboratories.

Synthesis and biological evaluation of N-aryl-1,4-dihydropyridines as novel antidyslipidemic and antioxidant agents. N-aryl-1,4-dihydropyridines 2a-n were synthesized via iodine catalyzed three-component reaction of cinnamaldehydes, anilines and 2-keto esters in methanol. The synthesized compounds were screened for their antidyslipidemic and antioxidant activity in vivo and in vitro. Compounds 2a, 2g, and 2l have exhibited promising lipid and TG lowering activity, whereas compounds 2m and 2n have showed potent antioxidant activity.

MICROBIAL SPECTRUM AND OUTCOMES OF ENDOPHTHALMITIS AFTER INTRAVITREAL INJECTION VERSUS PARS PLANA VITRECTOMY. To compare infectious organisms and visual outcomes of endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection (IVI) with endophthalmitis after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). Retrospective, comparative, consecutive case series of patients diagnosed with presumed infectious endophthalmitis after IVI of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor medication or PPV between January 1, 2009, and October 1, 2012, from one center. Main outcome measures were infectious organism and final visual acuity. Forty-four cases of presumed infectious endophthalmitis (17 culture positive) occurred after IVI and 19 cases (9 culture positive) occurred after PPV. Of note, 56.3% of culture-positive IVI cases were due to bacteria associated with oral flora, primarily Streptococcus species, compared with none in the PPV group (P = 0.01). There was a trend approaching significance for IVI patients to have lost â¥3 lines of visual acuity compared with PPV patients at final follow-up (P = 0.07). Within the IVI group, patients were more likely to have lost â¥6 lines of visual acuity at final follow-up when endophthalmitis was due to an organism associated with oral flora (P = 0.007). Endophthalmitis after IVI has a higher likelihood of being due to oral flora compared with endophthalmitis after PPV. Among IVI patients, worse visual outcomes occurred when endophthalmitis was due to oral flora.

Maturation of a Trypanosoma brucei infection to the infectious metacyclic stage is enhanced in nutritionally stressed tsetse flies. We report on the effect of tsetse fly starvation on the maturation of an established Trypanosoma brucei brucei midgut infection, i.e., the development of procyclic infection into the infectious metacyclic parasites in the tsetse fly salivary glands. Glossina morsitans morsitans flies were nutritionally stressed 10 d after the uptake of a T. b. brucei-infected bloodmeal by depriving these flies from feeding for seven consecutive days, whereas the control fly group (nonstarved group) continued to be fed three times a week. After this period, both fly groups were again fed three times per week on uninfected rabbit. Thirty days after the infected bloodmeal, all surviving flies were dissected and examined for the presence of an immature midgut and a mature salivary gland trypanosome infections. Results showed a significantly increased proportion of flies with salivary gland infection in the nutritionally stressed fly group suggesting an enhanced maturation of the trypanosome infection. These data suggest that environmental factors that cause nutritional stress in a tsetse population do not only make tsetse flies significantly more susceptible to establish a midgut infection as was shown previously but also boost the maturation of these midgut infections.

Modification of innervation pattern by fluoroquinolone treatment in the rat salivary glands. Fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQAs) are widely used in dental and medical therapy. Despite their known severe adverse actions on the central and peripheral nervous system, little attention has been directed toward the potential toxic side effects of these compounds on the oral tissues. As the saliva secretion is controlled by the nervous system and neuropeptides, the neurotoxic effect of pefloxacin (PEF), a representative member of FQAs, was studied in rats in the present work. Previously, we demonstrated a significant weight loss of parotid gland tissue, a marked decrease in 3H-thymidine incorporation, a decreased volume of saliva and amylase activity of the glandular tissue in response to PEF. Animals received intraperitoneal injection of PEF (20 mg/100 g body weight daily) for 3 and 7 days. Normal histology, and neurofilament 200, substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related polypeptide (CGRP) containing nerve fibers were detected with immunohistochemical methods. A marked decrease of the weights in salivary glands and the acinar diameters were measured. Similarly, a strong and significant decrease of the number of SP and CGRP containing nerve fibers were detected. These findings suggest that the impaired morphology and innervation pattern of salivary glands is related to the neurotoxic adverse effect of FQA treatment.

A Mathematical Model of Quorum Sensing Induced Biofilm Detachment. Cell dispersal (or detachment) is part of the developmental cycle of microbial biofilms. It can be externally or internally induced, and manifests itself in discrete sloughing events, whereby many cells disperse in an instance, or in continuous slower dispersal of single cells. One suggested trigger of cell dispersal is quorum sensing, a cell-cell communication mechanism used to coordinate gene expression and behavior in groups based on population densities. To better understand the interplay of colony growth and cell dispersal, we develop a dynamic, spatially extended mathematical model that includes biofilm growth, production of quorum sensing molecules, cell dispersal triggered by quorum sensing molecules, and re-attachment of cells. This is a highly nonlinear system of diffusion-reaction equations that we study in computer simulations. Our results show that quorum sensing induced cell dispersal can be an efficient mechanism for bacteria to control the size of a biofilm colony, and at the same time enhance its downstream colonization potential. In fact we find that over the lifetime of a biofilm colony the majority of cells produced are lost into the aqueous phase, supporting the notion of biofilms as cell nurseries. We find that a single quorum sensing based mechanism can explain both, discrete dispersal events and continuous shedding of cells from a colony. Moreover, quorum sensing induced cell dispersal affects the structure and architecture of the biofilm, for example it might lead to the formation of hollow inner regions in a biofilm colony.

Redox regulation of the MED28 and MED32 mediator subunits is important for development and senescence. Mediator is a conserved multi-protein complex that acts as a bridge between promoter-bound transcriptional regulators and RNA polymerase II. While redox signaling is important in adjusting plant metabolism and development, the involvement of Mediator in redox homeostasis and regulation only recently started to emerge. Our previous results show that the MED10a, MED28, and MED32 Mediator subunits form various types of covalent oligomers linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds in vitro. To link that with biological significance we have characterized Arabidopsis med32 and med28 mutants and found that they are affected in root development and senescence, phenotypes possibly associated to redox changes. 

[Effect of bushen kangshuai tablet on NF-kappaB signal pathway and inflammation factors in rabbits with experimental atherosclerosis]. To observe the intervening effect and acting mechanism of Bushen Kangshuai Tablet (BKT) on rabbits' atherosclerosis (AS). Thirty-six white Japanese rabbits were randomly divided into four groups: 6 in the normal control group, and each 10 in the model group, the BKT group and the simvastatin group. The AS model was established by high fatty diet feeding from the 1st to the 10th week, combined with immune injury at the 2nd week and femoral arterial balloon tearing at the 4th week. The medication of BKT and simvastatin was given during the whole 10-week course. Levels of triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), interleukin-1 (IL-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured at the beginning and the 3rd, 6th and 10th weekend of the experiment. The nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) expression in the aortic wall, ratio of plaque area to intima area (PA/IA), intima thickness (IT), aortic intima/media thickness ratio (IT/MT) and intima hyperplasia index (IHI) were measured at the terminal of the experiment. The correlation analysis was conducted between serum lipids, inflammation factors and IHI. Compared with the normal control group, all indices of the blood lipids and Inflammation factors measured at various time points, and the PA/IA, IT/MT ratios as well as IHI in the model group were higher (P<0.01, P<0.05). Compared with the model group, the levels of IL-1, MCP-1, TNF-alpha, NF-kappaB as well as the ratios of PA/IA, IT/MT and IHI were lower in the two treated groups at all time points after treatment (P<0.01 or P<0.05). Pearson correlation analysis showed positive correlation between TC with IL-1, and TNF-alpha with IHI in the model group (P< 0.05); also between TC with IHI, IL-1 with IHI, and TNF-alpha with IHI and IL-1 in the BKT group (P<0.05), while no correlation between blood lipids with inflammation factors was observed. BKT could suppress the inflammation reaction in rabbits to prevent AS formation, the action is not directly correlated with the blood lipid level.


The role of preterm placental calcification on assessing risks of stillbirth.

CD40-expressing plasmid induces anti-CD40 antibody and enhances immune responses to DNA vaccination. Various approaches have been used to improve the efficacy of DNA vaccination, including the incorporation of molecular adjuvants. Because the CD40 ligand-CD40 interaction plays a major role in initiating immune responses, we sought to develop a molecular adjuvant targeting this interaction. We immunized mice with a foot-and-mouth disease virus DNA vaccine, pcD-VP1, together with a CD40-expressing plasmid, pcD-CD40. We found that pcD-CD40 induced anti-CD40 antibodies, which temporally correlated with the augmented production of anti-VP1 antibody. pcD-CD40 similarly augmented the humoral response of another DNA vaccine that targets hepatitis B virus, and passive transfer of anti-CD40 antisera also showed a similar effect. Furthermore, the pcD-CD40-elicited anti-CD40 antibodies were able to activate the CD40 signal pathway in antigen-presenting cells in vitro, which led to the maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) and DC-mediated T cell activation. Thus, pcD-CD40 augments DNA vaccination by inducing anti-CD40 antibodies, which in turn promotes T cell activation. This is the first reported 'proadjuvant' that augments DNA vaccination indirectly by eliciting agonistic antibodies.

Pediatric traumatic dural arteriovenous fistula. Dural arteriovenous fistulas are uncommon lesions in children, with traumatic lesions suspected to arise from incomplete arterial injury in proximity to a vein or draining sinus. Management of symptomatic acquired lesions requires evaluation of patient presentation, neurological status, and pathoanatomic configuration, with special consideration required for surgery secondary to failed endovascular technique. A 12-year-old male sustained a bicycle fall causing a right temporo-parietal skull fracture associated with non-surgical right epidural hematoma and left contre-coup parietal contusion. Six-weeks later, he complained of a right temporal bruit with subsequent cerebral angiography demonstrating a dural-based fistula between the right middle meningeal artery and a dural vein draining into the sigmoid sinus. Endovascular treatment of this lesion with glue embolization and coiling was unsuccessful, with angiographic illustration of previously unobserved collateral vessels and coils occupying the sigmoid sinus. A right temporo-parietal craniectomy was required to excise the dural-based fistula, followed by dural defect repair with bovine pericardium and subsequent cranioplasty. Six years later the patient remains neurologically intact with no headaches or bruit. Dural arteriovenous fistula can uncommonly occur following traumatic injury in children. Partial injury to the middle mengineal artery may have established arterial communication with the draining vein that became ectatic and tortuous under high pressure. Failure of primary endovascular treatment may complicate secondary surgical intervention.

An analysis of efficacy data from four phase III studies of botulinum neurotoxin type A-ABO for the treatment of glabellar lines. A new formulation of a botulinum neurotoxin type A (BoNTA-ABO; Dysport [abobotulinumtoxinA], Medicis Aesthetics, Scottsdale, AZ) has recently been approved in the United States for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines. We describe the results of four phase III studies of BoNTA-ABO for the treatment of glabellar lines. Of the four studies reported here, three were double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled studies and one was an open-label extension study. A second phase III, open-label extension study is ongoing. Studies enrolled ethnically diverse, healthy adults with glabellar lines of at least moderate severity at maximum frown. Patients were followed for up to 180 days after treatment. The fixed-dose, single treatment study randomized 158 patients to receive placebo or a single 50-unit BoNTA-ABO dose. The fixed-dose, repeat treatment study enrolled 311 patients to assess treatment following repeat BoNTA-ABO treatment of 50 units. A variable-dose study randomized 816 patients to receive placebo or a single variable dose (50 to 80 units, based on gender and muscle mass assessment). The fourth phase III study was open-label to evaluate repeat dosing (50 units). Clinical evaluations were performed on days 14 and 30, and monthly thereafter. Primary efficacy endpoints were based on the investigators' and patients' assessment of glabellar line severity at day 30 using wrinkle severity rating scales. Responders were defined as patients who had a composite 2+ grade improvement in wrinkle severity, meaning that a patient had a baseline Glabellar Line Severity Scale (GLSS) score of 2 (moderate glabellar lines) and a day 30 GLSS score of 0 (no glabellar lines/none), or a baseline GLSS score of 3 (severe glabellar lines) and a day 30 GLSS score of 0 (no glabellar lines/none) or 1 (mild glabellar lines), for both the blinded investigator's and patient's assessments. Patients (1116 total; 720 BoNTA-ABO, 396 placebo) treated with BoNTA-ABO received 50 to 80 units. The median duration of response was 85 days for fixed dosing and 109 days for variable dosing. Similar efficacy occurred at doses adjusted for gender and muscle mass, although male patients required higher doses than female patients in the variable-dose study. Responses appeared as early as 24 hours, with a median time to onset of three days. The open-label extension study evaluated 1200 patients for 13 months. Maintenance of efficacy was seen after multiple treatment cycles, indicating that patients did not develop a tolerance. A second open-label study is ongoing and is not included in this report. BoNTA-ABO significantly improved moderate to severe glabellar lines compared with placebo, with onset of effect seen as soon as 24 hours after treatment and a median duration of effect of 85 and 109 days for fixed and variable dosing, respectively.

Assembly of endogenous oskar mRNA particles for motor-dependent transport in the Drosophila oocyte. oskar mRNA localization at the oocyte posterior pole is essential for correct patterning of the Drosophila embryo. Here we show at the ultrastructural level that endogenous oskar ribonucleoprotein complexes (RNPs) assemble sequentially with initial recruitment of Hrp48 and the exon junction complex (EJC) to oskar transcripts in the nurse cell nuclei, and subsequent recruitment of Staufen and microtubule motors, following transport to the cytoplasm. oskar particles are non-membrane-bound structures that coalesce as they move from the oocyte anterior to the posterior pole. Our analysis uncovers a role for the EJC component Barentsz in recruiting Tropomyosin II (TmII) to oskar particles in the ooplasm and reveals that TmII is required for kinesin binding to the RNPs. Finally, we show that both kinesin and dynein associate with oskar particles and are the primary microtubule motors responsible for transport of the RNPs within the oocyte.

[Effects of epidermal growth factor receptor on airway inflammation in a rat asthmatic model]. To explore the possible roles of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the process of acute and chronic airway inflammation in a rat asthmatic model. Forty-five Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into control groups (subgroups A1, A2, A4), asthmatic groups (subgroups B1, B2, B4) and treatment groups (subgroups C1, C2, C4), with 5 mice in each subgroup. Mice in the asthmatic and treatment groups were exposed to OVA challenge for 1 week, 2 weeks and 4 weeks. Rats in the treatment groups received intraperitoneal injection of a tyrosine kinase inhibitor Genistein (Rongli China) with the dose of 20 mg/kg 1 hour before OVA exposure. Total cell counts and cell differentials in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were performed. A semi-quantified method of airway inflammation score was used to evaluate airway inflammation by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Expression of EGFR and tyrosine phosphorylation (EGFR activation) in airway epithelium at different times of OVA exposure were evaluated by immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence. All data were expressed as mean +/- SD. One-way ANOVA was used for comparison between 2 groups and post-hoc multiple comparisons of means were performed by using Least Significant Difference. (1) The total cell counts and cell differentials in the BALF of subgroups B1, B2 and B4 were higher than those of subgroups A1, A2 and A4. The total cell counts and eosinophils (EOS) in the BALF of subgroups C1, C2, and C4 [Total cells (48 +/- 6) x 10(5), (51 +/- 9) x 10(5), (57 +/- 12) x 10(5); EOS (2.5 +/- 0.5) x 10(5), (2.7 +/- 0.6) x 10(5), (2.6 +/- 0.5) x 10(5), respectively] decreased significantly as compared to those of subgroups B1, B2 and B4 [Total cells (70 +/- 10) x 10(5), (88 +/- 8) x 10(5), (72 +/- 10) x 10(5); EOS (5.6 +/- 0.8) x 10(5), (6.6 +/- 0.6) x 10(5), (4.3 +/- 0.4) x 10(5)], all P < 0.05. There was no significant difference in the counts of neutrophils and lymphocytes in BALF between the treatment groups and the asthmatic groups. The count of epithelial cells in group C1 [(2.5 +/- 0.5) x 10(5)] was lower than that in group B1[(4.9 +/- 0.7) x 10(5)], q = 4.671, P < 0.05. But that in group C4[(5.7 +/- 1.2) x 10(5)] was higher than that in group B4 [(4.3 +/- 0.4) x 10(5)], q = 4.012, P < 0.05. (2) The airway inflammation score in group C4(3.6 +/- 0.6) was less than that in group B4(5.1 +/- 0.6), q = 4.923, P < 0.05. The scores of group C1 and C2 were less than those of group B1 and B2, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. (3) The expression of EGFR and tyrosine phosphorylation in airway epithelium of the OVA sensitized subgroups were increased statistically as compared to the control subgroups (all P < 0.05). Genistein decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR in subgroups C1, C2 and C4[(3.12 +/- 0.24), (3.00 +/- 0.28), (2.69 +/- 0.54)] as compared to subgroups B1, B2 and B4[(3.69 +/- 0.43), (3.57 +/- 0.29), (4.46 +/- 0.47), respectively] (all P < 0.05). (4) There were positive correlations between expression and activation of EGFR in airway epithelium and total cell counts, EOS counts, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts in BALF, and airway inflammation scores (all P < 0.05). EGFR is involved in airway inflammation of asthmatic rats. Tyrosine kinase inhibitor Genistein inhibits acute and chronic airway inflammation in the asthmatic model.

[Interrelations of cancer of hormone dependent tissues and other non-infectious diseases: aging aspect]. The group of main noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) includes cardio- and cerebrovascular pathology, cancer, chronic nonspecific respiratory states, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, unipolar depression, obesity, etc. Tumors of hormone dependent tissues compose about 35-45% of the whole cancer morbidity. The attempts to understand place of these tumors among other NCDs and analyze their interrelationships with regard to age and aging represent a vital task of contemporary oncoendocrinology. On the ground of accumulated data one can conclude that although principal NCDs are diagnosed mainly in the course of second half of human life, the maturing of their hormonal and metabolic bases is extended in time, rather often starts several decades before clinical appearance and demonstrates diverse character of the associations with different constituents of this group of diseases. As a result it may give rise for the absence of parallelism in age-specific incidence of several main NCDs, especially at concluding stages of ontogenesis.

Discovery of short pseudogenes derived from messenger RNAs. More than 40% of the human genome is generated by retrotransposition, a series of in vivo processes involving reverse transcription of RNA molecules and integration of the transcripts into the genomic sequence. The mechanism of retrotransposition, however, is not fully understood, and additional genomic elements generated by retrotransposition may remain to be discovered. Here, we report that the human genome contains many previously unidentified short pseudogenes generated by retrotransposition of mRNAs. Genomic elements generated by non-long terminal repeat retrotransposition have specific sequence signatures: a poly-A tract that is immediately downstream and a pair of duplicated sequences, called target site duplications (TSDs), at either end. Using a new computer program, TSDscan, that can accurately detect pseudogenes based on the presence of the poly-A tract and TSDs, we found 654 short (< or = 300 bp), previously unknown pseudogenes derived from mRNAs. Comprehensive analyses of the pseudogenes that we identified and their parent mRNAs revealed that the pseudogene length depends on the parent mRNA length: long mRNAs generate more short pseudogenes than do short mRNAs. To explain this phenomenon, we hypothesize that most long mRNAs are truncated before they are reverse transcribed. Truncated mRNAs would be rapidly degraded during reverse transcription, resulting in the generation of short pseudogenes.

Inflammatory biomarker profiling in elderly patients with acute hip fracture treated with heparins. Hip fracture is common in the elderly patients with associated high risk of venous thromboembolic complications. Pathogenic activation results in the generation of various surrogate markers in plasma. This study is designed to identify unique biomarkers in elderly patients with hip fracture using protein chip array enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods. Plasma from a randomized hip fracture study (PK-532; n = 341) treated with either enoxaparin (40 mg once daily) or unfractionated heparin (UFH; 5000 IU twice daily) were collected prior to and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days. A total of 52 samples were analyzed using proteomic surface-enhanced laser desorption/ ionization-time of flight (SELDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify unique biomarkers in the molecular weight range of 0 to 150 kd. Twenty-nine healthy volunteer's and pooled plasma from total hip replacement/total knee replacement patients with a unique biomarker at 11.9 kd were used as quality controls. In the 29 healthy individuals, the biomarker profile did not reveal the presence of any unique peak in comparison to the reference normal human plasma (NHP). Plasma obtained prior to surgery exhibits unique biomarkers in 4 of 52 (7.6%) of the samples. On day 1 postoperatively, 41 of 51 (80.3%) showed a distinct peak at 11.9 kd. On day 3, 43 of 49 (87.8%) patients showed the presence of this biomarker most often at its strongest intensity. In all, 22 of 44 (50%) showed this biomarker on day 5 and 4 of 23 (17.9%) on day 7. C-reactive protein (CRP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and serum amyloid A were also increased after surgery. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) antigen levels were increased due to the treatment modalities.

Overall survival benefit for weekly vs. three-weekly taxanes regimens in advanced breast cancer: A meta-analysis. Taxanes have been extensively tested in patients with advanced breast cancer, but it is unclear whether their weekly use might offer any benefits against standard every three weeks administration. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials that compared weekly and every three weeks taxanes regimens in advanced breast cancer. The endpoints that we assessed were objective response rate, progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival. Efficacy data for paclitaxel and docetaxel were separately analyzed. Trials were located through PubMed and Cochrane Library searches and abstracts of major international conferences. Omicronbjective response rate was notably better when paclitaxel was used as every three weeks regimen (7 studies, 1772 patients, fixed effect model pooled RR 1.20 95%CI 1.08-1.32 p<0.001). No difference were found for PFS (6 studies, 1610 patients, random effect model HR 1.02, 95%CI 0.81-1.30 p=0.860); while OS was statistically higher among patients receiving weekly paclitaxel (5 studies, 1471 patients, fixed effect model pooled HR 0.78, 95%CI 0.67-0.89 p=0.001). No differences were observed for the weekly compared to the every three weeks use of docetaxel either for objective response, PFS and OS. Overall, the incidence of serious adverse events, neutropenia, neutropenic fever, and peripheral neuropathy were significantly lower in weekly taxanes schedules. The incidence of nail changes and epiphora were significantly lower in the every three weeks docetaxel regimens. Use of paclitaxel in weekly regimen give overall survival advantages compared with the standard every three weeks regimen. The observed survival benefit does not seem to stem from an increased potency of the drug with weekly regimens. The use of weekly paclitaxel regimens is therefore recommended for the treatment of locally advanced/metastatic breast cancer.

[Clinical and economical evaluation of bivalirudin during percutaneous coronary interventions]. Bivalirudin, with provisional GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor use allows the same protection against ischemic complications while reducing the hemorrhagic complications compared with the systematic association of a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor plus heparin (The Randomized Evaluation in PCI Linking Angiomax to Reduced Clinical Events-2 [Replace-2]). In clinical practice, the use of heparin is not systematically associated with a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor. That's why we studied the clinical and economic interest of bivalirudin only versus heparin (UFH) only. Opened pragmatic monocentric study carried out in 2007. We made a chronological matching: for each patient treated with bivalirudin, we included the next patient with the same clinical presentation treated with unfractionated heparin. Ninety-two patients were included (46 in each group). The need for a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor during the PCI was not significantly different between the two groups (p=0.11). No major hemorrhagic complications were observed in the two groups. Prevalence of ecchymosis was not significantly different: 22 % in the UFH group versus 13 % in the bivalirudin group (p=0.27). The average troponin level the next day was significantly higher in the bivalirudin group (p=0,049), although the change in troponin levels before and after the procedure was similar in the two groups. The average cost by patient of anticoagulation by bivalirudin and HNF is very different, respectively 473+/-150 and 51+/-146 euro (p=0.0001). Bivalirudin can be an interesting alternative for patients with a high risk of having complications. But considering its cost this therapy must be used only for selected patients.

Immunophenotype and molecular characterisation of adenocarcinoma of the small intestine. Despite having a dramatically larger surface area than the large intestine, the small intestine is an infrequent site for the development of adenocarcinoma. To better understand the molecular abnormalities in small bowel adenocarcinoma (SBA), we characterised a number of candidate oncogenic pathways and the immunophenotype of this rare cancer. Tissue microarrays were constructed from tumour samples from 54 patients with all stages of the disease. Immunohistochemistry and microsatellite instability (MSI) testing were conducted. The profile of cytokeratin 20 and 7 coexpression was variable, but expression of caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2) was present in 70% of cases. In this young population (median age 54 years), loss of mismatch repair (MMR) proteins occurred in 35% of patients, with confirmed MSI in 100% of tested cases. Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was common, occurring in 96 and 71% of patients, respectively. Only one case showed HER2 expression and none showed loss of phosphatase and tensin homologue mutated on chromosome 10 (PTEN). These results suggest that alterations in DNA MMR pathways are common in SBAs, similar to what is observed in large bowel adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, the high percentage of tumours expressing both EGFR and VEGF suggests that patients with this rare cancer may benefit from therapeutic strategies targeting EGFR and VEGF receptor (VEGFR).


Early problematic eating behaviours are associated with lower fruit and vegetable intake and less dietary variety at 4-5 years of age. A prospective analysis of three European birth cohorts.

Molecular, physiological and morphological analysis of waterlogging tolerance in clonal genotypes of Theobroma cacao L. In soil, anoxia conditions generated by waterlogging induce changes in genetic, morphological and physiological processes, altering the growth and development of plants. Mass propagation of cacao (Theobroma cacao L.) plantlets (clones) is affected by waterlogging caused by heavy rains and irrigation methods used to induce rooting. An experiment was undertaken to assess the effects of a 45-day flooding (anoxia) on physiological and morphological traits of 35 elite cacao genotypes, aiming at potentially identifying those with greater tolerance to flooding of the growth substrate. Eighteen fluorochrome-labeled microsatellite (SSR) primer pairs were used to assess genetic variability among clones, with 248 alleles being amplified and used to calculate similarity coefficients. The resulting dendrogram indicated the presence of four major groups, in which two represented 60% and 31% of the genotypes tested. A general trend toward high levels of heterozygosity was also found for physiological and morphological traits. The survival index (IS) for flood tolerance observed varied from 30 to 96%. Clones TSA-654, TSA-656, TSA-792, CA-1.4, CEPEC-2009 and PH-17 showed an IS value above 94%, whereas CEPEC-2010, CEPEC-2002, CA-7.1 and VB-903 clones were those mostly affected by waterlogging, with IS value below 56%. All genotypes displayed lenticel and adventitious root formation in response to waterlogging, although with different intensities. To determine whether patterns of physiological response could be associated with tolerance to anoxia, a similarity-grouping analysis was performed using the ratio between waterlogged and control values obtained for a series of physiological variables assessed. No specific pattern of physiological and morphological responses to waterlogging was strictly associated with survival of plantlets. However, results revealed by the dendrogram suggest that absence of leaf chlorosis may be a proper trait to indicate cacao clones with higher survival rates under flooding conditions. Consequences of these findings are discussed in the context of developing improved strategies for mass production of clones from elite cacao genotypes.

Linking human diseases to animal models using ontology-based phenotype annotation. Scientists and clinicians who study genetic alterations and disease have traditionally described phenotypes in natural language. The considerable variation in these free-text descriptions has posed a hindrance to the important task of identifying candidate genes and models for human diseases and indicates the need for a computationally tractable method to mine data resources for mutant phenotypes. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that ontological annotation of disease phenotypes will facilitate the discovery of new genotype-phenotype relationships within and across species. To describe phenotypes using ontologies, we used an Entity-Quality (EQ) methodology, wherein the affected entity (E) and how it is affected (Q) are recorded using terms from a variety of ontologies. Using this EQ method, we annotated the phenotypes of 11 gene-linked human diseases described in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM). These human annotations were loaded into our Ontology-Based Database (OBD) along with other ontology-based phenotype descriptions of mutants from various model organism databases. Phenotypes recorded with this EQ method can be computationally compared based on the hierarchy of terms in the ontologies and the frequency of annotation. We utilized four similarity metrics to compare phenotypes and developed an ontology of homologous and analogous anatomical structures to compare phenotypes between species. Using these tools, we demonstrate that we can identify, through the similarity of the recorded phenotypes, other alleles of the same gene, other members of a signaling pathway, and orthologous genes and pathway members across species. We conclude that EQ-based annotation of phenotypes, in conjunction with a cross-species ontology, and a variety of similarity metrics can identify biologically meaningful similarities between genes by comparing phenotypes alone. This annotation and search method provides a novel and efficient means to identify gene candidates and animal models of human disease, which may shorten the lengthy path to identification and understanding of the genetic basis of human disease.

A novel, drug-based, cellular assay for the activity of neurotoxic mutants of the prion protein.

Neural correlates of inhibitory deficits in depression. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine neural correlates of inhibitory dysfunction in individuals diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD). Twelve MDD participants and 12 never-depressed controls completed the negative affective priming (NAP) task in the scanner. Results indicated that, in depressed participants, increased activation in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) is associated with inhibition of negative, but not positive, words; in contrast, in nondepressed participants, inhibition of positive, but not negative, words is associated with increased activation in the rACC. These findings indicate that abnormalities in neural function, especially in the rACC, may underlie difficulties experienced by depressed individuals in inhibiting negative thoughts. These results underscore the importance of continuing to examine the relation between cognitive and neural functioning in depression in order to gain a broader and more integrative understanding of this disorder.

Clinical and molecular characterization of a re-established line of sheep exhibiting hemophilia A.

Discovery and characterization of tRNAIle lysidine synthetase (TilS). In the bacterial decoding system, the AUA codon is deciphered as isoleucine by tRNA(Ile) bearing lysidine (L, 2-lysyl-cytidine) at the wobble position. Lysidine is an essential modification that determines both the codon and amino acid specificities of tRNA(Ile). We identified an enzyme named tRNA(Ile) lysidine synthetase (TilS) that catalyzes lysidine formation by using lysine and ATP as substrates. Biochemical studies revealed a molecular mechanism of lysidine formation that consists of two consecutive reactions involving the adenylated tRNA intermediate. In addition, we deciphered how Escherichia coli TilS specifically discriminates between tRNA(Ile) and the structurally similar tRNA(Met), which bears the same anticodon loop. Recent structural studies unveiled tRNA recognition by TilS, and a molecular basis of lysidine formation at atomic resolution.

Comparative study on characteristics of azo dye decolorization by indigenous decolorizers. This study provides a first attempt to explore indigenous strains with excellent decolorization capability from the most biodiverse region in Taiwan for dye-bearing wastewater treatment. Bacterial isolates were obtained via serial selections under selection pressure of the fungicide nystatin and model textile dye(s). According to profiles of protein expression and PCR-augmented 16S rRNA gene analyses for strain identification, >99% of nucleotide sequences in isolated strains were identical to type strains Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cancerogenus, Proteus hauseri, Acinetobacter johnsonii. This first-attempt study not only explored most abundant decolorizers in Taiwan, but also compared their color removal performance for further applications.

[Do Capsicum spp. trichomes influence the biological aspects of the broad mite, Polyphagotarsonemus latus Banks (Acari: Tarsonemidae)?]. Plant morphology traits can affect the feeding preference, oviposition choice and the vulnerability of herbivores to natural enemies. At long term, these plant variations may influence herbivore population dynamics due to the interference on their development, survival and reproduction. In this paper, the development of the broad mite Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks) was evaluated on five species of Capsicum with different density of trichomes. We tested the hypothesis that P. latus population growth has a negative relationship with the increase trichome density on leaves. It was assessed a decrease in the intrinsic growth rate (r m) of P. latus with the increase of trichome density on the leaves tested. The lower r m was measured in leaves of C. praetermissum (r m = 0.46), which has the highest trichome density among the assessed Capsicum species. The highest values of r m were observed on Capsicum species with intermediate densities of trichomes on leaves such as Capsicum frutescens (r m = 0.77) and Capsicum chinense (r m = 0.76). Capsicum spp. trichomes acted as a limiting plant trait for the development of P. latus when they were in higher densities and better distributed on the leaf surface. We also discuss the role of morphologic and chemical plant defenses on P. latus development.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome after treatment with azithromycin: an uncommon culprit. Azithromycin is a commonly prescribed antibiotic but is not considered a common etiologic agent for Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). SJS is a dermatologic emergency that occurs within a spectrum of severity and can result in severe morbidity and mortality.

SORTEO: Monte Carlo-based simulator with list-mode capabilities. Monte Carlo-based PET simulators are powerful tools in the evaluation and validation of new PET algorithms. Accurate generation of projection data from spatiotemporal tracer distributions enable, for a given scanner specification and attenuating media distribution, quantitative analysis based on known ground truth. High activity-related phenomena, such as the contribution of randoms, as well as block and system deadtimes, corrupt actual PET scan data and therefore must be integrated within the simulation model, along with photon interactions within tissue and scanner materials. The PET-SORTEO Monte Carlo simulator, dedicated to full ring tomographs, is able to generate scattered, unscattered, and randoms event distributions from voxelized phantoms, accounting for data losses due to system deadtime. We show the results of extending the simulator to include accurate generation of list-mode data. Our implementation avoids incorrect event distribution and event timing inaccuracies cause by local and propagating temporal rounding errors. List-mode events produced by the PET-SORTEO simulator, when rebinned, are now consistent with sinograms produced by the simulator.

Efficacy of surface charge in targeting pegylated nanoparticles of sulpiride to the brain.

The effects of a self-esteem program incorporated into health and physical education classes. Self-esteem, a key construct of personality, influences thoughts, actions, and feelings. Adolescence is a critical stage to the development of self-esteem. Taiwan currently offers no self-esteem building curriculum in the public education system. Therefore, incorporating self-esteem-related teaching activities into the existing curriculum represents a feasible approach to enhance self-esteem in middle school students. This study aimed to explore the effects on junior high school students' self-esteem of a self-esteem program incorporated into the general health and physical education curriculum. A quasi-experimental research design was used, and 184 seventh-grade students at two junior high schools in Taipei City were randomly selected and separated into two groups. The experimental group received one 32-week self-esteem program incorporated into their regular health and physical education curriculum, which was administered in three 45-minute-session classes each week. The control group received the regular health and physical education with no specially designed elements. During the week before the intervention began and the week after its conclusion, each participant's global and academic, physical, social, and family self-esteem was assessed. Data were analyzed using analysis of covariance. For all participants, the experimental group was significantly superior to the control group in respect to physical self-esteem (p = .02). For girls, the experimental group was significantly superior to the control group in family self-esteem (p = .02). However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of global self-esteem. This study provides preliminary evidence that incorporating self-esteem activities into the regular school health and physical education curriculum can result in minor effects in students' physical self-esteem and family self-esteem. Findings may provide teachers and school administrators with information to help them design programs to improve students' self-esteem. This study also reminds health professionals to focus on providing self-esteem-building programs when working with adolescent clients.

[The pleiotropic activity of heat-shock proteins]. Stress or heat-shock proteins (HSPs) are highly conserved proteins present in cells of both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, providing them with protection from cellular and environmental stress factors.Based on molecular-weight, HSPs can be divided into the large (HSP100: 100-110 kDa and HSP90: 75-96 kDa), intermediate (HSP70: 66-78 kDa, HSP60, and HSP40), and small (sHSP:8.5-40 kDa) subfamilies. These proteins play an essential role as molecular chaperones/co-chaperones by assisting the correct folding of nascent and stress-accumulated protein-substrate assembly,preventing the aggregation of these proteins, as well as transport across membranes and the degradation of other proteins. Members of HSP family display dual activity depending on the irintra- or extracellular distribution. Intracellular HSPs mainly play a protective role. Extracellular or membrane-bound HSPs mediate immunological functions. Among the functions of HSPs is their participation in cell signaling. This review deals with the structure and properties of the main members of the HSPs and their role in a large number of cellular/extracellular processes.

SM50 repeat-polypeptides self-assemble into discrete matrix subunits and promote appositional calcium carbonate crystal growth during sea urchin tooth biomineralization. The two major proteins involved in vertebrate enamel formation and echinoderm sea urchin tooth biomineralization, amelogenin and SM50, are both characterized by elongated polyproline repeat domains in the center of the macromolecule. To determine the role of polyproline repeat polypeptides in basal deuterostome biomineralization, we have mapped the localization of SM50 as it relates to crystal growth, conducted self-assembly studies of SM50 repeat polypeptides, and examined their effect on calcium carbonate and apatite crystal growth. Electron micrographs of the growth zone of Strongylocentrotus purpuratus sea urchin teeth documented a series of successive events from intravesicular mineral nucleation to mineral deposition at the interface between tooth surface and odontoblast syncytium. Using immunohistochemistry, SM50 was detected within the cytoplasm of cells associated with the developing tooth mineral, at the mineral secreting front, and adjacent to initial mineral deposits, but not in muscles and ligaments. Polypeptides derived from the SM50 polyproline alternating hexa- and hepta-peptide repeat region (SM50P6P7) formed highly discrete, donut-shaped self-assembly patterns. In calcium carbonate crystal growth studies, SM50P6P7 repeat peptides triggered the growth of expansive networks of fused calcium carbonate crystals while in apatite growth studies, SM50P6P7 peptides facilitated the growth of needle-shaped and parallel arranged crystals resembling those found in developing vertebrate enamel. In comparison, SM50P6P7 surpassed the PXX24 polypeptide repeat region derived from the vertebrate enamel protein amelogenin in its ability to promote crystal nucleation and appositional crystal growth. Together, these studies establish the SM50P6P7 polyproline repeat region as a potent regulator in the protein-guided appositional crystal growth that occurs during continuous tooth mineralization and eruption. In addition, our studies highlight the role of species-specific polyproline repeat motifs in the formation of discrete self-assembled matrices and the resulting control of mineral growth. 

Extracorporeal and intracorporeal lithotripsy of salivary gland stones: basic investigations. The traditional treatment for sialolithiasis was extirpation of the affected gland. It is now known, however, that salivary gland function can recover completely after stone extraction alone. Since the mid-1980s, much thought has been given to treating sialolithiasis with extracorporeal or intracorporeal shock waves in a manner similar to that used for urinary tract or biliary tract stones, and this has been implemented successfully. This article provides an overview of the various methods of extracorporeal and intracorporeal lithotripsy that have been used or proposed for salivary calculi to date, considering the advantages and disadvantages of each of the techniques.

Skin cooling aids cerebrovascular function more effectively under severe than moderate heat stress. Skin surface cooling has been shown to improve orthostatic tolerance; however, the influence of severe heat stress on cardiovascular and cerebrovascular responses to skin cooling remains unknown. Nine healthy males, resting supine in a water-perfusion suit, were heated to +1.0 and +2.0 degrees C elevation in body core temperature (T (c)). Blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (transcranial Doppler ultrasound), mean arterial pressure (MAP; photoplethysmography), stroke volume (SV; Modelflow), total peripheral resistance (TPR; Modelflow), heart rate (HR; ECG) and the partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (P(ET)CO(2)) were measured continuously during 1-min baseline and 3-min lower body negative pressure (LBNP, -15 mm Hg) when heated without and again with skin surface cooling. Nine participants tolerated +1 degrees C and six participants reached +2 degrees C. Skin cooling elevated (P = 0.004) MAP ~4% during baseline and LBNP at +1 degrees C T (c). During LBNP, skin cooling increased SV (9%; P = 0.010) and TPR (0.9 mm Hg L(-1) min, P = 0.013) and lowered HR (13 b min(-1), P = 0.012) at +1 degrees C T (c) and +2 degrees C T (c) collectively. At +2 degrees C T (c), skin cooling elevated P(ET)CO(2) ~4.3 mm Hg (P = 0.011) and therefore reduced cerebral vascular resistance ~0.1 mm Hg cm(-1) s at baseline and LBNP (P = 0.012). In conclusion, skin cooling under severe heating and mild orthostatic stress maintained cerebral blood flow more effectively than it did under moderate heating, in conjunction with elevated carbon dioxide pressure, SV and arterial resistance.

On the control of a robot hand by extracting neural signals from the PNS: preliminary results from a human implantation. The development of hybrid neuroprosthetic systems (HBSs) linking the human nervous system with artificial devices is an important area of research that is currently addressed by several groups to restore sensorimotor function in people affected by different disabilities. It is particularly important to establish a fast, intuitive, bidirectional flow of information between the nervous system of the user and the smart robotic device. Among the possible solutions to achieve this goal, interfaces with the peripheral nervous system and in particular intraneural electrodes can represent an interesting choice. In the present study, thin-film longitudinal intra-fascicular electrodes were implanted in the median and ulnar nerves of an amputee. The possibility of restoring the bidirectional link between the subject and the external world was investigated during a 4 week trial. The result showed that both the extraction of motor information and the restoration of sensory function are possible.

Effects of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol and soy isoflavones supplementation on bone mineralisation of quail. 1. The effects of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (25-OH-D(3)) and soy isoflavones supplementation on performance, carcase recovery, bone mineral density, and tibia ash, Ca, P, and serum vitamin D concentrations and alkaline phosphatase activity in the Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) exposed to high ambient temperature were evaluated. 2. A total of 270 ten-d-old Japanese quail were randomly assigned to 9 treatment groups, 6 replicates of 5 birds each in a 2 x 3 x 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. Birds were kept in a temperature-controlled room at either 22 degrees C (thermo-neutral) or 34 degrees C (heat stress) for 8 h/d (09:00-17:00 h) and given a basal (control) diet or the basal diet supplemented with one of three levels of 25-OH-D(3) (0, 250 and 500 IU/kg of diet) combined with one of three levels of soy isoflavones (0, 400 and 800 mg/kg of diet). 3. Birds kept at 34 degrees C consumed less feed and gained less weight than control birds. An increase in body weight, feed intake (and improvement in feed efficiency and carcase recovery were found in soy isoflavones and 25-OH-D(3)-supplemented quail reared under heat stress conditions. Bone mineral density, tibia ash, Ca, and P were linearly improved by 25-OH-D(3) and soy isoflavones supplementation in both thermoneutral and heat stress groups. Serum vitamin D levels and alkaline phosphatase activity were improved by 25-OH-D(3) and soy isoflavones supplementation in both thermoneutral and heat stress groups in quail. 4. In conclusion, a combination of 25-OH-D(3) and soy isoflavones supplementation to basal diet significantly improved bone mineralisation in quail.


Eosinophilic Esophagitis: A Comprehensive Review.

DNA structures from phosphate chemical shifts. For B-DNA, the strong linear correlation observed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) between the (31)P chemical shifts (deltaP) and three recurrent internucleotide distances demonstrates the tight coupling between phosphate motions and helicoidal parameters. It allows to translate deltaP into distance restraints directly exploitable in structural refinement. It even provides a new method for refining DNA oligomers with restraints exclusively inferred from deltaP. Combined with molecular dynamics in explicit solvent, these restraints lead to a structural and dynamical view of the DNA as detailed as that obtained with conventional and more extensive restraints. Tests with the Jun-Fos oligomer show that this deltaP-based strategy can provide a simple and straightforward method to capture DNA properties in solution, from routine NMR experiments on unlabeled samples.

The mobile phone decreases fructose but not citrate in rabbit semen: a longitudinal study. The negative impact of mobile phones on sperm motility has been previously described. Both fructose and citrate are important components in semen that facilitate sperm motility. To date, no studies have investigated the effect of exposure to electromagnetic radiation emitted from the mobile phone on their levels.. Therefore, a longitudinal study using the adult rabbit as a model was undertaken. A total of 30 adult male rabbits were randomly divided into three groups. The first (phone) group was placed in specially designed cages, and exposed to radio frequency emitted from a mobile phone (900 MHz) kept in standby mode and positioned adjacent to the genitalia for 8 h daily for 12 weeks. The other two groups served as controls; the stress group which was housed in the same kind of cages to evaluate any cage-induced anxiety, and the control group which was housed in the conventional roomy cages. Semen samples were retrieved weekly. Sperm motility and viability, semen fructose and citrate, and serum testosterone were measured. Histological sections from the prostatic complex, ampulla, and vesicular gland were evaluated. A significant drop in both fructose levels (257 +/-11.6 vs. 489 +/- 8.4 mg %, the baseline level) and number of motile sperms (50 vs. 72%) was observedin the phone group at the 10th week. However, no correlation was found between the two values. The stress control animals showed a similar but significantly less decline in motility No significant changes in citrate levels or other study parameters were seen in the three animal groups throughout the study. In conclusion, the pulsed radio frequency emitted by the mobile phone kept in the standby position longitudinally affected sperm motility and fructose but not citrate levels in rabbit semen.


Effect of mitral isthmus block on development of atrial tachycardia following ablation for atrial fibrillation.

[Pudendal block or combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia in high-dose-rate brachytherapy for prostate carcinoma?]. In male patients the pudendal block has been applied only in rare cases as a therapy for neuralgia of the pudendal nerve. Up to now there is no comparison of pudendal block with an anaesthesia form close to the spinal cord. In this pilot study the bilateral perineal infiltration of the pudendal nerve was compared to combined spinal-epidural anaesthesia in high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy. In 30 patients (68.8 +/- 5.4 years) who underwent a core needle biopsy for high-risk prostate carcinoma, an HDR brachytherapy in CSE or NPB was carried out. Both anaesthesia forms were examined concerning the perioperative compatibility, the subjective feeling (German school marks principle 1-6), the pain feeling (VAS, 1-10) and the early postoperative course (mobility, complications). Both anaesthesia procedures were offered to all patients. For 2 patients the NPB was favoured primarily, because they had undergone surgery of the lumbal spine, so that the CSE was not applicable. There was no change of anaesthesia form necessary. The expense of time for NPB was 10.5 +/- 2.5 min, for CSE 30.5 +/- 5.5 min (p < 0.005). The hollow needles remained in place on average for 79 +/- 11.7 min (p = 0.23). Inter- and postoperative pain feelings were in both groups between 1.3 +/- 1.1 and 1.1 +/- 1.0 (p = 0.61 and p = 0.29). The difference is not significant. The NPB group considered postoperative mobility as an advantage. All patients felt the bladder catheter as annoying, but the NPB group considered postoperative mobility as more important than complete lack of pain. The subjective feeling in the NPB group was described as 2.06 +/- 0.59 and in the CSE group 2.73 +/- 0.79. This is a significant difference (p < 0.005). No side effects or complications in both anaesthesia forms appeared. The perineal pudendal block is equivalent to epidural anaesthesia in HDR brachytherapy. Concerning the objectifiable pain score measurement and the subjective feeling there are no essential significant differences.

Amelioration of brain pathology and behavioral dysfunction in mice with lupus following treatment with a tolerogenic peptide. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is manifested by neurologic deficits and psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to examine SLE-associated CNS pathology in lupus-prone (NZBxNZW)F1 (NZB/NZW) mice, and to evaluate the ameliorating effects of treatment with a tolerogenic peptide, hCDR1 (human first complementarity-determining region), on these manifestations. Histopathologic analyses of brains from lupus-prone NZB/NZW mice treated with vehicle, hCDR1, or a control scrambled peptide were performed. The messenger RNA expression of SLE-associated cytokines and apoptosis-related molecules from the hippocampi was determined. Anxiety-like behavior was assessed by open-field tests and dark/light transfer tests, and memory deficit was assessed using a novel object recognition test. Infiltration was evident in the hippocampi of the lupus-afflicted mice, and the presence of CD3+ T cells as well as IgG and complement C3 complex deposition was observed. Furthermore, elevated levels of gliosis and loss of neuronal nuclei immunoreactivity were also observed in the hippocampi of the mice with lupus. Treatment with hCDR1 ameliorated the histopathologic changes. Treatment with hCDR1 down-regulated the high expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, IL-10, interferon-gamma, transforming growth factor beta, and the proapoptotic molecule caspase 8 in the hippocampi of the mice with lupus, and up-regulated expression of the antiapoptotic bcl-xL gene. Diseased mice exhibited increased anxiety-like behavior and memory deficit. Treatment with hCDR1 improved these parameters, as assessed by behavior tests. Treatment with hCDR1 ameliorated CNS pathology and improved the tested cognitive and mood-related behavior of the mice with lupus. Thus, hCDR1 is a novel candidate for the treatment of CNS lupus.


Early control of PTH and FGF23 in normophosphatemic CKD patients: a new target in CKD-MBD therapy?

Transformation potential of bone marrow stromal cells into undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma. Bone marrow adherent cells contain conventional bone marrow stromal cells and mesenchymal stem cells and these cells constitute the hematopoietic microenvironment. Mesenchymal stem cells have the capacity to give rise to multiple mesenchymal lineage cells and even ectodermal lineage cells. In the present study, we investigated what types of tumor cells are inducible from BM adherent cells by chemical carcinogens. Bone marrow cells from neonatal C3H/HeN mice were collected within 24 h after birth and then cultured. Four days later, bone marrow adherent cells were obtained and the cells were treated with 3-methylcholanthrene. By this treatment, some transformed clones consisting of large spindle cells were obtained. The transformed cells were highly positive for CD44 and were positive for Sca-1, CD49d and CD106, whereas the cells were negative for hematolymphoid markers. The cell clones had the ability to support hematopoiesis in vitro. These results indicate that the transformed cell lines have the characteristics of BM stromal cells/mesenchymal stem cells. Moreover, during culture of the transformed cells, spontaneous bone nodule formation was observed. When the transformed cells were inoculated into immunodeficient mice subcutaneously, the neoplasms grew in the subcutaneous tissue of the mice. Microscopically and ultrastructurally, the neoplasms showed the typical morphology of undifferentiated high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma (UHGPS). Bone-related genes have been found to be expressed in both transformed cells and UHGPSs. The present study suggests that UHGPSs are derived from BM stromal cells, probably mesenchymal stem cells.

Preoperative biliary drainage for distal obstruction: the case against revisited. No conclusive evidence exists confirming the role of preoperative biliary drainage (PBD) in reversing the physiological disturbances resulting from biliary obstruction to improve outcome. This review examined the impact of PBD and the outcomes after surgery. A PubMed literature search was undertaken using the keywords preoperative, biliary, and drainage. The primary end points were the effect of PBD on mortality, morbidity, and bile cultures. The secondary outcome measures were PBD and pancreatic leakage, intra-abdominal abscess, sepsis/infectious complications, wound infection, hemorrhage, and bile leak rates. The impact of bile cultures positive for bacteria and the outcomes after surgery were also examined. Preoperative biliary drainage significantly increases wound and bile infection rates on meta-analysis (P < 0.0005) using a fixed and random effect model, but no adverse effect on mortality and morbidity was found. A bile culture positive for bacteria negatively impacts on both mortality and morbidity (P < 0.005) after surgery. Preoperative biliary drainage significantly increases the rates of bile culture positive for bacteria and the probability of wound infection. Bile cultures positive for bacteria adversely impact mortality and morbidity after surgery in jaundiced patients. Although no evidence has been found by this review that PBD directly increases mortality and morbidity, it is possible that in certain patients, PBD may deleteriously affect outcome by bacterial contamination of the bile.

Determinants of Utilization of Health Extension Workers in the Context of Scale-Up of Integrated Community Case Management of Childhood Illnesses in Ethiopia. Ethiopia has invested significant resources in integrated community case management (iCCM) of childhood illness. In Oromia Region, iCCM scale-up was phased in, allowing for comparisons between districts providing iCCM and routine services. We assessed the determinants of utilization of health extension workers (HEWs) delivering iCCM services at rural health posts by caregivers of sick, under-five children in a cross-sectional survey. We found low utilization of HEWs with only 9.3% of caregivers of a child sick with diarrhea, fever, and/or pneumonia in the previous 2 weeks taking their child to HEWs in both iCCM and routine areas. There was a higher likelihood of utilization of HEWs in iCCM areas (OR: 1.44; 95% CI: 0.97-2.12; P = 0.07), but this effect disappeared after accounting for confounders. In iCCM areas, maternal education, illness type, and distance were associated with utilization. Perceptions of illness severity and service quality were the primary reasons given for not utilizing the health post. Our findings suggest that though iCCM is reaching some vulnerable populations, there remain significant barriers to use of HEWs delivering iCCM services. Efforts for demand generation and minimization of remaining barriers are urgently needed for the sustained success of the iCCM strategy in Ethiopia.

Age differences in attachment orientations among younger and older adults: evidence from two self-report measures of attachment. The attachment patterns of younger and older adults were studied using two-dimensional self-report measures of adult attachment. Community-dwelling younger (n = 144, M = 22.5 years, SD = 3.6) and older (n = 106, M = 68.6 years, SD = 8.3) adults completed the Measure of Attachment Qualities (MAQ; Carver, 1997) and the Relationship Style Questionnaire (RSQ; Griffin & Bartholomew, 1994). Although the MAQ and RSQ are believed to be measuring similar constructs, they are derived from different theoretical perspectives. Correlations between the two measures were in the expected directions proving modest evidence for their convergent validity. Regarding cross-sectional results, as was expected, older adults scored lower than younger adults on the ambivalent-worry attachment scale of the MAQ and the preoccupied attachment scale of the RSQ. There were no age differences regarding secure, avoidant, and dismissing attachment. It appears that older adults experience anxious types of attachment less frequently than younger adults. Although these results primarily speak to age differences and possible cohort effects, they also provide some support for socioemotional selectivity theory and its hypothesized improved relationships in later life.

Restoration of cerebral vascular relaxation in renin congenic rats by introgression of the Dahl R renin gene. This study determined whether transfer of the renin gene from the Dahl salt-resistant (Dahl R) strain into the Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) genetic background restores the relaxation of middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) to different vasodilator stimuli in S/renRR renin congenic (SS.SR-(D13N1 and Syt2)/Mcwi) (RGRR) rats maintained on low-salt (0.4% NaCl) diet. Responses to vasodilator stimuli were evaluated in isolated MCA from SS (Dahl SS/Jr/Hsd/MCWi), RGRR rats, and Dahl R rats. MCA from SS rats failed to dilate in response to acetylcholine (ACh; 10(-6) mol/l), hypoxia (PO2 reduction to 40-45 mm Hg), and iloprost (10(-11) g/ml). ACh- and hypoxia-induced dilations were present in Dahl R rats and restored in RGRR rats. MCA from RGRR and SS constricted in response to iloprost, whereas MCA from Dahl R rats dilated in response to iloprost. MCA from SS, RGRR, and Dahl R rats exhibited similar dilations in response to cholera toxin (10(-9) g/ml) and dialated in response to the nitric oxide (NO) donor DEA-NONOate (10(-5) mol/l). (i) Restoration of normal regulation of the renin-angiotensin system restores dilations to ACh and hypoxia that are impaired in SS rats, (ii) prostacyclin signaling is impaired in SS and RGRR rats but intact in Dahl R rats, indicating that alleles other than the renin gene affect vascular relaxation in response to this agonist; and (iii) vascular smooth muscle sensitivity to NO is preserved in SS and RGRR and is not responsible for impaired arterial relaxation in response to ACh in SS rats.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma presenting as low back pain: diagnosed by bone scan coordinating with F-18 FDG PET/CT. Case report. We report malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) discovered in a Tc-99m MDP bone scan as a photopenic lesion in a 64-year-old man presenting with low back pain and diagnosed with F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). Malignant pleural mesothelioma, an uncommon neoplasm with a poor prognosis, arises from mesothelial cells of the pleura. Typically, the patient presents with either chest pain or symptoms derived from a pleural effusion such as dyspnea, or both. Most cases of MPM are initially detected on chest radiographs and primarily diagnosed with a CT scan. Case study with bone scan and F-18 FDG PET/CT. The Tc-99m MDP bone scan showed a photopenic defect occupying the left side of the T11 vertebra and implicated the existence of a tumor. Pathologic analysis of the paraspinal tumor indicated metastatic neoplastic cells, which we initially suspected originated from the gastrointestinal tract. The CT and magnetic resonance imaging showed no additional information about the primary malignancy; therefore, we did an F-18 FDG PET/CT study, which suggested malignant pleural mesothelioma. The present case highlights both the value of a Tc-99m MDP bone scan when MPM presents, unusually, as low back pain, and the importance of carefully interpreting bone scan images, especially for photopenic defects. It also indicates the usefulness of F-18 FDG PET/CT study in MPM in a difficult histopathological diagnosis.


Evaluation of recent advances in continuous film coating processes.

Plant mitochondrial RNA editing: the Strasbourg chapter. For 8 years, it was not understood why certain genes of plant mitochondria contain CGG (arginine) codons at positions where tryptophan codons (UGG) are present in the corresponding genes of nonplant species. Identification and sequencing of a tRNA(Trp) gene showed that it is not able to decode the CGG codon. Analysis of different discrepancies in the sequences of plant mitochondrial proteins prompted us to determine directly the corresponding RNA sequences. These experiments showed that plant mitochondrial transcripts are subject to RNA editing that changes C into U, resulting in a better phylogenetic conservation of protein sequences [Gualberto et al. (1989) Nature 341, 660-662].

Rickettsia slovaca and Rickettsia raoultii in Dermacentor marginatus ticks collected on wild boars in Tuscany, Italy. During the hunting season 2007-2008, 494 Dermacentor marginatus (Sulzer) ticks were collected from 109 hunter-killed wild boars, Sus scrofa, in Lucca's province, Tuscany, Italy. Rickettsia slovaca, the causative agent of tick-borne lymphadenopathy (TIBOLA), was detected in 32.1% of ticks tested (n=112) by using polymerase chain reaction primers targeting gltA, ompA, and ompB rickettsial genes. Moreover, Rickettsia raoultii was found for the first time in Italy, with 1.8% infection prevalence. This study confirms the risk posed to humans by ticks and tick-borne pathogens in the study area, where cases of spotted fever rickettsiosis (TIBOLA) are reported.

Thiopurine S-methyltransferase pharmacogenetics: functional characterization of a novel rapidly degraded variant allozyme. A novel human thiopurine S-methyltransferase (TPMT) variant allele, (319 T>G, 107Tyr>Asp, *27), was identified in a Thai renal transplantation recipient with reduced erythrocyte TPMT activity. The TPMT*27 variant allozyme showed a striking decrease in both immunoreactive protein level and enzyme activity after transient expression in a mammalian cell line. We set out to explore the mechanism(s) responsible for decreased expression of this novel variant of an important drug-metabolizing enzyme. We observed accelerated degradation of TPMT*27 protein in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate. TPMT*27 degradation was slowed by proteasome inhibition and involved chaperone proteins-similar to observations with regard to the degradation of the common TPMT*3A variant allozyme. TPMT*27 aggresome formation was also observed in transfected mammalian cells after proteasome inhibition. Inhibition of autophagy also decreased TPMT*27 degradation. Finally, structural analysis and molecular dynamics simulation indicated that TPMT*27 was less stable than was the wild type TPMT allozyme. In summary, TPMT*27 serves to illustrate the potential importance of protein degradation - both proteasome and autophagy-mediated degradation - for the pharmacogenetic effects of nonsynonymous SNPs.

Choice in multi-alternative environments: a trial-by-trial implementation of the sequential choice model. The sequential choice model (SCM) proposes that latencies to accept options presented alone can be used to predict preferences between these options when they are presented simultaneously. SCM has been proposed and tested in experiments where only two alternatives were present. To further challenge the model, we trained and tested European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in an environment with a background of four alternatives differing in delay to reinforcement. Unexpected binary choices between the six possible pairs of alternatives were used to assess preference. The model's predictions of the strength of preference roughly corresponded to the bird's choices for each of the six choice situations. More importantly, a trial-by-trial test of the model correctly predicted 84% of all individual choice trials.

The macrophage: the intersection between HIV infection and atherosclerosis. HIV-infected individuals are at increased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) with underlying mechanisms including chronic immune activation and inflammation secondary to HIV-induced microbial translocation and low-grade endotoxemia; direct effects of HIV and viral proteins on macrophage cholesterol metabolism; and dyslipidemia related to HIV infection and specific antiretroviral therapies. Monocytes are the precursors of the lipid-laden foam cells within the atherosclerotic plaque and produce high levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. The minor CD14+/CD16+ "proinflammatory" monocyte subpopulation is preferentially susceptible to HIV infection and may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of HIV-related CAD. In this review, the central role of monocytes/macrophages in HIV-related CAD and the importance of inflammation and cholesterol metabolism are discussed.

Imaging findings of thoracic low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma: report of three cases.

Posttranslational control of transcription factor FixK2, a key regulator for the Bradyrhizobium japonicum-soybean symbiosis. Rhizobial FixK-like proteins play essential roles in activating genes for endosymbiotic life in legume root nodules, such as genes for micro-oxic respiration. In the facultative soybean symbiont, Bradyrhizobium japonicum, the FixK(2) protein is the key player in a complex regulatory network. The fixK(2) gene itself is activated by the 2-component regulatory system FixLJ in response to a moderate decrease of the oxygen tension, and the FixK(2) protein distributes and amplifies this response to the level of approximately 200 target genes. Unlike other members of the cAMP receptor protein family, to which FixK(2) belongs, the FixK(2) protein does not appear to be modulated by small effector molecules. Here, we show that a critical, single cysteine residue (C183) near the DNA-binding domain of FixK(2) confers sensitivity to oxidizing agents and reactive oxygen species. Oxidation-dependent inactivation occurs not only in vitro, as shown with cell-free transcription assays, but also in vivo, as shown by microarray-assisted transcriptome analysis of the FixK(2) regulon. The oxidation mechanism may involve a reversible dimerization by intermolecular disulfide-bridge formation and a direct, irreversible oxidation at the cysteine thiol, depending on the oxidizing agent. Mutational exchange of C183 to alanine renders FixK(2) resistant to oxidation, yet allows full activity, shown again both in vitro and in vivo. We hypothesize that posttranslational modification by reactive oxygen species is a means to counterbalance the cellular pool of active FixK(2), which would otherwise fill unrestrictedly through FixLJ-dependent synthesis.

The extracellular matrix: not just pretty fibrils. The extracellular matrix (ECM) and ECM proteins are important in phenomena as diverse as developmental patterning, stem cell niches, cancer, and genetic diseases. The ECM has many effects beyond providing structural support. ECM proteins typically include multiple, independently folded domains whose sequences and arrangement are highly conserved. Some of these domains bind adhesion receptors such as integrins that mediate cell-matrix adhesion and also transduce signals into cells. However, ECM proteins also bind soluble growth factors and regulate their distribution, activation, and presentation to cells. As organized, solid-phase ligands, ECM proteins can integrate complex, multivalent signals to cells in a spatially patterned and regulated fashion. These properties need to be incorporated into considerations of the functions of the ECM.

Effects of in vitro exposure to natural levels of zearalenone and its derivatives on chromatin structure stability in equine spermatozoa. The purpose of this study was to assess the natural exposure of male horses (Equus caballus) to the mycotoxin zearalenone (ZEA) by using the ELISA test and to evaluate the effects of in vitro exposure of sperm cells to mycotoxin-containing urine extracts on sperm chromatin structure stability. Because of their occurrence in urine samples, ZEA and its derivatives were tested by sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA) at natural levels detected by ELISA. Thirty-eight urine extracts of Italian (n = 11) and northeastern European (n = 27) horses were tested on frozen-thawed spermatozoa to evaluate the toxic effect of mycotoxin on their chromatin structure by flow cytometry. Different parameters of the DNA fragmentation index (DFI), such as the mean (X -DFI), the percentage (%-DFI), and the standard deviation (SD-DFI), were analyzed. Urine samples showed a mean level of 32.3 ng/mL ZEA with significantly higher concentrations in northeastern European samples than in Italian samples, probably in relation to climatic and feeding differences. The toxic effects of ZEA-containing urine samples on SCSA parameters were found at low ZEA concentrations and were mainly observed in Italian samples. By using mycotoxin standards, ZEA, alpha-zearalenol, and beta-zearalenol proved to be more toxic compounds for sperm chromatin stability than other tested derivatives. A nongenomic mechanism of action can be hypothesized.

Meta-analysis: reduced incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients not responding to interferon therapy of chronic hepatitis C. Interferon treatment for chronic hepatitis C reduces the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in sustained responders. However, estimation of the effect of interferon treatment on HCC development in nonresponders is yet to be fully implemented. We conducted a meta-analysis of 3 randomized controlled trials and 6 prospective cohort studies, including 3,246 patients (1,922 patients received interferon treatment) to estimate the effect of single-course interferon treatment on HCC development in patients with chronic hepatitis C. Single-course interferon treatment prevented HCC development (RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.31-0.65). This preventive effect was shown even in nonresponders (RR 0.48; 95% CI 0.25-0.90). By subgroup analyses, single-course interferon treatment reduced HCC incidence in cirrhotic patients (RR 0.49; 95% CI 0.29-0.84), patients with annual HCC incidence less than 3% in control group (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.26-0.66) and patients with annual HCC incidence of 3% or more in control group (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.26-0.83). Furthermore, HCC incidence was reduced in 3 studies with follow-up period less than 5 years (RR 0.38; 95% CI 0.21-0.66) and in 6 studies with follow-up period of 5 years or more (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.28-0.76). In conclusion, single-course interferon treatment was shown to prevent HCC development in chronic hepatitis C, even in nonresponders. This preventive effect may be speculated to be due to anti-inflammatory effect on persistent necro-inflammation and blocking progression of fibrosis in liver. Even if sustained virological response is not achieved, interferon may be worth administering in order to reduce HCC incidence in patients with chronic hepatitis C.


Extensive human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) genomic DNA in the renal tubular epithelium early after renal transplantation: Relationship with HCMV DNAemia and long-term graft function.

A new syndrome associated with absence of lower lid lacrimal punctum, ptosis, elevation deficiency of both eyes and mild facial dysmorphism. A considerable volume of literature has been published on the association of lacrimal outflow dysgenesis with developmental anomalies or systemic syndromes. We report three affected individuals in a consanguineous family those are associated with bilateral ptosis, upper ocular movement limitation, and absence of the lacrimal punctum. T our knowledge, this is the first article reporting the association of bilateral ptosis, facial dysmorphism, upper ocular movement limitation, and absence of the lacrimal punctum in a hereditary form. As a sole example, these findings may be accepted as a new syndrome with autosomal recessive pattern because of consanguinity.

Abdominal surgery activates nesfatin-1 immunoreactive brain nuclei in rats. Abdominal surgery-induced postoperative gastric ileus is well established to induce Fos expression in specific brain nuclei in rats within 2-h after surgery. However, the phenotype of activated neurons has not been thoroughly characterized. Nesfatin-1 was recently discovered in the rat hypothalamus as a new anorexigenic peptide that also inhibits gastric emptying and is widely distributed in rat brain autonomic nuclei suggesting an involvement in stress responses. Therefore, we investigated whether abdominal surgery activates nesfatin-1-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in the rat brain. Two hours after abdominal surgery with cecal palpation under short isoflurane anesthesia or anesthesia alone, rats were transcardially perfused and brains processed for double immunohistochemical labeling of Fos and nesfatin-1. Abdominal surgery, compared to anesthesia alone, induced Fos expression in neurons of the supraoptic nucleus (SON), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), locus coeruleus (LC), Edinger-Westphal nucleus (EW), rostral raphe pallidus (rRPa), nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) and ventrolateral medulla (VLM). Double Fos/nesfatin-1 labeling showed that of the activated cells, 99% were nesfatin-1-immunoreactive in the SON, 91% in the LC, 82% in the rRPa, 74% in the EW and VLM, 71% in the anterior parvicellular PVN, 47% in the lateral magnocellular PVN, 41% in the medial magnocellular PVN, 14% in the NTS and 9% in the medial parvicellular PVN. These data established nesfatin-1 immunoreactive neurons in specific nuclei of the hypothalamus and brainstem as part of the neuronal response to abdominal surgery and suggest a possible implication of nesfatin-1 in the alterations of food intake and gastric transit associated with such a stressor.

The effect of powder properties on sintering, microstructure, mechanical strength and degradability of beta-tricalcium phosphate/calcium silicate composite bioceramics. The effect of powder properties on sintering, microstructure, mechanical strength and degradability of beta-tricalcium phosphate/calcium silicate (beta-Ca3(PO4)2/CaSiO3, beta-TCP/CS) composite bioceramics was investigated. beta-TCP/CS composite powders with a weight ratio of 50:50 were prepared by three different methods: mechanical milling method (TW-A), two-step chemical precipitation method (TW-B) and in situ chemical co-precipitation method (TW-C), and then the three composite powders were uniaxially compacted at 30 MPa, followed by cold isostatic pressing into rectangular-prism-shaped specimens under a pressure of 200 MPa for 15 min, and then sintered at 1150 degrees C for 5 h. The TW-B powders with less agglomerative morphologies and uniform nano-size particles attained 96.14% relative density (RD). A uniform microstructure with about 120 nm grains was observed. Whereas, the samples obtained from TW-A and TW-C powders only reached a RD of 63.08% and 78.86%, respectively. The bending strength of the samples fabricated from TW-B reached 125 MPa, which was more than 3.7 and 1.5 times higher as compared with that of samples obtained from TW-A and TW-C powders, respectively. Furthermore, the degradability of the samples fabricated from TW-B powders was obviously lower than that of the samples fabricated from TW-A and TW-C powders.

An extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma of the organ of Zuckerkandl: report of a case.

Apolipoprotein D synthesis progressively increases in frontal  cortex during human lifespan. Apolipoprotein D (apo D) is a lipocalin present in the nervous system that may be related to processes of reinnervation, regeneration and neuronal cell protection. On the other hand, apo D expression has been correlated, in some brain regions, with normal ageing and neurodegenerative diseases. To elucidate the regional and cellular expression of apo Din normal human brain during ageing, we performed a detailed and extensive study in samples of post-mortem human cerebral cortices. To achieve this study, slot-blot techniques, for protein and mRNA,as well as immunohistochemistry and hybridohistochemistry methods, were used. A positive correlation for apo D expression with ageing was found;furthermore, mRNA levels, as well as the protein ones, were higher in the white than in the grey matter. Immunohistochemistry and non-isotopic in situ hybridization showed that apo D is synthesised in both neurons and glial cells. Apo D expression is notorious in oligodendrocytes, but with ageing, the number of neurons that synthesise apo D is increased.Our results indicate that apo D could play a fundamental role in central nervous system ageing and in the reduction of products derived from lipid peroxidation. The increment in the expression of apo D with ageing can be included in a global mechanism of cellular protection to prevent the deleterious effects caused by ageing.

Quantitative analysis of function and perfusion during dobutamine stress in the detection of coronary stenoses: two-dimensional strain and contrast echocardiography investigations.

Cryopreservation of olive embryogenic cultures. The aim of this work was to optimize a protocol for the cryopreservation of embryogenic cultures of olive (Olea europaea L.). Exposure time to loading solution and PVS2 significantly influenced the regrowth rate of both organized and non-organized tissues. Organized tissues were more sensitive to prolonged treatments with vitrification solutions compared to non-organized tissues. Three cryopreservation protocols were compared using non-organized tissues: the "classical" vitrification protocol, an ultra-fast freezing method using droplet vitrification on aluminium foil strips and a "classical" slow freezing method (1 degree C per min). The best results were obtained using the droplet vitrification method after a 60 min dehydration period with PVS2. Under these conditions, all cryopreserved cultures showed renewed embryogenesis six weeks after thawing. A long-term (7-8 weeks) sucrose preculture had a significant effect on the initial response of the cultures, allowing particularly to protect cells against the toxic effects of the vitrification solution.

[Relationship between self-image and mental health of alcoholics]. Male patients (n=149) that consulted a physician specializing in the treatment of alcoholism at a hospital participated in this study. Their cognitions regarding emotional support networks, self-image, and mental health were investigated. Moreover, their cognition of stress was compared with a control group of general office workers (n=182). Result indicated that alcoholics had the following characteristics in comparison to the control group. (1) Lower cognition of emotional support. (2) Higher inclination to suppress real intentions and to be dependent. (3) Lower self-decision-making behavior. (4) Higher inclination to be irritated and anxious in daily life. Based on these results, it is suggested that providing support for increasing the cognition of emotional support networks and more self-decision-making behavior are important considerations in decreasing the stress cognition and improving the mental health of alcoholics.

Characteristics of smokers and predictors of quitting in a smoking cessation clinic in Guangzhou, China. Smoking cessation programs are well established in the West, but reports on smoking cessation clinics (SCCs) from China are lacking. On the basis of the Hong Kong experience and with strong support from Guangzhou Health Bureau, we established the first SCC in Guangzhou, China. The objective was to describe the characteristics of smokers, measure quit rates and examine predictors of successful quitting. During 2006-08, 220 smokers received individual counseling following the five A's and five R's. No medications were used. At baseline, the mean (SD) age was 40 (14) years. Most (96%) were males, married (73%), currently employed (75%), college educated or above (54%); 77% had previous quitting attempts. By 14 May 2008, 195 reached the 6 months follow-up period. Of them, 79% (151/195) were successfully followed up, and 46 had quit. By intention to treat, the 6-month 7-day point prevalence quit rate was 24% [95% confidence interval (CI) 18-30%]. Smokers with more confidence in quitting or were at action stage were more successful in quitting with adjusted odds ratio of 2.39 (95% CI 1.01-5.30) and 5.50 (95% CI 1.08-28) respectively. A pilot-model clinic free of charge and with systemic data collection, follow-up and evaluation should be a starting point for smoking cessation program in low-income countries.

Evaluation of the discriminative accuracy of genomic profiling in the prediction of common complex diseases.

Regulation of arginase pathway in response to wall shear stress. Alterations of wall shear stress can predispose the endothelium to the development of atherosclerotic plaques. Ample evidence indicates that arginase expression and/or activity correlates with several risk factors for cardiovascular disease including atherosclerosis. We investigated the regulation of arginase pathway in response to distinct patterns of wall shear stress. Isolated porcine endothelial cells and carotid arterial segments were perfused under unidirectional high shear stress (HSS) or oscillatory shear stress (OSS) for 1 and 3 days. Arginase I and II expression, cellular localization and enzyme activity were, respectively, assessed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry and colorimetric determination of urea. The contribution of arginase to the processes of endothelial dysfunction, cell proliferation and arterial remodeling induced by OSS was evaluated by administration of the arginase inhibitor N-omega-hydroxy-nor-l-arginine (nor-Noha). Only arginase II isoform was detected on porcine carotid endothelial cells and on carotid artery. Exposure of arteries to OSS increased arginase II expression and activity as compared to HSS. Inhibition of arginase by nor-Noha improved NO-dependent endothelial function and decreased total vascular ROS formation in arteries submitted to OSS. In addition, inhibition of arginase activity decreased smooth muscle cell proliferation rate with no effect on collagen content after OSS. Exposure of carotid artery to oscillatory flow induced a more pronounced activation of arginase as compared to HSS. Inhibition of arginase in arteries exposed to OSS improved NO-dependent endothelial function and decrease smooth muscle cell proliferation rate, both processes are important for the focal development of atherosclerotic plaque.

Barriers and opportunities for recruitment for nonintervention studies on HIV risk: perspectives of street drug users. This study used focus-group discussions in response to a video vignette to examine attitudes toward recruitment for nonintervention research involving HIV testing. Participants were 100 ethnically diverse, economically disadvantaged urban drug users, who were recruited from New York City and Hartford, Connecticut in the spring and summer of 2006. Content analyses revealed themes including (1) fears of stigma and legal trouble balanced by trustworthiness of the recruiter; (2) fears of learning one's HIV status balanced by prospects for health benefits, and (3) the right to receive fair monetary compensation balanced by risks of coercion during periods of cravings. Limitations and implications for recruitment practices have been discussed here.

Venous catheter-associated bacteremia caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria at a medical center in central Taiwan. Infections due to rapidly growing mycobacteria (RGM) are increasing worldwide, especially in immunocompromised hosts, but data on the clinical features of patients with RGM bacteremia are limited in Taiwan. This study was performed to determine the features associated with RGM. The medical records of 12 patients with RGM bacteremia admitted to the Changhua Christian Hospital, Changhua, Taiwan, from April 2001 to March 2003 were retrospectively studied. Clinical data were reviewed and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of blood isolates by the agar disk elution method was performed. RGM bacteremia was caused by Mycobacterium fortuitum in 5 patients, Mycobacterium smegmatis in 3, Mycobacterium flavescens in 2, and Mycobacterium abscessus in 2. There were 5 men and 7 women (age range, 4-75 years). All patients had underlying diseases and all of the infections were associated with an indwelling vascular catheter. The time to onset of bacteremia ranged from 1 to 24 months. Fever (n = 11) was the most common presenting symptom. Susceptibility testing revealed a different antibiogram for each species of RGM. The rate of relapsing bacteremia was significantly higher in patients with delayed catheter removal and for whom the catheter was not removed (6/8; 75%) than in patients with timely catheter removal (0/4; 0%) [p = 0.03]. RGM bacteremia is rare but should be considered in immunocompromised patients with an indwelling venous catheter and undifferentiated fever. Identifying RGM at the species level and performing susceptibility testing are useful for guiding management. The catheter should be removed as soon as possible.


Knockdown of HBx by RNAi inhibits proliferation and enhances chemotherapy-induced apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma cells.

The Reliability and Validity of the Perceived Dietary Adherence Questionnaire for People with Type 2 Diabetes. Nutrition therapy is essential for diabetes treatment, and assessment of dietary intake can be time consuming. The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable and valid instrument to measure diabetic patients' adherence to Canadian diabetes nutrition recommendations. Specific information derived from three, repeated 24-h dietary recalls of 64 type 2 diabetic patients, aged 59.2 Â± 9.7 years, was correlated with a total score and individual items of the Perceived Dietary Adherence Questionnaire (PDAQ). Test-retest reliability was completed by 27 type 2 diabetic patients, aged 62.8 Â± 8.4 years. The correlation coefficients for PDAQ items versus 24-h recalls ranged from 0.46 to 0.11. The intra-class correlation (0.78) was acceptable, indicating good reliability. The results suggest that PDAQ is a valid and reliable measure of diabetes nutrition recommendations. Because it is quick to administer and score, it may be useful as a screening tool in research and as a clinical tool to monitor dietary adherence. 

[Preventive effects of pueraria on presbycusis in rats]. To investigate the preventive effects of Pueraria on presbycusis in rats. Thirty-two 24-26 month old Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups, and were treated with different dosages of Pueraria (1, 2, 4, 0 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)) separately for 4 weeks. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) was used to detect the change of hearing threshold of rats. Hemorheological items of rats were checked in each group. Compared with control group, the hearing threshold and hemorheological items of rats was significantly improved after treated with Pueraria (P<0.05). In addition, 2 g/(kg x d) was found to be the best dosage of Pueraria for rats, which can achieve ideal effect with minimum side effect. Pueraria could improve tiny circulation, has good preventive effect on presbycusis of rats.

Sensitivity and specificity of plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green as a prognostic indicator in acute liver failure. In patients presenting with acute liver failure (ALF) prediction of prognosis is vital to determine the need of transplantation. Based on the evidence that plasma disappearance rate of indocyanine green (ICG-PDR) correlates with liver cell function, we evaluated the ability of ICG-PDR measured by pulse dye densitometry to predict outcome in patients with acute liver failure. Prospectively markers of hepatocellular injury, synthesis and excretion, including ICG-PDR were measured daily until liver transplantation, death, discharge from intensive care unit, or up to 7 days in 25 patients with acute liver failure. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the value of ICG-PDR to predict outcome in ALF. The 25 patients analyzed included 18 that recovered spontaneously and 7 that underwent liver transplantation (n = 6) or died (n = 1). Causes of ALF included viral hepatitis (n = 4), toxic liver injury (n = 15), ischemic liver injury (n = 2), and cryptogenic liver failure (n = 4). King's college criteria were fulfilled in 85.7% of patients not recovering spontaneously and in 16.7% of patients recovering spontaneously. The mean ICG-PDR measured on day 1 in patients recovering spontaneously was 12.0 +/- 7.8%/min and in patients not recovering spontaneously 4.3 +/- 2.0%/min (P = 0.002). By ROC analysis the sensitivity and specificity of an ICG-PDR value <or= 6.3%/min on study day 1 were 85.7% and 88.9%, respectively, for predicting a non spontaneous outcome in ALF. ICG-PDR allows early and sensitive bedside assessment of liver dysfunction in ALF. Measurement of ICG-PDR might be helpful in predicting the outcome in acute liver failure.

Bisnaphthalimidopropyl derivatives as inhibitors of Leishmania SIR2 related protein 1.

Structure modeling, synthesis and X-ray diffraction determination of an extra-large calixarene-based coordination cage and its application in drug delivery. An extra-large octahedral coordination cage (CIAC-114) was designed and modeled based on Co4-p-tert-butylsulfonylcalix[4]arene (Co4-(SC4A-SO2)) subunits and 4,4',4''-(benzene-1,3,5-triyl-tris(benzene-4,1-diyl))tribenzoate (BBB) ligands via the isomorphic replacement approach built from an analogous cage structure with a smaller size. X-ray crystallography revealed that the crystals obtained through solvothermal synthesis exhibited the anticipated structure. Each CIAC-114 cage is assembled by six tetranuclear Co4-(SC4A-SO2) units as vertices, which bear a four-fold rotational symmetry, and eight tripodal BBB ligands as linkers, which hold a D3h symmetry. Among its analogues CIAC-114 has the largest overall peripheral diameter of 5.4 nm and an internal cavity of 2.7 nm. After treatment by supercritical CO2, a single crystal sample of CIAC-114 transformed into amorphous material with the retention of the cage skeleton, which demonstrated good adsorption properties towards a small drug molecule, ibuprofen (Ibu), evidenced by IR spectroscopy, (1)H NMR spectroscopy, N2 sorption analysis, and drug release experiments. The Ibu release experiment in phosphate buffered saline solution (pH = 7.4) revealed that CIAC-114 exhibited a slow drug release behavior. 

Metalinguistic filters within the bilingual language faculty: a study of young English-Chinese bilinguals. This study reports two metalinguistic parameters that constitute the schematic control of lateral inhibitory links between translation equivalents within the bilingual lexico-semantic system of Green's (Bilingualism: Language and Cognition 1:67-81, 1998a, Bilingualism: Language and Cognition 1:100-104, 1998b, The bilingualism reader, Routledge, London, 2007) inhibitory control (IC) model. Building on Green's postulation that the bilingual lexico-semantic system is controlled by a hierarchy of schemas under a supervisory attentional system, the bilingual unconsciously filters activated lemmas during fluent spontaneous codeswitching, such that lemmas that are semantico-syntactically versatile or morphosyntactically transparent are likely to reach a threshold of activation first while other lemmas are inhibited. To investigate the issue, we collected code-paired naturalistic and elicited data with a focus on code-switched determiner phrases from 140 Mandarin-English simultaneous bilinguals who were post-secondary students in Singapore. We found that the semantico-syntactic and morpho-syntactic dissimilarities between Mandarin and English activated both filters. As most Mandarin determiners are economical vis-Ã -vis their English counterparts, their lemmas were selected frequently while English lemmas were largely inhibited. It was also found that our participants preferred English nouns in filling the lexical category for their interpretable feature of number, a feature that is normally absent in Mandarin nouns.

Evaluation of supercritical fluid engineered budesonide powder for respiratory delivery using nebulisers. Currently, suspensions prepared from micronised drug substances are the only delivery system marketed for nebulisation of steroids, and reported inconsistent or low bioavailability arising from their use provides a rationale for researching alternative formulations. Supercritical fluid processing of drug substances to obtain respirable-sized particles has been used over the last decade to formulate dry powder inhalers. We aimed thus to process budesonide powder to improve its deposition characteristics. In an attempt to overcome the limitations of nebuliser suspensions when prepared from micronised drug particles, budesonide powder was processed using a supercritical fluid based process and suspended using Tween 80 as a surfactant to provide an aqueous nebuliser formulation. The in-vitro characteristics of the emitted dose on nebulisation for the prepared suspension were then compared to a commercially available suspension formulation of budesonide using a jet and a vibrating mesh nebuliser. The results showed a significant improvement of the in-vitro deposition properties of the suspension containing supercritical fluid engineered budesonide particles. The results indicated the benefit of such materials compared with traditionally micronised drug powders.

Nkx2.2 activates the ghrelin promoter in pancreatic islet cells. Nkx2.2 is an essential regulator of pancreatic endocrine differentiation. Nkx2.2-null mice are completely devoid of beta-ells and have a large reduction of alpha- and PP cells. In the place of these islet populations, there is a corresponding increase in the ghrelin-positive epsilon-cells. Molecular studies have indicated that Nkx2.2 functions as an activator and repressor to regulate islet cell fate decisions. To determine whether Nkx2.2 is solely important for islet cell fate decisions or also has the capability to control ghrelin at the promoter level, we studied the transcriptional regulation of the ghrelin promoter within the pancreas, in vitro and in vivo. These studies demonstrate that both of the previously identified transcriptional start sites in the ghrelin promoter are active within the embryonic pancreas; however, the long transcript is preferentially up-regulated in the Nkx2.2-null pancreas. We also show that the promoter region between -619 and -488 bp upstream of the translational start site is necessary for repression of ghrelin in alphaTC1 and betaTC6 cells. Surprisingly, we also show that Nkx2.2 is able to bind to and activate the ghrelin promoter in several cell lines that do or do not express endogenous ghrelin. Together, these results suggest that the up-regulation of ghrelin expression in the Nkx2.2-null mice is not due to loss of repression of the ghrelin promoter in the nonghrelin islet populations. Furthermore, Nkx2.2 may contribute to the activation of ghrelin in mature islet epsilon-cells.

GO-At: in silico prediction of gene function in Arabidopsis thaliana by combining heterogeneous data. Despite recent advances, accurate gene function prediction remains an elusive goal, with very few methods directly applicable to the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study, we present GO-At (gene ontology prediction in A. thaliana), a method that combines five data types (co-expression, sequence, phylogenetic profile, interaction and gene neighbourhood) to predict gene function in Arabidopsis. Using a simple, yet powerful two-step approach, GO-At first generates a list of genes ranked in descending order of probability of functional association with the query gene. Next, a prediction score is automatically assigned to each function in this list based on the assumption that functions appearing most frequently at the top of the list are most likely to represent the function of the query gene. In this way, the second step provides an effective alternative to simply taking the 'best hit' from the first list, and achieves success rates of up to 79%. GO-At is applicable across all three GO categories: molecular function, biological process and cellular component, and can assign functions at multiple levels of annotation detail. Furthermore, we demonstrate GO-At's ability to predict functions of uncharacterized genes by identifying ten putative golgins/Golgi-associated proteins amongst 8219 genes of previously unknown cellular component and present independent evidence to support our predictions. A web-based implementation of GO-At (http://www.bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/goat) is available, providing a unique resource for plant researchers to make predictions for uncharacterized genes and predict novel functions in Arabidopsis.


Detection of multiscale pockets on protein surfaces using mathematical morphology.

Molecular phylogeny of the subfamily Stevardiinae Gill, 1858 (Characiformes: Characidae): classification and the evolution of reproductive traits. The subfamily Stevardiinae is a diverse and widely distributed clade of freshwater fishes from South and Central America, commonly known as "tetras" (Characidae). The group was named "clade A" when first proposed as a monophyletic unit of Characidae and later designated as a subfamily. Stevardiinae includes 48 genera and around 310 valid species with many species presenting inseminating reproductive strategy. No global hypothesis of relationships is available for this group and currently many genera are listed as incertae sedis or are suspected to be non-monophyletic. We present a molecular phylogeny with the largest number of stevardiine species analyzed so far, including 355 samples representing 153 putative species distributed in 32 genera, to test the group's monophyly and internal relationships. The phylogeny was inferred using DNA sequence data from seven gene fragments (mtDNA: 12S, 16S and COI; nuclear: RAG1, RAG2, MYH6 and PTR). The results support the Stevardiinae as a monophyletic group and a detailed hypothesis of the internal relationships for this subfamily. A revised classification based on the molecular phylogeny is proposed that includes seven tribes and also defines monophyletic genera, including a resurrected genus Eretmobrycon, and new definitions for Diapoma, Hemibrycon, Bryconamericus sensu stricto, and Knodus sensu stricto, placing some small genera as junior synonyms. Inseminating species are distributed in several clades suggesting that reproductive strategy is evolutionarily labile in this group of fishes.

GP responses to price regulation: evidence from a French nationwide reform. This paper uses a French reform to evaluate the impacts of overbilling restrictions on general practitioner (GP) care provision, fees and incomes. Since 1990, this reform has introduced conditions self-employed GPs must fulfil to be permitted to bill freely. We exploit 2005 and 2008 public health insurance administrative data on GP activity and fees. We use fuzzy regression discontinuity techniques to estimate local causal impacts for GPs who established practices in 1990 and who were constrained by the new regulation to charge regulated prices (compliers). We find that those GPs practices to income effects. In the regulated fee regime, GPs face prices lower by 42% and provide 50% more care than they would do in the unregulated fee regime. Male care provision increasing reaction is larger than the female one, which results in a higher male labour income in the regulated fee regime than with unregulated fees, whereas it is the opposite for women. With regulated fees, GPs limit side-salaried activities, use more lump-sum payment schemes and occupy more often gatekeeper positions.

An initial step of GAS-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles formation requires Rab7. Group A streptococcus (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes) is a common pathogen that invades non-phagocytic human cells via endocytosis. Once taken up by cells, it escapes from the endocytic pathway to the cytoplasm, but here it is contained within a membrane-bound structure termed GAS-containing autophagosome-like vacuoles (GcAVs). The autophagosome marker GFP-LC3 associates with GcAVs, and other components of the autophagosomal pathway are involved in GcAV formation. However, the mechanistic relationship between GcAV and canonical autophagy is largely unknown. Here, we morphologically analyzed GcAV formation in detail. Initially, a small, GFP-LC3-positive GcAV sequesters each streptococcal chain, and these then coalesce into a single, large GcAV. Expression of a dominant-negative form of Rab7 or RNAi-mediated knockdown of Rab7 prevented the initial formation of small GcAV structures. Our results demonstrate that mechanisms of GcAV formation includes not only the common machinery of autophagy, but also Rab7 as an additional component, which is dispensable in canonical autophagosome formation.


Lifetime estimation of wireless body area sensor network for patient health monitoring.

Safety and feasibility of adjunctive antiplatelet therapy with intravenous elinogrel, a direct-acting and reversible P2Y12 ADP-receptor antagonist, before primary percutaneous intervention in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction: the Early Rapid ReversAl of platelet thromboSis with intravenous Elinogrel before PCI to optimize reperfusion in acute Myocardial Infarction (ERASE MI) pilot trial. Inhibition of the P2Y12 ADP-receptor with oral antiplatelet agents given to patients undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is associated with improved outcomes, but this strategy is limited by the time required for maximal antiplatelet effect after administration. We examined the safety and tolerability of a novel, direct-acting, reversible, intravenous P2Y12 ADP-receptor antagonist, elinogrel, versus placebo when administered to STEMI patients before primary PCI. The ERASE MI trial was a pilot, phase IIA, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses (10, 20, 40, and 60 mg) of elinogrel administered as a single intravenous bolus before the start of the diagnostic angiogram preceding primary PCI. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 manner to either elinogrel or placebo within each dosing group; and all patients received a 600-mg clopidogrel loading dose, followed by a second 300-mg clopidogrel loading dose 4 hours after PCI. The major outcome, in-hospital bleeding, was assessed with the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction and Global Strategies to Open Occluded Coronary Arteries bleeding scales. Pre-PCI corrected Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction frame count and ST-segment resolution were also evaluated. Seventy patients were randomized in the dose-escalation study, but the dose-confirmation phase was not started because the trial was prematurely terminated for administrative reasons. The incidence of bleeding events was infrequent and appeared to be similar in patients treated with all doses of elinogrel versus placebo. No differences in serious adverse events, laboratory values, corrected Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction frame count, or ST resolution were demonstrated between elinogrel and placebo. With the limitations of a small study sample size, this pilot study provided preliminary data on the feasibility and tolerability of escalating doses of a direct-acting, reversible, intravenous P2Y12 ADP-receptor antagonist, elinogrel, as an adjunctive therapy for primary PCI for STEMI.

Atrial fibrillation and NPPA gene p.S64R mutation: are cardiologists helpless spectators of healthy mutation carriers? Heterozygous p.(Ser64Arg) mutation in the natriuretic peptide precursor A gene has been associated with atrial fibrillation in the presence of common single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs10033464 and rs2200733; 4q25) that would act as modifiers. We screened natriuretic peptide precursor A gene in 583 individuals and identified three unrelated carriers of the p.(Ser64Arg) mutation (0.5%). Only one of the three mutation carriers had episodes of atrial fibrillation. Cascade screening of the three families identified seven additional mutation carriers, none showing atrial fibrillation. The patients with atrial fibrillation also carried the rs2200733, which was however found in four additional nonatrial fibrillation family members and carriers of the p.(Ser64Arg). The prevalence of atrial fibrillation in p.(Ser64Arg) carriers was 10% and in those combining the mutation with the risk single nucleotide polymorphisms was 20%. In the unique mutated patient with atrial fibrillation, the arrhythmias was refractory to both pharmacological and ablation treatment, during 16 years of follow-up; his electrophysiological phenotype was characterized by short atrial cycle lengths with a median value of 131 ms that suggests shortening of atrial action potential. The prevalence of p.(Ser64Arg) mutation is low in the general population as is the prevalence of atrial fibrillation in mutation carriers (1/10). Atrial fibrillation in the affected mutated patient was lone at onset and progressively evolved with peculiar electrophysiological patterns.

Identification and characterization of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus genetic variants isolated in Korea. Nine isolates of rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) were used for the genetic characterization of RHDV strains collected from rabbits in Korea between 2006 and 2008. A phylogenetic analysis of the complete VP60 region was performed and the sequences were divided mainly into two groups. The one group consisted of original RHDV and the other contained antigenic variant strain known as RHDVa strains. Most of the Korean isolates clustered with Chinese RHDV strains and belonged to the RHDVa subtype. A comparison of the amino acid sequences among RHDVa strains and original RHDV strains revealed significant substitutions of two amino acids in the A region, two in the B region, two in the F region, and nine amino acids in the E region. Taken together, the recent RHDVa strains have gradually replaced the original RHDV and are the predominant strains in Korea.

Treatment of crusted scabies with albendazole: A case report. Crusted scabies is a severe variant of scabies caused by the ectoparasite Sarcoptes scabiei. It is characterized by high mite burden, extensive hyperkeratotic scaling, crusted lesions, variable pruritus, generalized lymphadenopathy, erythroderma, and eosinophilia, in some cases. There is an increased incidence of crusted scabies, particularly among patients with HIV infection. We describe a 22-year-old Syrian immunocompetent female who had hyperkeratotic psoriasiform plaques and hyperkeratosis without itching. She was treated with oral albendazole and topical crotamiton with salicylic acid 5 percent.

Systemic and Intravitreal Delivery of Dendrimers to Activated Microglia/Macrophage in Ischemia/Reperfusion Mouse Retina. Microglial activation and associated neuroinflammation play a key role in the pathogenesis of many diseases of the retina, including viral infection, diabetes, and retinal degeneration. Strategies to target activated microglia and macrophages and attenuate inflammation may be valuable in treating these diseases. We seek to develop dendrimer-based formulations that target retinal microglia and macrophages in a pathology-dependent manner, and deliver drugs, either intravenously or intravitreally. Retinal uptake of cyanine dye (Cy5)-conjugated dendrimer (D-Cy5) was assessed in normal and ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) mouse eyes. Microglia/macrophage uptake of the dendrimer was assessed with immunofluorescence using rabbit Iba-1 antibody with Cy3-tagged secondary antibody (microglia/macrophage). Uptake in retina and other organs was quantified using fluorescence spectroscopy. Clearance of D-Cy5 from normal eyes was almost complete by 72 hours after intravitreal injection and 24 hours after intravenous delivery. In eyes with activated microglia after I/R injury, D-Cy5 was retained by activated microglia/macrophage (Iba1+ cells) up to 21 days after intravitreal and intravenous administration. In I/R eyes, the relative retention of intravitreal and intravenous D-Cy5 was comparable, if a 30-fold higher intravenous dose was used. Intravitreal and systemic dendrimers target activated microglia and show qualitatively similar retinal biodistribution when administered by either route. Results provide proof-of-concept insights for developing dendrimer drug formulations as treatment options for retinal diseases associated with microglia or macrophage activation such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal degenerations.

The role of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha in transcriptional regulation of novel organic cation transporters. Former studies in rats demonstrated that starvation or treatment with the hypolipidemic drug clofibrate causes a marked increase in the concentration of carnitine in the liver. The molecular mechanisms underlying these phenomena in rats, however, have been largely unknown. Since both, fasting and clofibrate treatment lead to an activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), the hypothesis has been raised that activation of this nuclear receptor could lead to an up-regulation of novel organic cation transporters (OCTN) which facilitate transport of carnitine and several other organic cations through membranes. Studies in rodents and pigs have indeed shown that treatment with PPARalpha agonists causes an up-regulation of OCTN2 in liver and other tissues such as muscle and small intestine. Additional experiments with PPARalpha-null and corresponding wild-type mice, which were either fasted or treated with the high-affinity PPARalpha agonist WY-14,643, revealed that transcriptional up-regulation of OCTN2 and OCTN3 is dependent on PPARalpha. An up-regulation of OCTN by PPARalpha activation could be regarded as a means to supply cells with sufficient carnitine required for transport of excessive amounts of fatty acids into the mitochondrion during fasting, and therefore plays an important role in the adaptive response of the metabolism to fasting. Due to the strong similarities in the gene response to PPARalpha agonists and the similar metabolic features and anatomic conditions between pigs and humans, it is likely that pharmacological PPARalpha agonists exert similar effects in humans.

Fresh frozen plasma and recombinant factor VIIa use in neonates. Little recent data are available describing fresh frozen plasma (FFP) use in neonates. The purpose of this study was to determine the outcomes of FFP transfusions in neonates. A single institution, observational, and retrospective review of each transfusion of FFP given to neonates admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit over a 2-year period. One hundred and seventy-three neonates were identified as having received FFP, giving a prevalence of FFP use at 12%. By far the most common determining factor for FFP use was an association with an abnormal activated partial thromboplastin time or prothrombin time (52%). Other factors included bleeding, invasive procedures, volume expansion, necrotizing enterocolitis, cardiopulmonary bypass, and hydrops fetalis. Of objectively accessible responses, FFP was able to correct abnormal coagulation tests into the normal range only 40% of the time. Twenty-four neonates received recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) after first receiving FFP. The prevalence of thrombotic events was not higher in neonates receiving rFVIIa than those receiving FFP alone. FFP was widely used in this neonatal unit. As data showing the predictive value of coagulation tests in neonates are discrepant, it is unclear if FFP was being appropriately used. Prospective, controlled data are required.

Functional morphology of the female reproductive apparatus of Stephanitis pyrioides (Heteroptera, Tingidae): a novel role for the pseudospermathecae.

Comparative finite element analysis of the cranial performance of four herbivorous marsupials. Marsupial herbivores exhibit a wide variety of skull shapes and sizes to exploit different ecological niches. Several studies on teeth, dentaries, and jaw adductor muscles indicate that marsupial herbivores exhibit different specializations for grazing and browsing. No studies, however, have examined the skulls of marsupial herbivores to determine the relationship between stress and strain, and the evolution of skull shape. The relationship between skull morphology, biomechanical performance, and diet was tested by applying the finite element method to the skulls of four marsupial herbivores: the common wombat (Vombatus ursinus), koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), swamp wallaby (Wallabia bicolor), and red kangaroo (Macropus rufus). It was hypothesized that grazers, requiring stronger skulls to process tougher food, would have higher biomechanical performance than browsers. This was true when comparing the koala and wallaby (browsers) to the wombat (a grazer). The cranial model of the wombat resulted in low stress and high mechanical efficiency in relation to a robust skull capable of generating high bite forces. However, the kangaroo, also a grazer, has evolved a very different strategy to process tough food. The cranium is much more gracile and has higher stress and lower mechanical efficiency, but they adopt a different method of processing food by having a curved tooth row to concentrate force in a smaller area and molar progression to remove worn teeth from the tooth row. Therefore, the position of the bite is crucial for the structural performance of the kangaroo skull, while it is not for the wombat which process food along the entire tooth row. In accordance with previous studies, the results from this study show the mammalian skull is optimized to resist forces generated during feeding. However, other factors, including the lifestyle of the animal and its environment, also affect selection for skull morphology to meet multiple functional demands.


Anatomy of the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus on MR imaging.

Low bone mineral density is an independent risk factor for stroke and death. Recent studies suggest a relationship between atherosclerotic disease and osteoporosis. The aim of the study was to investigate whether bone mineral density (BMD) was prospectively related to stroke and death. BMD (g/cm(2)) was measured in 4,302 men and women (mean age 59 years, range 40-75) at baseline. The main outcome measures included validated strokes and death. After a mean follow-up time of 5.6 years (range 0-15.8 years), 139 strokes were registered and 224 subjects had died. After adjustment for age, sex and body mass index, decreased femoral neck BMD and osteoporosis were found to be independent predictors of stroke (hazard ratio, HR, for each standard deviation decrease in BMD = 1.23, 95% CI = 1.01-1.49, and HR for osteoporosis = 1.92, 95% CI = 1.11-3.30). After adjustment for the same variables, the risk of death during follow-up was related to femoral neck BMD (HR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.21-1.64) and osteoporosis at baseline (HR = 2.05, 95% CI = 1.28-3.29). Adjustment also for smoking, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes did not change any of these results. We found that decreased BMD as well as osteoporosis of the femoral neck are independently associated with stroke and death. Given the impact of osteoporosis and stroke on morbidity and mortality, this relationship is of high interest for further studies.

Effectiveness and tolerability of zonisamide in children with epilepsy: a retrospective review. To evaluate the effectiveness and tolerability of zonisamide in children with epilepsy. Retrospective case note review of young people (less than 19 years) with epilepsy from three UK tertiary centres who received treatment with zonisamide and were followed up for a minimum of 12 months. Fifty-seven children were included, aged 1.5-18.5 (median, 12) years. Thirty-three (57.9%) patients had generalised epilepsy, 21 (36.8%) focal epilepsy, and three (5.3%) a mixed, generalised and focal, epilepsy. Fifty-six of the 57 patients had been refractory to at least three previous antiepileptic drugs. The maintenance dose of zonisamide was [range (median)] 0.7-14 (5)mg/kg/day. The median duration of treatment for all patients was 12 (range 0.25-35) months. After 2 months of treatment, 51 patients remained on zonisamide, 18 (35.3%) of whom demonstrated a > or =50% reduction in seizure frequency. At the end of the follow-up period, there was a loss of effect for some patients. Thirteen (25.5%) of the 51 patients continued to demonstrate a > or =50% reduction in seizure frequency whilst two who had become seizure-free started having seizures again. Six (11.8%) had <50% reduction, twenty-four (47%) had no change, and eight (15.7%) had increasing seizures. Twenty-five (43.9%) patients reported unwanted effects although this contributed to the withdrawal of zonisamide in only ten (17.6%) patients. Zonisamide appeared to be a reasonably effective and generally well-tolerated antiepileptic drug in a heterogeneous group of 57 children with poorly controlled epilepsy and provides another treatment option for children with refractory seizures.

Diagnostic accuracy systematic review of rectal bleeding in combination with other symptoms, signs and tests in relation to colorectal cancer. Rectal bleeding is a recognised early symptom of colorectal cancer. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of symptoms, signs and diagnostic tests in patients with rectal bleeding in relation to risk of colorectal cancer in primary care. Diagnostic accuracy systematic review. Medline (1966 to May 2009), Embase (1988 to May 2009), British Nursing Index (1991 to May 2009) and PsychINFO (1970 to May 2009) were searched. We included cohort studies that assessed the diagnostic utility of rectal bleeding in combination with other symptoms, signs and diagnostic tests in primary care. An eight-point quality assessment tool was produced to assess the quality of included studies. Pooled positive likelihood ratios (PLRs), sensitivities and specificities were calculated. Eight studies incorporating 2323 patients were included. Average weighted prior probability of colorectal cancer was 7.0% (range: 3.3-15.4%, median: 8.1%). Age > or = 60 years (pooled PLR: 2.79, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.00-3.90), weight loss (pooled PLR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.03-3.07) and change in bowel habit (pooled PLR: 1.92, 95% CI: 0.54-3.57) raise the probability of colorectal cancer into the range of referral to secondary care but do not conclusively 'rule in' the diagnosis. Presence of severe anaemia has the highest diagnostic value (pooled PLR: 3.67, 95% CI: 1.30-10.35), specificity 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93-0.96), but still only generates a post-test probability of 21.6%. In patients with rectal bleeding who present to their general practitioner, additional 'red flag' symptoms have modest diagnostic value. These findings have implications in relation to recommendations contained in clinical practice guidelines.

Growth of different morphologies (quantum dots to nanorod) of Ag-nanoparticles: role of cysteine concentrations. This work describes an easy chemical method for the preparation of orange-red color silver sol by the cysteine reduction of silver (I) in the presence of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The obtained sol was found to have very small particles in the order of quantum dots for the first time. Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images show that the silver sol consists of aggregated as well as cross-linking arrangement of spherical silver quantum dots (size in the range ca. <or=16nm). In addition, we observed the changes in the morphologies of the Ag-nanoparticles from quantum dots to nanorod of diameter 60nm and pearl-necklace shaped which occurred due to the cross-linking aggregation of silver quantum dots. For a certain reaction time, i.e., 100min, the absorbance of reaction mixture first increased until it reached a maximum, then decreased with [cysteine]. The rate of Ag-nanoparticles formation decreases with the increase in [cysteine] whereas [CTAB] and [Ag(+)] have no effect on the reaction rate. Interestingly, at higher [cysteine] (>or=20.0x10(-4)mol dm(-3)), white precipitate was formed instead of transparent silver sol. Cysteine acts as a reducing, cross-linking, stabilizing and buffering agent during the growth of different shape and size of silver nanoparticles.


Introducing mother's curse: low male fertility associated with an imported mtDNA haplotype in a captive colony of brown hares.

The role of decision-making in cannabis-related problems among young adults. Deficits in decision-making and episodic memory are often reported among heavy cannabis users, yet little is known on how they influence negative consequences from cannabis use. Individual differences in decision-making may explain, in part, why some individuals experience significant problems from their cannabis use whereas others do not. We hypothesized that poor decision-making would moderate relationships between amount of cannabis use and problems from cannabis use whereas episodic memory performance would not. Young adult cannabis users (n=52) with cannabis as their drug of choice and with minimal comorbidities completed semi-structured interviews, self-report questionnaires, and measures of neurocognitive functioning, with decision-making accessed via the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), episodic memory via the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test - Revised (HVLT) and problems from cannabis use with the Marijuana Problems Scale. Strong relationships were observed between amount of cannabis use (lifetime, 12-month, and 30-day) and problems reported from use, but only among participants with low (impaired) decision-making (R(2)=.39 to .51; p<.01). No significant relationships were observed among those with better (low average to high average) decision-making performance (p>.05). In contrast, episodic memory performance was not a significant moderator of the relationship between amount of cannabis use and cannabis problems (p>.05). Cannabis users with poor decision-making may be at greater risk for experiencing significant negative consequences from their cannabis use. Our results lend further support to emerging evidence of decision-making as a risk factor for addiction and extend these findings to cannabis users.

Thrombotic risk assessment in the antiphospholipid syndrome requires more than the quantification of lupus anticoagulants. Lupus anticoagulants (LACs) are associated with thromboembolic complications (TECs). LACs can be detected by their anticoagulant properties in thrombin generation assays, by the peak height (PH) and lag time (LT). To assess the thrombotic risk in LAC-positive patients, we have expressed the LAC activity quantitatively by PH/LT calibration curves, constructed for mixtures of monoclonal antibodies against beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2GPI) and prothrombin, spiked in normal plasma. PH/LT was determined in LAC patients, with (n = 38) and without (n = 21) TECs and converted into arbitrary LAC units. LAC titers ranged from 0 to 200 AU/mL, with 5 of 59 patients being negative. In the positive LAC titer population (54 of 59), LAC and anti-beta2GPI immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers correlated with TECs, with odds ratios of 3.54 (95% CI, 1.0-1.7) and 10.0 (95% CI, 1.98-50.6), respectively. In patients with single or combined low titers, useful predictions on thrombosis could be made only after additional measurements of soluble P-selectin and factor VII. This layered strategy yielded positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity, and specificity values approximately 90% in this subgroup. Hence, LAC and anti-beta2GPI IgG titers, when combined with selected markers of the hypercoagulable state, allow a relevant thrombotic risk assessment in nearly all patients with LACs.


Do we need new surgical techniques to repair vesico-vaginal fistulas?

Lipid-bilayer permeation of drug-like compounds. Lipid-bilayer permeation is determinant for the disposition of xenobiotics in the body. It controls the pharmacokinetic behavior of drugs and is, in many cases, a prerequisite for intracellular targeting. Permeation of in vivo barriers is in general predicted from lipophilicity and related parameters. This article goes beyond the empirical correlations, and elucidates the processes and their interplay determining bilayer permeation. A flip-flop model for bilayer permeation, which considers the partitioning rate constants beside the translocation rate constants, is compared with the diffusion model based on Fick's first law. According to the flip-flop model, the ratios of aqueous volumes to barrier area can determine whether partitioning or translocation is rate-limiting. The flip-flop model allows permeation of anions and cations, and expands our understanding of pH-dependent permeation kinetics. Some experimental evidences for ion-controlled permeation at pH 7 are also included in this work.

Protective effect of supplemental anthocyanins on Arabidopsis leaves under high light. Ten anthocyanin components have been detected in roots of purple sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas Lam.) by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detection and electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. All the anthocyanins were exclusively cyanidins or peonidin 3-sophoroside-5-glucosides and their acylated derivatives. The total anthocyanin content in purple sweet potato powder obtained by solid-phase extraction was 66 mg g(-1). A strong capacity of purple sweet potato anthocyanins (PSPA) to scavenge reactive oxygen species (superoxide, hydroxyl radical) and the stable 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl organic free radical was found in vitro using the electron spin resonance technique. To determine the functional roles of anthocyanins in leaves in vivo, for the first time, supplemental anthocyanins were infiltrated into leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana double mutant of the ecotype Landsberg erecta (tt3tt4) deficient in anthocyanin biosynthesis. Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging showed that anthocyanins significantly ameliorated the inactivation of photosystems II during prolonged high-light (1300 micromol m(-2) s(-1)) exposure. Comet assay of DNA revealed an obvious role of supplemental PSPA in alleviating DNA damage by high light in leaves. Our results suggest that anthocyanins could function in vitro and in vivo to alleviate the direct or indirect oxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus and DNA in plants caused by high-light stress.

Tobacco coverage in print media: the use of timing and themes by tobacco control supporters and opposition before a failed tobacco tax initiative. Tobacco control policies gained ground nationwide in 2006, with voters in nine states approving legislation to strengthen clean indoor air policies and increase tobacco excise taxes. Despite having the second lowest cigarette tax rate in the nation, Missouri was unsuccessful in passing its 2006 ballot initiative to raise the tax. An important way to encourage health-related policy change such as increasing tobacco taxes is through media coverage of tobacco issues. We examined how tobacco issues were presented in Missouri's print media leading up to the 2006 election. This study analysed 1263 articles with tobacco content published in 187 Missouri newspapers in the year before the election. Articles were coded for general and tobacco-related characteristics including article type (news story, editorial, letter to the editor), tobacco control position (pro, neutral, anti) and article theme (economic, health, political). Most articles were news stories (73.6%) and pro-tobacco control (63.8%). The proportion of anti-tobacco control articles increased significantly (chi(2)=104.9, p<0.001) the month before the election, driven by an increase in economically themed articles. Economic articles were published more often in counties with less voter support for the tax (F=5.68, p<0.01). Finally, tobacco control position varied significantly across article types (chi(2)=148.3, p<0.01), with letters to the editor being anti-tobacco control most often. The media have a critical role in promoting public health goals and presenting health issues which influences formation of health policies. Tobacco control advocates must consider public opinion, opposition pressure, timing and themes in tobacco-related media coverage when promoting policy change.

Enalapril alters expression of key growth factors in experimental diabetic retinopathy. Angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), erythropoietin, and angiopoietin play important roles in the development of diabetic retinopathy. However, the suppression of a single factor does not inhibit angiogenesis completely. This study simultaneously evaluated the expression of several angiogenic factors in the retinas of diabetes-induced rats and determined the effects of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (enalapril) on the expression of angiogenic factors. Diabetes was chemically induced by injecting 14 of 21 Sprague-Dawley rats with streptozotocin. After induction of diabetes, enalapril (10 mg/kg) was administered orally to seven rats. The rats were divided into normal, diabetes mellitus (DM), and enalapril-treated groups (each group, n = 7). The eyeballs were removed at 8 weeks after the induction of diabetes, and the retinal expression of VEGF, the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3/5, erythropoietin, and angiopoietin were examined using immunohistochemistry, RT-PCR, and Western blotting. RT-PCR revealed that the expression of VEGF, VEGF receptors, STAT3, erythropoietin, erythropoietin receptor, STAT5, angiopoietin 2, and Tie2 mRNA increased in the DM group, whereas angiopoietin 1 expression decreased. The enalapril-treated group showed no increase in mRNA expression of angiogenic factors. Immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting showed that the expression of VEGF, STAT3, and erythropoietin receptor proteins increased in the DM group but not in the enalapril-treated group. Erythropoietin and angiopoietin proteins were not detected by immunohistochemical staining or Western blotting. STAT5 protein expression was detected only in the DM group using immunohistochemical staining and Western blotting. The mRNA expression of the angiogenic factors VEGF, erythropoietin, and angiopoietin 2 increased in the DM group but not in the enalapril-treated group. In contrast, angiopoietin 1 mRNA expression decreased in the DM group. Enalapril treatment prevented increased angiogenic factor levels in the retinas of experimentally induced diabetic rats.

Inhibition of IkB kinase and NF-kappaB by a novel synthetic compound SK 2009. The NF-kappaB family of transcription factors plays an important role in determining cell survival during immune, inflammatory, and stress responses. NF-kappaB activity is frequently deregulated in human cancers and is implicated in the resistance of tumor cells to diverse anticancer agents. We studied the effects of novel analogs of precursors of the natural product simplactone (A) on the activity of IkB kinase and NF-kappaB. Screening of six compounds for the ability to inhibit TNF-induced NF-kappaB activity revealed that compound SK2009 was the most potent of these compounds in suppressing NF-kappaB activation in KBM-5 leukemic cells. Further characterization of SK2009 indicates that this newly synthesized molecule can suppress TNF-induced IkappaBalpha kinase activation and inhibit the expression of three NF-kappaB-dependent gene products, cyclin D1, Bcl-2, and VEGF, in these cells.

Assessment of the validity of the guideline for integrated management of adult and adolescent illnesses on HIV patients in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. . The syndromic approach is a tool by which the case management services can be easily provided in health centers with resource-poor settings at the first contact. The World Health Organization has recommended syndromic management guidelines to be used by first level facility health workers in resource-poor settings to scale-up antiretroviral therapy (ART). However, the validity of the guideline was not assessed To assess the validity of acute care guideline for Integrated Management of Adult and Adolescent Illness (IMAI) against etiologic and/or clinical approach. The study was conducted in three governmental health centers in Addis Ababa between March and May 2006. Each patient was examined by IMAI trained nurses and then by physicians using the etiologic and/or clinical approach in two different rooms. Specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated, by taking the decisions made through the etiologic or clinical approach as a gold standard. A total of 648 clients who were eligible for enrolment during the study period were included in the study. Compared to the diagnosis made by physicians the sensitivity of the guideline for URTI, pneumonia and tuberculosis were found to be 100%, 100%, and 87.5% respectively. The specificity of the guideline for the mentioned disorders was 92.1%, 96.6% and 100% respectively. Among patients with diarrhea the sensitivity and specificity of the guideline for dysentery were 92.5% and 100% respectively. The guideline was found to be 60% sensitive and 100% specific for sever anemia in patients with pallor and 100% sensitivity and 60% specificity for acute anemia. The findings of the study suggested that syndromic management of the mentioned diseases at the health center level is possible. However, the performance of the guideline was very poor regarding level of severity in pneumonia, anemia and dehydration. Therefore, the tested guideline needs further modifications with emphasis on their ability in delineating the level of severity.

Short-term effects of online hemodiafiltration on phosphate control: a result from the randomized controlled Convective Transport Study (CONTRAST). Hyperphosphatemia is an independent risk factor for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients. Phosphate control often is unsuccessful using conventional dialysis therapies. Short-term analysis of a secondary outcome of an ongoing randomized controlled trial. 493 (84%) consecutive patients from 589 patients included in the Convective Transport Study (CONTRAST) by January 2009 from 26 centers in 3 countries. Online hemodiafiltration (HDF) versus continuation of low-flux HD. Differences in change from baseline to 6 months in phosphate levels and proportion of patients reaching phosphate treatment targets (phosphate < or = 5.5 mg/dL). Phosphate, use of phosphate-binding agents, and proportion of patients achieving treatment targets at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Phosphate levels decreased from 5.18 +/- 0.10 (SE) mg/dL at baseline to 4.87 +/- 0.10 mg/dL at 6 months in HDF patients (P < 0.001) and were stable in HD patients (5.10 +/- 0.10 mg/dL at baseline and 5.03 +/- 0.10 mg/dL after 6 months; P = 0.5). The difference in change in phosphate levels between HD and HDF patients (B = -0.24; 95% CI, -0.52 to 0.03; P = 0.08) increased after adjustment for phosphate-binder use (B = -0.36; 95% CI, -0.65 to -0.06; P = 0.02). The proportion of patients reaching phosphate treatment targets increased from 64% to 74% in HDF patients and was stable in HD patients (66% and 66%); the difference between groups reached statistical significance (P = 0.04). Nutritional parameters and residual renal function were similar in both treatment groups. Only predialysis serum phosphate levels were measured; phosphate clearance could therefore not be calculated. HDF may help improve phosphate control. Whether this contributes to improved clinical outcome remains to be established.

The relation between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth and PM2.5 over the United States: a geographical comparison by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regions. Aerosol optical depth (AOD) acquired from satellite measurements demonstrates good correlation with particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 microm (PM2.5) in some regions of the United States and has been used for monitoring and nowcasting air quality over the United States. This work investigates the relation between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD and PM2.5 over the 10 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-defined geographic regions in the United States on the basis of a 2-yr (2005-2006) match-up dataset of MODIS AOD and hourly PM2.5 measurements. The AOD retrievals demonstrate a geographical and seasonal variation in their relation with PM2.5. Good correlations are mostly observed over the eastern United States in summer and fall. The southeastern United States has the highest correlation coefficients at more than 0.6. The southwestern United States has the lowest correlation coefficient of approximately 0.2. The seasonal regression relations derived for each region are used to estimate the PM2.5 from AOD retrievals, and it is shown that the estimation using this method is more accurate than that using a fixed ratio between PM2.5 and AOD. Two versions of AOD from Terra (v4.0.1 and v5.2.6) are also compared in terms of the inversion methods and screening algorithms. The v5.2.6 AOD retrievals demonstrate better correlation with PM2.5 than v4.0.1 retrievals, but they have much less coverage because of the differences in the cloud-screening algorithm.

Lysosomal destabilization and cathepsin B contributes for cytochrome c release and caspase activation in embelin-induced apoptosis. XIAP is an important antiapoptotic protein capable of conferring resistance to cancer cells. Embelin, the small molecular inhibitor of XIAP, possesses wide spectrum of biological activities with strong inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B and downstream antiapoptotic genes. However, the mechanism of its cell death induction is not known. Our studies using colon cancer cells lacking p53 and Bax suggest that both lysosomes and mitochondria are prominent targets of embelin-induced cell death. Embelin induced cell-cycle arrest in G(1) phase through p21, downstream of p53. In the absence of p21, the cells are sensitized to death in a Bax-dependent manner. The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential induced by embelin was independent of Bax and p53, but lysosomal integrity loss was strongly influenced by the presence of p53 but not by Bax. Lysosomal role was further substantiated by enhanced cathepsin B activity noticed in embelin-treated cells. p53-dependent lysosomal destabilization and cathepsin B activation contribute for increased sensitivity of p21-deficient cells to embelin with enhanced caspase 9 and caspase 3 activation. Cathepsin B inhibitor reduced cell death and cytochrome c release in embelin-treated cells indicating lysosomal pathway as the upstream of mitochondrial death signaling. Deficiency of cell-cycle arrest machinery renders cells more sensitive to embelin with enhanced lysosomal destabilization and caspase processing emphasizing its potential therapeutic importance to address clinical drug resistance.

Ecological adaptation determines functional mammalian olfactory subgenomes. The ability to smell is governed by the largest gene family in mammalian genomes, the olfactory receptor (OR) genes. Although these genes are well annotated in the finished human and mouse genomes, we still do not understand which receptors bind specific odorants or how they fully function. Previous comparative studies have been taxonomically limited and mostly focused on the percentage of OR pseudogenes within species. No study has investigated the adaptive changes of functional OR gene families across phylogenetically and ecologically diverse mammals. To determine the extent to which OR gene repertoires have been influenced by habitat, sensory specialization, and other ecological traits, to better understand the functional importance of specific OR gene families and thus the odorants they bind, we compared the functional OR gene repertoires from 50 mammalian genomes. We amplified more than 2000 OR genes in aquatic, semi-aquatic, and flying mammals and coupled these data with 48,000 OR genes from mostly terrestrial mammals, extracted from genomic projects. Phylogenomic, Bayesian assignment, and principle component analyses partitioned species by ecotype (aquatic, semi-aquatic, terrestrial, flying) rather than phylogenetic relatedness, and identified OR families important for each habitat. Functional OR gene repertoires were reduced independently in the multiple origins of aquatic mammals and were significantly divergent in bats. We reject recent neutralist views of olfactory subgenome evolution and correlate specific OR gene families with physiological requirements, a preliminary step toward unraveling the relationship between specific odors and respective OR gene families.

Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand 1 (TRAIL1) enhances the transition of red blood cells from the larval to adult type during metamorphosis in Xenopus.

Garcinia xanthochymus Benzophenones Promote Hyphal Apoptosis and Potentiate Activity of Fluconazole against Candida albicans Biofilms. Xanthochymol and garcinol, isoprenylated benzophenones purified from Garcinia xanthochymus fruits, showed multiple activities against Candida albicans biofilms. Both compounds effectively prevented emergence of fungal germ tubes and were also cytostatic, with MICs of 1 to 3 Î¼M. The compounds therefore inhibited development of hyphae and subsequent biofilm maturation. Xanthochymol treatment of developing and mature biofilms induced cell death. In early biofilm development, killing had the characteristics of apoptosis, including externalization of phosphatidyl serine and DNA fragmentation, as evidenced by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) fluorescence. These activities resulted in failure of biofilm maturation and hyphal death in mature biofilms. In mature biofilms, xanthochymol and garcinol caused the death of biofilm hyphae, with 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) of 30 to 50 Î¼M. Additionally, xanthochymol-mediated killing was complementary with fluconazole against mature biofilms, reducing the fluconazole EC50 from >1,024 Î¼g/ml to 13 Î¼g/ml. Therefore, xanthochymol has potential as an adjuvant for antifungal treatments as well as in studies of fungal apoptosis. 

[Acute T cells lymphoblastic leukemia with a t(1;19)(q23;p13) and E2A-PBX1 in an adult: one case report and literature review]. To report a case of T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with t(1;19)(q23;pl3) and E2A-PBX1 fusion gene, which is a characteristic translocation of childhood B cell ALL (B-ALL). The chromosome, karyotype, immunophenotype and mRNA for fusion gene of the leukemic cells were examined by cytogenetic analysis, flow cytometry (FCM) and reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR), respectively. The cytogenetic karyotype of the patient was 47, XY, 9p+, 15p+, 17q-, der(19), t(1;19)(q23;pl3)\[5\]/46, XY\[15\], and E2A-PBX1 was positive. The leukemic cells expressed T cell markers. The patient was induced with hyper CVAD regimen (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, adriamycin, and dexamethasone), and achieved complete remission with normal cytogenetic karyotype 46 XY\[10\], and negative E2A-PBX1. t(1;19)E2A-PBX1(+) can be implicated in adult T-ALL, besides childhood B-ALL.


Mucormycosis infection of the lacrimal sac.

cGMP production in bacteria. Production of cGMP in bacteria has been studied since the early 1970s. From the beginning on it proved to be a challenging topic. In Escherichia coli the cGMP levels were two orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding cAMP levels. Furthermore, no specific cGMP receptor protein was identified in the bacterium and a physiological role of cGMP in the bacterium was not substantiated. Consequently in 1977, compelling evidence was given that cGMP is a by-product of E. coli adenylate cyclase in vivo. This may be the reason why also work on cGMP in other bacteria like Bacillus licheniformis and Caulobacter crescentus was not pursued any further. However, recent study on cGMP and guanylate cyclase in the cyanobacterium Synechocysis PCC 6803 brought cGMP signaling in bacteria back to attention. In Synechocystis cGMP levels are of similar magnitude as those of cAMP and deletion of the cya2 gene markedly reduced the amount of cGMP without affecting cAMP. A few months ago the Cya2 gene product has been biochemically and structurally characterized. It behaves as a specific guanylate cyclase in vitro and a single amino acid substitution transforms the enzyme into a specific adenylate cyclase. These data point toward the existence of a true bacterial cGMP-signaling pathway, which needs to be explored and established by future experiments.

Neuropathologic correlates of regional brain volumes in a community cohort of older adults. The objective of this work was 2-fold: to generate macrostructural brain signatures of age-related neuropathologies in a community cohort of older adults and to determine the contribution of brain macrostructure to the variation in antemortem cognition after accounting for the contributions of neuropathologies and demographics. Cerebral hemispheres from 165 participants of 2 cohort studies of aging were imaged with magnetic resonance imaging ex vivo (mean age at death = 90 years; standard deviation = 6 years). The volumes of white matter and 42 gray matter regions were measured. The same hemispheres also underwent neuropathologic examination. Alzheimer's disease pathology was negatively associated with volumes of mainly temporal, frontal, and parietal gray matter regions, and with total white matter volume (p < 0.05, false discovery rate-corrected). A negative association was also detected between hippocampal sclerosis and volumes of the hippocampus, as well as other temporal and frontal gray matter regions (p < 0.05, false discovery rate-corrected). The volume of mainly medial temporal lobe regions explained an additional 5%-6% of the variation in antemortem cognition, above and beyond what was explained by neuropathologies and demographics.

Effect of meal ingestion on ileocolonic and colonic transit in health and irritable bowel syndrome. Postprandial symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have been associated with increased bowel contractility. To compare ileocolonic and colonic responses to feeding in health and IBS. We prospectively analyzed data from separate research trials in 122 IBS patients and 41 healthy volunteers. Ileocolonic transit (ICT) was evaluated before (colonic filling [CF]3h) and immediately after (CF4 h) a standard lunch at 3 h 45 min, and 2 h thereafter. The colonic geometric center (GC) was calculated 2 h (GC6 h) after lunch ingested at 4 h (GC4 h) and directly after (GC8 h) a standard dinner ingested at 7 h 45 min. ICT immediately after eating was higher in IBS diarrhea predominant (IBS-D) patients than in the healthy cohort (23.1 +/- 2.4 vs. 17.5 +/- 2.8%, P = 0.059). ICT 2 h after lunch was similar between groups (P = 0.55). There was significant overall group differences in colonic transit 2 h post-lunch (P = 0.045), particularly in the IBS constipation predominant (IBS-C; GC6-GC4, delta 0.29 +/- 0.08) patients versus healthy volunteers (delta 0.56 +/- 0.12 GC units). After feeding, ICT is increased in IBS-D, whereas colonic transit is blunted in IBS-C.

Mediators of target organ damage in hypertension: focus on obesity associated factors and inflammation. Arterial hypertension represents a major cardiovascular epidemic in the developed and developing world. Projections out to 2025 suggest that up to 50% of the adult populations of Western countries will meet standard guideline definitions of hypertension and thus require therapeutic intervention both non-pharmacological or pharmacological. Hyper-tension is also a component of many other major comorbidities contributing to cardiovascular disease burden. These include obesity, the metabolic syndrome, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Downstream consequences initially presenting as target organ damage of various degrees include coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, nephropathy and chronic heart failure. Although elevated blood pressure per se is undoubtedly the major factor contributing to hypertensive target organ damage there is clear evidence that other mediators are also crucially involved in the transition from a healthy to a diseased state of target organs in the clinical setting of elevated blood pressure. This has obvious consequences for a multifactorial approach aimed not only at achieving target blood pressure levels but also at preventing the development or the progression of target organ damage in order to optimally reduce the overall cardiovascular risk for patients. The epidemic we are currently facing in regards to obesity is closely associated with the expected increase in the prevalence of hypertension. A closer look into the role of obesity and associated factors for the rise in blood pressure and their role in target organ damage is therefore inevitable. This review will thus focus on the clinically important aspects of target organ damage associated with hypertension, particularly obesity related hypertension, and the evidence for the involvement of neurohormonal activation and inflammatory pathways.

A comparative effectiveness evaluation of percutaneous adhesiolysis and epidural steroid injections in managing lumbar post surgery syndrome: a randomized, equivalence controlled trial. Speculated causes of post lumbar surgery syndrome include epidural fibrosis, acquired stenosis, and facet joint pain among other causes. Even though fluoroscopically directed caudal epidural injections and facet joint interventions are effective in some patients, others continue to suffer with chronic persistent pain. Percutaneous adhesiolysis with target delivery of medications has been demonstrated to be effective in these patients. However, the evidence for percutaneous adhesiolysis in managing post surgery syndrome has been questioned, coupled with a paucity of controlled trials. A randomized, equivalence, controlled trial. An interventional pain management practice, a specialty referral center, a private practice setting in the United States. To evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous epidural adhesiolysis in patients with chronic low back and lower extremity pain in post surgery syndrome and compare with fluoroscopically directed caudal epidural steroid injections. Patients were randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: Group I (60 patients) receiving caudal epidural injections with catheterization up to S3 with local anesthetic, steroids, and 0.9% sodium chloride solution serving as the control group, and Group II (60 patients) receiving percutaneous adhesiolysis with targeted delivery of lidocaine, 10% hypertonic sodium chloride solution, and non-particulate Betamethasone serving as the intervention group. Randomization was performed by computer-generated random allocation sequence by simple randomization. Multiple outcome measures were utilized including the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS), the Oswestry Disability Index 2.0 (ODI), employment status, and opioid intake with assessment at 3, 6, and 12 months post treatment. Significant pain relief was described as 50% or more, whereas significant improvement in the disability score was defined as a reduction of 40% or more. Significant pain relief (>or= 50%) and functional status improvement was recorded in 73% of patients in Group II versus 12% in Group I (P < 0.001). The average procedures per year were 3.5 with an average total relief of 42 out of 52 weeks in Group II and 2.2 procedures with total relief per year of 13 weeks in Group I (P < 0.001). The results of this study are limited by potentially inadequate double blinding, by the lack of a placebo group, and the preliminary report of one-year follow-up. Percutaneous adhesiolysis in chronic function-limiting, recalcitrant low back pain in post lumbar surgery syndrome demonstrated effectiveness in 73% of the patients.

Indicators of a more complicated clinical course for pediatric patients with retropharyngeal abscess. Determine clinical signs or symptoms associated with a more complicated clinical course in patients with retropharyngeal abscesses (RPAs). Retrospective chart review at a tertiary care level Children's hospital. Main Outcome Measures Age, presenting signs and symptoms, laboratory tests, imaging results, antibiotic therapy, surgical approach, pathogens isolated, and duration of hospitalization were evaluated to determine any factors associated with a more complicated clinical course (CCC). Fifteen of one hundred thirty pediatric patients with RPA were identified with a complicated clinical course (CCC). Eight of the fifteen required more than one procedure before the abscess resolved. Patients with multiple abscess sites had a statistically significantly greater chance of requiring multiple procedures to clear the infections (p<0.001). Another seven presented with airway obstruction requiring an admission into the Pediatric Intensive Care (PICU) and/or intubation. All the patients requiring admission to the PICU presented with signs or symptoms of airway obstruction compared to ten of the one hundred fifteen patients (8.7%) with a smooth clinical course (SCC) (p<0.001). Five patients from the CCC group required a bronchoscopy to secure the airway; seven patients required intubation following incision and drainage of the abscess for an average of 5+/-3 days. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups with respect to pathogens isolated, or antibiotics used. Our study suggests that patients with a CCC are more likely to present with airway obstruction or multiple abscess sites than patients with SCC.


Wound-related pain: features, assessment and treatment.

Overview of genotoxic impurities in pharmaceutical development. This symposium focuses on the management of genotoxic impurities in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals. Recent developments in both Europe and United States require sponsors of new drug applications to develop processes to control the risks of potential genotoxic impurities. Genotoxic impurities represent a special case relative to the International Conference on Harmonisation Q3A/Q3B guidances, because genotoxicity tests used to qualify the drug substance may not be sufficient to demonstrate safety of a potentially genotoxic impurity. The default risk management approach for a genotoxic impurity is the threshold of toxicological concern unless a more specific risk characterization is appropriate. The symposium includes descriptions of industry examples where impurities are introduced and managed in the synthesis of a pharmaceutical. It includes recent regulatory developments such as the "staged threshold of toxicological concern" when administration is of short duration (eg, during clinical trials).

Revision endoscopic stapler Zenker's diverticulotomy. Endoscopic stapler diverticulotomy (ESD) has become an accepted primary treatment for Zenker's diverticulum (ZD). Recurrence of symptoms after surgical treatment of ZD is not uncommon, and traditionally patients with recurrent symptomatic ZD were referred to revision surgery by the transcervical Zenker's diverticulectomy approach. Our objective was to evaluate the technical feasibility, safety and effectiveness of revision endoscopic stapler diverticulotomy (RESD) for recurrent ZD. A case series with chart review study conducted in a tertiary referral center. The records of all patients who underwent ESD at our institute between 2002 and 2013 were retrieved and those who underwent RESD were identified and screened for primary surgical history, symptoms of recurrent ZD, time to recurrence, intraoperative and postoperative RESD course, complications and symptom resolution. The surgical history and outcome results of RESD and primary ESD (PESD) patients were compared. Eighty-nine ESDs were performed. Twenty were RESDs for recurrent ZD, and 69 were PESDs. Nine RESDs were performed for recurrent ZD after transcervical Zenker's diverticulectomy, 10 RESDs for recurrent ZD after ESD, and one initial surgical approach was unknown. The mean time from first operation for ZD to RESD was 4.7Â years. The average RESD surgery time and hospital stay were 21.4Â min and 2.8Â days, respectively. Endoscopic stapling of the ZD was feasible in 19 of 20 RESDs. Relief of symptoms without recurrence was achieved after 18 RESDs. Four RESD patients experienced minor postoperative complications. There were no significant differences in operative time, technical feasibility, hospital stay and complication rate between the RESD and PESD groups (PÂ >Â .05). RESD for ZD is technically feasible, safe and effective. The results are comparable to those of PESD.

Automated swimming activity monitor for examining temporal patterns of toxicant effects on individual Daphnia magna. Aquatic pollutants are often biologically active at low concentrations and impact on biota in combination with other abiotic stressors. Traditional toxicity tests may not detect these effects, and there is a need for sensitive high-throughput methods for detecting sublethal effects. We have evaluated an automated infra-red (IR) light-based monitor for recording the swimming activity of Daphnia magna to establish temporal patterns of toxicant effects on an individual level. Activity was recorded for 48 h and the sensitivity of the monitor was evaluated by exposing D. magna to the reference chemicals K2 Cr2 O7 at 15, 20 and 25 Â°C and 2,4-dichlorophenol at 20 Â°C. Significant effects (P < 0.001) of toxicant concentrations, exposure time and incubation temperatures were observed. At 15 Â°C, the swimming activity remained unchanged for 48 h at sublethal concentrations of K2 Cr2 O7 whereas activity at 20 and 25 Â°C was more biphasic with decreases in activity occurring after 12-18 h. A similar biphasic pattern was observed after 2,4-dichlorophenol exposure at 20 Â°C. EC50 values for 2,4-dichlorophenol and K2 Cr2 O7 determined from automated recording of swimming activity showed increasing toxicity with time corresponding to decreases in EC50 of 0.03-0.07 mg l(-1) h(-1) . EC50 values determined after 48 h were comparable or lower than EC50 values based on visual inspection according to ISO 6341. The results demonstrated that the swimming activity monitor is capable of detecting sublethal behavioural effects that are toxicant and temperature dependent. The method allows EC values to be established at different time points and can serve as a high-throughput screening tool in toxicity testing. Copyright Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

[Thrombotic microangiopathies]. The thrombotic microangiopathic diseases, which include acquired and congenital TTP and HUS, are most frequently acute disease entities. Untreated, these diseases are associated with a lethal course in many cases. Deficiency of the von Willebrand cleaving enzyme, ADAMTS13, is a decisive pathophysiological defect in most cases of thrombotic microangiopathic diseases. Early recognition and a secure distinction from other conditions that resemble TMA diseases is essential in order to institute adequate treatment and to obtain a favourable outcome in terms of both survival and development of serious sequelae.

A biophysical model for modulation frequency encoding in the cochlear nucleus.

Attention and biased competition in multi-voxel object representations. The biased-competition theory accounts for attentional effects at the single-neuron level: It predicts that the neuronal response to simultaneously-presented stimuli is a weighted average of the response to isolated stimuli, and that attention biases the weights in favor of the attended stimulus. Perception, however, relies not on single neurons but on larger neuronal populations. The responses of such populations are in part reflected in large-scale multivoxel fMRI activation patterns. Because the pooling of neuronal responses into blood-oxygen-level-dependent signals is nonlinear, fMRI effects of attention need not mirror those observed at the neuronal level. Thus, to bridge the gap between neuronal responses and human perception, it is fundamental to understand attentional influences in large-scale multivariate representations of simultaneously-presented objects. Here, we ask how responses to simultaneous stimuli are combined in multivoxel fMRI patterns, and how attention affects the paired response. Objects from four categories were presented singly, or in pairs such that each category was attended, unattended, or attention was divided between the two. In a multidimensional voxel space, the response to simultaneously-presented categories was well described as a weighted average. The weights were biased toward the preferred category in category-selective regions. Consistent with single-unit reports, attention shifted the weights by approximately 30% in favor of the attended stimulus. These findings extend the biased-competition framework to the realm of large-scale multivoxel brain activations.


Dexmedetomidine-associated bradycardia progressing to pulseless electrical activity: case report and review of the literature.

A fibre-optic catheter-tip force sensor with MRI compatibility: a feasibility study. This paper presents the development of a low-cost, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) compatible fibre-optic sensor for integration with catheters allowing the detection of contact forces between blood vessel walls and the catheter tip. Three plastic optical-fibres are aligned inside a plastic catheter in a circular pattern. A reflector is attached to a separate small part of the catheter tip, which is connected with a small deformable material to the aligned optical-fibres. In this manner a force at the catheter tip leads to a deformation of the elastic material and thus a modulation of the light yields, this is sent and received through the optical-fibres. An electronic circuit amplifies the retrieved light signal and the output voltage is used to classify the forces on the tip. The materials used are of the shelf and have a low magnetic susceptibility making this sensor fully MRI-compatible and inexpensive. Preliminary, experimental results demonstrated good force linearity in static loading and unloading conditions. The sensor was also tested in an artificial blood artery showing good dynamic response.

Diabetes-associated changes and role of N epsilon-(carboxymethyl)lysine in big ET-1-induced coronary vasoconstriction. Using perfused hearts from streptozotocin-induced long-term diabetic rats, we studied the coronary vasoconstrictor effect of the endothelin-1 (ET-1) precursor big ET-1 and also whether this response was modulated by N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML; a representative advanced glycation end product that is implicated in the pathogenesis of diabetic vasculopathy). The big ET-1-induced vasoconstriction (a) developed more rapidly (i.e., was greater in the first 30 min) in the diabetic group than in the age-matched controls, and (b) in each group was largely suppressed by phosphoramidon [nonselective endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE)/neutral endopeptidase (NEP) inhibitor] or CGS35066 (selective ECE inhibitor), but not by thiorphan (selective NEP inhibitor). The ET-1 release occurring after treatment with big ET-1, which was greater in diabetic coronary arteries than in the controls, was reduced by CGS35066. The dose-response curve for ET-1 was shifted to the left in the diabetics, so that at some lower doses of ET-1 the vasoconstriction was greater than in the controls. CML enhanced big ET-1- or ET-1-induced vasoconstriction in the controls, but not in the diabetics. Finally, the plasma level of CML was higher in diabetic than in control rats. These findings suggest (a) that the increased responsiveness to big ET-1 shown by diabetic coronary arteries may be attributable both to a more rapid conversion of big ET-1 to ET-1 (by ECE), allowing it to exert its contractile activity, and to an increased vascular sensitivity to ET-1, and (b) that CML may be at least partly responsible for the diabetes-associated enhancement of big ET-1-mediated coronary vasoconstriction.

Sulphonated cobalt phthalocyanine-MCM-41: an active photocatalyst for degradation of 2,4-dichlorophenol. The photocatalytic activity of sulphonated cobalt phthalocyanine immobilized onto MCM-41 was investigated for decomposition of 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP) in aqueous solutions. Immobilization of anion sulpho-cobalt phthalocyanine to the walls of MCM-41 was performed by pre-anchorage of 3-(aminopropyl)-triethoxysilane (APTES) onto MCM-41 via post-synthesis method. X-ray diffraction, nitrogen physisorption, diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray and FT-IR methods were used to characterize the product. Photocatalytic efficiency of the prepared catalyst for degradation of 2,4-DCP was tested under illumination of UV-A and visible light. The results obtained reveal that the photocatalyst is very active in degradation of 2,4-DCP. The photodegradation process is completed within 3h using a dose of 0.6g/L of the catalyst under UV irradiation. The reactions follow a pseudo-first-order kinetics and the observed rate constant values change with 2,4-DCP concentrations. The reproducibility of the catalyst was tested. The reaction intermediates were identified by gas chromatoghraphy-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technique.

Effect of dust exposure and nitrogen oxides on lung function parameters of German coalminers: a longitudinal study applying GEE regression 1974-1998. Workplace limits for dust and nitrogen oxides are under review in Germany and the EU. We conducted a study on German coal miners to determine the effects of exposure on lung function. Longitudinal inception cohort study (1974-1998) on miners who began working underground at two coal mines between 1974 and 1979. We determined the number of shifts worked underground, the exposure to coal mine dust, quartz dust, nitrogen oxides (NO, NO(2)), smoking behavior, and three lung function parameters (FVC, FEV(1), FEV(1)/FVC). General estimation equation (GEE) models were fitted. 1,369 miners worked an average 3,017 shifts (S) underground. The mean respirable coal mine dust concentration was 1.89 mg/m(3) (quartz: 0.067 mg/m(3)), and the nitrogen oxide concentrations were 0.58 ppm (NO) and 0.007 ppm (NO(2)). On average, 9 measurements of lung function were available per miner. Compared to reference values, the findings were unexceptionable (103, 101, and 99%) on average. GEE-regression models did not reveal detrimental dust exposure effects. Nitrogen oxides (NO (x) = NO + NO(2)) showed small but clearly insignificant effects on lung function: delta FVC = -0.0008 ml/(220 ppmS), P = 0.86, delta FEV(1) = -0.003 ml/(220 ppmS), P = 0.50 and delta FEV(1)%FVC = -0.07%/(220 ppmS), P = 0.22. The effect of dust exposure on lung function described in older British and American coal miner studies was not confirmed. This can be explained partly by differences in methods (here: longitudinal studies, no prior exposure), but also by lower dust levels. NO (x) exposures showed no relevant influence on lung function-a result confirming findings from British coal mining.

Polymer multilayer films obtained by electrochemically catalyzed click chemistry. We report the covalent layer-by-layer construction of polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films by using an efficient electrochemically triggered Sharpless click reaction. The click reaction is catalyzed by Cu(I) which is generated in situ from Cu(II) (originating from the dissolution of CuSO(4)) at the electrode constituting the substrate of the film. The film buildup can be controlled by the application of a mild potential inducing the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) in the absence of any reducing agent or any ligand. The experiments were carried out in an electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance cell which allows both to apply a controlled potential on a gold electrode and to follow the mass deposited on the electrode through the quartz crystal microbalance. Poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) modified with either alkyne (PAA(Alk)) or azide (PAA(Az)) functions grafted onto the PAA backbone through ethylene glycol arms were used to build the PEM films. Construction takes place on gold electrodes whose potentials are more negative than a critical value, which lies between -70 and -150 mV vs Ag/AgCl (KCl sat.) reference electrode. The film thickness increment per bilayer appears independent of the applied voltage as long as it is more negative than the critical potential, but it depends upon Cu(II) and polyelectrolyte concentrations in solution and upon the reduction time of Cu(II) during each deposition step. An increase of any of these latter parameters leads to an increase of the mass deposited per layer. For given buildup conditions, the construction levels off after a given number of deposition steps which increases with the Cu(II) concentration and/or the Cu(II) reduction time. A model based on the diffusion of Cu(II) and Cu(I) ions through the film and the dynamics of the polyelectrolyte anchoring on the film, during the reduction period of Cu(II), is proposed to explain the major buildup features.

Impact of a contemplative end-of-life training program: being with dying. Health care professionals report a lack of skills in the psychosocial and spiritual aspects of caring for dying people and high levels of moral distress, grief, and burnout. To address these concerns, the "Being with Dying: Professional Training Program in Contemplative End-of-Life Care" (BWD) was created. The premise of BWD, which is based on the development of mindfulness and receptive attention through contemplative practice, is that cultivating stability of mind and emotions enables clinicians to respond to others and themselves with compassion. This article describes the impact of BWD on the participants. Ninety-five BWD participants completed an anonymous online survey; 40 completed a confidential open-ended telephone interview. Four main themes-the power of presence, cultivating balanced compassion, recognizing grief, and the importance of self-care-emerged in the interviews and were supported in the survey data. The interviewees considered BWD's contemplative and reflective practices meaningful, useful, and valuable and reported that BWD provided skills, attitudes, behaviors, and tools to change how they worked with the dying and bereaved. The quality of presence has the potential to transform the care of dying people and the caregivers themselves. Cultivating this quality within themselves and others allows clinicians to explore alternatives to exclusively intellectual, procedural, and task-oriented approaches when caring for dying people. BWD provides a rare opportunity to engage in practices and methods that cultivate the stability of mind and emotions that may facilitate compassionate care of dying patients, families, and caregivers.

[Adaptive "3R" De-Noising Algorithm Based on Near Infrared Bi-Spectrum]. Adaptive de-noising algorithm is proposed based on transmission spectrum and absorption spectrum of near infrared. Near infrared transmission spectrum and absorption spectrum collected synchronously are decomposed into intrinsic mode functions by ensemble empirical mode decomposition; the intrinsic mode function is a single frequency component. Correlations between intrinsic mode functions and transmission spectrum, absorption spectrum were calculated, and the correlation between intrinsic mode functions of transmission spectrum and absorption spectrum was also computed. The results show that the intrinsic mode function with minimum correlation coefficient should be noise component. The self-correlation of this intrinsic mode function was analyzed to judge whether the intrinsic mode function is noise. IF the self-correlation is very large at the midpoint and is zero or very small at the other point of the spectrum, then the intrinsic mode function is noise component for judgment, based on which "3R" algorithm is named to judge whether the intrinsic mode function is noise component. Removing noise component, constructing spectral signal and circulating the previous decomposition was conducted, and the noise reduction process was ended until it did not meet the "3R" rule. To do experiment on the simulated spectrum with noise, the effect of de-noising with "3R" algorithm is better than EMD and EEMD low pass filter, and it is not so good as wavelet decomposition. In the real spectrum testing, the model was established between spectra treated by above methods with chlorophyll on three layers. BP neural network, and the model de-noised by "3R" method has the biggest correlation coefficient and prediction coefficient, but the smallest correction standard error and prediction standard error. "3R" method's effects on the peak position and peak intensity of spectrum are the smallest among the four kinds of de-noising methods. Experiments show that the "3R" algorithm based on bi-spectrum can be used for near infrared spectra de-nosing without presetting the number of iterations, there is no need to consider layers of decomposition, also no need of basis function, and the adaptability is very strong.

Smallpox vaccines: New formulations and revised strategies for vaccination. Smallpox has been eradicated but stockpiles of the causative infectious agent, variola virus, have been maintained over decades. Today, the threat of accidental or intentional poxvirus release is accompanied by the fact that the existing licensed smallpox vaccines cause rare but severe adverse reactions yet are the only products with approved efficacy against smallpox. New safer vaccines and new strategies of immunization are to be developed to fit to a scenario of emergency smallpox vaccination. However, we still lack knowledge about the pathogen and the mechanisms involved in acquiring protective immunity. Here, we review the history of smallpox vaccines and recent achievements in the development of highly efficacious and safer vaccines and vaccine applications. These include i) assessment of adequate animal models to study pathogenesis and protective immunity, ii) characterization of the immunity elicited by next generation vaccines, and (iii) the investigation of the requirements for rapidly protective vaccination.

Supplementation of a maternal low-protein diet in rat pregnancy with folic acid ameliorates programming effects upon feeding behaviour in the absence of disturbances to the methionine-homocysteine cycle. Maternal protein restriction in rat pregnancy is associated with altered feeding behaviour in later life. When allowed to self-select their diet, rats subject to prenatal undernutrition show an increased preference for fatty foods. The main aim of the present study was to evaluate the contribution of folic acid in the maternal diet to programming of appetite, since disturbances of the folate and methionine-homocysteine cycles have been suggested to impact upon epigenetic regulation of gene expression and hence programme long-term physiology and metabolism. Pregnant rats were fed diets containing either 9 or 18 % casein by weight, with folate provided at either 1 or 5 mg/kg diet. Adult male animals exposed to low protein (LP) in fetal life exhibited increased preference for high-fat food. Providing the higher level of folate in the maternal diet prevented this effect of LP, but offspring of rats fed 18 % casein diet with additional folate behaved in a similar manner to LP-exposed animals. Among day 20 gestation fetuses, it was apparent that both protein restriction and maternal folate supplementation could have adverse effects upon placental growth. Examination of methionine-homocysteine and folate cycle intermediates, tissue glutathione concentrations and expression of mRNA for methionine synthase, DNA methyltransferase 1 and methyltetrahydrofolate reductase revealed no gross disturbances of folate and one-carbon metabolism in either maternal or fetal tissue. The present findings indicated that any role for DNA methylation in programming of physiology is not related to major perturbations of folate metabolism, and is likely to be gene-specific rather than genome-wide.

A high-throughput liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method for the comparative determination of fluticasone propionate by reversed-phase liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis methods in pharmaceutical nasal sprays. A simple, specific, rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the analysis of fluticasone propionate (FP) in pharmaceutical formulations was developed and validated using deflazacort as internal standard (IS). The LC-MS/MS method was carried out on a C8 column (50 mm) with a mobile phase consisted of methanol : water (95 : 5, v/v) 100 mM formic acid-50 mM ammonium acetate (90 : 5 : 5, v/v/v). The mass spectrometry method was performed employing positive atmospheric pressure chemical ionization technique, operating in multiple reaction monitoring mode. The chromatographic separation was obtained within 1.5 min and it was linear in the concentration range of 10-1000 ng mL(-1). Moreover, method validation demonstrates acceptable results for the specificity, accuracy, precision and robustness. The proposed method was successfully applied for the quantitative analysis of FP nasal sprays and the results were compared to validated liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis methods with photodiode array detectors showing non-significant difference (P > 0.05).

[Efficiency of final irrigation of root canal in removal of smear layer]. A smear layer forms on the root canal walls as the consequence of root instrumentation. The smear layer formed in such a way considerably influences the quality of root obturation and endodontic treatment outcome. The aim of this study was to ultrastructurally analyse the surface of intracanal dentine after removal of the smear layer by the solution of doxycycline, citric acid and detergent Tween-80 (MTAD). The study involved 60 single-rooted, extracted, human teeth divided into four groups. All samples were instrumented by a step-back technique and manual K-files, and rinsed during instrumentation by 2% CHX and H2O2. The first group of samples was exclusively rinsed by CHX and H2O2; in the second group, besides using CHX and H2O2, MTAD solution was used for the final irrigation. The samples which were rinsed by distilled water (+ control) and the samples rinsed by 5.25% NaOCI and 17% Na EDTA (-control) served as control groups. All samples were observed under the scanning electronic microscope JEOL-JSM-5300. The coronary, middle and apex thirds of the radix region were analysed. The obtained results of the SEM analysis showed that the application of 2% chlorhexidine and hydrogen peroxide did not give clear dentine walls, and the smear layer could not be removed completely. The application of the same combination (CHX and H2O2), added by the final MTAD irrigation solution, led to the efficient removal of the smear layer, while the morphological structure of dentine surface remained unchanged. Statistical analysis showed that canal walls in the experimental group with MTAD as the final irrigation were significantly clearer compared to the control group (p < 0.001). Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that MTAD is an efficient solution for the final irrigation of the canal system.

An empirical study of choosing efficient discriminative seeds for oligonucleotide design. Oligonucleotide design is known as a time-consuming work in bioinformatics. In order to accelerate and be efficient the oligonucleotide design process, one of widely used approach is the prescreening unreliable regions using a hashing (or seeding) algorithm. Since the seeding algorithm is originally proposed to increase sensitivity for local alignment, the specificity should be considered as well as the sensitivity for the oligonucleotide design problem. However, a measure of evaluating the seeds regarding how adequate and efficient they are in the oligo design is not yet proposed. Here, we propose novel measures of evaluating the seeding algorithms based on the discriminability and the efficiency. To evaluate the proposed measures, we examine five seeding algorithms in oligonucleotide design. We carried out a series of experiments to compare the seeding algorithms. As the result, the spaced seed is recorded as the most efficient discriminative seed for oligo design. The performance of transition-constrained seed is slightly lower than the spaced seed. Because BLAT seeding algorithm and Vector seeding algorithm give poor scores in specificity and efficiency, we conclude that these algorithms are not adequate to design oligos. Consequently, we recommend spaced seeds or transition-constrained seeds with 15 approximately 18 weight in order to design oligos with the length of 50 mer. The empirical experiments in real biological data reveal that the recommended seeds show consequently good performance. We also propose a software package which enables the users to get the adequate seeds under their own experimental conditions. Our study is valuable to the two points. One is that our study can be applied to the oligo design programs in order to improve the performance by suggesting the experiment-specific seeds. The other is that our study is useful to improve the performance of the mapping assembly in the field of Next-Generation Sequencing. Our proposed measures are originally designed to be used for oligo design but we expect that our study will be helpful to the other genomic tasks.

Brief report: Under-representation of African americans in autism genetic research: a rationale for inclusion of subjects representing diverse family structures. African American children with autism are seriously under-represented in existing genetic registries and biomedical research studies of autism. We estimated the number of African American children with autism in the St. Louis region using CDC surveillance data and present the outcomes of a concerted effort to enroll approximately one-third of that population into either of two large national genetic autism registries. The results revealed that even after traditional barriers to research participation were addressed and all contacted families expressed a willingness to participate, 67% of the reachable families were disqualified from participation because of family structure alone. Comprehensive efforts-including expansion of eligibility to families of diverse structure-are warranted to facilitate the inclusion of African American children in biomedical research.


Serum C-reactive protein levels in normal-weight polycystic ovary syndrome.

Prognostic factors in histopathology of lung cancer. Carcinoma of the lung is the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and women. Prognosis correlates strongly with stage of disease at presentation and to some degree with the histological subtype of the tumor. Histological classifications of lung cancer were some what arbitrary and a matter of convenience. However, multiple lines of differentiation are often found within a single tumor, if it is sufficiently sampled. The new therapeutic approaches especially of non-small cell lung cancer place high demands on pathologists: a clear histological diagnosis with information on the predominant histological subtype is required, obtained by using additional immunohistochemical methods. Using molecular methods, predictive and prognostic factors for adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapies can be identified in tumor cells of small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Biological and molecular factors known in this regard include the epidermal growth factor family and its receptors, K-RAS mutations, neuroendocrine tumor differentiation, and nucleotide-excision-repair proteins (ERCC1 and RRM1). Thymidilate synthase is an interesting target for anticancer agents such as the antifolate pemetrexed. Given the aspect of individualized lung cancer therapy, the collective term small cell/non-small cell lung cancer introduced by the groups of Chuang in1984 and Thomas in 1993 can be regarded as no longer sufficient.

Brain temperature by Biosensor Imaging of Redundant Deviation in Shifts (BIRDS): comparison between TmDOTP5- and TmDOTMA-. Chemical shifts of complexes between paramagnetic lanthanide ions and macrocyclic chelates are sensitive to physiological variations (of temperature and/or pH). Here we demonstrate utility of a complex between thulium ion (Tm(3+)) and the macrocyclic chelate 1,4,7,10-tetramethyl 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetate (or DOTMA(4-)) for absolute temperature mapping in rat brain. The feasibility of TmDOTMA(-) is compared with that of another Tm(3+)-containing biosensor which is based on the macrocyclic chelate 1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane- 1,4,7,10-tetrakis(methylene phosphonate) (or DOTP(8-)). In general, the in vitro and in vivo results suggest that Biosensor Imaging of Redundant Deviation in Shifts (BIRDS) which originate from these agents (but exclude water) can provide temperature maps with good accuracy. While TmDOTP(5-) emanates three major distinct proton resonances which are differentially sensitive to temperature and pH, TmDOTMA(-) has a dominant pH-insensitive proton resonance from a -CH(3) group to allow higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) temperature assessment. Temperature (and pH) sensitivities of these resonances are practically identical at low (4.0T) and high (11.7T) magnetic fields and at nominal repetition times only marginal SNR loss is expected at the lower field. Since these resonances have extremely short relaxation times, high-speed chemical shift imaging (CSI) is needed to detect them. Repeated in vivo CSI scans with BIRDS demonstrate excellent measurement stability. Overall, results with TmDOTP(5-) and TmDOTMA(-) suggest that BIRDS can be reliably applied, either at low or high magnetic fields, for functional studies in rodents.


[Evaluation of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in mouse by molecular imaging of P-selectin with targeted contrast echocardiography].

Kinematic walking analysis on a new vehicle "Tread-Walk" with active velocity control of treadmill belt. The importance on walking for health is growing in elder dominated society. We have been developing a new mobility "Tread-Walk 1 (TW-1)" controlled by walking movement. The device uses active treadmill velocity control, which allows the user to walk on the treadmill at any desired velocity. In this paper, the walking movements on the TW-1 were kinematically analyzed and compared with the walking movements on a traditional constant-velocity treadmill and on flat ground. The results showed that the walking pattern on the TW-1 was somewhat similar to that on a constant-velocity treadmill and on flat ground; however, the flexion angle of the hip joint and the dorsiflexion and plantaflexion angles of the ankle joint during TW-1 walking were larger. It also was shown that the foot applied a stronger kicking force to the belt at toe-off and the foot clearance on the TW-1 was larger than that on the constant-velocity treadmill and on flat ground. Therefore, the walking patterns in the swing and stance phase on the TW-1 are little different. However, the walking movements based on the TW-1 active belt control are valuable from the viewpoints of motion training.

Chuanxiongzine relaxes isolated corpus cavernosum strips and raises intracavernous pressure in rabbits. It has been shown that there are many Chinese traditional herbals that can enhance sexual activity. Chuanxiongzine is a vasoactive ingredient that has been isolated and purified from Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort. In previous studies, it has been found that chuanxiongzine was effective in relaxing rabbit corpus cavernosum smooth muscle. We determined the effects of chuanxiongzine on relaxation of isolated corpus cavernosum strips in vitro and on increase of intracavernous pressure (ICP) in vivo in rabbits. Chuanxiongzine caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of phenylephrine precontracted isolated corpus cavernosum strips (EC(50) 1.58 x 10(-4) mol l(-1)), which were endothelium independent and NO independent. However, the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1-H-[1,2,4] oxadiazolo [4,3-a] quinoxalin-1-one significantly shifted the chuanxiongzine concentration-response relationship to the right. Although there was no significant difference in the level of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in isolated corpus cavernosum strips treated with chuanxiongzine or vehicle, chuanxiongzine caused a significant rise in the level of cGMP and cAMP in isolated corpus cavernosum strips pretreated with the activator of adenylyl cyclase forskolin and the source of NO sodium nitroprusside. In an in vivo study, chuanxiongzine dose-dependently raised ICP after the intracavernous injection of its cumulative doses (0.5, 1, 2 and 5 mg kg(-1)). The ICP increased from baseline to 19.1+/-3.7, 24.8+/-2.1, 30.2+/-4.8 and 39.7+/-6.1 mm Hg, respectively, and the duration of tumescence ranged from 8.5+/-2.8 to 22.9+/-7.3 min. Our results show that chuanxiongzine can relax isolated corpus cavernosum strips of rabbits in vitro and increase ICP of rabbits in vivo, which is neither endothelium dependent nor NO dependent, but may be partly mediated by the inhibition of cAMP phosphodiesterase or cGMP phosphodiesterase.

[Influence of soil moisture, nitrogen and phosphorus contents on Bauhinia faberi seedlings growth characteristics in arid valley of Minjiang River]. To study the influence of resources thresholds on plant growth is a major theme in restoration ecology. Based on the simulation of the natural thresholds of soil moisture, nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) under drought condition in the arid valley of Mingjiang River, a full factorial experiment was designed to study the dynamics of Bauhinia faberi seedlings survival rate, growth, biomass production, and resources use efficiency across one growth season. High soil moisture (40% field water capacity), high soil P (24 mg P x kg(-1)), and low N (100 mg N x kg(-1)) increased the seedlings survival rate, and promoted the seedlings growth, biomass production, and water use efficiency. There was a significant coupling effect between soil N and P, but the interactions between soil moisture and soil N and P were not obvious. High N (240 mg N x kg(-1)) restrained the seedlings growth markedly, while high P mitigated the negative effects of high N via increasing root area, root length, and root mass to promote the seedlings N and P uptake. The N and P use efficiency across one growth season kept steady, and had significant positive correlation with root/shoot mass ratio. The combination of high soil moisture, low N, and high P promoted the seedlings growth effectively, while that of low soil moisture, low P, and high N inhibited the seedlings growth markedly.

Norbin ablation results in defective adult hippocampal neurogenesis and depressive-like behavior in mice. Adult neurogenesis in the hippocampus subgranular zone is associated with the etiology and treatment efficiency of depression. Factors that affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been shown to contribute to the neuropathology of depression. Glutamate, the major excitatory neurotransmitter, plays a critical role in different aspects of neurogenesis. Of the eight metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), mGluR5 is the most highly expressed in neural stem cells. We previously identified Norbin as a positive regulator of mGluR5 and showed that its expression promotes neurite outgrowth. In this study, we investigated the role of Norbin in adult neurogenesis and depressive-like behaviors using Norbin-deficient mice. We found that Norbin deletion significantly reduced hippocampal neurogenesis; specifically, the loss of Norbin impaired the proliferation and maturation of newborn neurons without affecting cell-fate specification of neural stem cells/neural progenitor cells (NSCs/NPCs). Norbin is highly expressed in the granular neurons in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, but it is undetectable in NSCs/NPCs or immature neurons, suggesting that the effect of Norbin on neurogenesis is likely caused by a nonautonomous niche effect. In support of this hypothesis, we found that the expression of a cell-cell contact gene, Desmoplakin, is greatly reduced in Norbin-deletion mice. Moreover, Norbin-KO mice show an increased immobility in the forced-swim test and the tail-suspension test and reduced sucrose preference compared with wild-type controls. Taken together, these results show that Norbin is a regulator of adult hippocampal neurogenesis and that its deletion causes depressive-like behaviors. 

Suppression of Propionibacterium acnes Infection and the Associated Inflammatory Response by the Antimicrobial Peptide P5 in Mice. The cutaneous inflammation associated with acne vulgaris is caused by the anaerobic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes through activation of the innate immune system in the skin. Current standard treatments for acne have limitations that include adverse effects and poor efficacy in many patients, making development of a more effective therapy highly desirable. In the present study, we demonstrate the protective effects of a novel customized Î±-helical cationic peptide, P5, against P. acnes-induced inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. Application of P5 significantly reduced expression of two inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNF-Î± in P. acnes-treated primary human keratinocytes, where P5 appeared to act in part by binding to bacterial lipoteichoic acid, thereby suppressing TLR2-to-NF-ÎºB signaling. In addition, in a mouse model of acne vulgaris, P5 exerted both anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects against P. acnes, but exerted no cytotoxic effects against skin cells. These results demonstrate that P5, and perhaps other cationic antimicrobial peptides, offer the unique ability to reduce numbers P. acnes cells in the skin and to inhibit the inflammation they trigger. This suggests these peptides could potentially be used to effectively treat acne without adversely affecting the skin.

[Effect of ecdysterone on survival of random-pattern skin flap in rats]. To investigate the effects of ecdysterone on the survival of the dorsal random-pattern skin flap with large length-to-width ratio in rats and its possible mechanisms. Twenty-four healthy adult SD rats (male and/or female) weighing 200-250 g were randomly divided into the experimental group and the control group (n = 12 per group). A caudally based dorsal random pattern skin flap, measuring 8 cm x 2 cm, was symmetrically raised. Ecdysterone (5 mg/kg) and normal saline (5 mg/kg) were injected into the abdominal cavity of rats in the experimental group and the control group at 10 minutes before operation and from the first to the fifth day after operation, respectively. The general condition of the rats was observed after operation. At 7 days after operation, the survival rate of the flap was detected, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the malonyldialdehyde (MDA) level were tested, HE and immunohistochemistry staining observation of the flap were performed. VIII factor dried microvessels in the middle part of the flap (4 cm far away from pedicle) were counted. All the rats survived until the end of the experiment. At 7 days after operation, the survival rate of the flap was 62.323% +/- 7.046% in the experimental group and 47.753% +/- 2.952% in the control group (P < 0.001); SOD activity was (54.560 +/- 4.535) U/mgprot in the experimental group and (23.962 +/- 3.985) U/mgprot in the control group (P < 0.001); MDA level was (8.445 +/- 0.992) nmol/mgprot in the experimental group and (14.983 +/- 0.929) nmol/mgprot in the control group (P < 0.001). Histology observation: compared with the control group, the inflammatory cells infiltration was less and the hyperplasia of fibers was more obvious in the experimental group. The microvessel counting in the middle part of the flap was 17.817 +/- 2.420 in the experimental group and 8.967 +/- 2.000 in the control group (P < 0.001). Perioperative intraperitoneal injection of ecdysterone can promote the survival of the random-pattern skin flaps with large length-to-width ratio. Its mechanism may be related to its effects of improving SOD activity, decreasing lipid peroxidation, and promoting angiogenesis of skin flaps.

[Analyze of the accommodative response in myopia anisometropes]. This study is designed to analyze the accommodative hysteresis, accommodative responses between two eyes of anisometropes. The difference of the shape and slope of the accommodative response curves under closed-loop state is evaluated. A comparison study between emmetropes and anisometropes was assessed as well. It was a case-control study. Forty volunteers, (age from 20 to 31 years) participated in the research. 20 subjects had emmetropia (spherical equivalent +0.37D to -0.25D in both eyes), 20 subjects had anisometropia with spherical power difference ranging from 2.50D to 7.00D between their two eyes. Accommodation taken by objective methods: RE and accommodative response (AR) to 1.00D, 2.00D, 3.00D, 4.00D stimulus were measured objectively by WV-500 binocular infrared optometer (Grand Seiko Co. Japan). The slope of the AR/AS was calculated and compared between different groups. Under closed-loop state, the higher refractive error eye of anisometropia had most accommodation lag followed by lower eye and emmetropic eye. In stimulus of 3.00D and 4.00D, the differences between higher eye and emmetropic eye were significant (t = 2.055, 2.410; P < 0.05). The differences of the slopes between two eyes of ainisometropes under all conditions were without significant difference (P > 0.05). But the slopes of higher refractive error were lower than that of emmetropoes (t = 2.550, P < 0.05). The accommodative responses of two eyes of anisometropia are different, the higher eye of anisometropia shows higher accommodation lag. Every non accommodation balance phenomenon showed by anisometropia may be associated either with different accommodation controller gain, or with higher threshold of "ciliary-lens" system or both. It is needed further study to clarify.


Work-life conflict and associations with work- and nonwork-related factors and with physical and mental health outcomes: a nationally representative cross-sectional study in Switzerland.

CUSUM: a dynamic tool for monitoring competency in cataract surgery performance. To apply cumulative sum (CUSUM) in monitoring performance of surgeons in cataract surgery and to evaluate the response of performance to intervention. A CUSUM analysis was applied to 80 phacoemulsification performed by three ophthalmic trainees and one consultant, for the occurrence of posterior capsular rupture and postoperative refracted vision of worse than 6/12 among patients without pre-existing ocular comorbidity. The CUSUM score of each consecutive procedure performed by an individual surgeon was calculated and charted on CUSUM chart. When trainees' CUSUM charts showed an unacceptable level of performance, their supervisors would give feedback and impose closer monitoring of subsequent surgeries. CUSUM charts of the trainees demonstrated an initial upward followed by flattening trend. This reflects learning curves in their process of acquiring competency in phacoemulsification. In contrast, the consultant showed a flat curve indicating an ongoing maintenance of competence. The CUSUM analysis is able to monitor and promptly detect adverse events and trends of unacceptable outcomes in cataract surgery. This objective and dynamic monitoring makes CUSUM a useful audit tool for individual surgeons, but more so for busy consultants who need to supervise trainees.

Association of FcRn Heavy Chain Encoding Gene (FCGRT) Polymorphisms with IgG Content in Bovine Colostrum. In this study, we evaluated haplotypes of the bovine FCGRT (encoding the FcRn heavy chain) and their relationship to the IgG concentration in bovine colostrum. Four single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), classified into five haplotypes, were identified in a total of 49 Holstein-Frisians cows. Haplotype 5 was found to be significantly associated with a high IgG level ([OR] = 9.90, 95%CI = 1.11-88.34, p = 0.016) and haplotype 2 exhibited a similar trend ([OR] = 2.89, 95%CI = 1.17-7.11, p = 0.019).

Exposure of pregnant women to indoor air pollution: a study from nine low and middle income countries. We studied exposure to solid fuel and second-hand tobacco smoke among pregnant women in south Asia, Africa and Latin America. Prospective cross-sectional survey. Antenatal clinics in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, Uruguay, Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, India and Pakistan. A total of 7,961 pregnant women in ten sites in nine countries were interviewed between October 2004 and September 2005. A standardized questionnaire on exposure to indoor air pollution (IAP) and second-hand smoke was administered to pregnant women during antenatal care. Exposure to IAP and second-hand tobacco smoke. South Asian pregnant women commonly reported use of wood (49.1-89.7%), crop residue and animal dung as cooking and heating fuel. African pregnant women reported higher use of charcoal (85.4-93.5%). Latin American pregnant women had greater use of petroleum gas. Among south Asian women, solid fuel use and cooking on an open flame inside the home were common. There was a significant association between solid fuel use and allowing smoking within the home at the Asian sites and in Zambia (p < 0.05). Pregnant women from low/middle income countries were commonly exposed to IAP secondary to use of solid fuels. Among these populations, exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke was also common. This combination of exposures likely increases the risk of poor pregnancy outcomes among the most vulnerable women. Our study highlights the importance of further research on the combined impact of IAP and second-hand tobacco smoke exposures on adverse maternal and perinatal outcomes.

Experiences with and Outcomes of Two Interventions to Maximize Engagement of Chronically Ill Adolescents During Hospital Consultations: A Mixed Methods Study. Improving patient-provider communication during hospital consultations is advocated to enhance self-management planning and transition readiness of adolescents with chronic conditions. This longitudinal mixed methods study evaluates the implementation and the outcomes of independent split-visit consultations and individual transition plans by 22 hospital teams participating in the Dutch Action Program 'On Your Own Feet Ahead!'. The interventions raised awareness in adolescents and professionals, improved adolescents' display of independent behaviors and led to more discussions about non-medical issues. Successful implementation required a team-based approach and clear explanation to parents and adolescents. Pediatric nurses played a pivotal role in improving transitional care. 

Changing the paradigm in the treatment of platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer: from platinum doublets to nonplatinum doublets and adding antiangiogenesis compounds. The optimal treatment for women with recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer is evolving. The objective of this review is to outline the transition away from platinum doublets toward nonplatinum combinations and review emerging data on antiangiogenesis therapy in this setting. Recently published and presented data as well as ongoing clinical trials are discussed. Current clinical practice largely harmonizes with a paradigm that outlines a treatment algorithm for recurrent ovarian cancer based on the duration of platinum-free exposure. In this model, patients whose penultimate platinum compound exposure (platinum-free interval [PFI]) is longer than 6 months are generally offered a platinum agent or a platinum-containing doublet; those with a shorter interval are usually treated with a single nonplatinum agent. This is based on the simple contention that better clinical outcomes will be realized with platinum in those deemed platinum sensitive (PFI >6 months). However, it is becoming clear from various phase II and phase III clinical studies that the performance of many nonplatinum chemotherapeutic agents is also influenced by this parameter (PFI). Indeed, although definitive comparisons of nonplatinum drugs to novel cytotoxic agents are lacking, the clinical activity of these compounds might approach or exceed that of platinum agents. Although recognized by clinicians, the dichotomy that determines therapy based on PFI has not been formally accepted by the US Food and Drug Administration in all cases of drug labeling. For instance, whereas the combination of gemcitabine and carboplatin is now approved for patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, traditionally used platinum-resistant (PFI <6 months) agents such as topotecan and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin are also approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as single agents in platinum-sensitive patients. Furthermore, the nonplatinum doublet pegylated liposomal doxorubicin and trabectedin has recently documented comparable activity to platinum combinations among patients with a PFI of longer than 6 months. To that end, the most prolific developmental therapeutics arena in ovarian cancer is biologically targeted therapy, particularly angiogenesis inhibitors. Although it is unknown if the clinical activity from these new agents will respect the chemotherapy-sensitive dichotomy, it is clear that they have the potential to augment efficacy, possibly in both traditionally chemosensitive and chemoresistant phenotypes. The term platinum sensitive should probably be replaced by chemotherapy sensitive, particularly as new nonplatinum agents and combinations are identified as active in this setting. Nonplatinum doublets are effective in treating platinum-sensitive recurrent disease, and adding antiangiogenesis agents to these combinations is a research priority.

Sequential chemotherapy with carboplatin followed by weekly paclitaxel in advanced ovarian cancer: results of a multicenter phase II study of the northeastern German society of gynecological oncology. For the adjuvant setting of advanced ovarian cancer (AOC) after primary radical surgery the combination of paclitaxel and platinum in a 3-week schedule has emerged as the current standard. In preclinical studies additional anti-angiogenic effects of low dose paclitaxel infusion were demonstrated. A sequential schedule of carboplatin and paclitaxel has the potential to improve the therapeutic index. In this multicenter phase II trial four cycles of carboplatin at a dose of AUC 5 (d1/q21d) followed by 12 cycles of weekly paclitaxel at a dose of 80 mg/m(2) (d1/q7d) were applied after primary radical surgery. Eligible were all optimally or sub-optimally debulked patients with FIGO IA-IV ovarian cancer. All patients with hemoglobin levels <12 mg/dl received erythropoietin additionally. Between July 2003 and May 2005, 105 patients from 27 institutions were enrolled. The median age was 60 years (range: 23-80 years). A median number of 16 courses (range 1-16) were applied. The incidence of non-hematological toxicities was very low. Only 41% of patients experienced alopecia (grade 1-2). Neurotoxicity (grade 3-4) was not observed. Grade 3-4 hematological toxicity (43% of all patients) included thrombocytopenia (17%), anemia (3%), leucopenia (23%), and neutropenic fever (0%). Ninety-seven percent received erythropoietin. Thromboembolic events (4%) were not increased in patients who received erythropoietin. After a median time of 23 months (range: 1-42 months) 32 patients had died, and the median overall survival was not reached. The progression-free survival was 25.4 months (95% CI: 18.8-40+). These results suggest that this sequential regimen using weekly paclitaxel represents an efficacious and well-tolerated regimen. A randomized study comparing this new schedule with the conventional 3-week protocol is warranted.

[Autoimmune thyroiditis: diagnosis and treatment]. Autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) is an autoimmune disease with genetic background. Women are more likely to develop AIT. In adulthood, AIT is the most frequent cause for acquired hypothyroidism. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen (CTL-4) may play a role in the etiology of the disease. Diagnosis is made by determination of elevated antibodies against thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin, and a hypoechoic pattern in ultrasound. In case of hypothyroidism a substitutive therapy with levothyroxine is necessary. AIT may occur as postpartum thyroiditis or as a special entity as consequence of therapy with cytokines.

Current perspectives of the roles of the central norepinephrine system in anxiety and depression. Norepinephrine (NE) is a major monoamine neurotransmitter that has widespread effects across multiple brain areas to regulate arousal and stress responses. The underlying function of the NE cortical system is to balance vigilance/scanning behavior with focused attention on novel environmental stimuli and the state of arousal. The central NE system is involved intrinsically with the stress response system, and dysregulation within the NE system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety and depressive disorders. Central NE activity paradoxically has either anxiogenic or anxiolytic effects, depending on whether the time course of the stress is acute or chronic, whether the stress is predictable or unpredictable, and which underlying brain regions are affected. Under conditions of chronic stress, NE system activity dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system may turn a homeostatic stress response into a pathological stress response. Data suggest that the NE interplay with the serotonin system may exert neurobiological normalization of the pathophysiological state of anxious depression. Accordingly, pharmacological interventions targeting the NE system can result in anxiolytic, rather than anxiogenic, outcomes when used to treat patients with anxiety and depression.

[Photosynthetic characters of Quercus acutissima from different provenances under effects of salt stress]. The photosynthetic characteristics of Quercus acutissima from Feixian, Chuzhou and Wanyuan provenances were investigated under NaCl stress at 5 concentrations. For the three provenances, their leaf chlorophyll a (Chl a) and chlorophyll b (Chl b) contents and net photosynthetic rate (Pn) decreased with increasing salt stress, among which, the maximal decrement of Chl a content was 21.5%-36.1% for Feixian provenance, and 3.5%-19.8% for Wanyuan provenance. The diurnal variation of Pn, in control groups had a single peak, and no midday photosynthetic depression was observed. Under high salt stress, all the provenances presented midday photosynthetic depression. Path analysis indicated that the major factors affecting Pn were vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and leaf temperature (Tl) , while the minor factors were stomatal conductance (Gs) , intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci), and photosynthetically active radiation (PARi). In the control groups, the photosynthetic characteristics mainly depended on the climate factors of provenance location. Based on the variations of leaf chlorophyll contents and Pn among the provenances under different salt stress, Wanyuan provenance had the highest salt tolerance, followed by Chuzhou provenance, and Feixian provenance.

Autism susceptibility candidate 2 (Auts2) encodes a nuclear protein expressed in developing brain regions implicated in autism neuropathology. Autism susceptibility candidate 2 (Auts2) is a gene associated with autism and mental retardation, whose function is unknown. Expression of Auts2 mRNA and protein were studied in the developing mouse brain by in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and western blotting. Auts2 mRNA was highly expressed in the developing cerebral cortex and cerebellum, regions often affected by neuropathological changes in autism, and a few other brain regions. On embryonic day (E) 12, Auts2 mRNA was expressed in the cortical preplate, where it colocalized with Tbr1, a transcription factor specific for postmitotic projection neurons. From E16 to postnatal day 21, Auts2 was expressed most abundantly in frontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum, including Purkinje cells and deep nuclei. High levels of Auts2 were also detected in developing dorsal thalamus, olfactory bulb, inferior colliculus and substantia nigra. Auts2 protein showed similar regional expression patterns as the mRNA. At the cellular level, Auts2 protein was localized in the nuclei of neurons and some neuronal progenitors.

Automated radiolabelling of monoclonal antibodies with the Modular Lab system. Automation of radiopharmaceutical preparation represents a way of reducing radiation doses to operators and providing good manufacturing practice-compliant manufacture of radiopharmaceuticals. Although widely adopted for PET radiochemical synthesis, such methods have not widely been used for the preparation of therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. Here we describe an evaluation of an automated system for the preparation of radiolabelled antibodies. A labelling method based on the Modular Lab system was developed and applied to the radiolabelling of the monoclonal antibody conjugate, YAML568-CHX'A-DTPA, with indium-111. Antibodies were labelled using both manual and automated means and analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography and thin-layer chromatography methods. Radiochemical purities achieved using automation (mean 98%) were slightly lower than those achieved manually (mean 99%); however, the radiochemical purity obtained was reproducible and well within the set specification of greater than 95%. The Modular Lab system can be used to automate the radiolabelling of monoclonal antibody-chelate conjugates with metallic isotopes such as indium for the potential application for therapeutic radionuclide therapy.


Mannequin or standardized patient: participants' assessment of two training modalities in trauma team simulation.

Rearrangements of the actin cytoskeleton and E-cadherin-based adherens junctions caused by neoplasic transformation change cell-cell interactions. E-cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, which is essential for the maintenance of the architecture and integrity of epithelial tissues, is often lost during carcinoma progression. To better understand the nature of alterations of cell-cell interactions at the early stages of neoplastic evolution of epithelial cells, we examined the line of nontransformed IAR-2 epithelial cells and their descendants, lines of IAR-6-1 epithelial cells transformed with dimethylnitrosamine and IAR1170 cells transformed with N-RasG12D. IAR-6-1 and IAR1170 cells retained E-cadherin, displayed discoid or polygonal morphology, and formed monolayers similar to IAR-2 monolayer. Fluorescence staining, however, showed that in IAR1170 and IAR-6-1 cells the marginal actin bundle, which is typical of nontransformed IAR-2 cells, disappeared, and the continuous adhesion belt (tangential adherens junctions (AJs)) was replaced by radially oriented E-cadherin-based AJs. Time-lapse imaging of IAR-6-1 cells stably transfected with GFP-E-cadherin revealed that AJs in transformed cells are very dynamic and unstable. The regulation of AJ assembly by Rho family small GTPases was different in nontransformed and in transformed IAR epithelial cells. As our experiments with the ROCK inhibitor Y-27632 and the myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin have shown, the formation and maintenance of radial AJs critically depend on myosin II-mediated contractility. Using the RNAi technique for the depletion of mDia1 and loading cells with N17Rac, we established that mDia1 and Rac are involved in the assembly of tangential AJs in nontransformed epithelial cells but not in radial AJs in transformed cells. Neoplastic transformation changed cell-cell interactions, preventing contact paralysis after the establishment of cell-cell contact and promoting dynamic cell-cell adhesion and motile behavior of cells. It is suggested that the disappearance of the marginal actin bundle and rearrangements of AJs may change the adhesive function of E-cadherin and play an active role in migratory activity of carcinoma cells.

A micropower support vector machine based seizure detection architecture for embedded medical devices. Implantable neurostimulators for the treatment of epilepsy that are capable of sensing seizures can enable novel therapeutic applications. However, detecting seizures is challenging due to significant intracranial EEG signal variability across patients. In this paper, we illustrate how a machine-learning based, patient-specific seizure detector provides better performance and lower power consumption than a patient non-specific detector using the same seizure library. The machine-learning based architecture was fully implemented in the micropower domain, demonstrating feasibility for an embedded detector in implantable systems.

Care-seeking in the development of severe community acquired pneumonia in Ugandan children. Improved case management of paediatric pneumonia is recognised as a key strategy for pneumonia control. Since symptoms of pneumonia and malaria often overlap, there are concerns that children with pneumonia are treated with antimalarial drugs. There is a need to describe how children with severe pneumonia have been managed prior to their arrival at hospital, including possible risks of developing more severe disease. A case-series study of 140 children, aged 2-59 months, with severe radiologically verified pneumonia at Mulago Hospital, Kampala was undertaken. Caretakers were interviewed about initial symptoms, treatment given and care sought. Using WHO definitions, children were clinically classified as having severe or very severe pneumonia. The children had been ill for a median of 7 days before arrival at hospital, 90/140 (64%) had received treatment at home, and 72/140 (51%) had seen another health-care provider prior to presentation at hospital. Altogether, 32/140 (23%) children had reportedly received antibiotics only prior to admission, 18/140 (13%) had received anti-malarials only and 35/140 (25%) had received both. Being classified as very severe pneumonia was more common among children who had received anti-malarials only (OR 5.5, 1.8-16.4). Although the majority of caretakers were able to recognise the key symptoms of pneumonia, they did not respond with any immediate care-giving action. Since progression from first recognition of pneumonia symptoms to severe disease is rapid, management guidelines regarding timing of care-seeking need to be clearly defined. The reason why children who sought health facility care failed to improve should be investigated. Meanwhile, there is a need to increase caretakers' and health workers' awareness of the urgency to act promptly when key pneumonia symptoms are observed.

[Advance in the anti-tumor mechanism of triptolide]. Triptolide, an epoxidated diterpene lactone compound separated from a traditional Chinese medicine, Tripterygium wilfordiiHook. f (TWHF), is responsible for the anti-tumor activity of TWHF with broad spectrum and high performance. The antitumor mechanism of triptolide locates in many fields, such as inducing apoptosis of tumor cell, interfering in the cell cycle, and suppressing angiogeneis. The advance in the anti-tumor mechanism of triptolide is described in the following review.

Targeted imaging modality selection for bacterial biofilms in chronic rhinosinusitis. Biofilms are increasingly recognized as having an etiological role in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS). Research into biofilms in CRS currently relies on microscopic imaging techniques, none of which are universally accepted. This study compares LIVE/DEAD BacLight (Invitrogen Corp., Carlsbad, CA) staining and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), both utilizing the confocal scanning laser microscope (CSLM) for biofilm determination and characterization in CRS patients. Prospective study. Twenty CRS patients undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery were recruited for the study. Sinus mucosal tissue harvested at the time of surgery underwent both the BacLight/CSLM and FISH/CSLM protocols for biofilm determination and characterization. Combining the results of both protocols, 18/20 (90%) patients had bacterial biofilms demonstrable on at least one modality. The high biofilm detection rate combining the two techniques suggests the prevalence of biofilms in CRS may be greater than previously reported. The protocols had equivalent results in 15/20 patients. Using the differences observed in the remaining five patients, we can highlight the most appropriate use for each technique. BacLight/CSLM and FISH/CSLM are complementary techniques for biofilm determination and characterization. Both protocols are suited to different research areas and the selection of technique used should be based on the specific objectives of the research protocol. In this way we can utilize the advantages of each technique to facilitate effective research.

Erythrocyte Osmotic Fragility and Excitability Score in Rabbit fed Hibiscus Sabdariffa in Graded Level. This study was conducted for 10 weeks with the aim of investigating the erythrocyte membrane integrity as measured by erythrocyte osmotic fragility and excitability scores of rabbits fed graded level of Hibiscus sabdariffa calyx (HSC). Twenty weaners' rabbit of both sexes were used for the study and were placed on four experimental diets which contain the following percentages of HSC 0 %, 25 %, 50 %, 75 %, as feed additive and were added at 0 g, 62.5 g, 125 g, 187.5 g designated as T1, T2, T3 and T4 experimental diets. Excitability scores were measured weekly as described by Voisnet et al. (1997). At the end of the experiment, the rabbits were slaughtered by severing the jugular vein. A Blood sample (2 ml) was collected from each rabbit into sampled bottles, containing the Na EDTA as anticoagulant for hematological analysis. Packed cell volume (PCV) Haemoglobin concentration (Hb), Total red blood cell (RBC) count, Total leukocyte count as well as differential leukocyte was determined using standard method. The percentage haemolysis recorded at 0.3 % to 0.8 % was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in rabbits in T1 compared to the remaining 3 diets. The result of excitability score shows that rabbit on diet 1 and 2 had a lower value which was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than rabbits on diets 3 and 4 with a value of 65.5 Â± 5.0 and 70.00 Â± 5.50 % respectively. In conclusion this study demonstrated for the first time that chronic administration of HSC improves haematological parameters, brain mood and function as well as maintaining erythrocyte membrane integrity.

Quantitative investigation of bone microvascularization from 3D synchrotron micro-computed tomography in a rat model. A new method for simultaneous 3D imaging and analysis of microvascularization and bone microstructure in rat bone is developed. The method is based on the use of quantitative synchrotron micro-computed tomography (SR-microCT) coupled to an automatic image analysis procedure. Analysis of bone microvascularization is generally performed from 2D histology. The proposed method enables for the first time the simultaneous 3D analysis of microvascularization and bone microstructure in a rat model. It was applied to investigate the effect of intermittent parathyroid hormone (PTH) administration on angiogenesis and osteogenesis in rats. Rats were posthumously injected with a contrast agent and subsequently imaged. The algorithm allowed the reconstruction and the extraction of 3D quantitative parameters both on bone microstructure and microvascularization. Due to the short acquisition times of SR-microCT and the efficiency of the image analysis algorithm, a large data set was analyzed, which permitted statistical analysis of the measured parameters. Statistical analysis confirmed that treatment with PTH significantly increased bone volume and thickness, but decreased bone mineralization. It was further revealed that treatment with PTH significantly increased average vessel thickness.

Calvarial reshaping using bifocal bidirectional transport distraction osteogenesis. The aim of this study is to assess 3-dimensional reconstruction of cranial defects by use of bifocal bidirectional transport distraction osteogenesis (BBTDO). This study was performed on 8 sheep, divided into a control group (n = 3) and treatment group (n = 5). Full-thickness cranial defects (50 x 40 mm) were created on calvaria. In the control group only the skin was closed. In the treatment group BBTDO was performed. Distraction was performed with a custom-made distraction device with a transport segment of 40 x 20 mm. After a 5-day period of latency, distraction was applied to the transport segment. During the first 20 days of distraction, the transport segment was distracted 1 mm in the forward direction and 0.5 mm in the upward direction. After the next 20 days of distraction, the transport segment was distracted 1 mm forward and 0.5 downward. After a total of 40 days' distraction, a 30-day consolidation period was applied. Macroscopic, radiologic (computed tomography with volume measurements), and histologic evaluations were done. No major complications were seen during the whole study period. In the control group the bone defects remained unhealed at the end of the study period. The same-sized defects in the treatment group healed with a convexity like the calvaria. Preoperative and postoperative cranial volume measurements of the treatment group animals showed an increase in cranial volume (P < .05). Histologic evaluation showed inductive bone regeneration and mature bone structure development within the distraction zone. The BBTDO is an effective and safe technique for 3-dimensional closure of cranial defects.

Progressive changes in synaptic inputs to motoneurons in adult sacral spinal cord of a mouse model of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by progressive degeneration of motoneurons. One potential mechanism is excitotoxicity. We studied the behaviors of spinal neurons using an in vitro preparation of the sacral cord from the G93A SOD1 mouse model of ALS. Measurements were conducted at presymptomatic [approximately postnatal day 50 (approximately P50)], early (approximately P90), and late (>P120) stages of the disease. Short-latency reflexes (SRs) in ventral roots, presumably monosynaptic, were evoked by electrical stimulation of a dorsal root. The fraction of motoneurons capable of responding to this activation was evaluated by measuring the compound action potential [total motor activity (TMA)] evoked by antidromic stimulation of the distal ventral root. In mutant SOD1 (mSOD1) mice, both the SR and the TMA decreased with age compared with nontransgenic littermates, ruling out the SR as a source of increasing excitotoxicity. Spinal interneuron activity was assessed using the synchronized ventral root bursts generated by both bath application of blockers of inhibitory neurotransmitters (glycine, GABA(A)) and agonists of glutamate receptors (especially NMDA receptors). After symptom onset, a higher percentage of preparations from mSOD1 mice exhibited bursting, and these bursts exhibited more sub-bursts and a more disorganized pattern. In mSOD1 mice with clear muscle tremor, the ventral roots exhibited spontaneous synchronized bursts, which were highly sensitive to the blockade of NMDA receptors. These data suggest that although short-latency sensory input does not increase as symptoms develop, interneuron activity does increase and may contribute to excitotoxicity.


Relationship between pseudoexfoliation syndrome and erectile dysfunction: a possible cause of endothelial dysfunction for development of erectile dysfunction.

Fast and automatic LV mass calculation from echocardiographic images via B-spline snake model and Markov random fields. Left ventricular (LV) mass has several important diagnostic and indicative implications. In this paper, a fast and accurate technique for detection of inner and outer boundaries of LV and, consequently, calculation of LV mass from apical 4-chamber echocardiographic images is presented. For detection of the inner boundary, a modified B-spline snake is proposed, which relies merely on image intensity and obviates the need for computationally-demanding image forces. The outer boundary is then obtained using a Markov random fields model in the neighborhood of the estimated inner border. Experimental validation of the proposed technique demonstrates remarkable improvement over conventional algorithms.

Telangiectases in scleroderma: a potential clinical marker of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Clinical markers are needed to identify scleroderma patients at risk for pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) since early therapy may improve survival. We investigated whether increased numbers of telangiectases in scleroderma associate with measures of pulmonary vascular disease. One hundred forty-seven consecutive adult patients with scleroderma were enrolled in this cross-sectional study and scored for the presence of matted telangiectases on 11 body areas. Per body area, telangiectases were scored as 0 if none were present, 1 if there were fewer than 10 telangiectases, and 2 if 10 or more telangiectases were counted. Linear regression analysis was performed to assess the association between right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) and telangiectasia score, adjusted for age, race, smoking status, scleroderma subtype, disease duration, and autoantibody status. Logistic regression analysis was performed with PAH by right-heart catheterization (RHC) as the dependent variable. The mean telangiectasia score was 6.0 (SD 4.5, range 0-20). RVSP and telangiectasia score were positively correlated (r = 0.271, p = 0.001). The mean RVSP increased by 10.9 mm Hg for every 10-point increase in telangiectasia score (95% CI 3.6-18.3 mm Hg, p = 0.004), adjusted for potential confounders. The adjusted relative odds of PAH by RHC were 12.4 for patients with a 10-point increase in telangiectasia score (95% CI 1.78-85.9, p = 0.01). Increased numbers of telangiectases strongly associate with the presence of pulmonary vascular disease. Telangiectases may be a clinical marker of more widespread aberrant microvascular disease in scleroderma.

Anticancer bioactive peptide suppresses human gastric cancer growth through modulation of apoptosis and the cell cycle. Anticancer bioactive peptide (ACBP) was extracted from goat spleens with immunization by human gastric cancer extracts. ACBP was biochemically purified and identified as approximately 8,000 Da peptide. Here we report that ACBP significantly inhibited the growth of human gastric cancer line BGC-823 in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. ACBP induced BGC-823 cell apoptosis was observed morphologically both by light microscopy and electronic microscopy; and ACBP-induced apoptosis and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest were quantified by Annexin V-FITC/PI staining and flow cytometry. At the molecular level, ACBP induced p16Ink4, p21Waf1, p27Kip1, and bax tumor suppressor and apoptotic gene expression, as well as inhibited cyclin D1, c-myc, and bcl-2 gene expression that promote tumorigenesis. In vivo, ACBP dramatically inhibited human gastric tumor growth in a xenograft model with no apparent cytotoxicity to host. Our study suggests that ACBP could be a powerful anticancer biological product through induction of cell apoptosis and cell cycle arrest.

Nested PCR Biases in Interpreting Microbial Community Structure in 16S rRNA Gene Sequence Datasets. Sequencing of the PCR-amplified 16S rRNA gene has become a common approach to microbial community investigations in the fields of human health and environmental sciences. This approach, however, is difficult when the amount of DNA is too low to be amplified by standard PCR. Nested PCR can be employed as it can amplify samples with DNA concentration several-fold lower than standard PCR. However, potential biases with nested PCRs that could affect measurement of community structure have received little attention. In this study, we used 17 DNAs extracted from vaginal swabs and 12 DNAs extracted from stool samples to study the influence of nested PCR amplification of the 16S rRNA gene on the estimation of microbial community structure using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Nested and standard PCR methods were compared on alpha- and beta-diversity metrics and relative abundances of bacterial genera. The effects of number of cycles in the first round of PCR (10 vs. 20) and microbial diversity (relatively low in vagina vs. high in stool) were also investigated. Vaginal swab samples showed no significant difference in alpha diversity or community structure between nested PCR and standard PCR (one round of 40 cycles). Stool samples showed significant differences in alpha diversity (except Shannon's index) and relative abundance of 13 genera between nested PCR with 20 cycles in the first round and standard PCR (P<0.01), but not between nested PCR with 10 cycles in the first round and standard PCR. Operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that had low relative abundance (sum of relative abundance <0.167) accounted for most of the distortion (>27% of total OTUs in stool). Nested PCR introduced bias in estimated diversity and community structure. The bias was more significant for communities with relatively higher diversity and when more cycles were applied in the first round of PCR. We conclude that nested PCR could be used when standard PCR does not work. However, rare taxa detected by nested PCR should be validated by other technologies.

Efficient, regioselective access to bicyclic imidazo[1,2-x]- heterocycles via gold- and base-promoted cyclization of 1-alkynylimidazoles. Reactions of 1-alkynylimidazoles involving the formation of their 2-lithio derivatives followed by addition of aldehydes or ketones are presented. The method gives access to 1-alkynyl-2-(hydroxymethyl)imidazoles which undergo 6-endo-dig or 5-exo-dig cyclization under AuCl(3)- or base-catalyzed conditions to yield imidazo[1,2-c]oxazoles and imidazo[2,1-c][1,4]oxazine heterocycles. Under transition metal catalysis, the reaction occurs in a regiospecific manner, leading exclusively to the product of 6-endo-dig attack, whereas under basic conditions, the reaction takes place in a regioselective manner giving preferentially the product from 5-exo-dig attack.

Evaluation of the OECD 314B activated sludge die-away test for assessing the biodegradation of pharmaceuticals. The European Medicines Agency guideline for the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products provides a step-by-step phased approach to evaluate the potential risks of new medicines to the environment. Phase I ("prescreen") estimates the initial exposure of the new medicine in the environment. Phase II A ("screen") estimates the fate and effects in the environment. The fate screen determines the inherent properties of the new medicinal active ingredient to sorb to sludge, soil, and sediment matrices and its potential to degrade in a sewage treatment plant and in the subsequent water-sediment compartment. Current ERA Guidance (2006) recommends the OECD 301B Ready Biodegradation Test for Phase II Tier A testing without a clear recommendation for Phase II Tier B testing when further refinement may be needed. With the recent approval of the OECD 314B method for activated sludge, there is now an alternative test method that may be better suited for Phase II Tier A testing and to the data needs of the ERA. As a batch test, it fits the needs of a Tier A screen. It is not designed to simulate the operational steps of a sewage treatment plant, such as the OECD 303 tests, and yet provides the following without considerable costs or resources of OECD 303: (1) useful kinetic information in a test that reflects the conditions of the sewage-treatment environment, i.e., realistic biomass solids concentrations and low level test material concentrations to simulate first-order (nongrowth) kinetics, (2) mass balance analysis for CO(2) evolution and for residues found in mixed liquor, (3) use of an abiotic control to assess losses other than those attributed to biotic biodegradation, and (4) biotransformation profile of degradants. This paper presents the results of OECD 301B with that of OECD 314B for activated sludge biodegradation for five Pfizer drug substances. The use of this new method as an alternative to OECD 301B would strengthen the fate testing screen in Phase II Tier A of the EMEA ERA. It would provide a characterization of a substance's potential for biotransformation and mineralization during sewage treatment and provide a means for revising predicted environmental concentration of surface water for amount removed during sewage treatment.

Endoscopic transnasal resection of ectopic esthesioneuroblastoma in the pterygopalatine fossa: technical case report. Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare, malignant neoplasm arising from the olfactory neuroepithelium in the upper nasal cavity. Even more rare is ectopic esthesioneuroblastoma developing from the region outside the olfactory epithelium. In addition, tumors occurring in the pterygopalatine fossa (PPF) are uncommon, and the endoscopic transnasal approach for the resection of malignant tumors in this region is also uncommon. We describe an esthesioneuroblastoma arising from the left maxillary sinus and PPF. The tumor was resected using the endoscopic transnasal approach, followed by treatment with radiotherapy. The patient showed no evidence of recurrence 12 months postoperatively. The endoscopic transnasal approach could be successfully used for the complete removal of malignant tumors in the PPF. The PPF is an anatomic area that is difficult to access. The endoscopic transnasal approach improves access and visualization; it also has the potential to reduce complications compared with the open approach. The endoscopic transnasal approach might become the treatment of choice for malignant tumors in the PPF.

Suicidal thoughts and depressive feelings amongst Estonian schoolchildren: effect of family relationship and family structure. Depressive feelings and suicidal ideation in a non-clinical sample of adolescents in Estonia were analysed in the context of family structure, mutual relationships amongst family members and schoolchildren's preferences regarding intimate personal contacts with particular family members. Data from the WHO collaborative study 'Health Behaviour in School-aged Children 2005/2006' (HBSC) were used. A representative sample of schoolchildren aged 11, 13 and 15 years completed the semi-structured questionnaire. The analyses included only adolescents living in households with at least one birth parent. The subjects were 4,389 schoolchildren (2,178 boys and 2,211 girls), who were divided into three groups based on: (1) suicidal thoughts, with or without depressive feelings; (2) depressive feelings; and (3) neither suicidal thoughts nor depressive feelings. Multinomial logistic regression was used. The proportion of depressive feelings increased with age for both boys and girls. Girls expressed depressive feelings more frequently than boys from ages 13 and 15 years, and suicidal thoughts from age 15 years. Self-reported satisfaction with relationships in the family reduced the likelihood of depressive feelings and suicidal thoughts. Good communication with the parents reduced the likelihood of suicidal thoughts in all age groups. Adolescents who were satisfied with their family relationships suffered less frequently from depressive feelings and suicidal thoughts. The best environment for an adolescent was a family with both birth parents. Of the adolescents in 'non-intact' families, those with a step-parent in the family showed suicidal thoughts more frequently than those in single-parent families. Associations between family-related variables and suicidal thoughts were significant even after adjusting for family economic deprivation score.


Road safety in the political agenda: the impact on road traffic injuries.

Reporter cell lines for skin sensitization testing. Skin sensitization has been described as an adverse outcome pathway (AOP), comprising a number of molecular events leading to the final adverse effect. In a new paradigm of toxicology, attempts are made to collect information using single mechanistic tests addressing different targets along such an AOP and to then integrate this information to arrive at a final toxicological prediction. This proposal is strongly influenced by the availability of methods for high-throughput screening of cellular events. Reporter cell lines are a particularly useful tool in such screening paradigms, as they can deliver highly reproducible and easily measureable results, and they can be designed to quantify induction or suppression at the transcription level of very specific molecular targets within cells. The first cell-based assay for skin sensitization, which has recently received ECVAM and OECD endorsement, is the reporter cell assay KeratinoSensâ¢, reflecting activation of the Nrf2 pathway, and other assays measuring the Nrf2 pathway are under development or validation. An alternative approach (THP-G8) was recently developed based on activation of the Interleukin-8 gene. Here, we review these assays, their role in the AOP, their mechanistic interrelationships, their use for hazard and risk assessment, and their application in integrated testing strategies. At the same time, this study reviews (1) other cellular markers for sensitizers, and the potential to develop new reporter gene assays providing additional, non-redundant information, and (2) it presents approaches and new experimental data on attempts to further improve the predictivity of the existing assay.

A Genetic Basis for Motivated Exercise. Prior research has demonstrated a genetic basis for motivated exercise, with evidence of a role for nescient helix-loop-helix-2 (NHLH2/Nhlh2). Nhlh2 transcriptionally regulates the monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) gene. This article examines the evidence for the hypothesis that polymorphisms in NHLH2 or MAO-A contribute to differences in the human motivation for exercise and physical activity. The genetic pathways that link exercise and motivation are discussed.

Remapping in the ipsilesional motor cortex after VR-based training: a pilot fMRI study. In a single case longitudinal study, a 70 year old female subject who has had a subcortical stroke 8 years prior, was tested three times in fMRI using an interactive MRI-compatible VR environment. The subject performed sequential finger movements with her right (unaffected) hand. Her hand motion (recorded with the data glove) animated either the ipsilateral (corresponding) or contralateral (mirrored) virtual hand model. In a visual feedback control condition, the virtual hand models were replaced with ellipsoids. In between the second and third session, the patient participated in an intensive, two-week long VR-based training of her affected upper extremity. When comparing activation in the mirrored versus the non-mirrored virtual visual feedback condition, no significant activation was noted in motor or premotor areas in the baseline 1 or baseline 2 sessions. However, increased activation in the ipsilesional motor cortex occurred as a result of training, despite the absence of active involvement of the ipsilesional motor cortex in this condition. The left motor cortex was also recruited in this condition (though weaker) despite the subtracted out ellipsoid condition (in which subjects also moved their hand). Thus, the contralateral (mirrored) visual feedback may have had a facilitory effect bilaterally. These findings might have some important implications for the development of novel therapies in the acute phase, when paresis and the potential for neural remapping are greatest.

A randomized trial of external beam radiotherapy versus cryoablation in patients with localized prostate cancer. Localized prostate cancer can be treated several different ways, but head-to-head comparisons of treatments are infrequent. The authors of this report conducted a randomized, unblinded, noninferiority trial to compare cryoablation with external beam radiotherapy in these patients. From December 1997 through February 2003, 244 men with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer were assigned randomly to receive either cryoablation or radiotherapy (122 men in each arm). All received neoadjuvant antiandrogen therapy. The primary endpoint was disease progression at 36 months based on a trifecta definition: 1) radiologic evidence of metastatic disease, or 2) initiation of further antineoplastic therapy, or 3) biochemical failure. Two definitions of biochemical failure were used: 1) 2 consecutive rises in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) with a final value >1.0 ng/mL, and 2) a rise above PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL. Secondary endpoints included overall survival, disease-specific survival, and prostate biopsy at 36 months. The median follow-up was 100 months. Disease progression at 36 months was observed in 23.9% (PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL, 17.1%) of men in the cryoablation arm and in 23.7% (PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL, 13.2%) of men in the radiotherapy arm. No difference in overall or disease-specific survival were observed. At 36 months, more patients in the radiotherapy arm had a cancer-positive biopsy (28.9%) compared with patients in the cryoablation arm (7.7%). The observed difference in disease progression at 36 months was small, 0.2%; however, because of the wide confidence interval, from -10.8% to 11.2%, it was not possible to rule out inferiority (defined a priori as a 10% difference). With longer term follow-up, the trend favors cryoablation. Significantly fewer positive biopsies were documented after cryoablation than after radiotherapy.

Increment of subcutaneous adipose tissue is associated with decrease of elastic fibres in the dermal layer. Obesity is a significant risk factor for various skin disorders, including pressure ulcer and delayed wound healing. We previously showed that increment of subcutaneous adipose tissue contributes to poor skin condition by decreasing dermal elasticity. Here, we examined the mechanism involved. Histologic observation of abdominal skin from middle-aged females with a wide range of body mass index (BMI), an indicator of subcutaneous fat mass, showed that dermal elastic fibre abundance was significantly decreased with increment of BMI. Concomitantly, adipocytes were significantly enlarged. Adipocyte enlargement was significantly negatively correlated with dermal elastic fibre abundance. We hypothesized that enlarged adipocytes negatively influence dermal elastic fibres, so we investigated elastic fibre-degrading factors in in vitro-cultured enlarged adipocytes. MMP9 gene expression and secretion were significantly increased; further, these changes were blocked by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor. Nuclear translocation (activation) of AP-1, a downstream ERK signalling molecule, was also observed in enlarged adipocytes. MMP9 abundance was significantly increased in skin of subjects with high BMI and enlarged adipocytes. These results suggest that increment of subcutaneous adipose tissue leads to adipocyte enlargement together with increased degradation of dermal elastic fibres, mediated at least in part by an ERK signalling-mediated increase of MMP9 in enlarged adipocytes.

Temporal and regional variations in the use of preoperative radiation therapy for rectal cancer. Preoperative (preop) chemoradiation therapy improves local control and reduces toxicity for stage II/III rectal cancer better than postoperative (postop) chemoradiation therapy. We examined the temporal and regional variations in the use of preop radiotherapy (RT) across the United States. Patients with stage II/III rectal cancer diagnosed between 1998 and 2005 who had a primary site resection were identified from the SEER database. The rate of preop RT use over time was plotted. Regression models were used to analyze regional variations. From 1998 to 2005, an increase of 1.7 in the ratio of preop RT/postoperative RT was noted, whereas the ratio of RT/no RT increased only by 0.7. The ratio of preop RT/postop RT increased from 0.5 to 1 in 5 years (1998-2003) but from 1 to 1.5 in 2 years (2003-2005). Multivariate regression analysis showed: patients with stage II disease were more likely than those with stage III disease, younger patients were more likely than older patients, and males were more likely than females to receive preop RT. Whites were more likely to receive preop RT than nonwhites for stage III disease only. Patients treated in the San Francisco region, Hawaii, New Mexico, Seattle, and Los Angeles were more likely to receive preop RT than were patients in the Connecticut, Detroit, Iowa, Utah, Atlanta, and San Jose/Monterey regions. The increasing use of preop RT varies across US regions and patient subgroups. Further studies should evaluate potentially modifiable factors contributing to these variations.

Cavo-atrial thrombectomy combined with left hemi-hepatectomy for vascular invasion from hepatocellular carcinoma on diseased liver under hypothermic cardio-circulatory arrest. Vascular invasion of supra-hepatic veins (SHV) is a major complication of primary liver tumours. The tumorous thrombus, when extended to the vena cava and right atrium, may produce occlusion of the tricuspid valve or pulmonary embolism with sudden cardiac death. The presence of macroscopic vascular infiltration represents an advanced stage of the tumour contraindicating liver transplantation, thus liver resection with thrombectomy is the only therapeutic option in this setting despite the concerns of postoperative liver failure and the dismal results at distance. A 45-year-old male with chronic active hepatitis/cirrhosis was referred to our department for a tumour in the left hemi-liver with infiltration of the left-middle hepatic veins and a tumour thrombus extension to the right atrium. We reported a successful cavo-atrial thrombectomy, along with left hemi-hepatectomy, under hypothermic cardio-circulatory arrest (HCA). To our knowledge, this technique has been used only once for primary liver cancer on chronic liver disease, this being the second case reported in literature. We conclude that this technique should be considered for atrial thrombi removal in patients affected by liver tumours in the presence of a healthy liver or of a well compensated liver cirrhosis in order to prolong the patient's life span.

"Never in All My Years... ": Nurses' Education About LGBT Health. In spite of recent calls for patient-centered care and greater attention to the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) patients, nurses still lack basic education about LGBT patient care and, as a result, may have negative attitudes, endorse stereotypes, and/or feel uncomfortable providing care. This study reports on education/training of practicing nurses and explores some of the reasons for nurses reporting feelings of discomfort with LGBT patient care. Transcripts from structured interviews with 268 nurses in the San Francisco Bay Area revealed that 80% had no education or training on LGBT issues. Although most said they were comfortable with LGBT patient care, some of their comments indicated that they might not be providing culturally sensitive care. Implications for nursing education and for policies and procedures of health care institutions are addressed. 

Relationship of circulating endothelial progenitor cells to the recurrence of atrial fibrillation after successful conversion and maintenance of sinus rhythm. To determine whether the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) predicts arrhythmia recurrence after direct current cardioversion (DCCV). The numbers of circulating CD34+/KDR+ EPCs were determined with flow cytometry in 51 consecutive patients with persistent AF [the mean age: 67 +/- 1.3 years, male (65%)] prior to DCCV and were compared with that of age- and sex-matched controls, and cohorts of patients with coronary artery disease and ischaemic stroke. The AF recurrence rate at 1 year was also determined. The EPCs in patients with persistent AF, patients with coronary artery disease, and patients with ischaemic stroke were significantly lower than that of the age- and sex-matched controls (P < 0.01). One year after successful DCCV, patients with high EPC count (50th to 100th percentile) had a higher recurrence rate of AF when compared with those with low EPC count (less than 50th percentile) (73 vs. 40%, P = 0.02). Cox regression analysis revealed the high EPC count was the only independent predictors for the AF recurrence (HR: 2.29, P = 0.047). The number of EPCs is reduced in patients with persistent AF and predicts the recurrence of AF after successful DCCV.

Proteins in ecotoxicology - how, why and why not? The growing interest in the application of proteomic technologies to solve toxicology issues and its relevance in ecotoxicology research has resulted in the emergence of "ecotoxicoproteomics". There is a general consensus that ecotoxicoproteomics is a powerful tool to spot early molecular events involved in toxicant responses, which are responsible for the adverse effects observed at higher levels of biological organization, thus contributing to elucidate the mode of action of stressors and to identify specific biomarkers. Ultimately, early-warning indicators can then be developed and deployed in "in situ" bioassays and in environmental risk assessment. The number of field experiments or laboratory trials using ecologically relevant test-species and involving proteomics has been, until recently, insufficient to allow a critical analysis of the real benefits of the application of this approach to ecotoxicology. This article intends to present an overview on the applications of proteomics in the context of ecotoxicology, focusing mainly on the prospective research to be done in invertebrates. Although these represent around 95% of all animal species and in spite of the key structural and functional roles they play in ecosystems, proteomic research in invertebrates is still in an incipient stage. We will review applications of ecotoxicoproteomics by evaluating the technical methods employed, the organisms and the contexts studied, the advances achieved until now and lastly the limitations yet to overcome will be discussed.

The convergence of lung cancer rates between blacks and whites under the age of 40, United States. Lung cancer rates in the United States have been consistently higher in blacks than in whites at all ages in men and at younger ages in women. However, since the 1970s, smoking initiation decreased more rapidly among blacks than whites. We examined trends in lung cancer rates for white and black young adults (ages 20-39) from 1992 to 2006 using joinpoint models and black-to-white rate ratios by sex. Lung cancer death rates in 20- to 39-year-olds significantly decreased in all groups but was much steeper for blacks than for whites. From 1992 to 1994 and 2004 to 2006, the black-to-white mortality rate ratio (95% confidence interval) decreased from 2.16 (1.90-2.44) to 1.28 (1.05-1.55) for men and from 1.47 (1.25-1.71) to 0.97 (0.78-1.19) for women. A similar convergence was observed in the lung cancer incidence rates. These findings suggest that if current smoking trends in the young continue, racial differences in overall lung cancer rates in men will be eliminated in the next 40 to 50 years.

Plant-derived alternative treatments for the aging male: facts and myths. Soy- or red clover- derived products containing isoflavones have been amply studied in climacteric and postmenopausal women, and confusing contradicting results have been published. The beneficial effects on climacteric complaints, cholesterol and the development of osteoporosis are marginally at best and there are no uterine and mammary safety studies. In males, however, isoflavones may protect the prostate to make them less prone to develop cancer. Cell biological and animal experimental data support this notion. Clinical data about possible beneficial effects on cholesterol or in the bone are largely missing. Hence, soy or red clover products containing the mild estrogenic isoflavones with a slightly higher affinity to the estrogen receptor of the beta in comparison to the alpha subtype may prove to have some beneficial effects in males.

Acoustic and articulatory features of diphthong production: a speech clarity study. The purpose of this study was to evaluate how speaking clearly influences selected acoustic and orofacial kinematic measures associated with diphthong production. Forty-nine speakers, drawn from the University of Wisconsin X-Ray Microbeam Speech Production Database (J. R. Westbury, 1994), served as participants. Samples of clear and conversational productions of the word combine were extracted for analysis. Analyses included listener ratings of speech clarity and a number of acoustic and articulatory kinematic measures associated with production of the diphthong /aI/. Key results indicate that speaking clearly is associated with (a) increased duration of diphthong-related acoustic and kinematic events, (b) larger F1 and F2 excursions and associated tongue and mandible movements, and (c) minimal evidence of change in formant transition rate. Overall, the results suggest that clarity-related changes in diphthong production are accomplished through larger, longer, but not necessarily faster diphthong-related transitions. The clarity-related adjustments in diphthong production observed in this study conform to a simple model that assumes speech clarity arises out of reduced overlap of articulatory gestures.

Evaluation of the autonomic nervous system for fall detection. Studies show that the proportion of elderly will reach 30% of the total population by 2050 in developed countries, such as France. The elderly live generally alone, thus many health problems related to age are under reported. Falling is one of these problems and several devices have been developed recently, based on accelerometers, in order to detect it and alert carers. In order to improve the detection success of these devices, we propose quantifying autonomic nervous system activity (ANS) using a wearable ambulatory device developed for this purpose. We studied the A.N.S's response on 7 adult subjects during simulated falls and standing-lying transitions. We implemented a classification method using the Support Vector Machine in order to classify these two situations using measured heart rate variability and electrodermal response. Good results (sensibility = 70.37%, specificity = 80%, positive predictor = 73.8%) were obtained using a Polynomial kernel (p = 5) for the support vector machine implementation.

Transcriptome Analysis of Beta macrocarpa and Identification of Differentially Expressed Transcripts in Response to Beet Necrotic Yellow Vein Virus Infection. Rhizomania is one of the most devastating diseases of sugar beet. It is caused by Beet necrotic yellow vein virus (BNYVV) transmitted by the obligate root-infecting parasite Polymyxa betae. Beta macrocarpa, a wild beet species widely used as a systemic host in the laboratory, can be rub-inoculated with BNYVV to avoid variation associated with the presence of the vector P. betae. To better understand disease and resistance between beets and BNYVV, we characterized the transcriptome of B. macrocarpa and analyzed global gene expression of B. macrocarpa in response to BNYVV infection using the Illumina sequencing platform. The overall de novo assembly of cDNA sequence data generated 75,917 unigenes, with an average length of 1054 bp. Based on a BLASTX search (E-value â¤ 10-5) against the non-redundant (NR, NCBI) protein, Swiss-Prot, the Gene Ontology (GO), Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases, there were 39,372 unigenes annotated. In addition, 4,834 simple sequence repeats (SSRs) were also predicted, which could serve as a foundation for various applications in beet breeding. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the two transcriptomes revealed that 261 genes were differentially expressed in infected compared to control plants, including 128 up- and 133 down-regulated genes. GO analysis showed that the changes in the differently expressed genes were mainly enrichment in response to biotic stimulus and primary metabolic process. Our results not only provide a rich genomic resource for beets, but also benefit research into the molecular mechanisms of beet- BNYV Vinteraction.

Role of short-term out patient video electroencephalography in diagnosis of paroxysmal disorders. To distinguish epileptic seizures from non-epileptic paroxysmal events, we often use video electroencephalography (EEG) recording. Long-term video electroencephalography recording for inpatients is of good value, but, it necessitates much resources (financial and manpower). There is some evidence suggesting that short-term video EEG (STVEEG) is useful, but its role in practice has yet to be evaluated. To assess the usefulness of STVEEG in the diagnosis of different paroxysmal disorders and classifying epilepsy if present. Thirty sex patients had STVEEG recordings (for 2h) during a 15 months period. A diagnostic event was recorded in 21 of 36 (58.3%) within the first 2h of monitoring: PNES (n=11), epilepsy (n=5), and other paroxysmal disorders e.g. syncope, hemifacial spasm, movement disorder (n=5). STVEEG is a useful diagnostic technique in diagnosis of different paroxysmal disorders and it can be used as a successful screening test for saving other resources like prolonged inpatient video EEG recording.

[Orexin-A in hepatic reperfusion-induced liver injury in rats]. To explore the change of orexin-A expression in hepatic reperfusion and their association with liver injury, and to find out the role of orexin-A in traumatic stress responses. A 70% hepatic reperfusion model of rats was established, setting groups of sham-operation and injury ones with different reperfusion time. A self-produced radioimmunoassay and relevant kits were used to detect the protein level of orexin-A in the plasma and the hypothalamus, serum glucose, total anti-oxidation capacity and alanine transaminase, HE staining and immunohistochemistry were used to investigate the pathological variation and protein expression of orexin-A in the liver, while RT-PCR was applied to observe mRNA expression of orexin-A in the hypothalamus and the liver. Both the shape of standard curve and metrical results of the self-produced orexin-A radioimmunoassay were good. Protein levels of orexin-A in the plasma and the hypothalamus in each reperfusion group showed no significant change. Serum glucose and total anti-oxidation capacity increased significantly at the later phase of injury. There was significant and positive linear correlation between the plasma orexin-A and serum glucose and total anti-oxidation capacity; serum alanine transaminase in each reperfusion group was significantly higher, and liver damage was significantly alleviated at the later phase of the injury. Different extents of variation were observed in protein expression of orexin-A in the liver and its mRNA expression in the hypothalamus and the liver. Orexin-A undergoes significant changes during hepatic reperfusion, indicating that orexin-A participates in the modulation of hepatic reperfusion-induced liver injury and internal disorders.

Overexpression of PIP5KL1 suppresses the growth of human cervical cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. PIP5KL1 (phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase-like 1), the fourth member of PIP5Ks (phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinases) type I, acts as a scaffold for localization and activation of PIP5Ks, which in turn regulate numerous cellular processes. However, the role of PIP5KL1 in the development of human cancer is poorly studied. In this study, we established a stable clone of PIP5KL1 overexpressing human cervical cancer HeLa cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) and Western immunoblot analysis were performed to testify the mRNA and protein levels of PIP5KL1 in HeLa cells. The effect of PIP5KL1 overexpression on in vitro cell growth was assessed by measuring cell proliferation and migration. The athymic nude mouse model was used to examine the effects of PIP5KL1 on tumour growth in vivo. Stable transfection of PIP5KL1 induced a significant increase in expression of both mRNA and protein levels and consequent robust inhibition of proliferation (P<0.05) and migration (P<0.05) of HeLa cells. Overexpression of PIP5KL1 significantly suppressed the growth of HeLa xenograft tumours in the flanks of nude mice. Taken together, these studies indicate a functional negative correlation between elevated levels of PIP5KL1 and the development of human cervical cancer, suggesting that PIP5KL1 overexpression may suppress cervical cancer formation.

Epidemiology of National Collegiate Athletic Association Women's Gymnastics Injuries, 2009-2010 Through 2013-2014. Recent injury-surveillance data for collegiate-level women's gymnastics are limited. In addition, researchers have not captured non-time-loss injuries (ie, injuries resulting in restriction of participation <1 day). To describe the epidemiology of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) women's gymnastics injuries during the 2009-2010 through 2013-2014 academic years. Descriptive epidemiology study. Aggregate injury and exposure data collected from 11 women's gymnastics programs providing 28 seasons of data. Collegiate student-athletes participating in women's gymnastics during the 2009-2010 through 2013-2014 academic years. Women's gymnastics data from the NCAA Injury Surveillance Program (ISP) during the 2009-2010 through 2013-2014 academic years were analyzed. Injury rates; injury rate ratios; injury proportions by body site, diagnosis, and apparatus; and injury proportion ratios were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The ISP captured 418 women's gymnastics injuries, a rate of 9.22/1000 athlete-exposures (AEs; 95% CI = 8.33, 10.10). The competition injury rate (14.49/1000 AEs) was 1.67 times the practice injury rate (8.69/1000 AEs; 95% CI = 1.27, 2.19). When considering time-loss injuries only, the injury rate during this study period (3.62/1000 AEs) was lower than rates reported in earlier NCAA ISP surveillance data. Commonly injured body sites were the ankle (17.9%, n = 75), lower leg/Achilles tendon (13.6%, n = 57), trunk (13.4%, n = 56), and foot (12.4%, n = 52). Common diagnoses were ligament sprain (20.3%, n = 85) and muscle/tendon strain (18.7%, n = 78). Overall, 12.4% (n = 52) of injuries resulted in time loss of more than 3 weeks. Of the 291 injuries reported while a student-athlete used an apparatus (69.6%), most occurred during the floor exercise (41.9%, n = 122) and on the uneven bars (28.2%, n = 82). We observed a lower time-loss injury rate for women's gymnastics than shown in earlier NCAA ISP surveillance data. Safety initiatives in women's gymnastics, such as "sting mats," padded equipment, and a redesigned vault table, may have contributed to minimizing the frequency and severity of injury.

Equivalency for father and mother ratings of the ADHD symptoms. The study used multiple-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) procedures to examine the measurement and construct equivalencies for father and mother ratings of ADHD symptoms, recoded as binary scores. Fathers (N = 387) and mothers (N = 411) rated their primary school-aged children on the Disruptive Behavior Rating Scale (Barkley & Murphy, 1998). For the multiple-group CFA analyses, the results involving differences in practical fit indices supported full measurement and construct equivalencies, whereas the chi-square difference test showed lack of equivalency in five symptoms for factor loadings, four symptoms for error variance, and the variance and mean scores for the hyperactivity-impulsivity factor. For the MIMIC analyses, six symptoms lacked equivalency for thresholds. These findings extend existing data in this area. The theoretical, psychometric and clinical implications of the findings are discussed.

A neural mechanism of synergy formation for whole body reaching. The present study proposes a computational model for the formation of whole body reaching synergy, i.e., coordinated movements of lower and upper limbs, characterized by a focal component (the hand must reach a target) and a postural component (the center of mass must remain inside the support base). The model is based on an extension of the equilibrium point hypothesis that has been called Passive Motion Paradigm (PMP), modified in order to achieve terminal attractor features and allow the integration of multiple constraints. The model is a network with terminal attractor dynamics. By simulating it in various conditions it was possible to show that it exhibits many of the spatio-temporal features found in experimental data. In particular, the motion of the center of mass appears to be synchronized with the motion of the hand and with proportional amplitude. Moreover, the joint rotation patterns can be accounted for by a single functional degree of freedom, as shown by principal component analysis. It is also suggested that recent findings in motor imagery support the idea that the PMP network may represent the motor cognitive part of synergy formation, uncontaminated by the effect of execution.


Application of rpoB and zinc protease gene for use in molecular discrimination of Fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies.

Synergistic enhancement of cancer therapy using a combination of carbon nanotubes and anti-tumor drug. In previous pharmacological applications, single-wall carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have primarily been explored as potential drug carriers and delivery vehicles. Here, we investigate and demonstrate for the first time, that CNTs can be considered as anti-tumor agents and, when in combination with conventional drugs, can significantly enhance their chemotherapeutic effects. HeLa and human Panc1 cancer cells were treated with CNTs (24 h, 10 and 20 microg/ml), etoposide (6 h, 75 x 10(-6) M) and their combination. The cell viability was controlled by flow cytometry, caspase-3 assay and trypan blue dye. A highly increased anti-tumor activity of the combination of etoposide and CNTs against cancer cells, compared with the administration of etoposide and CNTs alone, is reported. Data provided by viability assays suggest a strong interaction between CNTs and the cellular structures, thereby improving the effectiveness of conventional chemotherapeutic agents. We believe this finding could lead to the development of new cancer therapies by carefully selecting the cytostatic drugs and nanostructural materials that, in combination, may provide synergistic curative rates.

A case of tuberculous arthritis following the use of etanercept. Etanercept is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor that has been used for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriatic arthritis. Because of its immunosuppressive activity, opportunistic infections have been noted in treated patients, most notably caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Tuberculosis may present in an extrapulmonary or disseminated form. Since TNF-alpha inhibitors have been used in Korea, a few cases of TNF-alpha inhibitor associated tuberculosis have been described. However, tuberculous arthritis has not been previously reported. We describe a case of tuberculous arthritis in a 57-year-old woman with rheumatoid arthritis who was treated with etanercept.

Elucidation of the Pattern of the Onset of Male Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms Using Cluster Analysis: Efficacy of Tamsulosin in Each Symptom Group. To present a new grouping of male patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) based on symptom patterns and clarify whether the therapeutic effect of Î±1-blocker differs among the groups. We performed secondary analysis of anonymous data from 4815 patients enrolled in a postmarketing surveillance study of tamsulosin in Japan. Data on 7 International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) items at the initial visit were used in the cluster analysis. IPSS and quality of life (QOL) scores before and after tamsulosin treatment for 12Â weeks were assessed in each cluster. Partial correlation coefficients were also obtained for IPSS and QOL scores based on changes before and after treatment. Five symptom groups were identified by cluster analysis of IPSS. On their symptom profile, each cluster was labeled as minimal type (cluster 1), multiple severe type (cluster 2), weak stream type (cluster 3), storage type (cluster 4), and voiding type (cluster 5). Prevalence and the mean symptom score were significantly improved in almost all symptoms in all clusters by tamsulosin treatment. Nocturia and weak stream had the strongest effect on QOL in clusters 1, 2, and 4 and clusters 3 and 5, respectively. The study clarified that 5 characteristic symptom patterns exist by cluster analysis of IPSS in male patients with LUTS. Tamsulosin improved various symptoms and QOL in each symptom group. The study reports many male patients with LUTS being satisfied with monotherapy using tamsulosin and suggests the usefulness of Î±1-blockers as a drug of first choice.

Ipsilateral directional encoding of joystick movements in human cortex. The majority of Brain Computer Interfaces have relied on signals related to primary motor cortex and the operation of the contralateral limb. Recently, the physiology associated with same-sided (ipsilateral) motor movements has been found to have a unique cortical physiology. This study sets out to assess whether more complex motor movements can be discerned utilizing ipsilateral cortical signals. In this study, three invasively monitored human subjects were recorded while performing a center out joystick task with the hand ipsilateral to the hemispheric subdural grid array. It was found that directional tuning was present in ipsilateral cortex. This information was encoded in both distinct anatomic populations and spectral distributions. These findings support the notion that ipsilateral signals may provide added information for BCI operation in the future.

A randomized phase II study of the clinical effects of ultrasonically activated coagulating shears (Harmonic scalpel) in open gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The Harmonic Ace ultrasonic scalpel has been popular in abdominal surgery; however, only a few clinical studies have evaluated the efficacy of this device in radical open gastrectomy for gastric cancer. The present study was designed as a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients with resectable gastric cancer were randomly assigned to gastrectomy using the Harmonic scalpel or conventional monopolar electrosurgery. A total of 248 patients were enrolled, and 123 patients were included in the Harmonic group and 114 patients were included in the conventional group. The demographics of the patients were well balanced between the groups. There was no significant difference in the length of the operation from skin incision to resection of the gastric specimen (141Â Â±Â 36Â min in the Harmonic group vs. 147Â Â±Â 13Â min in the conventional group; pÂ =Â 0.276) nor in the amount of blood lost (365Â Â±Â 293 vs. 336Â Â±Â 272Â mL; pÂ =Â 0.434). There was also no significant difference in the incidence of surgical complications or the post-surgical hospital stay between the groups. The Harmonic scalpel procedure was not superior to the conventional monopolar electrosurgery with regard to reducing the length of the operation, blood loss, postoperative complications, or postoperative hospital stay in radical open gastrectomy.

Roles of amylin in satiation, adiposity and brain development. Amylin plays an important role in the control of nutrient fluxes. It is cosecreted with insulin and reduces eating by promoting meal-ending satiation. This effect seems to depend on a stimulation of amylin receptors in the area postrema. Subsequent to area postrema activation, the neural signal is conveyed to the forebrain via distinct relays in the nucleus of the solitary tract and the lateral parabrachial nucleus to the lateral hypothalamic area and other hypothalamic nuclei; the functional roles of these relays in amylin's eating inhibitory effect have not been fully investigated. Amylin may also play a role in the regulation of adiposity. Plasma levels of amylin are increased in adiposity, although the precise relation is unknown. Furthermore, chronic infusion of amylin into the brain reduced body weight gain and adiposity, and chronic infusion of an amylin receptor antagonist increased body adiposity. Both these animal data and pre-clinical research in humans indicate that amylin is a promising option for anti-obesity therapy, especially in combination with leptin. Finally, recent findings indicate that amylin may also be necessary for normal brain development; it acts as a neurotrophic factor for the development of brainstem pathways involved in the control of eating. How this may be relevant under physiological conditions requires further studies, but these findings substantiate the concept that amylin plays an integrative role in the development and operation of neural circuits involved in the control of eating and energy homeostasis.

Percutaneous aortic valve implantation in patients with coronary artery disease: review of therapeutic strategies.

[Evaluation of the Safety of a Generic Formulation of Cisplatin in Patients with Thoracic Malignancies]. Cisplatin (CDDP) is a key drug in the systemic treatment of various solid tumors. Brand-name CDDP may differ across generic formulations considering various clinical parameters. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess the safety of a generic CDDP formulation. To compare brand-name CDDP with a generic formulation, the incidence of adverse events, especially renal toxicity, was investigated in 500 patients with thoracic malignancies who received chemotherapy with more than 60 mg/m2 of either brand-name or generic CDDP. We compared the maximum serum creatinine (Cr) level after chemotherapy in the 2 groups. The correlation coefficients between the pretreatment Cr and the maximum Cr after CDDP administration did not differ between brand-name CDDP and generic CDDP (0.610 and 0.644, respectively; p=0.528). Furthermore, the correlation coefficients did not differ in subgroup analysis according to sex or adjuvant therapy. The severity of adverse events was similar in the 2 groups. In conclusion, generic CDDP can safely be used as an alternative to brand-name CDDP in the clinical setting.

Effect of triterpene acids of Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl. leaf and MAPK signal transduction pathway on inducible nitric oxide synthase expression in alveolar macrophage of chronic bronchitis rats. The goal of this study was to investigate the possible therapy mechanism of triterpene acids of Eriobotrya japonica (Thunb.) Lindl. Leaf (TAL) in alveolar macrophage (AM) of chronic bronchitis (CB) rats. CB model was established by injection of bacillus calmette guein (BCG) plus lipopolisacharide (LPS) in rats. TAL significantly inhibited the increased NO concentration, iNOS expression and phosphorylation of p38 MAPK in alveolar macrophages (AMs) of CB rats. Using in vivo test, we found that SB203580, a p38 MAPK inhibitor, (10 muM) significantly inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression in AM. This data indicate that TAL highly decreases excessive iNOS expression and NO induction, and p38 MAPK signal transduction participates in iNOS expression and NO induction in AM of CB rats. The effect of TAL on iNOS expression in AM may be related to its inhibition of p38 MAPK signal transduction.

[Inhibitory effects of enhanced expression of CD40L in ovarian cancer OVHM cells on the liver metastases in mice]. To examine the in vivo anti-metastatic effect of enhanced expression of CD40L cDNA in murine ovarian cancer OVHM cells (CD40L-OVHM) injected into the spleen on liver metastasis in mice. OVHM cells were inoculated into the spleen of 6 to 8 week-old female B6C3F1 (C57BL/6N x C3H/He) mice. The established liver metastasis was identified by histopathology (HE staining). OVHM cells, DNA-pMKITneo-OVHM cells or CD40L-OVHM cells were inoculated into the spleen of female B6C3F1 mice and the expressions of CD11c in splenic cells were detected by flow cytometry. The specific cytotoxicity of splenic cells was detected by MTT assay, and the serum cytokines of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-12, IL-4 and IL-10 of the mice were measured by enzyme linked immunoabsorbent assay. The liver metastases and the survival time of the mice were also recorded. The mouse models with liver metastasis by injecting tumor cells into the spleen of mice were established. The expression of CD11c and the specific killing rate in CD40L-OVHM cells group was significantly higher than that in the OVHM cells group and DNA-pMKITneo-OVHM cells group. The expressions of IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-12 in the CD40L-OVHM cells group were much more increased than OVHM cells group and DNA-pMKITneo-OVHM cells group, but the expressions of IL-4 and IL-10 in the CD40L-OVHM cells group were decreased significantly (p < 0.05). The average weights of livers and spleens of mice in CD40L-OVHM cells group were significantly lower than those of DNA-pMKITneo-OVHM cells group and OVHM cells group. The survival time of mice in CD40L-OVHM cells group was also significantly longer than that in the OVHM cells group and DNA-pMKITneo-OVHM cells group (P < 0.05). The data directly demonstrate that the expression of CD40L in ovarian cancer cells (CD40L-OVHM) can enhance the proliferation and differentiation of dendritic cells in the spleen and induce specific cytotoxic effect of T cells in the spleen, and may regulate the immune function of peripheral blood cells and the immune balance between Th1 cells and Th2 cells, which maybe the possible mechanism induced by CD40L in mice inhibiting the development of liver metastasis.

Assessing systolic time-intervals from heart sound: a feasibility study. Systolic time intervals are highly correlated to fundamental cardiac functions. In this paper we investigate the feasibility of using heart sound (HS) to accurately measure the opening and closing moments of the aortic valve, since these are crucial moments to define the main systolic timings of the heart cycle, i.e. the pre-ejection period (PEP) and the left ventricular ejection time (LVET). We introduce a HS model, which is applied to define several features that provide clear markers to identify these moments in the HS. Using these features and a comparative analysis with registered echocardiographies from 17 subjects, the results achieved in this study suggest that HS can be used to accurately estimate LVET and PEP.

The use of human tissue in epidemiological research; ethical and legal considerations in two biobanks in Belgium. This paper discusses the legal implications of setting up two new biobanks in Belgium. The first is hospital-based and will archive tissue from patients with haematologic cancer, whereas the second is linked to a general practice based morbidity registry and will involve storage of blood samples. To date, Belgium has no specific legislation that regulates storage of human tissue and related databases. Several issues concerning the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal medical data are discussed from the existing privacy legislation. We will address the principle of consent (broad versus specific) and the type of data recorded (anonymous, encoded and identifiable) for both biobanks.


[Analysis of the survival in patients after surgical resection of thoracic esophageal cancer].

The functional and compositional properties of lipoproteins are altered in patients with metabolic syndrome with increased cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity. To compare the molecular composition and functional differences at the lipoprotein level, we analyzed individual lipoprotein fractions from male patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) (n=10) and gender- and age-matched healthy controls (n=14). The MetS group had significantly higher obesity, blood pressure, serum cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), adiponectin, and uric acid levels than the control group, while the serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels of the MetS group were in the normal range. The MetS group had much weaker serum antioxidant ability and were more susceptible to copper-mediated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-oxidation. TG and apoC-III co-accumulated with LDL, high density lipoprotein (HDL)2, and HDL3 in the MetS group. The MetS group had serum amyloid A (SAA)-enriched HDL2 and HDL3, although the serum level of SAA was not higher than in controls. The MetS group had significantly deprived paraoxonase (PON) activity in the serum and HDL, while the MetS group had 38% higher serum cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity than that of the control group. Many serum parameters, such as TG, apoC-III, and uric acid, were elevated in the MetS group, and most of these measures were enriched in the LDL and HDL fractions rather than the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) fraction. The lipid and apolipoprotein composition of HDL was severely altered and its beneficial functions were severely diminished. ApoA-I level was more readily detected in lipoprotein-deficient serum of the MetS group, indicating that the apoA-I exists in a lipid-free state. These results suggest that the MetS group had dysfunctional HDL that enriched TG, apoC-III, CETP, and SAA without antioxidant activity.

Change of maternal thyroid function in twin-twin transfusion syndrome. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) has weak thyroid-stimulating activity because of its homology with thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). In twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), which is a severe complication of monochorionic twin pregnancies, a close association between maternal serum hCG concentration and TTTS has been reported. And, TTTS can be treated by fetoscopic laser coagulation of the communicating vessels. To clarify the relationship between maternal serum hCG and maternal thyroid function in TTTS, the present study investigated the change in thyroid hormone and hCG levels after laser therapy. The protocol included collection of serial maternal blood samples in TTTS before laser therapy, and at two and four weeks after laser therapy. For 131 cases of TTTS, the following parameters were determined at each point: hCG, TSH, free triiodothyronine (fT3), and free thyroxine (fT4). The multiple of the median (MoM) of pre-operative hCG concentration in TTTS was 5.39 MoM (interquartile range, 2.83 - 8.64). There was a moderate positive correlation between hCG and fT3 in TTTS pre-operatively (R = 0.22, P = 0.030). fT4 was also positively correlated with hCG (R = 0.33, P < 0.001). Some cases showed very high concentration in fT3. When laser therapy for TTTS was effective, the hCG concentration significantly decreased, and fT3 and fT4 decreased progressively in concert with the decrease in hCG. The relationship between hCG and thyroid function in TTTS supports the finding of TTTS as a novel etiology of hCG-mediated hyperthyroidism during pregnancy. 

[Non-fatal disseminated mucormycosis in a solid organ transplant]. Mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection occurring most frequently in immunocompromised patients. The pathogens are filamentous fungi, order of Mucorales. Disseminated mucormycosis is a severe, life treating disease. Early diagnosis is a major determinant for prognosis, however, it remains difficult. The management consists in an early antifungal therapy using lipid formulation of amphotericin B associated with an extensive surgical debridement. Despite this therapeutic of choice, the mortality of disseminated mucormycosis remains high. We report the case of disseminated mucormycosis in a 25 years old woman 9 months after a pulmonary transplantation. The clinical presentation included pulmonary and thyroid localization and the pathogen was Absidia corymbifera. The patient survived thanks to a large surgical debridement, and an early antifungal bitherapy by lipid formulation of amphotericin B and posaconazole. The re-emergence and the high mortality of mucormycosis in solid organ transplant receiver show the necessity to find new therapeutic approaches. Posaconazole associated with liposomal amphotericin B could be an interesting option to treat disseminated mucormycosis and improve their outcome.


Assessment of planning performance in clinical samples: Reliability and validity of the Tower of London task (TOL-F).

The control of fracture healing and its therapeutic targeting: improving upon nature. Fracture repair is a complex process involving timed cellular recruitment, gene expression, and synthesis of compounds that regenerate native tissue to restore the mechanical integrity, and thus function of injured bone. While the majority of fractures heal without complication, this takes time and a subset of patients ( approximately 10%) experience healing delays, extending their morbidity and treatment costs. Consequently, there is a need for efficacious therapeutics for the intervention of fracture healing. Recent studies into the molecular control of fracture repair and advances in the understanding of the skeleton as a whole have resulted in the identification of numerous novel targets and compounds for such intervention. These include traditional agents such bone morphogenetic proteins and other growth factors, but also relatively newer compounds such as parathyroid hormone and modulators of the Wnt signaling pathway. These agents, along with others, are discussed in the current article in terms of their investigative status and potential for clinical implementation. Hopefully, these agents, as well as others yet to be discovered, will demonstrate sufficient clinical utility for successful intervention of fracture healing. This may have significant implications for the duration of morbidity and costs associated with traumatic bone fractures.

Pharmacogenetic model of retinoic acid-induced dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. Therapeutic administration of retinoids is often accompanied with undesirable side effects, including an increase in lipid levels in up to 45% of treated patients. We tested the hypothesis of whether spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) and congenic SHR.PD-(D8Rat42-D8Arb23)/Cub (SHR-Lx) strains, differing only in a 14-gene region of chromosome 8 and previously shown to display differential sensitivity to the teratogenic effects of retinoic acid, could serve as a pharmacogenetic model set of the metabolic side effects of retinoid therapy. Male, 15-week old rats (n = 12/strain) of SHR and SHR-Lx strains were fed a high-sucrose diet for 2 weeks and subsequently treated either with all-trans retinoic acid (15 mg/kg) or only with a vehicle for 16 days (n = 6/strain/treatment), while still on the high-sucrose diet. We assessed the morphometric and metabolic profiles of all groups, including glucose tolerance tests, levels of insulin, adiponectin, free fatty acids, concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterol in 20 lipoprotein fractions under conditions of both high-sucrose diet and high-sucrose diet plus all-trans retinoic acid administration. SHR-Lx displayed substantially greater sensitivity to a number of all-trans retinoic acid-induced metabolic dysregulations compared with SHR, resulting in impairment of glucose tolerance, increased visceral adiposity, and substantially greater increase of circulating triglyceride concentrations, accompanied by a shift towards their less favorable distribution into the lipoprotein fractions. These observations closely mimic the common side effects of retinoid therapy in humans, rendering SHR-Lx an experimental pharmacogenetic model of atRA-induced dyslipidemia.

Who is that masked person: the use of face masks on Mexico City public transportation during the Influenza A (H1N1) outbreak. This article examines three issues: (1) the use, over time, of facemasks in a public setting to prevent the spread of a respiratory disease for which the mortality rate is unknown; (2) the difference between the responses of male and female subjects in a public setting to unknown risks; and (3) the effectiveness of mandatory and voluntary public health measures in a public health emergency. The use of facemasks to prevent the spread of respiratory diseases in a public setting is controversial. At the height of the influenza epidemic in Mexico City in the spring of 2009, the federal government of Mexico recommended that passengers on public transport use facemasks to prevent contagion. The Mexico City government made the use of facemasks mandatory for bus and taxi drivers, but enforcement procedures differed for these two categories. Using an evidence-based approach, we collected data on the use of facemasks over a 2-week period. In the specific context of the Mexico City influenza outbreak, these data showed mask usage rates mimicked the course of the epidemic and gender difference in compliance rates among metro passengers. Moreover, there was not a significant difference in compliance with mandatory and voluntary public health measures where the effect of the mandatory measures was diminished by insufficiently severe penalties, the lack of market forces to create compliance incentives and sufficient political influence to diminish enforcement. Voluntary compliance was diminished by lack of trust in the government.


[Effect of strong stimulation of acupuncture at twelve Jing-well points as main for neurosurgery patients with disorder of consciousness].

A high-throughput method for determining chloramphenicol residues in poultry, egg, shrimp, fish, swine and bovine using LC-ESI-MS/MS. A LC-ESI-MS/MS method for determining chloramphenicol residues in fish, shrimp, poultry, eggs, bovine and swine was developed and validated. The samples were extracted with a phosphate extraction solution followed by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate. The LC was performed on a C18 column at room temperature. For all the matrices, the analytical curves showed r values and recoveries higher than 0.99 and 50%, respectively. The accuracy values lay between 85 and 120% and the precision was lower than 20%. The LOQ was 0.1 ng/g. The method was employed to analyze samples collected in Brazil.


Absence of ERRalpha in female mice confers resistance to bone loss induced by age or estrogen-deficiency.

EORTC study 26041-22041: phase I/II study on concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide (TMZ) and radiotherapy (RT) with PTK787/ZK222584 (PTK/ZK) in newly diagnosed glioblastoma. Glioblastoma is a highly vascularised tumour with a high expression of both vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGFR. PTK787/ZK222584 (PTK/ZK, vatalanib), a multiple VEGF receptor inhibitor, blocks the intracellular tyrosine kinase activity of all known VEGF receptors and is therefore suitable for long-term therapy of pathologic tumour neovascularisation. The study was designed as an open-label, phase I/II study. A classic 3+3 design was selected. PTK/ZK was added to standard concomitant and adjuvant treatment, beginning in the morning of day 1 of radiotherapy (RT), and given continuously until disease progression or toxicity. PTK/ZK doses started from 500 mg with subsequent escalations to 1000 and 1250 mg/d. Adjuvant or maintenance PTK after the end of radiochemotherapy was given at a previously established dose of 750 mg twice daily continuously with TMZ at the standard adjuvant dose. Twenty patients were enrolled. Dose-limiting toxicities at a once daily dose of 1250 mg were grade 3 diarrhoea (n=1), grade 3 ALT increase (n=2), and myelosuppression with grade 4 thrombocytopenia and neutropenia (n=1). The recommended dose of PTK/ZK in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide (TMZ) is 1000 mg once a day. This treatment is safe and well tolerated. In our phase I study once daily administration of up to 1000 mg of PTK/ZK in conjunction with concomitant temozolomide and radiotherapy was feasible and safe. Prolonged administration of this oral agent is manageable. The planned randomised phase II trial was discontinued right at its onset due to industry decision not to further develop this agent.

Malaria vector composition and insecticide susceptibility status in Guinea Conakry, West Africa. This study provides data on malaria vector species composition and insecticide susceptibility status from three localities in Guinea Conakry. A total of 497 mosquitoes were collected resting indoors and morphologically identified as belonging to the Anopheles gambiae complex. The majority of these were An. gambiae s.s. (99.6%), but a small percentage (0.4%) were identified as Anopheles arabiensis. Thirty-four Anopheles funestus s.s. were also collected. The molecular S form of An. gambiae s.s. was predominant over the M form in Siguiri (95%) and Boffa (97.4%), whereas at Mt Nimba the M form was more abundant (61.4%) than the S form (38.1%). One hybrid M/S specimen was recorded from Mt Nimba. Siguiri populations showed high levels of resistance to DDT, dieldrin and bendiocarb. Anopheles gambiae from Boffa were largely susceptible to the insecticides tested. At Mt Nimba, resistance to DDT and bendicocarb was detected. Biochemical enzyme analysis showed that an altered acetylcholinesterase is operating in the field at low levels. The frequency of the 1014F kdr allele in the An. gambiae S form was 0.24 at Siguiri and 0.14 at Mt Nimba. A single RR specimen was found in the M form. The heterogeneity in species composition and resistance profiles between sites requires vector control interventions to be tailored to each site based on the data collected from ongoing monitoring and surveillance.

Kids in the atrium: comparing architectural intentions and children's experiences in a pediatric hospital lobby. The study reported here adopts an interdisciplinary focus to elicit children's views about hospital environments. Based at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), Toronto, the research explores the ways in which designers and patients understand and use the eight-storey lobby, The Atrium, a monumental addition constructed in 1993. It is a public place that never closes; hundreds of children pass through the namesake atrium every day. Combining methodological approaches from architectural history and health sociology, the intentions and uses of central features of the hospital atrium are examined. Data were collected from observations, focused interviews, and textual and visual documents. We locate the contemporary atrium in a historical context of building typologies rarely connected to hospital design, such as shopping malls, hotels and airports. We link the design of these multi-storey, glass-roofed spaces to other urban experiences especially consumption as normalizing forces in the everyday lives of Canadian children. Seeking to uncover children's self-identified, self-articulated place within contemporary pediatric hospitals, we assess how the atrium--by providing important, but difficult-to-measure functions such as comfort, socialization, interface, wayfinding, contact with nature and diurnal rhythms, and respite from adjacent medicalized spaces--contributes to the well-being of young patients. We used theoretical underpinnings from architecture and humanistic geography, and participatory methods advocated by child researchers and theorists. Our findings begin to address the significant gap in understanding about the relationship between the perceptions of children and the settings where their healthcare occurs. The study also underlines children's potential to serve as agents of architectural knowledge, reporting on and recording their observations of hospital architecture with remarkable sophistication.

Beliefs towards mental illness in Turkish physiotherapy students. Mental health is a new area of specialization for physiotherapists. However, they usually meet patients with psychiatric co-morbidities secondary to other chronic diseases. It is important to explore the beliefs of future physiotherapists regarding mental illness in order to implement effective strategies to avoid possible stigmatizing attitudes that may interfere with the rehabilitation process. Moreover, the psychiatric field should be introduced to physiotherapists as a clinical and research area. Therefore, we aimed to question the beliefs of physiotherapy students regarding mental illness using the Beliefs towards Mental Illness Scale in two different universities in Turkey. The total score of 524 students was 46.5 Â± 14.5 out of 105 while the Dangerousness Subscale score was 21.2 Â± 5.8/40; Incurability and Poor Social and Interpersonal Skills Subscale score was 24.2 Â± 9.3/55 and Shame Subscale score was 1.1 Â± 1.9/10. Students who had a relationship with an individual having a mental problem and students who had consulted a psychiatrist/psychologist for any mental problem showed more positive beliefs. Future physiotherapists should be informed and trained regarding people with mental illness both to avoid stigma and to be aware of this area in physiotherapy settings. Therefore, it is important to implement new curricula for schools providing physiotherapy education including courses, lectures and clinical practices in the psychiatry field.

Inhaled corticosteroid therapy with nebulized beclometasone dipropionate. Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the most effective anti-inflammatory agents for the management of chronic persistent asthma and are therefore recommended as first-line antiasthmatic therapy in children and adults. In various settings, the administration of ICS via nebulizer rather than hand-held inhaler (HHI) may have certain advantages, as many patients with HHI fail to use these devices properly or efficiently. In particular, young children, the elderly, the acutely ill, and those with restricted dexterity may be unable to coordinate inhalation with actuation of the device or to generate sufficient inspiratory flow to operate breath-actuated devices effectively. Compliance with nebulized therapy may also be better than that with a pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) plus spacer. Systematic reviews conclude that there is no significant difference in clinical effects between nebulizers and HHI. Performance and clinical effect of nebulization are influenced by several technical aspects such as the nebulizer-drug combination, nebulizer type, output and lung deposition. Among the currently available ICS, nebulized beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) has been in clinical use for more than 35 years, and has demonstrated marked clinical efficacy and a favorable tolerability profile in children and adults with chronic persistent asthma. The clinical efficacy of nebulized beclometasone is discussed in the present review using data from 13 published studies, which included a total of 1250 patients. Three multicenter, randomized, double-blind studies showed that nebulized BDP is as effective as BDP via pMDI plus spacer in a 2:1 dose ratio. Controlled trials involving 497 adults and children demonstrated similar clinical efficacy between nebulized BDP and either nebulized fluticasone propionate or nebulized budesonide. In all these trials, treatment-related adverse effects were generally uncommon, most were mild-to-moderate in severity, and most were associated with the respiratory system. Meta-analyses show that BDP, like other inhaled corticosteroids, has no major influence on patient height, urinary cortisol concentration, or bone metabolism, thus suggesting the absence of growth retardation or any marked effect on adrenal function or the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis when used in the approved dose range. Overall, nebulized BDP appears to have a particularly important place in asthma therapy: as a general alternative to HHIs (e.g. in patients with poor HHI compliance); when patients such as children or the elderly are unable to operate HHIs because of poor hand-lung coordination, lack of cooperation, or low inspiratory flow rate; and when high dosages of ICS are required, such as in adults with severe, corticosteroid-dependent asthma.

Inorganic fullerene-like tungsten disulfide nanocoating for friction reduction of nickel-titanium alloys. To fabricate a friction-reducing coating onto different nickel-titanium (NiTi) substrates using inorganic fullerene-like tungsten disulfide (IF-WS(2)) nanoparticles and to estimate in vitro friction reducing extent of the coating. Different NiTi substrates were coated with cobalt and IF-WS(2) nanoparticles film by the electrodeposition procedure. Coating composition analyses was made by scanning-electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray powder diffractometry and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Friction evaluation was carried out using standard tribological tests and an Instron system. Stable and well-adhered cobalt + IF-WS(2) coating of the NiTi substrates was obtained. Friction tests presented up to 66% reduction of the friction coefficient. NiTi alloy is widely used for many medical appliances; hence, this unique friction-reducing coating could be implemented to provide better manipulation and lower piercing rates.

A dimeric high-molecular-weight chymotrypsin inhibitor with antitumor and HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activities from seeds of Acacia confusa. A dimeric 70-kDa chymotrypsin inhibitor with substantial N-terminal sequence homology to serine protease inhibitors was isolated from Acacia confusa seeds. The chymotrypsin inhibitor was purified using a protocol that entailed ion exchange chromatography on Q-Sepharose, SP-Sepharose and fast protein liquid chromatography-gel filtration on Superdex 75. The chymotrypsin inhibitor was unadsorbed on both Q-Sepharose and SP-Sepharose. Its chymotrypsin inhibitory activity was stable from pH 3 to 10 and from 0 to 50 degrees C. It exerted antiproliferative activity toward breast cancer MCF-7 cells with an IC(50) of 10.7+/-4.2 microM. It inhibited HIV-1 reverse transcriptase with an IC(50) of 8+/-1.5 microM. It was devoid of antifungal activity toward a variety of fungal species. The distinctive features of the chymotrypsin inhibitor included dimeric nature, a high molecular mass, lack of trypsin inhibitory activity, highly potent HIV-1 reverse transcriptase inhibitory activity, specific antitumor activity and relatively high pH-stability.

Association of NOS3 Glu298Asp SNP with hypertension and possible effect modification of dietary fat intake in the ARIC study. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase breaks down nitric oxide and has a key role in blood pressure regulation. Earlier studies have shown associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the NOS3 gene and hypertension. Studies also suggest that such associations may vary by dietary fat intake. We investigated associations between the NOS3 Glu298Asp SNP (rs1799983) and hypertension, as well as the interaction between NOS3 genotypes and dietary fat intake using data from baseline examination in white and African American participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Community (ARIC) study. Dietary fat intake was measured by a Food Frequency Questionnaire during the baseline examination in 15 792 individuals aged 45-64 years in ARIC study participants. Race-stratified unconditional logistic regression was performed to investigate the association between prevalent hypertension and NOS3 Glu298Asp genotypes. There was no significant interaction between dietary fat intake and NOS3 Glu298Asp genotype with regards to hypertension status in either African Americans or whites (P for interaction=0.3 and 0.4, respectively). We found a significant relationship between NOS3 Glu298Asp and triglycerides in African Americans. We did not find an association between the NOS3 Glu298Asp polymorphism and hypertension, and dietary fat intake did not interact with NOS3 genotypes to influence hypertension. We recommend further exploration of the relationship between NOS3 Glu298Asp and triglycerides in African Americans.

Long-term results of mesocaval shunts with polytetrafluoroethylene grafts. Despite the introduction of new procedures such as pharmacologic reduction of portal pressure and endoscopic sclerotherapy, the role of surgery in portal hypertension must be reconsidered. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the long-term results of mesocaval interposition shunting in the treatment of recurrent variceal bleeding after sclerotherapy failure or in patients with intractable ascites in whom optimal medical treatments failed. Over a 20-year period, 85 patients (66 men and 19 women; mean age, 53.96 +/- 11.57 years) underwent a mesocaval interposition shunt procedure. Sixty-six patients had recurrent variceal bleeding, and 19 patients had refractory ascites. The underlying etiology of portal hypertension was alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 69), posthepatitis cirrhosis (n = 10), cryptogenic cirrhosis (n = 3), primary biliary cirrhosis (n = 2), and Budd-Chiari syndrome (n = 1). Thirty-one patients were in Child-Pugh grade A, 34 were in grade B, and 20 were in grade C. The mean diameter of the graft was 11.85 +/- 1.53 mm (range, 10-14 mm). Overall, in-hospital mortality was 10.5% (9 of 85 patients). There were 3 postoperative recurrences of variceal hemorrhage and 5 recurrent bleeds during the follow-up. The overall incidence of shunt thrombosis of this series was 10.5%. The total incidence of encephalopathy was 10.5%. Intraoperative gradient pressure measurements before and after shunt showed satisfactory pressure reduction (16.90 +/- 5.32 to 5.12 +/- 2.50/ mmHg; P < 0.0001). The mean follow-up period was 26.09 +/- 25.3 (range, 1-90) months. Nine patients (10.5%) later received liver transplants, with time intervals ranging from 2 months to 5 years. The actuarial survival rate was 92% at 1 year and 75% at 5 years. In our series, the interposition mesocaval shunt seems to be an effective procedure for the control of complications of portal hypertension in cirrhotic patients with good long-term results. Moreover, the procedure can be considered as a solution of choice in patients who are current liver transplant candidates, leaving the hepatic hilus intact.

Head trauma can initiate the onset of adreno-leukodystrophy. X-linked adreno-leukodystrophy and its adult variant, adrenomyeloneuropathy, are caused by mutations in ABCD1 that encodes a peroxisomal membrane protein of unknown physiological significance. In spite of identical mutations, they can have markedly divergent neurological and neuropathologic characteristics. Adreno-leukodystrophy classically presents in normal boys with mild neuropsychiatric features, which progress to frank neurological signs, the vegetative state and death in approximately three years. Adrenomyeloneuropathy typically affects young men with spastic paraparesis and sensory ataxia that can progress over decades. The neuropathologic correlate for adreno-leukodystrophy is severe inflammatory demyelination of posterior cerebral white matter, while a chronic distal axonopathy of spinal cord and peripheral nerve occurs in adrenomyeloneuropathy. Consequently, both modifier genes and environmental factors have been implicated in their pathogeneses. We report five cases of adreno-leukodystrophy whose onsets were initiated by moderate to severe head trauma, two of whom were conversions from adrenomyeloneuropathy. Their clinical courses were rapidly incapacitating, short (i.e., weeks to a few years) and fatal due to marked cerebral inflammatory demyelination. These cases, in concert with several previous reports, indicate that head trauma is one environmental factor that can have a profoundly deleterious effect on those genetically at risk for, or with milder clinical phenotypes of, this disease. Avoidance of potential head trauma and a rapid response to episodes of moderate to severe head trauma in this patient population seem prudent.

Primary repair vs. colostomy in colon injuries. Colon trauma is frequent and its prevalence is difficult to establish because of the different factors that intervene in its origin. In Mexico, traumatic colon injuries, albeit stab wounds or gunshot wounds, are on the rise. Our objective was to evaluate the most appropriate management for traumatic colon injuries. We conducted a retrospective study of 178 case files of patients with abdominal trauma and colon lesions during a 5-year period from January 2003 to June 2008 from the General Hospital of Balbuena, Mexico City. The study compared the use of primary closure vs. colostomy, analyzing variables such as sex, age, type of wound, severity of lesion and mortality. There were a total of 178 patients; 156 were male (87.6%) and 22 were female (12.4%). The most affected age group was between 21 and 30 years; 74 patients (41.6%) had stab wounds and 104 patients (58.4%) had gunshot wounds. Management consisted mainly of primary closure in 92 cases (51.7%) vs. colostomy in 86 patients (48.3%). However, 64% of gunshot wounds were treated with colostomy. Reported mortality was 9.55% and this was due to different factors such as multiple organ injury. Treatment of traumatic colon injury should be case specific, taking into account the mechanism of the lesion, its severity and associated injuries.

Absolute ethanol sclerotherapy for venous malformations in the face and neck. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the outcomes of sclerotherapy using absolute ethanol for venous malformations in the face and neck. We treated 60 consecutive patients with venous malformations in the face and neck with sclerotherapy with absolute ethanol under the guidance of digital subtraction angiography. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to evaluate the clinical outcomes of sclerotherapy. Complications were also evaluated. The duration of follow-up was a mean of 8 months (range, 3 to 22). Of the 60 patients, 22 were treated once and 38 were treated 2 to 18 times (mean 2.6 times/patient). The mean total volume of ethanol in 60 patients was 11.2 mL (range, 0.5 to 230 mL). Of the 60 patients, 56 had complete volume reduction and a marked response after treatment. No severe skin necrosis or permanent nerve damage occurred. Percutaneous sclerotherapy with absolute ethanol under the guidance of venography is a safe and effective treatment for venous malformations in the face and neck.

Characterization of age and cuticular hydrocarbon variation in mating pairs of house fly, Musca domestica, collected in the field. House flies, Musca domestica L., were collected in copula over two summers from six dairies located in three climatically distinct regions in the U.S.A. southern California, Minnesota and Georgia. Ages of males and females from a total of 511 mating pairs were estimated using pterin analysis. Cuticular hydrocarbon profiles and gonotrophic ages of females also were evaluated. Mean age of mating males ranged from 54 to 102 degree-days (DD) (4-10 days based on field air temperatures), depending on the farm. Very young males (< 10-20 DD) and old males (> 200 DD) were rare in mating pairs. Mean female age at mating ranged from 20 to 46 DD (2.5-4 days). All mating females had eggs in the early stages of vitellogenesis and 99.2% were nulliparous. However, some older and parous females were collected, demonstrating that re-mating can occur in the field. Head width measurements of mating pairs suggested that assortative mating by size did not occur. The cuticular hydrocarbon profiles of females were determined, with emphasis on (Z)-9-tricosene (muscalure). Overall, only 55% of mating females had detectable amounts (> 4 etag per fly) of (Z)-9-tricosene. Of the females that had detectable (Z)-9-tricosene, variation in amount per female was high in all fly populations, and thus was not statistically related to the size or age of the mating female. The proportion of mating females with detectable levels of (Z)-9-tricosene varied by geographic region. Seventy-one, 63, and 27% of females from southern California, Minnesota and Georgia had detectable amounts of (Z)-9-tricosene. Principal components analysis of the eight most abundant hydrocarbons from mating females, by state, revealed state-level distinctiveness of hydrocarbons in house fly populations, which may reflect genetic variation associated with environmental stresses in those geographical zones.


SIZ1, a small ubiquitin-related modifier ligase, controls cold signaling through regulation of salicylic acid accumulation.

Diverse effects of bacterial cell wall components on mast cell degranulation, cysteinyl leukotriene generation and migration. Nowadays there is more and more evidence that mast cells take part in antibacterial defence. Mast cells have the ability to kill bacteria via phagocytose-dependent or phagocytose-independent ways and express antimicrobial peptides that can directly kill pathogens at their site of entry. What is more, mast cells are capable of processing bacterial antigens for presentation through class I and II MHC molecules. Some data indicate that these cells can release various proinflammatory mediators in response to activation with bacteria and/or their products, however this information is still far from complete. Therefore, in this study we examined the ability of PGN from Staphylococcus aureus, LPS from Eschericha coli and LAM from Mycobacterium smegmatis to stimulate mature rat mast cell degranulation as well as cysteinyl LT generation. We also studied the influence of these bacterial components on mast cell migration. We found that PGN, LPS and LAM all failed to induce mast cell degranulation and histamine release. At the same time, activation of mast cells with these bacterial antigens resulted in generation and release of significant amounts of LT. Moreover, we documented that, even in the presence of laminin, none of the bacterial antigens used stimulated mast cell migration. However, PGN did induce migration of RANTES-primed mast cells, and LPS did stimulate mast cell migratory response after priming with IL-6. Our results show that PGN, LPS and LAM might be among the important bacterial antigens involved in mast cell activation during bacterial infection.

Can patient-written comments help explain patient satisfaction with food quality? This study identified themes in patient-written comments about meals served in a hospital and determined the relationship of those themes to patient food-quality satisfaction ratings among medical and surgical patients. Data from 2 years of quantitative Press Ganey patient-satisfaction ratings and qualitative comments related to meals by 1,077 patients discharged from a Midwest urban medical center were reviewed retrospectively. Themes in comments were identified. Results indicated that patient satisfaction with food quality did not differ based on sex or age, but did differ based on length of stay, perceived health status, and whether a patient provided written comments or not. The most common comments focused on the temperature of hot food, receiving what was ordered, and satisfaction with foodservice staff. The tenor of comments differed by food-quality rating given. Overall food quality rating was best predicted by food-related comments rather than comments about staff, or other issues not addressed in the Press Ganey quantitative questionnaire.


Predictive and reactive control of precision grip in children with congenital hemiplegia.

Correlation between thickening of the inner and outer retina and visual acuity in patients with epiretinal membrane. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between thickening of the inner and outer retinal layers and visual acuity in patients with idiopathic epiretinal membrane. We examined 30 eyes of 30 patients and 25 eyes of 25 healthy volunteers as age-matched normal control subjects. The inner (between the vitreoretinal interface and the outer border of inner plexiform layer), outer, and full retinal thickness at the fovea, parafovea, and perifovea were measured using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Thickening ratios of both the inner and outer retina were greater in the fovea than in the other macular regions (P < 0.0001). Inner foveal retinal thickening was significantly greater than outer foveal retinal thickening (P < 0.0001). However, outer retinal thickening in the fovea (r = 0.644, P < 0.001), parafovea (r = 0.616, P < 0.001), and perifovea (r = 0.410, P = 0.025) was significantly correlated with visual acuity; inner retinal thickening was not. Visual acuity tended to be worse, although not significantly so, in eyes with photoreceptor disruption. Epiretinal membrane-induced retinal damage associated with visual acuity seems to be located within the outer retina external to the inner plexiform layer.

Addressing the Shortage of Geriatricians: What Medical Educators Can Learn From the Nurse Practitioner Training Model. Physicians' career interest in geriatric medicine continues to wane at a time when the health care needs of older adults are increasing. Nurse practitioners have helped fill the U.S. physician gap by delivering outpatient care to older adults and can practice with full autonomy in many states. Nursing graduate school programs are preparing adult-gerontology primary care nurse practitioners to successfully deliver outpatient care services using a model of training with fewer requirements that is more flexible and of shorter duration compared with the training model for geriatricians. Nurse practitioners can also obtain initial certification and recertification with less time commitment and at lower cost than geriatricians. Whether the outpatient care provided by nurse practitioners is comparable to the care provided by physicians remains a subject of debate. However, as nurse practitioners' scope of practice expands, the perception exists that the outpatient clinical roles of adult-gerontology primary care nurse practitioners and geriatricians are similar. This raises questions about whether there are too many educational and certification requirements for geriatricians. The authors encourage medical educators to learn from the success of the nurse practitioner education model for training large numbers of primary care providers. They propose decreasing the duration of medical school and graduate medical education training for geriatricians and providing educational debt repayment programs as potential incentives to stimulate career interest in geriatric medicine.

[Recombinant expression of bovine chymosin in Pichia pastoris]. To express bovine chymosin in yeast, we amplified the prochymosin gene from the plasmid pMD18T-Prochy by PCR, and then cloned the gene into the expression vector pPICZaA, resulting in pPICZaA-Prochy. Pichia pastoris GS115 was used as host cells. Integration of the prochymosin cDNA into the Pichia pastoris genome was confirmed by PCR and sequencing analysis. Chymosin was expressed in Pichia pastoris successfully, and a strong band at about 37 kD was shown by SDS-PAGE. Activity tests showed that the chymosin activity of the culture supernatant was 12.2 SU/mL. This is the first report of successful expression of chymosin in Pichia pastoris. The recombinant Pichia pastoris strain obtained in this study could be further used to produce recombinant chymosin for cheese making.

Slacking by the human motor system: computational models and implications for robotic orthoses. Recent experimental evidence suggests that a fundamental property of the human motor system is that it "slacks"; that is, that it continuously attempts to decrease levels of muscle activation when movement error is small during repetitive motions. This paper reviews several computational models of slacking, and discusses implications of slacking for the design of robotic orthoses. For therapeutic applications of robotic orthoses, slacking may reduce human effort during rehabilitation training, with negative consequences for use-dependent motor recovery. For assistive applications of robotic orthoses, slacking may allow the motor system to learn to take advantage of force amplification provided by an orthosis, with positive consequences for human energy efficiency.

Household bush burning practice and related respiratory symptoms in Grenada, the Caribbean. The practice of household bush burning in Grenada occurs frequently, though it is not well documented. The effects of the emissions from bush burning on respiratory health of the population have never been researched in Grenada. The goal of the study was to measure the frequency of bush burning and to investigate the relationship between bush burning practice and respiratory health in Grenada. In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was used to gather information from households in the parishes of St. George and St. Andrew, Grenada. In total, 225 participants were recruited and their responses on household bush burning and respiratory symptoms were analyzed. Self-reported data showed that the practice of bush burning was conducted by 43% (n = 96) of the participants as a regular practice (every month) and 86% (n = 192) of participants stated that their neighbors burn bush regularly. The most common lower respiratory symptom associated with bush burning was dry cough (31.4%). The participants who engage in the practice of bush burning had a statistically significant, higher prevalence of sinusitis symptoms (OR: 2.1, CI 95%: 1.1-3.9) and had slightly higher prevalence of cough (OR: 1.6, CI 95%: 0.9-2.8). Prevalences of physician-diagnosed asthma and sinusitis were 12.3% and 31.2%, respectively. Conducting studies on the health effects of bush burning in different settings and with different practices, such as the household bush burning in our current study, could help to improve public health in the developing world. Household disposal of waste is a significant issue in the developing world. In particular, residential bush burning is a common practice in tropical regions. This study demonstrates that the common practice of bush burning in the Caribbean is associated with respiratory symptoms and demonstrates the need for better management of residential yard waste. Burning of yard waste results in potentially significant exposures to air pollution and therefore alternative disposal practices need to be available. There is a need to increase awareness of the importance of avoiding exposure to the air pollutants generated during bush burning among communities in the Caribbean.

Unconscious trauma patients: outcome differences between southern Finland and Germany-lesson learned from trauma-registry comparisons. International trauma registry comparisons are scarce and lack standardised methodology. Recently, we performed a 6-year comparison between southern Finland and Germany. Because an outcome difference emerged in the subgroup of unconscious trauma patients, we aimed to identify factors associated with such difference and to further explore the role of trauma registries for evaluating trauma-care quality. Unconscious patients [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 3-8] with severe blunt trauma [Injury Severity Score (ISS) â¥16] from Helsinki University Hospital's trauma registry (TR-THEL) and the German Trauma Registry (TR-DGU) were compared from 2006 to 2011. The primary outcome measure was 30-day in-hospital mortality. Expected mortality was calculated by Revised Injury Severity Classification (RISC) score. Patients were separated into clinically relevant subgroups, for which the standardised mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated and compared between the two trauma registries in order to identify patient groups explaining outcome differences. Of the 5243 patients from the TR-DGU and 398 from the TR-THEL included, nine subgroups were identified and analyzed separately. Poorer outcome appeared in the Finnish patients with penetrating head injury, and in Finnish patients under 60Â years with isolated head injury [TR-DGU SMRÂ =Â 1.06 (95Â % CIÂ =Â 0.94-1.18) vs. TR-THEL SMRÂ =Â 2.35 (95Â % CIÂ =Â 1.20-3.50), pÂ =Â 0.001 and TR-DGU SMRÂ =Â 1.01 (95Â % CIÂ =Â 0.87-1.16) vs. TR-THEL SMRÂ =Â 1.40 (95Â % CIÂ =Â 0.99-1.81), pÂ =Â 0.030]. A closer analysis of these subgroups in the TR-THEL revealed early treatment limitations due to their very poor prognosis, which was not accounted for by the RISC. Trauma registry comparison has several pitfalls needing acknowledgement: the explanation for outcome differences between trauma systems can be a coincidence, a weakness in the scoring system, true variation in the standard of care, or hospitals' reluctance to include patients with hopeless prognosis in registry. We believe, however, that such comparisons are a feasible method for quality control.

Vibrational resonances and CuB displacement controlled by proton motion in cytochrome c oxidase. Cytochrome c oxidase (CcO), found in the inner mitochondrial membranes or in many bacteria, catalyzes the four-electron reduction of molecular oxygen to water. Four protons are pumped across the inner mitochondrial membrane through CcO. In this study, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics and molecular dynamics calculations are used to probe the spectroscopic characteristics of the ferryl intermediates in the aa(3) CcO/O(2) reaction. These highly elaborate calculations, supported by several calculations on smaller model systems, demonstrate the sensitivity of vibrational frequencies on the Coulombic field of heme a(3) and their dependence on the distance of the adjacent Cu(B) to the heme a(3)-Fe atom. This distance seems to be associated with the protonation state of the heme a(3) propionate A, and we propose that it plays a crucial role on the mechanism of action of CcO. In detail, we link proton pumping activity in CcO enzyme (a) to a multiple (1:1:2) resonance among the frequencies of Fe(IV)=O bond stretching, the breathing mode of Histidine 411, and a bending mode of the His411-Fe(IV)=O species (aa(3) from Paracoccus denitrificans numbering) and (b) to Cu(B) displacement by electrostatic interactions toward the heme a(3) iron. We find that the vibrations of the His411-Fe(IV)=O unit become highly coupled depending on the protonation state of the heme a(3) ring A propionate/Asp399 pair, and we propose a mechanism for the resonance Raman enhancement of the bending mode delta(His411-Fe(IV)=O). Calculations on model systems demonstrate that the position of Cu(B) in relation to heme a(3) iron-oxo plays a crucial role in regulating that resonance. We also discuss the origin of the coupling between bending, delta(His411-Fe(IV)=O) and nu(Fe=O) stretching modes, and the role played by such vibrational coupling interactions or Cu(B) position in controlling functional properties of the enzyme, including electron/proton coupling as well as experimental spectra.

Appetite and gastrointestinal motility: role of ghrelin-family peptides. Eating disorders, obesity and cachexia endanger the lives of millions of people worldwide. Fortunately, in last decade, there has been a rapid and substantial progress toward uncovering the molecular and neural mechanisms by which energy imbalance develops. In 1999, ghrelin was identified as the first orexigenic gut-derived peptide. It stimulates appetite and controls the gastric motility and the acid secretion through the activation of the growth hormone secretagogue-receptor. After the discovery of ghrelin, other forms of ghrelin-related proteins were isolated from the rat stomach. The unmodified des-n-octanoyl form (des-acyl ghrelin) and the recent obestatin act through distinct receptors and contrarily to acyl ghrelin, show an anorexigenic activity. The finding that these three peptide hormones derive from the same precursor exert opposing physiological actions, highlights the importance of post-translational regulatory mechanisms. Further investigations are required to highlight the complexity of ghrelin physiology in order to better understand the mechanisms regulating the energy balance and provide a successful treatment of eating disorders, obesity and cachexia.

Neurological disorders in schizophrenia. Schizophrenia (SZ) is a complex, heterogeneous, and disabling psychiatric disorder that impairs multiple aspects of human cognitive, perceptual, emotional, and behavioral functioning. SZ is relatively frequent (prevalence around 1%), with onset usually during adolescence or early adulthood, and has a deteriorating course. The rapidly growing area of neuroimaging research has has found clear evidence of many cortical and subcortical abnormalities in individuals with SZ. In this article the most recent findings from multiple studies on neurological disorders in SZ are reviewed, and the authors make a strong argument for a neurological basis of the schizophrenic process.

Workplace productivity, employment issues, and resource utilization in patients with bipolar I disorder. To collect workplace productivity and healthcare utilization data from subjects with bipolar I disorder and compare the results with those from normative subjects. A cross sectional survey was administered to patients and recruiting physicians. Data collected included employment status, Endicott Workplace Productivity Scale (EWPS) results, healthcare resource utilization, and quality-of-life. In comparison with normative subjects, bipolar I subjects reported lower levels of work productivity (measured by the EWPS). Bipolar I subjects also reported more frequent outpatient visits and more prescribed pharmaceuticals. Bipolar I subjects were more likely to miss work, have worked reduced hours due to medical or mental health issues, receive disability payments, been involved in a crime, be uninsured or covered by Medicare, or have been fired or laid off. The study groups were age- and gender-matched to reduce the impact of selection bias associated with a non-randomized study design. Other potential limitations affecting the results of the study include recall bias and possibly an impact of different data collection methods (e.g. Internet versus telephone). Bipolar I disorder is associated with a negative effect on work productivity and resource utilization and is an appropriate disease management target for employers and healthcare decision makers.


The Drosophila DHR96 nuclear receptor binds cholesterol and regulates cholesterol homeostasis.

Detection of multiscale pockets on protein surfaces using mathematical morphology. Detection of pockets on protein surfaces is an important step toward finding the binding sites of small molecules. In a previous study, we defined a pocket as a space into which a small spherical probe can enter, but a large probe cannot. The radius of the large probes corresponds to the shallowness of pockets. We showed that each type of binding molecule has a characteristic shallowness distribution. In this study, we introduced fundamental changes to our previous algorithm by using a 3D grid representation of proteins and probes, and the theory of mathematical morphology. We invented an efficient algorithm for calculating deep and shallow pockets (multiscale pockets) simultaneously, using several different sizes of spherical probes (multiscale probes). We implemented our algorithm as a new program, ghecom (grid-based HECOMi finder). The statistics of calculated pockets for the structural dataset showed that our program had a higher performance of detecting binding pockets, than four other popular pocket-finding programs proposed previously. The ghecom also calculates the shallowness of binding ligands, R(inaccess) (minimum radius of inaccessible spherical probes) that can be obtained from the multiscale molecular volume. We showed that each part of the binding molecule had a bias toward a specific range of shallowness. These findings will be useful for predicting the types of molecules that will be most likely to bind putative binding pockets, as well as the configurations of binding molecules. The program ghecom is available through the Web server (http://biunit.naist.jp/ghecom).


The Haematological Malignancy Research Network (HMRN): a new information strategy for population based epidemiology and health service research.

Insulin-like growth factor-II and insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins in bovine cystic ovarian disease. Cystic ovarian disease (COD) is one of the most common reproductive disorders of cattle and is considered to have multifactorial aetiology. An accepted hypothesis involves neuroendocrinological dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis; however, the role of growth factors in COD has not been extensively investigated. The present study examines the potential role of members of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family in COD. Expression of genes encoding IGF-II and insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBPs) was examined and the distribution of IGF-II within the follicular wall was assessed immunohistochemically. Finally, the concentration of IGF-II protein was determined in follicular fluid. There was increased IGF-II mRNA in the wall of cystic follicles, mainly associated with granulosa cells. Additionally, there was significantly more IGF-II protein in granulosa and theca cells in cystic follicles, but no change in the concentration of IGF-II in follicular fluid. Total IGFBPs, assessed by western blotting, were similar in different structures. However, by discriminating each IGFBP a decrease was detected in IGFBP-2 expression in cystic follicles that may be related to the observed higher expression of IGF-II. In summary, the present study provides evidence to suggest that COD in cattle is associated with modifications in the IGF-II system.

The prostate of weaned pups is altered by maternal malnutrition during lactation in rats. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of maternal malnutrition during lactation on prostate growth and estradiol serum concentration in the prostate of pups. At delivery, nine Wistar rats were separated into three groups: control group (C) with free access to a standard laboratory diet containing 22% protein; protein-energy-restricted group (PER) with free access to an isoenergy and protein-restricted diet containing 8% protein; and energy-restricted group (ER) receiving standard laboratory diet in restricted quantities, which were calculated according to the mean ingestion of the PER group. All pups were killed at weaning. PER and ER groups presented a significant reduction in estradiol serum concentration (C = 73.8 +/- 4.6, PER = 48.7 +/- 3.2, ER = 59.7 +/- 5.5 pg mL(-1), P < 0.01), total prostatic acini (C = 24 190.0 +/- 716.5, PER = 20 290.0 +/- 631.4, ER = 19 550.0 +/- 759.1 microm(2); P < 0.01), lumen of the prostatic acini (C = 5 590.0 +/- 165.4, PER = 3 776.0 +/- 251.3, ER = 4 658.0 +/- 198.1 microm(2); P < 0.01) and epithelial area of the prostate dorsal lobe (C = 18 120.0 +/- 391.4, PER = 16 520.0 +/- 799.2, ER = 14 890.0 +/- 589.8 microm(2); P < 0.01). Testosterone concentration was significantly increased only in the PER group when compared with the C group (C = 0.09 +/- 0.01, PER = 0.44 +/- 0.04, ER = 0.15 +/- 0.03 ng mL(-1), P < 0.001). An adequate nutritional state in early life is important for normal growth of the prostate gland, which seem to be related to serum levels of estradiol.


Isolation and characterization of plantaricin ASM1: a new bacteriocin produced by Lactobacillus plantarum A-1.

Aeromonas caviae CB101 contains four chitinases encoded by a single gene chi1. Aeromonas caviae CB101 secretes four chitinases (around 92, 82, 70, and 55 kDa) into the culture supernatant. A chitinase gene chi1 (92 kDa) was previously studied. To identify the genes encoding the remaining three chitinases, a cosmid library of CB101 was constructed to screen for putative chitinase genes. Nine cosmid clones were shown to contain a chitinase gene on chitin plates. Surprisingly, all the positive clones contained chi1. In parallel, we purified the 55-kDa chitinase (Chi55) from the CB101 culture supernatant by continuous DEAE-Sepharose and Mono-Q anion exchange chromatography. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified chitinase exactly matched the N-terminal sequence of mature Chi1, indicating that the purified chitinase (Chi55) is a truncated form of Chi1. The N- and C-terminal domains of chi1 were cloned, expressed, and purified, separately. Western blots using anti-sera to the N- and C-terminal domains of chi1 on the chitinases of CB101 showed that the four chitinases in the culture supernatant are either chi1 or C-terminal truncations of Chi1. In addition, the CB101 chi1 null mutant showed no chitinolytic activity, while CB101 chi1 null mutant complemented by pUC19chi1 containing chi1 showed all four chitinases in gel activity assay. These data indicated that all four chitinases secreted by CB101 in the culture supernatant are the product of one chitinase gene chi1.

Steam reforming of crude glycerol with in situ CO(2) sorption. Steam reforming of the crude glycerol by-product of a biodiesel production plant has been evaluated experimentally at atmospheric pressure, with and without in situ CO(2) sorption, in a continuous flow fixed-bed reactor between 400 degrees C and 700 degrees C. The process outputs were compared to those using pure glycerol. Thermodynamic equilibrium calculations were used to assess the effect on the steam reforming process of the main crude impurities (methanol and four fatty acid methyl esters). The crude glycerol and steam conversions and the H(2) purity reached 100%, 11% and 68%, respectively at 600 degrees C. No CH(4) was found at and above 600 degrees C. Steam reforming of crude glycerol with in situ CO(2) removal is shown to be an effective means of achieving hydrogen purity above 88% in pre-CO(2) breakthrough conditions.


Inflammatory biomarker profiling in elderly patients with acute hip fracture treated with heparins.

Early replication in pulmonary B cells after infection with Marek's disease herpesvirus by the respiratory route. Abstract Natural infection with Marek's disease virus occurs through the respiratory mucosa after chickens inhale dander shed from infected chickens. The early events in the lung following exposure to the feather and squamous epithelial cell debris containing the viral particles remain unclear. In order to elucidate the virological and immunological consequences of MDV infection for the respiratory tract, chickens were infected by intratracheal administration of infective dander. Differences between susceptible and resistant chickens were immediately apparent, with delayed viral replication and earlier onset of interferon (IFN)-gamma production in the latter. CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells surrounded infected cells in the lung. Although viral replication was evident in macrophages, pulmonary B cells were the main target cell type in susceptible chickens following intratracheal infection with MDV. In accordance, depletion of B cells curtailed viremia and substantially affected pathogenesis in susceptible chickens. Together the data described here demonstrate the role of pulmonary B cells as the primary and predominant target cells and their importance for MDV pathogenesis.

Long-term results of early contact lens use in pediatric unilateral aphakia. To evaluate which factor(s) might predict excellent Snellen visual acuity results in unilateral nontraumatic pediatric aphakes. Retrospective review of all unilateral pediatric aphakic patients seen in a specialty contact lens clinic between 1982 and 2009. Inclusion criteria as follows: (1) cataract extraction before age 6 weeks, (2) no other health complications, (3) contact lens fitting within 3 weeks postsurgery, and (4) measurable subjective visual performance on a clinical Snellen acuity chart. Fifteen patients were identified: 10 patients with persistent fetal vasculature syndrome (PFV) and 5 patients with the diagnosis of idiopathic congenital cataract (ICC). Final Snellen acuity results showed seven patients (46.67%) developed excellent Snellen visual acuities (defined as 20/50 or better), four patients (26.67%) developed moderate Snellen visual acuities (20/125 to 20/60), and four total patients (26.67%) developed poor Snellen visual acuities (worse than 20/200). Analysis used descriptive statistics. Approximately 50% of our unilateral nontraumatic pediatric aphakic patients aged older than 5 years achieved excellent Snellen visual acuity in the aphakic eye. The amount of surgical or ocular complications seems to have an inverse relationship with Snellen visual acuity in PFV. Patching compliance, without implying cause-effect direction, also had a direct relationship with final Snellen visual acuity for patients. Early cataract extraction, good to moderate patching compliance, and aggressive early contact lens management can lead to moderate to excellent Snellen visual results in several unilateral pediatric aphakic patients.

Potential contributions of heat shock proteins to temperature-dependent sex determination in the American alligator. Sex determination in the American alligator depends on the incubation temperature experienced during a thermo-sensitive period (TSP), although sex determination can be 'reversed' by embryonic exposure to an estrogenic compound. Thus, temperature and estrogenic signals play essential roles during temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). The genetic basis for TSD is poorly understood, although previous studies observed that many of the genes associated with genetic sex determination (GSD) are expressed in species with TSD. Heat shock proteins (HSPs), good candidates because of their temperature-sensitive expression, have not been examined in regard to TSD but HSPs have the ability to modify steroid receptor function. A number of HSP cDNAs (HSP27, DNAJ, HSP40, HSP47, HSP60, HSP70A, HSP70B, HSP70C, HSP75, HSP90alpha, HSP90beta, and HSP108) as well as cold-inducible RNA binding protein (CIRBP) and HSP-binding protein (HSPBP) were cloned, and expression of their mRNA in the gonadal-adrenal-mesonephros complex (GAM) was investigated. Embryonic and neonatal GAMs exhibited mRNA for all of the HSPs examined during and after the TSP. One-month-old GAMs were separated into 3 portions (gonad, adrenal gland, and mesonephros), and sexual dimorphism in the mRNA expression of gonadal HSP27 (male > female), gonadal HSP70A (male < female), and adrenal HSP90 alpha (male > female) was observed. These findings provide new insights on TSD and suggest that further studies examining the role of HSPs during gonadal development are needed.


Autofluorescence imaging of cystoid macular edema in diabetic retinopathy.

An impedance method for spatial sensing of 3D cell constructs--towards applications in tissue engineering. We present the characterisation and validation of multiplexed 4-terminal (4T) impedance measurements as a method for sensing the spatial location of cell aggregates within large three-dimensional (3D) gelatin scaffolds. The measurements were performed using an array of four rectangular chambers, each having eight platinum needle electrodes for parallel analysis. The electrode positions for current injection and voltage measurements were optimised by means of finite element simulations to maximise the sensitivity field distribution and spatial resolution. Eight different 4T combinations were experimentally tested in terms of the spatial sensitivity. The simulated sensitivity fields were validated using objects (phantoms) with different conductivity and size placed in different positions inside the chamber. This provided the detection limit (volume sensitivity) of 16.5%, i.e. the smallest detectable volume with respect to the size of the measurement chamber. Furthermore, the possibility for quick single frequency analysis was demonstrated by finding a common frequency of 250 kHz for all the presented electrode combinations. As final proof of concept, a high density of human hepatoblastoma (HepG2) cells were encapsulated in gelatin to form artificial 3D cell constructs and detected when placed in different positions inside large gelatin scaffolds. Taken together, these results open new perspectives for impedance-based sensing technologies for non-invasive monitoring in tissue engineering applications providing spatial information of constructs within biologically relevant 3D environments.

Repair of osteochondral defects with adipose stem cells and a dual growth factor-releasing scaffold in rabbits. The purpose of this work was to evaluate the in vivo effectiveness of a TGF-beta(2) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-7-immobilized porous polycaprolactone (PCL)/F127 scaffold to enhance the healing of cartilage defect. An osteochondral defect was created on the patellar groove of the right distal femur of 12 rabbits and managed by one of the following methods: filling it with the scaffold only (Group I); the scaffold seeded with adipose stem cells (ASCs) (Group II); a TGF-beta(2) and BMP-7-immobilized scaffold (Group III); and a TGF-beta(2) and BMP-7-immobilized scaffold seeded with ASCs (Group IV). Each group had three rabbits. Nine weeks after the implantation, the implanted scaffolds were filled with yellowish, dense tissue, and had distinct margins with adjacent normal cartilage. The histological findings showed infiltration of foreign-body giant cells and blood vessel, more prominently in Groups III and IV. The presence of growth factor significantly increased the ICRS Macroscopic Score (p = 0.045) while the presence of ASC did not. The ICRS Visual Histological Score was not significantly affected by the presence of either growth factors or ASCs, showing similar values in all groups. In conclusion, the use of TGF-beta(2) and BMP-7-immobilized PCL/F127 scaffolds improved gross appearances of the osteochondral defects while not actually leading to better histological results and induced a greater degree of foreign body reaction.

Treating prehypertension: medically sound and economically viable. The 7th Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure provided new guide-lines for the definition and management of hypertension. Notably, a new category-"prehypertension"-was created for intermediate systolic pressures exceeding 120 mmHg, the upper limit of normal, but less than 139 mmHg, the threshold for stage 1 hypertension. The therapeutic consequences of this new classification are not yet clear, but research indicates that prehypertension is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular, cognitive, and renal morbidities as well as diabetes, and statistical data indicate that prehypertension is present in over 30% of US, European, and Asian adults. However, while pharmacotherapy is recommended for hypertension, the use of drugs to control prehypertension is under question. Given the serious health consequences linked with prehypertension, such debates seem misplaced if patient well-being is our priority. While acknowledging the lack of specific randomized controlled trial data on this topic, we suggest that anti-hypertensive therapy be recommended for everyone with prehypertension and address resulting cost-benefit issues.

Thrombus on the eustachian valve leading to recurrent pulmonary embolism: a rare problem requiring aggressive management. The eustachian valve is an embryological remnant of the inferior vena cava valve that is absent or inconspicuous in the adult. Even when prominent, it is considered to be a benign finding. The present report describes a patient with deep venous thrombosis who had recurrent pulmonary embolism despite thrombolysis and anticoagulation. He was found to have an adherent thrombus on the eustachian valve and his symptoms resolved completely following surgical thrombectomy. The present report highlights that the eustachian valve can, on rare occasions, harbour pathology and can adversely impact the outcomes of coexisting medical problems such as deep venous thrombosis. Infective endocarditis, pulmonary embolism and systemic embolism via a patent foramen ovale are the major complications of eustachian valve pathology. Transesophageal echocardiography appears to be superior to transthoracic echocardiography in identifying eustachian valve pathology and should be considered in all patients with thromboembolism without a known source.


Strategies for managing fibromyalgia.

Laminin gamma2 fragments are increased in the circulation of patients with early phase acute lung injury. Laminin-5, a cell adhesive molecule expressed solely by epithelium, is known to enhance epithelial cell migration and repair of injured epithelium, after its essential component gamma2-chain is processed proteolytically. Our previous study revealed circulating levels of amino-terminal fragment of laminin gamma2-chain (G2F) reflect epithelial tumor invasiveness in carcinoma patients, but its physiological role in alveolar epithelial injury remains unknown. Sampling of epithelial lining fluids or pulmonary edema fluids from patients with acute lung injury (ALI) or related diseases was performed. Plasma samples were obtained from them at the time of disease onset or later. G2F concentrations were determined by immunoassay constructed by ourselves. We found a significantly higher amount of G2F in pulmonary edema and epithelial lining fluids of patients with ALI, as compared with those with the other respiratory diseases. Their plasma levels were also elevated significantly early at the onset of ALI (mean +/- SD; 147 +/- 82 ng/ml in non-surviving and 90 +/- 56 in surviving patients) as compared with those in the patients with cardiogenic pulmonary edema (59 +/- 36) or idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (37 +/- 17), indicating alveolar epithelium rapidly secrete laminin-5 in ALI. At 5 days after onset, non-surviving patients maintained higher plasma concentrations (152 +/- 84), but in contrast, the levels in surviving patients declined (71 +/- 35), suggesting secretion of laminin-5 was suppressed, associated with recovery from ALI. Circulating G2F may be a biomarker for alveolar laminin-5 secreted early at disease onset in ALI, potentially regulating alveolar re-epithelialization.

Impact of Maternal Exercise during Pregnancy on Offspring Chronic Disease Susceptibility. Maternal behaviors during pregnancy have been reported to impact offspring health in adulthood. In this article we explore the novel hypothesis that exercise during pregnancy can protect against chronic disease susceptibility in the offspring. To date, research has demonstrated that improvements in metabolic outcomes, cardiovascular risk, and cancer can occur in response to maternal exercise during pregnancy.

Assessment of quality control parameters for an X-ray tube using the Monte Carlo method and unfolding techniques. Quality Control (QC) parameters for an X-ray tube such as Half Value Layer (HVL), homogeneity factor and mean photon energy, can be obtained from the primary beam spectrum. A direct Monte Carlo (MC) simulation has been used to obtain this spectrum. Indirect spectrometry procedures such as Compton scattering have been also experimentally utilized since direct spectrometry causes a pile-up effect in detectors. As well the Compton spectrometry has been simulated with the MC method. In both cases unfolding techniques shall be applied to obtain the primary spectrum. Two unfolding methods (TSVD and Spectro-X) have been analyzed. Results are compared each other and with reference values taken from IPEM Report 78 catalogue. Direct MC simulation is a good approximation to obtain the primary spectrum and hence the QC parameters. TSVD is a better unfolding method for the scattered spectrum than the Spectro-X code. An improvement of the methodology to obtain QC parameters is important in Biomedical Engineering (BME) applications due to the wide use of X-ray tubes.

The E2FD/DEL2 factor is a component of a regulatory network controlling cell proliferation and development in Arabidopsis. An emerging view of plant cell cycle regulators, including the E2F transcription factors, implicates them in the integration of cell proliferation and development. Arabidopsis encodes six E2F proteins that can act as activators or repressors of E2F-responsive genes. E2FA, E2FB and E2FC interact with the retinoblastoma-like RBR protein and bind to DNA together with their DP partners. In contrast, E2FD, E2FE and E2FF (also known as DEL2, DEL1 and DEL3) are atypical E2Fs that possess duplicated DNA binding regions, lack trans-activating and RBR-binding domains and are believed to act as transcriptional inhibitors/repressors. E2FE/DEL1 has been shown to inhibit the endocycle and E2FF/DEL3 appears to control cell expansion but the role of E2FD/DEL2 has not been reported so far. In this study, we investigated the expression of E2FD/DEL2 and analysed the accumulation of its product. These studies revealed that E2FD/DEL2 accumulation is subject to negative post-translational regulation mediated by the plant hormone auxin. Moreover, the analysis of mutant and transgenic plants characterized by altered expression of E2FD/DEL2 has revealed that this atypical E2F can affect plant growth by promoting cell proliferation and repressing cell elongation. Overexpression of E2FD/DEL2 increased the expression of E2FA, E2FB and E2FE/DEL1 whereas its inactivation led to the up-regulation of genes encoding repressors of cell division. These results suggest that E2FD/DEL2 is part of a regulatory network that controls the balance between cell proliferation and development in Arabidopsis.

Ectodermal dysplasia-skin fragility syndrome. Pathogenic mutations have now been described in ten different desmosomal proteins: plakophilin 1 (PKP1) and 2 (PKP2); desmoplakin; plakoglobin; desmoglein 1, 2, and 4; desmocollin 2, and 3 corneodesmosin. Nevertheless, the first report of an inherited desmosomal gene disorder, published in 1997, involved loss-of-function mutations on both alleles of PKP1, the PKP1 gene. Loss of PKP1 expression in human skin leads to skin erosions and crusting, notably with perioral fissuring as well as palmoplantar hyperkeratosis with painful cracking of the skin. Other more variable features include abnormalities of ectodermal development with growth delay, hypotrichosis or alopecia, hypohidrosis, and nail dystrophy. In contrast to some other inherited disorders of desmosomes, there is no cardiac pathology in individuals with PKP1 mutations since it is not expressed in the heart. The collection of clinical features in individuals with PKP1 mutations has been termed ectodermal dysplasia-skin fragility (ED-SF) syndrome. This genodermatosis is classified as a suprabasal form of epidermolysis bullosa simplex and thus far there have been 10 published cases. Skin biopsy shows acanthosis, acantholysis, and a reduced number of small, poorly formed desmosomes. Loss of PKP1 expression results in an integral weakness within the desmosomal plaque, leading to desmosomal detachment and cell-cell separation. Thus, the clinicopathologic features attest to the significant role of PKP1 in stabilization of desmosome structure and function, predominantly in the spinous layers of the epidermis. This article reviews the clinical, structural, and molecular pathology of this genetic disorder of desmosomes.

MicroRNAs: New Biomarkers for Diagnosis, Prognosis, Therapy Prediction and Therapeutic Tools for Breast Cancer.

Quinoline-3-carboxamide containing sulfones as liver X receptor (LXR) agonists with binding selectivity for LXRbeta and low blood-brain penetration. A series of quinoline-3-carboxamide containing sulfones was prepared and found to have good binding affinity for LXRbeta and moderate binding selectivity over LXRalpha. The 8-Cl quinoline analog 33 with a high TPSA score, displayed 34-fold binding selectivity for LXRbeta over LXRalpha (LXRbeta IC(50)=16nM), good activity for inducing ABCA1 gene expression in a THP macrophage cell line, desired weak potency in the LXRalpha Gal4 functional assay, and low blood-brain barrier penetration in rat.

Crizotinib-induced cardiotoxicity: the importance of a proactive monitoring and management. Crizotinib is a multitarget tyrosine kinase inhibitor and it represents the standard of care in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase translocated non-small-cell lung cancer. Crizotinib is generally well tolerated and the most frequent adverse events include gastrointestinal effects, visual disorders, edema, fatigue and liver enzyme abnormalities. However, due to the increasing clinical experience with crizotinib, other toxicities are emerging, such as Q-wave T-wave interval prolongation and bradycardia. In the current review we will focus on the management of crizotinib-related cardiotoxicity.

Ear-pick injury as a traumatic ossicular damage in Japan. This retrospective study examined the etiology and treatment results for traumatic, conductive hearing loss in 22 patients who underwent surgery between 1998 and 2008 at Osaka Red Cross Hospital. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone preoperatively. The ear surgery comprised closure of the ruptured tympanic membranes and restoration of the sound-transmitting function of the ossicular chain. Their mean age was 30.3 years, and the average delay from injury until treatment was 6.0 years. Of the injuries due to foreign-body insertion, the most common cause was ear-pick injury. Incudostapedial disarticulation was the most common finding, which was diagnosed preoperatively using CT in seven cases and identified at surgery in 15 cases. Closure of the air-bone gap to within 10 and 20 dB was observed in 50.0 and 68.2% of the patients, respectively. The hearing threshold improved by 10 dB or more in 16 (72.7%) patients. If no improvement in hearing loss follows the absorption of hemotympanium or closure of an eardrum perforation, dislocation of the ossicular bones should be suspected. Ossicular reconstruction following trauma produces more stable and better hearing results, even after delayed treatment.


Long-lasting antinociceptive spinal effects in primates of the novel nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor agonist UFP-112.

Clustering of centralspindlin is essential for its accumulation to the central spindle and the midbody. Cytokinesis in animal cells requires the central spindle and midbody, which contain prominent microtubule bundles. Centralspindlin, a heterotetrameric complex consisting of kinesin-6 and RhoGAP (Rho-family GTPase-activating protein) subunits, is essential for the formation of these structures. Centralspindlin becomes precisely localized to the central spindle, where it promotes the equatorial recruitment of important cytokinetic regulators. These include ECT2, the activator of the small GTPase RhoA, which controls cleavage furrow formation and ingression. Centralspindlin's own RhoGAP domain also contributes to furrow ingression. Finally, centralspindlin facilitates recruitment of the chromosome passenger complex and factors that control abscission. Despite the importance of localized accumulation of centralspindlin, the mechanism by which this motor protein complex suddenly concentrates to the center of interpolar microtubule bundles during anaphase is unclear. Here, we show that centralspindlin travels along central spindle microtubules as higher-order clusters. Clustering of centralspindlin is critical for microtubule bundling and motility along microtubules in vitro and for midbody formation in vivo. These data support a positive feedback loop of centralspindlin clustering and microtubule organization that may underlie its distinctive localization during cytokinesis.

Structures of discoidal high density lipoproteins: a combined computational-experimental approach. Conversion of discoidal phospholipid (PL)-rich high density lipoprotein (HDL) to spheroidal cholesteryl ester-rich HDL is a central step in reverse cholesterol transport. A detailed understanding of this process and the atheroprotective role of apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) requires knowledge of the structure and dynamics of these various particles. This study, combining computation with experimentation, illuminates structural features of apoA-I allowing it to incorporate varying amounts of PL. Molecular dynamics simulated annealing of PL-rich HDL models containing unesterified cholesterol results in double belt structures with the same general saddle-shaped conformation of both our previous molecular dynamics simulations at 310 K and the x-ray structure of lipid-free apoA-I. Conversion from a discoidal to a saddle-shaped particle involves loss of helicity and formation of loops in opposing antiparallel parts of the double belt. During surface expansion caused by the temperature-jump step, the curved palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayer surfaces approach planarity. Relaxation back into saddle-shaped structures after cool down and equilibration further supports the saddle-shaped particle model. Our kinetic analyses of reconstituted particles demonstrate that PL-rich particles exist in discrete sizes corresponding to local energetic minima. Agreement of experimental and computational determinations of particle size/shape and apoA-I helicity provide additional support for the saddle-shaped particle model. Truncation experiments combined with simulations suggest that the N-terminal proline-rich domain of apoA-I influences the stability of PL-rich HDL particles. We propose that apoA-I incorporates increasing PL in the form of minimal surface bilayers through the incremental unwinding of an initially twisted saddle-shaped apoA-I double belt structure.

Endovascular management of the popliteal artery: comparison of atherectomy and angioplasty. Symptomatic atherosclerotic disease of the popliteal artery presents challenges for endovascular therapy. We evaluated the technical success, complications, and midterm outcomes of atherectomy and angioplasty involving the popliteal segment. We conducted a retrospective review of outcomes of popliteal artery intervention using atherectomy or angioplasty performed between 2003 and 2008. A total of 56 patients (36% women, age 72.8 +/- 12.2 years, 77% critical limb ischemia) underwent popliteal atherectomy (n = 18) or angioplasty (n = 38). These patients had similar clinical characteristics, TransAtlantic Intersociety Consensus (TASC)/ TASC II classification, mean lesion length, and runoff scores. We observed a trend toward higher rates of technical success defined as <30% residual stenosis after atherectomy compared to angioplasty (94% vs 71%, P = .08). While angioplasty was associated with a higher frequency of arterial dissection (23% vs 0%, P = .003), atherectomy was associated with a higher rate of thromboembolic events (22% vs 0%, P = 0.01). Adjunctive stenting was used more frequently following angioplasty compared to atherectomy (45% vs 6%, P = .005). Thrombolysis was used to treat embolization in 4 patients in the atherectomy group. The improvement in the ankle-brachial index (ABI) was similar between the 2 treatment groups. Primary patency of the popliteal artery at 3, 6, and 12 months was 94%, 88%, and 75% in the atherectomy group and 89%, 82%, and 73% in the angioplasty group (P = not significant [NS]). There were no significant differences in limb salvage and freedom from reintervention at 1 year between the atherectomy and angioplasty groups. Our experience with popliteal artery endovascular therapy indicates a distinct pattern of procedural complications with atherectomy compared to angioplasty but similar midterm patency, limb salvage, and freedom from intervention.


Persicarin from water dropwort (Oenanthe javanica) protects primary cultured rat cortical cells from glutamate-induced neurotoxicity.

Separation of polyphenols and caffeine from the acetone extract of fermented tea leaves (Camellia sinensis) using high-performance countercurrent chromatography. Leaves from Camellia sienensis are a popular natural source of various beverage worldwide, and contain caffeine and polyphenols derived from catechin analogues. In the current study, caffeine (CAF, 1) and three tea polyphenols including (-)-epigallocatechin 3-O-gallate (EGCg, 2), (-)-gallocatechin 3-O-gallate (GCg, 3), and (-)-epicatechin 3-O-gallate (ECg, 4) were isolated and purified by flow-rate gradient high-performance countercurrent chromatography (HPCCC) using a two-phase solvent system composed of n-hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (1:9:1:9, v/v). Two hundred milligrams of acetone-soluble extract from fermented C. sinensis leaves was separated by HPCCC to give 1 (25.4 mg), 2 (16.3 mg), 3 (11.1 mg) and 4 (4.4 mg) with purities over 98%. The structures of 1-4 were elucidated by QTOF-MS, as well as 1H- and 13C-NMR, and the obtained data were compared to the previously reported values. 


Generation of recombinant nucleocapsid protein of human metapneumovirus in baculovirus for detecting antibodies in the Beijing population.

siah-1 Protein is necessary for high glucose-induced glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase nuclear accumulation and cell death in Muller cells. The translocation and accumulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in the nucleus has closely been associated with cell death induction. However, the mechanism of this process has not been completely understood. The E3 ubiquitin ligase siah-1 (seven in absentia homolog 1) has recently been identified as a potential shuttle protein to transport GAPDH from the cytosol to the nucleus. Previously, we have demonstrated that elevated glucose levels induce GAPDH nuclear accumulation in retinal MÃ¼ller cells. Therefore, this study investigated the role of siah-1 in high glucose-induced GAPDH nuclear translocation and subsequent cell death in retinal MÃ¼ller cells. High glucose significantly increased siah-1 expression within 12 h. Under hyperglycemic conditions, siah-1 formed a complex with GAPDH and was predominantly localized in the nucleus of MÃ¼ller cells. siah-1 knockdown using 50 nm siah-1 small interfering RNA significantly decreased high glucose-induced GAPDH nuclear accumulation at 24 h by 43.8 +/- 4.0%. Further, knockdown of siah-1 prevented high glucose-induced cell death of MÃ¼ller cells potentially by inhibiting p53 phosphorylation consistent with previous observations, indicating that nuclear GAPDH induces cell death via p53 activation. Therefore, inhibition of GAPDH nuclear translocation and accumulation by targeting siah-1 promotes MÃ¼ller cell survival under hyperglycemic conditions.

[Isolation of Candida spp. from ascites in cirrhotic patients]. The isolation of Candida spp. in ascites of cirrhotic patients is an uncommon situation in clinical practice. Factors that have been associated with increased susceptibility to primary fungal peritonitis are exposure to broad-spectrum antibiotics and immunosuppression, a typical situation of these patients. We report seven episodes of Candida spp. isolation in ascites of cirrhotic patients detected in our hospital during the past 15years. 

Tension and motion measurement for extended trochanteric osteotomy with different fixation methods. The revision of total hip arthroplasty (THA) is becoming an increasingly common procedure around the world. The extended trochanteric osteotomy (ETO) has proved to be an effective way in revision of THA. Four generations of trochanteric osteotomy fixation systems have been developed, all of which has its own clinical application. However, few studies on the biomechanical stability of the above fixation methods have been reported, though many clinical follow-up studies showed some postoperative functional differences among them. Research in this field is mainly subject to constraints of measurement devices and 3D motion analysis. We designed a synchronous testing approach to acquire the tension data loaded to the greater trochanter and minimal rotation or migration of osteotomy fragment which could not be solved by strain gauge method. Active markers were designed to precisely track proximal femoral bed and the osteotomy fragment in 3D space. Six cadaver femurs constructed as vitro biomechanical models were chosen for a preliminary study. Each femur underwent the steps of prosthesis implanting, ETO and a series of five fixation methods in a random order with 2 wires, 3 wires, 2 wires and a short claw plate,2 cables and a short claw plate, and a long claw plate. We also gave a preliminary result of the displacement of fragment and the stiffness of femur after ETO in this paper. Further clinical significance remains to be discussed.

B-mode ultrasonographic evaluation of the testis in relation to serum testosterone concentration in male Yangtze finless porpoise (Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis) during the breeding season. The use of ultrasonography as a noninvasive tool for assessing the reproductive status of the male Yangtze finless porpoise (YFP; Neophocaena phocaenoides asiaeorientalis) was validated by correlating ultrasonographically determined testicular volume (TV) and testicular parenchyma pixel intensity (PI) with serum testosterone (T) concentration. The testes of 13 free-ranging male YFPs from the Tian-e-Zhou Reserve and three captive animals from the Baiji Dolphinarium (Wuhan, China) were examined ultrasonographically during April 2008. Testis volume was determined using Lambert's formula for an ellipsoid. Testicular parenchyma PI was evaluated by analyzing testicular ultrasonograms using pixel analysis software (Image J). Serum T concentrations were determined using a single-antibody radioimmunoassay. The TV, PI, and serum T concentration were low and similar in animals with body length <133 cm, highest in those with body length >or=142 cm, and highly variable in those with body length from 133 to 141 cm. Both TV and PI were closely correlated with serum T concentration (r=0.91 and r=0.85, respectively; P<0.01), indicating a consistent association between structural and functional development of the testis. In conclusion, we inferred that puberty onset in male YFPs occurred when TV was >150 cm(3) and PI was >60 during the breeding season and that testicular ultrasonography and pixel analysis was an efficient, noninvasive, real-time tool to evaluate testicular function of live male YFPs.

Microbial associations in gut systems of wood- and bark-inhabiting longhorned beetles [Coleoptera: Cerambycidae]. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques and PCR-based rDNA sequencing, gut microflora in the larvae of bark- and wood-inhabiting cerambycid beetles (Rhagium inquisitor, Tetropium castaneum, Plagionotus arcuatus and Leptura rubra [Coleoptera: Cerambycidae]) was investigated. A total of 12 novel ascomycetous yeast strains were isolated from the gut content. Panfungal and strain-specific oligonucleotide probes identified two yeast strains as Candida rhagii and Candida shehatae, which were colonizing specialized organs (mycetomes) adhering to the gut of R. inquisitor and L. rubra larvae, respectively. Fragments containing these organisms were constantly being released from the mycetomes into the gut lumen. Whereas the mycetome symbiont of T. castaneum could not be identified, all larvae of this species harbored an additional bacterial endocytobiont in their gut epithelium. This novel gammaproteobacterium belonged to the Sodalis clade of insect symbionts, which includes the secondary endosymbiont of tsetse flies (Sodalis glossinidius) and the Sitophilus oryzae primary endosymbiont (SOPE). Extracellular gut flora of the investigated cerambycid larvae was comprised of Alpha-, Beta-, and Gammaproteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia and Acidobacteria. However, the individual composition among investigated larvae was highly variable and supposedly depended on individual host nutrition.

Importance of Large Intestine in Regulating Bile Acids and Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 in Germ-Free Mice. It is known that 1) elevated serum bile acids (BAs) are associated with decreased body weight, 2) elevated glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels can decrease body weight, and 3) germ-free (GF) mice are resistant to diet-induced obesity. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that a lack of intestinal microbiota results in more BAs in the body, resulting in increased BA-mediated transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) signaling and increased serum GLP-1 as a mechanism of resistance of GF mice to diet-induced obesity. GF mice had 2- to 4-fold increased total BAs in the serum, liver, bile, and ileum. Fecal excretion of BAs was 63% less in GF mice. GF mice had decreased secondary BAs and increased taurine-conjugated BAs, as anticipated. Surprisingly, there was an increase in non-12Î±-OH BAs, namely, Î²-muricholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and their taurine conjugates, in GF mice. Further, in vitro experiments confirmed that UDCA is a primary BA in mice. There were minimal changes in the mRNA of farnesoid X receptor target genes in the ileum (Fibroblast growth factor 15, small heterodimer protein, and ileal bile acid-binding protein), in the liver (small heterodimer protein, liver receptor homolog-1, and cytochrome P450 7a1), and BA transporters (apical sodium dependent bile acid transporter, organic solute transporter Î±, and organic solute transporter Î²) in the ileum of GF mice. Surprisingly, there were marked increases in BA transporters in the large intestine. Increased GLP-1 levels and gallbladder size were observed in GF mice, suggesting activation of TGR5 signaling. In summary, the GF condition results in increased expression of BA transporters in the colon, resulting in 1) an increase in total BA concentrations in tissues, 2) a change in BA composition to favor an increase in non-12Î±-OH BAs, and 3) activation of TGR5 signaling with increased gallbladder size and GLP-1.

Catalytic mechanism of human alpha-galactosidase. The enzyme alpha-galactosidase (alpha-GAL, also known as alpha-GAL A; E.C. 3.2.1.22) is responsible for the breakdown of alpha-galactosides in the lysosome. Defects in human alpha-GAL lead to the development of Fabry disease, a lysosomal storage disorder characterized by the buildup of alpha-galactosylated substrates in the tissues. alpha-GAL is an active target of clinical research: there are currently two treatment options for Fabry disease, recombinant enzyme replacement therapy (approved in the United States in 2003) and pharmacological chaperone therapy (currently in clinical trials). Previously, we have reported the structure of human alpha-GAL, which revealed the overall structure of the enzyme and established the locations of hundreds of mutations that lead to the development of Fabry disease. Here, we describe the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme derived from x-ray crystal structures of each of the four stages of the double displacement reaction mechanism. Use of a difluoro-alpha-galactopyranoside allowed trapping of a covalent intermediate. The ensemble of structures reveals distortion of the ligand into a (1)S(3) skew (or twist) boat conformation in the middle of the reaction cycle. The high resolution structures of each step in the catalytic cycle will allow for improved drug design efforts on alpha-GAL and other glycoside hydrolase family 27 enzymes by developing ligands that specifically target different states of the catalytic cycle. Additionally, the structures revealed a second ligand-binding site suitable for targeting by novel pharmacological chaperones.

A comparison of the in vitro biotransformation of (-)-epicatechin and procyanidin B2 by human faecal microbiota. The catabolism by human faecal microbiota of (-)-epicatechin (1) (2, 3-cis stereochemistry) and its dimer pure procyanidin B2 (2), has been compared using a static in vitro culture model. The catabolites were characterised by LC-MS(n), UV absorption and relative retention time, and quantified relative to standards. No more than approximately 10% of procyanidin B2 (2) was converted to epicatechin (1) by scission of the interflavan bond. Five phenolic acid catabolites (M(r)<290) were unique to 2, and ten phenolic acid catabolites (M(r)<290) were common to both substrates. The dominant catabolites (> or =24 h incubation) were 5-(3'-hydroxy phenyl) valeric acid (9), 3-(3'-hydroxyphenyl) propionic acid (10) and phenyl acetic acid (12) (maximum yields 27.4+/-4.2, 38.2+/-4.2, 22.7+/-2.9%, respectively, from 1 and 9.4+/-1.2, 52.8+/-2.1, 28.8+/-1.6%, respectively, from 2). Substrate 2 was degraded twice as rapidly as 1. Evidence is presented for the production of previously unreported catabolites of 2 that retain the flavanol A-ring and the C4-->C8 interflavan bond. It was confirmed that catabolism favoured removal of the 4'-hydroxyl rather than the 3'-hydroxyl group and that both beta-oxidation and alpha-oxidation occurred.

Development of a fuzzy-stochastic nonlinear model to incorporate aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Site uncertainties significantly influence groundwater flow and contaminant transport predictions. Aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty are both identified in site characterization and represented using proper uncertainty theories. When one theory best represents one parameter whereas a different theory may be more suitable for another parameter, the hybrid propagation of aleatoric (random) and epistemic (nonrandom) uncertainties will occur. The computational challenges of joint propagation of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty through groundwater flow and contaminant transport models are significant. A fuzzy-stochastic nonlinear model was developed in this paper to incorporate these two types of uncertain site information and reduce the computational cost. The results show that (1) the computational cost using the nonlinear model is reduced compared with that of using the sparse grid algorithm and Monte Carlo methods; (2) the uncertainty of hydraulic conductivity (K) significantly influences the water head and solute distribution at the observation wells compared to other uncertain parameters, such as the storage coefficient and the distribution coefficient (K(d)); and (3) the combination of multiple uncertain parameters substantially affects the simulation results. Neglecting site uncertainties may lead to unrealistic predictions.


Mycobacterium smegmatis expressing a chimeric protein MPT64-proteolipid protein (PLP) 139-151 reorganizes the PLP-specific T cell repertoire favoring a CD8-mediated response and induces a relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.

Response acquisition by humans with delayed reinforcement. The present experiment examined whether a response class was acquired by humans with delayed reinforcement. Eight white circles were presented on a computer touch screen. If the undergraduates touched two of the eight circles in a specified sequence (i.e., touching first the upper-left circle then the bottom-left circle), then the touches initiated an unsignaled resetting delay culminating in point delivery. Participants experienced one of three different delays (0 s, 10 s, or 30 s). Rates of the target two-response sequence were higher with delayed reinforcement than with no reinforcement. Terminal rates of the target sequence decreased and postreinforcement pauses increased as a function of delay duration. Other undergraduates exposed to yoked schedules of response-independent point deliveries failed to acquire the sequence. The results demonstrate that a response class was acquired with delayed reinforcement, extending the generality of this phenomenon found with nonhuman animals to humans.

Adolescent obesity in Syria: prevalence and associated factors. Abstract Background Data on the prevalence of overweight and obesity in Eastern Mediterranean countries remain scarce, particularly for children and adolescents. The objective of this study is to estimate the prevalence of obesity and examine associated factors and covariates amongst school adolescents in Syria. Methods A cross-sectional survey of a representative sample of 776 adolescents (386 males and 390 females), aged 15-18 years, was conducted in six randomly chosen secondary schools in Damascus, the capital city of Syria. Anthropometric measurements and dietary assessment data were collected using standard methods and techniques. Overweight and obesity were defined according to World Health Organization 2007 child growth standards. Results The prevalence rates of overweight and obesity were estimated at 18.9 and 8.6%, respectively. Carbohydrate and saturated fatty acid intakes were significantly higher amongst overweight and obese (250.66 and 32.82 g/day, respectively) as compared with normal weight adolescents (218.12 and 26.10 g/day, respectively). Regression analysis showed that the likelihood of obesity was significantly greater amongst adolescent boys than girls (OR = 2.30, P < 0.05) and amongst subjects reporting family history of obesity (OR = 2.98, P < 0.05). The odds of obesity increased consistently with increasing educational attainment of both parents and was higher (OR = 1.63) amongst adolescents reporting lower crowding index than their counterparts. Conclusion Our findings of a positive association between obesity and socio-economic status measured by parental education and crowding index call for intervention strategies for the promotion of healthy dietary practices not only amongst school adolescents but also parents, targeting families as the unit of intervention. Further studies are needed to examine nutritional habits and food choices amongst families of different socio-economic strata.


Preliminary 6 month results from the Argus II epiretinal prosthesis feasibility study.

Evaluation of long-term visual performance following AcrySof ReSTOR lens implantation. Multifocal lens has become popular in cataract surgery. Short-term outcome after AcrySof ReSTOR Lens implantation had been reported by many studies, but long-term visual performance and the effect of posterior capsular opacification (PCO) on visual performance need further investigation. This retrospective study involved 54 eyes from 41 cataract patients implanted with ReSTOR lens, with a follow-up period of 12 to 31 months. Manifest refraction spherical equivalence (MRSE), monocular uncorrected and best-corrected distance visual acuity, uncorrected and distance-corrected near and intermediate visual acuity, contrast sensitivity were assessed. The effect of PCO on visual performance was evaluated by comparing visual parameters between pre and post-capsulotomy. Uncorrected distance visual acuity of eyes with MRSE within +/-0.5 diopter (D) was better than those with MRSE greater than +/-0.5 D (P < 0.05). Uncorrected distance and near visual acuity (LogMAR) was 0.10 and 0.17 respectively. Best corrected distance visual acuity and best distance-corrected near visual acuity (LogMAR) was 0.00 and 0.16, a significant improvement was noted after correction (P = 0.000, P = 0.001, respectively). Contrast sensitivity logarithm was comparable with the normal value at difference spatial frequencies except at 12 cpd. In 5 eyes with mild PCO, post-capsulotomy visual parameters were better than pre-capsulotomy (P < 0.05). ReSTOR lens provides a good long-term distance and near vision, functional intermediate vision and contrast sensitivity. Mild PCO significantly affects visual performance and needs early intervention.

Utility of baseline impedance level measurement in patients with gastroesophageal reflux symptoms. Twenty-four-hour multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) and pH monitoring is used for detecting reflux episodes in patients with gastroesophageal reflux (GER) disease. However, the clinical significance of baseline impedance levels (BILs) has not been well studied. We aimed to evaluate whether BILs are related to various reflux events or acid-related parameters and to determine whether BILs during specific intervals could be substituted for 24-h BILs. One-hundred forty-two patients GER symptoms underwent 24-h pH/impedance monitoring. We measured pH [(5 cm above the low esophageal sphincter (LES)] and BILs from three sites (3, 5, and 15 cm above the LES). Eighty-one subjects (57.0%) were diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease, and 53 (37.3%) had acid reflux and 28 (19.7%) had nonacid reflux. The 24-h BILs at distal sites were lower in the "reflux" group than in the "no reflux" group (p < 0.001) and lower in the "acid reflux" group than in the "nonacid reflux" group (p < 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in 24-h BILs at the proximal site among the "no reflux", "acid reflux", and "nonacid reflux" groups. The interclass correlation coefficient value of 24-h BILs with daytime 6-h BILs was 0.916 (95% CI 0.882-0.940) and that with nighttime 6-h BILs was 0.909 (95% CI 0.871-0.935). BILs are related to GER, especially acid reflux. Location and duration of assessment for BILs needs to be standardized. Six-hour BILs could be substitutes for 24-h BILs. During analysis of MII-pH, more attention should be paid to BILs in the lower esophagus.

Volumetric injury of the physis during single-bundle anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in children: a 3-dimensional study using magnetic resonance imaging. To determine the volume of injury to the physis during anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction in pediatric patients. Magnetic resonance imaging scans of 10 pediatric knees were converted into 3-dimensional models. Computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacturing software placed drill holes (6, 7, 8, and 9 mm in diameter) in these models, simulating tunnels used for ACL reconstruction. The software was used to calculate total physeal volume and volume of physis removed by the tunnel. The ratio of physeal volume removed to the total physeal volume was determined. For 6-, 7-, 8-, and 9-mm-diameter drill holes, the mean percent of physeal volume removed/total physeal volume was 1.6%, 2.2%, 2.9%, and 3.8%, respectively, for the tibia and 2.4%, 3.2%, 4.2%, and 5.4%, respectively, for the femur. For all subjects, the volume removed was less than 7.0% for the tibia and 9.0% for the femur by use of drill holes from 6 to 9 mm. The tibial drill hole was centrally placed in all cases compared with a more peripheral drill hole placement of the femur. Drill hole placement during ACL reconstruction produces a zone of physeal injury. The overall volume of injury is relatively low, which reduces the risk of physeal arrest. With careful drill hole placement, the region of injury is central on the tibia, and the total volume of injury can be less than 5.0% of the physeal volume. For the femur, the total volume can be less than 5.0% as well. However, the region of injury is peripheral, which carries a higher risk of physeal arrest. A better understanding of the relation between the ACL and physis may guide the placement of drill holes, which have a lower risk of producing physeal arrest.


Early identification of shock in critically ill patients.

Novel MEMS stiffness sensor for in-vivo tissue characterization measurement. This paper presents the design, mathematical model, fabrication and testing of a novel type of in-vivo stiffness sensor. The proposed sensor can measure both tissue stiffness and contact force. The sensing concept utilizes multiple membranes with varying stiffness and is particularly designed for integration with minimally invasive surgical (MIS) tools. In order to validate the new sensing concept, MEMS capacitive sensors are fabricated using surface micromachining with each fabricated sensor having a 1mm x 1mm active sensor area. Finally, the sensors are tested by touching polymers of different elastic stiffnesses. The results are promising and confirm the capability of the sensor for measuring both force and tissue compliance.

Particular features of systolic and diastolic functions in patients with metabolic syndrome.

Metabolic profiling of ultrasmall sample volumes with GC/MS: from microliter to nanoliter samples. Profiling of metabolites is increasingly used to study the functioning of biological systems. For some studies the volume of available samples is limited to only a few microliters or even less, for fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of small animals like mice or the analysis of individual oocytes. Here we present an analytical method using in-liner silylation coupled to gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS), that is suitable for metabolic profiling in ultrasmall sample volumes of 2 microL down to 10 nL. Method performance was assessed in various biosamples. Derivatization efficiencies for sugars, organic acids, and amino acids were satisfactory (105-120%), and repeatabilities were generally better than 15%, except for amino acids that had repeatabilities up to about 35-40%. For endogenous sugars and organic acids in fetal bovine serum, the response was linear for aliquots from 10 nL up to at least 1 microL. The developed GC/MS method was applied for the analysis of different sample matrixes, i.e., fetal bovine serum, mouse CSF, and aliquots of the intracellular content of Xenopus laevis oocytes. To the best of our knowledge, we present here the first comprehensive GC/MS metabolite profiles from mouse CSF and from the intracellular content of a single X. laevis oocyte.

Patterns of cortical thickness according to APOE genotype in Alzheimer's disease. Possession of one or more apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 alleles may influence the distribution of atrophy and clinical phenotype. We aimed to assess the influence of APOE genotype on cortical thickness and regional brain volumes in AD (Alzheimer's disease). We included 38 patients (9 epsilon4 non-carriers, 23 epsilon4 heterozygotes, 6 epsilon4 homozygotes) and 23 controls. Each subject had 2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and a neuropsychological battery. Cortical thickness and isthmus cingulate volume were measured using FreeSurfer; the volumes of the hippocampus, whole brain, and lateral ventricles were calculated using manual and semi-automated volumetry. Compared with controls, cortical thickness was significantly lower: in the bilateral temporal, posterior parietal and occipital regions in non-carriers, in the medial temporal and left parietal regions in heterozygotes, and in the medial temporal lobe in homozygotes. Comparisons between AD subgroups did not show significant differences. A trend for larger brain and isthmus cingulate volumes and smaller hippocampal and ventricular volumes with increasing epsilon4 dose were seen. These differences were supported by neuropsychological profiles. These results suggest that APOE genotype may influence the topography of regional atrophy and cortical thinning in AD.

Using a replica of Leeuwenhoek's microscope to teach the history of science and to motivate students to discover the vision and the contributions of the first microscopists. The history of science should be incorporated into science teaching as a means of improving learning and also to increase the students' understanding about the nature of science. In biology education, the history of microscopy deserves a special place. The discovery of this instrument not only opened a new and fantastic microworld but also led to the development of one unifying principle of biological sciences (i.e., cell theory). The microscopes of Leeuwenhoek and Hooke opened windows into the microworld of living organisms. In the present work, the knowledge of these themes was analyzed in a group of students beginning an undergraduate biology course. Our data suggest that the history of microscopy is poorly treated at the secondary school level. We propose a didactic activity using a replica of Leeuwenhoek's microscope made with Plexiglas and a lens obtained from a key chain laser pointer or from a broken CD drive. The proposed activity motivated students to learn about microscopy and helped them to appreciate scientific knowledge from a historical perspective.

[Prevention of postpartal endometritis: antibiotic of choice]. In spite of the advances of modern medicine, puerperal infection is still one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality of women in postpartal period. The aim of this study was to analyse the presence of microorganisms in the cervicovaginal region of women in labour, as well as the frequency of puerperal endometritis in order to determine optimal treatment for isolated microorganisms and to prevent postpartal endometritis. In this study, all women who gave birth to a healthy child per vias naturalis during the past two years in a tertiary health institution, Institute of Gynaecology and Obstetrics, Clinical Centre of Serbia, were analysed. The investigation involved 6,391 women in labour. Cervicovaginal smear was taken from all patients before labour, on admission for delivery, and sent to microbiological analysis. Standard procedures of bacterial cultivation were used. For statistical analysis of the results, we used the statistical programme SPSS 15. A single microorganism was isolated from each smear of 612 women and in 52 patients two microorganisms were registered in the same smear. We identified 10 sorts of microorganisms, out of which Escherichia coli (in 43.8% of cases), and Enterococcus spp. (in 27.9% of cases) were the most frequent ones. Due to the appropriate approach, there were no cases of puerperal endometritis registered. Reactivity tests showed that Escherichia coli was sensitive to trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole, Enterococcus spp. to macrolides and cephalosporines, while both types of microorganisms were sensitive to synthetic penicillins and fluoroquinolines. The study results show that 10.9% of pregnant women have positive findings of the cervicovaginal smear and that infection prevention should be directed towards Escherichia coli and Enterococcus spp. by administration of the listed antibiotics.


[Streptomyces globisporus 1912 mutants highly sensitive to ultraviolet radiation, their antibiotic activity and reparation ability].

Lineage and host source are both correlated with levels of Shiga toxin 2 production by Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains. Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains fall into three major genetic lineages that differ in their distribution among humans and cattle. Several recent studies have reported differences in the expression of virulence factors between E. coli O157:H7 strains from these two host species. In this study, we wished to determine if important virulence-associated "mobile genetic elements" such as Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2)-encoding prophage are lineage restricted or are host source related and acquired independently of the pathogen genotype. DNA sequencing of the stx(2) flanking region from a lineage II (LII) strain, EC970520, revealed that the transcriptional activator gene Q in LI strain EDL933 (upstream of stx(2)) is replaced by a pphA (serine/threonine phosphatase) homologue and an altered Q gene in this and all other LII strains tested. In addition, nearly all LI strains carried stx(2), whereas all LII strains carried variant stx(2c) and 4 of 14 LI/II strains had copies of both stx(2) and variant stx(2c). Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) demonstrated that LI and LI/II strains produce significantly more stx(2) mRNA and Stx2 than LII strains. However, among LI strains significantly more Stx2 is also produced by strains from humans than from cattle. Therefore, lineage-associated differences among E. coli O157:H7 strains such as prophage content, toxin type, and toxin expression may contribute to host isolation bias. However, the level of Stx2 production alone may also play an important role in the within-lineage association of E. coli O157:H7 strains with human clinical disease.

Alpharadin, a 223Ra-based alpha-particle-emitting pharmaceutical for the treatment of bone metastases in patients with cancer. Bone metastases occur in many patients with different forms of solid malignant tumors, particularly in advanced stages of prostate and breast cancer, and are commonly associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The resulting bone pain interferes with quality of life and thus requires effective treatment. However, various non-radiotherapeutic modalities such as analgesics, hormone therapy, orchidectomy, cytostatic and cytotoxic drugs, bisphosphonates and surgery are not universally effective. External-beam radiotherapy is suitable only for well-defined localized bone metastases, and extended field radiation is often accompanied by serious side effects. Therefore, systemic radionuclide therapy must be considered as a valuable and effective method of treatment in patients with widespread skeletal metastases. The alpha-emitter 223Ra-based Alpharadin is a new radiopharmaceutical under development by Algeta ASA in collaboration with Bayer Schering Pharma AG. Early clinical data demonstrated a significant decrease in bone-alkaline phosphatase levels following therapy with Alpharadin compared with placebo. Median time to PSA progression, median survival and pain relief were also superior to placebo, and no dose-limiting hematological toxicity was observed. A phase III trial for Alpharadin was ongoing at the time of publication.

Amiodarone and thyroid. Assessment of TSH and TPO-Ab before starting amiodarone (AM) treatment is recommended. The usefulness of periodic TSH measurement every 6 months during AM treatment is limited by the often sudden explosive onset of AIT, and the spontaneous return of a suppressed TSH to normal values in half of the cases. AM-induced hypothyroidism develops rather early after starting treatment, preferentially in iodine-sufficient areas and in females with TPO-Ab; it is due to failure to escape from the Wolff-Chaikoff effect, resulting in preserved radioiodine uptake. AM-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) occurs at any time during treatment, preferentially in iodine-deficient regions and in males. AIT can be classified in type 1 (iodide-induced thyrotoxicosis, best treated by potassium perchlorate in combination with thionamides and discontinuation of AM) and type 2 (destructive thyrotoxicosis, best treated by prednisone; discontinuation of AM may not be necessary). AIT is associated with a higher rate of major adverse cardiovascular events (especially of ventricular arrhythmias). Uncertainty continues to exist with respect to the feasibility of continuation of AM despite AIT, the appropriate methods to distinguish between AIT type 1 and 2 as well as the advantages of AIT classification into subtypes in view of possible mixed cases, and the best policy when AM needs to be restarted.


Study of stress distribution and displacement of the maxillary complex following application of forces using jackscrew and nitanium palatal expander 2--a finite element study.

Estimation of central aortic forces in the ballistocardiogram under rest and exercise conditions. The ballistocardiogram (BCG) signal represents the movements of the body in response to cardiac ejection of blood. The BCG signal can change considerably under various physiological states; however, little information exists in literature describing how these forces are generated. A physical analysis is presented using a finite element model of thoracic aortic vasculature to quantify forces generated by the blood flow during the cardiac cycle. The traction at the fluid-solid interface of this deformable wall model generates a Central Aortic Force (CAF) which appears of similar magnitude to recorded BCG forces. The increased pulse pressure in an exercise simulation caused a significant increase in CAF, which is consistent with recent BCG measurements in exercise recovery.

Antilithiatic Activity of phlorotannin rich extract of Sarghassum Wightii on Calcium Oxalate Urolithiais - InVitro and In Vivo Evaluation. Urolithiasis is a common urological disorder responsible for serious human affliction and cost to the society with a high recurrence rate. The aim of the present study was to systematically evaluate the phlorotannin rich extract of Sargassum wightii using suitable in vitro and in vivo models to provide scientific evidence for its antilithiatic activity. To explore the effect of Sargassum wightii on calcium oxalate crystallization, in vitro assays like crystal nucleation, aggregation and crystal growth were performed. Calcium oxalate urolithiasis was induced in male Sprague dawley rats using a combination of gentamicin and calculi producing diet (5% ammonium oxalate and rat pellet feed). The biochemical parameters like calcium, oxalate, magnesium, phosphate, sodium and potassium were evaluated in urine, serum and kidney homogenates. Histopathological studies were also done to confirm the biochemical findings. The yield of Sargassum wightii extract was found to be 74.5 gm/kg and confirmed by quantitative analysis. In vitro experiments with Sargassum wightii showed concentration dependent inhibition of calcium oxalate nucleation, aggregation and growth supported by SEM analysis. In the in vivo model, Sargassum wightii reduced both calcium and oxalate supersaturation in urine, serum and deposition in the kidney. The biochemical results were supported by histopathological studies. The findings of the present study suggest that Sargassum wightii has the ability to prevent nucleation, aggregation and growth of calcium oxalate crystals. Sargassum wightii has better preventive effect on calcium oxalate stone formation indicating its strong potential to develop as a therapeutic option to prevent recurrence of urolithiasis.

Evaluating the Long-Term Health and Economic Impacts of Central Residential Air Filtration for Reducing Premature Mortality Associated with Indoor Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5) of Outdoor Origin. Much of human exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) of outdoor origin occurs in residences. High-efficiency particle air filtration in central heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems is increasingly being used to reduce concentrations of particulate matter inside homes. However, questions remain about the effectiveness of filtration for reducing exposures to PM2.5 of outdoor origin and adverse health outcomes. Here we integrate epidemiology functions and mass balance modeling to estimate the long-term health and economic impacts of HVAC filtration for reducing premature mortality associated with indoor PM2.5 of outdoor origin in residences. We evaluate 11 classifications of filters (MERV 5 through HEPA) using six case studies of single-family home vintages and ventilation system combinations located in 22 U.S. cities. We estimate that widespread use of higher efficiency filters would reduce premature mortality by 0.002-2.5% and increase life expectancy by 0.02-1.6 months, yielding annual monetary benefits ranging from $1 to $1348 per person in the homes and locations modeled herein. Large differences in the magnitude of health and economic impacts are driven largely by differences in rated filter efficiency and building and ventilation system characteristics that govern particle infiltration and persistence, with smaller influences attributable to geographic location. 

Prevalence and diversity of avian malaria parasites in migratory Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger, Laridae, Charadriiformes) from the Brazilian Amazon Basin. The Medium SolimÃµes River region in the Brazilian Amazon Basin is an area utilized for reproduction and nesting by a variety of species of migratory aquatic birds such as Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger). These migratory birds form mixed-species reproductive colonies with high population densities and exhibit a large range of migration routes. This study aimed to describe the prevalence and diversity of the avian malaria parasites Plasmodium and Haemoproteus in Black Skimmers, on the basis of the association between microscopic observation of blood smears and amplification of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene (mtDNA cyt-b). The overall prevalence rates of the parasites for juvenile and adult bird specimens were 16% (5/31) and 22% (15/68), respectively. Sequencing the mtDNA cyt-b marker revealed two Plasmodium lineages, which had been previously described in different regions of the American continent, including a Neotropical region in Southeast Brazil, and one Haemoproteus lineage. The fact that avian malarial parasites have been found infecting the Black Skimmers in the Brazilian Amazon ecosystem, which exhibits considerable diversity, highlights the importance of these migratory birds as a potential source of infection and dispersion of pathogens to other susceptible birds of the Nearctic and Neotropical regions.

Quantitative, dynamic 18F-FDG-PET for the evaluation of soft tissue sarcomas: relation to differential diagnosis, tumor grading and prediction of prognosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate soft tissue sarcomas by dynamic (18)F-FDG-PET studies, and to establish an index of kinetic parameters for evaluation of their malignancy, histological grade and prognosis, after surgical resection. One hundred and seventeen patients including 79 with histologically proven soft tissue malignancies, 14 with primary benign soft tissue tumors and 24 with postoperative scar tissues were examined. The (18)F-FDG studies were accomplished as a dynamic series for 60 min. The evaluation of the (18)F-FDG kinetics was performed using the following parameters: standardized uptake value (SUV), global influx (Ki), computation of transport constants (k1-k4) with consideration of the vascular fraction (VB) according to a two tissue compartment model, and fractal dimension (FD) based on the box-counting procedure (non-compartmental model). Discriminant analysis (DA) was used for data evaluation. Multivariate analysis was performed to assess the predictive value of each kinetic parameter on survival. Our results showed that in the primary cases (n=46), SUV, k1, Ki and FD were higher in sarcomas than benign tumors. The diagnostic sensitivity of 62.50%, a specificity of 92.86%, and an accuracy of 71.74% were achieved by using the combination of k1 and SUV as input variables for DA. In the postoperative cases (n=71), SUV, VB, k3, Ki, and FD were higher in recurrent lesions than in scar tissues. DA revealed a sensitivity of 80.85%, a specificity of 87.50%, and an accuracy of 83.10% by using the combination of SUV, Ki and FD. In liposarcoma patients (n=32), SUV and FD were higher in GII,III tumors as compared with GI. DA led to a sensitivity of 86.96%, a specificity of 55.56%, and an accuracy of 78.13% by using the combination of SUV and FD. By multivariate analysis of primary soft tissue sarcomas (n=26) after surgical resection, groups with k3>0.025 (P<0.0026) or FD>1.25 (P<0.0162) had significantly poor prognosis. In conclusion, the evaluation of full (18)F-FDG kinetics provides important information for the diagnosis of malignant lesions, histological grading and prognosis of soft tissue sarcomas.

Mechanical and swelling characterization of poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide -co- methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate) sol-gels. The dimensional stability and rheological properties of a series of comb-like copolymers of N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAAm) and methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) methacrylate (mPEGMA), poly(NIPAAm-co-mPEGMA), with varying poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) graft densities and molecular weights were studied. The thermoresponsive character of the copolymer solutions was investigated by kinetic and equilibrium swelling, as well as by static and dynamic mechanical analysis. Surface response mapping was employed to target particular compositions and concentrations with excellent dimensional stability and a relatively large change in dynamic mechanical properties upon thermoreversible gelation. The mechanical characteristics of the gels depended strongly upon concentration of total polymer and less so upon copolymer ratio. Increased PEG graft density was shown to slow the deswelling rate and increase the equilibrium water content of the gels. Upon gelation at sol concentrations of 1-20 wt.% the materials underwent no deswelling or syneresis and maintained stable gels with a large elastic regime and high yield strain (i.e. elastic and soft but tough), even within the Pascal range of complex shear moduli. These materials are unique in that they maintained a physiologically useful lower critical solution temperature (approximately 33 degrees C), despite having a high PEG content. Copolymers with a high PEG content and low polymer fraction were conveniently transparent in the gel phase, allowing visualization of cellular activity without disrupting the microenvironment. Mesenchymal stem cells showed good viability and proliferation in three-dimensional culture within the gels, despite the lack of ligand incorporation to promote cellular interaction. Multi-component matrices can be created through simple mixing of copolymer solutions and peptide-conjugated linear polymers and proteins to produce combinatorial microenvironments with the potential for use in cell biology, tissue engineering and medical applications.

Effect of educational outreach on general practice prescribing of antibiotics and antidepressants: a two-year randomised controlled trial. Prescribing of broad spectrum antibiotics and antidepressants in general practice often does not accord with guidelines. The aim was to determine the effectiveness of educational outreach in improving the prescribing of selected antibiotics and antidepressants, and whether the effect is sustained for two years. Single blind randomized trial. Twenty-eight general practices in Leicestershire, England. Educational outreach visits were undertaken, tailored to barriers to change, 14 practices receiving visits for reducing selected antibiotics and 14 for improving antidepressant prescribing. Number of items prescribed per 1000 registered patients for amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (co-amoxiclav) and quinolone antibiotics, and average daily quantities per 1000 patients for lofepramine and fluoxetine antidepressants, measured at the practice level for six-month periods over two years. There was no effect on the prescribing of co-amoxiclav, quinolones, or fluoxetine, but prescribing of lofepramine increased in accordance with the guidelines. The increase persisted throughout two years of follow-up. A simple, group-level educational outreach intervention, designed to take account of identified barriers to change, can have a modest but sustained effect on prescribing levels. However, outreach is not always effective. The context in which change in prescribing practice is being sought, the views of prescribers concerning the value of the drug, or other unrecognised barriers to change may influence the effectiveness of outreach.

Arrival and establishment of Aedes japonicus japonicus (Diptera: Culicidae) in Iowa. The arrival and establishment of Aedes (Finlaya) japonicus japonicus (Theobald) (Diptera: Culicidae) in Iowa are reported. In total, 518 wild adult specimens were collected through the statewide mosquito and mosquito-borne virus surveillance program in 2007 and 2008. Specimens were collected with New Jersey light traps, CO2-baited CDC light traps, grass infusion-baited gravid traps, and Mosquito Magnet traps located in 12 counties in central and eastern Iowa Specimens were identified morphologically, and identity was further supported by molecular DNA barcoding. Specimens also were tested for infection with West Nile virus (family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, WNV) and La Crosse virus (family Bunyaviridae, genus Bunyavirus, LACV) by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Although no specimens tested positive for arbovirus infection, the arrival of Ae. j. japonicus in Iowa is a public health concern considering its potential to transmit several arboviruses, particularly WNV and LACV.

[Long-term survivors of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: characterisation and prognostic factors in a retrospective study]. The prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is poor, especially for advanced stages IIIB-IV. Clinical experience shows that the evolution of the disease is heterogeneous. A small number of patients survive more than 2 years after diagnosis; they are called long term survivors (LS). The aim of our study was to characterise this subgroup of patients. A retrospective study in the respiratory department of a general hospital including all patients with a proven diagnosis of NSCLC stage IIIB and IV. 169 patients were included (43 females). There were 13.6% LS. Two thirds of the patients were PS 0-1, 84.6% were stage IIIBw-IV. Adenocarcinoma was the predominant histological type. Univariate analysis revealed that long term survival was associated with a Charlson's score < or = 2, PS 0-1, a normal white blood cell count at diagnosis, adenocarcinoma histology, response (RP) to first line treatment and treatment with a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI). In multivariate analysis only PS 0-1, RP and treatment with a TKI were independent factors for longer survival. LS exist and represent 13.6% of our patients. TKI appear to offer new opportunities for these patients.

Effects of antibiotic-impregnated external ventricular drains on bacterial culture results: an in vitro analysis. Treatment of ventriculoperitoneal shunt infections frequently requires placement of an external ventricular drain (EVD). Surveillance specimens obtained from antibiotic-impregnated (AI) EVDs may be less likely to demonstrate bacterial growth, potentially resulting in undertreatment of an infection. The purpose of this study was to assess whether AI EVDs had any significant effect on bacterial culture results compared with nonantibiotic-impregnated (NAI) EVDs. In vitro assays were performed using AI EVDs containing minocycline and rifampin (VentriClear II, Medtronic) and NAI EVD controls (Bioglide, Medtronic). The presence of antibiotics was evaluated via capillary electrophoresis of sterile saline drawn from AI and NAI EVDs after predefined incubation intervals. Antimicrobial activity was assessed by evaluating zones of inhibition created by the catheter aspirates on plates inoculated with a quality control strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis (American Type Culture Collection strain 12228). To determine the effects of cultures drawn through AI compared with NAI EVDs, the quality control strain was then incubated within 4 new AI and 4 new NAI EVDs for predefined intervals before being plated on culture media. Spread and streak plate culture results from each type of catheter were compared at each time interval. Capillary electrophoresis showed that more minocycline than rifampin was eluted from the AI EVDs. Sterile saline samples incubated within the AI EVDs demonstrated zones of growth inhibition when placed on plates of S. epidermidis at all time intervals tested. No zones of inhibition were noted on NAI EVD control plates. When a standardized inoculum of S. epidermidis was drawn through AI and NAI EVDs, antimicrobial effects were observed after incubation in the AI EVD group only. Colony counting demonstrated that significantly fewer colonies resulted from samples drawn through AI compared with NAI EVDs at the multiple time intervals. Similarly, streak plating yielded a statistically significant number of false-negative results from AI compared with NAI EVDs at 2 time intervals. The findings in the current study indicate that the risk of a false-negative culture result may be increased when a CSF sample is drawn through an AI catheter. In the management of a known shunt infection, a false-negative result from an EVD culture specimen may lead to an inappropriately short duration of antibiotic therapy. These data have significant clinical implications, particularly given the widespread use of AI drains and the current high rates of shunt reinfection after EVD use worldwide.

Cervical carcinoma: postoperative radiotherapy: fifteen-year experience in a Norwegian health region.

Hippocampo-cerebellar theta band phase synchrony in rabbits. Hippocampal functioning, in the form of theta band oscillation, has been shown to modulate and predict cerebellar learning of which rabbit eyeblink conditioning is perhaps the most well-known example. The contribution of hippocampal neural activity to cerebellar learning is only possible if there is a functional connection between the two structures. Here, in the context of trace eyeblink conditioning, we show (1) that, in addition to the hippocampus, prominent theta oscillation also occurs in the cerebellum, and (2) that cerebellar theta oscillation is synchronized with that in the hippocampus. Further, the degree of phase synchrony (PS) increased both as a response to the conditioning stimuli and as a function of the relative power of hippocampal theta oscillation. However, the degree of PS did not change as a function of either training or learning nor did it predict learning rate as the hippocampal theta ratio did. Nevertheless, theta band synchronization might reflect the formation of transient neural assemblies between the hippocampus and the cerebellum. These findings help us understand how hippocampal function can affect eyeblink conditioning, during which the critical plasticity occurs in the cerebellum. Future studies should examine cerebellar unit activity in relation to hippocampal theta oscillations in order to discover the detailed mechanisms of theta-paced neural activity.

Toxic effects of T-2 toxin on reproductive system in male mice. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effects of T-2 toxin on semen quality, fertility and serum testosterone concentration in mice. Adult male mice were mated with sexually mature untreated female mice after being exposed to intraperitoneal injection of T-2 toxin at 0, 5, 10 or 15 mg/kg body weight daily for 7 successive days. Semen quality, serum testosterone concentration and fertility of treated mice were assessed. The results showed that the number of abnormal spermatozoa increased significantly and a significant decrease in spermatozoa with integrated acrosome was observed in males treated with T-2 toxin at all doses, As well, the amount of live spermatozoa decreased significantly in mice treated with 10 and 15 mg/kg body weight T-2 toxin. Low pregnancy rate and high fetal resorption rate were observed when females were mated with T-2 toxin-exposed males. Testicular and cauda epididymal sperm counts, efficiency of sperm production and serum testosterone concentration were significantly reduced in mice treated with T-2 toxin at all doses in a dose-dependent manner. In conclusion, these findings indicated that T-2 toxin presented toxic effects on reproductive system of adult male mice.

Angiotensin II in experimental hyperdynamic sepsis. Angiotensin II (Ang II) is a potential vasopressor treatment for hypotensive hyperdynamic sepsis. However, unlike other vasopressors, its systemic, regional blood flow and renal functional effects in hypotensive hyperdynamic sepsis have not been investigated. We performed an experimental randomised placebo-controlled animal study. We induced hyperdynamic sepsis by the intravenous administration of live E. coli in conscious ewes after chronic instrumentation with flow probes around the aorta and the renal, mesenteric, coronary and iliac arteries. We allocated animals to either placebo or angiotensin II infusion titrated to maintain baseline blood pressure. Hyperdynamic sepsis was associated with increased renal blood flow (from 292 +/- 61 to 397 +/- 74 ml/min), oliguria and a decrease in creatinine clearance (from 88.7 +/- 19.6 to 47.7 +/- 21.0 ml/min, P < 0.0001). Compared to placebo, Ang II infusion restored arterial pressure but reduced renal blood flow (from 359 +/- 81 ml/min to 279 +/- 86 ml/min; P < 0.0001). However, despite the reduction in renal blood flow, Ang II increased urine output approximately 7-fold (364 +/- 272 ml/h vs. 48 +/- 18 ml/h; P < 0.0001), and creatinine clearance by 70% (to 80.6 +/- 20.7 ml/min vs.46.0 +/- 26 ml/min; P < 0.0001). There were no major effects of Ang II on other regional blood flows. In early experimental hypotensive hyperdynamic sepsis, intravenous angiotensin II infusion decreased renal blood while inducing a marked increase in urine output and normalizing creatinine clearance.

Meta-analyses qualify metzincins and related genes as acute rejection markers in renal transplant patients. Definition of acute renal allograft rejection (AR) markers remains clinically relevant. Features of T-cell-mediated AR are tubulointerstitial and vascular inflammation associated with excessive extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, regulated by metzincins, including matrix metalloproteases (MMP). Our study focused on expression of metzincins (METS), and metzincins and related genes (MARGS) in renal allograft biopsies using four independent microarray data sets. Our own cases included normal histology (N, n = 20), borderline changes (BL, n = 4), AR (n = 10) and AR + IF/TA (n = 7). MARGS enriched in all data sets were further examined on mRNA and/or protein level in additional patients. METS and MARGS differentiated AR from BL, AR + IF/TA and N in a principal component analysis. Their expression changes correlated to Banff t- and i-scores. Two AR classifiers, based on METS (including MMP7, TIMP1), or on MARGS were established in our own and validated in the three additional data sets. Thirteen MARGS were significantly enriched in AR patients of all data sets comprising MMP7, -9, TIMP1, -2, thrombospondin2 (THBS2) and fibrillin1. RT-PCR using microdissected glomeruli/tubuli confirmed MMP7, -9 and THBS2 microarray results; immunohistochemistry showed augmentation of MMP2, -9 and TIMP1 in AR. TIMP1 and THBS2 were enriched in AR patient serum. Therefore, differentially expressed METS and MARGS especially TIMP1, MMP7/-9 represent potential molecular AR markers.

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS): development of conceptual models of health-related quality of life (HRQL) for caregivers and children. LGS is a severe form of childhood epilepsy which is characterized by multiple seizures and cognitive impairment. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 40 parents of children with LGS in the US, UK, and Italy. Parents were asked to report on their perceptions of the HRQL of their child and also to describe the impact on their own HRQL. Thematic analysis was conducted to develop themes relating to the impact on HRQL. The themes were organized into conceptual models of the impact of LGS on the HRQL of the parent and the child. The models demonstrate the complex relationships between the components of LGS and their impact on HRQL.

Utilization of advanced imaging technologies for target delineation in radiation oncology. The aim of this study was to evaluate the utilization of advanced imaging technologies for target delineation among radiation oncologists in the United States. A random sample of 1,600 radiation oncologists was contacted by Internet, e-mail, and fax and questioned regarding the use of advanced imaging technologies, clinical applications, and future plans for use. Advanced imaging technologies were defined as any of the following that were directly incorporated into radiation therapy planning: MRI, PET, single-photon emission CT, 4-D CT, functional MRI, and MR spectroscopy. Of 1,089 contactable physicians, 394 (36%) responded. Of respondents, 65% were in private practice and 35% were in academic practice. The proportion using any advanced imaging technology for target delineation was 95%. However, the majority reported only rare (in <25% of their patients; 46.6%) or infrequent (in 25%-50% of their patients; 26.0%) utilization. The most commonly used technologies were 2-[(18)F]fluoro-2-deoxyglucose PET (76%), MRI (72%), and 4-D CT (44%). The most common cancers treated using image-guided target delineation were those of the lung (83%), central nervous system (79%), and head and neck (79%). Among users of advanced imaging technologies, 66% planned to increase use; 30% of nonusers planned to adopt these technologies in the future. Advanced imaging technologies are widely used by US radiation oncologists for target delineation. Although the majority of respondents used them in <50% of their patients, the frequency of utilization is expected to increase. Studies determining the optimal application of these technologies in radiation therapy planning are needed.

Occurrence of anti-Toxoplasma gondii antibodies in female cattle in south-west of Iran. Toxoplasmosis, caused by Toxoplasma gondii, is a significant disease in livestock and humans. In Iran, studies shows that T. gondii infection in humans is relatively high and prevalence is associated mainly with consumption of undercooked meat or meat products. We have examined 450 serum samples from female cattle distributed over all Ahvaz, the center of Khouzestan province, south-west of Iran. IgG antibodies to T. gondii were assayed by the modified agglutination test using whole tachyzoites of T. gondii, and found in 71 (15.77%) of 450 cattle with titers of 1:25 in 38, 1:50 in 18, 1:100 in 11, 1:200 in three and 1:400 in one. Titers of antibodies were decreased in cattle over 2 years old. These results indicate that T. gondii infection in cattle of Khouzestan is relatively considerable, but not very high and consumption of beef may be a source of infection for humans in south-west of Iran.

PCR-free detection of genetically modified organisms using magnetic capture technology and fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy. The safety of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) has attracted much attention recently. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification is a common method used in the identification of GMOs. However, a major disadvantage of PCR is the potential amplification of non-target DNA, causing false-positive identification. Thus, there remains a need for a simple, reliable and ultrasensitive method to identify and quantify GMO in crops. This report is to introduce a magnetic bead-based PCR-free method for rapid detection of GMOs using dual-color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS). The cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter commonly used in transgenic products was targeted. CaMV35S target was captured by a biotin-labeled nucleic acid probe and then purified using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads through biotin-streptavidin linkage. The purified target DNA fragment was hybridized with two nucleic acid probes labeled respectively by Rhodamine Green and Cy5 dyes. Finally, FCCS was used to detect and quantify the target DNA fragment through simultaneously detecting the fluorescence emissions from the two dyes. In our study, GMOs in genetically engineered soybeans and tomatoes were detected, using the magnetic bead-based PCR-free FCCS method. A detection limit of 50 pM GMOs target was achieved and PCR-free detection of GMOs from 5 microg genomic DNA with magnetic capture technology was accomplished. Also, the accuracy of GMO determination by the FCCS method is verified by spectrophotometry at 260 nm using PCR amplified target DNA fragment from GM tomato. The new method is rapid and effective as demonstrated in our experiments and can be easily extended to high-throughput and automatic screening format. We believe that the new magnetic bead-assisted FCCS detection technique will be a useful tool for PCR-free GMOs identification and other specific nucleic acids.

Cancer imaging and therapy with metal nanoparticles. Nanotechnology offers unique opportunities for cancer detection, therapy and the ability to monitor therapeutic interventions. This potential has to be analyzed in context of challenges that need to be overcome in translation of nanoparticles to clinical applications including specific delivery in tissues and clearance from the body. Here, we will present a case study of plasmonic nanoparticles in cancer imaging and therapy.

Precocious bilateral hip joint osteoarthritis is a "form-fruste" of the arthropathy of hereditary haemochromatosis. Osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip joint is a common disorder, especially in aging peoples of Caucasian descent. Hip OA like OA in other joints is heterogeneous and may manifest in early or late adult life. The aetiology of early onset (precocious) bilateral hip OA is poorly understood, but the clinical and radiological characteristics of this form of OA suggest that chondral resorption due to biochemical or metabolic factors is likely to be of pre-eminent importance. The hip arthropathy which occurs in Hereditary Haemochromatosis (HH) and the ostensibly idiopathic precocious bilateral concentric form of hip OA are virtually indistinguishable. Accordingly, the possibility exists that the causal factors for these conditions may be very similar. On the basis of this premise and in the light of the finding in a small observational study that HFE gene mutations are very common in precocious bilateral hip OA (100% amongst 8 sequentially collected patients), it is hypothesised that precocious bilateral hip OA is a "form-fruste" of the arthropathy of HH in which HFE gene mutation mediated articular iron deposition in hip joint tissues may be of pivotal pathogenetic importance. Confirmation of this hypothesis could have implications for the prevention and strategic medical management of this form of OA.

Differential Antioxidant Responses and Perturbed Porphyrin Biosynthesis after Exposure to Oxyfluorfen and Methyl Viologen in Oryza sativa. We compared antioxidant responses and regulation of porphyrin metabolism in rice plants treated with oxyfluorfen (OF) or methyl viologen (MV). Plants treated with MV exhibited not only greater increases in conductivity and malondialdehyde but also a greater decline in Fv/Fm, compared to plants treated with OF. MV-treated plants had greater increases in activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) as well as transcript levels of SODA and CATA than OF-treated plants after 28 h of the treatments, whereas increases in ascorbate peroxidase (APX) activity and transcript levels of APXA and APXB were greater in OF-treated plants. Both OF- and MV-treated plants resulted in not only down-regulation of most genes involved in porphyrin biosynthesis but also disappearance of Mg-porphyrins during the late stage of photooxidative stress. By contrast, up-regulation of heme oxygenase 2 (HO2) is possibly part of an efficient antioxidant response to compensate photooxidative damage in both treatments. Our data show that down-regulated biosynthesis and degradation dynamics of porphyrin intermediates have important roles in photoprotection of plants from perturbed porphyrin biosynthesis and photosynthetic electron transport. This study suggests that porphyrin scavenging as well as strong antioxidative activities are required for mitigating reactive oxygen species (ROS) production under photooxidative stress caused by OF and MV. 

Biogenesis and structure of a type VI secretion membrane core complex. Bacteria share their ecological niches with other microbes. The bacterial type VI secretion system is one of the key players in microbial competition, as well as being an important virulence determinant during bacterial infections. It assembles a nano-crossbow-like structure in the cytoplasm of the attacker cell that propels an arrow made of a haemolysin co-regulated protein (Hcp) tube and a valine-glycine repeat protein G (VgrG) spike and punctures the prey's cell wall. The nano-crossbow is stably anchored to the cell envelope of the attacker by a membrane core complex. Here we show that this complex is assembled by the sequential addition of three type VI subunits (Tss)-TssJ, TssM and TssL-and present a structure of the fully assembled complex at 11.6 Ã resolution, determined by negative-stain electron microscopy. With overall C5 symmetry, this 1.7-megadalton complex comprises a large base in the cytoplasm. It extends in the periplasm via ten arches to form a double-ring structure containing the carboxy-terminal domain of TssM (TssMct) and TssJ that is anchored in the outer membrane. The crystal structure of the TssMct-TssJ complex coupled to whole-cell accessibility studies suggest that large conformational changes induce transient pore formation in the outer membrane, allowing passage of the attacking Hcp tube/VgrG spike.

Investigation of the composition of anabolic tablets using near infrared spectroscopy and Raman chemical imaging. The use of performance enhancing drugs is a widespread phenomenon in professional and leisure sports. A spectroscopic study was carried out on anabolic tablets labelled as 5 mg methandienone tablets provided by police departments. The analytical approach was based on a two-step methodology: a fast analysis of tablets using near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy to assess sample homogeneity based on their global composition, followed by Raman chemical imaging of one sample per NIR profile to obtain information on sample formulation. NIR spectroscopy assisted by a principal components analysis (PCA) enabled fast discrimination of different profiles based on the excipient formulation. Raman hyperspectral imaging and multivariate curve resolution - alternating least square (MCR-ALS) provided chemical images of the distribution of the active substance and excipients within tablets and facilitated identification of the active compounds. The combination of NIR spectroscopy and Raman chemical imaging highlighted dose-to-dose variations and succeeded in the discrimination of four different formulations out of eight similar samples of anabolic tablets. Some samples contained either methandienone or methyltestosterone whereas one sample did not contain an active substance. Other ingredients were sucrose, lactose, starch or talc. Both techniques were fast and non-destructive and therefore can be carried out as exploratory methods prior to destructive screening methods. Copyright Â© 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. 


Antenatal corticosteroids and neonatal outcomes according to gestational age: a cohort study.

Localization of seizure onset area from intracranial non-seizure EEG by exploiting locally enhanced synchrony. For as many as 30% of epilepsy patients, seizures are poorly controlled with medication alone. For some of these patients surgery may be an option: the brain region responsible for seizure onset may be removed surgically. However, this requires accurate delineation of the seizure onset region. Currently, the key to making this determination is seizure EEG. Therefore, EEG recordings must continue until enough seizures are obtained to determine the onset region; this may take about 5 days to several weeks. In some cases these recordings must be done using invasive electrodes, a procedure that includes substantial risk, discomfort and cost. In this paper, techniques are developed that use periods of intracranial non-seizure ("rest") EEG to localize epileptogenic networks. Analysis of intracranial EEG (recorded by surface and/or depth electrodes) of 6 epileptic patients shows that certain EEG channels and hence cortical regions are consistently more synchronous ("hypersynchronous") compared to others. It is shown that hypersynchrony seems to strongly correlate with the seizure onset zone; this phenomenon may in the long term allow to determine the seizure onset area(s) from non-seizure EEG, which in turn would enable shorter hospitalizations or even avoidance of semi-chronic implantations all-together.

Comparative Effectiveness of Chemotherapy Regimens in Prolonging Survival for Two Large Population-Based Cohorts of Elderly Adults with Breast and Colon Cancer in 1992-2009. To compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy in prolonging survival according to age in breast and colon cancer. Retrospective cohort study with a matched cohort analysis based on the conditional probability of receiving chemotherapy. The 16 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) areas from the SEER-Medicare linked database. Women diagnosed with Stage I to IIIa hormone receptor-negative breast cancer (n = 14,440) and 26,893 men and women with Stage III colon cancer (n = 26,893) aged 65 and older in 1992 to 2009. The main exposure was the receipt of chemotherapy, and the main outcome was mortality. In women with breast cancer aged 65 to 69, the risk of all-cause mortality was statistically significantly lower in those who received chemotherapy than in those who did not in the entire cohort (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.70, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.57-0.88) and in a propensity-matched cohort (HR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.70-0.96) after adjusting for measured confounders. These patterns were similar in participants aged 70 to 74 and 75 to 79, but in women aged 80 to 84 and 85 to 89, risk of all-cause mortality was no longer significantly lower in those receiving chemotherapy in the entire and matched cohorts, except that, in a small number of women who received doxorubicin (Adriamycin) and cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), risk of mortality was significantly lower for those aged 80 to 84. Chemotherapy appeared to be effective in all ages from 65 through 84 in participants with Stage III colon cancer. For example, in those aged 85 to 89, chemotherapy was significantly associated with lower risk of mortality in the entire cohort (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.67-0.92) and the matched cohort (HR = 0.79, 95% CI = 0.66-0.95). The effectiveness of chemotherapy decreased with age in participants with breast cancer, in whom chemotherapy appears to be effective until age 79 except for the doxorubicin-cyclophosphamide combination, which was effective in participants aged 80 to 84. In individuals with Stage III colon cancer, chemotherapy appears to be effective to age 89. These findings were consistent with those of randomized clinical trials.

Introduction and establishment of the exotic mosquito species Aedes japonicus japonicus (Diptera: Culicidae) in Belgium. The establishment of the potential vector species Aedes (Finlaya) japonicusjaponicus (Theobald) (Diptera: Culicidae) in southern Belgium is reported. The species was most likely introduced through the international trade in used tires. It was first collected in 2002 on the premises of a second-hand tire company and was sampled using different sampling methods in the two consecutive years (2003-2004). It was only in 2007 and 2008, during a national mosquito survey (MODIRISK), that its presence as adults and larvae at the above-mentioned site and at another tire company in the area was confirmed based on morphological and molecular identification. This discovery is the first record for Belgium of an exotic mosquito species that established successfully and raises the question on the need for monitoring and control. Considering the accompanying species found during the surveys, we also report here the first observation of Culex (Maillotia) hortensis hortensis (Ficalbi) in Belgium.

CD70 expression by dendritic cells plays a critical role in the immunogenicity of CD40-independent, CD4+ T cell-dependent, licensed CD8+ T cell responses. The stimulation of DC by CD4(+) T cells is known to condition DC to activate naÃ¯ve CD8(+) T cells, predominantly via CD40-CD40L interactions. It has been proposed that a critical consequence of DC conditioning is the induction of CD70 expression. Whether and how CD70 induction contributes to CD8(+) T cell responses in the absence of CD40-CD40L interactions are unknown. CD8(+) T cell responses to adenoviral- or DC-based immunization of CD40-deficient mice revealed a CD40-independent, CD4(+) T cell-dependent pathway for CD70 induction on conventional DC. This pathway and subsequent CD8(+) T cell responses were enhanced by, but not dependent on, concomitant activation of TLR and in part, used TRANCE and LIGHT/LTalphabeta stimulation. Blocking TRANCE and LIGHT/LTalphabeta during stimulation reduced the immunogenicity of CD40-deficient DC. These data support the hypothesis that induction of CD70 expression on DC after an encounter with activated CD4(+) T cells is a major component of CD4(+) T cell-mediated licensing of DC. Further, multiple pathways exist for CD4(+) T cells to elicit CD70 expression on DC. These data in part explain the capacity of CD40-deficient mice to mount CD8(+) T cell responses and may provide additional targets for immunotherapy in situations when CD40-mediated licensing is compromised.

To compare the anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects of the different water extracts which were prepared by regular decoction time or removing volatie oil and ethanol extracts which were prepared in different concentration ethanol of Xixin (the roots and rhizomes of Asarum heterotropoides var. mandshuricum), and then to investigate the anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive mechanisms. Xylene-induced ICR mouse ear edema and hot plate test were utilized to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects of Xixin at different dose level (water extracts of regular decoction time or removing volatie oil at the dose of 0.8 g x kg(-1) and 1.6 g x kg(-1); 95% ethanol extracts at the dose of 0.91 g x kg(-1) and 1.82 g x kg(-1); 50% ethanol extracts at the dose of 0.76 g x kg(-1) and 1.52 g x kg(-1)). Xylene-induced adrenalectomized mouse ear edema model was used to study the anti-inflammatory mechanisms. To reveal the anti-nociceptive mechanisms, mice were pretreated with naloxone in the hot plate test. The water extracts significantly reduced the weight of ear edema as compared with control group. Inhibition ratios were 43.20% and 63.69% at the higher dose, respectively. The ethanol extracts also significantly reduced the weight of ear edema and the inhibition ratios were 61.86% and 52. 56% at the higher dose, respectively. Mice administered water extracts delayed the latency times in the hot plate test. The anti-nociceptive effects of water extracts peaked at 2.0 h after i.g. administration. The hot plate latency times were increased by 51.27%, 62.78%, 60.08% and 68.00% at peak time, respectively. Regular decoction time group showed more significant effects in both models. The anti-inflammatory effect of 95% ethanol extracts was similar to 50% ethanol extracts. The water extracts were not effective in reducing xylene-induced adrenalectomized mouse ear edema. The anti-nociceptive effect of water extracts was blocked by naloxone. Both the water extracts and ethanol extracts of Xixin showed considerable anti-inflammatory potency against xylene induced inflammation. The water extracts produced anti-nociception in thermal model. The water extracts prepared in regular decoction time showed better anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects. Both the 95% ethanol and 50% ethanol extracts showed similarly anti-inflammatory effects. The anti-inflammatory effect of water extracts related to adrenal gland. The anti-nociceptive effect of water extracts was involved in activating opioid receptor.

Management of schizophrenia with medical disorders: cardiovascular, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal. Medical illnesses are particularly common in patients who have schizophrenia and one of the major tasks for consultation-liaison psychiatrists, and others, is to determine which medications are safest in which co-morbid condition. The authors review the relative risks for various antipsychotics, especially focusing on cardiovascular, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal co-morbid illnesses. The authors further review the atypical antipsychotics' cardiovascular risks, especially for prolonging QT intervals, in trying to avoid the risk for torsades de pointes. The relative risk for anticholinergic actions for these medicines is also reviewed, as this is especially important in the medically ill or elderly. The authors also review the relative safety of antipsychotics in patients who have liver disease and pulmonary disease. Finally, the authors review specific drug interactions that may be problematic when treating the medically ill with atypical antipsychotics.

Effects of tramadol hydrochloride on the thermal threshold in cats. OBJECTIVE-To determine the thermal antinociceptive effect of oral administration of tramadol hydrochloride at doses between 0.5 and 4 mg/kg in cats. ANIMALS-6 healthy adult domestic shorthair cats. PROCEDURES-Baseline (before drug administration; time 0) thermal threshold was determined by applying a thermal probe to the thorax of each cat. Tramadol (0.5, 1, 2, 3, or 4 mg/kg) or a placebo was then administered orally in accordance with a Latin square design. Thermal threshold was determined by an observer who was unaware of treatment at various times until thermal threshold returned to baseline values or 6 hours had elapsed. Plasma tramadol and O-desmethyl-tramadol concentrations were measured prior to drug administration and at 1-hour intervals thereafter. Effect-concentration data were fitted to effect maximum models. RESULTS-Highest plasma tramadol and O-desmethyl-tramadol concentrations increased with increasing tramadol dose. Significant effects of dose and time on thermal threshold were detected. Thermal threshold was significantly higher than the baseline value at 80 and 120 minutes for the 0.5 mg/kg dose, at 80 and from 120 to 360 minutes for the 2 mg/kg dose, from 40 to 360 minutes for the 3 mg/kg dose, and from 60 to 360 minutes for the 4 mg/kg dose. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE-Tramadol induced thermal antinociception in cats. Doses of 2 to 4 mg/kg appeared necessary for induction of significant and sustained analgesic effects. Simulations predicted that 4 mg/kg every 6 hours would maintain analgesia close to the maximum effect of tramadol.


Viral dark matter and virus-host interactions resolved from publicly available microbial genomes.

Pharmacotherapy of diabetic foot osteomyelitis. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) complicates about 20% of diabetic foot infections (DFIs) and increases the risk of lower extremity amputation. This contentious infection is important to discuss, given the frequency with which diabetes mellitus and its complications occur and the devastating consequences of amputation. The diagnosis and management of DFO is complicated by the diverse presentations, delayed recognition, poorly defined diagnostic criteria, and lack of validated treatment regimens. Major issues of concern include when to undertake bone resection surgery and which antimicrobial agents to use, by what route, and for how long. Patients in whom DFO is suspected are best cared for by a multidisciplinary team, including infectious disease physicians or clinical microbiologists, orthopaedic, plastic and vascular surgeons, diabetologists, primary care physicians, podiatrists and specialist (especially tissue viability) nurses. Such multidisciplinary teams have repeatedly been shown to improve disease outcomes. We herein analyse the limited, and recently published, literature on the pharmacotherapy of DFO and put it into the broader context of management of DFI and osteomyelitis.

Role of the nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein 3 inflammasome in acute kidney injury. Acute kidney injury (AKI), which is associated with high mortality rates, involves renal inflammation related to the activation of innate immunity. The inflammatory response in AKI involves the inflammasome, which integrates danger signals into caspase-1-activating platforms, leading to the processing and secretion of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1Î² and IL-18. The nucleotide-binding domain-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome plays a role in the development of many diseases, including AKI. However, the mechanisms by which the NLRP3 inflammasome translates different danger signals into the expression of proinflammatory cytokines remain unclear. Here, we investigated the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in renal injury in a cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model of sepsis-induced AKI. CLP decreased blood pressure and increased serum creatinine levels and neutrophil infiltration into the kidney in parallel with the upregulation of NLRP3, the adaptor protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein, and caspase-1 expression and activity in kidney tissues, and increases in the serum and kidney levels of IL-1Î² and IL-18. Genetic deletion of NLRP3 reversed the CLP-induced reduction in blood pressure and increases in serum creatinine level and neutrophil infiltration, and attenuated the CLP-induced upregulation of apoptosis-associated speck-like protein, caspase-1 expression and activity, and the secretion of IL-1Î² and IL-18, similarly to the effects of caspase-1 inhibition. Taken together, our results indicate that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome contributes to the development of hypotension and the inflammatory response of AKI, suggesting its possible role as a therapeutic target for the treatment of kidney diseases. 


L-serine synthesis in the central nervous system: a review on serine deficiency disorders.

Calpain activation and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger degradation occur downstream of calcium deregulation in hippocampal neurons exposed to excitotoxic glutamate. Delayed calcium deregulation (DCD) plays an essential role in glutamate excitotoxicity, a major detrimental factor in stroke, traumatic brain injury, and various neurodegenerations. In the present study, we examined the role of calpain activation and Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) degradation in DCD and excitotoxic cell death in cultured hippocampal neurons. Exposure of neurons to glutamate caused DCD accompanied by secondary mitochondrial depolarization. Activation of calpain was evidenced by detecting NCX isoform 3 (NCX3) degradation products. Degradation of NCX isoform 1 (NCX1) was below the detection limit of Western blotting. Degradation of NCX3 was detected only after 1 hr of incubation with glutamate, whereas DCD occurred on average within 15 min after glutamate application. Calpeptin, an inhibitor of calpain, significantly attenuated NCX3 degradation but failed to inhibit DCD and excitotoxic neuronal death. Calpain inhibitors I, III, and VI also failed to influence DCD and glutamate-induced neuronal death. On the other hand, MK801, an inhibitor of the NMDA subtype of glutamate receptors, added shortly after the initial glutamate-induced jump in cytosolic Ca(2+), completely prevented DCD and activation of calpain and strongly protected neurons against excitotoxicity. Taken together, our results suggest that, in glutamate-treated hippocampal neurons, the initial increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) that precedes DCD is insufficient for sustained calpain activation, which most likely occurs downstream of DCD.

Combining predictive capabilities of transcranial doppler with electrocardiogram to predict hemorrhagic shock. Hemorrhagic shock (HS) potentially impacts the chance of survival in most traumatic injuries. Thus, it is highly desirable to maximize the survival rate in cases of blood loss by predicting the occurrence of hemorrhagic shock with biomedical signals. Since analyzing one physiological signal may not enough to accurately predict blood loss severity, two types of physiological signals - Electrocardiography (ECG) and Transcranial Doppler (TCD) - are used to discover the degree of severity. In this study, these degrees are classified as mild, moderate and severe, and also severe and non-severe. The data for this study were generated using the human simulated model of hemorrhage, which is called lower body negative pressure (LBNP). The analysis is done by applying discrete wavelet transformation (DWT). The wavelet-based features are defined using the detail and approximate coefficients and machine learning algorithms are used for classification. The objective of this study is to evaluate the improvement when analyzing ECG and TCD physiological signals together to classify the severity of blood loss. The results of this study show a prediction accuracy of 85.9% achieved by support vector machine in identifying severe/non-severe states.


Evaluation of spatial interpolation strategies for the removal of comb-structure in fiber-optic images.

Metabolomics: Applications and Promise in Mycobacterial Disease. Until recently, the study of mycobacterial diseases was trapped in culture-based technology that is more than a century old. The use of nucleic acid amplification is changing this, and powerful new technologies are on the horizon. Metabolomics, which is the study of sets of metabolites of both the bacteria and host, is being used to clarify mechanisms of disease, and can identify changes leading to better diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication of mycobacterial diseases. Metabolomic profiles are arrays of biochemical products of genes in their environment. These complex patterns are biomarkers that can allow a more complete understanding of cell function, dysfunction, and perturbation than genomics or proteomics. Metabolomics could herald sweeping advances in personalized medicine and clinical trial design, but the challenges in metabolomics are also great. Measured metabolite concentrations vary with the timing within a condition, the intrinsic biology, the instruments, and the sample preparation. Metabolism profoundly changes with age, sex, variations in gut microbial flora, and lifestyle. Validation of biomarkers is complicated by measurement accuracy, selectivity, linearity, reproducibility, robustness, and limits of detection. The statistical challenges include analysis, interpretation, and description of the vast amount of data generated. Despite these drawbacks, metabolomics provides great opportunity and the potential to understand and manage mycobacterial diseases. 

High-intensity interval exercise training improves heart rate variability in patients following percutaneous coronary intervention for angina pectoris. Low time domain measures of heart rate variability (HRV) have been shown to predict outcome after myocardial infarction (MI). The predictive value of HRV, when measured in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) without MI is less clear. Further, little is known about the mechanisms of how autonomic imbalance affects outcome. Forty patients following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with stent implantation for angina pectoris were prospectively randomized to a six month supervised high-intensity interval training program (n=20) or to a control group (n=20). All patients underwent a 24-hour Holter monitoring to assess measures of HRV at baseline and at six months. At baseline there were no significant differences between groups. In the training group all time domain indices and the frequency domain indices, total power and ultralow frequency of HRV, increased significantly during the training period. Mean heart rate decreased significantly. In the control group only the root mean square of differences between successive NN intervals (ln RMSSD) increased significantly. Changes in standard deviations of the average NN intervals (SDANN) and ln RMSSD were significantly correlated to changes in peak VO(2) (R=0.47 and 0.39; p<0.01 and p=0.03 respectively). HRV measures were not significantly correlated to endothelial function. High-intensity exercise training over 6 months significantly improved time and frequency domain measures of HRV in patients following PCI with stent implantation. The effect on HRV was correlated to changes in peak VO(2), but not to changes in endothelial function.


Involvement of right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in ill-structured design cognition: an fMRI study.

The demography of food in health security: current experience with dairy consumption in Taiwan. To establish a food guide, the "total diet" needs to be considered, based on prevailing patterns of food and nutrient intake; these will be culturally acceptable and recognize the prevailing social and economic conditions that affect food availability. Dairy produce is a good source of high quality protein, and provides significant amounts of vitamins and minerals. People who consume more dairy have higher intakes of calcium and vitamin B2 with less chance of deficiency. We used four National Nutrition Surveys in Taiwan (NAHSITs) to establish the current demographic predictors of dairy intakes, an indicator of food security in an affluent society. There was a U shape relationship between dairy consumption practices (whether or not) and age. In Taiwanese, the practice is higher in school children (49.3%), adolescents (32.1%) and elderly (43.6%) than it is in middle age (22.2-25.9%). Average daily dairy intake decreases with age; in the elderly, the intake is less than half a serving. Forty seven percent of first grade children consumed a serving or more of dairy while the 6th graders dropped to 37%. Less than 20% adults consume one serving or more a day. The rate increases to 40% for elderly. Physiologic limitation and dietary habit account for 25% and 50% of dairy avoidance, respectively. Education, financial status, ethnicity, regionality and health seeking behaviors are determinants of dairy consumption in all age groups. There is a need for alternative Food Guides for non-dairy consumers. Attention to dairy intake for socio-economically disadvantaged groups is required.

Ending overly broad HIV criminalization: Canadian scientists and clinicians stand for justice. In Canada, people living with HIV who do not disclose their HIV status prior to sexual acts risk prosecution for aggravated sexual assault even if they have sex with a condom or while having a low (or undetectable) viral load, they had no intent to transmit HIV, and no transmission occurred. In 2013, six distinguished Canadian HIV scientists and clinicians took ground-breaking action to advance justice by co-authoring the "Canadian consensus statement on HIV and its transmission in the context of the criminal law." This effort was born out of the belief that the application of criminal law to HIV non-disclosure was being driven by a poor appreciation of the science of HIV. More than 75 HIV scientists and clinicians Canada-wide have now endorsed the statement, agreeing that "[they] have a professional and ethical responsibility to assist those in the criminal justice system to understand and interpret current medical and scientific evidence regarding HIV." As some 61 countries have adopted laws that specifically allow for HIV criminalization, and prosecutions for HIV non-disclosure, exposure and transmission have been reported in at least 49 countries, the authors hope that others around the world will take similar action. 

Plasma beta-carotene is not a suitable biomarker of fruit and vegetable intake in german subjects with a long-term high consumption of fruits and vegetables. beta-Carotene is often used as a marker for the amount of fruit and vegetables consumed, but little is known about plasma beta-carotene concentrations in subjects whose habitual (long-term) diets are characterized by different amounts of foods of plant origin. We compared dietary beta-carotene intake and plasma concentrations in women on habitual diets differing in the consumed amounts of foods of plant origin. A comparison of dietary beta-carotene intakes and plasma beta-carotene concentrations in women adhering to an average Western diet (n = 172), wholesome nutrition (following preventive recommendations) (n = 238) or a raw food diet (n = 104). Dietary beta-carotene intake was 5.5, 9.3, 14.7 mg/day for women adhering to an average Western diet, wholesome nutrition and raw food diet, respectively (p < 0.001). Corresponding multivariate adjusted plasma beta-carotene concentrations were 1.07, 1.65, and 1.16 micromol/l, respectively (p < 0.001). Comparable dietary beta-carotene intake resulted in lower multivariate adjusted plasma beta-carotene in women adhering to a raw food diet and average Western diet compared to those on wholesome nutrition (p < 0.001 for all intake groups up to 20 mg/day). The amount of fruit and vegetable intake did not predict plasma beta-carotene levels in women consuming a raw food diet. Plasma beta-carotene concentrations differed among the diet groups, with highest plasma levels in women adhering to wholesome nutrition. Plasma beta-carotene concentrations may not reflect beta-carotene intake and the amount of fruit and vegetables consumed.

Paclitaxel-induced arterial wall toxicity and inflammation: part 2--long-term tissue response in a minipig model. In part 1 of the present study, the authors demonstrated that coronary paclitaxel uptake from drug eluting stents (DESs) was not dependent on exposure time and dose. In this second part, the effect of the different paclitaxel dose densities on long-term biologic behavior was evaluated. In 40 minipigs, (with 4- and 12-week follow-up), identical stents with the same three paclitaxel dose densities as in part 1 were implanted in the right coronary artery. Minipigs implanted with Polyzene-F nanocoated stents served as the control group. Quantitative angiography measuring average luminal diameter (from three in-stent reference points), minimal luminal diameter (from the point of maximum in-stent stenosis), average late loss, maximum late loss, and binary stenosis rate was performed, as was microscopy to determine neointimal thickening, injury score, and inflammation. All three DESs were associated with a high average late loss, binary stenosis rate, and neointimal thickening, without significant differences. Drug-free stents had significantly less late in-stent stenosis: there was an average late loss of 0.3 mm +/- 0.3 in drug-free stents versus 0.8 mm +/- 0.2 in intermediate-dose stents and 1.5 mm +/- 0.6 in high-dose stents (P = .04). DES-associated inflammation was high in all DESs and six times higher as in the drug-free stents (Kornowski scores of 0.2 +/- 0.1 in drug-free stents, 1.3 +/- 0.9 in low-dose stents, 1.7 +/- 0.8 in intermediate-dose stents, and 1.3 +/- 1.0 in high-dose stents; P = .04). It worsened with time in all DESs, as did late in-stent stenosis. The extensive and long-term retention of paclitaxel even in a low-dose formulation, at least according to the present labeling of DESs, might be associated with negative long-term results with regard to inflammation and late in-stent stenosis.

Nicotine reduces the cytotoxic effect of glycated proteins on microglial cells. Protein glycation has been implicated to play an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease and other neurological disorders. Glycation induces extensive change in the structure of proteins and leads to the formation of cross beta-structures which are detected by the receptor of AGE. Activation of these receptors by glycated proteins transduces the signaling pathways which contribute to neuronal malfunctions and death. Glycated proteins can induce activation of microglia, which exacerbate the pathology of Alzheimer's disease by causing chronic inflammation. Compounds which can decelerate glycation or prevent the structural change of proteins during glycation should be of therapeutic interest. In this study the effect of nicotine on protein glycation and structural alterations of the glycated protein were investigated. Bovine serum albumin, as a model protein, was glycated by glucose in the presence or absence of nicotine and structural changes in the protein together with the effect of glycated proteins on the activation of microglia via receptor of AGE were studied. Nicotine not only could not prevent glycation, but even increased protein glycation. However, proteins glycated in the presence of nicotine did not form beta-structures. In the absence of this secondary structure glycated proteins cannot bind to the receptor of AGE on microglia. Here we showed that glycated proteins prepared in the presence of nicotine could not activate microglial cells.


Low-dose growth hormone supplementation increases clinical pregnancy rate in poor responders undergoing in vitro fertilisation.

Patient safety attitudes of paediatric trainee physicians. To measure the patient safety attitudes of trainee physicians at an academic paediatric hospital. Cross-sectional survey. An academic paediatric hospital. 209 trainee physicians based at the academic paediatric hospital in January 2004. Patient safety attitudes of trainee physicians measured using the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (Inpatient Version) and a specific trainee survey. In the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire, responses were most positive in areas associated with independent care: job satisfaction (mean factor score = 77.5) safety climate (76.1), working conditions (75.6), perception of management (70.4) and less positively in areas associated with interdependent care: teamwork climate (64.6) and stress recognition (59.1). In the trainee survey, following a principal component analysis to identify summary factors, responses were most positive in the independent areas of clinical supervision and support (75.0), communication with their immediate senior physician (65.5) and orientation of new personnel (63.9), and less positive in the interdependent areas of handoffs and multiple services, (58.1), role identification during codes (51.0) and support following an adverse event (42.8). The combined independent factor scores were higher than the interdependent (difference = 17.9, 95% CI 16.1 to 19.7, p<0.001). Fellows reported higher independent factor scores than residents (5.5, 95% CI 2.2 to 8.9, p = 0.001), but not for the interdependent scores (-0.5, 95% CI -3.6 to 2.7, p = 0.767). Trainees appear comfortable with caring independently for patients but less so caring interdependently. With experience, trainee physicians may experience improvement in their ability to act independently but not interdependently. Recently developed patient safety culture instruments may enable additional understanding of what could be implemented to make improvements.

Impact of anti-angiogenic treatments on metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Patients with metastatic renal cell cancer (mRCC) have traditionally had poor responses to systemic therapies. Recent developments in molecular biology have increased our understanding of the oncogenic processes and pathways in clear-cell mRCC. The development of drugs that target these pathways has expanded treatment options, improved prognosis and changed standard management of patients with clear-cell mRCC. Sunitinib, sorafenib and pazopanib (oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors) as well as everolimus and temsirolimus (mTOR inhibitors) and interferon with bevacizumab (an antibody to VEGF) have improved patient outcomes in large Phase III trials. These drugs have been incorporated into standard practice. Sunitinib has been adopted as first-line standard of care. Many agents are in development for treatment of mRCC, including axitinib in Phase III trials. We will review these treatments, their toxicities and how these targeted agents have impacted on mRCC.


Development of a bionanotechnological phosphate removal system with thermostable ferritin.

Human sickle cell blood modulates endothelial heme oxygenase activity: effects on vascular adhesion and reactivity. Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by extensive hemolysis, increased cellular adhesion, and vaso-occlusion. Tissues from sickle patients express heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), the enzyme that degrades free heme/hemoglobin to the signaling molecule carbon monoxide, and the antioxidants biliverdin/bilirubin. Here, we examined the HO response in endothelial cells exposed to human sickle blood and determined whether this response is beneficial for SCD. We measured HO activity in human and bovine aortic endothelial cells incubated with human sickle or normal blood. Sickle blood increased HO activity, which was enhanced by hypoxia and was caused mainly by the red cell components of sickle blood. Oxidized hemoglobin was higher in sickle blood and increased markedly over time. Interestingly, HO activity correlated inversely with patients' hemoglobin levels and positively with bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase. HO-1 induction, exogenous biliverdin, or carbon monoxide markedly decreased adhesion of sickle blood to the endothelium, and sickle red cells partially inhibited relaxation mediated by carbon monoxide in isolated aortas. Our results highlight important associations between SCD and HO byproducts, which may counteract vascular complications of SCD.

In vitro adsorption of gentamicin and netilmicin by polyacrylonitrile and polyamide hemofiltration filters. Adsorption of gentamicin and netilmicin by new polyacrylonitrile and polyamide hemofiltration filters was studied over 4 h, using a single-compartment in vitro continuous venovenous hemofiltration model. After the first dose (16.6 mg of gentamicin, 19.3 mg of netilmicin), 14.9 mg of gentamicin and 19.2 mg of netilmicin were adsorbed to polyacrylonitrile filters in vitro. Adsorption by polyacrylonitrile filters was rapid and irreversible and could be increased by repeated dosing. Adsorption by polyamide filters was substantially less.

Mid-term clinical outcomes in cardiac surgery of Jehovah's witnesses. Surgical treatment of Jehovah's witnesses is a special challenge for cardiac surgery. The purpose of this study was to evaluate perioperative management and mid-term clinical outcome of Jehovah's witnesses who underwent cardiac surgery. Between January 1990 and June 2009, 34 Jehovah's witnesses (22 men, mean age 66 +/- 8 years) underwent cardiac surgery. Surgical procedures included 17 coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG): 3 CABG and aortic valve replacements (AVR); 1 CABG and mitral valve plasty (MVP); 6 AVR; 1 subaortic membrane resection; 2 mitral valve replacements (MVR) and 2 MVP; 1 mitro-aortic valve replacement; and 1 cardiac foreign body removal. There were four urgent operations; 14 patients had NYHA class II-III. Sixteen patients received erythropoietin preoperatively. Preoperative haemoglobin (Hb) value was 14.2 +/- 1.4 g/dl. Extracorporeal circulation time was 127 +/- 66 min, aortic cross-clamping 84 +/- 45 min. Haemoglobin value 24 h after surgery was 11.2 +/- 1.7 g/dl, haematocrit 34.1 +/- 5.2%. None required surgical reoperation for bleeding.Intensive care unit stay was 2.3 +/- 4.3 days, hospital stay 12.3 +/- 10.4 days; there was no hospital mortality. Postoperatively, erythropoietin was administered to 19 patients. Follow-up was completed in 100%. Reoperation was necessary 8 years later in one patient for mitral bioprosthesis degeneration; the patient died 8 months later. All other patients are alive 59 +/- 60 months after surgery; actuarial survival is 100% and 80 +/- 2% at 5 and 10 years, respectively. In our limited experience, early and late surgical results of Jehovah's witnesses patients are satisfactory. Appropriate preoperative management, optimization of Hb values, intraoperative measures to reduce the risk of bleeding and total blood loss recovery are the goals to achieve these results.

Electroporation and ultrasound enhanced non-viral gene delivery in vitro and in vivo. Non-viral vectors are less efficient than the use of viral vectors for delivery of genetic material to cells in vitro and especially in vivo. However, viral vectors involve the use of foreign proteins that can stimulate both the innate and acquired immune response. In contrast, plasmid DNA can be delivered without carrier proteins and is non-immunogenic. Plasmid gene delivery can be enhanced by the use of physical methods that aid the passage of the plasmid through the cell membrane. Electroporation and microbubble-enhanced ultrasound are two of the most effective physical delivery methods and these can be applied to a range of different cell types in vitro and a broad range of tissues in vivo. Both techniques also have the advantage that, unlike viral vectors, they can be used to target specific tissues with systemic delivery. Although electroporation is often the more efficient of the two, microbubble-enhanced ultrasound causes less damage and is less invasive. This review provides an introduction to the methodology and summarises the range of cells and tissues that have been genetically modified using these techniques.

Using spectroscopic and microscopic methods to probe the structural stability of human adenovirus type 4. Adenovirus serotype 4 (Ad4) is a major cause of Ad-associated human diseases. Ad4 is also considered to be a potential delivery vector for gene therapy. In this study, multiple spectroscopic techniques together with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were employed to probe viral stability and to improve pharmaceutical formulations of Ad4-based vaccines and DNA carriers. Perturbations of secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure of Ad4 proteins induced by elevated temperatures over a wide pH range (3-8) were analyzed using circular dichroism, UV absorption and intrinsic and extrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy as well as static and dynamic light scattering. The spectroscopic results obtained indicate a decrease in Ad4 stability as pH increases from 4 to 8, similar to the behavior reported previously for Ad2 and Ad5, although the Ad4 virion appears to possess slightly more tolerance to thermal stress. An empirical phase diagram (EPD) approach was used to summarize the data in the form of a colored map. In addition, the different physical states of Ad4 identified by the EPD were confirmed by TEM images. The results obtained in this study reveal both structural similarities among three commonly employed Ad subtypes (2, 4 and 5) as well as unique properties of Ad4.

Physiotherapy alone or in combination with corticosteroid injection for acute lateral epicondylitis in general practice: a protocol for a randomised, placebo-controlled study. Lateral epicondylitis is a painful condition responsible for loss of function and sick leave for long periods of time. In many countries, the treatment guidelines recommend a wait-and-see policy, reflecting that no conclusions on the best treatment can be drawn from the available research, published studies and meta-analyses. Randomized double blind controlled clinical trial in a primary care setting. While earlier trials have either compared corticosteroid injections to physical therapy or to naproxen orally, we will compare the clinical effect of physiotherapy alone or physiotherapy combined with corticosteroid injection in the initial treatment of acute tennis elbow. Patients seeing their general practitioner with lateral elbow pain of recent onset will be randomised to one of three interventions: 1: physiotherapy, corticosteroid injection and naproxen or 2: physiotherapy, placebo injection and naproxen or 3: wait and see treatment with naproxen alone. Treatment and assessments are done by two different doctors, and the contents of the injection is unknown to both the treating doctor and patient. The primary outcome measure is the patient's evaluation of improvement after 6, 12, 26 and 52 weeks. Secondary outcome measures are pain, function and severity of main complaint, pain-free grip strength, maximal grip strength, pressure-pain threshold, the patient's satisfaction with the treatment and duration of sick leave. This article describes a randomized, double blind, controlled clinical trial with a one year follow up to investigate the effects of adding steroid injections to physiotherapy in acute lateral epicondylitis.

Ophthalmic pathology of Nance-Horan syndrome: case report and review of the literature. Nance-Horan syndrome (NHS) is a rare X-linked disorder typified by dense congenital central cataracts, microcornea, anteverted and simplex pinnae, brachymetacarpalia, and numerous dental anomalies due in most cases to a mutation in the NHS gene. We present a case of clinical manifestation and ocular pathology in a patient with NHS. This article also reviews and discusses the relevant literature. Classic and novel ocular pathological findings of a young male with NHS are described, including congenital cataracts, infantile glaucoma, scleral staphyloma, and severe retinal cystoid degeneration. We report a new pathological finding of severe retinal cystoid degeneration in this NHS patient and confirm abnormal development of the anterior chamber angle structure. These findings, coupled with our analysis of the available NHS literature, provide new understanding of the histopathological basis of ocular abnormalities and vision loss in NHS.

Increased resting-state functional connectivity of visual- and cognitive-control brain networks after training in children with reading difficulties. The Reading Acceleration Program, a computerized reading-training program, increases activation in neural circuits related to reading. We examined the effect of the training on the functional connectivity between independent components related to visual processing, executive functions, attention, memory, and language during rest after the training. Children 8-12Â years old with reading difficulties and typical readers participated in the study. Behavioral testing and functional magnetic resonance imaging were performed before and after the training. Imaging data were analyzed using an independent component analysis approach. After training, both reading groups showed increased single-word contextual reading and reading comprehension scores. Greater positive correlations between the visual-processing component and the executive functions, attention, memory, or language components were found after training in children with reading difficulties. Training-related increases in connectivity between the visual and attention components and between the visual and executive function components were positively correlated with increased word reading and reading comprehension, respectively. Our findings suggest that the effect of the Reading Acceleration Program on basic cognitive domains can be detected even in the absence of an ongoing reading task. 

[Karyotype analysis of chorionic villi from pregnant women with missed abortion using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification]. To evaluate the clinical value of multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) technique used in karyotype analysis of chorionic villi from missed abortion. Feb 2008 to Oct 2008, 91 patients with missed abortion diagnosed by hormonal measurement, type B ultrasound and physical exam matched with 20 normal pregnant women undergoing artificial abortion were enrolled in this study. Chorionic villi was obtained by suction dilation and curettage in aseptic condition, then those villi was cultured and analyzed by traditional cytogenetic karyotyping method, in the mean time, the DNA extracted from villi was detected by MLPA. The results of chromosomal G-banding of chorionic villi were compared between two methods. The diagnostic concordance of MLPA and traditional karyotyping was observed in 92% (84/91) cases, there were 84 cases in the case group with diagnostic concordance by traditional karyotyping and MLPA except 7 cases of euploidy could not be detected by MLPA. The 84 cases included 40 normal karyotype, 29 trisomy of euchromosome, 1 double trisomy of euchromosome, 10 monosomy X, 1 monosomy X combined with trisomy of euchromosome, 2 chimaera of X chromosome, 1 structural abnormity of euchromosome. Among 7 cases with discordance diagnosis, 2 cases with trisomy and 5 cases with tetrasomy of euchromosome were identified in traditional karyotyping, however, they were all diagnosed with normal disomy by MLPA. Of 20 villi from normal pregnancy, two methods got the consistent results. The MLPA was rapid and efficacy method used for analyzing aneuploids in chorionic villi.

Restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategy for red blood cell transfusion in critically ill patients and in patients with acute coronary syndrome: a systematic review, meta-analysis and trial sequential analysis. The risks and benefits of transfusing critically ill patients continue to evoke controversy. Specifically, the critically ill patients with active ischemic cardiac disease continue to represent a "gray area" in the literature. Meta-analysis of the effects of lower versus higher hemoglobin thresholds on mortality in critically ill patients was carried out using PRISMA methodology. A systematic research was performed in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (last update, December 2014). Anemic critically ill adult patients admitted to intensive care units and/or anemic patients with acute coronary syndrome in which a restrictive vs. liberal transfusion therapy was compared. mortality. Included studies were subjected to quantifiable analysis, predefined subgroup analysis, trial sequential analysis and predefined sensitivity analysis. Thirty RCT's were initially identified; 6 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, including 2156. There were no differences in mortality between the restrictive and liberal groups (RR: 0.86, 95% CI 0.70-1.05 P=0.14), neither in patients with chronic cardiovascular disease subgroup (RR: 1.13, 95% IC 0.88-1.46 P=0.34). However, there is a trend towards decreased mortality in the subgroup critically ill (RR: 0.86, 95% CI 0.73-1.01 P=0.06); while in the subgroup of patients with acute myocardial infarct seems like it might be a non-significant trend towards increased mortality (RR: 3.85, 95% CI 0.82-18.0 P=0.09). Restrictive strategy is at least as effective to liberal strategy in critically ill patients. Nevertheless, there is insufficient evidence to recommend a restrictive strategy for patients with acute coronary syndrome.

Active Treatment for Idiopathic Adolescent Scoliosis (ACTIvATeS): a feasibility study. The feasibility of conducting a definitive randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of scoliosis-specific exercises (SSEs) for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is uncertain. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility of conducting a large, multicentre trial of SSE treatment for patients with AIS, in comparison with standard care, and to refine elements of the study design. The objectives were to (1) update a systematic review of controlled trials evaluating the efficacy of SSE in AIS; (2) survey UK orthopaedic surgeons and physiotherapists to determine current practice, patient populations and equipoise; (3) randomise 50 adolescents to a feasibility trial of either usual care or SSE interventions across a range of sites; (4) develop, document and assess acceptability and adherence of interventions; (5) assess and describe training requirements of physiotherapists; and (6) gain user input in all relevant stages of treatment and protocol design. Multicomponent feasibility study including UK clinician survey, systematic literature review and a randomised feasibility trial. The randomised feasibility study involved four secondary care NHS trusts providing specialist care for patients with AIS. The randomised feasibility study recruited people aged 10-16 years with mild AIS (Cobb angle of <â50Â°). The randomised study allocated participants to standard practice of advice and education or a physiotherapy SSE programme supported by a home exercise plan. Our choice of intervention was informed by a systematic review of exercise interventions for AIS. The main outcome was feasibility of recruitment to the randomised study. Other elements were to inform choice of outcomes for a definitive trial and included curve severity, quality of life, requirement for surgery/brace, adverse events, psychological symptoms, costs and health utilities. A UK survey of orthopaedic consultants and physiotherapists indicated a wide variation in current provision of exercise therapy through physiotherapy services. It also found that clinicians from at least 15 centres would be willing to have their patients involved in a full study. A systematic review update found five new studies that were generally of low quality but showed some promise of effectiveness of SSE. The randomised study recruited 58 patients from four NHS trusts over 11 months and exceeded the pre-specified target recruitment rate of 1.4 participants per centre per month, with acceptable 6-month follow-up (currently 73%). Adherence to treatment was variable (56% of participants completed treatment offered). The qualitative study found the exercise programme to be highly acceptable. We learnt important lessons from patient and public involvement during the study in terms of study and intervention presentation, as well as practical elements such as scheduling of intervention sessions. A definitive RCT evaluating clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of SSE for idiopathic scoliosis is warranted and feasible. Such a RCT is a priority for future work in the area. There is a sufficiently large patient base, combined with willingness to be randomised within specialist UK centres. Interventions developed during the feasibility study were acceptable to patients, families and physiotherapists and can be given within the affordability envelope of current levels of physiotherapy commissioning.

Flexor tendon tissue engineering: temporal distribution of donor tenocytes versus recipient cells. Tissue-engineered tendon material may address tendon shortages in mutilating hand injuries. Tenocytes from rabbit flexor tendon can be successfully seeded onto acellularized tendons that are used as tendon constructs. These constructs in vivo exhibit a population of tenocyte-like cells; however, it is not known to what extent these cells are of donor or recipient origin. Furthermore, the temporal distribution is also not known. Tenocytes from New Zealand male rabbits were cultured and seeded onto acellularized rabbit forepaw flexor tendons (n = 48). These tendon constructs were transplanted into female recipients. Tendons were examined after 3, 6, 12, and 30 weeks using fluorescent in situ hybridization to detect the Y chromosome in the male donor cells. One unseeded, acellularized allograft in each animal was used as a control. The donor male tenocytes populate the epitenon and endotenon of the grafts at greater numbers than the recipient female tenocytes at 3 and 6 weeks. The donor and recipient tenocytes are present jointly in the grafts until 12 weeks. At 30 weeks, nearly all cells are recipient tenocyte-like cells. Donor male cells survive in decreasing numbers over time until 30 weeks. The presence of cells in tissue-engineered tendon grafts has been shown in prior studies to add to the strength of the constructs in vitro. This study shows that recipient cells can migrate into and repopulate the tendon construct. Cell seeding onto tendon material may create stronger constructs that will allow the initiation of motion earlier.

Binary mixed micelles of chiral sodium undecenyl leucinate and achiral sodium undecenyl sulfate: I. Characterization and application as pseudostationary phases in micellar electrokinetic chromatography. Sodium 10-undecenyl sulfate (SUS), sodium 10-undecenyl leucinate (SUL) and their five different mixed micelles at varied percent mole ratios were prepared. The critical micelle concentration (CMC), C(20), gamma(CMC), partial specific volume, methylene group selectivity, mobilities and elution window were determined using a variety of analytical techniques. These surfactant systems were then evaluated as novel pseudostationary phases in micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). As a commonly used pseudostationary phase in MEKC, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) was also evaluated. The CMC values of SUS and SUL were found to be 26 and 16 mM, respectively, whereas the CMC of mixed surfactants was found to be very similar to that of SUL. The C(20) values decreased dramatically as the concentration of SUL is increased in the mixed micelle. An increase in SUL content gradually increased the methylene group selectivity making the binary mixed surfactants more hydrophobic. Linear solvation energy relationships (LSERs) and free energy of transfer studies were also applied to predict the selectivity differences between the surfactant systems. The cohesiveness and the hydrogen bond acidic character of the surfactant systems were found to have the most significant influence on selectivity and MEKC retention. The SUS and SDS showed the strongest while SUL showed the weakest hydrogen bond donating capacity. The basicity, interaction with n and pi-electrons of the solute and dipolarity/polarizability were the least significant factors in LSER model for the surfactant systems studied. Free energies of transfer of selected functional groups in each surfactant systems were also calculated and found to be in good agreement with the LSER data.


Multi-scale recordings for neuroprosthetic control of finger movements.

RACK1 is involved in Î²-amyloid impairment of muscarinic regulation of GABAergic transmission. RACK1 (receptor for activated C-kinase 1), an anchoring protein that shuttles activated PKC to cellular membranes, plays an important role in PKC-mediated signal transduction pathways. A significant loss of RACK1 has been found in the brain of aging animals and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, which implicates the potential involvement of RACK1 in altered PKC activation associated with dementia. Our previous studies have demonstrated that GABAergic inhibition in prefrontal cortex, which is important for cognitive processes like "working memory", is regulated by muscarinic receptors via a PKC-dependent mechanism, and this effect is impaired by Î²-amyloid peptide (AÎ²). In this study, we found that AÎ² oligomers decreased RACK1 distribution in the membrane fraction of cortical neurons. Moreover, overexpression of RACK1 rescued the effect of muscarinic receptors on GABAergic transmission in AÎ²-treated cortical cultures in vitro and AÎ²-injected cortical neurons in vivo. These results suggest that the AÎ²-induced loss of RACK1 distribution in the cell membrane may underlie the AÎ² impairment of muscarinic regulation of PKC and GABAergic transmission. Thus, RACK1 provides a potential therapeutic target that can restore some of the impaired cellular processes by AÎ².

CO2 as a carbon neutral fuel source via enhanced biomass gasification. The gas evolution, mass decay behavior and energy content of several woods, grasses, and agricultural residues were examined with steam and CO(2) gasification using thermogravimetric analysis and gas chromatography. CO(2) concentrations were varied between 0 and 100% with steam as a coreactant. Carbon conversion was complete with 25% CO(2)/75% steam compared to 90% conversion with pure steam in the temperature range of 800-1000 degrees C. The largest effect was from 0-5% CO(2) introduction where CO concentration increased by a factor of 10 and H(2) decreased by a factor of 3.3 at 900 degrees C. Increasing CO(2) from 5 to 50% resulted in continued CO increases and H(2) decrease by a factor of 3 at 900 degrees C. This yielded a H(2)/CO ratio that could be adjusted from 5.5 at a 0% CO(2) to 0.25 at a 50% CO(2) concentration. Selection of the gasification parameters, such as heating rate, also enabled greater control in the separation of cellulose from lignin via thermal treatment. 100% CO(2) concentration enabled near complete separation of cellulose from lignin at 380 degrees C using a 1 degrees C min(-1) heating rate. Similar trends were observed with coal and municipal solid waste (MSW) as feedstock. The likely mechanism is the ability for CO(2) to enhance the pore structure, particularly the micropores, of the residual carbon skeleton after drying and devolatilization providing access for CO(2) to efficiently gasify the solid.

Detection of sub-clinical CWD infection in conventional test-negative deer long after oral exposure to urine and feces from CWD+ deer. Chronic wasting disease (CWD) of cervids is a prion disease distinguished by high levels of transmissibility, wherein bodily fluids and excretions are thought to play an important role. Using cervid bioassay and established CWD detection methods, we have previously identified infectious prions in saliva and blood but not urine or feces of CWD+ donors. More recently, we identified very low concentrations of CWD prions in urine of deer by cervid PrP transgenic (Tg[CerPrP]) mouse bioassay and serial protein misfolding cyclic amplification (sPMCA). This finding led us to examine further our initial cervid bioassay experiments using sPMCA. We sought to investigate whether conventional test-negative deer, previously exposed orally to urine and feces from CWD+ sources, may be harboring low level CWD infection not evident in the 19 month observation period. We further attempted to determine the peripheral PrP(CWD) distribution in these animals. Various neural and lymphoid tissues from conventional test-negative deer were reanalyzed for CWD prions by sPMCA and cervid transgenic mouse bioassay in parallel with appropriate tissue-matched positive and negative controls. PrP(CWD) was detected in the tissues of orally exposed deer by both sPMCA and Tg[CerPrP] mouse bioassay; each assay revealed very low levels of CWD prions previously undetectable by western blot, ELISA, or IHC. Serial PMCA analysis of individual tissues identified that obex alone was positive in 4 of 5 urine/feces exposed deer. PrP(CWD) was amplified from both lymphoid and neural tissues of positive control deer but not from identical tissues of negative control deer. Detection of subclinical infection in deer orally exposed to urine and feces (1) suggests that a prolonged subclinical state can exist, necessitating observation periods in excess of two years to detect CWD infection, and (2) illustrates the sensitive and specific application of sPMCA in the diagnosis of low-level prion infection. Based on these results, it is possible that low doses of prions, e.g. following oral exposure to urine and saliva of CWD-infected deer, bypass significant amplification in the LRS, perhaps utilizing a neural conduit between the alimentary tract and CNS, as has been demonstrated in some other prion diseases.

Metabonomic phenotype and identification of "heart blood stasis obstruction pattern" and "qi and yin deficiency pattern" of myocardial ischemia rat models. The traditional Chinese medicine concepts of "Xinxueyuzuzheng (heart blood stasis obstruction pattern)" and "Qiyinliangxuzheng (qi and yin deficiency pattern)" for myocardial ischemia rat models were constructed in the present study. Endogenous metabolites in rat plasma were analyzed using the GC/TOF-MS-based metabonomic method. Significant metabolic differences were observed between the control and two model groups, and the three groups were distinguished clearly by pattern recognition. Compared with those of the control, the levels of hydroxyproline, threonic acid, glutamine and citric acid were strikingly up- or down-regulated in model rats. The metabolites contributing most to the classification between the two "pattern" rats were identified, such as valine, serine, threonine, ornithine, hydroxyproline, lysine, 2-hydroxybutanoic acid, 3-hydroxybutanoic acid, galactofuranose and inositol. These compounds were indicated as the potential biomarkers. The results suggested that the two "patterns" are involved in dysfunction in oxidative stress, energy metabolism and amino acid metabolism. These findings also provided the substantial foundation for exploring the scientific connotation of these two "Zhengxing (pattern types)" of myocardial ischemia, and "Bianzheng (pattern identification)".

[Molecular epidemiological analysis of class I Newcastle disease virus isolated from China in 2008]. Thirteen isolates of Class I Newcastle disease virus obtained from healthy poultry in China during 2008 were characterized genotypically in this study. All the isolates were proved to be lentogenic strains based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the Fusion protein gene. Molecular epidemiological analysis showed that 13 isolates could be subdivided into 2 distinct genotypes, 11 isolates belonged to genotype 2, and other 2 isolates belonged to genotype 3. Results indicated two genotypes of Class I Newcastle disease virus might widely exist in domestic poultry in China.

[AA-type amyloidosis secondary to multidrug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis: implications for therapy]. Multidrug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis was diagnosed to a 32-year-old man. An AA-amyloidosis was subsequently diagnosed on the renal biopsy performed for nephrotic syndrome and macroscopic hematuria. A 6-drug antibiotic treatment was delivered quickly after first results of genotypic antibiogram given the renal failure, and was secondarily adapted to the phenotypic antibiogram. Multidrug therapy was fairly well tolerated. Clinical and biological improving were slow. Although tuberculosis is a classic cause of amyloidosis, this is the first case reporting an association between a multidrug resistant case and an amyloidosis in adults. This case also raises the question of MDR probabilistic treatments in situations whether a vital organ prognosis is engaged.

Hydrogen/Deuterium Exchange and Molecular Dynamics Analysis of Amyloid Fibrils Formed by a D69K Charge-Pair Mutant of Human Apolipoprotein C-II. Plasma apolipoproteins form amphipathic Î± helices in lipid environments but in the lipid-free state show a high propensity to form Î² structure and self-associate into amyloid fibrils. The widespread occurrence of apolipoproteins in amyloid plaques suggests disease-related roles, specifically in atherosclerosis. To reconcile the dual abilities of apolipoproteins to form either Î± helices or cross-Î² sheet structures, we examined fibrils formed by human apolipoprotein C-II (apoC-II). A structural model for apoC-II fibrils shows a cross-Î² core with parallel Î² strands, including a buried K30-D69 charge pair. We investigated the effect of abolishing this charge pair in mutant D69K apoC-II. Fluorescence studies indicated more rapid fibril formation and less solvent accessibility of tryptophan (W26) in D69K apoC-II fibrils than in wild-type (WT) fibrils. X-ray diffraction data of aligned D69K apoC-II fibrils yielded a typical cross-Î² structure with increased Î² sheet spacing compared to that of WT fibrils. Hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange patterns were similar for D69K apoC-II fibrils compared to WT fibrils, albeit with an overall reduction in the level of slow H/D exchange, particularly around residues 29-32. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated reduced Î² strand content for a model D69K apoC-II tetramer compared to the WT tetramer and confirmed an expansion of the cross-Î² spacing that contributed to the formation of a stable charge pair between K69 and E27. The results highlight the importance of charge-pair interactions within the apoC-II fibril core, which together with numerous salt bridges in the flexible connecting loop play a major role in the ability of lipid-free apoC-II to form stable cross-Î² fibrils.

[Significance of heterogenity in endothelium-dependent vasodilatation occurrence in healthy individuals with or without coronary risk factors]. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is extensively used for non-invasive assessment of endothelial function. Traditionally, FMD is calculated as a percent change of arterial diameter from the baseline value at an arbitrary time point after cuff deflation (usually 60 seconds). Considerable individual differences in brachial artery temporal response to hyperemic stimulus have been observed, potentially influenced by the presence of atherosclerotic risk factors (RF). The importance of such differences for the evaluation of endothelial function has not been well established. The aim of the study was to determine the time course of maximal brachial artery endothelium-dependent dilation in healthy adults with and without RF, to explore the correlation of RF with brachial artery temporal response and to evaluate the importance of individual differences in temporal response for the assessment of endothelial function. A total of 115 healthy volunteers were included in the study. Out of them, 58 had no RF (26 men, mean age 44 +/-14 years) and 57 had at least one RF (29 men, mean age 45 +/-14 years). High-resolution color Doppler vascular ultrasound was used for brachial artery imaging. To determine maximal arterial diameter after cuff deflation and the time-point of maximal vasodilation off-line sequential measurements were performed every 10 seconds from 0 to 240 seconds after cuff release. True maximal FMD value was calculated as a percent change of the true maximal diameter from the baseline, and compared with FMD value calculated assuming that every participant reached maximal dilation at 60 seconds post cuff deflation (FMD60). Correlation of different RF with brachial artery temporal response was assessed. A maximal brachial artery endothelium-dependent vasodilation occurred from 30-120 seconds after cuff release, and the mean time of endothelium-dependent dilation was 68 +/-20 seconds. Individuals without RF had faster endothelium-dependent dilation (mean time 62 +/-17 seconds), and a shorter time-span (30 to 100 seconds), than participants with RF (mean time 75 +/-21 seconds, time-span 40 to 120 seconds) (p < 0.001). Time when the maximal endothelium-dependent dilation occurred was independently associated with age, serum lipid fractions (total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol), smoking, physical activity and C-reactive protein. True maximal FMD value in the whole group (6.7 +/-3.0%) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than FMD60 (5.2 +/-3.5%). The same results were demonstrated for individuals with RF (4.9 +/- 1.7% vs 3.1 +/- 2.3%, p < 0.001) and without RF (8.4 +/- 2.9% vs 7.2 +/- 3.2%, p < 0.05). The temporal response of endothelium-dependent dilation is influenced by the presence of coronary FR and individually heterogeneous. When calculated according to the commonly used approach, i.e. 60 seconds after cuff deflation, FMD is significantly lower than the true maximal FMD. The routinely used measurement time-points for FMD assessment may not be adequate for the detection of true peak vasodilation in individual persons. More precise evaluation of endothelial function can be achieved with sequential measurement of arterial diameter after hyperemic stimulus.


Effect of high dose vitamin D intake on interleukin-17 levels in multiple sclerosis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial.

The ins and outs of adrenergic signaling. Adrenergic signaling, in particular signaling in the sympathetic nervous system, is a prime example of the control of an essential physiological system. It has served as a model system both for the control of mediator release and for receptor signaling and regulation. This review covers the historical development of the field and then addresses issues that represent key fields of ongoing research: the mechanisms and kinetics of receptor activation, temporal patterns of downstream signaling and signal bias, receptor mobility and aggregation, and signal compartmentation and specificity. The available evidence suggests that adrenergic signaling may involve complex spatiotemporal patterns, which give texture to the signaling process and may contain additional biological information. 

Injury severity score, resource use, and outcome for trauma patients within a Japanese administrative database. Injury Severity Score (ISS) is commonly used in prediction models and risk adjustment for mortality. However, few studies have assessed the relationship of ISS to outcomes such as resource use. To test the utility of ISS for investigation of the quality of trauma care, we evaluated the impact of ISS on resource utilization and mortality. Of 1,895,249 cases from a Japanese administrative database in 2006, 13,627 trauma patients with ISS were analyzed. Variables included demographics, ISS, number and locations of injured organs, comorbidities, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures recorded during hospitalization, and hospital type. Dependent variables were length of stay (LOS), total charges (TC), initial 48-hour TC, high outliers of LOS or TC, and mortality. Multivariate analyses were used to measure the impact of ISS. ISS 1 to 9 was most frequent (85.5%) and blunt injury occurred in 93.7% of patients. With increasing ISS, the mortality rate rose to 27.2% at ISS >or=36. LOS was higher at ISS >or=36 whereas TC was higher at 25 to 35. After controlling for study variables, rehabilitation was most strongly associated with LOS, TC, and LOS outliers. ISS 25 to 35 affected initial 48-hour TC most, while ventilation affected mortality most. "Abdomen, pelvic organs" and ISS 25 to 35 or >or=36 were more strongly associated with outcomes. Specific ISS and injured organs may be used to estimate resource use or mortality for monitoring quality of trauma care. To integrate a more efficient system of trauma care, variations in resource input among hospitals should be investigated.

Data mining of patients on weaning trials from mechanical ventilation using cluster analysis and neural networks. The process of weaning from mechanical ventilation is one of the challenges in intensive care. 149 patients under extubation process (T-tube test) were studied: 88 patients with successful trials (group S), 38 patients who failed to maintain spontaneous breathing and were reconnected (group F), and 23 patients with successful test but that had to be reintubated before 48 hours (group R). Each patient was characterized using 8 time series and 6 statistics extracted from respiratory and cardiac signals. A moving window statistical analysis was applied obtaining for each patient a sequence of patterns of 48 features. Applying a cluster analysis two groups with the majority dataset were obtained. Neural networks were applied to discriminate between patients from groups S, F and R. The best performance obtained was 84.0% of well classified patients using a linear perceptron trained with a feature selection procedure (that selected 19 of the 48 features) and taking as input the main cluster centroid. However, the classification baseline 69.8% could not be improved when using the original set of patterns instead of the centroids to classify the patients.

Expression of a glycosylated GFP as a bivalent reporter in exocytosis. The complex-type N-linked glycans of plants differ markedly in structure from those of animals. Like those of insects and mollusks they lack terminal sialic acid(s) and may contain an alpha-(1,3)-fucose (Fuc) linked to the proximal GlcNAc residue and/or a beta-(1,2)-xylose (Xyl) residue attached to the proximal mannose (Man) of the glycan core. N-glycosylated GFPs were used in previous studies showing their effective use to report on membrane traffic between the ER and the Golgi apparatus in plant cells. In all these cases glycosylated tags were added at the GFP termini. Because of the position of the tag and depending on the sorting and accumulation site of these modified GFP, there is always a risk of processing and degradation, and this protein design cannot be considered ideal. Here, we describe the development of three different GFPs in which the glycosylation site is internally localized at positions 80, 133, or 172 in the internal sequence. The best glycosylation site was at position 133. This glycosylated GFPgl133 appears to be protected from undesired processing of the glycosylation site and represents a bivalent reporter for biochemical and microscopic studies. After experimental validation, we can conclude that amino acid 133 is an effective glycosylation site and that the GFPgl133 is a powerful tool for in vivo investigations in plant cell biology.

An update on dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans to measure bone mineral density at the spine and hip have an important role in the evaluation of individuals at risk of osteoporosis, and in helping clinicians advise patients about the appropriate use of antifracture treatment. Compared with alternative bone densitometry techniques, hip and spine DXA examinations have several advantages that include a consensus that bone mineral density results should be interpreted using the World Health Organization T score definition of osteoporosis, a proven ability to predict fracture risk, proven effectiveness at targeting antifracture therapies, and the ability to monitor response to treatment. This review discusses the evidence for these and other clinical aspects of DXA scanning. Particular attention is directed at the new World Health Organization Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) algorithm, which uses clinical risk factors in addition to a hip DXA scan to predict a patient's 10-year probability of suffering an osteoporotic fracture. We also discuss the recently published clinical guidelines that incorporate the FRAX fracture risk assessment in decisions about patient treatment.

Isolation and characterization of primary microglia from post-natal murine brain tissues: a comparison of two methods. Microglia are resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS). Apart from playing vital roles as sentinel cells, they are crucial in physiological processes such as synaptic pruning during brain development. CNS disorders require an understanding of the contribution of each cellular compartment to the pathogenesis. Elucidating the role of microglia in disease development and progression in the intricate CNS environment is technically challenging and requires the establishment of reliable, reproducible techniques to isolate and culture microglia. A number of different protocols have been developed for isolation of neonatal microglia and here we compare two widely used methods, namely, mild trypsinization and EasySepÂ® magnetic separation. EasySepÂ® magnetic separation provided higher microglia yield, and flow cytometric evaluation of CD11b and F4/80 markers revealed that EasySepÂ® separation method also produced significantly higher purity compared to mild trypsinization. Microglia isolated using EasySepÂ® separation method were functional, as demonstrated by the generation of nitric oxide, IL-6, TNF-Î±, and MCP-1 in response to lipopolysaccharide stimulation. In summary, this study has revealed that magnetic separation is superior to mild trypsinization in terms of yield and purity of microglia. 

Symbiotic nitrogen fixation in the fungus gardens of leaf-cutter ants. Bacteria-mediated acquisition of atmospheric N2 serves as a critical source of nitrogen in terrestrial ecosystems. Here we reveal that symbiotic nitrogen fixation facilitates the cultivation of specialized fungal crops by leaf-cutter ants. By using acetylene reduction and stable isotope experiments, we demonstrated that N2 fixation occurred in the fungus gardens of eight leaf-cutter ant species and, further, that this fixed nitrogen was incorporated into ant biomass. Symbiotic N2-fixing bacteria were consistently isolated from the fungus gardens of 80 leaf-cutter ant colonies collected in Argentina, Costa Rica, and Panama. The discovery of N2 fixation within the leaf-cutter ant-microbe symbiosis reveals a previously unrecognized nitrogen source in neotropical ecosystems.

Behavioral match evaluation of spatial cognition in rats and robots. In this paper we present a comparative behavioral analysis of spatial cognition in rats and robots by contrasting a similar goal-oriented task in a cyclical maze, where a computational system-level model of rat spatial cognition is used integrating kinesthetic and visual information to produce a cognitive map of the environment and drive robot experimentation. A discussion of experiments in rats and robots is presented contrasting learning latency while characterizing behavioral procedures such as body rotations during navigation and election of routes to the goal.

Diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an aggressive malignancy with the majority of patients dying within one year of diagnosis. While surgical resection with negative margins offers the only hope for cure only a small minority of patients are amenable to resection at the time of diagnosis owing to the propensity for early metastasis. While most advances in the last several decades have revolved around improvements in surgical techniques and postoperative outcomes, some modest inroads have been made with modern chemotherapy. This review discusses the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cancer and highlights some of the current issues. A Medline database search was performed to identify relevant articles using the keywords "pancreatic adenocarcinoma", "diagnosis", "CA19-9", "pancreaticoduodenectomy", "adjuvant therapy", "chemotherapy", and "microRNA". Additional papers were then identified by a manual search of the references from the key articles. While high quality CT is often the only imaging modality needed for preoperative evaluation, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cholangiography, and endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) have been utilized for diagnosis, staging, and/ or palliation. The controversies of pylorus preservation, extended lymphadenectomy, and laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy are discussed. Randomized controlled trials regarding the use of 5-fluorouracil and gemcitabine are also reviewed. Early detection and aggressive surgical resection in combination with protocol-driven adjuvant therapy and novel molecular approaches are the only hope for cure. This review summarizes the recent literature on the abovementioned topics.

Terlipressin therapy for renal failure in cirrhosis. Renal failure is common in cirrhosis frequently due to hepatorenal syndrome (HRS). Terlipressin and albumin improve renal function with a trend to prolong survival in HRS, but prognostic factors with therapy have been poorly studied. Forty-five cirrhotics seen consecutively in a single centre with renal failure defined as oliguria/anuria and/or rising creatinine and no response to volume loading, without intrinsic renal disease, sepsis, gastrointestinal bleeding [median Child-Pugh score 12(8-14)/Model for End-Stage Liver Disease 29(10-40)], had intravenous terlipressin and albumin and were audited retrospectively classified into three groups: group 1 HRS type 1 (15), group 2 HRS type 2 (11) and group 3(19): not fulfilling HRS 1 or 2 criteria. Baseline median creatinine was 1.7 (0.9-5.46) mg/dl and 30 (67%) had creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dl. All 45 patients had initial colloid/albumin and 31 continued terlipressin (2-4 mg/day) for a median 8 (2-76) days. Improvement in serum creatinine occurred in 23 (51%) [(1.3 mg/dl (0.6-3.9)] compared with baseline [1.7 mg/dl (0.92-3.75)] (P<0.001). In the multivariate analysis a greater reduction in creatinine between baseline and day 4 (95% confidence interval, odds ratio: 0.25) was associated with improved survival at 6 weeks. Albumin and terlipressin improve renal failure in the absence of sepsis in cirrhosis independently of whether HRS criteria are fulfilled or not. Improvement at 4 days of therapy is associated with better survival. Randomized studies are needed for oliguria and rising creatinine in cirrhotics even if HRS criteria are not fulfilled.

Hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase: a new risk gene for multiple sclerosis. A recent genome-wide association study (GWAS) performed by the The Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium based on 12 374 nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) provided evidence for several genes involved in multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility. In this study, we aimed at verifying the association of 19 SNPs with MS, with P-values < or =0.005, in an independent cohort of 732 patients and 974 controls, all Caucasian from the South of Spain. We observed an association of the rs17368528 polymorphism with MS (P=0.04, odds ratio (OR)=0.801, 95% confidence interval (CI)=0.648-0.990). The association of this polymorphism with MS was further validated in an independent set of 1318 patients from the Canadian Collaborative Project (P=0.04, OR=0.838, 95% CI=0.716-0.964). This marker is located on chromosome 1p36.22, which is 1 Mb away from the MS-associated kinesin motor protein KIF1B, although linkage disequilibrium was not observed between these two markers. The rs17368528 SNP results in an amino-acid substitution (proline to leucine) in the fifth exon of the hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (H6PD) gene, in which some variants have been reported to attenuate or abolish H6PD activity, in individuals with cortisone reductase deficiency. This study corroborates the association of one locus determined by GWAS and points to H6PD as a new candidate gene for MS.

Safety and immunogenicity of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in infants: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. Infants less than 6 months of age are at high risk for influenza disease and influenza-related complications, but no vaccine is licensed for this population. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 1375 healthy US infants 6 to 12 weeks of age. Subjects received 2 doses of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV, Fluzone, sanofi pasteur; N = 915) or placebo (N = 460) 1 month apart in combination with indicated concomitant vaccines. Solicited adverse events were collected for 7 days following vaccination, and unsolicited adverse events for 28 days. Hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies to all 3 vaccine strains were measured following the second TIV/placebo dose. No significant differences were seen between TIV and placebo groups for any safety outcome. Fever > or =38 degrees C within 3 days of vaccination was seen in 11.2% versus 11.7% of TIV versus placebo recipients. Serious adverse events within 28 days were reported in 1.9% of TIV and 1.5% of placebo recipients. Antibody responses to childhood vaccines were similar in both groups. Increased influenza-specific antibody responses in TIV recipients compared with placebo recipients were seen against all 3 strains in TIV recipients (P < 0.001), with better responses to influenza A strains noted. Reciprocal geometrical mean titer to H1N1, H3N2, and B were 33, 95, and 11 in TIV recipients versus 7, 9, and 5 for placebo recipients. Over 90% of TIV recipients had antibody > or =1:40 for at least 1 vaccine strain and 49.6% for 2 strains, versus 16.4% and 0.9% in placebo-recipients. TIV administered to young infants beginning at 6 to 12 weeks of age is safe and immunogenic.

Assessment of malignant liver tumors in children. Imaging plays a crucial role in the management of a child with a suspected liver tumor. There are various important differences between pediatric and adult practice, and in particular several liver tumor types that are almost never seen in adults are not uncommon in children. The radiologist makes important contributions to the diagnosis through non-invasive imaging and often biopsy. This paper describes imaging tips for the radiologist, including a discussion of the PRETEXT system for staging primary malignant tumors.

[Stroke etiology and long-term need of care in ischemic stroke patients]. About 80 % of all strokes are of ischemic origin. Among these the Trial of ORG 10 172 in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification denotes five the etiological categories: large-artery atherosclerosis, cardioembolism, small-artery occlusion, strokes of undetermined etiology and strokes of other determined etiology, which are based on imaging and diagnostic findings. The object of research is the distribution of these TOAST categories in a demographically defined population and their impact on the need of care. The present study involves patients recruited within the population-based Erlangen Stroke Project (ESPro). The patients were analysed at time points after admission as well as 3 and 12 month after the event. results were presented as adjusted Odds Ratios (aOR). 1355 patients with a first-ever-in-a-lifetime ischemic stroke were registered in the Community of Erlangen. TOAST classification could be performed in 89 % (1206) of ischemic strokes. The etiological classification of brain infarctions resulted in 12 % large-artery atherosclerosis, 26 % cardioembolism, 24 % small-artery occlusion, 37 % strokes of undetermined etiology and 2 % strokes of other determined etiology. While 20 % of the patients were independent functionally at the Barthel index at admission, the number was 39 % after 12 month. The category large-artery atherosclerosis showed the strongest relationship with the occurring need of care. The aOR with very strong care needs 12.79 (95 % CI 3.71 -44.07) lay particularly high in comparison with an aOR of 6.95 (95 % CI 2.16 - 22.33) in the category cardioembolism. The TOAST classification provides an appropriate tool for estimating the need of care. In particular the patients in the TOAST category large-artery atherosclerosis showed a high level of a need of care at the long-term follow-up.

Feedback inhibition of ammonium uptake by a phospho-dependent allosteric mechanism in Arabidopsis. The acquisition of nutrients requires tight regulation to ensure optimal supply while preventing accumulation to toxic levels. Ammonium transporter/methylamine permease/rhesus (AMT/Mep/Rh) transporters are responsible for ammonium acquisition in bacteria, fungi, and plants. The ammonium transporter AMT1;1 from Arabidopsis thaliana uses a novel regulatory mechanism requiring the productive interaction between a trimer of subunits for function. Allosteric regulation is mediated by a cytosolic C-terminal trans-activation domain, which carries a conserved Thr (T460) in a critical position in the hinge region of the C terminus. When expressed in yeast, mutation of T460 leads to inactivation of the trimeric complex. This study shows that phosphorylation of T460 is triggered by ammonium in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Neither Gln nor l-methionine sulfoximine-induced ammonium accumulation were effective in inducing phosphorylation, suggesting that roots use either the ammonium transporter itself or another extracellular sensor to measure ammonium concentrations in the rhizosphere. Phosphorylation of T460 in response to an increase in external ammonium correlates with inhibition of ammonium uptake into Arabidopsis roots. Thus, phosphorylation appears to function in a feedback loop restricting ammonium uptake. This novel autoregulatory mechanism is capable of tuning uptake capacity over a wide range of supply levels using an extracellular sensory system, potentially mediated by a transceptor (i.e., transporter and receptor).


Why isn't more injury prevention evidence-based?

Recombinant human epidermal growth factor accelerates the proliferation of irradiated human fibroblasts and keratinocytes in vitro and in vivo. Irradiation causes the impaired proliferation of cells lining mucosal membranes. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) facilitates proliferation of various skin cells; however, the wound healing effects of EGF on radiation-damaged cells is less well known. To evaluate the effects of recombinant human EGF (rhEGF) on the proliferation of cells following irradiation, we tested two types of fibroblast cell lines and one keratinocyte cell line. The viable cell numbers were significantly increased by rhEGF treatment for 24 h immediately after 8 Gy of irradiation. The most effective dose of rhEGF was 10 nM in all cell lines used in this study. The percentage of BrdU-labeled cells was also significantly increased by rhEGF treatment. To evaluate the effects of rhEGF on radiation-induced oral mucosal damage in BALB/c mice, we systematically injected 1 mg/kg/day EGF for three days after 17 Gy of irradiation. Administered rhEGF ameliorated radiation-induced mucosal damage in vivo. rhEGF significantly increased the epithelial cell layer thickness and the proliferation of basal layer cells as detected by Ki-67 staining. Our results suggest that rhEGF can be a therapeutic treatment for radiation-induced wounds by stimulating the proliferation of fibroblasts and keratinocytes following irradiation.


Muscle fatigue of quadriceps in paraplegics: comparison between single vs. multi-pad electrode surface stimulation.

[Periodicity of capture of the Anopheles darlingi Root (Diptera: Culicidae) in Porto Velho, RondÃ´nia, Brazil]. Anopheles darlingi Root is the principal malaria vector in Amazonia region. The objectives of this work were to study the periodicity of Anopheles darlingi Root, the host preference for peri or extra-domestic environments and the parous rate in four field sites in Porto Velho (RO) by human-landing. All of the Anopheles specimens collected were identified, but only A. darlingi was dissected for the parous study. The results showed that human-landing colleted a total of 985 anophelines, with A. darlingi (972) being the most abundant species. Female mosquitoes were more abundant at extra-domestic environments in two of the locations studied (SÃ£o JoÃ£o e Candeias do Jamari) (P < 0.05). The parous rate was 96% and no periodicity was observed for captures of females of A. darlingi in the field sites.

Effects of intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin) therapy on retrobulbar blood flow parameters in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration. To investigate the effects of intravitreal bevacizumab on retrobulbar circulation in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Thirty patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration were assessed prospectively by both color Doppler imaging and fundus fluorescein angiography. Spectral Doppler analysis allowed the measurement of the maximum velocity (Vmax) and minimum velocity (Vmin) of the central retinal vein (CRV), and peak systolic (PSV), end-diastolic (EDV) velocities of blood flows, and pulsatility index (PI) and resistance index (RI) values in the central retinal artery (CRA), nasal and temporal posterior ciliary arteries (NPCA, TPCA), and ophthalmic artery (OA). The t test for paired samples was used to compare retrobulbar blood flow values before and after intravitreal bevacizumab injection. PSV and EDV of the NPCA and PSV of the TPCA were significantly decreased after intravitreal bevacizumab injection (p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference in the other parameters. Our results suggest that intravitreal bevacizumab therapy has a measurable effect on retrobulbar blood flow.

Heart rate variability and nonlinear analysis of heart rate dynamics following single and multiple Wingate bouts. Sprint interval training involves short bouts of high-intensity exercise and has produced training responses similar to those of endurance training. The effects of multiple supramaximal exercise bouts on neurocardiac modulation have not been examined. Therefore, we investigated the recovery of heart rate (HR) variability and nonlinear HR dynamics in 10 young (20.1 +/- 1.2 years) healthy males following single (1) and multiple (4) Wingate tests. HR variability was assessed with time and frequency domain measures, whereas nonlinear HR dynamics were determined by assessing the complexity (sample entropy) and fractal nature (detrended fluctuation analysis) of the HR time series. Responses were determined at pre-exercise baseline and at 3 time points during recovery from exercise: Post1 (5-20 min), Post2 (45-60 min), and Post3 (105-120 min). Following a single Wingate test, all temporal and spectral HR measures had returned to baseline by 1 h of recovery. In contrast, these measures were different from baseline at 2 h following multiple Wingate tests. Fractal HR properties were altered (p < 0.05) at Post1 following a single Wingate test and at Post1 and Post2 following multiple Wingate tests. HR complexity was reduced (p < 0.001) throughout the 2-h recovery following both exercise conditions. In conclusion, Wingate tests result in alterations in cardiac autonomic control, with multiple Wingate tests resulting in larger, more prolonged alterations. Based on the results of the single Wingate test, nonlinear measures, such as HR complexity, may be more sensitive in detecting subtle alterations in neurocardiac behaviour, compared with traditional measures of HR variability.

Drug delivery for treatment of inner ear disease: current state of knowledge. Delivery of medications to the inner ear has been an area of considerable growth in both the research and clinical realms during the past several decades. Systemic delivery of medication destined for treatment of the inner ear is the foundation on which newer delivery techniques have been developed. Because of systemic side effects, investigators and clinicians have begun developing and using techniques to deliver therapeutic agents locally. Alongside the now commonplace use of intratympanic gentamicin for Meniere's disease and the emerging use of intratympanic steroids for sudden sensorineural hearing loss, novel technologies, such as hydrogels and nanoparticles, are being explored. At the horizon of inner ear drug-delivery techniques, intracochlear devices that leverage recent advances in microsystems technology are being developed to apply medications directly into the inner ear. Potential uses for such devices include neurotrophic factor and steroid delivery with cochlear implantation, RNA interference technologies, and stem-cell therapy. The historical, current, and future delivery techniques and uses of drug delivery for treatment of inner ear disease serve as the basis for this review.

Principles of neuroanesthesia in stroke surgery. Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is a devastating disease with a high incidence of morbidity and mortality. The main aims of therapy are the prevention of rebleeding and the prevention and treatment of delayed cerebral ischemia. SAH is manifested with a variable combination of symptoms and is accompanied by various systemic disturbances, such as cardiac arrhythmias and insufficiency, neurogenic pulmonary edema, and electrolyte disorders.Successful perioperative treatment - apart from the surgical and endovascular techniques - requires solid knowledge and understanding of the regulation of cerebral hemodynamics, and the effects of subarachnoid hemorrhage and other diseases and various drugs, including the anesthetic agents, on it.In the following, the basic principles of neuroanesthesia for patients with SAH are reviewed.

The role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in different animal models of neuropathic pain. Even in present day pain therapy, neuropathic pain remains a challenge for clinicians to treat and a challenge for researchers to investigate. Different animal models have been developed to mimic neuropathic pain. Neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor, brain-derived neurotrophic factor and neurotrophin 3 have been studied extensively in these models, yet few review articles concerning brain-derived neurotrophic factor have been published. This article reassesses the literature concerning brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in the sciatic nerve chronic constriction injury model, the sciatic nerve transection model, the spinal nerve ligation model and the spinal nerve transection model and discusses differences in regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor between these models and their causality with neuropathic pain.

Toxocariasis might be an important cause of atopic myelitis in Korea. Atopic myelitis is defined as myelitis with atopic diasthesis but the cause is still unknown. Toxocariasis is one of the common causes of hyperIgEaemia that may lead to neurologic manifestations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sero-prevalence of Toxocara specific IgG Ab among the atopic myelitis patients. We evaluated the medical records of 37 patients with atopic myelitis whose conditions were diagnosed between March 2001 and August 2007. Among them, the 33 sera were analyzed for specific serum IgG Ab to Toxocara excretory-secretory antigens (TES). All of 37 patients had hyperIgEaemia. Specific IgE to D. pteronyssinus and D. farinae was detected in 22 (64.7%) and 34 (100%) patients, respectively, of the 34 patients. Thirty-one of 33 patients (93.9%) were found to be positive by TES IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Based on the image findings of eosinophilic infiltrations in the lung and liver, 8 patients had positive results. These results inferred that the prevalence of toxocariasis was high in patients with atopic myelitis. Our results suggest that toxocariasis might be an important cause of atopic myelitis and Toxocara ELISA is essential for evaluating the causes of atopic myelitis.


Predictors of long-term exercise adherence in a community-based sample of older women.

Dietary-induced ERbeta upregulation counteracts intestinal neoplasia development in intact male ApcMin/+ mice. Most sporadic colorectal cancers (CRCs) develop through the adenoma-carcinoma sequence pathway and are initiated by adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations. Estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) is recognized to progressively reduce its expression in adenomatous and carcinomatous tissues in humans. Moreover, ERbeta deficiency enhances small intestinal tumorigenesis in rodents. In the Apc(Min/+) mouse model, we evaluated intestinal polyp development and ERbeta expression plus other biological parameters influencing tumor growth (epithelial cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration) following the addition of a combination of the ERbeta-selective agonist silymarin (SIL) and/or lignin (LIG) to a high-fat/low-fiber diet. Forty-five Apc(Min/+) mice were divided in four groups: animals fed on the tumorigenic high-fat/low-fiber diet, the tumorigenic diet supplemented with SIL (0.02%) or purified LIG (6.24%) or SIL (0.005%) + LIG (6.24%). In these animals, we assessed polyp number and volume and their degree of dysplasia together with ERbeta messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein levels and epithelial cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. The latter group of parameters was evaluated in normal and adenomatous mucosa and the results compared with those found in wild-type (WT) mice fed on the control diet. The addition of SIL or LIG to the diet and even more the specific combination of the two significantly counteracted intestinal tumorigenesis and increased ERbeta mRNA and protein levels. Cell proliferation and apoptosis were rebalanced and cell migration accelerated, restoring values similar to those observed in WT animals. Our results further support a protective effect of ERbeta in CRC suggesting the use of the combination of SIL-LIG as a potential approach against CRC development.

Racial Disparities in Health-Related Quality of Life After Lung Cancer Surgery: Findings From the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium. This study investigated racial disparities in postsurgical health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Data were collected by the Cancer Care Outcomes Research and Surveillance Consortium. Inclusion criteria were greater than or equal to 21 years of age, NSCLC, and receipt of surgery. HRQOL data were available from patients' surveys, and complete medical record abstraction was performed to obtain clinical data. HRQOL was assessed by the physical/mental component summary scores (PCS/MCS) of the 12-item Short-Form Health Survey at two time points. Mean time between surgery and the initial assessment (time 1) after surgery was 4.1 (SD 2.2) months and between surgery and second assessment (time 2) was 12.7 (SD 3.8) months. Multivariable linear regression models were used to examine associations between race and HRQOL. Of 650 patients, 80.5% were White, 8.8% Black, and 10.7% other races. At second assessment, Blacks reported lower MCS than Whites (47.4 versus 52.6, p = 0.002). In multivariable analysis, Blacks had lower MCS compared with Whites. No difference was found between Whites and Blacks on PCS. Those with less than high school education reported lower MCSs. Older age and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery were associated with gain in MCS. Male, less than college education, and comorbidities were associated with impaired PCS. Older age was associated with improved PCS. Racial disparities exist in postoperative mental HRQOL. Results highlight the need for interventions after lung cancer surgery to improve mental health in Black and younger patients.

Raf kinase inhibitor protein enhances neuronal differentiation in human SH-SY5Y cells. Neuronal differentiation has evolved as an essential process even in the adult brain, once disturbed being associated with the pathogenesis of several psychiatric disorders. To study the effects of Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP) on neuronal differentiation, we generated neuroblastoma cell lines overexpressing RKIP (RKIP(+)) and expressing RKIP-directed short hairpin RNA for downregulation of RKIP (RKIP(-)). During a 4-week time course of continuous differentiation by retinoic acid (RA), expression of neuronal and glial markers, intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels, protein kinase C (PKC) signal transduction to extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK-1/2) and cellular morphology were investigated in relation to RKIP levels. RKIP(+) cells showed accelerated neurite outgrowth, formation of elaborated neuronal networks and increased neuronal marker expression both in RA-induced differentiation and to some extent even in non-RA-treated cells. RKIP(-) cells showed glial-like cell bodies and increased glial fibrillary acidic protein, suggesting a shift from neuronal to glial phenotype. With respect to differentiation-inducing signal pathways, PKC-mediated ERK-1/2 activation significantly correlated with RKIP levels. Furthermore, basal and forskolin-stimulated intracellular cAMP was potently increased in RKIP(+) cells versus controls. In conclusion, the conserved signal transduction modulator RKIP was shown to enhance several aspects of neuronal differentiation via enhanced crosstalk from PKC to ERK-1/2 and enhancement of G-protein-coupled receptor signaling.

Echocardiographic and spiroergometric data of elite Hungarian female water polo players. In the authors' earlier study the relative aerobic power of Hungarian top-level male water polo players was found to be smaller than that of other top-level athletes, while their echocardiographic parameters proved to be the most characteristic of the athlete's heart. In the present investigation echocardiographic and spiroergometric data of female top-level water polo players were compared to those of other female elite athletes and of healthy, non-athletic subjects. Relative aerobic power in the water polo players was lower than in endurance athletes. Mean resting heart rates were the slowest in the water polo players and endurance athletes. Morphologic indicators of the heart (body size related left ventricular wall thickness and muscle mass) were the highest in the water polo players, endurance and power athletes. In respect of diastolic functions (diastolic early and late peak transmitral flow velocities) no difference was seen between the respective groups.These results indicate that, similarly to the males, top-level water polo training is associated with the dimensional parameters of the heart rather than with relative aerobic power. For checking the physical condition of female water polo players spiroergometric tests seem to be less appropriate than swim-tests with heart rate recovery studies such as the ones used in the males.

How do mycobacteria activate CD8+ T cells? CD8(+) T cells are activated upon presentation of antigens from the cytosol. Therefore, it was unclear how pathogenic mycobacteria could prime this type of lymphocyte, given that these microbes were thought to remain in phagosomes and, hence, be shielded from the host cytosol. Recently, it was shown that some mycobacteria can enter the cytosol through translocation from phagolysosomes, providing a direct mechanism for CD8(+) T cell priming. However, this mechanism might not apply to other mycobacteria, which do not appear to be able to enter the cytosol. Here, we discuss the different hypotheses to explain the induction of CD8(+) T cell responses in mycobacterial infections.


Ultrastructural response of arcuate nucleus neurons to fasting in aged rats.

Sentinel node status prediction by four statistical models: results from a large bi-institutional series (n = 1132). To improve selection for sentinel node (SN) biopsy (SNB) in patients with cutaneous melanoma using statistical models predicting SN status. About 80% of patients currently undergoing SNB are node negative. In the absence of conclusive evidence of a SNBassociated survival benefit, these patients may be over-treated. Here, we tested the efficiency of 4 different models in predicting SN status. The clinicopathologic data (age, gender, tumor thickness, Clark level, regression, ulceration, histologic subtype, and mitotic index) of 1132 melanoma patients who had undergone SNB at institutions in Italy and Australia were analyzed. Logistic regression, classification tree, random forest, and support vector machine models were fitted to the data. The predictive models were built with the aim of maximizing the negative predictive value (NPV) and reducing the rate of SNB procedures though minimizing the error rate. After cross-validation logistic regression, classification tree, random forest, and support vector machine predictive models obtained clinically relevant NPV (93.6%, 94.0%, 97.1%, and 93.0%, respectively), SNB reduction (27.5%, 29.8%, 18.2%, and 30.1%, respectively), and error rates (1.8%, 1.8%, 0.5%, and 2.1%, respectively). Using commonly available clinicopathologic variables, predictive models can preoperatively identify a proportion of patients ( approximately 25%) who might be spared SNB, with an acceptable (1%-2%) error. If validated in large prospective series, these models might be implemented in the clinical setting for improved patient selection, which ultimately would lead to better quality of life for patients and optimization of resource allocation for the health care system.

Change in prevalence of group B Streptococcus maternal colonisation in Hong Kong. To re-examine the prevalence of group B Streptococcus colonisation in our antenatal population, and identify demographic factors associated with carriage. Prospective observational study. A tertiary obstetrics unit in Hong Kong. A total of 1002 pregnant women were recruited at the booking clinic in a tertiary obstetrics unit in Hong Kong. High and low vaginal swabs and rectal swabs were taken for group B Streptococcus culture. Demographic data and delivery outcomes of the recruits were analysed. The prevalence of group B Streptococcus colonisation in our antenatal population was 10.4%. The majority of carriers were identified by low vaginal swabs (78%), while high vaginal swabs and rectal swabs only identified 31% and 30% of the carriers, respectively. Professional women yielded a higher carrier rate than housewives (21% vs 10%, P=0.03). There was no increase in preterm delivery rate in group B Streptococcus carriers. We noted a dramatic increase in the prevalence of group B Streptococcus colonisation in the Hong Kong pregnant population at their booking visit. Professional women had a higher colonisation rate compared to other groups.

Molecular detection of Leishmania infantum in naturally infected Phlebotomus perniciosus from Algarve region, Portugal. In Portugal, Phlebotomus perniciosus and P. ariasi, (Subgenus Larroussius; Diptera: Psychodidae) are the proven vectors of leishmaniasis caused by Leishmania infantum. The Algarve Region in southern Portugal has been considered an endemic focus of leishmaniasis since 1980s. The main objective of the present study was to validate a molecular approach to detect Leishmania infection in phlebotomines based on DNA extraction from the female sandfly whole body, minus genitalia, followed by PCR for application on epidemiological surveys. In Algarve Region, from early May until early November 2006, sandflies were captured by CDC miniature light-traps. kDNA-PCR and ITS1-PCR were used to screen the presence of Leishmania DNA in female sandflies after species identification by entomological keys. A total of 474 sandflies were collected in 108 biotopes. One female of P. perniciosus, the predominant species, was found infected with L. infantum reflecting an overall infection rate of 0.47%. PCR associated with morphological characterization of the sandflies will be a powerful epidemiological tool for the determination of the number of phlebotomines infected with Leishmania spp in nature. In addition, the simultaneous occurrence of dogs and P. perniciosus infected with L. infantum shows that Algarve continues to be an endemic focus of canine leishmaniasis. Furthermore, as P. sergenti and P. papatasi which transmit L. tropica and L. major, respectively were present, the future introduction of these two Leishmania species in southern region of Portugal should not be neglected.

Are howler monkey species ecologically equivalent? Trophic niche overlap in syntopic Alouatta guariba clamitans and Alouatta caraya. According to the principle of competitive exclusion, niche differentiation allows the stable coexistence of closely related species. We analyzed dietary profile and diversity, and dietary overlap between syntopic brown howlers (BR; Alouatta guariba clamitans) and black and gold howlers (BLG; A. caraya) in the Atlantic Forest of NE Argentina, with the objective of evaluating the degree of trophic niche overlap and potential interspecific competition for food. During 12 months, we collected data on feeding behavior of two groups of each howler species using the scan sampling method, together with data on food availability. Both at the group- and species-level, we analyzed feeding behavior in terms of monthly percentages of time spent feeding on each food type and specific food item, dietary diversity (Shannon index H'), and we estimated dietary overlap using the percentage index and the Morisita-Horn index (C(H)). Across months, both howlers showed species-specific preferences for certain food items, and BLG had a more diverse diet (mean+/-SE, H'=2.77+/-0.08) than BR (H'=2.39+/-0.09). However, diets of both species overlapped extensively (percentage index=45.64+/-2.97%; C(H)=0.6+/-0.05) and diets of conspecific groups did not overlap more than diets of groups of different species. Given their high degree of trophic overlap, syntopic BR and BLG meet one of the conditions necessary for interspecific food competition to occur. Although at present we lack direct evidence for interspecific competition in these howler species, we conclude that high levels of niche overlap may have an important role in maintaining the essentially parapatric distribution of howler species throughout the Neotropics.

Structure and vascular tissue expression of duplicated TERMINAL EAR1-like paralogues in poplar. TERMINAL EAR1-like (TEL) genes encode putative RNA-binding proteins only found in land plants. Previous studies suggested that they may regulate tissue and organ initiation in Poaceae. Two TEL genes were identified in both Populus trichocarpa and the hybrid aspen Populus tremula x P. alba, named, respectively, PoptrTEL1-2 and PtaTEL1-2. The analysis of the organisation around the PoptrTEL genes in the P. trichocarpa genome and the estimation of the synonymous substitution rate for PtaTEL1-2 genes indicate that the paralogous link between these two Populus TEL genes probably results from the Salicoid large-scale gene-duplication event. Phylogenetic analyses confirmed their orthology link with the other TEL genes. The expression pattern of both PtaTEL genes appeared to be restricted to the mother cells of the plant body: leaf founder cells, leaf primordia, axillary buds and root differentiating tissues, as well as to mother cells of vascular tissues. Most interestingly, PtaTEL1-2 transcripts were found in differentiating cells of secondary xylem and phloem, but probably not in the cambium itself. Taken together, these results indicate specific expression of the TEL genes in differentiating cells controlling tissue and organ development in Populus (and other Angiosperm species).


Characterization of two different types of UDP-glucose/-galactose 4-epimerase involved in galactosylation in fission yeast.

The impact of dopamine on hemodynamics, oxygen metabolism, and cerebral resuscitation after restoration of spontaneous circulation in pigs. Restoration of spontaneous circulation after cardiopulmonary resuscitation in cardiac arrest patients does not always signal a completely successful outcome. Functional deficiencies of the nervous system are found in many survivors of cardiac arrest. To study the effects of dopamine-induced elevated blood pressure on the hemodynamics, oxygen metabolism, and cerebral resuscitation in different perfusion conditions in a resuscitated animal model. There were 18 pigs included in the study. Ventricular fibrillation (VF) was induced with a programmed electrical stimulation device. After 4 min of untreated ventricular fibrillation followed by 9 min of CPR, 12 animals were resuscitated successfully, and were then randomly assigned to either the study group (dopamine group) or the control group (normal perfusion group). All animals in the two groups received normal saline through continuous intravenous guttae for 4 h at a rate of 15 mL/kg/h. In the study group, dopamine was added to raise the animals' blood pressure. Four hours of intensive monitoring was performed for all study animals. Finally, 24-h evaluation of neurological function was conducted in surviving animals in accordance with the standard of the Cerebral Performance Category Score. In animals in the dopamine group, the cardiac output, mean aortic pressure, coronary perfusion pressure, oxygen delivery, and oxygen consumption were higher than those found in the animals in the normal perfusion group (p < 0.05). Oxygen metabolism was remarkably improved in animals in the dopamine group. Furthermore, cerebral perfusion was better in the dopamine group than in the control group and thus, results of the evaluation of nervous system function were better in animals treated with dopamine (p < 0.05). Dopamine improved systemic perfusion, cerebral blood supply, and oxygen metabolism after successful resuscitation from VF in a porcine model. All of these factors have profound effects on the cerebral resuscitation.


Probability of extraprostatic disease according to the percentage of positive biopsy cores in clinically localized prostate cancer.

A new functional classification system (FGA/B) with prognostic value for glioma patients. Despite advances in multimodal treatments, malignant gliomas remain characterized by a short survival time. Surgical treatment is accepted to be the first line of therapy, with recent studies revealing that maximal possible tumor reduction exerts significant impact on patient outcome. Consideration of tumor localization in relation to functionally eloquent brain areas has been gaining increasing importance. Despite existing assessment methods, the availability of a simple but reliable preoperative grading based on functional data would therefore prove to be indispensable for the prediction of postoperative outcome and hence for overall survival in glioma patients. We performed a clinical investigation comprising 322 patients with gliomas and developed a novel classification system of preoperative tumor status, which considers tumor operability based on two graduations (Friedlein Grading - FG): FGA with lesions at safe distance to eloquent regions which can be completely resected, and FGB referring to tumors which can only be partially resected or biopsied. Investigation of outcome revealed that FGA were characterized by a significantly longer overall survival time compared to FGB. We offer the opportunity to classify brain tumors in a dependable and reproducible manner. The FGA/B grading method provides high prognostic value with respect to overall survival time in relation to the extent of location-dependent tumor resection.

Phosphorus dissolution from ash of incinerated sewage sludge and animal carcasses using sulphuric acid.

Highly efficient cyanoimidation of aldehydes. Cyanoimidation of aldehydes using cyanamide as a nitrogen source and using NBS as an oxidant was achieved in high yields without the addition of a catalyst. The method has several advantages, including mild conditions, simple workflow, and inexpensive reagents. The reaction proceeds in a one-pot manner, giving rise to the formation of intermolecular C-N and C-O bonds. Subsequently, the substituted N-cyanobenimidate products may also undergo a cyclization reaction to give l,2,4-triazole derivatives in high yields.

Abortion and protection of the human fetus: religious and legal problems in Pakistan. Abortion is the most common and controversial issue in many parts of the world. Approximately 46 million abortions are performed worldwide every year. The world ratio is 26 induced abortions per 100 known pregnancies. Pakistan has an estimated abortion rate of 29 abortions per 1,000 women of reproductive age, despite the procedure being illegal except to save a woman's life. 890,000 abortions are performed annually in Pakistan. Many government and non-government organizations are working on the issue of abortion. Muslim jurists are unanimous in declaring that after the fetus is completely formed and has been given a soul, abortion is haram (forbidden).

Possible participation of calmodulin in the decondensation of nuclei isolated from guinea pig spermatozoa. The guinea pig spermatozoid nucleus contains actin, myosin, spectrin and cytokeratin. Also, it has been reported that phalloidin and/or 2,3-butanedione monoxime retard the sperm nuclear decondensation caused by heparin, suggesting a role for F-actin and myosin in nuclear stability. The presence of an F-actin/myosin dynamic system in these nuclei led us to search for proteins usually related to this system. In guinea pig sperm nuclei we detected calmodulin, F-actin, the myosin light chain and an actin-myosin complex. To define whether calmodulin participates in nuclear-dynamics, the effect of the calmodulin antagonists W5, W7 and calmidazolium was tested on the decondensation of nuclei promoted by either heparin or by a Xenopus laevis egg extract. All antagonists inhibited both the heparin- and the X. laevis egg extract-mediated nuclear decondensation. Heparin-mediated decondensation was faster and led to loss of nuclei. The X. laevis egg extract-promoted decondensation was slower and did not result in loss of the decondensed nuclei. It is suggested that in guinea pig sperm calmodulin participates in the nuclear decondensation process.

Maximizing exercise in breast cancer survivors. Regular physical exercise can maximize physical, mental, and social well-being during and after treatment in breast cancer survivors. An exercise program following cancer therapy is facilitated by instilling a positive attitude toward exercise, confidence in conquering barriers, and a supportive social environment. The purpose of this article is to describe the benefits of moderate exercise in breast cancer survivors and propose a comprehensive approach for the cancer care team in maximizing survivor efforts to improve their physical strength and endurance after completion of adjuvant therapy for breast cancer (surgery, chemotherapy, and/or radiation). A moderate exercise program can help most survivors become more physically and mentally fit and energetic. Understanding factors that prompt the initiation of healthy lifestyle choices among breast cancer survivors is critical to encouraging an attitude of healthy living.

Comparative resistance of food proteins to adult and infant in vitro digestion models. IgE-mediated allergy to milk and egg is widespread in industrialised countries and mainly affects infants and young children. It may be connected to an incomplete digestion of dietary proteins causing an inappropriate immune response in the gut. In order to study this, a biochemical model of infant gastroduodenal digestion has been developed, which has reduced levels of protease (eightfold for pepsin and tenfold for trypsin and chymotrypsin), phosphatidylcholine and bile salts, compared with the adult model. This model has been used to study the behaviour of three characterised food-relevant proteins (bovine beta-lactoglobulin (beta-Lg), beta-casein (beta-CN) and hen's egg ovalbumin), all of which are relevant cows' milk and hens' egg allergens. Digestion products were characterised using electrophoresis, immunochemical techniques and MS. These showed that ovalbumin and beta-CN were digested more slowly using the infant model compared with the adult conditions. Resistant fragments of beta-CN were found in the infant model, which correspond to previously identified IgE epitopes. Surprisingly, beta-Lg was more extensively degraded in the infant model compared with the adult one. This difference was attributed to the tenfold reduction in phosphatidylcholine concentration in the infant model limiting the protective effect of this phospholipid on beta-Lg digestion.

Estimates of the prevalence of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, United States, April-July 2009. Through July 2009, a total of 43,677 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were reported in the United States, which is likely a substantial underestimate of the true number. Correcting for under-ascertainment using a multiplier model, we estimate that 1.8 million-5.7 million cases occurred, including 9,000-21,000 hospitalizations.

Osteoplastic atticoantrotomy with autologous bone chips and a bony attic strut in cholesteatoma surgery. The objectives of this study were to determine whether autologous bone chips are suitable materials for canal wall reconstruction after cholesteatoma removal and to evaluate the effectiveness of a separate attic bone graft for the prevention or recurrent cholesteatomas using prospective study of two consecutive patient series (29/31 unselected patients with an average follow-up of 36.3 +/- 11.1/21.5 +/- 6.3 months) and retrograde resection of the posterior-superior canal wall followed by reconstruction of the canal defect using one or more temporal squama bone chips. In the second series, lateral attic wall reconstruction and pars flaccida reinforcement was established by a notched bony attic strut attached onto the neck and short process of the malleus for structural support. In the first series, the rate of recurrent cholesteatomas (17.3%), in particular of attic retraction pockets (31%), was significantly high. The average postoperative air-bone gap was 6.4 +/- 6.3 dB in type-I tympanoplasty (TP), 8.7 +/- 3.4 dB in type-III TP with intact stapes suprastructure, and 16.4 +/- 9.3 dB in type-III TP with TORP, respectively. In the second series, recurrent cholesteatoma and retraction pocket rate could be decreased to 9.7 and 6.5%, respectively. The postoperative air-bone gap was 7.5 +/- 5.1 dB HL in type-I tympanoplasty (TP), 11.6 +/- 4.9 dB HL in type-III (PORP) TP, and 17.9 +/- 12.2 dB HL in type-III (TORP) TP. Connecting the attic strut to the malleus neck did not affect the malleus mobility and hearing outcome. Osteoplastic atticoantrotomy with autologous bone chip reconstruction enables a tailor-made anatomical and physiological reconstitution of the auditory ear canal, thus enhancing the acoustic properties. Precise reconstruction of the lateral attic wall and reinforcement of the superior part of the tympanic membrane seems to be important for the prevention of retraction pockets and subsequent recurrent cholesteatoma development.

Effect of acute brain tyrosine depletion on MDMA-induced changes in brain 5-HT. The mechanism by which 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) neurotoxicity has been suggested to involve an acute release of tyrosine and its non-enzymatic conversion to dopamine. To determine whether brain tyrosine availability is important in MDMA-induced neurotoxicity, brain tyrosine was acutely depleted with a tyrosine-free amino acid mixture (1 g/kg intraperitoneal; twice 1 h apart) which was administered prior to an injection of MDMA (12.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal). A small increase in both the hippocampal and striatal tyrosine concentration occurred in control rats treated with MDMA. The tyrosine-free amino acid mixture significantly decreased tyrosine levels by more than 50% in both brain regions 2 h after injection of either MDMA or saline. MDMA significantly reduced brain 5-HT content 2 h later, but this was of a similar magnitude in control and tyrosine-depleted groups. The long-term neurotoxic 5-HT loss in the hippocampus induced two weeks after MDMA administration was unaltered by the tyrosine-free amino acid mixture. Striatal dopamine content was unaffected by acute MDMA in all groups, while the tyrosine-free amino acid mixture given with MDMA significantly decreased striatal dopamine content 2 weeks later. The tyrosine-free amino acid mixture given alone had no affect on rectal body temperature but attenuated the duration of MDMA-induced hyperthermia. The results confirmed the ability of systemic MDMA to acutely increase brain tyrosine content, but also indicated that a marked acute reduction of brain tyrosine does not directly affect either immediate 5-HT release (as measured by tissue depletion) or long-term hippocampal serotonergic neurotoxicity produced by MDMA.

Behavioural and insecticidal effects of organophosphate-, carbamate- and pyrethroid-treated mosquito nets against African malaria vectors. Three insecticides - the pyrethroid deltamethrin, the carbamate carbosulfan and the organophosphate chlorpyrifos-methyl - were tested on mosquito nets in experimental huts to determine their potential for introduction as malaria control measures. Their behavioural effects and efficacy were examined in Anopheles gambiae Giles s.s. (Diptera: Culicidae) and Anopheles funestus Giles s.s. in Muheza, Tanzania, and in Anopheles arabiensis Patton and Culex quinquefasciatus Say in Moshi, Tanzania. A standardized dosage of 25 mg/m(2) plus high dosages of carbosulfan (50 mg/m(2), 100 mg/m(2) and 200 mg/m(2)) and chlorpyrifos-methyl (100 mg/m(2)) were used to compare the three types of insecticide. At 25 mg/m(2), the rank order of the insecticides for insecticide-induced mortality in wild An. gambiae and An. funestus was, respectively, carbosulfan (88%, 86%) > deltamethrin (79%, 78%) > chlorpyrifos-methyl (35%, 53%). The rank order of the insecticides for blood-feeding inhibition (reduction in the number of blood-fed mosquitoes compared with control) in wild An. gambiae and An. funestus was deltamethrin > chlorpyrifos-methyl > carbosulfan. Carbosulfan was particularly toxic to endophilic anophelines at 200 mg/m(2), killing 100% of An. gambiae and 98% of An. funestus that entered the huts. It was less effective against the more exophilic An. arabiensis (67% mortality) and carbamate-resistant Cx quinquefasciatus (36% mortality). Carbosulfan deterred anophelines from entering huts, but did not deter carbamate-resistant Cx quinquefasciatus. Deltamethrin reduced the proportion of insects engaged in blood-feeding, probably as a consequence of contact irritancy, whereas carbosulfan seemed to provide personal protection through deterred entry or perhaps a spatial repellent action. Any deployment of carbosulfan as an individual treatment on nets should be carried out on a large scale to reduce the risk of diverting mosquitoes to unprotected individuals. Chlorpyrifos-methyl was inferior to deltamethrin in terms of mortality and blood-feeding inhibition and would be better deployed on a net in combination with a pyrethroid to control insecticide-resistant mosquitoes.


Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with 27 versus 39 Fr bougie calibration: a randomized controlled trial.

Experimental identification of microRNA targets. microRNAs are small RNAs that regulate protein synthesis post-transcriptionally. Animal microRNAs recognize their targets by incomplete base pairing to sequence motifs most often present in the 3' untranslated region of their target mRNAs. This partial complementarity vastly expands the repertoire of potential targets and constitutes a problem for computational target prediction. Although computational analyses have shed light on important aspects of microRNA target recognition, several questions remain regarding how microRNAs can recognize and regulate their targets. Forward experimental approaches allow for an unbiased study of microRNA target recognition and may unveil novel, rare or uncommon target binding patterns. In this review we focus on animal microRNAs and the experimental approaches that have been described for identification of their targets.

[Drug treatment with fibrinolytics (corrected) of secondary empyema secondary to complicated parapneumonic effusion]. In recent years we have observed in our country an increase in complications associated with bacterial pneumonia, such as pleural effusion and empyema. The initial treatment is an association of antibiotics, covering the potential germ involved, and the placement of a pleural drainage tube, in order to accelerate the resolution process. Formation of septa within the pleural cavity requires additional therapy (antifibrinolytic treatment, videothorascopy), but no one of these two alternatives is been demonstrated better than the other. We present a review that covers last 15 years (1990-2006), related to management of empyema. The management strategy with initial instillation of antifibrinolytic intrapleural makes our series the longest in our country using such treatment (30 of 50 patients reviewed (60) were treated with this technique). Initial success was 96% with this modality, without rescuing surgery. There is also a descriptive analysis of several clinical, laboratory and radiological parameters. In comparative analysis, length of stay in intensive care unit decreases in those patients treated with antifibrinolytics. This result is a prove of the efficacy of this treatment, and quite encourageing.

3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexahydroxystilbene impairs melanoma progression in a metastatic mouse model. Stilbenes comprise a group of polyphenolic compounds, which exert inhibitory effects on various malignancies. The aim of this study was to evaluate the antitumor effects of a previously unreported stilbene derivative-3,3',4,4',5,5'-hexahydroxystilbene, termed M8-on human melanoma cells. Cell-cycle analysis of the metastatic melanoma cell line M24met showed that M8 treatment induces G(2)/M arrest accompanied with a dose- and time-dependent upregulation of p21 and downregulation of CDK-2 and leads to apoptosis. M8 induces the expression of phosphorylated p53, proteins involved in the mismatch repair machinery (MSH6, MSH2, and MLH1) and a robust tail moment in a comet assay. In addition, M8 inhibited cell migration in Matrigel assays. Shotgun proteomics and western analysis showed the regulation among others of paxillin, integrin-linked protein kinase, p21-activated kinase, and ROCK-1 indicating that M8 inhibits mesenchymal and amoeboid cell migration. These in vitro data were confirmed in vivo in a metastatic human melanoma severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mouse model. We showed that M8 significantly impairs tumor growth. M8 also interfered with the metastatic process, as M8 treatment prevented the metastatic spread of melanoma cells to distant lymph nodes in vivo. In summary, M8 exerts strong antitumor effects with the potential to become a new drug for the treatment of metastatic melanoma.

Multilocus microsatellite typing of Leishmania infantum isolates in monitored Leishmania/HIV coinfected patients. Leishmania infantum is the main etiological agent of both visceral and cutaneous clinical forms of leishmaniasis in the Mediterranean area. Leishmania/HIV coinfection in this area is characterized by a chronic course and frequent recurrences of clinical episodes. The present study using Multilocus Microsatellite Typing (MLMT) analysis, a highly discriminative tool, aimed to genetically characterize L. infantum isolates taken from monitored Leishmania/HIV coinfected patients presenting successive clinical episodes. In this study, by the analysis of 20 microsatellite loci, we studied the MLMT profiles of 25âL. infantum isolates from 8 Leishmania/HIV coinfected patients who had experienced several clinical episodes. Two to seven isolates per patient were taken before and after treatment, during clinical and non-clinical episodes, with time intervals of 6Â days to 29Â months. Genetic diversity, clustering and phenetic analyses were performed. MLMT enabled us to study the genetic characteristics of the 25âL. infantum isolates, differentiating 18 genotypes, corresponding to a genotypic diversity of 0.72. Fifteen genotypes were unique in the total sample set and only 3 were repeated, 2 of which were detected in different patients. Both clustering and phylogenetic analyses provided insights into the genetic links between the isolates; in five patients isolates showed clear genetic links: either the genotype was exactly the same or only slightly different. In contrast, the isolates of the other three patients were dispersed in different clusters and some could be the result of mixing between populations. Our data indicated a great MLMT variability between isolates from coinfected patients and no predominant genotype was observed. Despite this, almost all clinical episodes could be interpreted as a relapse rather than a reinfection. The results showed that diverse factors like an intrapatient evolution over time or culture bias could influence the parasite population detected in the patient, making it difficult to differentiate between relapse and reinfection.

Autophagy: a new target for advanced papillary thyroid cancer therapy. Autophagy is a conserved response to stress that facilitates cell survival in some contexts and promotes cell death in others. We sought to characterize autophagy in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and to determine the effects of autophagy inhibition on chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity. The human thyroid papillary carcinoma cell lines TPC-1 and 8505-C were treated with doxorubicin or radiation in the presence or absence of the autophagy-specific inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA). Although light chain 3 (LC3)-II protein levels were undetectable in normal thyroid and PTC specimens at baseline, doxorubicin exposure induced LC3-II expression and the formation of autophagosomes. Both PTC cell lines expressed low levels of LC3-II under standard conditions. Treatment of these cells with doxorubicin strongly induced LC3-II expression and the formation of autophagosomes; however, doxorubicin-mediated induction of LC3-II was abrogated by 3-MA. Moreover, 3-MA significantly increased the doxorubicin IC(50) in both PTC cell lines. Radiation exposure also induced LC3-II expression. Treatment with 3-MA abrogated the radiation-induced increase in LC3-II in both cell lines and reduced radiosensitivity by 49% and 31% in 8505-C and TPC-1 cells, respectively. Autophagy inhibition promotes PTC resistance to doxorubicin and radiation. Therefore, autophagy activation may be a useful adjunct treatment for patients with PTC that is refractory to conventional therapy.

Gold Nanoparticles Promote Oxidant-Mediated Activation of NF-ÎºB and 53BP1 Recruitment-Based Adaptive Response in Human Astrocytes. Nanogold-based materials are promising candidate tools for nanobased medicine. Nevertheless, no conclusive information on their cytotoxicity is available. In the present study, we investigated the effects of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) on human astrocytes in vitro. Nanogold treatment in a wide range of concentrations did not result in cytotoxicity. In contrast, nanogold provoked changes in the astrocyte cell cycle and induced senescence-associated Î²-galactosidase activity. AuNPs promoted oxidative stress and caused activation of NF-ÎºB pathway. After nanogold treatment, an inverse correlation between the formation of 53BP1 foci and micronuclei generation was observed. The robust 53BP1 recruitment resulted in reduced micronuclei production. Thus, nanogold treatment stimulated an adaptive response in a human astrocyte cell. 

[Selective pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone in a patient treated with amiodarone]. Selective pituitary resistance to thyroid hormones is a syndrome that involves inadequate response of thyroid-stimulating hormone to changes in thyroid hormones. Unlike generalized resistance syndromes, this entity produces central hyperthyroidism and clinical thyrotoxicosis. Sometimes the disease may not be properly diagnosed and is treated with drugs with harmful effects on the thyroid, such as amiodarone, hampering diagnosis and possibly exacerbating the disorder. The treatment of this condition can be symptomatic, based on control of tachycardia and anxiety, or etiological, acting on the pituitary to regulate thyrotropin secretion or on the thyroid gland to control thyroid hormone production. We report the case of a patient with pituitary resistance to thyroid hormone, who was treated with amiodarone to control paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.

MLVA as an Epidemiological Tool To Trace Back Brucella melitensis Biovar 1 Re-Emergence in Italy. Brucellosis is an important zoonosis caused by Brucella spp., still prevalent in most areas of the world. Brucellosis control in animals is the key to protect humans. The knowledge of Brucella spp. prevailing genotypes in a territory represents an important epidemiological tool to formulate policies and strategies for disease control and to trace back the introduction of new strains previously considered as exotic. In the last years, multiple-locus variable number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA) has been proposed as complementary to classical biotyping methods. MLVA may add important information to the classical epidemiological investigation techniques, to help in tracing back sources of infection in brucellosis outbreaks. Sardinia is an Italian region officially free from sheep and goats brucellosis since 1998. In 2011, Brucella melitensis biovar 1, a biotype not reported in Italy since 1995, was isolated in one flock in the region. The genotyping MLVA-16 showed that isolates belonged to a rare American lineage, confirming it was introduced from other countries. The strain was considered as probably originating from Spain, where this lineage is endemic. BrucellaMLVA-16 has been proved to be useful to analyse the epidemiological correlation of strains enabling to trace its geographic origin by comparing their previously reported genetic patterns.

Pharmacological effects of Catharanthus roseus root alkaloids in acetylcholinesterase inhibition and cholinergic neurotransmission. The leaves of Catharanthus roseus constitute the only source of the well known indolomonoterpenic alkaloids vincristine and vinblastine. In this work we studied the biological potential of the roots, which are used in several countries as decocts or hot water extracts for the treatment of a number of conditions. The aqueous extract strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AchE) in an in vitro microassay, an effect ascribable mainly to serpentine (IC(50) = 0.775 microM vs physostigmine IC(50) = 6.45 microM) as assessed with the pure compound. Pure alkaloids were tested for muscarinic and nicotinic antagonism using rat ex-vivo preparations, namely, ileum and diaphragm/phrenic-nerve, respectively. Serpentine competitively blocked muscarinic receptors with a pA(2) of 5.2, whereas the precursor ajmalicine up to 80 microM was undistinguishable from control, and catharanthine exhibited an unsurmountable muscarinic antagonism at greater than 10 microM concentrations. Nicotinic receptor mediated diaphragm contractions were fully inhibited by catharanthine (IC(50) = 59.6 microM) and ajmalicine (IC(50) = 72.3 microM), in a reversible but non-competitive manner, unlike the more potent nicotinic antagonist tubocurarine (IC(50) = 0.35 microM) whose competitive blockade was overcome by a physostigmine-induced increase in acetylcholine. Serpentine up to 100 microM did not change diaphragm contractions suggesting reduced affinity for neuromuscular nicotinic receptors. Despite strong in vitro AchE inhibition, serpentine failed to restore diaphragm contractions upon submaximal tubocurarine blockade, suggesting that poor tissue penetration may prevent serpentine from inhibiting AchE in deep neuromuscular synapses in the ex-vivo preparation. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to assess the effect of C. roseus root extracts, as well as of serpentine, ajmalicine and catharanthine on AchE. The results described herein suggest that the currently overlooked C. roseus roots may constitute a promising source of compounds with pharmaceutical interest. Moreover, given serpentine's potent in vitro AchE inhibitory activity and low cholinergic receptor affinity, it is conceivable that minor structural modifications may yield a potent and selective AchE inhibitor, potentially useful for the pharmacological management of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and/or myasthenia gravis.

Restoration of muscle functionality by genetic suppression of glycogen synthesis in a murine model of Pompe disease. Glycogen storage disease type II (GSDII) or Pompe disease is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) deficiency, leading to lysosomal glycogen accumulation. Affected individuals store glycogen mainly in cardiac and skeletal muscle tissues resulting in fatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and respiratory failure in the most severe infantile form. Enzyme replacement therapy has already proved some efficacy, but results remain variable especially in skeletal muscle. Substrate reduction therapy was successfully used to improve the phenotype in several lysosomal storage disorders. We have recently demonstrated that shRNA-mediated reduction of glycogen synthesis led to a significant reduction of glycogen accumulation in skeletal muscle of GSDII mice. In this paper, we analyzed the effect of a complete genetic elimination of glycogen synthesis in the same GSDII model. GAA and glycogen synthase 1 (GYS1) KO mice were inter-crossed to generate a new double-KO model. GAA/GYS1-KO mice exhibited a profound reduction of the amount of glycogen in the heart and skeletal muscles, a significant decrease in lysosomal swelling and autophagic build-up as well as a complete correction of cardiomegaly. In addition, the abnormalities in glucose metabolism and insulin tolerance observed in the GSDII model were corrected in double-KO mice. Muscle atrophy observed in 11-month-old GSDII mice was less pronounced in GAA/GYS1-KO mice, resulting in improved exercise capacity. These data demonstrate that long-term elimination of muscle glycogen synthesis leads to a significant improvement of structural, metabolic and functional defects in GSDII mice and offers a new perspective for the treatment of Pompe disease.

Inhibition of HIV-1 integrase nuclear import and replication by a peptide bearing integrase putative nuclear localization signal. The integrase (IN) of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has been implicated in different steps during viral replication, including nuclear import of the viral pre-integration complex. The exact mechanisms underlying the nuclear import of IN and especially the question of whether it bears a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) remain controversial. Here, we studied the nuclear import pathway of IN by using multiple in vivo and in vitro systems. Nuclear import was not observed in an importin alpha temperature-sensitive yeast mutant, indicating an importin alpha-mediated process. Direct interaction between the full-length IN and importin alpha was demonstrated in vivo using bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay (BiFC). Nuclear import studies in yeast cells, with permeabilized mammalian cells, or microinjected cultured mammalian cells strongly suggest that the IN bears a NLS domain located between residues 161 and 173. A peptide bearing this sequence -NLS-IN peptide- inhibited nuclear accumulation of IN in transfected cell-cycle arrested cells. Integration of viral cDNA as well as HIV-1 replication in viral cell-cycle arrested infected cells were blocked by the NLS-IN peptide. Our present findings support the view that nuclear import of IN occurs via the importin alpha pathway and is promoted by a specific NLS domain. This import could be blocked by NLS-IN peptide, resulting in inhibition of viral infection, confirming the view that nuclear import of the viral pre-integration complex is mediated by viral IN.

Bioelectrochemical ethanol production through mediated acetate reduction by mixed cultures. Biological acetate reduction with hydrogen is a potential method to convert wet biomass waste into ethanol. Since the ethanol concentration and reaction rates are low, this research studies the feasibility of using an electrode, in stead of hydrogen, as an electron donor for biological acetate reduction in conjunction of an electron mediator. Initially, the effect of three selected mediators on metabolic flows during acetate reduction with hydrogen was explored; subsequently, the best performing mediator was used in a bioelectrochemical system to stimulate acetate reduction at the cathode with mixed cultures at an applied cathode potential of -550 mV. In the batch test, methyl viologen (MV) was found to accelerate ethanol production 6-fold and increased ethanol concentration 2-fold to 13.5 +/- 0.7 mM compared to the control. Additionally, MV inhibited n-butyrate and methane formation, resulting in high ethanol production efficiency (74.6 +/- 6%). In the bioelectrochemical system, MV addition to an inoculated cathode led directly to ethanol production (1.82 mM). Hydrogen was coproduced at the cathode (0.0035 Nm(3) hydrogen m(-2) d(-1)), so it remained unclear whether acetate was reduced to ethanol by electrons supplied by the mediator or by hydrogen. As MV reacted irreversibly at the cathode, ethanol production stopped after 5 days.

Researcher judgment and study design: challenges of using administrative data. Questions have been raised about methods of studies finding substantial undercounting of workplace injuries and illnesses by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and workers' compensation agencies. A more recent study of Minnesota concluded that the BLS survey captures 84-90% of workers' compensation cases. We examined the sensitivity of findings in two studies to alternate sample definitions and study assumptions. Applying alternate sample construction rules to the earlier study increased estimated BLS reporting rates from 68% to 77%, assuming source independence. Applying alternate assumptions to the more recent Minnesota study reduced its high estimate of BLS reporting from 90% to 53-64%. Studies linking administrative data from different sources require substantial judgment in constructing research datasets and choosing analytic methods. Moreover, different sample construction rules lead to different results. This suggests that sensitivity analysis should be carried out when alternatives cannot be ruled out. In this case, sensitivity analysis supports the hypothesis of substantial underreporting.

[Growth peculiarities and properties of Bacillus subtilis IMV B-7023 cell surface in the medium with glycerophosphate]. It is established that, depending on the amount of the basic elements of carbon and phosphorus nutrition in the cultivation medium, Bacillus subtilis IMV B-7023 can use glycerophosphate as a source of carbon, carbon and phosphorus, or phosphorus. The found differences in bacterium physiology correlate with the change of cell surface properties.

A new model calculation of the peak efficiency for HPGe detectors used in assays of radioactive waste drums. In this paper we present a new semi-empirical model calculation of the peak efficiency for unshielded HPGe detectors based on the virtual point detector and the attenuation factor concepts. The validity of the model calculation was checked by comparison with Monte Carlo efficiency values and experimental efficiencies determined for a HPGe detector type GEM 25P4 using a calibration drum. The discrepancy between experimental and calculated efficiencies is smaller than 10% in the energy range 122-1408 keV.

Cellular mechanisms of IL-17-induced blood-brain barrier disruption. Recently T-helper 17 (Th17) cells were demonstrated to disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) by the action of IL-17A. The aim of the present study was to examine the mechanisms that underlie IL-17A-induced BBB breakdown. Barrier integrity was analyzed in the murine brain endothelial cell line bEnd.3 by measuring the electrical resistance values using electrical call impedance sensing technology. Furthermore, in-cell Western blots, fluorescence imaging, and monocyte adhesion and transendothelial migration assays were performed. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) was induced in C57BL/6 mice. IL-17A induced NADPH oxidase- or xanthine oxidase-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The resulting oxidative stress activated the endothelial contractile machinery, which was accompanied by a down-regulation of the tight junction molecule occludin. Blocking either ROS formation or myosin light chain phosphorylation or applying IL-17A-neutralizing antibodies prevented IL-17A-induced BBB disruption. Treatment of mice with EAE using ML-7, an inhibitor of the myosin light chain kinase, resulted in less BBB disruption at the spinal cord and less infiltration of lymphocytes via the BBB and subsequently reduced the clinical characteristics of EAE. These observations indicate that IL-17A accounts for a crucial step in the development of EAE by impairing the integrity of the BBB, involving augmented production of ROS.-Huppert, J., Closhen, D., Croxford, A., White, R., Kulig, P., Pietrowski, E., Bechmann, I., Becher, B., Luhmann, H.

Intestinal and blood-brain barrier permeability of ginkgolides and bilobalide: in vitro and in vivo approaches. In this study intestinal and blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability of ginkgolides A, B, C, J and bilobalide, isolated from Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgoaceae), was evaluated in Caco-2 and MDR1-MDCK cell monolayer models. The transport was examined for 2 hours in both absorptive and secretory directions. Quantitation was performed by UPLC-MS. In the Caco-2 model, each compound (100 microM) displayed a pH-dependent transport in the absorptive direction. A low permeability of ginkgolides was observed across the MDR1-MDCK model in the absorptive direction. An efflux was observed for all compounds in both the models. The efflux ratio was much higher in the MDR1-MDCK cell model (> 10) compared to the Caco-2 cell model (1.5-3.6). In comparison to ginkgolides, the permeability of bilobalide was much higher across the Caco-2 monolayer in both directions. However, a poor transport of bilobalide was observed in the MDR1-MDCK model in the absorptive direction. A high efflux was observed for all compounds in the mixture form as compared to their isolated forms. In rats, a single dose of bilobalide (8 mg/kg) administered intravenously resulted in a significant level of bilobalide in both plasma and brain. A brain-to-plasma partition coefficient of 0.56 at 120 min indicated its possibility of brain uptake.

ADHD and growth: anthropometric changes in medicated and non-medicated ADHD boys. ADHD children can show changes in growth and development. Many studies describe these changes as a side effect of stimulant medication. However, changes in somatic development can also appear in non-medicated children. This suggests that the changes could be a manifestation of the disorder itself and not just a side effect of the treatment. This study compared anthropometric characteristics in medicated and non-medicated ADHD boys (n=104, age 4-16 years) with the normal non-clinical population. In contrast to most previous studies, complex anthropometrical measurements were used. The results showed significant differences between children with ADHD and those without the diagnosis, the differences found to be statistically significant (p<0.01) being signs of nutrition (percentage of fat, abdominal circumference) and growth suppression (lower body height, smaller head circumference). Differences between the medicated and non-medicated groups corresponded only to a lower value of body fat in the medicated children. These results suggest that growth changes in ADHD children may be more specific to the disorder itself than to stimulant treatment.

The morphology of acute disc herniation: a clinically relevant model defining the role of flexion. Hydrostatically induced disruption of flexed lumbar intervertebral discs followed by microstructural investigation. To investigate how flexion affects the anulus' ability to resist rupture during hydrostatic loading, and determine how the characteristics of the resulting disc failures compare with those observed clinically. While compression of neutrally positioned motion segments consistently causes vertebral failure, compression of flexed segments can induce herniation. Why flexion has this effect remains unclear. A vast range of herniation characteristics have been documented clinically; whether flexion-related herniations are likely to possess a subset of these is unknown. Forty-two ovine lumbar motion segments, dissected from the same 3 levels of 14 spines, were each flexed 7 degrees or 10 degrees from the neutral position. While maintained at one of these angles, the nucleus of each segment was gradually injected with a viscous radio-opaque gel via an injection screw placed longitudinally within the inferior vertebra, until failure occurred. Each segment was then inspected using microcomputed tomography and oblique illumination microscopy in tandem. RESULTS.: Eighteen segments suffered disc failure; 14 of these were caused by direct radial rupture of the anular wall. All radial ruptures were located in the central posterior anulus. Nine radial ruptures contained nuclear material, which had breached the posterior longitudinal ligament in 1 disc, and reached it in 5 others forming transligamentous and subligamentous nuclear extrusions, respectively. The most common radial rupture route, occurring in 10 discs, involved a systematic anulus-endplate-anulus failure pattern. Flexion places the anulus at risk by facilitating nuclear flow, limiting circumferential disruption while promoting radial rupture, and rendering the endplate/vertebra junction vulnerable to failure. Flexion may play a developmental role in those herniations possessing a central posterior radial rupture that incorporates a short span of endplate disruption along the apex of the vertebral rim.

Identification and comparison of Mycobacterium leprae genotypes in two geographical regions of Colombia. To evaluate and establish genomic strain typing markers suitable for the identification of transmission patterns of leprosy in different regions of Colombia. Patients from Agua de Dios, Barranquilla and Cartagena cities and neighbouring towns were enrolled during 2006-2007. Slit skin smears or biopsies were obtained from newly detected untreated patients, and those undergoing multidrug therapy. DNA was extracted from the clinical samples and tested using 15 different short tandem repeat and three SNP polymorphic markers. Differences or similarities between strain types from the northeast (n = 20) and central regions of Colombia (n = 18) were noted. The alleles at two loci, 27-5 and 12-5 were different in the M. leprae in the two regions. The other microsatellite loci may be useful for further intra-population differentiation. There was strong association of 27-5 and 12-5 alleles with the SNP types. The 4-5 combination of alleles was associated with SNP type 3, while the 5-4 combination was mostly associated with SNP type 1, 2 or 4. The SNP type 4 m. leprae isolates were seen in patients in the northeast, but not in the central part.

[The value of regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted in the pathogenesis of varicose ulcer of lower limbs]. To study the effectiveness of RANTES in the pathogenesis of venous ulceration. 40 Chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) individuals were enrolled in the study and separated into the ulceration group (n=20) and non-ulceration group (n=20), according to CVI with or without ulceration, 10 healthy individuals were enrolled as control group. The expression of RANTES mRNA was analyzed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in blood. Immunohistochemical staining of RANTES were carried in normal skin, in the tissue at the brim of ulceration and in the tissue of cured or curing ulceration. In ulceration group, the expression of RANTES mRNA in blood increased obviously. Compared with the other two groups, they were significant different (P < 0.05). The difference was also significance in the other two groups (P < 0.05). The average number of RANTES positive expression in normal skin is 28 +/- 13, in the tissue at the brim of ulceration is 107 +/- 44, and in the tissue of cured or curing ulceration is 35 +/- 20. There are significant difference between normal skin and the tissue at the brim of ulceration (P < 0.05). The average number of RANTES positive expression in the tissue of cured or curing ulceration is lower than that's in the tissue at the brim of ulceration. The high expression of RANTES may be one of the important mechanisms of varicose ulcer.

Costs by industry and diagnosis among musculoskeletal claims in a state workers compensation system: 1999-2004. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a tremendous burden on industry in the United States. However, there is limited understanding of the unique issues relating to specific industry sectors, specifically the frequency and costs of different MSDs. Claim data from 1999 to 2004 from the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation were analyzed as a function of industry sector (NAICS industry-sector categories) and anatomical region (ICD-9 codes). Almost 50% of the claims were lumbar spine (26.9%) or hand/wrist (21.7%). The majority of claims were from manufacturing (25.1%) and service (32.8%) industries. The industries with the highest average costs per claim were transportation, warehouse, and utilities and construction. Across industries, the highest costs per claim were consistently for the lumbar spine, shoulder, and cervical spine body regions. This study provides insight into the severity (i.e., medical and indemnity costs) of MSDs across multiple industries, providing data for prioritizing of resources for research and interventions.

Alterations of the CD58 gene in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. Immune evasion plays a central role in the pathophysiology of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). As mutations of the CD58 gene contribute to immune evasion of diffuse large B cell lymphoma tumor cells, we studied whether alterations of the CD58 gene also occur in Hodgkin and Reed/Sternberg (HRS) cells of cHL. Single nucleotide polymorphism chip analysis revealed homozygous deletions within the CD58 gene in two cHL cell lines (SUP-HD1 and U-HO1). Sequencing of the CD58 gene in seven cHL cell lines disclosed in addition a homozygous splice site mutation in cell line KM-H2. None of the three mutated lines expressed CD58 protein on their surface. Thus, three of seven cHL cell lines analyzed harbor destructive CD58 mutations. Molecular analysis of isolated HRS cells from 10 primary cases of cHL; however, did not reveal any case with a CD58 mutation. A FICTION study indicated heterozygous deletions of CD58 in 3 of 13 cHL analyzed. Overall, we report frequent inactivating mutations of CD58 in cHL cell lines, but their rare occurrence in primary HRS cells. As the three cHL cell lines with CD58 mutations were all established from HRS cells located in pleural effusions, i.e., outside the normal lymph node microenvironment, in end-stages of the disease, CD58 inactivation in cHL might be predominantly prevalent to such situations.

[Patterning different cells based on microfluidics and self-assembled monolayers]. The ability to pattern multiple cells through precise surface engineering of cell culture substrates has promoted the development of cellular bioassays, such as differentiation, interaction and molecular signaling pathways. There are several well developed ways to pattern cells. This report describes a method for patterning multiple types of cells based on microfluidics and self-assembled monolayers. We developed two types of micro-dam structures by soft-lithography to locate cells precisely and modified the substrate by a kind of self-assembled monolayer with property of electrochemical desorption to confine cells in specific areas. Finally we could pattern an array of two different types of cells closely and precisely. Cells were confined in specific areas but still shared the same microenvironment, so they could interact through soluble molecules. The substrate was transparent and open, so we could easily apply several instruments for research. With these merits, this cell chip is appropriate for investigating the interaction between different types of cells.

[Effects of nitrogen addition on grassland species diversity and productivity in Keerqin Sandy Land]. Species diversity and productivity are the important indices of the structure and functioning of ecosystems. With Keerqin sandy grassland as test object, this paper studied its species composition, species diversity, and productivity under effects of different level nitrogen (N) addition. Nitrogen addition altered the species composition and the dominant species in the community, increased the vegetation height and coverage, and decreased vegetation light penetration. With the increase of N addition, both the species richness and the diversity decreased. Nitrogen addition increased the aboveground biomass significantly (P<0.01). There was a significant positive relationship between species richness and vegetation light penetration (P<0.01), and a significant negative relationship between species richness and vegetation coverage (P<0.01). It was suggested that nitrogen deposition and artificial nitrogen addition would affect the species composition, species diversity, and productivity of sandy grassland ecosystem.

Toward reconstructing the evolution of advanced moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera: Ditrysia): an initial molecular study. In the mega-diverse insect order Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths; 165,000 described species), deeper relationships are little understood within the clade Ditrysia, to which 98% of the species belong. To begin addressing this problem, we tested the ability of five protein-coding nuclear genes (6.7 kb total), and character subsets therein, to resolve relationships among 123 species representing 27 (of 33) superfamilies and 55 (of 100) families of Ditrysia under maximum likelihood analysis. Our trees show broad concordance with previous morphological hypotheses of ditrysian phylogeny, although most relationships among superfamilies are weakly supported. There are also notable surprises, such as a consistently closer relationship of Pyraloidea than of butterflies to most Macrolepidoptera. Monophyly is significantly rejected by one or more character sets for the putative clades Macrolepidoptera as currently defined (P < 0.05) and Macrolepidoptera excluding Noctuoidea and Bombycoidea sensu lato (P < or = 0.005), and nearly so for the superfamily Drepanoidea as currently defined (P < 0.08). Superfamilies are typically recovered or nearly so, but usually without strong support. Relationships within superfamilies and families, however, are often robustly resolved. We provide some of the first strong molecular evidence on deeper splits within Pyraloidea, Tortricoidea, Geometroidea, Noctuoidea and others.Separate analyses of mostly synonymous versus non-synonymous character sets revealed notable differences (though not strong conflict), including a marked influence of compositional heterogeneity on apparent signal in the third codon position (nt3). As available model partitioning methods cannot correct for this variation, we assessed overall phylogeny resolution through separate examination of trees from each character set. Exploration of "tree space" with GARLI, using grid computing, showed that hundreds of searches are typically needed to find the best-feasible phylogeny estimate for these data. Our results (a) corroborate the broad outlines of the current working phylogenetic hypothesis for Ditrysia, (b) demonstrate that some prominent features of that hypothesis, including the position of the butterflies, need revision, and (c) resolve the majority of family and subfamily relationships within superfamilies as thus far sampled. Much further gene and taxon sampling will be needed, however, to strongly resolve individual deeper nodes.


Association of physical activity level with depression, anxiety, and quality of life in children with type 1 diabetes mellitus.

Molecular, morphological, and cytological analysis of diverse Brachypodium distachyon inbred lines. Brachypodium distachyon (brachypodium) is a small grass with the biological and genomic attributes necessary to serve as a model system for all grasses including small grains and grasses being developed as energy crops (e.g., switchgrass and Miscanthus). To add natural variation to the toolkit available to plant biologists using brachypodium as a model system, it is imperative to establish extensive, well-characterized germplasm collections. The objectives of this study were to collect brachypodium accessions from throughout Turkey and then characterize the molecular (nuclear and organelle genome), morphological, and cytological variation within the collection. We collected 164 lines from 45 diverse geographic regions of Turkey and created 146 inbred lines. The majority of this material (116 of 146 inbred lines) was diploid. The similarity matrix for the diploid lines based on AFLP analysis indicated extensive diversity, with genetic distances ranging from 0.05 to 0.78. Organelle genome diversity, on the other hand, was low both among and within the lines used in this study. The geographic distribution of genotypes was not significantly correlated with either nuclear or organelle genome variation for the genotypes studied. Phenotypic characterization of the lines showed extensive variation in flowering time (7-22 weeks), seed production (4-193 seeds/plant), and biomass (15-77 g). Chromosome morphology of the collected brachypodium accessions varied from submetacentric to metacentric, except for chromosome 5, which was acrocentric. The diverse brachypodium lines developed in this study will allow experimental approaches dependent upon natural variation to be applied to this new model grass. These results will also help efforts to have a better understanding of complex large genomes (i.e., wheat, barley, and switchgrass).

Emergence of resistance to third-generation cephalosporin in Shigella--a case report. The emergence of ciprofloxacin resistance in Shigella has shifted the attention to cephalosporins. The first occurrence of third generation cephalosporin-resistant Shigella flexneri was from France. This article reports the first case of cephalosporin-resistant S. flexneri from India. A 12-month-old child was admitted for a 20-day episode of loose stools, non-fetid, with mucus and blood. The stool sample showed the presence of blood and mucus and S. flexneri which was resistant to Ampicillin, Nalidixic acid, Ciprofloxacin, Furoxone, Ceftriaxone and sensitive only to Cefoperazone and sulbactam combination. The child was promptly admitted and treated with a combination of Cefoperazone and sulbactam. The use of this combination was met with success in the present case, and may be considered as a temporary answer to the emerging cephalosporin-resistance.

ATP Hydrolysis in the RecA-DNA Filament Promotes Structural Changes at the Protein-DNA Interface. To address the mechanistic roles of ATP hydrolysis in RecA-promoted strand exchange reaction in homologous recombination, quantum mechanical calculations are performed on key parts of the RecA-DNA complex. We find that ATP hydrolysis may induce changes at the protein-DNA interface, resulting in the rearrangement of the hydrogen bond network connecting the ATP and the DNA binding sites.

Molecular cloning and expression of two HSP70 genes in the Wuchang bream (Megalobrama amblycephala Yih). Two complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) clones encoding heat shock cognate 70 (HSC70) and inducible heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) were isolated from the liver of Wuchang bream (Megalobrama amblycephala Y.) using RT-PCR and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). They were named Ma-HSC70 and Ma-HSP70, respectively. The cDNAs were 2336 and 2224 bp in length [not including poly (A)] and contained 1950 and 1932 bp open reading frames (ORFs), respectively. The ORFs encoded proteins of 649 and 643 amino acids with predicted molecular weights of 71.24 and 70.52 kDa, and theoretical isoelectric points of 5.25 and 5.30, respectively. Genomic DNA structure analysis revealed that Ma-HSC70 gene contained seven introns with all introns conforming to the GT/AG rule whereas Ma-HSP70 gene did not contain any intron in the coding region. Amino acid sequence analysis indicated that both Ma-HSC70 and Ma-HSP70 contained three signature sequences of HSP70 family, two partial overlapping bipartite nuclear localization signal sequences (NLS) and cytoplasmic characteristic motif (EEVD). Homology analysis revealed that Ma-HSC70 shared more than 93.0% identity with the known HSC70s of other vertebrates, while Ma-HSP70 shared more than 85.0% identity with the known HSP70s of other vertebrates, and Ma-HSC70 and Ma-HSP70 shared 86.5% identity. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that the proteins encoded by Ma-HSC70 and Ma-HSP70 genes were hydrophilic, rich in B cells antigenic sites, without any signal peptide or transmembrane region. The two proteins also contained many protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, N-myristoylation sites, casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, and N-glycosylation sites, predicting that they could play essential roles in protein folding, translocation, intracellular localization, signal transduction and regulation. The predominant secondary structures of the two proteins were alpha-helix and random coil. Fluorescent real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to study the effects of heat shock (34 degrees C), crowding stress (100g L(-1)) and challenge with bacteria Aeromonas hydrophila on the mRNA expression of the two HSP70s in Wuchang bream liver. The results indicated that, during 24 h stress, Ma-HSC70 mRNA expression decreased at first and then rose to the level before stress under heat shock and crowding stress, but Ma-HSP70 mRNA expression increased at first and then decreased under heat stress, and appeared to increase continuously under crowding stress. After bacterial challenge, the mRNA levels of both Ma-HSC70 and Ma-HSP70 increased at first and then decreased. The cloning and expression analysis of the two HSP70s provide theoretical basis to further study the mechanism of anti-adverseness and expression characteristics under stress conditions of Wuchang bream.

A passive apparatus for controlled-flux delivery of biocides: hydrogen peroxide as an example. A new test method has been developed to estimate the required release rate of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to prevent marine biofouling. The technique exploits a well-defined concentration gradient of biocide across a cellulose acetate membrane. A controlled flux of H2O2, an environmentally friendly biocide, was obtained. Larvae of the barnacle, Balanus improvisus, were subjected to known release rates of H2O2 from a surface, under laboratory conditions. It was found that the distribution of settled larvae was not significantly different from the controls when H2O2 fluxes of 5-8 microg cm(-2) day(-1) were applied. However, release rates of 40 microg cm(-2) day(-1) significantly displaced the distribution of settled larvae towards the area of the chamber farthest away from the membrane. Membrane tests in seawater (Jyllinge Harbour, Denmark) for over 16 weeks showed that release rates of H2O2 of approximately 2800 microg cm(-2) day(-1) deterred biofouling efficiently. A H2O2 release rate of about 224 microg cm(-2) day(-1) resulted in some slime formation, but it was less than that on the H2O2-free control. It appears that to obtain efficient resistance to biofouling in natural seawater requires much higher membrane release rates of H2O2 (factor of between 5 and 50) than laboratory membrane exposure assays using barnacle larvae.


Spina bifida and mobility in the transition years.

The role of photodynamic therapy in the esophagus. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a drug and device therapy using photosensitizer drugs activated by laser light for mucosal ablation. Porfimer sodium PDT has been used extensively with proven long-term efficacy and durability for the ablation of Barrett esophagus and high-grade dysplasia. and early esophageal adenocarcinoma. However, continued use is hampered by an associated stricture risk and prolonged photosensitivity (4-6 weeks). Promising single-center European studies using other forms of PDT, such as aminolevulinic acid PDT, have not been replicated elsewhere, limiting the widespread use of other forms of PDT. Future use of PDT in esophageal disease depends on the development of improved dosimetry and patient selection to optimize treatment outcomes, while minimizing adverse events and complications.

Increasing contribution of China in modern biomedical research. Statistical data from ISI Web of Knowledge. China is one of the most rapidly developing countries with a huge population spreading on a chaotic area. For centuries Chinese medicine was based on tradition, religion and experience. However, the last two decades under the pressure of globalization Chinese medicine is turning gradually to evidence-based medicine, contributing in international biomedical research. A bibliometric analysis through the ISI Web of Knowledge was performed. We collected data regarding the amount of Chinese publications in different biomedical fields, the presence of Chinese authors in high impact international journals, the contribution of China's universities in research and finally the number and the quality of local Chinese journals, which have entered the ISI database. According to ISI database a significant increase occurred in both the quantity and quality of the Chinese biomedical publishing activity. This was indicated by the major rise in the amount of published papers, the average augmentation of citations per paper and the constantly increasing presence of Chinese researchers in top medical journals. Chinese institutions appeared also more productive and local journals gained more representation in the ISI database. China's contribution in biomedical research really blossomed after 1990 and especially after 2000. The extent of this contribution may not be proportional to the total research activity performed in China, but it is this part of knowledge that becomes exported and interacts with the rest of the international research activity, promoting research potential in biomedicine.

Use of three evidence-based postoperative pain assessment practices by registered nurses. To provide optimal postoperative pain relief, nursing practice should be based on the best evidence available. For over 20 years, results of studies regarding nurses' use of evidence-based practices, including postoperative pain assessment practices, have shown that nurses use the practices inconsistently. The present cross-sectional survey study was conducted to: 1) determine the extent to which registered nurses caring for postoperative patients experiencing pain used three evidence-based postoperative pain assessment practices; and 2) identify relationships among the level of adoption of evidence-based postoperative pain assessment practices and selected characteristics of registered nurses. Data were collected from a convenience sample of all nurses caring for adult postoperative patients in two Midwestern hospitals where 443 surveys (46.9%) were returned. Respondents were aware of, but not using, three evidence-based postoperative pain assessment practices consistently. Registered nurses who used multiple sources to identify solutions to clinical practice problems or read one or two professional journals regularly were more likely to have adopted the three evidence-based postoperative pain assessment practices. Registered nurses need to be encouraged to use multiple sources to identify solutions to clinical practice problems, including professional nursing journals. Innovative approaches to promote the application of research to education and practice settings are needed. It is important to identify opinion leaders, because opinion leaders are an important resource in overcoming the barriers so that adoption of pain of evidence-based postoperative pain assessment practices can proceed. Additional research is needed to identify what variables effect the adoption of evidence-based practices and identify interventions to improve the level of adoption.

Non-invasive assessment and clinical strategy of stable coronary artery disease by magnetic resonance imaging, multislice computed tomography and myocardial perfusion SPECT. Coronary multislice computed tomography (MSCT) angiography and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) have emerged as new diagnostic techniques that allow direct visualization of the coronary artery. These new modalities have both advantages and disadvantages concerning radiation exposure, the use of contrast medium, ability of visualizing heavily calcified artery lumens, and spatial and temporal resolution. However, these modalities only provide anatomical information of the coronary artery. Functional assessment of the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD) is essential for the management of patients with known or suspected CAD in practical clinical settings.

Neonatal psoas abscess simulating septic arthritis of the hip: a case report and review of the literature.

Feasibility and reproducibility of ShearWave(TM) elastography of fetal baboon organs. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility and reproducibility of transabdominal ShearWave(TM) elastography of fetal organs in pregnant baboons. Fetal ultrasounds of all pregnant baboons in a single primate research center were performed prospectively during 9âmonths. The visualization of fetal targeted organs (liver, proximal and distal lungs, brain white matter and periventricular gray matter) was initially performed using 2D ultrasound, and then elastography mode was activated. For each organ, three measurements were carried out by two operators. Intra-observer and inter-observer intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated. During the study period (03/2013-12/2013), 21 pregnant baboons (21 fetuses) were included. One to three ultrasound scans were performed for each fetus. The measurements were feasible by the two operators in all cases. The intra-observer and inter-observer ICC were 0.654, 95% CI (0.606 to 0.699) and 0.645, 95% CI (0.553 to 0.721) respectively. Transabdominal ShearWave(TM) Elastography of fetal organs can be achieved in pregnant baboons. The intra-observer and inter-observer reproducibility is correct but vary according to the targeted organs.

[Global and local processing in vision: perspectives from comparative cognition]. Primates and birds are visually dominant species. Recent comparative studies in visual perception address questions about the differences between humans and nonhuman primates, as well as primates and birds. This paper discusses the relative importance of global and local visual processing in primates and birds. Although most nonhuman animals, unlike humans, show a local advantage when processing hierarchical compounding stimuli, studies using other types of stimuli revealed that primate vision may process-global information prior to local information. In contrast, the importance of global processing for birds is restricted for ecologically important stimuli such as conspecific images. Both global and local precedence in vision are the result of animals'equally successful adaptations to their living environments, implying that global-oriented human vision is not the only best system.

Survival benefit of non-curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer patients with synchronous distant metastasis.

Robot-assisted laparoscopic nephrectomy and contralateral ureteral reimplantation in children. Robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery (RALS) has expanded the role for minimally invasive surgery within pediatrics. RALS may be particularly beneficial for the treatment of children with a refluxing nonfunctioning renal moiety and contralateral vesicoureteral reflux. In this report, we describe a single RALS procedure, which includes both nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy, and contralateral extravesical ureteral reimplantation (EVUR). A retrospective review was performed of four patients who underwent RALS nephrectomy/partial nephrectomy and concurrent EVUR in one setting. Procedures were performed by a single surgeon using a robot-assisted laparoscopic approach. Four ports were used in a transperitoneal approach with patient positioning changed without moving the robotic system between the nephrectomy and reimplant. We described the technique and assessed its safety and efficacy. All cases were treated with the single RALS approach. Mean patient age was 2.3 years. Three patients underwent a nephrectomy and one a lower pole partial nephrectomy. The mean estimated blood loss was 16 mL, mean operative time was 291 minutes, and mean length of stay was 2.3 days. There was one case of postoperative ureteral obstruction that was treated with 3 weeks of ureteral stenting without further sequela. Overall, the mean follow-up time was 21 months and follow-up renal ultrasonographs and radionuclide cystograms were normal in all patients. A single RALS procedure that combines nephrectomy/partial nephrectomy and EVUR offers a novel approach to a clinical dilemma that often requires two operations. In this small series, RALS was safe and efficacious. We recommend routine Double-J stenting for the solitary reimplanted ureter.


Generation of lentivirus-induced dendritic cells under GMP-compliant conditions for adaptive immune reconstitution against cytomegalovirus after stem cell transplantation.

Change in health-related quality of life as a predictor of mortality in the older adults. We examined whether changes in health-related quality of life (HRQL) predict subsequent mortality among the Spanish elderly. Prospective cohort study of 2,373 persons, representative of the Spanish population aged 60 and older. HRQL was measured in 2001 and 2003 using the SF-36 health questionnaire. Cox regression models were used to examine the association of changes in the physical and mental component summary (PCS and MCS) scores of HRQL from 2001 to 2003 with all-cause mortality through 2007. Two hundred twelve deaths were ascertained from 2003 to 2007. The hazard ratios for mortality across categories of PCS change were as follows: 2.12 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39-3.24) for a > 10-point decline; 1.51 (1.01-2.28) for a 6- to 10-point decline; 1 for the reference category, a change of -5 to +5 points; 0.83 (0.51-1.34) for a 6- to 9-point improvement and 0.68 (0.42-1.09) for a > 10-point improvement; P for linear trend <0.001. The associations between changes in the MCS and mortality showed the same direction, but were of a lower magnitude and attained statistical significance (P < 0.05) only for a > 10-point decline in MCS. Changes in HRQL predict mortality in the older adults. A decline in HRQL should alert to a worse vital prognosis and stimulate the search for the possible determinants of such decline.

How mitochondria record the effects of UV exposure and oxidative stress using human skin as a model tissue. The accumulation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations has been proposed as an underlying cause of the ageing process and mutations have been associated with cancer in many tissues, including human skin. This involvement is linked to the key roles of mitochondrial function and mtDNA in oxidative stress production and as a mediator of apoptosis. We and others have pioneered the use of mtDNA damage as a highly sensitive biomarker of ultraviolet exposure in human skin and have also shown that the accumulation of an ageing-dependent mtDNA mutation is accelerated by exposure to sunlight, which is known to induce oxidative stress in skin. This is important as ultraviolet radiation (UVR)-induced gene mutations play a key role in the development of skin cancer and ageing in human skin. Novel applications of mtDNA as a biomarker of UVR-induced oxidative stress will also be highlighted in this review.

Preliminary investigation of bovine tuberculosis in suspected beef from a metropolitan abattoir in Ghana with Ziehl-Neelsen microscopy. Bovine tuberculosis is an important zoonotic disease transmissible through aerosols inhalation and the ingestion of contaminated milk and meat from cattle. Abattoirs in Ghana mainly depend on post-mortem examinations as means of diagnosing the presence of mycobacterium in meat (beef). A Ziehl-Neelsen microscopy was used to investigate the presence of Mycobacterium bovis as Acid-Fast Bacilli (AFBs) in beef samples from the Kumasi Metropolitan abattoir; thereby vetting post-mortem examinations at the abattoir. Lesioned lung tissues and calcified or puss-filled thoracic lymph nodes were collected at post-mortem as directed by an expert veterinarian. A total of 159 samples from 130 cattle (bulls and cows) were used in this study from April to July 2006. Ninety-five (i.e., 73.1%) of the 130 cattle sampled were positive for AFBs, whilst the remaining thirty-five (26.9%) were negative. Out of the total 159 individual samples specimen collected, 114 (71.7%) were found with AFBs. A total of 64 lung tissues and 95 lymph nodes were collected, respectively. Interestingly, 70.3% of the lung tissues were AFB-positive with 69 (72.6%) out of the 95 lymph nodes, also being positive. The ZN microscopy was effective in detecting the presence of mycobacteria, as 73.1% of the suspected samples were AFB-positive. It presupposes that, abattoir post-mortem examinations were also efficient however; the lapses of non-detection of asymptomatic carcasses could also pose a serious health risk to consumers. Also, lack of a functional on-site laboratory and a practical monitoring system was found to be unfavourable to the maintenance of meat quality. Detailed laboratory examinations (such as culture, PCR and other biochemical tests) to augment ZN microscopy is recommended for thorough detection of bovine tuberculosis.

Common Variants in TRDN and CALM1 Are Associated with Risk of Sudden Cardiac Death in Chronic Heart Failure Patients in Chinese Han Population. Recent studies suggest that variants in two calcium handling genes (RyR2 and CASQ2) associated with sudden cardiac death (SCD) and non-sudden cardiac death (NSCD) in subjects with heart failure and coronary artery disease, respectively. The purpose of this study was to identify other calcium handling genes associated with SCD in the long-term of chronic heart failure (CHF) in Chinese Han population. We investigated 20 SNPs representing 10 genes that regulated calcium handling in 1429 patients with CHF, and the genetic association with SCD and all-cause death was analysed. During a median follow-up period of 63 months, 538 patients (37.65%) died from CHF, of whom 185 (34.38%) had SCD and the others were NSCD. SNPs that pass a P value cut-off of 0.0025 were considered as significant. We found that patients carrying the CC genotype of rs3814843 on CALM1 gene had greater risks of SCD (HR 5.542, 95% CI 2.054-14.948, P = .001) and all cause death (HR 3.484, 95% CI 1.651-7.350, P = .001). After adjusting for other risk factors, significant associations remained. Moreover, patients carrying G allele of rs361508 on TRDN gene also had increased risk of SCD. Common variants in TRDN and CALM1 are associated with increased risk of SCD in patients with CHF. These findings provide further evidence for association of variants in calcium handling regulating proteins and SCD in chronic heart failure.

Topiramate in treatment of tourette syndrome. To describe the efficacy and safety of topiramate in the treatment of Tourette syndrome (TS). Charts of subjects whose conditions were diagnosed as tic disorders seen at our clinic from 2003 to 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who met diagnostic criteria for TS and were started on topiramate at our clinic with at least 1 follow-up visit after beginning topiramate were included. The efficacy of topiramate on a subjective scale, the global impression of response (0 = no response/worse, 1 = mild improvement, 2 = moderate improvement, 3 = marked improvement), and adverse effects were recorded for analysis. Of 453 subjects, 367 met diagnostic criteria for TS and 41 (11.1%; 34 males) were treated with topiramate for tics for 9.43 +/- 7.03 months (range, 1-27 months). Mean age at onset of tics was 6.93 +/- 2.78 years (range, 2-14 years) and at start of topiramate treatment was 14.83 +/- 5.63 years (range, 9-27 years). The average efficacy on tics was 2.15 +/- 1.11, and 75.6% (n = 31) of subjects had moderate to marked improvement and adverse effects included cognitive/language problems (24.4%, n = 10) and aggression or mood swings (9.8%, n = 4). This retrospective chart review suggests that topiramate can be used for tics in TS with at least moderate efficacy and typical adverse effects. Randomized controlled trials are needed.

Academic Medicine Education Institute (AMÂ·EI): Transforming the Educational Culture of Health Professionals. The Academic Medicine Education Institute (AMâEI), jointly established by Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School (Duke-NUS) and Singapore Healthcare Services (SingHealth), is a newly formed health professions education academy designed to cultivate best education practices and create a community of health professions educators. To achieve the aims of AMâEI, the needs of SingHealth educators have to be understood. Therefore, this study was carried out to assess educators' perceptions towards the current education climate and their academic needs. A 28-item questionnaire consisting of free-response, Likert-type and ranking questions was developed. The questionnaire was electronically distributed to 200 medical and nursing educators, and made available to attendees of the 2012 Singhealth Duke-NUS Scientific Congress through hardcopies. A total of 150 completed questionnaires were received (94 from electronic survey and 56 from Congress). Five themes emerged from the analysis of responses to free-response questions: 1) faculty development, 2) development of a community of educators, 3) recognition for educational efforts, 4) institutional support, and 5) better communication about SingHealth educational activities. Respondents were in highest agreement with the statements (rating of 3.7 out of 5): "The SingHealth education programmes are high quality", "New learning or teaching methods are welcomed in this institution/hospital", and "An academic appointment is important to me". The competencies that respondents felt to be the most important were facilitating discussions, presentation skills, and providing feedback (respective means = 5.1, 5, 5 of 7). This needs assessment provided us with important insights regarding SingHealth medical educators' perceptions of their education environment and established key priorities for the AMâEI's programming efforts.

The Audio Recorded Cognitive Screen (ARCS): a flexible hybrid cognitive test instrument. To describe and characterise the Audio Recorded Cognitive Screen (ARCS), a novel instrument that uses an audio device to administer selected neuropsychological tests to unsupervised individuals who write their responses in a special booklet for later scoring. The ARCS was administered to 733 individuals, comprising 550 from a normative community sample (mean age=59.14, range 18-84 years), 101 clinic patients and a separate validation sample of 82 community controls, who, together with the patients, underwent detailed neuropsychological assessments. These data were examined for the influence of demographic variables on ARCS performance, to establish normal performance and develop scoring routines, and to characterise the structure, reliability and validity of the instrument. Age, gender and education influenced ARCS performance. ARCS tests were generally reliable and correlated well with corresponding conventional neuropsychological tests. Factor analyses indicated that the ARCS measures executive functioning/attention, memory, language, verbal fluency and visuospatial functioning. The ARCS discriminated well between normal (n=82), impaired (n=33) and demented (n=25) individuals, and significantly better than did the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), including on a single, demographically adjusted, global QuickARCS score obtainable in about 3 min of the clinician's time. Receiver Operating Characteristic analyses confirmed the superiority of the ARCS over MMSE as a screen for mild dementia (AUC 0.98, 99% CI 0.95 to 1.00) or cognitive impairment (AUC 0.90, 99% CI 0.83 to 0.97). The ARCS has good validity and reliability, has a sound normative base and measures functioning in multiple cognitive domains while imposing minimal time demands upon the clinician.

Diabetes and the abdominal aortic aneurysm. The aim of this review is to delineate the association between abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) and diabetes mellitus. Mechanisms for the underlying association are then discussed. A systematic review of the English-language literature using PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases was undertaken up to September 2009. Studies reporting appropriate prevalence data were identified and a meta-analysis performed. Eleven studies were identified. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in studied patients with AAA ranged from 6% to 14%. The prevalence of diabetes in control patients without AAA ranged from 17% to 36%. Pooled analysis suggested a reduced rate of diabetes amongst people with AAA compared to those without (OR 0.65, 0.60-0.70, p<0.001). Studies so far suggest a protective role for diabetes on the development of AAA. Further research is required to demarcate the underlying mechanisms for this possible association.

Hypothermic reconditioning after cold storage improves postischemic graft function in isolated porcine kidneys. Delayed graft function still represents a major complication in clinical kidney transplantation. Here we tested the possibility to improve functional outcome of cold stored kidneys a posteriori by short-term hypothermic machine perfusion immediately prior to reperfusion. A total of 18 kidneys from female German Landrace pigs was flushed with Histidine-Tryptophan-Ketoglutarate solution and cold-stored for 18 h (control). Some grafts were subsequently subjected to 90 min of hypothermic reconditioning by hypothermic machine perfusion with (HR+O(2)) or without (HR-O(2)) oxygenation of the perfusate. Early graft function of all kidneys was assessed thereafter by warm reperfusion in vitro (n = 6, respectively). Renal function upon reperfusion was significantly enhanced by HR+O(2) with more than threefold increase in renal clearances of creatinine and urea. HR+O(2) also led to significantly higher urinary flow rates and abrogated the activation of caspase 3. By contrast, HR-O(2) was far less effective and only resulted in minor differences compared to control. It is derived from the present data that initial graft function can be significantly improved by 2 h of oxygenated machine perfusion after arrival of the preserved organ in the transplantation clinic.

Combinational treatment of gap junctional activator and tamoxifen in breast cancer cells. Tamoxifen is a drug of choice for endocrine-responsive breast tumor patients. However, tamoxifen resistance has become a major concern for the treatment of breast cancer. Combinational therapies of tamoxifen and different drugs are being frequently studied. In this study, we tested the efficacy of substituted quinolines (code name=PQ1; a gap junctional activator) in combination with tamoxifen in T47D cells. Colony growth assay was performed using soft agar to measure the colony growth, whereas cell proliferation was measured by the MTT assay in T47D cells. The level of Ki67, survivin, and BAX was measured using confocal microscopy along with western blot analysis. Apoptosis-bromodeoxyuridine triphosphate labeling was also examined in the induced treatment of T47D cells. We observed a 55% decrease in the colony growth in the presence of combination of PQ1 and tamoxifen, whereas tamoxifen alone had little effect. A combination of 10 micromol/l tamoxifen and 200 or 500 nmol/l PQ1 resulted in only 16% cell viability compared with controls at 48 h in T47D cells by the MTT assay. We found a significant increase in BAX protein at 1 h in the presence of 500 nmol/l PQ1 alone, 10 micromol/l tamoxifen alone, and the combination of PQ1 and tamoxifen. A two-fold increase was observed in active caspase 3 in the presence of combinational treatment of 10 micromol/l tamoxifen and 200 or 500 nmol/l PQ1. In addition, flow cytometric analysis showed a 50% increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the presence of the combination of tamoxifen and PQ1 compared with the control. Furthermore, the results show that combinational treatment of tamoxifen and PQ1 significantly reduces the expression of survivin in T47D cells. Gap junction inhibitor studies with carbenexolone were also performed confirming the role of gap junctions in cell proliferation and cell death. The combinational treatment of PQ1 and tamoxifen has a significant increase in BAX expression, caspase 3 activation, and DNA fragmentation. Tamoxifen alone and in combination with PQ1 showed a decrease in the expression of survivin, whereas PQ1 alone was shown to be independent of the survivin-mediated pathway. This suggests that an increase in gap junction activity can potentiate the effect of tamoxifen. The combinational treatment of tamoxifen and PQ1 also showed a significant decrease in cell viability compared with tamoxifen treatment alone. The gap junction inhibitor carbenexolone was shown to increase cell proliferation by increased cyclin D1 expression, MTT assay, and Ki67 expression. It further decreased cell death. This study shows for the first time that combinational treatment of tamoxifen and PQ1 (a gap junctional activator) can be used to potentiate apoptosis of T47D human breast cancer cells. Thus, a gap junctional activator, PQ1, could potentially alter either the length or dose of tamoxifen clinically used for breast cancer patients.

Seroprevalence to the antigens of Taenia solium cysticercosis among residents of three villages in Burkina Faso: a cross-sectional study. There is limited published information on the prevalence of human cysticercosis in West Africa. The aim of this pilot study was to estimate the prevalence of Taenia solium cysticercosis antigens in residents of three villages in Burkina Faso. Three villages were selected: The village of Batondo, selected to represent villages where pigs are allowed to roam freely; the village of PabrÃ©, selected to represent villages where pigs are usually confined; and the village of Nyonyogo, selected because of a high proportion of Muslims and limited pig farming. Clustered random sampling was used to select the participants. All participants were asked to answer an interview questionnaire on socio-demographic characteristics and to provide a blood sample. The sera were analysed using an AgELISA. The prevalence of "strong" seropositive results to the presence of antigens of the larval stages of T. solium was estimated as 10.3% (95%CI: 7.1%-14.3%), 1.4% (0.4%-3.5%) and 0.0% (0.0%-2.1%) in the 763 participants who provided a blood sample in Batondo, PabrÃ© and Nyonyogo, respectively. The prevalence of "weak" seropositive test results to the presence of antigens of the larval stages of T. solium was 1.3% (0.3%-3.2%), 0.3% (0.0%-1.9%) and 4.5% (2.0%-8.8%) in Batondo, PabrÃ© and Nyonyogo, respectively. The multivariate logistic regression, which included only Batondo and PabrÃ©, showed that village, gender, and pork consumption history were associated with AgELISA seroprevalence. This study illustrates two major points: 1) there can be large variation in the prevalence of human seropositivity to the presence of the larval stages of T. solium cysticercosis among rural areas of the same country, and 2) the serological level of the antigen, not just whether it is positive or negative, must be considered when assessing prevalence of human cysticercosis antigens.

Hesperidin from Citrus seed induces human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell apoptosis via both mitochondrial and death receptor pathways.

Prevalence and correlates of diabetes in South asian indians in the United States: findings from the metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis in South asians living in america study and the multi-ethnic study of atherosclerosis. Individuals from South Asia have high diabetes prevalence despite low body weight. We compared the prevalence of diabetes among South Asian Indians with other U.S. ethnic groups and explored correlates of diabetes. This was a cross-sectional study of 150 South Asian Indians (ages 45-79) in California, using similar methods to the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA). Type 2 diabetes was classified by fasting plasma glucose (FPG) >or=126 mg/dL, 2-h postchallenge glucose >or=200 mg/dL, or use of hypoglycemic medication. A total of 29% of Asian Indians had diabetes, 37% had prediabetes, and 34% had normal glucose tolerance. After full adjustment for covariates, Indians still had significantly higher odds of diabetes compared to whites and Latinos, but not significantly different from African Americans and Chinese Americans in MESA: Indians [odds ratio (OR), 1.0], whites [OR, 0.29; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.17-0.49], Latinos (OR, 0.59; CI, 0.34-1.00) African Americans (OR, 0.77; CI 0.45-1.32), Chinese Americans (OR, 0.78, CI, 0.45-1.32). Variables associated with prediabetes or diabetes among Indians included hypertension, fatty liver, visceral adiposity, microalbuminuria, carotid intima media thickness, and stronger traditional Indian beliefs. Indian immigrants may be more likely to have diabetes than other U.S. ethnic groups, and cultural factors may play a role, suggesting that this is a promising area of research.


3-D microfabricated electrodes for targeted deep brain stimulation.

[Microbal reduction of chlorine oxyanions using plant raw material]. A possibility of chlorates reduction at the joint growing of chlorate-reducing and cellulose-degrading bacteria on the medium with paper as a carbon source was proved. The growth rate of associative culture on the medium with paper was by 18-25% lower than that on MPB. Enrichment culture of cellulose-degrading bacteria can reduce up to 10% of added chlorates. Ethanol is the cellulose hydrolysis product which is primarily consumed under chlorate reduction; then follows the consumption of acetic and propionic acids.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus glycoproteins B and K8.1 regulate virion egress and synthesis of vascular endothelial growth factor and viral interleukin-6 in BCBL-1 cells. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) viral glycoproteins play important roles in the infectious life cycle and have been implicated in KSHV-associated endothelial cell transformation, angiogenesis, and KS-induced malignancies. KSHV-associated primary effusion lymphomas (PELs) secrete high levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6) in vitro and VEGF, vIL-6, and basic-fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) in mouse xenografts. KSHV-encoded glycoproteins B (gB) and K8.1 stimulate VEGF secretion, most likely mediated by direct or indirect binding to cell surface receptors, including the gB-specific alphaVbeta3 and alpha3beta1 integrins. In this study, the short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated inhibition of either gB or K8.1 transcription by anti-gB or -K8.1 siRNAs caused a substantial reduction in virion egress and a decrease in both vIL-6 and VEGF production. Similarly, the treatment of BCBL-1 cells with anti-gB or anti-K8.1 antibodies caused a substantial reduction in vIL-6 and VEGF production. Codon-optimized versions of either wild-type gB, mutant gB having the RGD amino acid motif changed to RAA, or K8.1 efficiently rescued virion egress and VEGF and vIL-6 production. These results suggest that the binding of gB via its RGD motif to integrin receptors was not responsible for the observed gB-associated regulation of VEGF and vIL-6 transcription. Conditioned medium collected from BCBL-1 cells transfected with anti-gB and anti-K8.1 siRNAs or treated with anti-gB and anti-K8.1 antibodies exhibited a significantly reduced ability to induce the formation of the capillary network of endothelial cells compared to the ability of medium from mock-infected BCBl-1 cells. Furthermore, medium obtained from BCBL-1 cells expressing smaller amounts of gB and K8.1 produced a substantial reduction in endothelial cell migration in a vertical migration assay compared to that of control medium containing wild-type levels of gB and K8.1. These results suggest a functional linkage between gB/K8.1 synthesis and VEGF/vIL-6 transcriptional regulation via paracrine and/or autocrine signaling pathways.

Campylobacter cholecystitis. There are 13 cases of campylobacter cholecystitis reported so far in the medical literature. Among them, only 4 patients had diarrhea. We report another case of acalculous cholecystitis in a setting of campylobacter enteritis. The case report is followed by a literature review regarding this rare condition.

Peptide mass-assisted antibody cloning strategy for accurate characterization of potential therapeutic monoclonal antibodies against neurodegenerative diseases. The development of therapeutic recombinant antibodies involves accurate characterization of immunoglobulin variable light (VL) and heavy (VH) chains. However, it has been reported that the use of subgroup or isotype-specific primers for the amplification of monoclonal antibody (mAb) variable domains introduces heterogeneities within the variable domains, or amplifies aberrant productive Ig domains. To address these issues, we have combined the rapid amplification of cDNA ends PCR (RACE-PCR) for the full-length VL and VH amplification, with peptide mass fingerprinting of the corresponding Ig chain. Using this strategy, we amplified full-length cDNA chains of SAF34 and SAF32, two potential therapeutic mAbs against neurodegenerative diseases directed to the prion protein (PrP). We report an unambiguous correlation between hybridoma cDNA sequences and protein fingerprints of the variable domains of each mAb, indicating the discrimination between mutated, pseudo-genes and functional Ig genes. As a proof of principle for this dual strategy of full-length PCR amplification of variable domains and their characterization by MALDI-TOF, we show that the corresponding scFvs recognize the native PrP and retain full capacity to bind to human PrP, as does the parental mAb. This finding addresses the need for reliable light and heavy chain characterization, a key factor for humanization of mouse antibodies and for its use in passive immunotherapy applications.

Pain perception during esophageal warming due to radiofrequency catheter ablation in the left atrium. We investigated the relationship among esophageal warming, pain perception, and the site of radiofrequency (RF) delivery in the left atrium (LA) during the course of catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. Such a procedure in awake patients is often linked to the development of visceral pain and esophageal warming. As a consequence, potentially dangerous complications have been described. Twenty patients undergoing RF ablation in the LA were studied. An esophageal probe (EP) capable of measuring endoesophageal temperature (ET) was positioned before starting the procedure. The relative position of the EP and the tip of the ablator were evaluated through fluoroscopy imaging before starting each RF delivery, during which the highest value of the temperature was collected. After RF withdrawal, the patients were asked to define the intensity of the experienced pain by using a score index ranging from 0 (no pain) to 4 (pain requiring immediate RF interruption). The mean ET value during ablation was 39.59 +/- 4.71 degrees C. The EP proximity to the ablator's tip showed a high correlation with the development of the highest ET values (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient r = 0.49, confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.41). Moreover, the highest values of pain intensity were reported when the RF was delivered to the atrial zones close to the EP projection (r = 0.50, CI 0.55-0.42) and when the highest ET levels were reached (r = 0.38, CI 0.30-0.45). Pain perception in LA ablation is significantly related to esophageal warming and is higher when the RF is delivered near the esophagus. It seems advisable to perform ET monitoring in sedated patients to avoid short- and long-term jeopardizing of the esophageal wall.

The comorbidity of diabetes mellitus and psychiatric disorders. Diabetes mellitus is a chronic disease affecting approximately 6% of the general population. Depression and schizophrenia are often comorbid with diabetes. There are two main ways to explain this phenomenon. Firstly, patients with diabetes mellitus have higher incidence of psychiatric disorders and secondly, antidepressants and antipsychotics may cause metabolic abnormalities. Antidepressants with noradrenergic activity have the highest potential to cause metabolic abnormalities. In schizophrenia, the risk is highest with clozapine and olanzapine pose the highest risk, moderate for risperidone and quetiapine, while ziprasidone and sertindole have not been associated with diabetes. American Diabetes Association and American Psychiatric Association suggested that optimal management of patients with schizophrenia should include baseline assessment on their weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, blood glucose level and lipidogram and family history on obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular illness. During the first three months, weight gain should be monitored on monthly basis, while biochemical analysis should be performed after the first three months, and then once a year. In patients with significant weight gain, increase of blood glucose level or dyslipidemia, the first intervention should be switch to another antipsychotic. If necessary, a patient should be referred to an endocrinologist and advised on changing their life style.

Grain-filling problem in 'super' rice. Modern rice (Oryza sativa L.) cultivars, especially the newly bred 'super' rice, have numerous spikelets on a panicle with a large yield capacity. However, these cultivars often fail to achieve their high yield potential due to poor grain-filling of later-flowering inferior spikelets (in contrast to the earlier-flowering superior spikelets). Conventional thinking to explain the poor grain-filling is the consequence of carbon limitation. Recent studies, however, have shown that carbohydrate supply should not be the major problem because they have adequate sucrose at their initial grain-filling stage. The low activities of key enzymes in carbon metabolism may contribute to the poor grain-filling. Proper field practices, such as moderate soil drying during mid- and late grain-filling stages, could solve some problems in poor grain-filling. Further studies are needed by molecular approaches to investigate the signal transport, the hormonal action, the gene expressions, and the biochemical processes in inferior spikelets.


Optimal treatment strategy for intracranial germ cell tumors: a single institution analysis.

Effect of intra-operative pressure support vs pressure controlled ventilation on oxygenation and lung function in moderately obese adults. Obesity impairs peri-operative lung function. To evaluate the impact of pressure support ventilation vs pressure controlled ventilation in moderately obese adults upon early postoperative lung function, we randomly assigned 68 moderately obese patients (body mass index 25-35 kg x m(-2)) undergoing minor surgery to receive intra-operative ventilation either with pressure support or pressure controlled ventilation. We performed intra-operative blood gas analysis and measured pulse oximetry saturation, spirometry values at pre-operative assessment (baseline) and at 10 min, 30 min, 2 h and 24 h after extubation. The intra-operative oxygenation index (arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen) in the pressure support ventilation group was significantly improved over time (p < 0.0001). Postoperatively, the pressure support ventilation group also had better lung function and oxygenation values than did the pressure controlled ventilation group (p < 0.005). We conclude that pressure support ventilation better maintains lung function than pressure controlled ventilation in moderately overweight patients scheduled for minor surgery.

ZnO/Au hybrid nanoarchitectures: wet-chemical synthesis and structurally enhanced photocatalytic performance. A facile method is introduced to prepare large-area gold-coated ZnO nanorods, featuring the capability to tailor both the spatial distribution and the concentration of metal nanocrystals. The Au nanoparticles-loaded ZnO nanorods exhibit complete catalysis-degradation Rhodamine B within 15 min, which substantially surpass other TiO(2)- and ZnO-based photocatalysts. Furthermore, The ZnO/Au nanocomposites can removal about 91% of environmental persistent 4-chlorophenol from water after 300 min irradiation. The better photocatalytic performance is attributed to the one-dimentional structure of high-quality ZnO nanorods and the large-area noble metal decoration. These promising results would make this photocatalyst an exceptional choice for the environmental purification of organic pollutants in aqueous solution. This approach may also give rise to a new class of multifunctional materials with possible applications in energy-conversion devices, biofunctionalized materials, and infrared-emitting/detecting devices.


Slow growing flat-type primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus treated with cap-assisted EMR.

Prevalence of wet-to-dry dressings in wound care. This retrospective descriptive study explored the prevalence of wet-to-dry dressings ordered for wound care of open wounds healing by secondary intention. Research questions included the following: How frequently are healthcare providers ordering wet-to-dry dressings for wound care? Which specialties of healthcare providers are most frequently ordering wet-to-dry dressings? Are wet-to-dry dressings being ordered appropriately? A retrospective chart review examined admission orders for 202 randomly selected Florida home care and health maintenance organization patients from 2002 to 2004. All subjects in the study had open wounds healing by secondary intention (42 partial-thickness and 160 full-thickness wounds). Frequencies are reported as the main outcome measure. Wet-to-dry dressings accounted for 42% of wound care orders, followed by enzymatic (7.43%) and dry gauze (6.93%). Most wounds treated with wet-to-dry dressings were surgical (69%), followed by neuropathic ulcers (10%) and pressure ulcers (5.9%). Surgical specialists preferred wet-to-dry dressings (73%). Mechanical debridement was not clinically indicated in more than 78% of wounds treated with wet-to-dry dressings. Therefore, wet-to-dry dressings were inappropriately ordered in these cases. These findings suggest that wet-to-dry dressings (or dry gauze) are prescribed inappropriately in situations where there is little evidence to support their use. To achieve evidence-based practice in wound care, clinical decision making should be scientifically based. Future research should focus on which wound dressings are most effective in optimizing wound healing, as well as on investigating the reasons for the continued use of wet-to-dry dressings.

Finite-Element Modelling of the Response of the Gerbil Middle Ear to Sound. We present a finite-element model of the gerbil middle ear that, using a set of baseline parameters based primarily on a priori estimates from the literature, generates responses that are comparable with responses we measured in vivo using multi-point vibrometry and with those measured by other groups. We investigated the similarity of numerous features (umbo, pars-flaccida and pars-tensa displacement magnitudes, the resonance frequency and break-up frequency, etc.) in the experimental responses with corresponding ones in the model responses, as opposed to simply computing frequency-by-frequency differences between experimental and model responses. The umbo response of the model is within the range of variability seen in the experimental data in terms of the low-frequency (i.e., well below the middle-ear resonance) magnitude and phase, the main resonance frequency and magnitude, and the roll-off slope and irregularities in the response above the resonance frequency, but is somewhat high for frequencies above the resonance frequency. At low frequencies, the ossicular axis of rotation of the model appears to correspond to the anatomical axis but the behaviour is more complex at high frequencies (i.e., above the pars-tensa break-up). The behaviour of the pars tensa in the model is similar to what is observed experimentally in terms of magnitudes, phases, the break-up frequency of the spatial vibration pattern, and the bandwidths of the high-frequency response features. A sensitivity analysis showed that the parameters that have the strongest effects on the model results are the Young's modulus, thickness and density of the pars tensa; the Young's modulus of the stapedial annular ligament; and the Young's modulus and density of the malleus. Displacements of the tympanic membrane and manubrium and the low-frequency displacement of the stapes did not show large changes when the material properties of the incus, stapes, incudomallear joint, incudostapedial joint, and posterior incudal ligament were changed by Â±10Â % from their values in the baseline parameter set.

Lipid bilayer regulation of membrane protein function: gramicidin channels as molecular force probes. Membrane protein function is regulated by the host lipid bilayer composition. This regulation may depend on specific chemical interactions between proteins and individual molecules in the bilayer, as well as on non-specific interactions between proteins and the bilayer behaving as a physical entity with collective physical properties (e.g. thickness, intrinsic monolayer curvature or elastic moduli). Studies in physico-chemical model systems have demonstrated that changes in bilayer physical properties can regulate membrane protein function by altering the energetic cost of the bilayer deformation associated with a protein conformational change. This type of regulation is well characterized, and its mechanistic elucidation is an interdisciplinary field bordering on physics, chemistry and biology. Changes in lipid composition that alter bilayer physical properties (including cholesterol, polyunsaturated fatty acids, other lipid metabolites and amphiphiles) regulate a wide range of membrane proteins in a seemingly non-specific manner. The commonality of the changes in protein function suggests an underlying physical mechanism, and recent studies show that at least some of the changes are caused by altered bilayer physical properties. This advance is because of the introduction of new tools for studying lipid bilayer regulation of protein function. The present review provides an introduction to the regulation of membrane protein function by the bilayer physical properties. We further describe the use of gramicidin channels as molecular force probes for studying this mechanism, with a unique ability to discriminate between consequences of changes in monolayer curvature and bilayer elastic moduli.

Antigen presentation in the thymus for positive selection and central tolerance induction. Understanding how thymic selection imparts self-peptide-MHC complex restriction and a high degree of self tolerance on the T cell repertoire requires a detailed description of the parameters that shape the MHC ligand repertoire of distinct thymic antigen-presenting cells and of how these cells communicate with T cells. Several recent discoveries pertaining to cortex-specific pathways of antigen processing, the heterogeneity of thymic dendritic cells and the intercellular transfer of self antigens have uncovered surprising and unique aspects of antigen presentation in the thymic microenvironment. Here, we discuss these new findings in the context of how individual thymic stromal cell types support T cell selection in a cooperative rather than a redundant manner.

Minimal cross-infection risk through Icare rebound tonometer probes: a useful tool for IOP-screenings in developing countries. Recently, a new rebound tonometer has been introduced into the market, which might be useful for glaucoma screenings in developing countries. Disposable probes, that are potentially reusable, are recommended by the manufacturer. Our study aimed to address the question of microbial transmission risks if the probes are reused. IOP measurements were obtained from 100 healthy eyes. The used probes were inoculated on broth and culture media. In addition, 10 probes were analyzed using environmental scanning electron microscopy in saturated hydrogen-steam atmosphere after usage and wipe disinfection technique with Sekusept 4% solution or Isopropanol 70%. No bacterial or fungal growth could be detected in any of the inoculated agar plates or broth tubes. No microorganisms, clumps of cells, or single intact epithelium cells were detected in any of the probes using environmental scanning electron microscopy. Cell debris was detected on seven probes; three probes were completely free of any residual cell elements. Transmission of possibly infective material through reused probes is significantly less than for reusable Goldmann probes if the same sterilization protocols are applied. Re-usage of the probes appears safe and is helpful in avoiding unnecessary costs.

Impact of Global Health Research Training on Career Trajectories: The Fogarty International Clinical Research Scholars and Fellows Program. From 2004 to 2012, the Fogarty International Clinical Research Scholars/Fellows Program (FICRS-F) provided 1-year research training opportunities for U.S. and international doctoral "Scholars" and postdoctoral "Fellows" at low- and middle-income country (LMIC) centers. We collected data prospectively and then surveyed a representative sample of 100 alumni (94% response), assessing Program impacts on their careers and collaborations. Frequently, collaborations continued beyond the formal training period with U.S.- (63%) and site-based mentors (66%). U.S. Fellows reported the highest post-training focus on research (88 on a 100-point scale), and the highest Program impact on competitiveness for career or training positions and choices of post-training topics and institutions (95 points). Interest in global health research increased markedly during the training period, especially for LMIC trainees, and was sustained post-training. LMIC alumni reported a significantly higher focus on global health and research than did U.S. alumni. Alumni reported that their mentored research training had a substantial impact on their career trajectories. 

Spatial distribution of Parkinson's disease mortality in Spain, 1989-1998, as a guide for focused aetiological research or health-care intervention. Aetiologically, genetic and environmental factors having an uneven spatial distribution may underlie Parkinson's disease (PD). Undiagnosis of PD in selected regions might have limited access to treatment with levodopa and simultaneously, if present at death, determined PD underreporting at the death record. The purpose of this study was to describe and analyse municipal mortality due to PD in Spain in aetiological and interventional perspective. PD mortality at a municipal level was modelled using the Besag-York- MolliÃ¨ autoregressive spatial model, combining demographic information with cause-of-death diagnostic data (International Classification of Diseases 9th Revision (ICD-9) code 332.0). Municipal relative risks (RRs) were independently estimated for women, men and both sexes, and plotted on maps depicting smoothed RR estimates and the distribution of the posterior probability of RR>1. A south-north gradient, with large geographical areas suggesting clustered towns with high mortality, was seen in Asturias, the Basque Country, Balearic Islands and, particularly, in the Lower Ebro valley around Tarragona. Similarly, there was a suggestion that lowest mortality was clustered in the south-east and south-west. We identified some isolated or clustered municipalities with high mortality that were situated near industrial plants reported to be associated with environmental xenobiotic emissions. However, the same pattern was also observed for some cities with low mortality. Municipal PD mortality in Spain was unevenly distributed. Patterns were roughly similar to reported provincial PD mortality and use of levodopa. While the overall pattern appears to result from spatially selective PD undiagnosis, and can not be ascribed to industrial emissions, it can not be excluded that selected "hot spots" reflect genetic factors and/or environmental exposures inducing parkinsonism. A few municipal populations, located in low-mortality-risk areas in the vicinity of polluting plants or registering high excess PD mortality, might constitute a priority for conducting direct etiological studies. Additionally, interventions aimed to reduce potential PD undiagnosis might be most appropriate in the South.

Comparative gene transfer between cationic and thiourea lipoplexes. We have previously developed lipopolythiourea lipids as neutral DNA condensing agents for systemic gene delivery. Optimization of the lipopolythiourea structure led to efficient transfecting agents. To further evaluate these lipids, we investigated the internalization process of the thiourea lipoplexes and their intracellular mechanism of transfection versus that of cationic lipoplexes. The MTT test was used for cytotoxicity assessment. Transfection efficiency was determined by luciferase read-out. Permeation to propidium iodide and enhanced green fluorescent protein was evaluated by flow cytometry. Kinetics of internalization and DNA release were monitored by confocal microscopy with labelled DNA. Endocytosis inhibitors were used to study the mechanisms of lipoplex internalization. Although thiourea/DNA complexes exhibit an almost similar level of transfection compared to that of cationic complexes, the thiourea lipoplexes were shown to be six-fold less internalized. Complexes were able to permeabilize the cytoplasmic membrane to 30 kDa molecules. Finally, DNA was shown to be released in less than 10 min in the cellular cytoplasm versus 30 min for cationic lipoplexes. Despite a weaker internalization compared to cationic lipids, the thiourea lipoplexes were able to transfect cells at a similar level as a result of its greater ability to destabilize the cytoplasmic membrane and release DNA.

Phenotypic and genomic characterization of pneumococcus-like streptococci isolated from HIV-seropositive patients. Accurate differentiation between pneumococci and other viridans streptococci is essential given their differences in clinical significance. However, classical phenotypic tests are often inconclusive, and many examples of atypical reactions have been reported. In this study, we applied various phenotypic and genotypic methods to discriminate between a collection of 12 streptococci isolated from the upper respiratory tract of HIV-seropositive individuals in 1998 and 1999. Conventional phenotypic characterization initially classified these streptococci as Streptococcus pneumoniae, as they were all sensitive to optochin and were all bile soluble. However, they did not agglutinate with anti-pneumococcal capsular antibodies and were also far more resistant to antimicrobial agents than typeable pneumococci isolated in the same period. Genotypic characterization of these isolates and control isolates by both multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) and comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) showed that only a single isolate was genetically considered to be a true S. pneumoniae isolate, and that the remaining 11 non-typable isolates were indeed distinct from true pneumococci. Of these, 10 most closely resembled a subgroup of Streptococcus mitis isolates genetically, while one strain was identified as a Streptococcus pseudopneumoniae isolate. CGH also showed that a considerable part of the proposed pneumococcal core genome, including many of the known pneumococcal virulence factors, was conserved in the non-typable isolates. Sequencing of part of the 16S rRNA gene and investigation for the presence of ply by PCR corroborated these results. In conclusion, our findings confirm the close relationship between streptococci of the Mitis group, and show that both MLSA and CGH enable pneumococci to be distinguished from other Mitis group streptococci.

Suppression of miR-221 inhibits glioma cells proliferation and invasion via targeting SEMA3B. Gliomas are the most common primary tumors in the central nervous system. Due to complicated signaling pathways involved in glioma progression, effective targets for treatment and biomarkers for prognosis prediction are still scant. In this study we revealed that a new microRNA (miR), the miR-221, was highly expressed in the glioma cells, and suppression of miR-221 resulted in decreased cellular proliferation, migration, and invasion in glioma cells. Mechanistic experiments validated that miR-221 participates in regulating glioma cells proliferation and invasion via suppression of a direct target gene, the Semaphorin 3B (SEMA3B). The rescue experiment with miR-221 and SEMA3B both knockdown results in significant reversion of miR-221 induced phenotypes. Taken together, our findings highlight an unappreciated role for miR-221 and SEMA3B in glioma.

Blood delta-ALAD, lead and cadmium concentrations in spur-thighed tortoises (Testudo graeca) from Southeastern Spain and Northern Africa. Mediterranean spur-thighed tortoise (Testudo graeca) is actually included in the IUCN as vulnerable species. Its main European population is located in southeastern Spain. Although a great deal of information has been acquired on the internal medicine and survey and even parasitological fauna on these animals, there are no references about contaminants levels in this species. The objectives of this study were to compare the levels of two metals (cadmium and lead) in the blood of spur-thighed tortoises from two different populations, one from Southeastern of Spain (n = 22) and the other from North of Africa (n = 39), kept in captivity at the Santa Faz Recuperation Centre (Alicante, Spain) and to investigate the relationship between their blood levels of lead and their blood delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (delta-ALAD) activity. Blood lead and cadmium concentrations were higher in tortoises from African than in those from Spain. Moreover, a negative and significant correlation (P < 0.05) was found between delta-ALAD activity and blood lead levels, indicating the suitability of this enzyme as biomarker for lead in this species.

Removal of Pb from sewage sludge by electrokinetics: effect of pH and washing solution type. In this study, the effect of pH and washing solution on the removal of lead from sewage sludge by electrokinetics was investigated. The six experimental runs were carried out at two different pH values--3 and 4--using acetic acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid. In addition, the sequential chemical extraction scheme according to the BCR's (Community Bureau of Reference) guidelines was applied to the sludge samples to evaluate the effect of acidic solutions on Pb fractionation during electrokinetic processes. Using nitric acid as the washing solution resulted in the highest removal efficiency of Pb (39%) amongst all the experiments. Acetic acid also provided similar removal percentages (37% and 38%) at different pre-acidification conditions. On the other hand, the removal efficiencies were 36% and 27% with pre-acidification using phosphoric acid at pH 3 and 4, respectively, resulting in the lowest efficiencies. The results obtained by BCR analysis showed that the metal present near the anode partitioned in to more mobile forms while the metal near the cathode partitioned in to less mobile forms, such as precipitated or adsorbed forms, as the electrokinetic process proceeded. The inter-fractional transformations of Pb formed only when using acetic acid. The similar percentages obtained by using different washing solutions indicated that the type of acid used as washing solution was less effective than the values of pH for removal of Pb from sewage sludge during the electrokinetic process.

Solutions for low and high accuracy mass spectrometric data matching: a data-driven annotation strategy in nontargeted metabolomics. Ultra high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) has become a widespread analytical technique in metabolomics investigations, however the benefit of high-performance chromatographic separation is often blunted due to insufficient mass spectrometric accuracy. A strategy that allows for the matching of UHPLC-MS data to highly accurate direct infusion electrospray ionization (DI-ESI) Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance/mass spectrometry (FTICR/MS) data is developed in this manuscript. Mass difference network (MDiN) based annotation of FTICR/MS data and matching to unique UHPLC-MS peaks enables the consecutive annotation of the chromatographic data set. A direct comparison of experimental m/z values provided no basis for the matching of both platforms. The matching of annotation-based exact neutral masses finally enabled the integration of platform specific multivariate statistical evaluations, minimizing the danger to compare artifacts generated on either platform. The approach was developed on a non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) data set. 

The expression level of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor type 1 is related to MIB-1 labeling index and predicts survival of glioblastoma patients. Although there are many reports on the clinical use of the MIB-1 labeling index (LI), which is a measure of proliferative activity in astrocytomas; its significance varies between studies. There are no known molecules that are directly linked to the MIB-1 LI in astrocytomas. We evaluated the clinical value of the MIB-1 LI in our human glioblastoma cases and determined the molecules that possibly influenced the MIB-1 LI. An immunohistochemical study of the MIB-1 protein was performed and MIB-1 LIs of 38 glioblastomas were determined. In the same cases, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor-alpha (PDGFRA), and sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor type 1 (S1P(1)), which are known regulators of glioma cell proliferation, were detected and quantified by quantitative real-time-PCR or western blotting. Kaplan-Meier survival curves for 38 patients with glioblastomas showed that a high MIB-1 LI correlated with poor survival (P < 0.05). Among the molecules tested, only the low expression of S1P(1) was significantly correlated with the high MIB-1 LI in glioblastomas (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that the S1P(1) expression level was a significant prognostic factor. Our results indicate that the MIB-1 LI is an important prognostic factor in human glioblastomas. Furthermore, downregulation of S1P(1) expression increases proliferative activity, and thus enhances the malignancy of glioblastomas, resulting in a poor survival.

Roles of kisspeptins in the control of hypothalamic-gonadotropic function: focus on sexual differentiation and puberty onset. Kisspeptins, a family of peptides encoded by the Kiss1 gene that act via the G protein-coupled receptor 54 (GPR54 or Kiss1R), were initially catalogued as metastasis suppressors, but have recently emerged as pivotal gatekeepers of puberty onset and reproductive function. Indeed, since the seminal observations (in late 2003) that inactivating mutations of GPR54 are coupled to absence of puberty and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism in human and mice, a large number of experimental studies, conducted in different species, including humans, have substantiated the roles of kisspeptins and GPR54 as essential elements in the physiologic regulation of key aspects of reproductive maturation and function. These appear to include, among others, the process of brain sexual differentiation during critical (early) periods of maturation and the timing of puberty onset. Recent exciting developments in these particular areas will be comprehensively reviewed herein. These functions, together with the proven roles of kisspeptins in the control of GnRH neurons and the transmission ofthe regulatory actions of key signals, such as sex steroids, metabolic hormones and environmental cues, point out that the Kiss1 system is an indispensable player of the reproductive brain, whose discovery is now considered as (one of) the most important findings in reproductive physiology in the last decades.

Flowsheets that include MDHAQ physical function, pain, global, and RAPID3 scores, laboratory tests, and medications to monitor patients with all rheumatic diseases: an electronic database for an electronic medical record. Electronic medical records (EMR) are used increasingly in contemporary medical care. Function, pain, global status, and RAPID3 scores remain important considerations in all rheumatic diseases. Inclusion of these scores in a flowsheet that also includes laboratory tests and medications could transform the EMR into a true medical database. Flowsheets are presented for patients with rheumatologic diagnoses other than rheumatoid arthritis to illustrate the value of the multidimensional health assessment questionnaire and RAPID3 scores in an electronic database for an EMR.

The attitudes of student and registered nurses to sleep promotion in hospitals. This study explored the attitudes of student and registered nurses regarding sleep promotion in hospitals. Qualitative data were obtained using semistructured interviews with volunteer samples and subsequently transcribed and analysed. The findings showed that the study participants held generally positive attitudes to sleep as a curative and beneficial medium. However, for many there were clear blocks to their practice, including the attitudes of others, the ward culture and routine orientation of care, resulting in sleep promotion having a low priority. The implications of the findings include the need to foster staff awareness and practice of this element of care, particularly through managers who have to take responsibility for encouraging a positive ethos towards sleep promotion.

Experimentally calibrated computational chemistry of tryptophan hydroxylase: trans influence, hydrogen-bonding, and 18-electron rule govern O2-activation. Insight into the nature of oxygen activation in tryptophan hydroxylase has been obtained from density functional computations. Conformations of O(2)-bound intermediates have been studied with oxygen trans to glutamate and histidine, respectively. An O(2)-adduct with O(2)trans to histidine (O(his)) and a peroxo intermediate with peroxide trans to glutamate (P(glu)) were found to be consistent (0.57-0.59mm/s) with experimental MÃ¶ssbauer isomer shifts (0.55mm/s) and had low computed free energies. The weaker trans influence of histidine is shown to give rise to a bent O(2) coordination mode with O(2) pointing towards the cofactor and a more activated O-O bond (1.33A) than in O(glu) (1.30A). It is shown that the cofactor can hydrogen bond to O(2) and activate the O-O bond further (from 1.33 to 1.38A). The O(his) intermediate leads to a ferryl intermediate (F(his)) with an isomer shift of 0.34mm/s, also consistent with the experimental value (0.25mm/s) which we propose as the structure of the hydroxylating intermediate, with the tryptophan substrate well located for further reaction 3.5A from the ferryl group. Based on the optimized transition states, the activation barriers for the two paths (glu and his) are similar, so a two-state scenario involving O(his) and P(glu) is possible. A structure of the activated deoxy state which is high-spin implies that the valence electron count has been lowered from 18 to 16 (glutamate becomes bidentate), giving a "green light" that invites O(2)-binding. Our mechanism of oxygen activation in tryptophan hydroxylase does not require inversion of spin, which may be an important observation.

RECURRENT SUBRETINAL HEMORRHAGE ASSOCIATED WITH RIVAROXABAN ANTICOAGULATION. To report a case of spontaneous recurrent significant subretinal hemorrhage in a patient on rivaroxaban (Xarelto). A case report of a 63-year-old man on rivaroxaban with peripapillary choroidal neovascular membrane and macula involving subretinal hemorrhage. Improvement in visual acuity from 20/200 to 20/30 and restoration of foveal contour after pneumatic displacement of hemorrhage with C3F8 gas and subsequent treatment with ranibizumab. The authors report a case of recurrent subretinal hemorrhage associated with rivaroxaban use. Pneumatic displacement and subsequent treatment of choroidal neovascular membrane with intravitreal ranibizumab improved visual acuity.

Sonographic assessment of tumor response: from in vivo models to clinical applications. The advent of antiangiogenic drugs in cancer therapy necessitates an imaging modality that can longitudinally assess posttreatment changes in tumor vasculature. In this regard, microbubble contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) offers several advantages over conventional imaging modalities. The small size of microbubbles (approximately 2-3 mum) permits their retention in the intravascular compartment and travel through the tortuous tumor vasculature. Mathematical models applied to signal intensity versus time depicting the kinetics of microbubble flow through the tumor are used to characterize tumor vascular density, blood flow velocity, and perfusion. In vivo studies using CEUS have demonstrated its comparability to dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography in distinguishing between diseased or malignant tissue and normal tissue. Moreover, CEUS has great potential for other novel clinical applications such as improved cancer diagnosis, enhanced medication delivery, and early antiangiogenic cancer treatment response evaluation. This review discusses the principles and potential clinical applications of CEUS in determining tumor response and its promising role in enhancing medication delivery in certain tumors.

Effect of Astragalus membranaceus and Angelica sinensis combined with Enalapril in rats with obstructive uropathy. ACE inhibitors (ACEi) reduce renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis but are not completely effective. Combined extract of Astragalus membranaceus and Angelica sinensis (A&A) is a traditional antifibrotic agent in China. The present investigation aimed to determine whether an ACEi (Enalapril) and A&A together have a better antifibrotic effect in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) than monotherapy with either agent. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (N = 4 per group) had either sham operation or UUO alone, with A&A (combined aqueous and ethanol extract equivalent to 2.1 g dried herbs), with Enalapril (in drinking water at 200 mg/mL) or with both treatments. Kidney and liver were collected for protein extraction or fixed for histologic stains, immunohistochemistry (IHC), microscopy. Enalapril or A&A individually were antifibrotic. Transforming growth factor-beta1, fibroblast activation, collagen deposition, macrophage accumulation and tubular cell apoptosis were all decreased. The combination of the two drugs was significantly more effective than Enalapril alone in reducing tumor necrosis factor-alpha, collagen accumulation, activation of fibroblasts, and tubular cell apoptosis. In conclusion, Enalapril with A&A significantly decreased tubulointerstitial fibrosis to a greater extent than treatment with Enalapril alone. Further studies focusing on the isolation of the active constituents of A&A and the clinical application of the combination of ACEi plus A&A are warranted to determine the value of this treatment in humans.

Formulation and optimization of solid lipid nanoparticles of buspirone HCl for enhancement of its oral bioavailability. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNs) of buspirone HCl as a water-soluble drug were prepared by emulsification-evaporation, followed by the sonification method. A preliminary screening of the most effective parameters on the production of nanoparticles by a Taguchi L(8) orthogonal array showed that the lipid type, surfactant percentage, speed of homogenizer, and acetone:dichloromethane (DCM) ratio had a significant effect on particle size. In the next step, the lipid was fixed on cetyl alcohol, surfactant on Tween 20, lecithin:lipid weight ratio on 20:70, sonication time on 30 seconds, and the other effective, independent factors aforementioned were studied each at three levels by a three-factor, three-level Box-Behnken design. The percentage of drug entrapment, mean particle-size diameter, and zeta potential were studied as the responses. Contour plots were constructed to further elucidate the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. A pharmacokinetic study was conducted in male Wistar rats after oral administration of 15âmg.kg(-1) buspirone in the form of free drug or SLNs. The optimized SLNs had aq particle size of 345.7ânm, loading efficiency of 32.8%, and zeta potential of -6.8âmV. Buspirone released about 90% during 4.5âhours in vitro. It was found that the relative bioavailability of the drug in SLNs was significantly increased, compared to that of the drug solution.

Findings of clinical, neuropathological and biochemical studies have supported the idea that frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitin inclusions (FTLD-U) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are part of a neurological disease spectrum. This concept is now further strengthened by the recent discovery of a 43-kDa transactivating responsive sequence DNA-binding protein (TDP-43) as a key component of the underlying neuropathology of FTLD-U, ALS with dementia (ALS-D) and ALS. Here we describe the clinicopathological features of selected autopsy cases belonging to this disease spectrum, and discuss the neuropathological similarities and differences between FTLD-U and ALS-D, with special reference to the morphology, distribution and density of ubiquitin/TDP-43-positive abnormal structures, along with a review of the literature.

[Sharing of needles and paraphernalia injection in new and long-term injection drug users in Sichuan, China]. To examine the prevalence and correlates for needle-sharing among new and long-term injection drug users (IDUs) in Sichuan province, China. Three consecutive cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 6 prefectures of Sichuan province, from 2003 to 2005. Questionnaire-based interviews provided information including socio-demographics, drug-use, sexual behaviors, and HIV-related services. Multivariable logistic regression methodology was used for data analysis. Of 3852 eligible participants, the rates of needle-sharing in the last 6 months for IDUs with a less than one year, one to three year, and more than three year injection history were 19.9%, 29.1%, and 36.3%, respectively. Needle-sharing for IDUs with a less than one-year injection history was independently associated with factors as: being female, having minority background, higher frequency of injection, sharing injecting equipments, ever having had a non-regular sex partner, or a regular sex partner who injected drugs, never had a test on HIV, being recruited in 2005, and from Zigong prefectures of Sichuan. Needle-sharing for IDUs with a 1-3 year injection history were independently associated with receiving less education, having higher frequency of injecting behavior, sharing injecting equipments, ever having had a non-regular sex partner/a regular sex partner who injected drugs, ever having had unprotected sex with a non-regular sex partner, ever having had unprotected sex with a commercial sex partner or client, never attended skill training for HIV/STD prevention, being recruited in 2005 and 2004, and being recruited from Deyang, Zigong, and Liangshan prefectures. Needle-sharing for IDUs with a more than three-year injection history was independently associated with factors as: less education, higher frequency of injecting, sharing injecting equipment, ever had a non-regular sex partner, ever had unprotected sex with a non-regular sex partner, ever had unprotected sex with a commercial sex partner or client, having had regular sex partners who inject drugs, never attended needle exchange programs, being recruited in 2005 and 2004, and being recruited from Deyang, Zigong, and Liangshan prefectures. The rates for both needle/paraphernalia sharing and unprotected sex behaviors were high in the IDUs in Sichuan province. These rates were higher among longer-term IDUs than in new IDUs. Our data underlined that better targeted, in-depth and sustained comprehensive intervention packages which including needle exchange, condom promotion along with distribution, and education, were urgently needed to reduce both IDU-related and sex-related risk behaviors among both new and longer term IDUs.

PCBs in schools--where communities and science come together. A novel aspect of the 8th International PCB Workshop at Woods Hole, MA, was the interaction between scientists and activists. While earlier workshops in this series had mentioned policy making, this Workshop focused on the problem of PCBs in schools. Focus on a problem brought an activist to give a plenary talk and facilitated a 1-day registration for other non-scientists to attend. The workshop was cohosted by the Superfund Research Programs at University of Iowa and Boston University and included active participation of each Program's Research Translation and Community Engagement Cores. A mandate of each National Institute of Environmental Health Science (NIEHS)-funded Superfund Research Program is bidirectional communication between scientists and community groups. The authors describe the events leading up to community involvement in the Workshop and the substance of the community engagement aspects of the workshop, in particular the participation by a parent-teacher group, Malibu Unites. The authors also discuss the value of such communication in terms of making important research accessible to those who are most affected by the results and poised to use it and the value of making scientists aware of the important role they play in society in addressing difficult questions that originate in community settings.

[Efficacy and safety of infliximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis]. To investigate the efficacy and safety of Infliximab (IFX) plus methotrexate (MTX) combination therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Prospectively observe refractory RA patients who were treated with combination therapy of MTX and IFX. IFX was infused at the dosage of 3 mg/kg, in week 0, 2, 6, and then every 8 weeks. During treatment, clinical variables, disease activity and adverse effects were evaluated. After treatment, 69.8%, 52.4%, 29.5% and 7.2% RA patients achieved ACR20, ACR50, ACR70 and ACR90 respectively. There were significant statistical differences in the changes of swollen joint counts, tender joint counts, VAS scale, patient' s global assessment, and physician's global assessment before and after therapy. Infliximab plus MTX achieved significant efficacy and safety in refractory RA patients.

Deletional and regulatory mechanisms coalesce to drive transplantation tolerance through mixed chimerism. Establishing donor-specific immunological tolerance could improve long-term outcome by obviating the need for immunosuppressive drug therapy, which is currently required to control alloreactivity after organ transplantation. Mixed chimerism is defined as the engraftment of donor hematopoietic stem cells in the recipient, leading to viable coexistence of both donor and recipient leukocytes. In numerous experimental models, cotransplantation of donor bone marrow (BM) into preconditioned (e.g., through irradiation or cytotoxic drugs) recipients leads to transplantation tolerance through (mixed) chimerism. Mixed chimerism offers immunological advantages for clinical translation; pilot trials have established proof of concept by deliberately inducing tolerance in humans. Widespread clinical application is prevented, however, by the harsh preconditioning currently necessary for permitting BM engraftment. Recently, the immunological mechanisms inducing and maintaining tolerance in experimental mixed chimerism have been defined, revealing a more prominent role for regulation than historically assumed. The evidence from murine models suggests that both deletional and regulatory mechanisms are critical in promoting complete tolerance, encompassing also the minor histocompatibility antigens. Here, we review the current understanding of tolerance through mixed chimerism and provide an outlook on how to realize widespread clinical translation based on mechanistic insights gained from chimerism protocols, including cell therapy with polyclonal regulatory T cells.

Opioid-induced decreases in rat brain adenosine levels are reversed by inhibiting adenosine deaminase. Opioids disrupt sleep and adenosine promotes sleep, but no studies have characterized the effects of opioids on adenosine levels in brain regions known to regulate states of arousal. Delivering opioids to the pontine reticular formation (PRF) and substantia innominata (SI) region of the basal forebrain disrupts sleep. In contrast, administering adenosine agonists to the PRF or SI increases sleep. These findings encouraged the current study testing the hypothesis that microdialysis delivery of opioids to the PRF or SI decreases adenosine levels in the PRF or SI, respectively. A microdialysis probe was placed in the PRF of isoflurane anesthetized rats and perfused with Ringer's solution (control) followed by Ringer's solution containing morphine (0, 10, 30, 100, or 300 microm), fentanyl (100 microm), morphine (100 microm) and the adenosine deaminase inhibitor EHNA (100 microm), or naloxone (10 microm) and morphine (100 microm). Additional experiments measured adenosine levels in the SI before and during microdialysis delivery of morphine, fentanyl, and morphine plus EHNA. Morphine caused a significant (P < 0.05) concentration-dependent decrease in PRF adenosine levels. The significant decrease (-20%) in adenosine caused by 100 microm morphine was blocked by coadministration of naloxone. Fentanyl also significantly decreased (-13.3%) PRF adenosine. SI adenosine levels were decreased by morphine (-26.8%) and fentanyl (-27.4%). In both PRF and SI, coadministration of morphine and EHNA prevented the significant decrease in adenosine levels caused by morphine alone. These data support the interpretation that decreased adenosine levels in sleep-regulating brain regions may be one of the mechanisms by which opioids disrupt sleep.

Noncoding RNA of glutamine synthetase I modulates antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Overexpression of antisense chromosomal cis-encoded noncoding RNAss (ncRNAs) in glutamine synthetase I resulted in a decrease in growth, protein synthesis, and antibiotic production in Streptomyces coelicolor. In addition, we predicted 3,597 cis-encoded ncRNAs and validated 13 of them experimentally, including several ncRNAs that are differentially expressed in bacterial hormone-defective mutants.

Singapore's response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak: what do Singapore physicians think? To gauge Singapore physicians' perceptions of the national response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak using a questionnaire survey. Random sampling was applied to draw the survey population. Descriptive analysis and logistic regressions were used. The majority of physicians agreed that home quarantine of contacts of patients with probable SARS was warranted (95%), government's public education effort was effective (83%), and the overall Singapore's response was commendable (82%). Only 38%, however, agreed that health care workers were supplied with timely and adequate personal protective equipment. Most Singapore physicians have positive comments about the national response to the SARS crisis. However, systematic weaknesses are identified and recommendations are presented.

Gastroprotective flavonoid constituents from Oroxylum indicum Vent. Chemical investigation of the stem bark of Oroxylum indicum resulted in the isolation and characterization of two new flavonoid glycosides (1, 2), along with seven known compounds (3-9). Their structures were established on the basis of extensive spectroscopic (IR, MS, 2D NMR) data analysis and by the comparison with spectroscopic data reported in the literature. In addition, all the compounds were tested for their ulcer protective effects against various gastric ulceritis inducing models in rats.

Association of body fat percentage and heart rate variability measures of sympathovagal balance. We tested the hypothesis that body fat percentage determines cardiac sympathovagal balance in healthy subjects. Heart rate variability (HRV) measurements were made of the standard deviation of the normal-normal RR intervals (SDNN) and the low frequency/high frequency (LF/HF) ratio, from time domain and fast Fourier transform spectral analysis of electrocardiogram RR intervals during trials of uncontrolled and controlled (paced) breathing at 0.2Hz. Body fat percentage was measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometric (DEXA) scanning. Significance of differences between uncontrolled and controlled (paced) breathing was determined by analysis of variance and correlations between body fat percentage and HRV measurements by Pearson's coefficient at P<0.05. Percent body fat was negatively correlated with LF/HF during the uncontrolled breathing (r=-0.56, two-tailed P<0.05, one-tailed P<0.01) but not during the paced breathing trial (r=-0.34, (P>0.1). We conclude that sympathetic activity produced by paced breathing at 0.2Hz can obscure the relationship between body fat percentage and sympathovagal balance and that high body fat percentage may be associated with low sympathetic modulation of the heart rate in healthy adolescent/young adult males.

Evaluation of the persistence of vaccine-induced protection with human vaccines. The persistence of protection induced by vaccines is a key aspect of the implementation of human vaccination policies, particularly for ageing populations. At the time of initial licensure, the duration of protection induced by a vaccine is generally only documented by longitudinal follow up of cohorts of subjects enrolled in the pre-licensure trials over a period of 1-5 years. The follow up of these cohorts provides two types of data: antibody kinetics (or another clinically relevant immunological parameter) over time and the disease incidence. Generally, the latter trials, if implemented during the pre-licensure period, are designed to follow-up cohorts in order to demonstrate vaccine efficacy above the minimal level required for the license. For vaccines already licensed, additional tools exist. The use of immunological surrogate markers of protection is a practical way to monitor the duration of protection. Measuring the persistence of circulating antibodies is widely used in human vaccines. For several vaccines, observed data have allowed the creation of mathematical models to predict the antibody persistence over periods of time longer than those effectively documented. Clinical trials assessing the capacity of the immune system to mount a quick anamnestic response upon re-stimulation a long time after initial priming (measurement of immune memory) is also a tool employed to document the duration of protection. The waning of protection can also be demonstrated by an increase of disease incidence in the subsequent 'time-to-last-vaccine administration' age segments. Seroprevalence studies in a given age group of people that were vaccinated under real-life conditions are another way to document the persistence of protection. Finally, case-control studies in outbreak situations or in situations of persisting endemicity can also be used to document the persistence of the vaccine efficacy. All of these tools are used in the development of new vaccines, and also during their use in the field, in order to develop the best (re)vaccination policies.

Changes in Plasma Lipids during Exposure to Total Sleep Deprivation. The effects of sleep loss on plasma lipids, which play an important role in energy homeostasis and signaling, have not been systematically examined. Our aim was to identify lipid species in plasma that increase or decrease reliably during exposure to total sleep deprivation. Twenty individuals underwent sleep deprivation in a laboratory setting. Blood was drawn every 4 h and mass spectrometry techniques were used to analyze concentrations of 263 lipid species in plasma, including glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, and sterols. Chronobiology and Sleep Laboratory, Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School. Healthy ethnic-Chinese males aged 21-28 y (n = 20). Subjects were kept awake for 40 consecutive hours. Each metabolite time series was modeled as a sum of sinusoidal (circadian) and linear components, and we assessed whether the slope of the linear component differed from zero. More than a third of all individually analyzed lipid profiles exhibited a circadian rhythm and/or a linear change in concentration during sleep deprivation. Twenty-five lipid species showed a linear and predominantly unidirectional trend in concentration levels that was consistent across participants. Choline plasmalogen levels decreased, whereas several phosphatidylcholine (PC) species and triacylglycerides (TAG) carrying polyunsaturated fatty acids increased. The decrease in choline plasmalogen levels during sleep deprivation is consistent with prior work demonstrating that these lipids are susceptible to degradation by oxidative stress. The increase in phosphatidylcholines and triacylglycerides suggests that sleep loss might modulate lipid metabolism, which has potential implications for metabolic health in individuals who do not achieve adequate sleep.

Localization of epileptic foci in children with intractable epilepsy secondary to multiple cortical tubers by using synthetic aperture magnetometry kurtosis. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has been typically used to localize epileptic activity by modeling interictal activity as equivalent current dipoles (ECDs). Synthetic aperture magnetometry (SAM) is a recently developed adaptive spatial filtering algorithm for MEG that provides some advantages over the ECD approach. The SAM-kurtosis algorithm (also known as SAM[g2]) additionally provides automated temporal detection of spike sources by using excess kurtosis value (steepness of epileptic spike on virtual sensors). To evaluate the efficacy of the SAM(g2) method, the authors applied it to readings obtained in children with intractable epilepsy secondary to tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), and compared them to localizations obtained with ECDs. The authors studied 13 children with TSC (7 girls) whose ages ranged from 13 months to 16.3 years (mean 7.3 years). Video electroencephalography, MR imaging, and MEG studies were analyzed. A single ECD model was applied to localize ECD clusters. The SAM(g2) value was calculated at each SAM(g2) virtual voxel in the patient's MR imaging-defined brain volume. The authors defined the epileptic voxels of SAM(g2) (evSAM[g2]) as those with local peak kurtosis values higher than half of the maximum. A clustering of ECDs had to contain > or = 6 ECDs within 1 cm of each other, and a grouping of evSAM(g2)s had to contain > or = 3 evSAM(g2)s within 1 cm of each other. The authors then compared both ECD clusters and evSAM(g2) groups with the resection area and correlated these data with seizure outcome. Seizures started when patients were between 6 weeks and 8 years of age (median 6 months), and became intractable secondary to multiple tubers in all cases. Ictal onset on scalp video electroencephalography was lateralized in 8 patients (62%). The MEG studies showed multiple ECD clusters in 7 patients (54%). The SAM(g2) method showed multiple groups of epileptic voxels in 8 patients (62%). Colocalization of grouped evSAM(g2) with ECD clusters ranged from 20 to 100%, with a mean of 82%. Eight patients underwent resection of single (1 patient) and multiple (7 patients) lobes, with 6 patients achieving freedom from seizures. Of 8 patients who underwent surgery, in 7 the resection area covered ECD clusters and grouped evSAM(g2)s. In the remaining patient the resection area partially included the ECD cluster and grouped evSAM(g2)s. Six of the 7 patients became seizure free. The combination of SAM(g2) and ECD analyses succeeded in localizing the complex epileptic zones in children with TSC who had intractable epilepsy secondary to multiple cortical tubers. For the subset of children with TSC who present with early-onset and nonlateralized seizures, MEG studies in which SAM(g2) and ECD are used might identify suitable candidates for resection to control seizures.

Analysis of surface EMG-force relation of the first dorsal interosseous muscle. The electromyogram (EMG)-force relation was investigated using 2-dimensional surface electrode arrays. The surface EMG and isometric contraction forces were recorded from the first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscles in 4 human subjects when they generated different levels of isometric contraction in three radial directions: abduction, flexion, and a linear combination of abduction and flexion. The surface EMG-force relation, fitted by a straight line, was constructed for each tested task direction. We found that the FDI muscle did not activate uniformly across the different directions of isometric contraction, resulting in variations in slope of the surface EMG-force relation. Furthermore, this variation was also sensitive to different channels of the surface electrode array on the muscle.

Mammographic density, plasma vitamin D levels and risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Mammographic density is a strong risk factor for breast cancer, but the underlying biology for this association is unknown. Studies suggest that vitamin D may reduce breast cancer risk and dietary vitamin D intake has been associated with reduced breast density. We conducted a case-control study nested within the Nurses' Health Study cohort consisting of 463 and 497 postmenopausal cases and controls, respectively. We examined the association between mammographic density and plasma levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)(2)D]. We assessed whether plasma vitamin D metabolites modify the association between breast density and breast cancer. Percent mammographic density was measured from digitized film mammograms. Generalized linear models were used to determine mean percent breast density per quartile of vitamin D metabolite. Logistic regression models were used to calculate relative risks and confidence intervals. All models were adjusted for matching variables and potential confounders. We found no cross-sectional association between circulating levels of 25(OH)D or 1,25(OH)(2)D with mammographic density. Women in the highest tertile of mammographic density and lowest tertile of plasma 25(OH)D had 4 times greater risk of breast cancer than women with the lowest mammographic density and highest plasma 25(OH)D levels (RR = 3.8; 95% CI: 2.0-7.3). The overall interaction between mammographic density and plasma 25(OH)D was nonsignificant (p-het = 0.20). These results indicate that the association between mammographic density and breast cancer is independent of plasma vitamin D metabolites in postmenopausal women. Further research examining vitamin D, mammographic density and breast cancer risk is warranted.

Characteristics of patients with chronic pain accessing treatment with medical cannabis in Washington State. This study was conducted to better understand the characteristics of chronic pain patients seeking treatment with medicinal cannabis (MC). Retrospective chart reviews of 139 patients (87 males, median age 47 years; 52 females, median age 48 years); all were legally qualified for MC use in Washington State. Regional pain clinic staffed by university faculty. age 18 years and older; having legally accessed MC treatment, with valid documentation in their medical records. All data were de-identified. Records were scored for multiple indicators, including time since initial MC authorization, qualifying condition(s), McGill Pain score, functional status, use of other analgesic modalities, including opioids, and patterns of use over time. Of 139 patients, 15 (11 percent) had prior authorizations for MC before seeking care in this clinic. The sample contained 236.4 patient-years of authorized MC use. Time of authorized use ranged from 11 days to 8.31 years (median of 1.12 years). Most patients were male (63 percent) yet female patients averaged 0.18 years longer authorized use. There were no other gender-specific trends or factors. Most patients (n = 123, 88 percent) had more than one pain syndrome present. Myofascial pain syndrome was the most common diagnosis (n = 114, 82 percent), followed by neuropathic pain (n = 89, 64 percent), discogenic back pain (n = 72, 51.7 percent), and osteoarthritis (n = 37, 26.6 percent). Other diagnoses included diabetic neuropathy, central pain syndrome, phantom pain, spinal cord injury, fibromyalgia, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV neuropathy, visceral pain, and malignant pain. In 51 (37 percent) patients, there were documented instances of major hurdles related to accessing MC, including prior physicians unwilling to authorize use, legal problems related to MC use, and difficulties in finding an affordable and consistent supply of MC. Data indicate that males and females access MC at approximately the same rate, with similar median authorization times. Although the majority of patient records documented significant symptom alleviation with MC, major treatment access and delivery barriers remain.

Clinical and radiographic results of balloon kyphoplasty for treatment of vertebral body metastases and multiple myelomas. Kyphoplasty is a minimally invasive procedure that is used to augment vertebral body strength. This technique has been commonly used to treat osteoporotic, vertebral body compression fractures. The technique was also used to augment painful metastatic vertebral fractures. The objective of this study was to review the clinical and radiological results after kyphoplasty in patients with vertebral body compression fractures due to spinal metastasis and multiple myeloma and to determine factors that may affect outcome. Thirty-one patients had 41 vertebral body fractures secondary to spinal metastasis or multiple myeloma. A kyphoplasty procedure was performed on 39 levels. The pain and neurological status were evaluated using the visual analogue scale (VAS) score and the American Spinal Injury Association classification scale scores, respectively. Radiological evaluations were used to measure vertebral body height loss (VBHL) and the segmental kyphosis angle before and after surgery. The major symptoms that patients presented with included pain (25 patients); and neurological deficit (four patients). Two patients presented with no symptoms because the metastases were found during cancer screening. The mean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) VAS score was 7.2+/-2.2 before surgery and 1.6+/-1.3 after surgery. The mean preoperative VBHL was 27.8+/-11.3% for the thoracic spine and 27.7+/-12.5% for the lumbar spine. VBHL values were reduced to 22.4+/-10.0% and 18.4+/-10.4% for the thoracic and lumbar spine after surgery, respectively. The segmental kyphosis angles decreased from 21.2+/-11.4 degrees to 17.0+/-9.8 degrees for the thoracic spine and from 15.3+/-8.8 degrees to 10.4+/-7.2 degrees for the lumbar spine after surgery. There was a correlation between the symptom duration and VBH restoration rate. There was no correlation between the amount of injected polymethylmethacrylate and pain relief. We concluded that kyphoplasty is a safe and effective procedure for treating painful vertebral body fractures caused by metastasis and multiple myeloma. It can restore VBH and correct the kyphosis angle. While the increased amount of the injected PMMA led to its leakage, it did not contribute to restoration of the VBH or kyphosis correction. Therefore, one should avoid injection of excessive amounts of PMMA.

Cold tolerance of the harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis in Europe. As an essential aspect of its invasive character in Europe, this study examined the cold hardiness of the harlequin ladybird Harmonia axyridis. This was done for field-collected populations in Belgium overwintering either in an unheated indoor or an outdoor hibernaculum. The supercooling point, lower lethal temperature and lower lethal time at 0 and -5 degrees C were determined. Possible seasonal changes were taken into account by monitoring the populations during each winter month. The supercooling point and lower lethal temperature remained relatively constant for the overwintering populations in the outdoor hibernaculum, ranging from -17.5 to -16.5 degrees C and -17.1 to -16.3 degrees C, respectively. In contrast, the supercooling point and lower lethal temperature of the population overwintering indoors clearly increased as the winter progressed, from -18.5 to -13.2 degrees C and -16.7 to -14.1 degrees C, respectively. A proportion of the individuals overwintering indoors could thus encounter problems surviving the winter due to premature activation at times when food is not available. The lower lethal time of field populations at 0 and -5 degrees C varied from 18 to 24 weeks and from 12 to 22 weeks, respectively. Morph type and sex had no influence on the cold hardiness of the overwintering adults. In addition, all cold tolerance parameters differed greatly between the laboratory population and field populations, implying that cold tolerance research based solely on laboratory populations may not be representative of field situations. We conclude from this study that the strong cold hardiness of H. axyridis in Europe may enable the species to establish in large parts of the continent.

ADAPTIVE OPTICS IMAGING OF FOVEAL SPARING IN GEOGRAPHIC ATROPHY SECONDARY TO AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION. To describe adaptive optics (AO) imaging of foveal sparing in geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration. Flood-illumination AO infrared (IR) fundus images were obtained in four consecutive patients with GA using an AO retinal camera (rtx1; Imagine Eyes). Adaptive optics IR images were overlaid with confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope near-IR autofluorescence images to allow direct correlation of en face AO features with areas of foveal sparing. Adaptive optics appearance of GA and foveal sparing, preservation of functional photoreceptors, and cone densities in areas of foveal sparing were investigated. In 5 eyes of 4 patients (all female; mean age 74.2 Â± 11.9 years), a total of 5 images, sized 4Â° Ã 4Â°, of foveal sparing visualized on confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope near-IR autofluorescence were investigated by AO imaging. En face AO images revealed GA as regions of inhomogeneous hyperreflectivity with irregularly dispersed hyporeflective clumps. By direct comparison with adjacent regions of GA, foveal sparing appeared as well-demarcated areas of reduced reflectivity with less hyporeflective clumps (mean 14.2 vs. 3.2; P = 0.03). Of note, in these areas, en face AO IR images revealed cone photoreceptors as hyperreflective dots over the background reflectivity (mean cone density 3,271 Â± 1,109 cones per square millimeter). Microperimetry demonstrated residual function in areas of foveal sparing detected by confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope near-IR autofluorescence. Adaptive optics allows the appreciation of differences in reflectivity between regions of GA and foveal sparing. Preservation of functional cone photoreceptors was demonstrated on en face AO IR images in areas of foveal sparing detected by confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope near-IR autofluorescence.


Genomic and Functional Portrait of a Highly Virulent, CTX-M-15-Producing H30-Rx Subclone of Escherichia coli Sequence Type 131.

[Influenza A (H1N1). fear of a pandemic]. As of July 1st 2009, 90300 cases of the new Influenza A (H1N1) have been officially reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) in more than 80 countries. Venezuela does not seem to be the exception, but it was not until June 11th 2009, when the first case was reported; however, the Venezuelan sanitary authorities maintain active the epidemiologic monitoring and controls to avoid the propagation of the virus. A positive aspect, in this instance, is that the world is better prepared to confront an influenza pandemic; but it is generally accepted that the preparation against a pandemic requires the participation, not only of the health sector, but of all society. There are many challenges in the present and in the future, for the production of an effective vaccine against this new strain of the virus, which will create a sense of hope for the people who have not yet been affected by this disease.


A complete mathematical study of a 3D model of heterogeneous and anisotropic glioma evolution.

A case of structure determination using pseudosymmetry. Here, a case is presented of an unusual structure determination which was facilitated by the use of pseudosymmetry. Group A streptococcus uses cysteine protease Mac-1 (also known as IdeS) to evade the host immune system. Native Mac-1 was crystallized in the orthorhombic space group P2(1)2(1)2. Surprisingly, crystals of the inactive C94A mutant of Mac-1 displayed monoclinic symmetry with space group P2(1), despite the use of native orthorhombic Mac-1 microcrystals for seeding. Attempts to solve the structure of the C94A mutant by MAD phasing in the monoclinic space group did not produce an interpretable map. The native Patterson map of the C94A mutant showed two strong peaks along the (1 0 1) diagonal, indicating possible translational pseudosymmetry in space group P2(1). Interestingly, one-third of the monoclinic reflections obeyed pseudo-orthorhombic P2(1)2(1)2 symmetry similar to that of the wild-type crystals and could be indexed and processed in this space group. The pseudo-orthorhombic and monoclinic unit cells were related by the following vector operations: a(m) = b(o) - c(o), b(m) = a(o) and c(m) = -2c(o) - b(o). The pseudo-orthorhombic subset of data produced good SAD phases, leading to structure determination with one monomer in the asymmetric unit. Subsequently, the structure of the Mac-1 mutant in the monoclinic form was determined by molecular replacement, which showed six molecules forming three translationally related dimers aligned along the (1 0 1) diagonal. Knowing the geometric relationship between the pseudo-orthorhombic and the monoclinic unit cells, all six molecules can be generated in the monoclinic unit cell directly without the use of molecular replacement. The current case provides a successful example of the use of pseudosymmetry as a powerful phase-averaging method for structure determination by anomalous diffraction techniques. In particular, a structure can be solved in a higher pseudosymmetry subcell in which an NCS operator becomes a crystallographic operator. The geometrical relationships between the subcell and parental cell can be used to generate a complete molecular representation of the parental asymmetric unit for refinement.

Teaching Quality Improvement in Graduate Medical Education: An Experiential and Team-Based Approach to the Acquisition of Quality Improvement Competencies. An emerging priority in medical education is the need to facilitate learners' acquisition of quality improvement (QI) competencies. Accreditation bodies in both Canada and the United States have included QI and patient safety in their core competencies. In 2010, the Department of Family Medicine at Queen's University designed a graduate medical education curriculum to engage residents in a clinical QI program that would meet accreditation requirements. Monthly didactic sessions were combined with an experiential, team-based QI project that aligned with existing clinic priorities. The curriculum spans the first year of residency and is divided into three stages: (1) Engaging, (2) Understanding, and (3) Improving and translating. In Stage 1, teams of residents select a clinical QI topic, engage stakeholders, and collect baseline data related to their topic. In Stage 2, they focus on understanding their problem, interpreting their results, and applying QI tools. In Stage 3, they develop change ideas, translate their knowledge, and prepare to hand over their project. This QI curriculum aided residents in effectively acquiring QI competencies and allowed them to experience real-world challenges, such as securing project buy-in, negotiating with peers, and developing solutions to problems. Unlike in many QI programs, residents learned how to improve quality rather than about QI; thus, they formed the necessary foundation to carry out QI work in the future. The curriculum will be evaluated using a knowledge assessment and satisfaction tool and postproject resident interviews. Facilitators will focus more on improving faculty develop ment in QI.

The toxic effects of formaldehyde on the nervous system.

IL-1beta modulate the Ca(2+)-activated big-conductance K channels (BK) via reactive oxygen species in cultured rat aorta smooth muscle cells. The large conductance Ca(2+)-activated K(+) (BK) channel, abundantly expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells, plays a critical role in controlling vascular tone. Activation of BK channels leads to membrane hyperpolarization and promotes vasorelaxation. BK channels are activated either by elevation of the intracellular Ca(2+) concentration or by membrane depolarization. It is also regulated by a diversity of vasodilators and vasoconstrictors. Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) is one of the cytokines that play important roles in the development and progression of a variety of cardiovascular diseases. The effects of IL-1beta on vascular reactivity are controversial, and little is known about the modulation of BK channel function by IL-1beta. In this study, we investigated how IL-1beta modulates BK channel function in cultured arterial smooth muscle cells (ASMCs), and examined the role of H(2)O(2) in the process. We demonstrated that IL-1beta had biphasic effects on BK channel function and membrane potential of ASMCs, that is both concentration and time dependent. IL-1beta increased BK channel-dependent K(+) current and hyperpolarized ASMCs when applied for 30 min. While long-term (24-48 h) treatment of IL-1beta resulted in decreased expression of alpha-subunit of BK channel, suppressed BK channel activity, decreased BK channel-dependent K(+) current and depolarization of the cells. H(2)O(2) scavenger catalase completely abolished the early effect of IL-1beta, while it only partly diminished the long-term effect of IL-1beta. These results may provide important molecular mechanisms for therapeutic strategies targeting BK channel in inflammation-related diseases.


Evidence for asymmetric intra substantia nigra functional connectivity-application to basal ganglia processing.

Computed tomographic, magnetic resonance imaging, and cross-sectional anatomic features of the manus in cadavers of dogs without forelimb disease. OBJECTIVE-To provide a detailed description of cross-sectional anatomic structures of the manus in canine cadavers in association with corresponding features in computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) images. SAMPLE POPULATION-7 cadavers of adult large-breed-type dogs (weight range, 25 to 30 kg) without forelimb disease. PROCEDURES-Forelimbs were removed from the cadavers within 4 hours after euthanasia and frozen. The right forelimbs of 3 cadavers were cut into 4-mm sections by use of a band saw; 1 limb each was sectioned in the transverse, dorsal, or sagittal plane. Sections were cleaned and then photographed. After thawing, transverse CT images of the right forelimbs of 3 additional cadavers were obtained, and the right forelimb of a seventh cadaver underwent MR imaging in the transverse, sagittal, and dorsal planes. The evaluated regions extended from the digits to the carpus. Features in CT and MR images that corresponded to clinically important anatomic structures in tissue sections were identified. RESULTS-For most of the anatomic structures evident in tissue sections, corresponding CT and MR imaging features were identified. Osseous and musculotendinous structures of the manus were readily detected in CT and MR images, whereas vascular structures were only rarely identified by use of the imaging techniques. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE-Results of the detailed assessment of anatomic structures of the canine manus in association with corresponding features in CT and MR images will facilitate detection of pathological conditions and be beneficial in planning surgical procedures for diseases of the manus in dogs.

Variations in gastric cancer care: a trend beyond racial disparities. Race is associated with patterns of presentation and survival outcomes of gastric cancer in the United States. However, the impact of race on the receipt of guideline-recommended care is not well characterized. By using current recommendations, the authors examined the association between race and guideline-recommended treatments and identified factors that are predictive of variations in gastric cancer care. By using the National Cancer Database for 1998 through 2005, 106,002 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma were identified. Multivariate analysis techniques were used to examine the association between race, the receipt of guideline-recommended care, and survival after adjusting for covariates. Although African-American and Hispanic patients were more likely to undergo adequate lymphadenectomy (> or =15 lymph nodes) and to receive care at comprehensive cancer centers and high-volume facilities (for all, P < or = .001), they were less likely to receive adjuvant multimodality therapy for American Joint Committee on Cancer stage IB through IV, lymph node-negative (M0) disease. Up to 60% of all patients who underwent gastrectomy failed to receive adequate lymphadenectomy and adjuvant multimodality therapy. The delivery of multimodality therapy varied significantly by stage and lymph node evaluation (P < or = .001). These findings persisted on our multivariate analyses, indicating that African-American and Hispanic patients received adequate lymph node evaluation (P < or = .001), whereas they were associated with receiving no adjuvant multimodality therapy (P < or = .025). There were significant variations in treatment for gastric cancer among ethnic groups in the United States. It was noteworthy that, although nonwhite race was associated with improved surgical care, gastric cancer care remained suboptimal overall. Cancer programs need to identify procedures to maximize the delivery of adequate gastric cancer care to all patients.

Neuroprotective activities of CEP-1347 in models of neuroAIDS. When the nervous system is infected with HIV-1, it commonly results in neuroinflammation leading to overt neuronal dysfunction and subsequent cognitive and behavioral impairments. The multifaceted disease process, now referred to as HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), provides a range of molecular targets for adjunctive therapies. One is CEP-1347, an inhibitor of mixed lineage kinases that elicits neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory responses in models of neurodegenerative diseases. Since HAND is associated with inflammatory encephalopathy induced by virus infection and mononuclear phagocytes (perivascular macrophages and microglia) immune activation, we investigated whether CEP-1347 could ameliorate disease in laboratory models of HAND. We now demonstrate that CEP-1347 reduces the levels of secreted proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in HIV-1-infected human macrophages and attenuates dose-dependent neurotoxicity in rodent cortical neurons. CEP-1347-treated mice readily achieve therapeutic drug levels in peripheral blood. HIV-1 encephalitis (HIVE) mice, where human virus-infected monocyte-derived macrophages are stereotactically injected into the basal ganglia of CB17 severe combined immunodeficient mice, received daily intraperitoneal injections of CEP-1347. Here, CEP-1347 treatment of HIVE mice showed a dose-dependent reduction in microgliosis. Dendritic integrity and neuronal loss were sustained and prevented, respectively. These results demonstrate that CEP-1347 elicits anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective responses in an HIVE model of human disease and as such warrants further study as an adjunctive therapy for human disease.

Synthesis and AChE inhibitory activity of new chiral tetrahydroacridine analogues from terpenic cyclanones. This work describes the enantioselective synthesis of a new series of terpenic chiral 9-aminotetrahydroacridine analogues. Several chiral ketones were synthesized from natural monoterpenes in an optically active form and subjected to the cyclodehydration reactions with anthranilonitrile in the presence of BF(3).Et(2)O as catalyst. The 9-aminotetrahydroacridine analogues were tested as acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors. Based on qualitative structure-activity relationship some trends are suggested.

The effects of iron(II) on the kinetics of arsenic oxidation and sorption on manganese oxides. In this study, As(III) oxidation kinetics by a poorly-crystalline phyllomanganate (Î´-MnO2) in the presence and absence of dissolved Fe(II) was investigated using stirred-flow and batch experiments. Chemically synthetic Î´-MnO2 was reacted with four influent solutions, containing the same As(III) concentration but different Fe(II) concentrations, at pH 6. The results show an initial rapid As(III) oxidation by Î´-MnO2, which is followed by an appreciably slow reaction after 8h. In the presence of Fe(II), As(III) oxidation is inhibited due to the competitive oxidation of Fe(II) as well as the formation of Fe(III)-(hydr)oxides on the Î´-MnO2 surface. However, the sorption of As(III), As(V) and Mn(II) are increased, for the newly formed Fe(III)-(hydr)oxides provide additional sorption sites. This study suggests that the competitive oxidation of Fe(II) and consequently the precipitation of Fe(III) compounds on the Î´-MnO2 surface play an important role in As(III) oxidation and As sequestration. Understanding these processes would be helpful in developing in situ strategies for remediation of As-contaminated waters and soils.

"An exophytic mandibular brown tumor": an unusual presentation of primary hyperparathyroidism. A case of 35-year-old male patient with previously undiagnosed primary hyperparathyroidism who presented with an atypical exophytic mandibular swelling is reported. The aim is to alert the clinicians to include this entity although extremely rare, in the differential diagnosis of swellings in the maxillofacial region and to highlight another remarkable aspect in the multitude of presentations associated with primary hyperparathyroidism especially in the setting of normocalcemia.

Perceiving emotions: Cueing social categorization processes and attentional control through facial expressions. Individuals spontaneously categorise other people on the basis of their gender, ethnicity and age. But what about the emotions they express? In two studies we tested the hypothesis that facial expressions are similar to other social categories in that they can function as contextual cues to control attention. In Experiment 1 we associated expressions of anger and happiness with specific proportions of congruent/incongruent flanker trials. We also created consistent and inconsistent category members within each of these two general contexts. The results demonstrated that participants exhibited a larger congruency effect when presented with faces in the emotional group associated with a high proportion of congruent trials. Notably, this effect transferred to inconsistent members of the group. In Experiment 2 we replicated the effects with faces depicting true and false smiles. Together these findings provide consistent evidence that individuals spontaneously utilise emotions to categorise others and that such categories determine the allocation of attentional control.

Optimisation and comparison of several microextraction/methylation methods for determining haloacetic acids in water using gas chromatography. This article presents the different modes and configurations of liquid-phase microextraction (LPME) through comparison with headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) for the simultaneous extraction/methylation of the nine haloacetic acids (HAAs) found in water. This is the first analytical case reported of solvent bar extraction-preconcentration-derivatisation assisted by an ion-pairing transfer for HAAs. In this method, 5 muL of the organic extractant, decane, was confined within a hollow-fibre membrane that was placed in a stirred aqueous sample containing the derivatising reagents (dimethylsulphate with a tetrabutylammonium salt). With heating at 45 degrees C in the HS-SPME method, some organic solvents (extractant, excess of derivatising reagent) are also volatilised and compete with the esters on the fibre (the fibre is damaged and it can be reused only 50-60 times). In addition, the HS-SPME method provides inadequate sensitivity (limits of detections between 0.3 and 5 microg/L) to quantify HAAs at the level usually found in drinking waters. Alternative headspace LPME methods for HAAs require heating (45 degrees C, 25 min) to derivatise and volatilise the esters but, by using solvent bar microextraction (SBME), the extraction/methylation takes place at room temperature without degradation of HAAs to trihalomethanes. Adequate precision (relative standard deviation of approximately 8%), linearity (0.1-500 microg/L) and sensitivity (10 times higher than the HS-SPME alternative) indicate that the SBME method can be a candidate for routine determination of HAAs in tap water. Finally, the SBME method was applied for the analysis of HAAs in tap and swimming pool water and the results were compared with those of a previous validated headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method.

Comparison of antiarrhythmics used in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation: subanalysis of J-RHYTHM Study. The J-RHYTHM (Japanese Rhythm Management Trial for Atrial Fibrillation) study demonstrated the benefit of rhythm-control compared with rate-control in Japanese patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF), according to AF-specific quality of life scores. However, detailed information on prescribed antiarrhythmic agents remains unclear. Data for 419 patients enrolled in the rhythm-control arm of J-RHYTHM were analyzed. The primary endpoint was defined as a composite of total mortality, cerebral infarction, embolism, bleeding, heart failure, and physical/psychological disability. The secondary endpoint was recurrence of AF. The clinical outcome according to choice of initial antiarrhythmic agent (AA) was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival curve, and further adjusted by Cox-regression hazard model. The primary endpoint occurred in 16.9%, 6.7%, 15.8% and 23.3% of patients assigned to class Ia, Ib, Ic and III agents (P=0.359). The rate of AF recurrence was significantly higher in patients taking a class III drug (Ia, Ib, Ic, III=20.3, 23.3, 29.1, 50.0%; P=0.002). However, after adjustment for other clinical variables, the choice of AA was not associated with recurrence of AF (class I vs III, P=0.15). The incidence of each endpoint did not differ according to the choice of AA. The class III drugs seemed to lower the sinus rhythm maintenance rate, which might be confounded by other comorbid conditions. (Circ J 2010; 74: 71 - 76).

Transfer function analysis of baroreflex function in a rabbit model of endotoxic shock. Sepsis is characterized by profound cardiovascular abnormalities which may result from the derangements in the arterial baroreflex system and other autonomic regulatory functions. In this study, a mechanically ventilated and anesthetized rabbit model of endotoxic shock was utilized to mimic the behaviors of the cardiovascular system in a sepsis patient. 13 adult New Zealand white rabbits were studied, with 8 of them injected with endotoxin and the remaining given saline solution as sham fluid. Measurements of heart period (RRi) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) were obtained pre-and post-intervention after a 90 minute period, which allowed spectral and cross-spectral analysis of heart rate and blood pressure variabilities to be performed. A significant increase of blood lactate level (p < 0.01) in post-intervention stage signified the onset of distributive shock. Based on this model, the novel findings were that in the low frequency (LF) and mid frequency (MF) bands, there was a decrease in coherence (p < 0.01 and p < 0.05 respectively) and loss of phase delay (p < 0.05) between SBP and RRi, along with a depression in transfer function gain in the LF band (p < 0.05), which might indicate an impairment of baroreflex control of heart rate following the administration of endotoxin. None of the above variables changed significantly in the control group. Moreover, endotoxin also led to a decrease in RRi variability in the ventilatory frequency (VF) band, suggesting a suppression of cardiac vagal modulation. These results highlight the potential value of frequency spectrum analysis combined with transfer function analysis of cardiovascular variability in the assessment of autonomic and baroreflex-related changes associated with endotoxic shock.

Usefulness of noninvasive tests in nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. The only way to diagnose nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH) is liver biopsy. To evaluate in a prospective study the performance of noninvasive liver investigations in patients with NRH. All consecutive patients with NRH who were being followed up in our unit from 2004 to 2007 were included. All biopsy specimens were reanalysed independently to confirm the diagnosis of NRH (classified as certain or probable) and to assess portal or sinusoidal associated fibrosis. All patients had liver stiffness (using FibroScan) and FibroTest measurements. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed using two contrast agents (gadolinium-chelate and ferucarbotran). Thirty patients were included (mean age: 53 years). Median liver stiffness value was 7.9 kPa (range: 3.5-16.8), with 63% of the patients having more than 7.1 kPa. No relationship was found between NRH with or without portal hypertension and liver stiffness or Fibrotest. No correlation was found between liver stiffness and portal and/or sinusoidal fibrosis. In patients studied with MRI, 55% had portal hypertension and 9% a diffuse fine-nodular loss of iron uptake after ferucarbotran injection. Liver stiffness and FibroTest values may be increased in NRH patients, with no correlation with portal hypertension or portal and sinusoidal fibrosis. Contrast-enhanced MRI is disappointing in NRH.

Development of a multispectral tissue characterization system for optimization of an implantable perfusion status monitor for transplanted liver. Optimizing wavelength selection for monitoring perfusion during liver transplant requires an in-depth characterization of liver optical properties. With these, the impact of liver absorption and scattering properties can be investigated to select optimal wavelengths for perfusion monitoring. To accomplish this, we are developing a single integrating-sphere-based technique using a unique spatially resolved diffuse reflectance system for multispectral optical properties determination for thick samples. We report early results using a monochromatic source to measure the optical properties of well characterized tissue phantoms made from polystyrene spheres and Trypan blue. The presented results demonstrate the feasibility of using this unique system to measure optical properties of tissue phantoms. We are currently in the process of implementing an automated Levenberg-Marquardt diffuse-reflectance-profile fitting algorithm to enable near realtime robust computation of sample optical properties. Future work will focus on the incorporation of multispectral capability to provide needed data to facilitate development of more realistic liver tissue phantoms.

Prevention of osteoporosis in mice after ovariectomy via allograft of microencapsulated ovarian cells. It is believed that estrogen deficiency is one of the major risk factors associated with osteoporosis. To investigate the effects of the transplantation of microencapsulated ovarian cells in estrogen-deficient mice, ovarian cells from female Kunming (KM) mice (6-weeks old) were separated, cultured, and microencapsulated with alginic acid-polylysine-alginic acid. Female KM mice (8-weeks old) were randomly separated into three groups: intact (normal), ovariectomized (OVX), and treatment (OVX+ implantation). Microencapsulated ovarian cells were found to secrete estrogen at normal levels in vitro. Ninety days after transplantation, serum estradiol levels in the OVX group were significantly lower, and the trabecular bone amount and volume were decreased when compared with the normal group. The expression of alkaline phosphatase in chondrocytes appeared lower, while the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) in the bone matrix was higher. The ratio of MMP-9-positive chondrocytes and osteoblasts to osteoclasts was significantly lower than that of the normal group. The concentrations of hydroxyproline (Hyp), Ca, and P in the left femurs of the OVX group were lower than those of the normal group. However, the aforementioned changes were not seen in the treatment group. In conclusion, microencapsulated ovarian cells survive well after transplantation and secrete estrogen in vivo, and they can prevent in some degree osteoporosis caused by ovariectomy.

Development and validation of the Nightingale Symptom Assessment Scale (N-SAS) and predictors of the quality of life of the cancer patients in Turkey. Treatment-related side effects have an adverse impact on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. This study is a description of the validity and responsiveness demonstrated by a new cancer and cancer treatment-specific symptom scale--the Nightingale Symptom Assessment Scale (N-SAS)--which was developed and validated to address the QoL of Turkish cancer patients. The comprehensiveness and clarity of the scale was assessed using 10 patients and pilot testing was carried out with 179 patients. A sample of 374 cancer patients who had received chemotherapy participated in the main study. Descriptive statistics were calculated and comparative tests and factor analysis were performed. The internal reliability of N-SAS was examined and the validity of this scale was determined by correlation with FACT-G. The scale showed high internal reliability, Cronbach's Î± for the subscales varied between 0.81 and 0.87 and was 0.93 for the tool. Longitudinal analyses showed that changes in N-SAS scores were strongly correlated with changes in FACT-G. Multivariate analysis revealed that having a metastatic cancer diagnosis, having a low level of income, receiving taxane-based therapy and being a woman were the most important predictive factors for the well-being of the cancer patients in this study. The high correlation with the FACT-G suggests that the new scale is a valid instrument that can be used to evaluate the effect of antineoplastic therapies on a cancer patient's QoL and can help guide nursing care as well as track the improvement of patients' HRQoL.

Postoperative Complications After Prophylactic Thyroidectomy for Very Young Patients With Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2: Retrospective Cohort Analysis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether younger age at surgery is associated with the increased incidence of postoperative complications after prophylactic thyroidectomy in pediatric patients with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2. The shift toward earlier thyroidectomy has resulted in significantly less medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC)-related morbidity and mortality. However, very young pediatric patients might have a higher morbidity rate compared with older patients. Hardly any literature exists on complications in the very young. A retrospective single-center analysis was performed on the outcomes of MEN2 patients undergoing a prophylactic total thyroidectomy at the age of 17 or younger. Forty-one MEN2A and 3 MEN2B patients with thyroidectomy after January 1993 and at least 6 months of follow-up were included, subdivided in 9 patients younger than 3 years, 15 patients 3 to 6 years, and 20 patients older than 6 years. Postoperative hypocalcemia and other complications were registered. Twelve (27%) patients developed transient hypocalcemia and 9 (20%) patients suffered from permanent hypocalcemia, with a nonsignificant trend toward higher incidence with decreasing age. Three (7%) patients had other complications, of whom 2 were younger than 3 years. For patients younger than 3 years, the average length of stay (LOS) was 6.7 days, versus 1.7 and 3.5 days, respectively, for the older patient groups (P < 0.05). Patients with complications had a longer LOS compared with patients without (5.0 vs 2.0, P < 0.01). None of the patients had clinical signs of recurrent MTC after a mean follow-up of 10.5 years. Prophylactic thyroidectomy in very young children is associated with a higher rate of complications, causing a significant increased LOS. Irrespective age of surgery, MTC did not recur in any patient. In planning optimal timing of surgery, clinicians should take the risk of complications into account. We advise not to perform total thyroidectomy before the age of 3 for patients defined high risk by the American Thyroid Association guideline.

[Endoscopic surveillance of colon-rectum in the narrow band imaging era]. Colonoscopic surveillance is an established method of colorectal cancer (CRC) screening that reduces death rates, but has an adenoma miss rate of 10-20%. Narrow band imaging (NBI), a novel endoscopic technology, highlights superficial mucosal capillaries and improves contrast for small adenomas. This study evaluated the role of NBI in the improving colon adenoma detection. White light colonoscope was compared with NBI for adenoma detection during colonoscopy. 120 patients presenting for diagnostic colonoscopy were randomly assigned to undergo colonoscopy using either conventional white light or NBI colonscope during instrument withdrawal. The outcome parameter was the difference in the adenoma detection rate between the two techniques. All polyps detected were removed for histopathological analysis. Adenomas were detected more frequently in the NBI group (51) than in the control group (49); however, the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.128). The extubation time was significatively longer in the NBI group (p = 0.003). In our experience, the NBI did not increased the adenomas detection rate compared to white light by an endoscopist with a known high detection rate using white light.

Clinical characteristics and predictors of mortality in patients with Enterobacter aerogenes bacteremia. Enterobacter aerogenes is increasingly encountered in nosocomial infections. This study aimed to clarify the clinical characteristics and to identify the predictors of mortality in patients with E. aerogenes bacteremia. From March 2001 to April 2007, all patients with positive blood cultures for E. aerogenes at Taipei Veterans General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan, were enrolled in this retrospective study. The medical records were reviewed for clinical and laboratory data. Eighty eight patients were included, 9 (10.2%) of whom died of E. aerogenes bacteremia. Most of the patients had comorbidities. Seventy nine patients (89.8%) had nosocomial infections, and 43 patients (48.9%) had polymicrobial infections. Eighty four patients (95.5%) presented with fever. Empirical antimicrobial therapy was administered for 80 patients (90.9%), but was appropriate for only 55 patients (62.5%). Of the 9 patients who died, 8 had polymicrobial infection, 5 of whom had nosocomial pneumonia, and 6 did not receive appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Multivariate analysis indicated that high Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (>16) [odds ratio (OR), 16.569; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.24-221.24; p = 0.034] and strains not susceptible to extended-spectrum cephalosporins (OR, 9.21; 95% CI, 1.02-83.04; p = 0.048) were independent risk factors for mortality. The severity of E. aerogenes bacteremia, reflected by high APACHE II score and isolation of strains with no susceptibility to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, were independent risk factors for mortality. Patients with severe illness and isolates resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins should be treated with more potent antimicrobial agents.

Scientific publications in anesthesiology journals from mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong: a 10-year survey of the literature. The past 20 yr have seen significant growth in China's role in the international community. This same growth and international presence is occurring in the field of anesthesiology. The research status in anesthesiology among Chinese individuals in the 3 major regions of China--mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan--is unknown. We analyzed articles published in peer-reviewed international anesthesiology journals cited by both PubMed and Science Citation Index from these 3 regions. Articles published in 21 journals in anesthesiology originating from mainland China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong from 1999 to 2008 were retrieved from the PubMed database and the Science Citation Index. The number of total articles, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, impact factors, citations, and articles published in "high-impact" journals were tabulated to assess both the quantity and quality of research arising from China. From 1999 to 2008 there were 721 articles published in high-impact anesthesiology journals from China, including 204 from mainland China, 317 from Taiwan, and 200 from Hong Kong. The number of articles published each year increased from 50 published in 1999 to 101 published in 2008. From 2005 onward, the number of articles published from mainland China exceeded that from Hong Kong and in 2008 mainland China exceeded Taiwan. The average impact factor of the articles was similar for mainland China (2.84), Taiwan (2.41), and Hong Kong (2.16). The total citations to articles from Taiwan (2376) exceeded citations to articles from mainland China (1143) and Hong Kong (1540). Anesthesia & Analgesia published more articles than any other journal from all 3 regions. The total number of articles from China published in highly cited anesthesiology journals increased markedly from 1999 to 2008, with articles from mainland China increasing substantially after 2004, whereas the number of publications from Hong Kong decreased. The average impact factor was similar for all 3 regions, ranging from 2.2 to 2.8. Anesthesia & Analgesia published more articles from Chinese authors from all 3 regions than any other journal.

Role of supplementary eye field in saccade initiation: executive, not direct, control. The goal of this study was to determine whether the activity of neurons in the supplementary eye field (SEF) is sufficient to control saccade initiation in macaque monkeys performing a saccade countermanding (stop signal) task. As previously observed, many neurons in the SEF increase the discharge rate before saccade initiation. However, when saccades are canceled in response to a stop signal, effectively no neurons with presaccadic activity display discharge rate modulation early enough to contribute to saccade cancellation. Moreover, SEF neurons do not exhibit a specific threshold discharge rate that could trigger saccade initiation. Yet, we observed more subtle relations between SEF activation and saccade production. The activity of numerous SEF neurons was correlated with response time and varied with sequential adjustments in response latency. Trials in which monkeys canceled or produced a saccade in a stop signal trial were distinguished by a modest difference in discharge rate of these SEF neurons before stop signal or target presentation. These findings indicate that neurons in the SEF, in contrast to counterparts in the frontal eye field and superior colliculus, do not contribute directly and immediately to the initiation of visually guided saccades. However the SEF may proactively regulate saccade production by biasing the balance between gaze-holding and gaze-shifting based on prior performance and anticipated task requirements.

Comparison of ivabradine versus metoprolol in early phases of reperfused anterior myocardial infarction with impaired left ventricular function: preliminary findings. beta-blockers in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) are indicated for patients without a contraindication, particularly in patients with high heart rates (HR) or blood pressures. Epidemiological studies have shown that elevated HR represents a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity. The study investigates the feasibility, tolerability, and the effects after 30 days of follow-up of ivabradine (IVA) versus metoprolol (METO) in early phases of anterior STEMI reperfused by percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients with a first anterior STEMI, Killip class I-II, an acceptable echocardiographic window, and admitted within 4hours of the onset of symptoms, with an ejection fraction <50%. METO or IVA, 12hours after PCI (double blind), were administered twice per day. Blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG), and laboratory parameters were monitored during the study. At entry, day 10, day 30, and day 60, by echocardiography, the ESV, EDV, E/A ratio, E wave deceleration time, isovolumetric relaxation time were measured. A total of 155 (50 females, 105 males) patients were randomized in 2 groups: a group received METO (76 patients) 12hours after PCI and a group received IVA (79 patients) 12hours after PCI. The 2 groups were similar for clinical characteristics. No difference was evidenced in HR, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, age (range, 39-73 years), sex, ejection fraction (EF), creatine kinase peak, between the 2 groups at entry. Both groups were similar for time to angiography and interventional procedures and number of vessels diseased. IVA group: the 79 patients showed 2 side effects and 5 readmissions: 4 for ischemic events and 1 for heart failure, and 1 sudden death; METO group: the 76 patients had 4 ischemic events, 2 side effects, and 1 patient died during re-acute MI (intrastent thrombosis) and 8 readmissions for heart failure signs. The systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure showed a significant reduction in both groups, P < .0001, respectively), and significant lower values were observed in METO group, P=.0001). The HR was significantly reduced in both groups, P < .0001). IVA group showed a significant increase in EF, P=.0001, with concomitant reduction in ESV and EDV (P=.0001, and .048, respectively). The diastolic parameters were similar in both groups during study period. Our results suggest that ivabradine may be administered early (12hours after PCI) to patients with successful PCI for anterior STEMI with an impaired left ventricular function and high HR and sinus rhythm. A larger sample of patients and further studies are required to evaluate the effects of ivabradine on clinical end points.


The spatial and temporal shape of oculomotor inhibition.

Aqueous extract of Carica papaya leaves exhibits anti-tumor activity and immunomodulatory effects. Various parts of Carica papaya Linn. (CP) have been traditionally used as ethnomedicine for a number of disorders, including cancer. There have been anecdotes of patients with advanced cancers achieving remission following consumption of tea extract made from CP leaves. However, the precise cellular mechanism of action of CP tea extracts remains unclear. The aim of the present study is to examine the effect of aqueous-extracted CP leaf fraction on the growth of various tumor cell lines and on the anti-tumor effect of human lymphocytes. In addition, we attempted to identify the functional molecular weight fraction in the CP leaf extract. The effect of CP extract on the proliferative responses of tumor cell lines and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and cytotoxic activities of PBMC were assessed by [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation. Flow cytometric analysis and measurement of caspase-3/7 activities were performed to confirm the induction of apoptosis on tumor cells. Cytokine productions by PBMC were measured by ELISA. Gene profiling of the effect of CP extract treatment was performed by microarray analysis and real-time RT-PCR. We observed significant growth inhibitory activity of the CP extract on tumor cell lines. In PBMC, the production of IL-2 and IL-4 was reduced following the addition of CP extract, whereas that of IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha was enhanced without growth inhibition. In addition, cytotoxicity of activated PBMC against K562 was enhanced by the addition of CP extract. Moreover, microarray analyses showed that the expression of 23 immunomodulatory genes, classified by gene ontology analysis, was enhanced by the addition of CP extract. In this regard, CCL2, CCL7, CCL8 and SERPINB2 were representative of these upregulated genes, and thus may serve as index markers of the immunomodulatory effects of CP extract. Finally, we identified the active components of CP extract, which inhibits tumor cell growth and stimulates anti-tumor effects, to be the fraction with M.W. less than 1000. Since Carica papaya leaf extract can mediate a Th1 type shift in human immune system, our results suggest that the CP leaf extract may potentially provide the means for the treatment and prevention of selected human diseases such as cancer, various allergic disorders, and may also serve as immunoadjuvant for vaccine therapy.

Targeting of IL-2 receptor with a caspase fusion protein disrupts autoimmunity in prediabetic and diabetic NOD mice. Interruption of IL-2 signalling is an attractive therapeutic target in autoimmune disorders. In this study we evaluated the effect of a fusion protein composed of IL-2 and caspase-3 (IL2-cas) on NOD mice, as compared with disease induction by cyclophosphamide. IL2-cas was assessed in NOD mice at various ages and in conjunction with cyclophosphamide administration. The effect of IL2-cas on diabetogenic cells was evaluated in adoptive transfer experiments and in cell suspension in vitro. IL2-cas induced apoptosis in T cells expressing the alpha chain of the IL-2 receptor (cluster of differentiation [CD]25) in vitro, with superior survival of T cells expressing CD4 and forkhead box P3 (FOXP3). The fusion protein decreased mixed lymphocyte reactivity, and pretreatment with IL2-cas decreased the efficacy of adoptive transfer of diabetes into NOD severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Administration of one dose of IL2-cas decreased the incidence of diabetes in NOD mice, showing a superior beneficial effect when administered at young age, and effectively blocked induction of hyperglycaemia by cyclophosphamide, reducing the severity of islet inflammation. Administration of IL2-cas caused an acute increase in CD25(-)FOXP3(+) T cells in the lymph nodes, pancreas and thymus in NOD mice, with similar effects in wild-type mice. Administration of IL2-cas after onset of hyperglycaemia resulted in superior survival. Targeted elimination of cells expressing the IL-2 receptor by this fusion protein disrupts the autoimmune pathogenesis in prediabetic and diabetic NOD mice, despite depletion of CD25(+) regulatory T cells. Furthermore, this particular fusion protein is permissive to the development of FOXP3(+) T cells that might contribute to protracted protection from the progression of insulitis and overt hyperglycaemia.


Zebrafish (Danio rerio): A Potential Model for Toxinological Studies.

The impact of landscape disturbance on spatial genetic structure in the Guanacaste tree, Enterolobium cyclocarpum (Fabaceae). We examined spatial genetic structure (SGS) in Enterolobium cyclocarpum (the Guanacaste tree), a dominant tree of Central American dry forests in 4 sites in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica. In disturbed dry forest sites (e.g., pastures), E. cyclocarpum is primarily dispersed by cattle and horses, whose movements are restricted by pasture boundaries. The study sites varied in tree densities and disturbance. Allozyme analyses of adult trees demonstrated significant levels of SGS in 3 of 4 sites. SGS was primarily due to clusters of young adults located along seasonal streams, rocky areas, and in abandoned pastures. SGS was highest in the first distance class in the least disturbed population, which also had the lowest density of large adults. Low, but significant SGS characterized the site with the highest number of large adults located in individual pastures. The semiurban site, had no clusters of young adults and, probably as a result, failed to exhibit SGS. Our results demonstrate that disturbance can strongly influence SGS patterns and are consistent with a landscape model in which the location of potential recruitment sites, restricted seed disperser movements, and the number and location of maternal individuals dictate the level and pattern of SGS.

Reversine enhances generation of progenitor-like cells by dedifferentiation of annulus fibrosus cells.

Simvastatin treatment duration and cognitive preservation in experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage. Cognitive dysfunction, a significant complication after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), affects up to 60% of survivors. We hypothesized that oral simvastatin would improve vestibulomotor function and reduce cognitive dysfunction after experimental SAH in the rat, and explored the effects of simvastatin on vasospasm and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). In total 160 rats were enrolled. Randomization to simvastatin or vehicle occurred after double intracisternal blood injections. Effects of simvastatin 10 mg/kg/d (SV10), simvastatin 1.5 mg/kg/d, or vehicle on rotarod, Morris water maze, neuronal survival, cerebral arterial diameter, and rCBF were determined by a blinded observer (n=15/group). A dose dependent response to simvastatin was observed, with more rapid improvement in vestibulomotor function, less basilar arterial vasospasm, and improved cortical neuronal survival with SV10. However, rotarod performance in the SV10 group deteriorated after 1 week, which correlated with the increased plasma creatine kinase levels (r=-0.737; P=0.0002). Furthermore, when simvastatin was discontinued after 2 weeks, the usual treatment duration in SAH clinical trials, rotarod performance deteriorated acutely, rCBF returned to control values, and no long-term benefit was observed in terms of visual spatial memory. Continuing simvastatin 1.5 mg/kg/d for 5 weeks resulted in sustained improvement in rotarod performance, reduced escape latency (P=0.001), swimming distance (P=0.002), and swimming speed (P=0.03) versus vehicle (n=12/group). Our results indicate that long-term cognitive dysfunction after experimental SAH in the rat can be reduced by simvastatin. However, treatment had to be extended beyond 2 weeks, the traditional risk period for angiographic vasospasm, to improve long-term outcome.

Surgical treatment of primary intracranial myxoma in a child following radiotherapy: case report and review of the literature. Myxomas are benign tumors of the mesenchymal origin and account for about half of the benign cardiac tumors. Occasionally, they occur at other locations, but the intracranial manifestation of a myxoma is exceptionally rare. As a secondary neoplasia following radiotherapy, myxoma has only been reported once in the literature. A 12-year-old girl, who was previously treated for a medulloblastoma, was diagnosed with a new lesion at the left transverse sinus in the follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Indication for surgery was made and complete removal could be achieved. Histological examination revealed a myxoma. Further staging showed no other manifestation of the myxoma. The close relation to the radiation field of the posterior fossa makes it highly suggestive that the myxoma developed as a secondary neoplasia induced by radiotherapy. Treatment philosophy for this benign tumor entity is a completed resection of the lesion with regular follow-up MRI.

Resolution of sleep-disordered breathing with a biventricular assist device and recurrence after heart transplantation. Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is common in chronic heart failure. Both obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and central sleep apnea with periodic Cheyne-Stokes respiration (CSA-CSR) can occur. CSA-CSR is believed to correlate with heart function. Little information exists about the impact of mechanical assist devices and heart transplantation on SDB in patients with end-stage heart failure. Here, we describe, for the first time, the effects on SDB of a biventricular external assist device and of heart transplantation used successively in the same patient.


Higher pneumococcal disease vaccination rates needed to protect more at-risk US adults.

Self-stigma, group identification, perceived legitimacy of discrimination and mental health service use. Stigma may interfere with mental health service use. We measured self-stigma and stigma-related cognitions (group identification and perceived legitimacy of discrimination) at baseline in 85 people with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or affective disorders. After 6 months, 75 (88%) had reported use of mental health services. Controlling for baseline psychopathology, perceived stigma and diagnosis, low perceived legitimacy of discrimination predicted use of counselling/psychotherapy. Strong group identification was associated with participation in mutual-help groups. More self-stigma predicted psychiatric hospitalisation. Cognitive indicators of stigma resilience may predict out-patient service use, whereas self-stigma may increase the risk of psychiatric hospitalisation.

Cataract surgery and diabetes. Recent studies have focused on interventions to minimize progression of retinal disease in diabetic patients undergoing cataract surgery. Here, we review the evidence for progression of diabetic retinal disease with cataract surgery and critically analyze the interventions proposed to minimize it. Peri-operative intravitreal bevacizumab, sub-Tenon's triamcinolone, and panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) after cataract surgery (instead of before) have been examined as ways to improve cataract surgery results in diabetic patients. The bevacizumab and triamcinolone results are promising, but the inclusion criteria are variable, the sample sizes are small, and the follow-up is short. Postsurgery PRP shows improved cataract surgery results in diabetics with more severe retinopathy up to 1 year after surgery. Recent studies do not support the generalized conclusion that phacoemulsification surgery causes progression of retinopathy and macular edema in all diabetic patients. In certain populations of diabetic patients undergoing cataract surgery, peri-operative triamcinolone and bevacizumab may blunt the progression of diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy. The optimal timing of PRP in relation to cataract surgery in patients with more severe retinopathy warrants further evaluation.

Diagnosis and management of chronic rhinosinusitis in adults. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is characterized by mucosal inflammation affecting both the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses; its causes are potentially numerous, disparate, and frequently overlapping. The more common conditions that are associated with CRS are perennial allergic and nonallergic rhinitis, nasal polyps, and anatomical mechanical obstruction (septum/turbinate issues). Other less common etiologies include inflammation (eg, from superantigens), fungal sinusitis or bacterial sinusitis with or without associated biofilm formation, gastroesophageal reflux, smoke and other environmental exposures, immune deficiencies, genetics, and aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease. A diagnosis of CRS is strongly suggested by a history of symptoms (eg, congestion and/or fullness; nasal obstruction, blockage, discharge, and/or purulence; discolored postnasal discharge; hyposmia/anosmia; facial pain and/or pressure) and their duration for > 3 months. A definitive diagnosis requires physical evidence of mucosal swelling or discharge appreciated during physical examination coupled with CT imaging if inflammation does not involve the middle meatus or ethmoid bulla. Multivariant causation makes the diagnosis of CRS and selection of treatment complex. Furthermore, various types of health care providers including ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialists, allergists, primary care physicians, and pulmonologists treat CRS, and each is likely to have a different approach. A structured approach to the diagnosis and management of CRS can help streamline and standardize care no matter where patients present for evaluation and treatment. A 2008 Working Group on CRS in Adults, supported by the American Academy of Otolaryngic Allergy (AAOA), developed a series of algorithms for the differential diagnosis and treatment of CRS in adults, based on the evolving understanding of CRS as an inflammatory disease. The algorithms presented in this paper address an approach for all CRS patients as well as approaches for those with nasal polyps, edema observed on nasal endoscopy, purulence observed on nasal endoscopy, an abnormal history and physical examination, and an abnormal history and normal physical examination.


In vivo morphological changes in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and Alzheimer's-like disease: MRI approach.

Association between pelvic floor muscle trauma and pelvic organ prolapse 20 years after delivery. It is known that pelvic floor muscle trauma (PFMT) after vaginal delivery is associated with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) symptoms (sPOP) and signs (POP-Q â¥2) in patient populations. Our aims were to establish the prevalence and investigate a possible association between PFMT and sPOP and POP-Q â¥2 in healthy women 20 years after their first delivery. During 2013 and 2014 we conducted a cross-sectional study among 847 women who delivered their first child between 1990 and 1997. Women responded to a postal questionnaire and were offered a clinical examination including prolapse grading and pelvic floor ultrasonography. The main outcome measures were sPOP, POP-Q â¥2 and PFMT, defined by levator avulsion or a levator hiatal area on Valsalva manoeuvre of >40 cm(2) on ultrasonography. Of the 847 eligible women, 608 (72 %) were examined. Data on POP symptoms, POP-Q stage, levator avulsion and levator hiatal area were available in 598, 608, 606 and 554 women, respectively, and of these 75 (13%) had sPOP, 275 (45%) had POP-Q â¥2, 113 (19 %) had levator avulsion and 164 (30%) had a levator hiatal area >40 cm(2). Levator avulsion was associated with POP-Q â¥2 with an odds ratio (OR) of 9.91 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.73 - 17.13, and with sPOP (OR 2.28, 95% CI 1.34 - 3.91). Levator hiatal area >40 cm(2) was associated with POP-Q â¥2 (OR 6.98, 95% CI 4.54, - 10.74) and sPOP (OR 3.28, 95 % CI 1.96 - 5.50). Many healthy women selected from the general population have symptoms and signs of POP 20 years after their first delivery, and PFMT is associated with POP-Q â¥2 and sPOP.


Directed evolution of chemotaxis inhibitory protein of Staphylococcus aureus generates biologically functional variants with reduced interaction with human antibodies.

Valence modulates source memory for faces. Previous studies in which the effects of emotional valence on old-new discrimination and source memory have been examined have yielded highly inconsistent results. Here, we present two experiments showing that old-new face discrimination was not affected by whether a face was associated with disgusting, pleasant, or neutral behavior. In contrast, source memory for faces associated with disgusting behavior (i.e., memory for the disgusting context in which the face was encountered) was consistently better than source memory for other types of faces. This data pattern replicates the findings of studies in which descriptions of cheating, neutral, and trustworthy behavior were used, which findings were previously ascribed to a highly specific cheater detection module. The present results suggest that the enhanced source memory for faces of cheaters is due to a more general source memory advantage for faces associated with negative or threatening contexts that may be instrumental in avoiding the negative consequences of encounters with persons associated with negative or threatening behaviors.


Development of a haemolysin gene-based multiplex PCR for simultaneous detection of Vibrio campbellii, Vibrio harveyi and Vibrio parahaemolyticus.

Recent progress of highly efficient in vivo biological screening for novel agrochemicals in China. This paper describes the recent progress of in vivo biological screening for pesticides in China. According to the criteria, including the severity of damage caused by pests and the economic value of the crops, the investigated insects, pathogens, herbs and other species in the agricultural field were selected as the main screening targets for pesticides. Corresponding in vivo microscreening methods have been established and applied in the pesticide screening procedure, which has higher reproducibility, a shorter time and greater efficiency that offset the drawbacks of conventional methods for pesticide screening.


Unsafe abortion and abortion care in Khartoum, Sudan.

Understanding omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. Current intakes of very long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), are low in most individuals living in Western countries. A good natural source of these fatty acids is seafood, especially oily fish. Fish oil capsules contain these fatty acids also. Very long-chain omega-3 fatty acids are readily incorporated from capsules into transport (blood lipids), functional (cell and tissue), and storage (adipose) pools. This incorporation is dose-dependent and follows a kinetic pattern that is characteristic for each pool. At sufficient levels of incorporation, EPA and DHA influence the physical nature of cell membranes and membrane protein-mediated responses, lipid-mediator generation, cell signaling, and gene expression in many different cell types. Through these mechanisms, EPA and DHA influence cell and tissue physiology and the way cells and tissues respond to external signals. In most cases the effects seen are compatible with improvements in disease biomarker profiles or health-related outcomes. As a result, very long-chain omega-3 fatty acids play a role in achieving optimal health and in protection against disease. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids not only protect against cardiovascular morbidity but also against mortality. In some conditions, for example rheumatoid arthritis, they may be beneficial as therapeutic agents. On the basis of the recognized health improvements brought about by long-chain omega-3 fatty acids, recommendations have been made to increase their intake. The plant omega-3 fatty acid, alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), can be converted to EPA, but conversion to DHA appears to be poor in humans. Effects of ALA on human health-related outcomes appear to be due to conversion to EPA, and since this is limited, moderately increased consumption of ALA may be of little benefit in improving health outcomes compared with increased intake of preformed EPA + DHA.

Mature and functional viral miRNAs transcribed from novel RNA polymerase III promoters. Murid herpesvirus 4 (MuHV-4) microRNAs were previously cloned from latently infected tumor cells and predicted to be processed from a series of RNA polymerase III primary transcripts. We detected maturely processed MuHV-4 miRNAs within total RNA from lytically infected cells in vitro and infected tissues ex vivo, using a highly sensitive reverse ligation meditated RT-PCR strategy. We determined that the MuHV-4 microRNAs are biologically active during infection by a luciferase reporter system. We experimentally demonstrated that transcription of the MuHV-4 microRNAs is by RNA polymerase III by alpha-amanitin insensitivity and by specific deletion of the RNA polymerase III type 2-like promoter elements of MuHV-4, resulting in the complete loss of miRNA detection and function. Finally, we demonstrate that these 10 viral miRNAs, each transcribed from highly conserved and novel polymerase III promoter elements, vary markedly in their relative abundance and activity.

Introduction of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in Belgium, 2007-2008. This paper documents the progress of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine introduction in Belgium. Information on vaccine use is based on sales statistics and reimbursement claims. From November 2007 to November 2008, the National Institute for Health and Disability Insurance reimbursed the HPV vaccine for girls aged between 12-15 years. In December 2008, the age limit was extended to include girls up to the age of 18. In November 2008, the total number of HPV vaccines sold exceeded 530,000 doses. The number of vaccines reimbursed in Belgium, for the period November 2007-November 2008, corresponds to the amount required to fully vaccinate 44% of all girls aged between 12-15 years. However, the trend was decreasing over the last 10 months. By the current reimbursement policy, we can expect that maximum half of the target population can be reached. In Flanders (one of the three Communities in Belgium), the intention is to start, from September 2010, with a free school-based HPV immunisation for girls in the first year of secondary school (12 years of age), complemented with vaccination by a physician of choice. This strategy ensures a higher HPV vaccine coverage which is expected to be as high as the current coverage in the hepatitis B vaccination programme (approximately 80%) offered to boys and girls in the same age group and under the same circumstances.

Effect of Buguzhi (Psoralea corylifolia fruit) extract on bone formation. The objective of the study is to compare the amount of new bone produced by Buguzhi (Psoralea corylifolia fruit) extract in collagen matrix to that produced and collagen matrix in vivo. Eighteen bone defects, 5 mm by 10 mm, were created in the parietal bone of 9 New Zealand white rabbits. Six defects were grafted with Buguzhi extract mixed with collagen matrix. Six defects were grafted with collagen matrix alone (positive control) and 6 were left empty (negative control). Animals were sacrificed on day 14 and the defects were dissected and prepared for histological assessment. Quantitative analysis of new bone formation and bone cells was made on 100 sections (50 sections for each group) using image analysis. A total of 275% more new bone was present in defects grafted with Buguzhi extract in collagen matrix than those grafted with collagen matrix. No bone was formed in the negative control group. The amount of bone cells was also significantly greater in the Buguzhi group than in the positive control group. To conclude, Buguzhi extract in collagen matrix has the effect of increasing new bone formation locally in vivo. Buguzhi extract in collagen matrix can be used as a bone graft material.


[Effect of initial periodontal therapy on chronic periodontitis patients with stable coronary heart disease].

Maintenance of change in the Active-for-Life initiative. There is a notable gap in translating efficacious interventions to community-based organizations. Further, physical activity interventions have been less successful in promoting longer-term maintenance. This study examined 6-month maintenance of improvements seen in Active for Life (AFL), a translational research initiative. Participants from seven of 12 AFL sites enrolled in Years 3 and 4 were surveyed 6 months after completing the 6-month telephone-based Active Choices program (AC, one site) or the 20-week or 12-week group-based Active Living Every Day program (ALED, six sites). Repeated measures analyses controlled for site clustering and covariates. Programs were implemented from 2003 to 2007 and analysis was conducted in 2009. For the AC (n=368) and ALED (n=2151) programs, respectively, participants were aged 72.0 and 70.8 years on average, were 70% and 78% non-Hispanic white, and were 72% and 83% women; 46% and 50% returned 6-month follow-up surveys. For AC, improvements from pre- to post-test were maintained at follow-up for physical activity; satisfaction with body function (SBF); and BMI. For ALED Year 3, there was a decrease at follow-up for physical activity and SBF. Body mass index decreased from pretest to follow-up. For ALED Year 4, increases in physical activity and reductions in BMI were maintained at follow-up. Satisfaction with body function increased from pretest to 12 weeks post-test, declined at 20 weeks, and was maintained at follow-up. Improvements were generally maintained at the 6-month follow-up. When behavioral decay occurred, follow-up values remained more favorable than at pretest. Given the broad reach of this translational initiative, the results suggest the viability of evidence-based programming as an effective public health practice.

Morphometric analysis and clinical application of the working dimensions of cricothyroid membrane in south Indian adults: with special relevance to surgical cricothyroidotomy. To measure the working dimensions of the cricothyroid membrane in the adult south Indian population and to establish the association between the working dimensions and the appropriate endotracheal tube size for the purpose of cricothyroidotomy. Cross-sectional evaluation of 50 fresh adult autopsy cases (35 men, 15 women) in a medical university teaching hospital in South India. Age ranged from 17.0 to 83.0 years. Working dimensions of the membrane in neutral position of neck, in men: width = 8.41 +/- 2.11 mm, height = 6.57 +/- 1.87 mm; in women: width = 6.30 +/- 1.29 mm, height = 5.80 +/- 1.56 mm. Depth of the subglottic larynx at the level of cricoid cartilage: men = 20.73 +/- 1.97 mm, women = 15.62 +/- 1.71 mm. Distance of the lower border of cricothyroid membrane from suprasternal notch in neutral position of neck, in men = 5.18 +/- 1.76 cm, women = 4.72 +/- 1.55 cm; in passively extended neck, men = 7.86 +/- 1.25 cm, women = 8.05 +/- 1.28 cm. Regression equations have been derived to determine endotracheal tube size for cricothyroidotomy, based on distance between sternal notch and chin, and height of the individual (P < 0.05). Working dimensions are smaller in the Indian group compared with western publications. Endotracheal tubes ranging from size 3.0 to 6.0 might be used for cricothyroidotomy in the adult south Indian population.


Mild to moderate liver dysfunction does not require dose reduction of oral or intravenous vinorelbine: results of a pharmacokinetic study.

Combining rational metabolic engineering and flux optimization strategies for efficient production of fumaric acid. Fumaric acid is an important C4-dicarboxylic acid widely used in chemical, food, and pharmaceutical industries. Rational metabolic engineering together with flux optimization were performed for the development of an Escherichia coli strain capable of efficiently producing fumaric acid. The initial engineered strain, CWF4N overexpressing phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PPC), produced 5.30 g/L of fumaric acid. Optimization of PPC flux by examining 24 types of synthetic PPC expression vectors further increased the titer up to 5.72 g/L with a yield of 0.432 g/gÂ·glucose. Overexpression of the succinate dehydrogenase complex (sdhCDAB) led to an increase in carbon yield up to 0.493 g/gÂ·glucose. Based on this mutant strain, citrate synthase (CS) was combinatorially overexpressed and balanced with PPC using 48 types of synthetic expression vectors. As a result, 6.24 g/L of fumaric acid was produced with a yield of 0.500 g/gÂ·glucose. Fed-batch culture of this final strain allowed production of 25.5 g/L of fumaric acid with a yield of 0.366 g/gÂ·glucose. Deletion of the aspA gene encoding aspartase and supplementation of aspartic acid further increased the fumaric acid titer to 35.1 g/L with a yield of 0.490 g/gÂ·glucose.

Is ethnicity a risk factor for severe retinopathy of prematurity? To assess the risk of severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) requiring treatment in different ethnic groups. Retrospective observational study on ROP screening and treatment. It involved a cross-sectional review of all eligible infants over a seven-year period. Statistical tests used were the Kruskal-Wallis test and Mann-Whitney U test. Logistic regression was used to control for any differences in birth weight and gestational age. City Hospital and Birmingham Women's Hospital, Birmingham, UK. 1690 preterm infants underwent ROP screening. Birth weight was lower in black (1142.5 g) and Asian infants (1180 g) when compared to white infants (1196.5 g). Gestational age was lower in black infants (28.5 weeks) compared to Asian and white infants (both 29 weeks). Compared to white infants, the odds of severe ROP requiring treatment was higher in Asian infants (odds ratio (OR): 2.52; 95% CI 1.41 to 4.50) and black infants (OR: 2.51; 95% CI 1.30 to 4.86). The additional risk from ethnicity was present even after adjusting for birth weight and gestational age (adjusted OR for Asian vs white infants: 2.45; 95% CI 1.334 to 4.497); (adjusted OR for black vs white infants: 2.0; 95% CI 1.004 to 4.014). Ethnicity is a risk factor for severe ROP. Asian and black infants have a higher risk of developing threshold ROP compared to white infants.

[Efficacy of surgical resection of left and right transthoracic approaches for middle thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma]. For squamous cell carcinoma of the middle thoracic esophagus, surgical resection of left or right transthoracic approach has its advantages and disadvantages, respectively. This study was to compare the outcomes between the two approaches. A total of 482 consecutive patients with middle thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) underwent transthoracic esophagectomy between January 1999 and June 2005. These patients were divided into left transthoracic approach group (n=350) and right transthoracic approach group (n=132). Surgical resection rate, postoperative complications, lymphadenectomy, recurrence pattern, disease-free survival, and overall survival of the two groups were compared retrospectively. The surgical resection rate was 92.0% in left approach group and 92.4% in right approach group (P=0.878). The incidence of postoperative complications was higher in right approach group than in left approach group (57.6% vs. 35.4%, P<0.001). The average number of lymph nodes resected was 11.8+/-6.6 in left approach group and 16.3+/-8.0 in right approach group (P<0.001). Lymphatic recurrence rate was lower in right approach group than in left approach group (51.1% vs. 69.6%,P=0.028), especially occurring to mediastinal lymph nodes (15.6% vs. 38.4%,P=0.005). Three-year disease-free survival was higher in right approach group than in left approach group(22.92+/-0.74 vs. 25.09+/-1.22, P=0.039). Although left transthoracic resection reduced the incidence of postoperative complications, esophagectomy of right transthoracic approach was more effective in survival improvement.

Hypothermia during ischemia protects against neuronal death but not acute brain edema following transient forebrain ischemia in mice. C57BL/6J mice are widely used as a background strain for genetic alterations and have been valuable for investigating the molecular mechanism of selective neuronal death following transient forebrain ischemia, which was induced by occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (BCCA). Hypothermia (HT) during ischemia has been shown to protect against neuronal death in several experimental models of cerebral ischemia including that induced by BCCA occlusion in C57BL/6J mice. In this study, we demonstrated that brain edema, one of the most important disorders following cerebral ischemia, occurred in the forebrain before neuronal death in the hippocampus and was not prevented by HT during cerebral ischemia induced by BCCA occlusion in C57BL/6J mice. Our results indicate that neuronal death and acute brain edema were induced by different mechanisms in the BCCA occlusion and reperfusion C57BL/6J mouse model, suggesting that our model with and without HT during cerebral ischemia may be a useful tool for the investigation of the specific mechanism of brain edema and neuronal death, respectively.


Characterisation of G8 human rotaviruses in Australian children with gastroenteritis.

Increased Dietary Intake of Saturated Fatty Acid Heptadecanoic Acid (C17:0) Associated with Decreasing Ferritin and Alleviated Metabolic Syndrome in Dolphins. Similar to humans, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) can develop metabolic syndrome and associated high ferritin. While fish and fish-based fatty acids may protect against metabolic syndrome in humans, findings have been inconsistent. To assess potential protective factors against metabolic syndrome related to fish diets, fatty acids were compared between two dolphin populations with higher (n = 30, Group A) and lower (n = 19, Group B) mean insulin (11 Â± 12 and 2 Â± 5 Î¼IU/ml, respectively; P < 0.0001) and their dietary fish. In addition to higher insulin, triglycerides, and ferritin, Group A had lower percent serum heptadecanoic acid (C17:0) compared to Group B (0.3 Â± 0.1 and 1.3 Â± 0.4%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Using multivariate stepwise regression, higher percent serum C17:0, a saturated fat found in dairy fat, rye, and some fish, was an independent predictor of lower insulin in dolphins. Capelin, a common dietary fish for Group A, had no detectable C17:0, while pinfish and mullet, common in Group B's diet, had C17:0 (41 and 67 mg/100g, respectively). When a modified diet adding 25% pinfish and/or mullet was fed to six Group A dolphins over 24 weeks (increasing the average daily dietary C17:0 intake from 400 to 1700 mg), C17:0 serum levels increased, high ferritin decreased, and blood-based metabolic syndrome indices normalized toward reference levels. These effects were not found in four reference dolphins. Further, higher total serum C17:0 was an independent and linear predictor of lower ferritin in dolphins in Group B dolphins. Among off the shelf dairy products tested, butter had the highest C17:0 (423mg/100g); nonfat dairy products had no detectable C17:0. We hypothesize that humans' movement away from diets with potentially beneficial saturated fatty acid C17:0, including whole fat dairy products, could be a contributor to widespread low C17:0 levels, higher ferritin, and metabolic syndrome. 

[Genetic conditioned changes in activity of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) and recurrent miscarriages]. 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is the key enzyme in folate, methionine and homocysteine metabolism. The disturbances in MTHFR activity could be the cause of increased serum level of homocysteine. Hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor of changes in coagulation cascade through direct cytotoxic influence on endothelium, atherogenesis, activation of coagulation factor V and VII, increased level of thrombin and platelets aggregation. Genetic disturbances in MTHFR enzyme activity in the presence of polymorphic variants of its gene are responsible for homocysteine augmentation and could be the reason of several gestational complications such as recurrent miscarriages.

The vascular effects of trace amines and amphetamines. Trace amines, including tyramine, beta-phenylethylamine (beta-PEA), tryptamine and octopamine, are biologically active amines mostly based on phenylethylamine, occurring in the body in trace amounts. They are a diverse group of naturally occurring and synthetic amines, which are also found in the diet and in herbal plants, such as ephedrine and cathinone. They include amphetamine and its analogues, such as MDMA ('ecstasy'), and synthetic proprietary sympathomimetic agents such as phenylpropanolamine and pseudoephedrine. On the vascular system they cause vasoconstriction and a rise in blood pressure. This effect is the basis of their use as nasal decongestants. For over 50 years, they have been assumed to be indirectly acting sympathomimetic amines, their responses being due to the release of noradrenaline from sympathetic neurones. There are, however, results that suggest that this is not their only mechanism of action and that they may also exert direct vascular effects independent of a noradrenergic mechanism. Recently, a group of novel trace amine-associated receptors (TAARs) have been cloned and identified in the brain and peripheral tissues including blood vessels. Trace amines bind to these cloned receptors and it is suggested that their vasoconstrictor effects can in part be attributed to this mechanism. This review describes the cardiovascular pharmacology of this diverse group of amines, their structures and uses and their endogenous synthesis and metabolism. The review also considers their clinical relevance as constituents of the diet, as therapeutic agents (ritodrine, phenylpropanolamine, and pseudoephedrine) and as drugs of abuse (amphetamine, 'ecstasy') and their mechanisms of action.

Primary and secondary prevention of atrial fibrillation with statins and polyunsaturated fatty acids: review of evidence and clinical relevance.


The uleine-rich fraction of Himatanthus lancifolius blocks proliferative responses of human lymphoid cells.

Vernakalant hydrochloride for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia encountered in clinical practice. Rhythm control strategy for AF is limited by drug toxicity and side effects, and recent trials have shown that this strategy is not superior to a rate control one. New antiarrhythmic drugs, free of undesired effects, would enhance rhythm control, with the possibility of sinus rhythm restoration and maintenance. A promising find in the search for new antiarrhythmic therapies is atrial-tissue specific ion channels. The findings that the ultrarapid delayed rectifier (I(Kur)) and the inwardly rectifying, acetylcholine-regulated current (I(K-Ach)) exist in atrial but not ventricular tissue increase the probability that atrioselective drugs without ventricular proarrhythmic toxicity can be developed for treatment of patients with AF. There are also other potential targets for atrial-selective therapy: transient outward current (I(to)), rapidly and slowly activating delayed rectifier currents (I(Kr) and I(Ks)), atrial sodium current (I(Na)) and atrially expressed connexins. New drugs under development with promising atrial-selectivity include: tertiapin, NIP-142, NIP-141, JTV-519, AVE0118, AVE1231, DPO-1, AZD7009 and many others. Among such new agents, vernakalant hydrochloride is currently in an advanced phase of development and has already been evaluated in clinical trials. In this overview, we describe the history and current state of developmental process of the drug, as well as its mechanism of action and influence on electrophysiological parameters. Vernakalant seems to be effective in terminating recent-onset AF, but is not efficacious in long-lasting AF and atrial flutter. The drug may be relatively free of proarrhythmic effects, and exerts a protective effect on ventricular tissue and ventricular repolarization. It is expected that the intravenous formulation will soon be approved for the pharmacological termination of recent-onset AF.

The effect of DNA mismatch repair (MMR) status on oxaliplatin-based first-line chemotherapy as in recurrent or metastatic colon cancer. Colon cancer with DNA mismatch repair (MMR) defects reveals distinct clinical and pathologic features, including a better prognosis but reduced response to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based chemotherapy. A current standard treatment for recurrent or metastatic colon cancer uses capecitabine plus oxaliplatin (CAPOX), or continuous-infusion fluorouracil plus oxaliplatin (FOLFOX). This study investigated the effect of MMR status on the treatment outcomes for CAPOX and FOLFOX as first-line combination chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic colon cancer. We analyzed 171 patients who had been treated with CAPOX or FOLFOX as first-line combination chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic colon adenocarcinoma between February 2004 and July 2008. Tumor expression of the MMR proteins, MLH1 and MSH2, was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in surgically resected tumor specimens. The microsatellite instability (MSI) was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, using fluorescent dye-labeled primers specific to microsatellite loci. Tumors with MMR defect were defined as those demonstrating a loss of MMR protein expression (MMR-D) and/or a microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) genotype. In all, 75 patients (44%) received FOLFOX, and 96 patients (56%) received CAPOX as first-line combination chemotherapy. The incidence of colon cancer with MMR defect was 10/171 (6%). Colon cancers with MMR defect (MSI-H and/or MMR-D) are more commonly located in proximal to the splenic flexure (p=0.03). The MMR status did not significantly influence the overall response (p=0.95) to first-line CAPOX or FOLFOX treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic colon cancer. According to the MMR status, there was no significant difference for PFS (p=0.50) and OS (p=0.47) in patients with recurrent or metastatic colon cancer treated with first-line CAPOX or FOLFOX. In colon cancers with MMR defect, there was no significant difference for PFS (p=0.48) and OS (p=0.56) between CAPOX and FOLFOX as first-line combination chemotherapy. However, in MMR intact, there was significant difference for OS between CAPOX and FOLFOX (p=0.04). OS was significantly better in patients treated with CAPOX when compared to patients with FOLFOX. The MMR status does not predict the effect of oxaliplatin-based combination chemotherapy as 1st line in recurrent or metastatic colon cancers. CAPOX in the first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic colon cancer with MMR intacts showed a superior OS compared with FOLFOX unlike colon cancer with MMR defects.

Herpes simplex virus VP16, but not ICP0, is required to reduce histone occupancy and enhance histone acetylation on viral genomes in U2OS osteosarcoma cells. The herpes simplex virus (HSV) genome rapidly becomes associated with histones after injection into the host cell nucleus. The viral proteins ICP0 and VP16 are required for efficient viral gene expression and have been implicated in reducing the levels of underacetylated histones on the viral genome, raising the possibility that high levels of underacetylated histones inhibit viral gene expression. The U2OS osteosarcoma cell line is permissive for replication of ICP0 and VP16 mutants and appears to lack an innate antiviral repression mechanism present in other cell types. We therefore used chromatin immunoprecipitation to determine whether U2OS cells are competent to load histones onto HSV DNA and, if so, whether ICP0 and/or VP16 are required to reduce histone occupancy and enhance acetylation in this cell type. High levels of underacetylated histone H3 accumulated at several locations on the viral genome in the absence of VP16 activation function; in contrast, an ICP0 mutant displayed markedly reduced histone levels and enhanced acetylation, similar to wild-type HSV. These results demonstrate that U2OS cells are competent to load underacetylated histones onto HSV DNA and uncover an unexpected role for VP16 in modulating chromatin structure at viral early and late loci. One interpretation of these findings is that ICP0 and VP16 affect viral chromatin structure through separate pathways, and the pathway targeted by ICP0 is defective in U2OS cells. We also show that HSV infection results in decreased histone levels on some actively transcribed genes within the cellular genome, demonstrating that viral infection alters cellular chromatin structure.

Divergence and gene flow among Darwin's finches: A genome-wide view of adaptive radiation driven by interspecies allele sharing. A recent analysis of the genomes of Darwin's finches revealed extensive interspecies allele sharing throughout the history of the radiation and identified a key locus responsible for morphological evolution in this group. The radiation of Darwin's finches on the GalÃ¡pagos archipelago has long been regarded as an iconic study system for field ecology and evolutionary biology. Coupled with an extensive history of field work, these latest findings affirm the increasing acceptance of introgressive hybridization, or gene flow between species, as a significant contributor to adaptive evolution. Here, we review and discuss these findings in relation to both classical work on Darwin's finches and contemporary work showing similar evolutionary signatures in other biological systems. The continued unification of genomic data with field biology promises to further elucidate the molecular basis of adaptation in Darwin's finches and well beyond.

On the analysis of genome-wide association studies in family-based designs: a universal, robust analysis approach and an application to four genome-wide association studies. For genome-wide association studies in family-based designs, we propose a new, universally applicable approach. The new test statistic exploits all available information about the association, while, by virtue of its design, it maintains the same robustness against population admixture as traditional family-based approaches that are based exclusively on the within-family information. The approach is suitable for the analysis of almost any trait type, e.g. binary, continuous, time-to-onset, multivariate, etc., and combinations of those. We use simulation studies to verify all theoretically derived properties of the approach, estimate its power, and compare it with other standard approaches. We illustrate the practical implications of the new analysis method by an application to a lung-function phenotype, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) in 4 genome-wide association studies.

[Evaluation of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in mouse by molecular imaging of P-selectin with targeted contrast echocardiography]. To assess the feasibility of evaluating myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in mouse with targeted myocardial contrast echocardiography (MCE). Phospholipid microbubbles targeted to P-selectin (MBp) and control microbubbles (MBc) were created by conjugating monoclonal antibody against murine P-selectin or isotype control antibody with the lipid shell via "avidin-biotin" bridging. Ten mice with myocardial ischemia-reperfusion were injected intravenously of MBp and MBc in a random order with a 30 min interval. After 5 min of intravenous injection of microbubble, targeted MCE imaging was performed in all mice. And then the video intensity (VI) was determined. A significant ultrasonic enhancement was observed in ischemic region of MBp-group. Increment in VI value of ischemic region in MBp-group was great and it amounted to (26.0 +/- 6.2) U. However, increment in VI value of ischemic region in MBc-group was minor and it was merely (9.1 +/- 0.9) U. Difference was evident in ischemic region between of two groups (P < 0.05). In both MBp-group and MBc-group, the VI value of ischemic region was significantly greater than that of non-ischemic region (6.5 +/- 1.0) U vs (6.4 +/- 0.8) U (P < 0.05). There was no obvious difference in the VI of non-ischemic region between two groups. Molecular imaging of P-selectin with targeted contrast echocardiography can effectively evaluate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.


Temporal and regional variations in the use of preoperative radiation therapy for rectal cancer.

Cell signaling in space and time: where proteins come together and when they're apart. Signal transduction can be defined as the coordinated relay of messages derived from extracellular cues to intracellular effectors. More simply put, information received on the cell surface is processed across the plasma membrane and transmitted to intracellular targets. This requires that the activators, effectors, enzymes, and substrates that respond to cellular signals come together when they need to.

Hypoxia-induced des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin production in hepatocellular carcinoma. Des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) is an established HCC tumor marker, but the precise mechanism of its production is still unclear. Recently, we demonstrated that cytoskeletal changes during epithelial-to-fibroblastoid conversion (EFC) or epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) induced by chemicals plays a critical mechanistic role in DCP production via impairment in vitamin K uptake. Our proposed mechanism of DCP production is consistent with substantial clinical evidence. Supplementary vitamin K2 analogues reduced serum DCP levels in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. HCC patients with high serum DCP are associated with vascular invasion, metastasis and tumor recurrence. On the other hand, hypoxia has been reported to induce EMT or cytoskeletal changes. Therefore, we examined whether hypoxia induced DCP production during EFC or EMT in HCC cells. Indeed, hypoxic stimulation induced hepatoma cell lines (HepG2 or PLC/PRF/5 cells) to undergo EFC or EMT and these cells produced DCP. Immunofluorescence study demonstrated that hypoxic stimulation impaired labeled low-density lipoprotein uptake, which was a surrogate for vitamin K uptake. In addition, fine filamentous actin network, which has crucial role for clathrin-mediated endocytosis of vitamin K, was disrupted in DCP producing cells by hypoxic stimulation. Thus, hypoxic stimulation induced HCC cells to produce DCP in the same mechanism as chemicals. Furthermore, immunohistochemical study using surgically resected HCC samples showed that a positive staining of nuclear hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha was more frequently observed in HCC cells with stronger staining intensity of DCP. Importantly, clinical observations that DCP as an HCC tumor marker was more useful in larger tumors, which is likely to be exposed with hypoxia during tumor development, support our results.

Hodgkin lymphoma across the age spectrum: epidemiology, therapy, and late effects. The treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma is one of the success stories of modern medicine. There is a unified pathologic classification schema, a noninvasive staging evaluation and an increasingly sophisticated approach to therapy with risk and response adapted therapies in pediatric and adult patient populations. Survival rates have continued to improve while treatment modifications to decrease late effects are studied across all populations. However, a strong age gradient exists with respect to patient outcomes with younger patients faring somewhat better than their adult counterparts and older adults faring significantly worse. There has been a growing appreciation for the differences in epidemiology across age groups and the potential differences in disease biology. Novel approaches to prognostic stratification and therapy on the basis of these differences may be necessary to maximize cure and minimize late effects across the ages.

Clinical outcomes of drug-eluting versus bare-metal in-stent restenosis. In-stent restenosis (ISR) is a challenging syndrome that affects drug-eluting stents and bare-metal stents. However, data comparing the outcomes of drug-eluting versus bare-metal ISR are limited. Our objective was to evaluate the long-term clinical outcomes of drug-eluting versus bare-metal ISR. Patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention at Cleveland Clinic for ISR from 05/1999 to 06/2007 were included. Unadjusted outcomes were tested using Kaplan-Meier curves followed by multivariable adjusted Cox proportional hazards analyses. Twenty seven variables, including type of stent used to treat ISR and procedural date, were included. The primary end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction (MI), or target lesion revascularization (TLR). The secondary endpoints were components of the primary endpoint. Of 931 patients identified, 225 had drug-eluting ISR and 706 had bare-metal ISR. There were 279 cumulative events for a median follow-up of 3.2 years. The primary endpoint was not different between drug eluting and bare-metal ISR (22% versus 33%, adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79-1.66; P = 0.49). The secondary endpoints of death (8% versus 16%, adjusted HR 1.05; 95% CI, 0.56-1.98; P = 0.88), MI (4% versus 5%, adjusted HR 1.48; 95% CI, 0.54-4.04; P = 0.45), and TLR (15% versus 16%, adjusted HR 1.30; 95% CI, 0.81-2.11; P = 0.28) were also not different. This study represents the largest analysis comparing drug-eluting to bare-metal ISR. On multivariable Cox proportional hazard analyses, drug-eluting and bare-metal ISR have similar long term outcomes.

An outbreak of neurological autoimmunity with polyradiculoneuropathy in workers exposed to aerosolised porcine neural tissue: a descriptive study. Between November, 2006, and May, 2008, a subacute neurological syndrome affected workers from two swine abattoirs in Minnesota and Indiana who had occupational exposure to aerosolised porcine brain. We aimed to describe the pathogenic and immunological characteristics of this illness. All patients from two abattoirs who presented or were referred to the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN, USA) with neurological symptoms were included. We recorded details of exposure to aerosolised brain tissue and did comprehensive neurological, laboratory, neuroimaging, electrophysiological, pathological, and autoimmune serological assessments. Healthy controls were recruited from the community and from workers at the plant in Minnesota. 24 patients were identified (21 from Minnesota, three from Indiana). The shortest duration from first exposure to symptom onset was 4 weeks. No infectious agent that could trigger disease was identified. All patients developed polyradiculoneuropathy, which was usually sensory predominant and painful. Two patients had initial CNS manifestations: transverse myelitis and meningoencephalitis. Nerve conduction studies localised abnormalities to the most proximal and distal nerve segments. Quantitative sensory and autonomic testing revealed involvement of large and small sensory fibres and sweat fibres. MRI showed prominent abnormalities of roots and ganglia. Nerve biopsies identified mild demyelination, axonal degeneration, and perivascular inflammation. Protein concentrations were high in the CSF of 18 (86%) of 21 patients. Sera from all patients and 29 (34%) of 85 unaffected workplace controls (but none of 178 community controls) had a distinctive neural-reactive IgG; 75% of patients' sera contained an IgG specific to myelin basic protein. Seropositivity correlated directly with exposure risk in patients and controls. 17 patients required immunomodulatory therapies, six improved spontaneously, and one was lost to follow-up after exposure stopped. The neurological disorder described is autoimmune in origin and is related to occupational exposure to multiple aerosolised porcine brain tissue antigens. The pattern of nerve involvement suggests vulnerability of nerve roots and terminals where the blood-nerve barrier is most permeable.

Neural "ignition": enhanced activation linked to perceptual awareness in human ventral stream visual cortex.

Phase II evaluation of eribulin mesylate (E7389, NSC 707389) in patients with metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: Southwest Oncology Group trial S0618. Eribulin mesylate, an halichondrin B analog, binds to tubulin and microtubules and possesses broad anti-cancer activity. We conducted a multi-institutional Phase II trial to evaluate the response rate of eribulin mesylate in patients with metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN). Forty eligible patients who had not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic or recurrent SCCHN were enrolled with the following characteristics: 29 male, 11 female; median age 61.2 years; Zubrod Performance Status of 0 (48%) and 1 (53%). Thirty-three patients (83%) had metastatic disease. Primary tumor sites included: 38% oropharynx, 30% lip/oral cavity, 15% larynx, 10% hypopharynx, 5% other/unknown and 3% nasopharynx. Patients received eribulin mesylate at 1.4 mg/mÂ² on Days 1 and 8 of an every 21-day cycle. Common Grade 3 and 4 toxicities included: lymphopenia (15%), leukocytopenia (13%), neutropenia (10%), hyponatremia (5%), fatigue (5%), diarrhea (5%) and dyspnea (5%), with one treatment-related death due to pulmonary hemorrhage. Among 40 assessable patients, two confirmed partial responses were observed, for an estimated confirmed response rate of 5% (95% confidence interval: 1-17%). The estimated median progression-free survival is 3 months (95% confidence interval: 1-3 months) and estimated median overall survival is 7 months (95% confidence interval: 5-10 months). Eribulin mesylate given on Days 1 and 8 of a twenty-one day cycle in metastatic or recurrent SCCHN was well tolerated, but did not result in a clinically significant median PFS. Studies of other agents should be considered in this setting.


The role of bone marrow edema and lymphangiogenesis in inflammatory-erosive arthritis.

Lead and cadmium accumulation in medicinal plants collected from environmentally different sites. Though use of herbal medicine is increasing dramatically worldwide, environmental pollution especially with heavy metals poses serious problem on quality of medicinal plants and their products. In Ethiopia, where more than 85% of the population relies on traditional medicine, data on heavy metals level of plants is unavailable. The purpose of this study was to assess Pb and Cd in plants grown in different parts of Ethiopia. Out of 26 samples analyzed, four for lead (15.4%; 11.56 +/- 1.07 to 98.19 +/- 1.05 mg/kg) and seventeen for cadmium (65.4%; 0.38 to 1.83 +/- 0.06 mg/kg) were found to contain concentrations above WHO limits (10 mg/kg and 0.3 mg/kg respectively).

p53-dependent senescence delays Emu-myc-induced B-cell lymphomagenesis. The effect of p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest and senescence on Emu-myc-induced B-cell lymphoma development remains controversial. To address this question, we crossed Emu-myc mice with the p53(515C) mutant mouse, encoding the mutant p53R172P protein that retains the ability to activate the cell-cycle inhibitor and senescence activator p21. Importantly, this mutant lacks the ability to activate p53-dependent apoptotic genes. Hence, Emu-myc mice that harbor two p53(515C) alleles are completely defective for p53-dependent apoptosis. Both Emu-myc::p53(515C/515C) and Emu-myc::p53(515C/+) mice survive significantly longer than Emu-myc::p53(+/-) mice, indicating the importance of the p53-dependent non-apoptotic pathways in B-cell lymphomagenesis. In addition, the p53(515C) allele is deleted in several Emu-myc::p53(515C/+) lymphomas, further emphasizing the functionality of p53R172P in tumor inhibition. Lymphomas from both Emu-myc::p53(515C/515C) and Emu-myc::p53(515C/+) mice retain the ability to upregulate p21, resulting in cellular senescence. Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA beta-gal) activity was observed in lymphomas from Emu-myc::p53(+/+), Emu-myc::p53(515C/515C) and Emu-myc::p53(515C /+) mice but not in lymphomas isolated from Emu-myc::p53(+/-) mice. Thus, in the absence of p53-dependent apoptosis, the ability of p53R172P to induce senescence leads to a significant delay in B-cell lymphoma development.

Oxime derivatives related to AP18: Agonists and antagonists of the TRPA1 receptor. AP18 1 was recently disclosed as an antagonist of the TRPA1 receptor by the research group of Patapoutian. However, no detailed structure-activity relationships around 1 have been disclosed. Thus, a small number of oximes related to AP18 were examined in order to characterize the determinants of TRPA1 activity. Congeners of AP18 were found to possess both agonist and antagonist activity, suggesting that AP18 may behave as a covalent antagonist of the TRPA1 ion-channel.

Expression and role of adiponectin receptor 1 in  lipopolysaccharide-induced proliferation of cultured rat  adventitial fibroblasts. Adiponectin is an adipose-derived hormone that has anti-diabetic and anti-atherogenic effects through interaction with AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 (adiponectin receptors 1 and 2), but little is known about the expression and function of adiponectin and its receptors in adventitia and adventitial fibroblasts. In the present study, we have demonstrated that AdipoR1 is highly expressed in rat adventitia and cultured adventitial fibroblasts by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescent staining, whereas Adipo2 is low-expressed. The expression of AdipoR1 have been observed to decrease gradually in adventitial fibroblasts in response to LPS (lipopolysaccharide) treatment. No local expression of adiponectin has been detected in adventitial tissues, indicating that serum adiponectin is the ligand for AdipoR1 in adventitial fibroblasts. In addition, treatment of recombinant adiponectin inhibited LPS-induced proliferation of adventitial fibroblasts via activation of the AMPK (adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase). AdipoR1 siRNA (small interfering RNA) transfection potently knocked down the receptor protein. The siRNA-AdipoR1 transfected cells and AMPK inhibitor compound C treated cells showed decreased phosphorylated level of AMPK as determined by Western blot analysis, and increased the proliferation of adventitial fibroblasts as determined by BrdU (5-bromo-29-deoxyuridine) staining. These results demonstrated that adiponectin stimulates the proliferation of adventitial fibroblasts via the AdipoR1 and AMPK signalling pathways.

Pathology of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) infected with Brucella ceti. Seventeen striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) displaying swimming disorders compatible with neurological syndromes were investigated for Brucella infection. Sixteen dolphins had meningoencephalomyelitis. Serum antibody against Brucella antigen was detected in all 14 animals tested and Brucella ceti was isolated from eight out of nine animals. Brucella antigen was detected in the brain by immunofluorescence, but not by immunohistochemical labelling. By contrast, Brucella antigen was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry in the trophoblast of animals with severe placentitis and in the mitral valve of animals with myocarditis. The microscopical lesions observed in the tissues of the infected dolphins were similar to those of chronic brucellosis in man. The severity of brucellosis in S. coeruleoalba indicates that this dolphin species is highly susceptible to infection by B. ceti.

Are pharmacogenomic biomarkers an effective tool to predict taxane toxicity and outcome in breast cancer patients? Literature review. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, characterized by various molecular phenotypes that correlate with different prognosis and response to treatments. Taxanes are some of the most active chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer; however, their utilization is limited, due to hematologic and cumulative neurotoxicity on treated patients. To understand why only some patients experience severe adverse effects and why patients respond and develop resistance with different rates to taxane therapy, the metabolic pathways of these drugs should be completely unraveled. The variant forms of several genes, related to taxane pharmacokinetics, can be indicative markers of clinical parameters, such as toxicity or outcome. The search of the data has been conducted through PubMed database, presenting clinical data, clinical trials and basic research restricted to English language until June 2015. We studied the literature in order to find any possible association between the major pharmacogenomic variants and specific taxane-related toxicity and patient outcome. We found that the data of these studies are sometimes discordant, due to both the small number of enrolled patients and the heterogeneity of the examined population. Among all analyzed genes, only CYP1B1 and ABCB1 resulted the strongest candidates to become biomarkers of clinical response to taxane therapy in breast cancer, although their utilization still remains an experimental procedure. In the future, greater studies on genetic polymorphisms should be performed in order to identify differentiating signatures for patients with higher toxicity and with resistant or responsive outcome, before the administration of taxanes.

Assessment of clinical efficacy of intranasal desmopressin spray and diclofenac sodium suppository in treatment of renal colic versus diclofenac sodium alone. To determine the effect of the combination of intranasal desmopressin spray and diclofenac sodium suppository on acute renal colic and compare it with diclofenac sodium suppository alone. A total of 150 patients aged 15-65 years referred to our hospital with acute renal colic were included in a double-blind controlled clinical trial study. Patients in group 1 received desmopressin, 40 microg intranasally plus diclofenac sodium suppository 100 mg, and patients in group 2 received diclofenac sodium suppository 100 mg plus a placebo spray consisting of normal saline 0.9%. Significant differences were found in the pain scores at 15 and 30 minutes between the 2 groups (P < .05). Also, significant differences were found in the mean pain scores in the first 15 and first 30 minutes after treatment between the 2 groups (P < .05). Of the patients in group 1, 37.3% had no pain relief and required pethidine. However, this rate in group 2 was 69.3%. In 17 cases, we prescribed pethidine within 20 minutes after treatment, and these patients were excluded from our study. According to our results, intranasal desmopressin plus diclofenac sodium suppository caused prompt pain relief with significant decreases in pain scores after 15 and 30 minutes. We suggest that intranasal desmopressin spray is a useful supplemental therapy for renal colic in combination with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, especially to reduce the use of opioids.

Climate and demography in early prehistory: using calibrated (14)C dates as population proxies. Although difficult to estimate for prehistoric hunter-gatherer populations, demographic variables-population size, density, and the connectedness of demes-are critical for a better understanding of the processes of material culture change, especially in deep prehistory. Demography is the middle-range link between climatic changes and both biological and cultural evolutionary trajectories of human populations. Much of human material culture functions as a buffer against climatic changes, and the study of prehistoric population dynamics, estimated through changing frequencies of calibrated radiocarbon dates, therefore affords insights into how effectively such buffers operated and when they failed. In reviewing a number of case studies (Mesolithic Ireland, the origin of the Bromme culture, and the earliest late glacial human recolonization of southern Scandinavia), I suggest that a greater awareness of demographic processes, and in particular of demographic declines, provides many fresh insights into what structured the archaeological record. I argue that we cannot sideline climatic and environmental factors or extreme geophysical events in our reconstructions of prehistoric culture change. The implications of accepting demographic variability as a departure point for evaluating the archaeological record are discussed.


Everolimus with very low-exposure cyclosporine a in de novo kidney transplantation: a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial.

Polymorphisms in genes of respiratory control and sudden infant death syndrome. Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is a multifactorial syndrome and assumingly, among other mechanisms, a deficit in respiratory control leads to a failure of arousal and autoresuscitation when the child is challenged by a stressful homeostatic event, e.g., hypoxia. We hypothesize that genetic polymorphisms involved in respiratory control mediated in the medulla oblongata contribute to SIDS. Therefore, a total of 366 SIDS cases and 421 controls were genotyped for 48 SNPs in 41 candidate genes. Genotyping was performed using Fluidigm nanofluidic technology. Results were obtained for 356 SIDS and 406 controls and 38 SNPs. After correction for multiple testing, one SNP retained a nominally significant association with seasonal SIDS: rs1801030 in the phenol sulfotransferase 1A1 gene (subgroup: death occurring during summer). A borderline association could be also observed for rs563649 in the opioid receptor Î¼1 gene in a recessive model (subgroup: death occurring during autumn). As a conclusion, although these data suggest two SNPs to be associated with different subgroups of SIDS cases, none of them can fully explain the SIDS condition, consistent with its multifactorial etiology. Given the great complexity of respiratory control and our initial findings reported here, we believe it is worthwhile to further investigate genes involved in the respiratory system. 


Complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) impairs visuospatial perception,whereas post-herpetic neuralgia does not: possible implications for supraspinal mechanism of CRPS.

Cardiac Autonomic Response to Active Standing in Adults With Vasovagal Syncope. Little is known about the autonomic response to active standing in vasovagal syncope, and most works have focused on children or adolescents. The aim of this work was to study the changes in cardiac autonomic modulation in adult patients with vasovagal syncope through heart rate variability analysis with linear and short-term complexity (alpha-1) indexes during supine position and active standing, in patients with positive or negative head-up tilt test (HUTT). Twenty-five patients with vasovagal syncope were included. Heart rate variability linear and short-term complexity (alpha-1) indexes were recorded during an active standing test (15 minutes in each position) and compared among patients grouped by HUTT outcome and between positions. During supine position, positive HUTT (+HUTT) patients had longer mean RR (1016 [850-1051] milliseconds), higher pNN50 (17.7 [9.2-26.2]), lower sympathovagal balance (1.3 [0.5-1.7]), and alpha-1 (0.9 [0.8-1.0]) than negative HUTT (-HUTT) patients (871 [776-969] milliseconds, 8.8 [2.1-14.5], 2.9 [1.3-3.9], and 1.2 [1.0-1.1], respectively). During active standing, heart rate and alpha-1 increased in both groups; in +HUTT patients, pNN50 decreased, whereas sympathovagal balance increased. The magnitude of change between positions of sympathovagal balance and alpha-1 was 6.1 and 4.8 times larger in +HUTT than -HUTT patients, respectively. The underlying cardiac autonomic mechanism in vasovagal syncope may involve different autonomic patterns in subjects with a history of recurrent syncope and +HUTT or -HUTT.


Alignment of phylogenetically unambiguous indels in Shewanella.

Pulmonary vascular remodeling correlates with lung eggs and cytokines in murine schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis is considered to be the most common worldwide cause of pulmonary hypertension. At present there is no well-characterized animal model to study the pathobiology of this important condition. To develop a mouse model of schistosomiasis, characterize the extent of pulmonary vascular remodeling, and determine the potential role of inflammatory cytokines. Mice (C57/Bl6) were infected transcutaneously with a high dose (approximately 75-100 cercariae) or a low dose (approximately 30 cercariae) of Schistosoma mansoni, and the development of lung and liver pathology was studied in the subacute (high-dose) and chronic (low-dose) settings. In the subacute setting, mice showed few eggs in the lungs and no evidence of pulmonary vascular remodeling. In contrast, chronically infected animals had a much greater lung egg burden and developed marked pulmonary vascular remodeling accompanied by perivascular inflammation from 12 weeks onwards. In addition, we observed the presence of plexiform-like lesions in these mice. Lung egg burden correlated with both liver egg burden and right ventricular (RV) index in the chronic group, although significant RV hypertrophy was lacking. Plasma Th1 and Th2 cytokines increased with time in the chronic group and correlated with the degree of pulmonary vascular remodeling. This study provides evidence for extensive pulmonary vascular remodeling, despite the absence of RV hypertrophy, in a mouse model of schistosomiasis, including the formation of plexiform-like lesions. Inflammatory cytokines and lung egg burden may contribute to vascular lesion formation.

[Genetic diversity of ixodid tick-borne pathogens in Tomsk City and suburbs]. We studied two urban and two suburban biotypes of Tomsk City for tick-transmitted diseases prevalence in naturally collected ticks. Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) was found in 6.5% of tick samples, West Nile virus (WNV) in 2.2%, Borrelia spp. in 8%, Rickettsia spp. in 2.5%, and Ehrlichia spp. in 1.7% of samples. Genetic markers of Powassan virus, Bartonella spp., and Balbesia spp. were not found. Analysis of the genetic diversity of revealed pathogens resulted in the following conclusions: 1. TBEV strains belong to Siberian and Far-Eastern subtypes, and Far-Eastern subtype of TBEV is most frequent in urban biotypes (up to 43 % of urban strains of TBEV); 2. WNV strains belong to genotype la; 3. Borrelia spp. were classified as B. garinii; 4. Rickettsia spp. were classified as R. tarasevichiae and probably as a new Rickettsia raoultii subspecies; 5. Ehrlichia spp. were classified as E. muris. The coexistence of several pathogens was found in 5.7% of tick samples, and the most frequent combination was TBEV + Borrelia spp.

Methodology for mapping non-forest wood elements using historic cadastral maps and aerial photographs as a basis for management. The objective of this study was to test a method for analysing long-term structural changes in non-forest wood elements, using a newly developed classification system and relevant landscape characteristics. Although these non-forest wood elements are biotopes that have positive effects for the ecological stability of the landscape little is known about their long-term dynamics. The newly developed knowledge of the historical impact of various landscape management practices on non-forest wood elements can be applied in landscape planning procedures (e.g. planning ecological networks) in order to ensure relevant landscape management in the future. The method was applied in two contrasting study sites, Honbice (244 ha) and Krida (268 ha), located in east Bohemia and north Bohemia, in the Czech Republic. The study was based on old cadastral maps (from 1839 to 1843), black and white aerial photographs (from 1938, 1950, 1966, 1975 to 2006) and field control data from 2006. At the Honbice study site, the proportion of non-forest wood elements increased from 2.0 to 2.9% of the study site, due to large plantations of scattered vegetation in the open landscape. On the other hand, more than half of the wood vegetation in the village was cut down between 1966 and 2006. In addition, the relative length of the tree alleys decreased from 0.021 km ha(-1) to 0.018 km ha(-1) between 1950 and 1966. At the Krida study site, there was a significant increase in non-forest vegetation (from 2.4 to 8.2%), due to abandonment of the landscape (former military area). As the village disappeared, the total amount of scattered vegetation grew, due to the natural succession process. The relative length of the tree alleys decreased from 0.009 km ha(-1) to 0.005 km ha(-1). The method that was applied and based on the analysis of long-term structural changes in non-forest wood elements, using a (newly developed) classification system and relevant landscape characteristics has proved to be a suitable procedure for making a detailed description of long-term structural changes in non-forest wood elements in the landscape. The detailed classification system can be used most efficiently when it is applied to rather small territories. Some characteristics display a similar ability to describe changes in non-forest wood structures (e.g. relative length, proportion of the category).

Application of electrophoton capture (EPC) analysis based on gas discharge visualization (GDV) technique in medicine: a systematic review. The objective of this study was to evaluate the scale and scope of implementing electrophoton capture (EPC) analysis based on gas discharge visualization (GDV) technique in diverse medical applications and psychophysiology; to identify the range of applications in medicine; and to show in which areas the procedure can be useful to health professionals. The design of the study is a systematic review. The database included articles published in peer-reviewed journals, proceedings of the international scientific congress "Science, Information, Spirit" (2003-2007), articles from the International Union of Medical and Applied Bioelectrography database, and proceedings of other conferences devoted to EPC or GDV, bioelectrography, and biophotonics. Search restrictions were human subjects, English or Russian language, and publication date from 2003 to 2007. All randomized controlled studies (RCTs) and systematic research reports (SRRs) were evaluated using Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network and Jadad checklists. The search yielded 136 articles addressing four different fields of medical and psychophysiologic applications of EPC (GDV). Among them were 26 SRR, 19 RCT, 18 case reports or case series, and 13 cohort studies. Thirteen (13) RCTs and 19 SRRs were rated "high" on the two conventional checklists. (1) The software and equipment EPC/GDV-complex is a convenient and easy-to-use device, easily allows examining patients with various pathologies and, therefore, offers a wide range of applications. (2) The GDV method has shown itself to be very fast (i.e., it is an "express-method" for studying states of the human organism). (3) Our review has revealed that GDV method can be implemented as an express method for assessment of treatment procedure effectiveness, evaluating emotional and physical conditions of people, and in many other fields.

Eye movement and diffusion tensor imaging analysis of treatment effects in a Niemann-Pick Type C patient. New treatment options for Niemann-Pick Type C (NPC) have recently become available. To assess the efficiency and efficacy of these new treatment markers for disease status and progression are needed. Both the diagnosis and the monitoring of disease progression are challenging and mostly rely on clinical impression and functional testing of horizontal eye movements. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) provides information about the microintegrity especially of white matter. We show here in a case report how DTI and measures derived from this imaging method can serve as adjunct quantitative markers for disease management in Niemann-Pick Type C. Two approaches are taken--first, we compare the fractional anisotropy (FA) in the white matter globally between a 29-year-old NPC patient and 18 healthy age-matched controls and show the remarkable difference in FA relatively early in the course of the disease. Second, a voxelwise comparison of FA values reveals where white matter integrity is compromised locally and demonstrate an individualized analysis of FA changes before and after 1year of treatment with Miglustat. This method might be useful in future treatment trials for NPC to assess treatment effects.


Precise Classification of Cervical Carcinomas Combined with Somatic Mutation Profiling Contributes to Predicting Disease Outcome.

Hepatitis C virus core protein induces apoptosis-like caspase independent cell death. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) associated liver diseases may be related to apoptotic processes. Thus, we investigated the role of different HCV proteins in apoptosis induction as well as their potency to interact with different apoptosis inducing agents. The use of a tightly adjustable tetracycline (Tet)-dependent HCV protein expression cell system with the founder osteosarcoma cell line U-2 OS allowed switch-off and on of the endogenous production of HCV proteins. Analyzed were cell lines expressing the HCV polyprotein, the core protein, protein complexes of the core, envelope proteins E1, E2 and p7, and non-structural proteins NS3 and NS4A, NS4B or NS5A and NS5B. Apoptosis was measured mainly by the detection of hypodiploid apoptotic nuclei in the absence or presence of mitomycin C, etoposide, TRAIL and an agonistic anti-CD95 antibody. To further characterize cell death induction, a variety of different methods like fluorescence microscopy, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-catalyzed deoxyuridinephosphate (dUTP)-nick end labeling) assay, Annexin V staining, Western blot and caspase activation assays were included into our analysis.Two cell lines expressing the core protein but not the total polyprotein exerted a strong apoptotic effect, while the other cell lines did not induce any or only a slight effect by measuring the hypodiploid nuclei. Cell death induction was caspase-independent since it could not be blocked by zVAD-fmk. Moreover, caspase activity was absent in Western blot analysis and fluorometric assays while typical apoptosis-associated morphological features like the membrane blebbing and nuclei condensation and fragmentation could be clearly observed by microscopy. None of the HCV proteins influenced the apoptotic effect mediated via the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway while only the core protein enhanced death-receptor-mediated apoptosis. Our data showed a caspase-independent apoptosis-like effect of the core protein, which seems to be inhibited in the presence of further HCV proteins like the non structural (NS) proteins. This observation could be of relevance for the viral spread since induction of an apoptosis-like cell death by the core protein may have some impact on the release of the HCV particles from the host cell.

Expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase in nasopharyngeal carcinoma impairs the cytolytic function of peripheral blood lymphocytes. Tumor-specific cytotoxic T cells and infiltrating lymphocytes are frequently found in tumor tissues in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Most patients with NPC, however, especially those with advanced stages, have a poor clinical prognosis despite conventional immunotherapy. The aim of this work was to examine the effect of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an immunosuppressive enzyme, on the lymphocyte function in NPC. The NPC cell line CNE2 was treated by interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) and the levels of IDO expression was analyzed by Western blotting and reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Lymphocytes from health human exposed to the milieu created by IDO-positive CNE2 cells and the lymphocyte cytotoxicity to target tumor cells was analyzed by standard lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assay. Additionally, expression of IDO was determined by Immunohistochemical assay in the tumor tissues form clinically evaluated NPC. IDO expression was acutely induced in the NPC cell line CNE2 by low dose interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) or by co-incubation with activated lymphocytes. Exposure to the milieu created by IDO-positive CNE2 cells did not promote lymphocyte death, but lymphocyte cytotoxicity against target tumor cells was impaired. The suppression of lymphocyte cytotoxic function was fully restored when the conditioned medium was replaced by fresh medium for 24 h. In additionally, the IDO-positive cells were found scattered in the tumor tissues from patients with NPC. Altogether, these findings suggest that IDO-mediated immunosuppression may be involved in the tumor immune evasion, and that blocking IDO activity in tumor cells may help to re-establish an effective anti-tumor T cell response in NPC.

[The prognosis value of B-type natriuretic peptide testing in critically ill non-cardiogenic patients]. B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP)have been used widely in the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiogenic diseases, but the association between BNP concentrations and non-cardiogenic critical illness is unknown. Our study aims at investigating the role of natriuretic peptide testing for predicting 28-day mortality of non-cardiogenic critically ill patients in emergency department (ED). A total of 255 non-cardiogenic critically ill patients treated in the emergency department were prospectively enrolled and a sample of blood was obtained for BNP measurement from each patient. A variety of clinical and laboratory variables were recorded. After 28 days, the vital status of each patient was ascertained and the association between BNP values at presentation and mortality was assessed. 71 patients died during the 28-day observation period. Median BNP concentrations at presentation among decedents were significantly higher than those of survivors (326.0 ng/L versus 50.9 ng/L, P < 0.001). The optimal BNP cut point for predicting 28-day mortality was 114.0 ng/L. In a multivariate analysis (Cox-regression), a BNP concentration greater than 114.0 ng/L (RR 7.268, 95% CI 3.864-13. 672) and an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE II) scores greater than 20 (RR 3.330, 95% CI 1.815-6.109) were the independent predictors of the 28-day mortality. BNP concentration alone had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.825 for predicting mortality. BNP concentrations at presentation are strong predictor of 28-day mortality in patients with non-cardiogenic critically ill patients in ED, which is better than Rapid Acute Physiology Score (RAPS) , Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS) and APACHE II score.

The development of the next generation of nurse leaders. This article explains the development of a value-added leadership focus to a graduate nursing program. With the changes to and complexity within the health care system, advanced practice nurses need academic preparation in advanced care management of populations and leadership competencies. Strategic environmental scanning suggested that some revisions could better prepare future nurse leaders. Through literature review and focus groups, faculty's analysis provided evidence for development of a different kind of advanced practice nurse. This process led to a graduate program that prepares nurse leaders who are competent in the clinical settings and leadership roles of today's health care organizations. The 40-semester hour program allows flexibility for minimum career disruption and a choice of tracks to accommodate individuals' educational needs. Grounded in practicum experiences and guided by health care theory, policy, and research, graduates possess the knowledge and competencies to assume the advanced leadership roles required in future health care systems.


Effectiveness of magnetic resonance imaging in detecting partial and complete distal biceps tendon rupture.

Runs of homozygosity and distribution of functional variants in the cattle genome. Recent developments in sequencing technology have facilitated widespread investigations of genomic variants, including continuous stretches of homozygous genomic regions. For cattle, a large proportion of these runs of homozygosity (ROH) are likely the result of inbreeding due to the accumulation of elite alleles from long-term selective breeding programs. In the present study, ROH were characterized in four cattle breeds with whole genome sequence data and the distribution of predicted functional variants was detected in ROH regions and across different ROH length classes. On average, 19.5% of the genome was located in ROH across four cattle breeds. There were an average of 715.5 ROH per genome with an average size of ~750 kbp, ranging from 10 (minimum size considered) to 49,290 kbp. There was a significant correlation between shared short ROH regions and regions putatively under selection (p < 0.001). By investigating the relationship between ROH and the predicted deleterious and non-deleterious variants, we gained insight into the distribution of functional variation in inbred (ROH) regions. Predicted deleterious variants were more enriched in ROH regions than predicted non-deleterious variants, which is consistent with observations in the human genome. We also found that increased enrichment of deleterious variants was significantly higher in short (<100 kbp) and medium (0.1 to 3 Mbp) ROH regions compared with long (>3 Mbp) ROH regions (P < 0.001), which is different than what has been observed in the human genome. This study illustrates the distribution of ROH and functional variants within ROH in cattle populations. These patterns are different from those in the human genome but consistent with the natural history of cattle populations, which is confirmed by the significant correlation between shared short ROH regions and regions putatively under selection. These findings contribute to understanding the effects of inbreeding and probably selection in shaping the distribution of functional variants in the cattle genome.

Mucopolysaccharidosis type-IS presenting with onset of carpal tunnel syndrome at adolescence. Mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) results from deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-L iduronidase. Three subtypes, based on severity of clinical findings, have been described, of which MPS type IS (also called Scheie syndrome) is the mildest form. A woman (age, 30 years) and her little brother (age, 21 years) presented to our clinic complaining of atrophy of the thenar muscles, numbness in both hands, and contractures in the finger joints. Electrophysiologic examination showed severe carpal tunnel syndrome for both patients. Findings of cardiac and ocular involvements and decreased level of alpha-L iduronidase confirmed the diagnosis of Scheie syndrome. Enzyme replacement therapy was initiated for the further prevention of musculoskeletal and other organ complications. Delayed diagnosis of MPS type-IS and the musculoskeletal findings are discussed in these 2 familial patients.

Tumor cell/endothelial cell tight contact upregulates endothelial adhesion molecule expression mediated by NFkappaB: differential role of the shear stress. Cancer metastasis is a multistep process involving cell-cell interactions, but little is known about the adhesive interactions and signaling events during extravasation of tumor cells (TCs). In this study, cell adhesion molecule (CAM) expression was investigated using an in vitro assay, in which TCs were seeded onto an endothelial cell (ECs) monolayer and cocultured during 5 h. Flow cytometry, confocal microscopy as well as western blot analysis indicated that endothelial ICAM-1 (Inter Cellular Adhesion Molecule-1), VCAM-1 (Vascular Adhesion Molecule-1) and E-selectin were up-regulated after TC-EC coculture, whereas no change was observed for CAMs expression in tumor cells. This increased CAMs expression required tight contact between TCs and ECs. Incubation of ECs with the pyrrolidine-dithiocarbamate NFkappaB inhibitor prior to coculture, fully prevented coculture-induced expression of endothelial CAMs. Using specific blocking antibodies we showed an implication of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 for TCs extravasation and VCAM-1 for adhesion. Moreover, fluid flow experiments revealed that high shear stress totally abolished coculture-induced as well as TNFalpha-induced CAMs over-expression. This study suggests that TCs could act as a potent inflammatory stimulus on ECs by inducing CAMs expression via NFkappaB activation, and that this action can be modulated by shear stress.

Prenatal diagnosis of congenital agenesis of the fetal portal venous system. To describe the prenatal diagnosis and review our experience of fetal congenital agenesis of the portal venous system (CAPVS) and to review the current literature on this poorly documented vascular malformation. This was a retrospective survey covering the 12-year period between 1996 and 2008. The database of a single, large, ultrasonographic tertiary academic referral center in Israel was analyzed and cases with a prenatal diagnosis of CAPVS were identified. All fetuses underwent detailed biometric and structural ultrasound examinations and a precise anatomical description of the fetal umbilical, portal and hepatic venous system was noted, as well as the presence of aberrant vessels, shunt location and the presence or absence of the DV. Results of fetal echocardiography, karyotyping and toxoplasma, rubella, cytomegalovirus and herpes evaluations were determined. Medical records were evaluated. Diagnosis was confirmed by pathology, postmortem venography or neonatal ultrasound or venography. Liveborns were examined by a certified neonatologist and long-term follow-up from pediatric gastroenterology units was determined. Nine cases with CAPVS were studied. In all cases an aberrant umbilical-portal vein was the primary indication for detailed portal system evaluation. Five fetuses demonstrated total CAPVS (Type I) and four showed partial agenesis of the portal vein (Type II). Among the five Type I fetuses, there was a shunt from the umbilical vein to the inferior vena cava in three (60%), to the right atrium in one and to the coronary sinus in one. In this group, in only one case could we delineate a common confluence between the splenic vein and the superior mesenteric vein shunting to the inferior vena cava. In four cases termination of pregnancy was performed due to additional findings: one case with hydrothorax, ascites and mitral atresia, one with cleft lip/palate and one with trisomy 21. One case had no additional anomalies, but the parents elected to terminate the pregnancy. All four of the Type II fetuses had a portosystemic shunt: in two cases to the right atrium, in one to the iliac vein and in one to the right hepatic vein. In three, the shunt resolved spontaneously. In only one case was abnormal liver function present over a follow-up period of 2-10 years. CAPVS can be detected prenatally. An abnormal course of the umbilical vein necessitates prompt sonographic evaluation of the umbilical-portal venous system and meticulous investigation for additional anomalies. Complete CAPVS may be associated with remote clinical consequences of which the parents should be informed. Partial CAPVS has a favorable prognosis.

A galaxy of folds. Many protein classification systems capture homologous relationships by grouping domains into families and superfamilies on the basis of sequence similarity. Superfamilies with similar 3D structures are further grouped into folds. In the absence of discernable sequence similarity, these structural similarities were long thought to have originated independently, by convergent evolution. However, the growth of databases and advances in sequence comparison methods have led to the discovery of many distant evolutionary relationships that transcend the boundaries of superfamilies and folds. To investigate the contributions of convergent versus divergent evolution in the origin of protein folds, we clustered representative domains of known structure by their sequence similarity, treating them as point masses in a virtual 2D space which attract or repel each other depending on their pairwise sequence similarities. As expected, families in the same superfamily form tight clusters. But often, superfamilies of the same fold are linked with each other, suggesting that the entire fold evolved from an ancient prototype. Strikingly, some links connect superfamilies with different folds. They arise from modular peptide fragments of between 20 and 40 residues that co-occur in the connected folds in disparate structural contexts. These may be descendants of an ancestral pool of peptide modules that evolved as cofactors in the RNA world and from which the first folded proteins arose by amplification and recombination. Our galaxy of folds summarizes, in a single image, most known and many yet undescribed homologous relationships between protein superfamilies, providing new insights into the evolution of protein domains.

Establishment of a Cell Line From Conjunctival Squamous Cell Carcinoma: PeCa-UkHb-01. Until now, no epithelial cell line from conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), to our knowledge, has existed; therefore, the establishment of a model cell line would be a useful tool for further studies. In particular, the phenotypic and molecular characterization in comparison to other SCC cells is of high interest because this would enable the development of new treatment options for clinical application in ophthalmic oncology. Epithelial cells were isolated from a bulbar conjunctiva SCC obtained from a 74-year-old male, harvested by stepwise trypsinization and named PeCa-UkHb-01. Cell doubling and the number of passages were determined. Short tandem repeats (STR) and karyotype analyses were performed. Semiquantitative real-time PCR and immunocytochemical fluorescence staining were carried out to detect tumor and epithelial cell markers. The cells had an epithelial and conjunctival phenotype. They grew above passage number 50 in a doubling time at approximately 34.5 hours. Short tandem repeat analyses confirmed the cell origin, although loss of heterozygosity occurred. Karyotype analyses revealed a heterogeneous composition of the cell culture and the karyogram itself showed aberrations and changes in the chromosome numbers. Real-time PCR and immunocytochemical fluorescence staining revealed the expression of the stem cell markers such as ABCG2, p63, OCT4, c-MYC, and SOX2 as well as the conjunctival cytokeratin K19. PeCa-UkHb-01 cells fulfill the criteria of a cell line. They display characteristics of ocular carcinoma cells and therefore the presented cell line might serve for further basic research in ophthalmic oncology.

Assessment of estrogenic activity and total lipids in maternal biological samples (serum and breast milk). The present study investigated estrogenic activity and total lipid levels in maternal serum and breast milk. The study was performed with 50 mothers from Fang district of northern Thailand. Maternal serum was collected 5 times, including the second trimester, pre-delivery period, delivery period, and lactating period at day 30 and day 60. Breast milk was collected 7 times, including day 1, 7, 14, 21, 30, 45, and 60 of lactation. There were the same patterns of variation between estrogenicity and total lipid levels both in serum and breast milk. The correlation between serum estrogenicity and serum total lipids was found with a correlation coefficient (r) ranging from 0.403 to 0.661. However, no correlation was found between milk estrogenicity and milk total lipids. The results therefore suggest that lipid contents might be the major factors affecting the variation of estrogenicity levels, and xenoestrogens, which the mother subjects exposed, were lipophilic pollutants. The remarkable findings were that the mean levels of estrogenicity in breast milk were approximately 8-13.5 times higher than those in maternal serum compared at the same period. However, no correlation was found between estrogenicity levels in serum and breast milk, leading to decreased accuracy in predicted infant exposure by maternal serum.

Neurogenetics of dopaminergic receptor supersensitivity in activation of brain reward circuitry and relapse: proposing "deprivation-amplification relapse therapy" (DART). It is well known that after prolonged abstinence, individuals who use their drug of choice experience a powerful euphoria that often precipitates relapse. While a biological explanation for this conundrum has remained elusive, we hypothesize that this clinically observed "supersensitivity" might be tied to genetic dopaminergic polymorphisms. Another therapeutic conundrum relates to the paradoxical finding that the dopaminergic agonist bromocriptine induces stronger activation of brain reward circuitry in individuals who carry the DRD2 A1 allele compared with DRD2 A2 allele carriers. Because carriers of the A1 allele relative to the A2 allele of the DRD2 gene have significantly lower D2 receptor density, a reduced sensitivity to dopamine agonist activity would be expected in the former. Thus, it is perplexing that with low D2 density there is an increase in reward sensitivity with the dopamine D2 agonist bromocriptine. Moreover, under chronic or long-term therapy with D2 agonists, such as bromocriptine, it has been shown in vitro that there is a proliferation of D2 receptors. One explanation for this relates to the demonstration that the A1 allele of the DRD2 gene is associated with increased striatal activity of L-amino acid decarboxylase, the final step in the biosynthesis of dopamine. This appears to be a protective mechanism against low receptor density and would favor the utilization of an amino acid neurotransmitter precursor like L-tyrosine for preferential synthesis of dopamine. This seems to lead to receptor proliferation to normal levels and results in significantly better treatment compliance only in A1 carriers. We propose that low D2 receptor density and polymorphisms of the D2 gene are associated with risk for relapse of substance abuse, including alcohol dependence, heroin craving, cocaine dependence, methamphetamine abuse, nicotine sensitization, and glucose craving. With this in mind, we suggest a putative physiological mechanism that may help to explain the enhanced sensitivity following intense acute dopaminergic D2 receptor activation: "denervation supersensitivity." Rats with unilateral depletions of neostriatal dopamine display increased sensitivity to dopamine agonists estimated to be 30 to 100 x in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rotational model. Given that mild striatal dopamine D2 receptor proliferation occurs (20%-40%), it is difficult to explain the extent of behavioral supersensitivity by a simple increase in receptor density. Thus, the administration of dopamine D2 agonists would target D2 sensitization and attenuate relapse, especially in D2 receptor A1 allele carriers. This hypothesized mechanism is supported by clinical trials utilizing amino acid neurotransmitter precursors, enkephalinase, and catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) enzyme inhibition, which have resulted in attenuated relapse rates in reward deficiency syndrome (RDS) probands. If future translational research reveals that dopamine agonist therapy reduces relapse in RDS, it would support the proposed concept, which we term "deprivation-amplification relapse therapy" (DART). This term couples the mechanism for relapse, which is "deprivation-amplification," especially in DRD2 A1 allele carriers with natural D2 agonist therapy utilizing amino acid precursors and COMT and enkepalinase inhibition therapy.

Uremic toxins originating from colonic microbial metabolism. Numerous molecules, which are either excreted or metabolized by the kidney, accumulate in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). These uremic retention molecules (URMs), contributing to the syndrome of uremia, may be classified according to their site of origin, that is, endogenous metabolism, microbial metabolism, or exogenous intake. It is increasingly recognized that bacterial metabolites, such as phenols, indoles, and amines, may contribute to uremic toxicity. In vitro studies have implicated bacterial URMs in CKD progression, cardiovascular disease, and bone and mineral disorders. Furthermore, several observational studies have demonstrated a link between serum levels of bacterial URMs and clinical outcomes. Bacterial metabolism may therefore be an important therapeutic target in CKD. There is evidence that besides reduced renal clearance, increased colonic generation and absorption explain the high levels of bacterial URMs in CKD. Factors promoting URM generation and absorption include an increased ratio of dietary protein to carbohydrate due to insufficient intake of fiber and/or reduced intestinal protein assimilation, as well as prolonged colonic transit time. Two main strategies exist to reduce bacterial URM levels: interventions that modulate intestinal bacterial growth (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics, dietary modification) and adsorbent therapies that bind bacterial URMs in the intestines to reduce their absorption (e.g., AST-120, sevelamer). The efficacy and clinical benefit of these strategies are currently an active area of interest.

A regional initiative to reduce skin infections amongst aboriginal children living in remote communities of the Northern Territory, Australia. Linked to extreme rates of chronic heart and kidney disease, pyoderma is endemic amongst Aboriginal children in Australia's Northern Territory (NT). Many of those with pyoderma will also have scabies. We report the results of a community-based collaboration within the East Arnhem Region, which aimed to reduce the prevalence of both skin infections in Aboriginal children. Commencing September 2004, we conducted an ecological study that included active surveillance for skin infections amongst children aged <15 years in five remote East Arnhem communities over a three year period. Screening was undertaken by trained local community workers, usually accompanied by another project team member, using a standard data collection form. Skin infections were diagnosed clinically with the aid of a pictorial flip chart developed for the purpose. Topical 5% permethrin was provided for age-eligible children and all household contacts whenever scabies was diagnosed, whilst those with pyoderma were referred to the clinic for treatment in accordance with current guidelines. In addition, annual mass scabies treatment (5% permethrin cream) was offered to all community residents in accordance with current guidelines but was not directly observed. Pyoderma and scabies prevalence per month was determined from 6038 skin assessments conducted on 2329 children. Pyoderma prevalence dropped from 46.7% at baseline to a median of 32.4% (IQR 28.9%-41.0%) during the follow-up period - an absolute reduction of 14.7% (IQR 4.7%-16.8%). Compared to the first 18 months of observation, there was an absolute reduction in pyoderma prevalence of 18 cases per 100 children (95%CI -21.0, -16.1, p</=0.001) over the last 18 months. Treatment uptake increased over the same period (absolute difference 13.4%, 95%CI 3.3, 23.6). While scabies prevalence was unchanged, the prevalence of infected scabies (that is with superimposed pyoderma) decreased from 3.7% (95%CI 2.4, 4.9) to 1.5% (95%CI 0.7, 2.2), a relative reduction of 59%. Although pyoderma prevalence remained unacceptably high, there was a substantial reduction overall with improvements in treatment uptake a critical factor. More acceptable alternatives, such as cotrimoxazole for pyoderma and ivermectin as a community-wide scabicide, warrant further investigation in these settings. We are encouraged by progress made through this work, where local action was led by local community members and primary health care providers with external training and support.

Prevalence and costs of acute and chronic potentially avoidable pediatric hospitalizations in Tennessee. Potentially avoidable pediatric hospitalizations (PAPH) can now be identified using an analytical tool developed by the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ). We apply this new tool to Tennessee inpatient discharge records for 2005 to determine the prevalence of PAPH and analyze the variation patterns of PAPH across racial, gender, and insurance status lines. Retrospective analysis of administrative data based on the UB-92 claims forms submitted by all short-term acute-care hospitals in Tennessee for 2005. Tennessee had higher prevalence rates of PAPH than seen in the nation overall for four of the five Ambulatory-Care Sensitive Conditions (ACSC), identified by AHRQ as those hospitalizations which can potentially be avoided. Variations of the rates of PAPH across racial, gender and insurance subgroups were found to mirror those found for pediatric hospitalizations for all conditions. However, when PAPH were grouped according to whether they were chronic or acute in terms of their primary admitting condition, Black children were over-represented in PAPH for chronic conditions such as asthma and diabetes. In addition, Black children's average costs are significantly higher than those for White children irrespective of whether the admitting condition was chronic or acute. The high rates of PAPH reported in this study imply a weakness in Tennessee's primary care for children. These high rates also point out opportunities for reducing expensive hospitalizations associated with poorly controlled diabetes, asthma exacerbations, and dehydration due to gastroenteritis.


Cold-active extracellular alkaline protease from an alkaliphilic Stenotrophomonas maltophilia: production of enzyme and its industrial applications.

Role of arginine guanidinium moiety in nitric-oxide synthase mechanism of oxygen activation. Nitric-oxide synthases (NOS) are highly regulated heme-thiolate enzymes that catalyze two oxidation reactions that sequentially convert the substrate L-Arg first to N(omega)-hydroxyl-L-arginine and then to L-citrulline and nitric oxide. Despite numerous investigations, the detailed molecular mechanism of NOS remains elusive and debatable. Much of the dispute in the various proposed mechanisms resides in the uncertainty concerning the number and sources of proton transfers. Although specific protonation events are key features in determining the specificity and efficiency of the two catalytic steps, little is known about the role and properties of protons from the substrate, cofactors, and H-bond network in the vicinity of the heme active site. In this study, we have investigated the role of the acidic proton from the L-Arg guanidinium moiety on the stability and reactivity of the ferrous heme-oxy complex intermediate by exploiting a series of L-Arg analogues exhibiting a wide range of guanidinium pK(a) values. Using electrochemical and vibrational spectroscopic techniques, we have analyzed the effects of the analogues on the heme, including characteristics of its proximal ligand, heme conformation, redox potential, and electrostatic properties of its distal environment. Our results indicate that the substrate guanidinium pK(a) value significantly affects the H-bond network near the heme distal pocket. Our results lead us to propose a new structural model where the properties of the guanidinium moiety finely control the proton transfer events in NOS and tune its oxidative chemistry. This model may account for the discrepancies found in previously proposed mechanisms of NOS oxidation processes.

Central control of fever and female body temperature by RANKL/RANK. Receptor-activator of NF-kappaB ligand (TNFSF11, also known as RANKL, OPGL, TRANCE and ODF) and its tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-family receptor RANK are essential regulators of bone remodelling, lymph node organogenesis and formation of a lactating mammary gland. RANKL and RANK are also expressed in the central nervous system. However, the functional relevance of RANKL/RANK in the brain was entirely unknown. Here we report that RANKL and RANK have an essential role in the brain. In both mice and rats, central RANKL injections trigger severe fever. Using tissue-specific Nestin-Cre and GFAP-Cre rank(floxed) deleter mice, the function of RANK in the fever response was genetically mapped to astrocytes. Importantly, Nestin-Cre and GFAP-Cre rank(floxed) deleter mice are resistant to lipopolysaccharide-induced fever as well as fever in response to the key inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta and TNFalpha. Mechanistically, RANKL activates brain regions involved in thermoregulation and induces fever via the COX2-PGE(2)/EP3R pathway. Moreover, female Nestin-Cre and GFAP-Cre rank(floxed) mice exhibit increased basal body temperatures, suggesting that RANKL and RANK control thermoregulation during normal female physiology. We also show that two children with RANK mutations exhibit impaired fever during pneumonia. These data identify an entirely novel and unexpected function for the key osteoclast differentiation factors RANKL/RANK in female thermoregulation and the central fever response in inflammation.

Influence of illusory kinesthesia by vibratory tendon stimulation on acute pain after surgery for distal radius fractures: a quasi-randomized controlled study. We investigated the effects of inducing an illusion of motion by tendon vibration on sensory and emotional aspects of pain and range of motion in patients with fractures of the distal radius. A quasi-randomized controlled trial. Kawachi General Hospital, Japan. A total of 26 patients with fractures of the distal radius were distributed quasi-randomly to either the illusory kinesthesia group (nâ=â13) or control group (nâ=â13). The intervention was performed on seven consecutive days from postoperative Day 1. Evaluation was performed at seven days, one month, and two months after the surgery. Data were collected for pain at rest, movement pain, the pain catastrophizing scale, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and range of motion. The illusory kinesthesia group reported improved pain at rest (pâ<â0.001), movement pain (pâ<â0.001), pain catastrophizing scale (pâ<â0.001), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (pâ<â0.01), and range of motion (pâ<â0.05) compared with the control group at seven days, one month, and two months after the surgery. The mean (SD) score of the visual analogue scale of pain at rest was 51.3 (16.8) at one day and 4.2 (4.7) at seven days in the illusory kinesthesia group, and 56.8 (22.1) at one day and 35.5 (16.2) at seven days in the control group. Illusory kinesthesia group improves the sensory and emotion aspects of pain in patients with fractures of the distal radius.

Cerebellar theta oscillations are synchronized during hippocampal theta-contingent trace conditioning. The hippocampus and cerebellum are critically involved in trace eyeblink classical conditioning (EBCC). The mechanisms underlying the hippocampal-cerebellar interaction during this task are not well-understood, although hippocampal theta (3-7 Hz) oscillations are known to reflect a favorable state for EBCC. Two groups of rabbits received trace EBCC in which a brain-computer interface administered trials in either the explicit presence or absence of naturally occurring hippocampal theta. A high percentage of robust theta led to a striking enhancement of learning accompanied by rhythmic theta-band (6-7 Hz) oscillations in the interpositus nucleus (IPN) and cerebellar cortex that were time-locked both to hippocampal rhythms and sensory stimuli during training. Rhythmic oscillations were absent in the cerebellum of the non-theta group. These data strongly suggest a beneficial impact of theta-based coordination of hippocampus and cerebellum and, importantly, demonstrate that hippocampal theta oscillations can be used to index, and perhaps modulate, the functional properties of the cerebellum.

Nuclear localization of dengue virus capsid protein is required for DAXX interaction and apoptosis. Dengue virus capsid protein (DENVC) localizes to both the cytoplasm and nucleus of dengue virus-infected cells. DENV C contains three nuclear localization signals (NLS), (6)KKAR(9), (73)KKSK(76), and the bipartite signal (85)RKeigrmlnilnRRRR(100). Stable HepG2 cells constitutively expressing DENV C, DENV C (Delta 85-100) and DENV C (Delta 73-100) were constructed to clarify whether nuclear translocation of DENV C affected apoptosis in liver cell line. While the wild-type DENV C could translocate into the nuclei of HepG2 cells, the mutant DENV Cs were restricted to the cytoplasm. The loss of nuclear localization of both mutant DENV Cs resulted in the disruption of their interactions with the apoptotic protein Daxx. Interestingly, upon treatment with anti-Fas antibody, the HepG2 cells expressing the wild-type DENV C showed significantly more apoptosis compared with the HepG2 cells expressing either mutant DENV C. To identify the amino acids required for DAXX interaction and apoptosis, substitution mutations either (K73A/K74A) or (R85A/K86A) were introduced into the C-terminal region of DENV C, and tested whether these mutations affected its interaction with Daxx and apoptosis. The results demonstrate that (73)KK and (85)RK of DENV C are important for its nuclear localization, interaction with DAXX and induction of apoptosis. This work is the first to demonstrate that nuclear localization of DENV C is required for DAXX interaction and apoptosis.

[Functional results in myringoplasties]. The aim of this study was to assess hearing improvement after myringoplasty. We present a retrospective study with a total of 119 cases undergoing myringoplasty at our Department analyzing the air conduction thresholds before and 6 months after surgery. We conducted an analysis of variance for the different variables and contrasted hypotheses using Student's T-test. We obtained a hearing improvement at all frequencies, except at 8.000 Hz, at which surgery noticeably worsens hearing. The lower the frequency, the higher the hearing improvement, with the best results at 250 Hz, where the mean hearing improvement reached 13.49 dB. Myringoplasty is an effective technique in the recovery of hearing thresholds secondary to a tympanic membrane perforation.

Nuclear respiratory factor 2 induces the expression of many but not all human proteins acting in mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication. In mammals, NRF-2 (nuclear respiratory factor 2), also named GA-binding protein, is an Ets family transcription factor that controls many genes involved in cell cycle progression and protein synthesis as well as in mitochondrial biogenesis. In this paper, we analyzed the role of NRF-2 in the regulation of human genes involved in mitochondrial DNA transcription and replication. By a combination of bioinformatic and biochemical approaches, we found that the factor binds in vitro and in vivo to the proximal promoter region of the genes coding for the transcription termination factor mTERF, the RNA polymerase POLRMT, the B subunit of the DNA polymerase-gamma, the DNA helicase TWINKLE, and the single-stranded DNA-binding protein mtSSB. The role of NRF-2 in modulating the expression of those genes was further established by RNA interference and overexpression strategies. On the contrary, we found that NRF-2 does not control the genes for the subunit A of DNA polymerase-gamma and for the transcription repressor MTERF3; we suggest that these genes are under regulatory mechanisms that do not involve NRF proteins. Since NRFs are known to positively control the expression of transcription-activating proteins, the novelty emerging from our data is that proteins playing antithetical roles in mitochondrial DNA transcription, namely activators and repressors, are under different regulatory pathways. Finally, we developed a more stringent consensus with respect to the general consensus of NRF-2/GA-binding protein when searching for NRF-2 binding sites in the promoter of mitochondrial proteins.

Quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis reveals Î³-bisabolene inducing p53-mediated apoptosis of human oral squamous cell carcinoma via HDAC2 inhibition and ERK1/2 activation. Î³-Bisabolene, one of main components in cardamom, showed potent in vitro and in vivo anti-proliferative activities against human oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Î³-Bisabolene activated caspases-3/9 and decreased mitochondrial memebrane potential, leading to apoptosis of OSCC cell lines (Ca9-22 and SAS), but not normal oral fibroblast cells. Phosphoproteome profiling of OSCC cells treated with Î³-bisabolene was identified using TiO2-PDMS plate and LC-MS/MS, then confirmed using Western blotting and real-time RT-PCR assays. Phosphoproteome profiling revealed that Î³-bisabolene increased the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, protein phosphatases 1 (PP1), and p53, as well as decreased the phosphorylation of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) in the process of apoptosis induction. Protein-protein interaction network analysis proposed the involvement of PP1-HDAC2-p53 and ERK1/2-p53 pathways in Î³-bisabolene-induced apoptosis. Subsequent assays indicated Î³-bisabolene eliciting p53 acetylation that enhanced the expression of p53-regulated apoptotic genes. PP1 inhibitor-2 restored the status of HDAC2 phosphorylation, reducing p53 acetylation and PUMA mRNA expression in Î³-bisabolene-treated Ca9-22 and SAS cells. Meanwhile, MEK and ERK inhibitors significantly decreased Î³-bisabolene-induced PUMA expression in both cancer cell lines. Notably, the results ascertained the involvement of PP1-HDAC2-p53 and ERK1/2-p53 pathways in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis of Î³-bisabolene-treated cells. This study demonstrated Î³-bisabolene displaying potent anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing activities against OSCC in vitro and in vivo, elucidating molecular mechanisms of Î³-bisabolene-induced apoptosis. The novel insight could be useful for developing anti-cancer drugs.

Transient beta-catenin stabilization modifies lineage output from human thymic CD34+CD1a- progenitors. Increasing evidence includes Wnt proteins inside the group of master-signaling pathways that govern immune and nonimmune differentiation systems, fundamental for normal development and homeostasis. Although their precise functions in bone marrow and thymus are still controversial, numerous studies have shown that Wnt signaling is able to control the proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells and thymic progenitors and might also affect their cell-fate decisions and subsequent maturation. In the present work, we analyze the effect of transient stimulation of the canonical Wnt pathway in the differentiation potential of Lin(-)CD34(+) CD1a(-) human thymic progenitors, a multipotent and heterogeneous cell population that has the capacity to develop into T cells, NK cells, monocytes, cDC, and pDC. Our results demonstrate that giving a boost to canonical Wnt signaling, triggered by transient exposure to Wnt3a or LiCl, the differentiation capacity of thymic progenitors changes, enhancing NK cell production. On the contrary, Wnt3a- or LiCl-pretreated thymic progenitors generate a significantly lower number of myeloid lineage cells, monocytes, and cDC and exhibit a reduced capacity to differentiate into pDC lineage. As a possible mechanism for this effect, we show that Wnt3a- and LiCl-pretreated progenitors change their membrane levels of receptors for cytokines pivotal for their expansion and differentiation, such as Flt3L. Moreover, canonical Wnt pathway stimulation modifies the transcription factor profile of CD34(+)CD1(-) thymocytes, increasing Hes-1 and ID3 expression levels.

Change in public satisfaction with community pharmacy services in Tartu, Estonia, between 1993 and 2005. The health care systems of Estonia and other Baltic States underwent major reforms between restoration of independence from the USSR and admittance to the European Union. These reforms included changes to the regulations regarding the ownership, location, and number of community pharmacies. The objective of this study was to analyze changes in access to, image of, and satisfaction with community pharmacy services in Tartu, Estonia, between 1993 and 2005. A survey instrument was mailed to a stratified random sample of 713 Estonians aged 20-69 years living in Tartu in 1993 and again to 1000 Estonians aged 20-69 years living in Tartu in 2005. Completed survey instruments were returned by 448 (63%) respondents in 1993 and 386 (39%) respondents in 2005. Respondents in 2005 reported more frequent visits to pharmacies than respondents in 1993 (P=.012) and were more likely to indicate that pharmacies have more appropriate locations and opening hours (P<.001). In 2005, 71% of respondents reported always visiting the same pharmacy compared to 35% in 1993. The perceived trustworthiness of pharmacists remained constant. Respondents believed that the role of the pharmacist as a provider of drug information should be expanded; however, demand for extended community pharmacy services was low. Postindependence reforms to health care and pharmacy systems in Estonia have coincided with greater utilization of community pharmacy services. Higher rates of utilization and continued good standing within the community suggest that pharmacies are potentially well placed to make additional contributions to the evolving primary health care system in Estonia.

Age differences in the effects of conceptual integration training on resource allocation in sentence processing. This research examined age differences in the accommodation of reading strategies as a consequence of explicit instruction in conceptual integration. In Experiment 1, young, middle-aged, and older adults read sentences for delayed recall using a moving-window method. Readers in an experimental group received instruction in making conceptual links during reading while readers in a control group were simply encouraged to allocate effort. Regression analysis to decompose word-by-word reading times in each condition isolated the time allocated to conceptual processing at the point in the text at which new concepts were introduced, as well as at clause and sentence boundaries. While younger adults responded to instructions by differentially allocating effort to sentence wrap-up, older adults allocated effort to intrasentence wrap-up and on new concepts as they were introduced, suggesting that older readers optimized their allocation of effort to linguistic computations for textbase construction within their processing capacity. Experiment 2 verified that conceptual integration training improved immediate recall among older readers as a consequence of engendering allocation to conceptual processing.

Essential Oils as "A Cry for Help". A Review.

Self-criticism of physicians, patient participation and risk competence. Self-criticism of physicians and patient participation are the pillars of modern medical ethics and medical programmes. Patients expect risk minimisation from physicians, mostly without realising how much they could actively do themselves in this respect. But what about the willingness of German people to take risks, how high is it really at present? Direct empirical data are not available, but results from general empirical research show that people's willingness to take risks is probably rather low. Post-heroic societies of welfare states are less likely to take risks than supposedly heroic ones. Therefore, the question whether it is responsible for medical experts to transfer even more responsibility to non-medical laypeople becomes increasingly important in a social context.  Mediziner-Selbstkritik und Patienten-Mitbestimmung sind die Grundpfeiler moderner Medizin-Ethik und -Programmatik. Von Ãrzten erwarten Patienten eine Risikominimierung ohne meist zu realisieren, wieviel sie selbst aktiv beitragen kÃ¶nnten. Wie hoch ist aber derzeit die Risikobereitschaft der BundesbÃ¼rger wirklich? Direkte empirische Daten gibt es dazu nicht. Abgeleitet aus der allgemeinen historischen Empirie kann man aber annehmen, dass sie grundsÃ¤tzlich sehr gering ist. Die postheroische Gesellschaft des Wohlfahrtstaates toleriert Risiken sicher weniger als die vermeintlich heroische. In diesem Zusammenhang bekommt die Frage, ob es zu verantworten ist, wenn die medizinisch Kompetenten noch stÃ¤rker ihre Verantwortung auf die medizinisch Nicht-Kompetenten Ã¼bertragen, eine gesellschaftliche AktualitÃ¤t.

Neuroendocrine consequences of anorexia nervosa in adolescents. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a condition of severe undernutrition characterized by alterations in multiple neuroendocrine axes and peptides that signal or regulate energy intake. These alterations include a state of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, a nutritionally acquired resistance to growth hormone (GH) with low IGF-1 levels, relative hypercortisolemia, low total T3 despite normal TSH, low levels of leptin and insulin, and elevated levels of ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY) and possibly adiponectin. Although many of these changes are adaptive to low weight, they can impact bone metabolism, body composition, reproductive function and statural growth. Low bone mass is characteristic of AN in both adolescent boys and girls. In girls, sites of trabecular bone are more likely to be affected than sites of cortical bone, whereas in boys with AN, sites of cortical bone are more commonly affected. Bone microarchitecture is also affected in adolescent girls with AN, with a decrease in trabecular thickness and bone trabecular volume, and an increase in trabecular separation. Important predictors of low bone density include nutritional factors, body composition, hypogonadism, low IGF-1, elevated cortisol and PYY levels, with possible contributions of low insulin. Weight gain is associated with a stabilization of bone density, although residual deficits persist in the short term, and in some cases, long term.


Radiographic and anatomic basis of endoscopic anterior craniocervical decompression: a comparison of endonasal, transoral, and transcervical approaches.

Changes in the oral health of US children and adolescents and dental public health infrastructure since the release of the Healthy People 2010 Objectives. We examined progress in US children's oral health and dental public health infrastructure since the Healthy People 2010 Oral Health Objectives were issued. We summarize trends in the prevalence of dental caries and dental sealants on the basis of national and state-specific data. Trends in state oral health program activities, funding, and staffing were derived from annual surveys. The prevalence of dental caries in primary teeth of children aged 2-4 years increased from 18% in 1988-1994 to 24% in 1999-2004. Racial disparities persisted in that age group, with caries significantly more prevalent among non-Hispanic black and Mexican American children than among non-Hispanic white children. Caries prevalence in primary teeth of non-Hispanic white children aged 6-8 years remained unchanged, but increased among non-Hispanic black and Mexican American children. State-specific prevalence of caries among third-graders ranged from 40.6% to 72.2%. Caries in permanent teeth declined among children and adolescents, while the prevalence of dental sealants increased significantly. State oral health programs' funding and staffing remained modest, although the proportion of states with sealant programs increased 75% in 2000 to 85% in 2007 and the proportion with fluoride varnish programs increased from 13% to 53%. Progress toward improving the oral health of America during the past decade has been mixed. Greater attention to the oral health of young children is clearly needed, and child health professionals can be valuable partners in the effort. With continued high prevalence of a largely preventable disease, ongoing problems with access to basic oral health services, and increased national attention to health care reform, there is a clear need and opportunity for governments to make serious and sustained investments in dental public health.


Cryopreservation of in vitro grown shoot tips and apical meristems of the forage legume Arachis pintoi.

Resistance gene patterns of tetracycline resistant Escherichia coli of human and porcine origin. Resistance transfer from animals to humans (and vice versa) is a frequently discussed topic in human and veterinary medicine, albeit relevant studies focus mainly on phenotypic antibiotic resistance. In order to get a comparative insight regarding the distribution of selected resistance genes [tet(A/B/C/D/M/K/L/O/S/W/Z), sulI, II, III, str(A/B), aad(A)] in Escherichia coli of different origins, phenotypically tetracycline resistant isolates of porcine and human origin (n=137 and 152) were investigated using PCR. The most common gene was tet(A) in porcine, but tet(B) in human isolates (>55%). Tet(C/M/D) were rare (1-7%); tet(K/L/O/S/W/Z) were not detected. Co-occurrence of tet(A) and tet(B) was more frequent in human strains (11% vs. 2%). 88% of the porcine isolates had one, and 9% had two tet-genes. By contrast, only 69% of the human strains had one tet-gene, whereas 17% were carriers of two tet-determinants. The most common sulfonamide resistance gene was represented by sulII (40% in porcine, 62% in human isolates), followed by sulI. SulIII was present in eight isolates. Streptomycin resistance was mostly mediated by str(A)/str(B) in porcine, and by str(A)/str(B)/aad(A) in human strains (35% each). In one E. coli of human origin, 7 resistance genes were simultaneously detected. Co-occurrence of 5 or 6 resistance genes was more present in human strains, whereas porcine isolates carried more often only 1-4 genes. The huge diversities between gene patterns of bacteria of human and porcine origin indicate that genetic transfers between microorganisms from different sources are less frequent than transfers within populations of the same source.

[Scolitids (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) associated to the cocoa agroecosystem in Tabasco, Mexico]. The Scolytidae fauna associated to the cacao agroecosystem in Tabasco, Mexico was studied during 2007. Adult insects were captured by using ethanol and light traps, and by direct collecting in their host plants. 3,192 specimens of 34 species belonging to 18 genera of Scolytidae were collected. Twenty-two species are new records for the State of Tabasco. The genera with more species were Xyleborus (6) and Hypothenemus (6). We conclude that the Scolytidae fauna associated to the cacao agroecosystem captured with the three trap systems are similar through the year of study. We also conclude that although the ethanol traps were more efficient, obtaining the highest species diversity, the use of other methods is important.

Muscle fatigue of quadriceps in paraplegics: comparison between single vs. multi-pad electrode surface stimulation. We hypothesize that the asynchronous low frequency stimulation of pads within multi-pad electrode will be less fatiguing compared to the conventional stimulation (two single pad electrodes) when generating comparable large forces of paralyzed human muscles. The experiments to verify the hypothesis were conducted on quadriceps of six individuals with chronic spinal cord injury (ASIA score A) who had not participated in any electrical stimulation program. The following stimulation protocols were compared: stimulation with a self adhesive 7 cm x 10 cm Pals Platinum cathode positioned over the top of the quadriceps (f = 40 Hz), and four oval 4 cm x 6 cm cathodes positioned over the proximal upper leg (f = 16 Hz). The anode in both cases was the 7 cm x 10 cm Pals Platinum electrode positioned over the distal part of the quadriceps. We measured the knee joint torque vs. time with a custom made apparatus, and estimated the interval before the knee joint torque decreased to 70% of the maximum. Mean fatigue interval increase for the four-pad stimulation protocol vs. single-pad stimulation protocol was 153.18%. This suggests that the use of multi-pad electrodes is favorable in cases where a prolonged stimulation of muscles is required.

Effects of inhaled Linalool in anxiety, social interaction and aggressive behavior in mice. Aromatherapy uses essential oils (EOs) for several medical purposes, including relaxation. The association between the use of aromas and a decrease in anxiety could be a valuable instrument in managing anxiety in an ever increasing anxiogenic daily life style. Linalool is a monoterpene commonly found as the major volatile component of EOs in several aromatic plant species. Adding to previously reported sedative effects of inhaled linalool, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of inhaled linalool on anxiety, aggressiveness and social interaction in mice. Additionally, we investigated the effects of inhaled linalool on the acquisition phase of a step-down memory task in mice. Inhaled linalool showed anxiolytic properties in the light/dark test, increased social interaction and decreased aggressive behavior; impaired memory was only seen the higher dose of linalool. These results strengthen the suggestion that inhaling linalool rich essential oils can be useful as a mean to attain relaxation and counteract anxiety.

Impact of plant architecture versus leaf quality on attack by leaf-tying caterpillars on five oak species. Because shelter-building herbivorous insect species often consider structural features of their host plants in selecting construction sites, their probability of attack is likely to be a function of some combination of plant architectural traits and leaf quality factors. We tested the hypothesis that plant architecture, in the form of the number of touching leaves, influences interspecific variation in attack by leaf-tying caterpillars in five species of sympatric Missouri oaks (Quercus). We compared colonization on control branches, in which both architecture and leaf quality were potentially important, with colonization on experimental branches for which we controlled for the effects of architecture by creating equal numbers of artificial ties. Colonization of artificial ties was highly correlated with natural colonization on neighboring control branches, suggesting that leaf quality factors and not architecture influenced interspecific variation in attack by leaf-tying caterpillars. Of the leaf quality factors measured (water, protein-binding capacity, nitrogen, specific leaf area, pubescence, and toughness), nitrogen was the most explanatory. With the exception of white oak, natural leaf tie colonization was positively correlated with nitrogen availability (ratio of nitrogen to protein-binding capacity), and negatively correlated with protein-binding capacity of leaf extracts. Both host plant species and subgenus oak influenced the community composition of leaf-tying caterpillars and the non-tying symbionts colonizing the ties. Host plant differences in leaf nitrogen content were positively correlated with pupal weight of one of two caterpillar species reared on all five host plant species. Thus, interspecific differences in nitrogen, nitrogen availability, and protein-binding capacity of leaf extracts are the best predictors at this time of interspecific differences in attack by leaf-tying caterpillars, in turn affecting their success on individual host plants in the laboratory.

Introducing mother's curse: low male fertility associated with an imported mtDNA haplotype in a captive colony of brown hares. Mitochondrial DNA mutations create variation in the efficiency of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway and therefore cellular energy production. Mildly deleterious mutations may reduce the performance of sperm cells in particular, due to their high energy requirements and low number of mitochondria, yet have little or no effect on the viability of somatic cells or ova. Mutations will be maintained in the population, despite the fitness cost for males, because mtDNA is passed down the female line. We looked for this so-called mother's curse effect in our captive colony of European brown hares. Significantly reduced male reproductive success was detected for a divergent haplotype that could be traced back to hares imported from a remote population. Median reproductive success for these hares was 0.17 compared to 0.49 for the indigenous haplotypes (Wilcoxon rank-sum, P = 0.002). No difference was detected for female reproductive success, nor were we able to find a nuclear DNA component to variation in male fertility. Our data are strong evidence for a mother's curse effect persisting despite multiple crossings over seven generations. These data raise important issues relating to the reproductive fitness of small or intermixing populations and have particular implications for the management of populations for conservation.

A spectrum of severe familial liver disorders associate with telomerase mutations. Telomerase is an enzyme specialized in maintaining telomere lengths in highly proliferative cells. Loss-of-function mutations cause critical telomere shortening and are associated with the bone marrow failure syndromes dyskeratosis congenita and aplastic anemia and with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Here, we sought to determine the spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with telomerase loss-of-function mutations. Sixty-nine individuals from five unrelated families with a variety of hematologic, hepatic, and autoimmune disorders were screened for telomerase complex gene mutations; leukocyte telomere length was measured by flow fluorescence in situ hybridization in mutation carriers and some non-carriers; the effects of the identified mutations on telomerase activity were determined; and genetic and clinical data were correlated. In six generations of a large family, a loss-of-function mutation in the telomerase enzyme gene TERT associated with severe telomere shortening and a range of hematologic manifestations, from macrocytosis to acute myeloid leukemia, with severe liver diseases marked by fibrosis and inflammation, and one case of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis but not with autoimmune disorders. Additionally, we identified four unrelated families in which loss-of-function TERC or TERT gene mutations tracked with marrow failure, pulmonary fibrosis, and a spectrum of liver disorders. These results indicate that heterozygous telomerase loss-of-function mutations associate with but are not determinant of a large spectrum of hematologic and liver abnormalities, with the latter sometimes occurring in the absence of marrow failure. Our findings, along with the link between pulmonary fibrosis and telomerase mutations, also suggest a common pathogenic mechanism for fibrotic diseases in which defective telomere repair plays important role.

Parental combat injury and early child development: a conceptual model for differentiating effects of visible and invisible injuries. The injuries (physical and emotional) sustained by service members during combat influence all members of a family system. This review used a systemic framework to conceptualize the direct and indirect effects of a service member's injury on family functioning, with a specific focus on young children. Using a meta-ethnographic approach to synthesize the health research literature from a variety of disciplines, this review makes relevant linkages to health care professionals working with injured veterans. Studies were included that examined how family functioning (psychological and physical) is impacted by parental illness; parental injury; and posttraumatic stress disorder. The synthesis of literature led to the development of a heuristic model that illustrates both direct and indirect effects of parental injury on family functioning and the development of young children. It further illustrates the contextual factors or moderating variables that buffer detrimental effects and promote family resilience. This model can be a foundation for future research, intervention, and policy.

Drug-eluting coronary artery stents. Many advances have been made in the percutaneous treatment of coronary artery disease during the past 30 years. Although balloon angioplasty alone is still performed, the use of coronary artery stents is much more common. Approximately 40 percent of patients treated with balloon angioplasty developed restenosis, and this was reduced to roughly 30 percent with the use of bare-metal stents. However, restenosis within the stent can occur and is difficult to treat. Drug-eluting stents were developed to lower the rate of restenosis, which now occurs in less than 10 percent of patients treated with these stents. There have been concerns about abrupt thrombosis within drug-eluting stents occurring late after their implantation, leading to acute myocardial infarction and death. Recent studies have alleviated, but not completely dispelled, these concerns. Strict adherence to dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a thienopyridine is required after stent placement, and the premature discontinuation of therapy is the most important risk factor for acute stent thrombosis. Adequate communication between cardiologists and primary care physicians is essential not only to avoid the premature discontinuation of therapy, but also to identify, before stent placement, those patients in whom prolonged antiplatelet therapy may be ill-advised. Elective surgery following stent placement should be delayed until the recommended course of dual antiplatelet therapy has been completed.

The relationship between Sense of Coherence and toothbrushing behaviours in Iranian adolescents in Mashhad. The aim of this study was to assess the association between Sense of Coherence (SOC) and toothbrushing behaviours in Iranian adolescents in Mashhad. A representative stratified random sample of 1054 grade 6 Iranian students, living in Mashhad, answered a 37-item questionnaire with questions on socio-demographic characteristics, frequency of toothbrushing behaviours and Antonovsky's 13-item SOC scale. Binary logistic regression was used to test the association between SOC and toothbrushing behaviours. Higher SOC scores were significantly associated with more frequent toothbrushing behaviours (p=0.01). This positive association remained significant after adjusting for sex and father's education level (p=0.01). When testing this association for the boys and girls separately, the association was significant only for girls (p=0.02). However, the interaction between sex and SOC was not significant (p=0.56). The association between toothbrushing and sex remained significant after adjusting for SOC (p<0.001). Boys had a significantly stronger SOC than girls (p=0.04). SOC was associated with toothbrushing frequency in Iranian adolescents in Mashhad. SOC did not fully explain the sex difference in toothbrushing behaviours.

Metabolic conversion of zearalenone to alpha-zearalenol by goat tissues. Zearalenone (ZEA), an estrogenic mycotoxin produced by several Fusarium species, is converted into a more active metabolite, alpha-zearalenol (alpha-ZOL), and a less active metabolite, beta-zearalenol (beta-ZOL), by liver subcellular fractions, but evidence of this reaction in other tissues is limited. In order to clarify the role of various tissues in ZEA metabolism in ruminant, we investigated the in vitro metabolic conversion of ZEA by various tissues of adult male and female goats. The results indicate that in the liver, alpha-ZOL was a major metabolite in cytosolic fractions, whereas beta-ZOL was a predominant metabolite in microsome fractions. Such a feature of ZEA metabolism was confirmed by the K(m) and V(max) values from an enzyme kinetics experiment. Post-mitochondrial fractions of the liver converted ZEA predominantly to alpha-ZOL, indicating that the goat liver may function as an activation organ rather than as an inactivation organ, for ZEA metabolism in goats. In most other tissues including rumen tissue, the activity converting ZEA to alpha-ZOL was higher than that to beta-ZOL. The amount of alpha-ZOL formed by gastrointestinal tissues was 1/8-1/3 of that by the liver tissue in terms of the amount per mg protein, but the contribution of all gastrointestinal tissues to production of alpha-ZOL was estimated to be comparable to that of the liver because of the large mass of gastrointestinal tissues in ruminants. Overall the results show the importance of not only the liver tissue, but also other tissues, especially gastrointestinal ones, in the formation of a potent estrogenic metabolite, alpha-ZOL.

HIV infections and STI co-infections in men who have sex with men in Belgium: sustained increase in HIV diagnoses. Belgium is currently experiencing an upward trend in the number of new HIV diagnoses characterised by a continuous increase in the number of cases among men who have sex with men (MSM). Based on surveillance data, in the past decade the yearly number of newly diagnosed HIV cases in MSM increased more than threefold, from 101 cases diagnosed in 1999 to 332 cases in 2008. During this period, the majority of new HIV infections in MSM were diagnosed among Belgian citizens (72%), followed by other European nationalities (13%). The increase in HIV diagnoses does not reflect an increase in HIV testing since the number of tests performed nationwide remained remarkably stable over time. The steady increase in the number of newly diagnosed HIV cases among MSM, and the high proportion of MSM among HIV-positive patients co-infected with other sexually transmitted infections (STI) (95.6% in 2008) indicate increases in unsafe sex practices in this group. Development of behavioural surveillance and more qualitative research on reasons for unsafe sex are needed in order to develop more effective prevention strategies.

Alternative user interface devices for improved navigation of CT datasets. The workflow in radiology departments has changed dramatically with the transition to digital PACS, especially with the shift from tile mode to stack mode display of volumetric images. With the increasing number of images in routinely captured datasets, the standard user interface devices (UIDs) become inadequate. One basic approach to improve the navigation of the stack mode datasets is to take advantage of alternative UIDs developed for other domains, such as the computer game industry. We evaluated three UIDs both in clinical practice and in a task-based experiment. After using the devices in the daily image interpretation work, the readers reported that both of the tested alternative UIDs were better in terms of ergonomics compared to the standard mouse and that both alternatives were more efficient when reviewing large CT datasets. In the task-based experiment, one of the tested devices was faster than the standard mouse, while the other alternative was not significantly faster. One of the tested alternative devices showed a larger number of traversed images during the task. The results indicate that alternative user interface devices can improve the navigation of stack mode datasets and that radiologists should consider the potential benefits of alternatives to the standard mouse.

Telemedical diagnosis of retinopathy of prematurity: accuracy of expert versus non-expert graders.

Transverse polarizability of an aligned assembly of charged rods. The low-field transverse polarizability of the counterions condensed on an isolated charged rod is small. We show that it can be much larger if the rod is a member of an assembly of aligned rods. The polarization free energy of the assembly of rods in a transverse field is then similar to its polarization free energy in a field parallel to the rods. The polarization free energy of the assembly in a transverse field becomes lower than in a parallel field if the extent of the assembly (as measured, for example, by the diameter of a cylindrical assembly) is larger than the length of the individual rods. We suggest that this model may provide a reasonable explanation for the occurrence of "anomalous" birefringence in systems of interacting charged rodlike particles.

Cell proliferation following non-thermal plasma is related to reactive oxygen species induced fibroblast growth factor-2 release. Non-thermal dielectric barrier discharge plasma is currently being developed for a wide range of medical applications, including blood coagulation, malignant cell apoptosis, and wound healing. However, the effect of non-thermal plasma on the vasculature is unclear. Blood vessels are affected during plasma treatment of many tissues, and vessels themselves may be an important clinical plasma therapy target. We investigated the effect of non-thermal plasma treatment on endothelial cells, which line the inner surface of blood vessels. Non-thermal plasma treatment at short exposures (up to 30 seconds; 4 J/cm(2)) was relatively non-toxic to endothelial cells. Endothelial cells treated with plasma for 30 seconds demonstrated twice as much proliferation as untreated cells five days after plasma treatment. Proliferation was abrogated by a fibroblast growth factor-2 neutralizing antibody and reactive oxygen species inhibitors. This suggests that plasma-induced endothelial cell proliferation is caused by growth factor release following reactive oxygen species cell membrane damage. These data suggest that low power non-thermal plasma treatment is a potential novel therapy for promotion of endothelial cell mediated angiogenesis.

Chaperone-like activity of alpha-cyclodextrin via hydrophobic nanocavity to protect native structure of ADH. The chaperone action of alpha-cyclodextrin (alpha-CyD), based on providing beneficial microenvironment of hydrophobic nanocavity to form molecular complex with alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) was examined by experimental and computational techniques. The results of UV-vis and dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicated that the chaperone-like activity of alpha-CyD depends on molecular complex formation between alpha-CyD and ADH, which caused to decrease the amount and size of polymerized molecules. Computational calculations of molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and blind docking (BD) demonstrated that alpha-CyD acts as an artificial chaperone because of its high affinity to the region of ADH's two chains interface. The hydrophobic nanocavity of alpha-CyD has the ability to form inclusion complex due to the presence of phenyl ring of aromatic phenylalanine (Phe) residue in the dimeric intersection area. Delocalization of ADH subunits, which causes the exposure of Phe110, takes part in the enzyme polymerization and has proven to be beneficial for aggregation inhibition and solubility enhancement within the host alpha-CyD-nanocavity.

A MIF haplotype is associated with the outcome of patients with severe sepsis: a case control study. Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) plays an important regulatory role in sepsis. In the promoter region a C/G single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at position -173 (rs755622) and a CATT5-8 microsatellite at position -794 are related to modified promoter activity. The purpose of the study was to analyze their association with the incidence and outcome of severe sepsis. Genotype distributions and allele frequencies in 169 patients with severe sepsis, 94 healthy blood donors and 183 postoperative patients without signs of infection or inflammation were analyzed by real time PCR and Sequence analysis. All included individuals were Caucasians. Genotype distribution and allele frequencies of severe sepsis patients were comparable to both control groups. However, the genotype and allele frequencies of both polymorphisms were associated significantly with the outcome of severe sepsis. The highest risk of dying from severe sepsis was detectable in patients carrying a haplotype with the alleles -173 C and CATT7 (p = 0.0005, fisher exact test, RR = 1,806, CI: 1.337 to 2.439). The haplotype with the combination of the -173 C allele and the -794 CATT7 allele may not serve as a marker for susceptibility to sepsis, but may help identify septic patients at risk of dying.

Hypochromic effect of an aqueous monoglucosyl rutin solution caused by green tea catechins. Eight catechins reduced the color of a monoglucosyl rutin solution, the gallate-type catechins having a greater effect than the non-gallate-type catechins. Each catechin formed a 1:1 complex with monoglucosyl rutin. The binding constants of the gallate-type catechins were larger than those of the non-gallate type. These results indicate that the degree of color change in the monoglucosyl rutin solution depended on the ability of each catechin to form a complex with monoglucosyl rutin.

Ovine platelet function is unaffected by extracorporeal membrane oxygenation within the first 24 h. This study investigated platelet dysfunction during short-term extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) and secondarily to determine if hyperoxaemia contributes to this dysfunction. Healthy sheep were anaesthetized and maintained on ECMO for either 2 or 24 h, with or without induction of smoke inhalation acute lung injury. A specialized animal-operating theatre was used to conduct the experimentation. Forty-three healthy female sheep were randomized into either a test or a control group. Following anaesthesia, test groups received ECMO Â± smoke inhalation acute lung injury (SALI), whereas control groups were maintained with ventilation only Â± SALI. Physiological, biochemical and coagulation data were obtained throughout via continuous monitoring and blood sampling. Platelet function was quantified through whole blood impedance aggregometry using Multiplate. Ovine platelet activity induced by adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and collagen was unaffected during the first 24 h of ECMO. However, progressive divergence of ADP-induced platelet activity was noted at cessation of the experiment. PaO2 was inversely related to ADP-dependent platelet activity in the ECMO groups--a relationship not identified in the control groups. ADP and collagen-dependent platelet activity are not significantly affected within the first 24 h of ECMO in sheep. However, dysfunction in ADP-dependent platelet activity may have continued to develop if observed beyond 24 h. Hyperoxaemia during ECMO does appear to affect how platelets react to ADP and may contribute to this developing dysfunction. Long-term animal models and investigation in clinical animals are warranted to fully investigate platelet function during ECMO.

Transdermal granisetron. Granisetron is a highly selective serotonin 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist for the prevention of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. The transdermal granisetron system delivers continuous granisetron (3.1 mg/day) into the systemic circulation (via passive diffusion) for up to 7 days. In a large phase III trial in cancer patients receiving multi-day (3-5 days) moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy, transdermal granisetron applied 24-48 hours prior to chemotherapy and remaining in place for 7 days was noninferior to oral granisetron 2 mg once daily administered for 3-5 days 1 hour prior to chemotherapy. Efficacy was assessed according to the proportion of patients achieving complete response (no vomiting and/or retching, no more than mild nausea, no rescue medication) from the first day, until 24 hours after the start of the last day, of administration of the chemotherapy regimen. In a phase II trial in patients with cancer receiving single-day, moderately-emetogenic chemotherapy, transdermal granisetron applied at least 24 hours prior to chemotherapy and removed after 5 days was as effective as a single oral dose of granisetron 2 mg in achieving total control (no nausea, no vomiting/retching, no use of rescue medication and no study withdrawal) during the delayed (24-120 hours; primary endpoint) period after chemotherapy. Transdermal granisetron was generally well tolerated in clinical trials, with few adverse events being treatment related.

Oncoapoptosis: a novel molecular therapeutic for cancer treatment. Many cancer cells refractory to radiation treatment and chemotherapy proliferate due to loss of intrinsic programmed cell death (apoptosis) regulation. Consequently, the resolution of these cancers are many times outside the management capabilities of conventional therapeutics. We have developed a replication defective herpes simplex virus system which triggers apoptosis specifically in transformed human cells, termed oncoapoptosis. Susceptibility to virus induced cell death is dependent on the p53 protein status in the tumor cells, indicating specific targeting of the treatment. Primary cells which produce functional p53 are resistant to oncoapoptotic killing but not to apoptosis induced by nonviral environmental factors. Thus, induction of apoptosis by nonreplicating virus is a feasible molecular therapeutic approach for killing human cancer cells. Our findings have important implications in designing novel virus-based anticancer strategies.

Relative importance of multiple environmental variables in structuring benthic macroinfaunal assemblages in chronically metal-polluted salt marshes. In this study, we assessed importance of sediment-associated trace metals in structuring benthic macroinfaunal assemblages along multiple environmental gradients in chronically polluted salt marshes of the Arthur Kill - AK (New York, USA). More than 90% of benthic macroinfaunal communities at the northern AK sites consisted of a considerably large number of only a few polychaete and oligochaete species. Approximately 70% of among-site variances in abundance and biomass of benthic macroinfaunal communities was strongly associated with a few environmental variables; only sediment-associated mercury consistently contributed to a significant proportion of the explained variances in species composition along natural environmental gradients (e.g., salinity). Although sediment-associated copper, lead, and zinc were substantially elevated at some of the AK sites, their ecological impacts on benthic macroinfaunal communities appeared to be negligible. These findings suggest that cumulative metal-specific impacts may have played an important role in structuring benthic macroinfaunal communities in chronically polluted AK ecosystems.

Gender difference in the prodromal symptoms of first-episode schizophrenia. To investigate the gender difference of early symptoms appearing before the onset of the psychotic symptoms in patients with first-episode schizophrenia, we reviewed the medical records of 63 patients (38 males, 25 females), who were hospitalized for first-episode schizophrenia. The frequency and duration of prodromal and psychotic symptoms, Clinical Global Impression scale scores, Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale scores at admission, and other clinical characteristics were recorded for all patients. Overall, the most common prodromal symptoms were attenuated positive symptoms (89%), followed by mood symptoms (86%). Negative symptoms were the most common in male patients (97.4%), whereas attenuated positive symptoms were the most common in female patients (84%). Male patients demonstrated more frequent negative, cognitive, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms than female patients did and also showed a tendency of having negative symptoms for the longer period. Correlational analysis showed a significant negative correlation between the duration of negative symptoms and GAF scores at admission in male patients. Our findings suggest that different patterns of prodromal symptoms between male and female begin before the onset of the psychosis. Further prospective studies should be needed.

Tid1 is a new regulator of p53 mitochondrial translocation and apoptosis in cancer. The p53 tumor suppressor protein induces apoptosis in response to genotoxic and environmental stresses. Recent studies have revealed the existence of a transcription-independent mitochondrial p53 apoptotic pathway; however, the mechanism that regulates its translocation to the mitochondria has been unknown. In this study, we show that the tumor suppressor Tid1 forms a complex with p53 under hypoxic conditions that directs p53 translocation to the mitochondria and the subsequent initiation of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Loss of Tid1 expression abrogated p53 translocation to the mitochondria and inhibited apoptosis, whereas the over-expression of Tid1 promoted p53 mitochondrial localization and apoptosis. Tid1's mitochondrial signal sequence and DnaJ domain were both required for the movement of the p53-Tid1 complex from the cytosol to the mitochondria. When Tid is over-expressed in cancer cell lines expressing mutant p53 isoforms defective in transcriptional activity, mitochondrial localization and pro-apoptotic activities of the mutant p53 proteins was restored. Our results establish Tid1 as a novel regulator of p53-mediated apoptosis, and suggest that therapies designed to enhance Tid1's function in promoting mitochondrial localization of p53 and apoptosis could be an effective therapy in many cancers.


Plant Immune Responses: Aphids Strike Back.

Identification and validation of a Lewis x glycomimetic peptide. Glycans play important roles in regulating cell recognition and interactions to fine tune development, and synaptic plasticity and regeneration in the adult nervous system. The spatial and temporal expression pattern of Lewis(x) (a terminal trisaccharide epitope characterized by alpha1,3-fucosyl-N-acetyl-lactosamine) in the nervous system indicates an important role of this epitope in neurogenesis and brain development. Localization of Lewis(x) in the proliferative subventricular zone of the developing nervous system and also its expression on stem cells of the adult nervous system suggests a role in neurogenesis and hence regeneration. To provide an alternative tool to elucidate the functional roles of Lewis(x), we screened a random peptide phage library against a Lewis(x)-specific antibody to identify a Lewis(x) glycomimetic peptide. We identified a peptide that specifically bound to the Lewis(x)-specific antibody and this binding could be competed by the Lewis(x) glycan. Different aspects of the Lewis(x) glycomimetic peptide were investigated by introducing it in in vitro assays measuring neurite outgrowth and in in vivo assays to determine its efficacy in regeneration of peripheral nerve and spinal cord after injury in adult mice. In vitro, neurite outgrowth triggered by the Lewis(x-)carrying adhesion molecule CD24 was abolished alike by the Lewis(x) glycan and the glycomimetic peptide, while no influence of the glycomimetic peptide was seen in regeneration. Our results validate the use of Lewis(x) glycomimetic peptide as a functionally equivalent structure to the Lewis(x) glycan.

Pycnogenol improves left ventricular function in streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats. We studied whether Pycnogenol (PYC) may attenuate the development of experimental streptozotocin-induced diabetic cardiomyopathy in rat. In addition, we aimed to study whether PYC affects cardiac oxidative stress and the protein expression of reactive oxygen species (ROS)-producing molecules (gp91(phox)-containing NADPH oxidase and NO-signalling proteins). Experimental diabetes mellitus was manifested by hyperglycaemia and impaired cardiac function estimated using left ventricular catheterisation in vivo. PYC lowered fasting plasma glucose and normalized basal cardiac function. Excessive oxidative stress in streptozotocin (STZ) hearts, evidenced by 40% increase (P < 0.05) of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentration, was associated with increased expression of gp91(phox) (by 75%, P < 0.05), iNOS (by 40%, P < 0.05) and alpha-tubulin (by 49%, P < 0.05), but unchanged expression of eNOS and its alosteric regulators, as compared to CON. PYC failed to affect these expression abnormalities. Our study shows that PYC corrects diabetic cardiac dysfunction, probably by its metabolic and direct radical scavenging activity without affecting the molecular maladaptations of ROS-producing enzymes and cytoskeletal components.

Morphine prevents the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening through NO/cGMP/PKG/Zn2+/GSK-3beta signal pathway in cardiomyocytes. The aim of this study was to test whether morphine prevents the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening through Zn(2+) and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta). Fluorescence dyes including Newport Green Dichlorofluorescein (DCF), 4-amino-5-methylamino-2',7'-difluorofluorescein (DAF-FM), and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester (TMRE) were used to image free Zn(2+), nitric oxide (NO), and mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), respectively. Fluorescence images were obtained with confocal microscopy. Cardiomyocytes treated with morphine for 10 min showed a significant increase in Newport Green DCF fluorescence intensity, an effect that was reversed by the NO synthase inhibitor N (G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME), indicating that morphine mobilizes Zn(2+) via NO. Morphine rapidly produced NO. ODQ and NS2028, the inhibitors of guanylyl cyclase, prevented Zn(2+) release by morphine, implying that cGMP is involved in the action of morphine. The effect of morphine on Zn(2+) release was also abolished by KT5823, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase G (PKG). Morphine prevented oxidant-induced loss of DeltaPsi(m), indicating that morphine can modulate the mPTP opening. The effect of morphine on the mPTP was reversed by KT5823 and the Zn(2+) chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine (TPEN). The action of morphine on the mPTP was lost in cells transfected with the constitutively active GSK-3beta mutant, suggesting that morphine may prevent the mPTP opening by inactivating GSK-3beta. In support, morphine significantly enhanced phosphorylation of GSK-3beta at Ser(9), and this was blocked by TPEN. GSK-3beta small interfering RNA prevented the pore opening in the control cardiomyocytes but failed to enhance the effect of morphine on the mPTP opening. In conclusion, morphine mobilizes intracellular Zn(2+) through the NO/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway and prevents the mPTP opening by inactivating GSK-3beta through Zn(2+).

[Studies on the growth of rabbit skin fibroblasts on the surfaces of acellular dermal matrix]. The growth of fibroblasts on the acellular dermal matrix (ADM) was studied. The fibroblasts isolated from the skin of an adult New Zealand Rabbit were cultured in vitro and identified subsequently. After the cells were inoculated on the ADM as seeds, the adhesion rate and the growth ability were examined, and cellular morphology was assayed with DAPI fluorescent staining and Scanning electron microscope (SEM). The possibilities of applying ADM as cells carrier or deliverer in the field of transplantation were evaluated. The result revealed that pure fibroblasts were isolated through the specific method. Skin fibroblasts could adhere to ADM easily, and the adhesion rate was 96.78%, displaying no significant difference (P > 0.05) when compared with that rate of the control holes. The cells on the scaffolds and those on the control holes showed similar growth tendencies, but the activity of the former was lower (P < 0.01). The integral nucleus with blue fluorescence could be observed on the ADM under fluorescence microscope. The number of fibroblasts scaled up with the cultured time, The results of SEM showed that the state of cell was good and the fibroblasts were fused into a layer after being cultured for 5-10d. So rabbit fibroblasts can attach, survive, grow and proliferate on the ADM in a healthy way. It is entirely possible to use ADM as an appropriate scaffold material for the culture of fibroblasts and as a material for transplantations.

Stereo endoscopy as a 3-D measurement tool. Stereoscopic endoscopes restore much of the sense of depth perception lost in minimally invasive surgery techniques. They also open the possibility of anatomical reconstruction from in-vivo video using established computer vision techniques. However, limitations in computational power, as well as imaging constraints due to specularities, color, and movement, make full three-dimensional reconstruction difficult to achieve in real time. We demonstrate that a subset of this reconstruction problem, the ability to take accurate anatomical measurements, can be trivially achieved using current stereo-endoscopes and well-known algorithms. After careful calibration of the camera pair, we track the surgical instruments, which present the strongest features in the operating scene. The three-dimensional positions of the tips of the instruments are automatically calculated in real-time, and the computation of the distance between them allows for accurate measurements of any anatomical region within reach of the instrument tips.

Vestibular disease in dogs and cats. The vestibular system is the major sensory (special proprioceptive) system that, along with the general proprioceptive and visual systems, maintains balance. Clinical signs of vestibular disease include asymmetric ataxia, head tilt, and pathologic nystagmus. Neuroanatomic localization of observed vestibular signs to either the peripheral or central components of the vestibular system is paramount to the management of the patient with vestibular dysfunction, as the etiology, diagnostic approaches, and prognoses are dependent on the neuroanatomic diagnosis. This article reviews functional vestibular neuroanatomy as well as the diagnosis and treatment of common causes of small animal vestibular disease.


An Increased Risk of Second Malignant Neoplasms After Rhabdomyosarcoma: Population-Based Evidence for a Cancer Predisposition Syndrome?

Context-aware life-logging for persons with mild dementia. The demands of introducing technology to support independent living is increasing. This is true also for persons suffering from mild dementia who may have difficulties remembering important information, such as activities, numbers, names, objects, faces, and so on. This paper presents a context-aware life-logging system, called MemoryLane, which can support independent living and improve quality of life for persons with mild dementia. The system offers both real time support as well as possibilities to rehearse and recall activities for building episodic memory. This paper also presents a mobile client to be used in MemoryLane, as well as an evaluation of the importance of different data for the purpose of memory recollection.


Food preferences and Hg distribution in Chelonia mydas assessed by stable isotopes.

Targeted chemotherapy in drug-resistant tumors, noninvasive imaging of P-glycoprotein-mediated functional transport in cancer, and emerging role of Pgp in neurodegenerative diseases. Multidrug resistance (MDR) mediated by overexpression of P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is one of the best characterized transporter-mediated barriers to successful chemotherapy in cancer patients and is also a rapidly emerging target in the progression of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Therefore, strategies capable of delivering chemotherapeutic agents into drug-resistant tumors and targeted radiopharmaceuticals acting as ultrasensitive molecular imaging probes for detecting functional Pgp expression in vivo could be expected to play a vital role in systemic biology as personalized medicine gains momentum in the twenty-first century. While targeted therapy could be expected to deliver optimal doses of chemotherapeutic drugs into the desired targets, the interrogation of Pgp-mediated transport activity in vivo via noninvasive imaging techniques (SPECT and PET) would be beneficial in stratification of patient populations likely to benefit from a given therapeutic treatment, thereby assisting management of drug resistance in cancer and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Both strategies could play a vital role in advancement of personalized treatments in cancer and neurodegenerative diseases. Via this tutorial, authors make an attempt in outlining these strategies and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.

A note on trader Sharpe Ratios. Traders in the financial world are assessed by the amount of money they make and, increasingly, by the amount of money they make per unit of risk taken, a measure known as the Sharpe Ratio. Little is known about the average Sharpe Ratio among traders, but the Efficient Market Hypothesis suggests that traders, like asset managers, should not outperform the broad market. Here we report the findings of a study conducted in the City of London which shows that a population of experienced traders attain Sharpe Ratios significantly higher than the broad market. To explain this anomaly we examine a surrogate marker of prenatal androgen exposure, the second-to-fourth finger length ratio (2D:4D), which has previously been identified as predicting a trader's long term profitability. We find that it predicts the amount of risk taken by traders but not their Sharpe Ratios. We do, however, find that the traders' Sharpe Ratios increase markedly with the number of years they have traded, a result suggesting that learning plays a role in increasing the returns of traders. Our findings present anomalous data for the Efficient Markets Hypothesis.

Redesigning intensive care unit flow using variability management to improve access and safety. Poor flow of patients into and out of the ICU can result in gridlock and bottlenecks that disrupt care and have a detrimental effect on patient safety and satisfaction, hospital efficiency, staff stress and morale, and revenue. Beginning in 2006, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center implemented a series of interventions to "smooth" patient flow through the system. Key activities included patient flow models based on surgical providers' predicted need for intensive care and predicted length of stay; scheduling the case and an ICU bed at the same time; capping and simulation models to identify the appropriate number of elective surgical cases to maximize occupancy without cancelling elective cases; and a morning huddle by the chief of staff, manager of patient services, and representatives from the operating room, pediatric ICUS, and anesthesia to confirm that day's plan and anticipate the next day's needs. New elective surgical admissions to the pediatric ICU were restricted to a maximum of five cases per day. Diversion of patients to the cardiac ICU, keeping patients in the postanesthesia care unit longer than expected, and delaying or canceling cases are now rare events. Since implementation of the operations management interventions, there have been no cases when beds in the pediatric ICU were not available when needed for urgent medical or surgical use. A system for smoothing flow, based on an advanced predictive model for need, occupancy, and length of stay, coupled with an active daily strategy for demand/capacity matching of resources and needs, allowed much better early planning, predictions, and capacity management, thereby ensuring that all patients are in suitable ICU environments.

[The effects of WT1 gene down regulation on the sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to adriamycin]. To investigate the effects of WT1 gene down regulation on the sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to adriamycin (ADM). Short hair RNA (shRNA) plasmid vector targeting WT1 gene with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was transfected into K562/A02 cells. Transfection efficiency was detected and transfected cells were sorted by flow cytometry. Expression of WT1 gene was detected by real time fluorescence RT-PCR and Western blot. The IC50 of ADM on K562/A02 cells was measured by MTT assay. Intracellular ADM accumulation and ADM-induced apoptosis of K562/A02 cells were detected by flow cytometry. 48 h after transfection,the transfection efficiency was (68.2 +/- 4.5)%. Both the mRNA and protein of WT1 were significantly decreased in K562/A02 cells transfected with WT1 shRNA plasmid than in control. After 24 h ADM induction, the relative reverse rate of sensitivity of K562/A02 cells to ADM was 71.5%. The intracellular accumulation of ADM was greatly increased (P<0.05) and ADM-induced apoptosis rate elevated from 10.4% to 67.3% (P<0.05). shRNA targeting WT1 gene can efficiently inhibit the WT1 expression in K562/A02 cells and enhance the drug sensitivity of K562 cells to ADM.

Improved separability of dipole sources by tripolar versus conventional disk electrodes: a modeling study using independent component analysis. Tripolar electrodes have been shown to have less mutual information and higher spatial resolution than disc electrodes. In this work, a four-layer anisotropic concentric spherical head computer model was programmed, then four configurations of time-varying dipole signals were used to generate the scalp surface signals that would be obtained with tripolar and disc electrodes, and four important EEG artifacts were tested: eye blinking, cheek movements, jaw movements, and talking. Finally, a fast fixed-point algorithm was used for signal independent component analysis (ICA). The results show that signals from tripolar electrodes generated better ICA separation results than from disc electrodes for EEG signals with these four types of artifacts.


Autophagy confers DNA damage repair pathways to protect the hematopoietic system from nuclear radiation injury.

Analysis of the connection redundancy in functional networks from high-resolution EEG: a preliminary study. In the present study, we propose a theoretical graph procedure to investigate the communication redundancy in brain networks. By taking into account all the possible paths between pairs of cortical regions, this method captures the network redundancy i.e. a critical resource of the brain enhancing the resilience to neural damages and dysfunctions. As an example for its potential, we apply this procedure to the cortical networks estimated from high-resolution EEG signals in a group of spinal cord injured patients during the attempt of the foot movement. Preliminary results suggest that in the high spectral contents the effects due to the spinal trauma affect the expected redundancy attitude by suppressing mainly the longer alternative pathways between the cortical regions.

Usa1p is required for optimal function and regulation of the Hrd1p endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation ubiquitin ligase. Usa1p is a recently discovered member of the HRD ubiquitin ligase complex. The HRD pathway is a conserved route of ubiquitin-dependent, endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) of numerous lumenal (ERAD-L) and membrane-anchored (ERAD-M) substrates. We have investigated Usa1p to understand its importance in HRD complex action. Usa1p was required for the optimal function of the Hrd1p E3 ubiquitin ligase; its loss caused deficient degradation of both membrane-associated and lumenal proteins. Furthermore, Usa1p functioned in regulation of Hrd1p by two mechanisms. First, Hrd1p self-degradation, which serves to limit the levels of uncomplexed E3, is absolutely dependent on Usa1p and the ubiquitin-like (Ubl) domain of Usa1p. We found that Usa1p allows Hrd1p degradation by promoting trans interactions between Hrd1p molecules. The Ubl domain of Usa1p was required specifically for Hrd1p self-ubiquitination but not for degradation of either ERAD-L or ERAD-M substrates. In addition, Usa1p was able to attenuate the activity-dependent toxicity of Hrd1p without compromising substrate degradation, indicating a separate role in ligase regulation that operates in parallel to stability control. Many of the described actions of Usa1p are distinct from those of Der1p, which is recruited to the HRD complex by Usa1p. Thus, this novel, conserved factor is broadly involved in the function and regulation of the HRD pathway of ERAD.

Hypertonic saline, mannitol and hydroxyethyl starch preconditioning of platelets obtained from septic patients attenuates CD40 ligand expression in vitro. Because platelet CD40 ligand (CD40L) expression plays an important role in inflammatory conditions, reduction of CD40L expression may be beneficial for patients with sepsis. Although hypertonic saline, mannitol, and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) solutions have been shown to modulate inflammatory responses, their effects on platelet CD40L expression are unclear. We assessed the effects of hypertonic saline, mannitol, and HES solutions on platelet CD40L expression. Platelet-rich plasma samples were obtained from septic patients and diluted to 1%, 2.5%, 5%, or 7.5% (vol/vol) with 7.5% saline, 3% saline, 0.9% saline, 20% mannitol, 10% HES (200/0.5), or Ringer's solution. Twenty-five samples were used per dilution. To determine platelet CD40L expression, platelet samples were stimulated with thrombin (0.1 U/mL), incubated with fluorochrome-conjugated platelet antibodies, and analyzed using flow cytometry. Preconditioning of platelet-rich plasma with hypertonic saline, mannitol, and HES attenuated CD40L expression at dilution ratios of 5%, 1%, and 1%, respectively. The decreases were concentration dependent. The effects of mannitol and HES on CD40L expression were almost identical and were superior to those of 3% saline. In contrast, 0.9% saline and Ringer's solution had no effect on CD40L expression. Our data show that resuscitation fluids, such as hypertonic saline, mannitol, and HES, inhibit agonist-induced CD40L expression on platelets. These resuscitation fluids may have an anti-inflammatory action when administered to septic patients.

Quantitative Impact of Plasma Clearance and Down-regulation on GLP-1 Receptor Molecular Imaging. Quantitative molecular imaging of beta cell mass (BCM) would enable early detection and treatment monitoring of type 1 diabetes. The glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor is an attractive target due to its beta cell specificity and cell surface location. We quantitatively investigated the impact of plasma clearance and receptor internalization on targeting efficiency in healthy B6 mice. Four exenatide-based probes were synthesized that varied in molecular weight, binding affinity, and plasma clearance. The GLP-1 receptor internalization rate and in vivo receptor expression were quantified. Receptor internalization (54,000 receptors/cell in vivo) decreased significantly within minutes, reducing the benefit of a slower-clearing agent. The multimers and albumin binding probes had higher kidney and liver uptake, respectively. Slow plasma clearance is beneficial for GLP-1 receptor peptide therapeutics. However, for exendin-based imaging of islets, down-regulation of the GLP-1 receptor and non-specific background uptake result in a higher target-to-background ratio for fast-clearing agents.


Pharyngeal airway volume and shape from cone-beam computed tomography: relationship to facial morphology.

Incidence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis at Chinese PLA General Hospital. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), dermatology, and dermatopathology records were searched to determine the incidence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) at a large military hospital in China. Over the past 3.7 years, gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)-enhanced MRI was performed with Gd-DTPA (n = 28,680) or MultiHance (n = 635) typically at slightly more than a standard dose, as most patients received a unit dose, 15 mL or 20 mL instead of a weight-based dose. This included 118 renal failure patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 30 mL/min and 33 patients on chronic hemodialysis. Despite a diligent search involving rereview of histopathological sections in similarly diagnosed cases, there was no evidence that any patient developed nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. For the renal failure and hemodialysis patients, there were no clinical notes of unexplained rashes within 3 months following GBCA. The incidence of NSF in Chinese People Liberation Army General Hospital using gadolinium (Gd) in 29,315 patients, 151 with severe renal failure or hemodialysis, is thus far undetectable. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2009;30:1309-1312. (c) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

A simple filter circuit for denoising biomechanical impact signals. We present a simple scheme for denoising non-stationary biomechanical signals with the aim of accurately estimating their second derivative (acceleration). The method is based on filtering in fractional Fourier domains using well-known low-pass filters in a way that amounts to a time-varying cut-off threshold. The resulting algorithm is linear and its design is facilitated by the relationship between the fractional Fourier transform and joint time-frequency representations. The implemented filter circuit employs only three low-order filters while its efficiency is further supported by the low computational complexity of the fractional Fourier transform. The results demonstrate that the proposed method can denoise the signals effectively and is more robust against noise as compared to conventional low-pass filters.

Cytokine production from human primary teeth pulp fibroblasts stimulated by different pulpotomy agents. After exposing the pulp tissue, cytokines are produced that regulate the pulp inflammatory response. The dental literature, however, lacks information on the participation of primary tooth fibroblasts in this process. The purpose of this study was to verify the participation of human primary tooth pulp fibroblasts in the inflammatory process, evaluate the production of interleukin 1 beta (IL-l beta) and interleukin 8 (IL-8) from these cells. Pulpotomy agents were applied as conditioned media on cell cultures in the following groups: (1) negative control; (2) positive control (Lipopolysaccharide -LPS); (3) calcium hydroxide (powder); (4) mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA); (5) adhesive resin; and (6) formocresol. After 24 hours in contact with the cells, the conditioned media were removed, the proteins were extracted from the cells and IL-l beta and IL-8 were quantified by ELISA (Enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay). Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (P<0.05) and Tukey's test (P<0.05). It was observed that calcium hydroxide has stimulated the production of IL-l beta, without stimulating IL-8. Conversely, the adhesive resin and formocresol stimulated the production of IL-8, and did not stimulate IL-l beta. MTA stimulated both cytokines in an intermediate level when compared to the other materials. Primary tooth fibroblasts can respond immunologically, and different pulp capping materials can help in this process.

Insurer and out-of-pocket costs of osteoarthritis in the US: evidence from national survey data. Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major debilitating disease affecting approximately 27 million persons in the US. Yet, the financial costs to patients and insurers remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to quantify by multivariate analyses the relationships between OA and annual health care expenditures borne by patients and insurers. Data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) for the years 1996-2005 were used. MEPS is a large, nationally representative US database that includes information on health care expenditures, medical conditions, health insurance status, and sociodemographic characteristics. Individual and nationally aggregated cost estimates are provided. OA was found to contribute substantially to health care expenditures. Among women, OA increased out-of-pocket (OOP) expenditures by $1,379 per annum (2007 dollars) and insurer expenditures by $4,833. Among men, OA increased OOP expenditures by $694 per annum and insurer expenditures by $4,036. Given the high prevalence of OA, the aggregate effects on health care expenditures were very large. OA raised aggregate annual medical care expenditures by $185.5 billion. Of that amount, insurer expenditures were $149.4 billion and OOP expenditures were $36.1 billion. Because of the greater prevalence of OA in women and their more intensive use of health care, total expenditures for this group accounted for $118 billion, or almost two-thirds of the total increase in health care expenditures resulting from OA. The health care cost burden associated with OA is quite large for all groups examined and is disproportionately higher for women. Although insurers bear the brunt of treatment costs for OA, the OOP costs are also substantial.

Injectable myocardial matrix as a scaffold for myocardial tissue engineering. Current injectable materials utilized in myocardial tissue engineering have been borrowed from other tissue engineering applications and have not been specifically designed for the myocardium. We have recently tested the feasibility of using an injectable form of myocardial extracellular matrix that would provide cardiac specific matrix cues as well as be amenable to minimally invasive delivery. We have demonstrated that this material self-assembles in vivo to form a nanofibrous scaffold, which supports the infiltration of neovasculature. We have also demonstrated that this material may be delivered minimally invasively through a catheter.

[Perceptual characteristics of drugs and their potential effects]. In this narrative review the anecdotical, empirical and theoretical knowledge about expectations and effects evoked by perceptual characteristics of pharmaceuticals is summarised within the framework of the so-called non-specific effects. The most important factors (such as prestige, brand, dosage, way of administration, taste, size/shape, colour of curatives) and their impact are discussed in details, based on all available sources in literature. After the summary of the known explanations regarding the origins of expectations and effects (conditioning, social learning, culture), an integrated approach is proposed. When taking an unknown pharmaceutical, people's expectations rely on culturally and socially mediated knowledge and symbolism. These expectations can drastically change later, due to personal experiences with the effects and look-and-feel of a given drug. Possible practical applications (increasing effectivity of medicines, minimizing side effects, improving compliance, preventing confounding) are also proposed as part of a new approach called intelligent medicine designing.

Indirect immunofluorescence test using polyclonal antibodies for the detection of Taylorella equigenitalis. Contagious equine metritis is a horse disease that causes endometrial inflammation due to Taylorella equigenitalis. Since Taylorella asinigenitalis was characterized, genital swab culture has proved to be an insufficient method for distinguishing between the two Taylorella species. Here, we developed an indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) test using polyclonal antibodies. Specificity, sensitivity, and detection limit were assessed using isolated bacteria (55 T. equigenitalis strains, 46 T. asinigenitalis strains and 18 other bacterial species), experimental and genital swabs in comparison to bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. Our results indicated that IIF using polyclonal antibodies allows T. equigenitalis to be discriminated from T. asinigenitalis. This test constitutes a rapid, sensitive and specific tool for confirming presumptive colonies of T. equigenitalis.

Photokilling of bacteria by curcumin in different aqueous preparations. Studies on curcumin and curcuminoids XXXVII. Curcumin has potential as a photosensitiser (PS) in photodynamic therapy (PDT) for localised superficial infections. However, it is a challenge to make an optimal curcumin formulation in which curcumin has acceptable solubility and stability at physiological pH and combined with high selective phototoxic activity towards bacteria. In the present study, the phototoxic effects of curcumin against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were investigated in selected aqueous preparations. The gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus intermedius and the gram-negative Escherichia coli were used as bacterial models. The bacteria were exposed to 1-25 microM curcumin solubilised in DMSO, cyclodextrines, liposomes and surfactants known to interfere with membranes. After 30 min incubation the bacteria were irradiated with fluorescent tubes emitting blue light (emission max 430 nm). The irradiance was 17 mW/cm2 and the radiant exposure (light dose) was 0.5-30J/cm2. The bacterial survival was calculated as a percentage compared to controls. Various post-irradiation incubation times were tested. Curcumin's native fluorescence was exploited in examination of curcumin uptake in or adherence to bacteria by fluorescence microscopy. Changes in post-irradiation incubation time, curcumin concentration, irradiation dose and preparation strongly influenced the phototoxic efficiency of curcumin in vitro. Aqueous preparations of DMSO, polyethyleneglycol and the pluronic block copolymer poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) were the most efficient vehicles for curcumin to exert photokilling of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.

Impact of acute exposure to WTC dust on ciliated and goblet cells in lungs of rats. Clinical studies and the World Trade Center (WTC) Health Registry have revealed increases in the incidence of chronic (non-cancer) lung disorders among first responders (FR) who were at Ground Zero during the initial 72âh after the collapse. Our previous analyses of rats exposed to building-derived WTC dusts using exposure scenarios/levels that mimicked FR mouth-breathing showed that a single WTC dust exposure led to changes in expression of genes whose products could be involved in the lung ailments, but few other significant pathologies. We concluded that rather than acting as direct inducers of many of the FR health effects, it was more likely inhaled WTC dusts instead may have impacted on toxicities induced by other rescue-related co-pollutants present in Ground Zero air. To allow for such effects to occur, we hypothesized that the alkaline WTC dusts induced damage to the normal ability of the lungs to clear inhaled particles. To validate this, rats were exposed on two consecutive days (2âh/d, by intratracheal inhalation) to WTC dust (collected 12-13 September 2001) and examined over a 1-yr period thereafter for changes in the presence of ciliated cells in the airways and hyperplastic goblet cells in the lungs. WTC dust levels in the lungs were assessed in parallel to verify that any changes in levels of these cells corresponded with decreases in host ability to clear the particles themselves. Image analyses of the rat lungs revealed a significant decrease in ciliated cells and increase in hyperplastic goblet cells due to the single series of WTC dust exposures. The study also showed there was only a nominal non-significant decrease (6-11%) in WTC dust burden over a 1-yr period after the final exposure. These results provide support for our current hypothesis that exposure to WTC dusts caused changes in airway morphology/cell composition; such changes could, in turn, have led to potential alterations in the clearance/toxicities of other pollutants inhaled at Ground Zero in the critical initial 72-h period.

Sleep Disorders Reduce Health-Related Quality of Life in Multiple Sclerosis (Nottingham Health Profile Data in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis). Quality of Life (QoL) is decreased in multiple sclerosis (MS), but studies about the impact of sleep disorders (SD) on health-related quality of Life (HRQoL) are lacking. From our original cohort, a cross-sectional polysomnographic (PSG) study in consecutive MS patients, we retrospectively analysed the previously unpublished data of the Nottingham Health Profile (NHP). Those MS patients suffering from sleep disorders (n = 49) showed significantly lower HRQoL compared to MS patients without sleep disorders (n = 17). Subsequently, we classified the patients into four subgroups: insomnia (n = 17), restless-legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder and SD due to leg pain (n = 24), obstructive sleep apnea (n = 8) and patients without sleep disorder (n = 17). OSA and insomnia patients showed significantly higher NHP values and decreased HRQoL not only for the sleep subscale but also for the "energy" and "emotional" area of the NHP. In addition, OSA patients also showed increased NHP values in the "physical abilities" area. Interestingly, we did not find a correlation between the objective PSG parameters and the subjective sleep items of the NHP. However, this study demonstrates that sleep disorders can reduce HRQoL in MS patients and should be considered as an important confounder in all studies investigating HRQoL in MS. 

Designer protein-based scaffolds for neural tissue engineering. A key attribute missing from many current biomaterials is the ability to independently tune multiple biomaterial properties without simultaneously affecting other material parameters. Because cells are well known to respond to changes in the initial elastic modulus, degradation rate, and cell adhesivity of a biomaterial, it is critical to develop synthetic design strategies that allow decoupled tailoring of each individual parameter in order to systematically optimize cell-scaffold interactions. We present the development of a family of biomimetic scaffolds composed of chemically crosslinked, elastin-like proteins designed to support neural regeneration through a combination of cell adhesion and cell-induced degradation and remodeling. Through use of a modular protein-design strategy, a range of biomaterials is created that allows independent tuning over the initial elastic modulus, degradation rate, cell adhesivity, and neurite outgrowth. By combining these engineered proteins into composite structures, biomaterials are created with 3D patterns that emerge over time in response to cell-secreted enzymes. These dynamic 3D structures enable the delivery of multiple drugs with precise spatial and temporal resolution and also enable the design of biomaterials that adapt to changing scaffold needs.

Deficiency of pulmonary Valpha24 Vbeta11 natural killer T cells in corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve sarcoidosis patients. Invariant natural killer T (NKT) cells might contribute to the amplified and prolonged T-cell immune response that characterizes sarcoidosis. Therefore, we want to investigate the frequency and distribution of pulmonary invariant NKT cells in corticosteroid-naÃ¯ve patients with sarcoidosis. We used multi-parameter flow cytometry with antibodies against CD3, CD4, CD8, CD14, CD19, CD45, CD16/56, TCR Valpha24, and TCR Vbeta11, on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), to examine the frequency and distribution of pulmonary invariant NKT cells in 47 newly diagnosed sarcoidosis patients and in 8 control subjects. The frequencies of BALF Valpha24 Vbeta11 invariant NKT cells were significantly lower in patients with sarcoidosis in comparison to control subjects. Moreover, lower invariant NKT cell frequencies in patients with sarcoidosis significantly correlated with exaggerated BALF lymphocytosis and CD4 T cell responses. This study demonstrated a pulmonary deficiency in the frequency of a subset of T cells with immunoregulatory function in patients with sarcoidosis.


Vinculin and talin: focus on the myocardium.

Mental workload classification using heart rate metrics. The ability of different short-term heart rate variability metrics to classify the level of mental workload (MWL) in 140 s segments was studied. Electrocardiographic data and event related potentials (ERPs), calculated from electroencephalographic data, were collected from 13 healthy subjects during the performance of a computerised cognitive multitask test with different task load levels. The amplitude of the P300 component of the ERPs was used as an objective measure of MWL. Receiver operating characteristics analysis (ROC) showed that the time domain metric of average interbeat interval length was the best-performing metric in terms of classification ability.

Isotope Fractionation Associated with the Photochemical Dechlorination of Chloroanilines. Isotope fractionation associated with the photochemical transformation of organic contaminants is not well understood and can arise not only from bond cleavage reactions but also from photophysical processes. In this work, we investigated the photolytic dechlorination of 2-Cl- and 3-Cl-aniline to aminophenols to obtain insights into the impact of the substituent position on the apparent (13)C and (15)N kinetic isotope effects (AKIEs). Laboratory experiments were performed in aerated aqueous solutions at an irradiation wavelength of 254 nm over the pH range 2.0 to 7.0 in the absence and presence of Cs(+) used as an excited singlet state quencher. Photolysis of 2-Cl-anilinium cations exhibits normal C and inverse N isotope fractionation, while neutral 2-Cl-aniline species shows inverse C and normal N isotope fractionation. In contrast, the photolysis of 3-Cl-aniline was almost insensitive to C isotope composition and the moderate N isotope fractionation points to rate-limiting photophysical processes. (13)C- and (15)N-AKIE-values of 2-Cl-aniline decreased in the presence of Cs(+), whereas those for 3-Cl-aniline were not systematically affected by Cs(+). Our current and previous work illustrates that photolytic dechlorinations of 2-Cl-, 3-Cl-, and 4-Cl-aniline isomers are each accompanied by distinctly different and highly variable C and N isotope fractionation due to spin selective isotope effects.

Habitat Heterogeneity Affects Plant and Arthropod Species Diversity and Turnover in Traditional Cornfields. The expansion of the agricultural frontier by the clearing of remnant forests has led to human-dominated landscape mosaics. Previous studies have evaluated the effect of these landscape mosaics on arthropod diversity at local spatial scales in temperate and tropical regions, but little is known about fragmentation effects in crop systems, such as the complex tropical traditional crop systems that maintain a high diversity of weeds and arthropods in low-Andean regions. To understand the factors that influence patterns of diversity in human-dominated landscapes, we investigate the effect of land use types on plant and arthropod diversity in traditionally managed cornfields, via surveys of plants and arthropods in twelve traditional cornfields in the Colombian Andes. We estimated alpha and beta diversity to analyze changes in diversity related to land uses within a radius of 100 m to 1 km around each cornfield. We observed that forests influenced alpha diversity of plants, but not of arthropods. Agricultural lands had a positive relationship with plants and herbivores, but a negative relationship with predators. Pastures positively influenced the diversity of plants and arthropods. In addition, forest cover seemed to influence changes in plant species composition and species turnover of herbivore communities among cornfields. The dominant plant species varied among fields, resulting in high differentiation of plant communities. Predator communities also exhibited high turnover among cornfields, but differences in composition arose mainly among rare species. The crop system evaluated in this study represents a widespread situation in the tropics, therefore, our results can be of broad significance. Our findings suggest that traditional agriculture may not homogenize biological communities, but instead could maintain the regional pool of species through high beta diversity.

The natural history of patients treated for TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome. Patients with Saethre-Chotzen syndrome have a heterogeneous phenotype. The purpose of this study was to use the genotypic diagnosis of the authors' series of patients with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome to describe their natural history and long-term surgical outcomes. A retrospective chart review was performed on patients treated at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome (n = 22) over 23 years (1985 to 2008). Their phenotype, need for primary cranial vault remodeling surgery, and subsequent need for reoperation were recorded. Genetic records were reviewed to identify each patient's TWIST1 mutation. There were nine female patients and 13 male patients. Ten had bicoronal (45 percent), six had unicoronal (27 percent), and four had multisuture (18 percent) craniosynostosis. One had metopic and another had sagittal craniosynostosis. Average follow-up was 7.6 years (range, birth to 19.6 years). Seventeen (77 percent) underwent initial cranial vault remodeling and 10 (59 percent) required repeat intracranial vault remodeling (Whitaker class IV). One patient required major reoperation with bone grafting (Whitaker class III). Three patients needed minor revision procedures (Whitaker class II). Three patients needed no further intervention (Whitaker class I). The locations of the TWIST1 gene mutations in this study did not correlate to a specific surgical outcome. TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome is heterogeneous and manifests as either mild or severe craniofacial deformities. Our patients with TWIST1-confirmed Saethre-Chotzen syndrome had a reoperation rate of 65 percent for Whitaker class III and IV surgical outcome, and 59 percent required a secondary intracranial procedure for recurrent supraorbital retrusion.

[Genotypic homogeneity and susceptibility to clarithromycin for clarithromycin-resistant Helicobacter pylori strains]. To investigate the mixed infection of clarithromycin susceptibility and genotype of Helicobacter pylori resistant strains. Ten single colonies were picked randomly from each of 16 resistant strains. Genomic DNA was prepared from single colony isolates and their parental clarithromycin-resistant strains by the hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)-phenol extraction method. Susceptibilities of single colony isolates to clarithromycin were determined by agar dilution and mutations in clarithromycin-resistant isolates identified by polymerase chain reaction and restrictions analysis. Genotypes of 16 resistant strains and their single colony isolates were tested by the fingerprinting patterns of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). All single colony isolates derived from 16 resistant strains were also resistant to clarithromycin and had the A2143G point mutation in 23 S rRNA gene. The RAPD fingerprints of single colony isolates derived from the same patient were identical to each other and to the RAPD fingerprint of the corresponding parental isolate. Neither mixed susceptibility nor mixed genotype was found in clarithromycin resistant strains.

Pathways to suicide attempts among male offenders: the role of agency. Suicide is common among offenders, who are at increased risk of homelessness, unemployment and mental illness and are prone to impulsivity. Release from prison is a particularly vulnerable time. This qualitative study investigated the views of 35 offenders in South-West England prior to and after release from prison, enquiring into their previous suicide attempts and how they saw their future. Semi-structured interviews were analysed thematically, comparing individuals who had made one, more than one, and no suicide attempts. Multiple attempters were often in despair and enmeshed in substance misuse, with little control over their lives. Most of those with one-off or no previous attempts portrayed themselves as having more mastery. One-off attempters described using particularly violent means. The role of different types of agency in pathways to and from suicide is discussed. Iterational agency, the selective reactivation of past patterns of behaviour, appeared to dominate in individuals who were choosing between further suicide attempts and substance use. Projective agency, having a more future orientation, appeared more prominent in some single attempters and in those individuals with plans to escape crime and social exclusion. 


Use of epoetin beta during combination therapy of infection with hepatitis c virus with ribavirin improves a sustained viral response.

Cell-cycle times and the tumour control probability. Mechanistic dynamic cell population models for the tumour control probability (TCP) to date have used a simplistic representation of the cell cycle: either an exponential cell-cycle time distribution (Zaider & Minerbo, 2000, Tumour control probability: a formulation applicable to any temporal protocol of dose delivery. Phys. Med. Biol., 45, 279-293) or a two-compartment model (Dawson & Hillen, 2006, Derivation of the tumour control probability (TCP) from a cell cycle model. Comput. Math. Methods Med., 7, 121-142; Hillen, de Vries, Gong & Yurtseven, 2009, From cell population models to tumour control probability: including cell cycle effects. Acta Oncol. (submitted)). Neither of these simplifications captures realistic cell-cycle time distributions, which are rather narrowly peaked around the mean. We investigate how including such distributions affects predictions of the TCP. At first, we revisit the so-called 'active-quiescent' model that splits the cell cycle into two compartments and explore how an assumption of compartmental independence influences the predicted TCP. Then, we formulate a deterministic age-structured model and a corresponding branching process. We find that under realistic cell-cycle time distributions, lower treatment intensities are sufficient to obtain the same TCP as in the aforementioned models with simplified cell cycles, as long as the treatment is constant in time. For fractionated treatment, the situation reverses such that under realistic cell-cycle time distributions, the model requires more intense treatment to obtain the same TCP.


Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma: a case report with distinct radiological features.

Alternative splicing attenuates transgenic expression directed by the apolipoprotein E promoter-enhancer based expression vector pLIV11. The plasmid vector pLIV11 is used commonly to achieve liver-specific expression of genes of interest in transgenic mice and rabbits. Expression is driven by the human apolipoprotein (apo)E 5' proximal promoter, which includes 5 kb of upstream sequence, exon 1, intron 1, and 5 bp of exon 2. A 3.8 kb 3' hepatic control region, derived from a region approximately 18 kb downstream of the apoE gene, enhances liver-specific expression. Here, we report that cDNA sequences inserted into the multiple cloning site (MCS) of pLIV11, which is positioned just downstream of truncated exon 2, can cause exon 2 skipping. Hence, splicing is displaced to downstream cryptic 3' splice acceptor sites causing deletion of cloned 5' untranslated mRNA sequences and, in some cases, deletion of the 5' end of an open reading frame. To prevent use of cryptic splice sites, the pLIV11 vector was modified with an engineered 3' splice acceptor site inserted immediately downstream of truncated apoE exon 2. Presence of this sequence fully shifted splicing of exon 1 from the native intron 1-exon 2 splice acceptor site to the engineered site. This finding confirmed that sequences inserted into the MCS of the vector pLIV11 can affect exon 2 recognition and provides a strategy to protect cloned sequences from alternative splicing and possible attenuation of transgenic expression.

Inverse regulation of bridging integrator 1 and BCR-ABL1 in chronic myeloid leukemia. Endocytosis is the major regulator process of tyrosine kinase receptor (RTK) functional activities. Bridging integrator 1 (BIN1) is a key protein involved in RTK intracellular trafficking. Here, we report, by studying 34 patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) at diagnosis, that BIN1 gene is downregulated in CML as compared to healthy controls, suggesting an altered endocytosis of RTKs. Rab interactor 1 (RIN1), an activator of BIN1, displayed a similar behavior. Treatment of 57 patients by tyrosine kinase inhibitors caused, along with BCR-ABL1 inactivation, an increase of BIN1 and RIN1 expression, potentially restoring endocytosis. There was a significant inverse correlation between BIN1-RIN1 and BCR-ABL1 expression. In vitro experiments on both CML and nontumorigenic cell lines treated with Imatinib confirmed these results. In order to provide another proof in favor of BIN1 and RIN1 endocytosis function in CML, we demonstrated that Imatinib induced, in K562 cell line, BIN1-RIN1 upregulation accompanied by a parallel AXL receptor internalization into cytoplasmic compartment. This study shows a novel deregulated mechanism in CML patients, indicating BIN1 and RIN1 as players in the maintenance of the abnormal RTK signaling in this hematological disease.

Labdane-type diterpenes from Hedychium gardnerianum with potent cytotoxicity against human small cell lung cancer cells. Seven labdane-type diterpenes, coronarin E, coronarin A, yunnancoronarin A, yunnancoronarin B, hedyforrestin B, villosin, and hedyforrestin C were isolated from the rhizome of Hedychium gardnerianum and evaluated for cytotoxic activity against human small cell lung cancer (NCI-H187) and non-cancerous Vero cells. The results showed that villosin exhibited potent cytotoxic activity with IC(50) of 0.40 microM, which was higher than that of the drug ellipticine (IC(50) 1.79 microM). Moreover, ellipticine was very toxic to Vero cells (IC(50) 7.47 microM) whereas the toxicity of villosin was undetectable at concentration lower than 166.42 microM. The results have indicated that the lactone ring is essential for high cytotoxic activity and that the presence of a hydroxyl group at the 6 or 7 position causes decrease in activity. The very high cytotoxicity against the NCI-H187 cells and the exceptionally high selectivity index (>416) of villosin suggested that this compound may be used as a potential lead molecule for antitumor therapeutic development.

Spatial and phylogenetic analysis of vesicular stomatitis virus over-wintering in the United States. From 2004 through 2006, 751 vesicular stomatitis (VS) outbreaks caused by vesicular stomatitis virus serotype New Jersey (VSNJV) were reported in nine states of the southwestern United States. The normal model of the spatial scan statistic and phylogenetic techniques were used to assess whether the spatial and genetic relations among VSNJV outbreaks were consistent with the hypothesis that VSNJV over-wintered in specific regions of the southwestern United States infected in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Use of the spatial scan statistic led to the identification of two clusters of outbreaks for which the Euclidean distance to the nearest outbreak reported in the previous or following year, whichever was shorter, was significantly (P<0.01) shorter than the epidemic's (2004-2006) mean. Clusters were centered at Colorado and Wyoming and included 375 and 21 outbreaks, respectively. Results were supported by the phylogenetic analysis of 49 VSV samples collected from 2004 through 2006 in the United States and 10 VSV samples originated from Mexico. These findings, which were displayed using a publicly accessible web-based system referred to as the FMD BioPortal, were consistent with over-wintering of specific sub-lineages of VSNJV in a limited geographical region of the United States affected by a VS epidemic in 2005 and 2006.

Cost-utility of minimally invasive versus open transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion: systematic review and economic evaluation. To assess the cost-utility and perioperative costs of minimally invasive transforaminal lumbar interbody fusion (MI-TLIF) versus open-TLIF for degenerative lumbar pathologies. Relevant articles were identified from six electronic databases. Predefined end points were extracted and meta-analysis conducted from the identified studies. For each study, the direct hospital cost for MI-TLIF was found to be less than that of open-TLIF. When these outcomes were pooled, direct hospital costs were found to be significantly lower in the MI-TLIF group [weighted mean difference (WMD), -$2820; I (2) = 61 %; P < 0.00001]. MI-TLIF was also associated with shorter hospitalization (WMD, 0.99; 95 % CI -1.81, -0.17; I (2) = 96 %; P = 0.02), trend toward reduced complications (relative risk 0.53; 95 % CI 0.23, 1.06; I (2) = 0 %; P = 0.07), and reduced blood loss (WMD, -246.40 mL; I (2) = 98 %; P = 0.003), but was not associated with a significant difference in operation time (WMD, -67.05; 95 % CI -169.44, 35.35; I (2) = 100 %; P = 0.20). From the limited evidence, the available data suggest a trend of significantly reduced perioperative costs, length of stay, and blood loss for minimally invasive compared with open surgical approaches for TLIF. MI-TLIF may represent an opportunity for optimal utilization and allocation of health-care resources from both a hospital and societal perspective.


[A case report on methadone withdrawal syndrome].

Seroprevalences to viral pathogens in free-ranging and captive cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus) on Namibian Farmland. Cheetah populations are diminishing rapidly in their natural habitat. One reason for their decline is thought to be a high susceptibility to (infectious) diseases because cheetahs in zoos suffer from high disease-induced mortality. Data on the health status of free-ranging cheetahs are scarce, and little is known about their exposure and susceptibility to infectious diseases. We determined seroprevalences to nine key viruses (feline herpesvirus 1, feline calicivirus, feline parvovirus, feline coronavirus, canine distemper virus, feline immunodeficiency virus [FIV], puma lentivirus, feline leukemia virus, and rabies virus) in 68 free-ranging cheetahs on east-central Namibian farmland, 24 nonvaccinated Namibian captive cheetahs, and several other wild carnivore species and conducted necropsies of cheetahs and other wild carnivores. Eight of 11 other wild carnivores were seropositive for at least one of the viruses, including the first record of an FIV-like infection in a wild felid west of the Kalahari, the caracal (Felis caracal). Seroprevalences of the free-ranging cheetahs were below 5% for all nine viruses, which is significantly lower than seroprevalences in nonvaccinated captive cheetahs and those for five of seven viruses in previously studied free-ranging cheetahs from north-central Namibia (L. Munson, L. Marker, E. Dubovi, J. A. Spencer, J. F. Evermann, and S. J. O'Brien, J. Wildl. Dis. 40:23-31, 2004). There was no clinical or pathological evidence of infectious diseases in living or dead cheetahs. The results suggest that while free-ranging wild carnivores may be a source of pathogens, the distribution of seroprevalences across studies mirrored local human population density and factors associated with human habitation, probably reflecting contact opportunities with (nonvaccinated) domestic and feral cats and dogs. They also suggest that Namibian cheetahs respond effectively to viral challenges, encouraging consistent and sustainable conservation efforts.

A crystal structure of the bifunctional antibiotic simocyclinone D8, bound to DNA gyrase. Simocyclinones are bifunctional antibiotics that inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase by preventing DNA binding to the enzyme. We report the crystal structure of the complex formed between the N-terminal domain of the Escherichia coli gyrase A subunit and simocyclinone D8, revealing two binding pockets that separately accommodate the aminocoumarin and polyketide moieties of the antibiotic. These are close to, but distinct from, the quinolone-binding site, consistent with our observations that several mutations in this region confer resistance to both agents. Biochemical studies show that the individual moieties of simocyclinone D8 are comparatively weak inhibitors of gyrase relative to the parent compound, but their combination generates a more potent inhibitor. Our results should facilitate the design of drug molecules that target these unexploited binding pockets.

Treatment of congenital tracheal stenosis. Congenital tracheal surgery is uncommon and few centers have enough experience to make meaningful conclusions about treatment. Short-segment congenital tracheal stenosis is treated by tracheal resection, whereas long-segment stenosis is treated by slide tracheoplasty. Tracheomalacia is treated most commonly by aortopexy if due to simple vascular compression, division of an offending vascular ring if due to a compressing or encircling ring, or by careful observation if not associated with vascular compression.

Rapid method for extracting the antibiotic mutacin 1140 from complex fermentation medium yeast extract. The peptide antibiotic mutacin 1140 belongs to the group of antibiotics called lantibiotics. They are ribosomally synthesized and undergo extensive enzymatic modifications before being excreted into the culture medium. By using reverse-phase-high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) and a semiquantitative bacteriocin bioassay to track mutacin 1140, an efficient ammonium sulfate (AS) precipitation method has been developed for removing mutacin 1140 from a complex medium containing 5% yeast extract. This method minimizes the amounts of fermentation by-products and media components that make downstream purification processes more difficult and economically infeasible. The method may be adaptable for the initial purification step of other lantibiotics. A threefold decrease in the precipitation of the medium components found in yeast extract, at pH 8.0 vs. pH 2.0, may have broad utility for the isolation of secondary metabolites produced in this complex medium. The average yield of mutacin 1140 from the fermentation medium was determined as 66%.

Aminothiol receptors for decorporation of intravenously administered (60)Co in the rat.

Monocarboxylate transporter-mediated transport of gamma-hydroxybutyric acid in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. The objectives of this study were to determine mRNA expression of monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) and to evaluate intestinal transport of the MCT substrates gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and d-lactate in human intestinal Caco-2 cells. The presence of mRNA for MCT1, 2, 3, and 4 was observed in Caco-2 cells. The uptake of both GHB and d-lactate in Caco-2 cells was demonstrated to be pH- and concentration-dependent and sodium-independent. The uptake of GHB and d-lactate was best described by a Michaelis-Menten equation with passive diffusion (GHB: K(m) = 17.6 +/- 10.5 mM, V(max) = 17.3 +/- 11.7 nmol/min/mg, and P = 0.38 +/- 0.15 microl/min/mg; and d-lactate: K(m) = 6.0 +/- 2.9 mM, V(max) = 35.0 +/- 18.4 nmol/min/mg, and P = 1.3 +/- 0.6 microl/min/mg). The uptake of GHB and d-lactate was significantly decreased by the known MCT inhibitor alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate and the MCT substrates GHB and d-lactate but not by the organic cation tetraethylammonium chloride. Directional flux studies with both GHB and d-lactate suggested the involvement of carrier-mediated transport with the permeability in the apical to basolateral direction higher than that in the basolateral to apical direction. These findings confirm the presence of MCT1-4 in Caco-2 cells and demonstrate GHB and d-lactate transport characteristics consistent with proton-dependent MCT-mediated transport.

Development of a beta-trace protein based formula for estimation of glomerular filtration rate. Beta-trace protein (BTP) is a novel marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). To date, no pediatric formula for calculating GFR based on BTP has been developed. We measured GFR, serum creatinine and BTP in 387 children who underwent 474 (99m)Tc-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid renal scans. A BTP-based formula for estimating GFR was derived using stepwise linear regression analysis. A separate control group of 116 measurements in 99 children was used to validate the novel formula. A formula was also developed for each gender. The novel formula is: [formula: see text]. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient between the BTP-derived GFR estimate and the measured GFR was 0.80 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.76-0.83], which is substantially better than that derived with the Schwartz formula (r = 0.70, 95% CI 0.65-0.74). The Bland-Altman analysis revealed a mean bias of 1.21% [standard deviation (SD) 28%] in the formula development dataset, which was virtually identical to the 1.03% mean bias (29.5% SD) in the validation group and no different from the Schwartz formula bias. The percentage of values within 10% (33.0 vs. 28.3%) and 30% deviation (76.8 vs. 72.6%) were better for BTP-based formula than for the Schwartz formula. Separate formulas according to gender did not perform better than that for the pediatric population. This BTP-based formula was found to estimate GFR with reasonable precision and provided improved accuracy over the Schwartz GFR formula.

Complement and macrophage crosstalk during process of angiogenesis in tumor progression. The complement system, which contains some of the most potent pro-inflammatory mediators in the tissue including the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a are the vital parts of innate immunity. Complement activation seems to play a more critical role in tumor development, but little attention has been given to the angiogenic balance of the activated complement mediators and macrophage polarization during tumor progression. The tumor growth mainly supported by the infiltration of M2- tumor-associated macrophages, and high levels of C3a and C5a, whereas M1-macrophages contribute to immune-mediated tumor suppression. Macrophages express a cognate receptors for both C3a and C5a on their cell surface, and specific binding of C3a and C5a affects the functional modulation and angiogenic properties. Activation of complement mediators induce angiogenesis, favors an immunosuppressive microenvironment, and activate cancer-associated signaling pathways to assist chronic inflammation. In this review manuscript, we highlighted the specific roles of complement activation and macrophage polarization during uncontrolled angiogenesis in tumor progression, and therefore blocking of complement mediators would be an alternative therapeutic option for treating cancer.

Silibinin and related compounds are direct inhibitors of hepatitis C virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Silymarin is a mixture of flavonolignans extracted from the milk thistle. Silymarin contains several molecules, including silibinin A, silibinin B, isosilibinin A, isosilibinin B, silicristin, and silidianin. Intravenous infusion of silibinin induces dose-dependent reduction of hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA levels. The aim of this study was to test the principal isomers contained in silymarin preparations for their ability to inhibit HCV enzymatic functions and replication in different models. The inhibitory activity of silymarin components was tested in HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and NS3/4A protease enzyme assays. Their ability to inhibit replication of an HCV genotype 1b replicon model and the JFH1 infectious HCV model in cell culture was also studied. Silibinin A, silibinin B, their water-soluble dihydrogen succinate forms and Legalon SIL, a commercially available intravenous preparation of silibinin, inhibited HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase function, with inhibitory concentrations 50% of the order of 75-100 microM. Silibinin A and silibinin B also inhibited HCV genotype 1b replicon replication and HCV genotype 2a strain JFH1 replication in cell culture. None of these compounds inhibited HCV protease function. Silibinin A and silibinin B, as well as Legalon SIL, inhibit HCV replicon and JFH1 replication in cell culture. This effect is at least partly explained by the ability of these compounds to inhibit HCV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. Our results provide a basis for the optimization and subsequent development of members of the Flavonoid family as specific HCV antivirals.

Can the Catholic Church agree to condom use by HIV-discordant couples? Does the position of the Roman Catholic Church on contraception also imply that the usage of condoms by HIV-discordant couples is illicit? A standard argument is to appeal to the doctrine of double effect to condone such usage, but this meets with the objection that there exists an alternative action that brings about the good effect-namely, abstinence. I argue against this objection, because an HIV-discordant couple does not bring about any bad outcome through condom usage-there is no disrespect displayed for the generative function of sex. One might retort that the badness of condom usage consists in thwarting the unitive function of sex. I argue that also this objection cannot be upheld. In conclusion, if there are no in-principle objections against condom usage for HIV-discordant couples, then policies that deny access to condoms to such couples are indefensible. HIV-discordant couples have a right to continue consummating their marriage in a manner that is minimally risky and this right cannot be trumped by utilitarian concerns that the distribution of condoms might increase promiscuity and along with it the HIV infection rate.


[Effect of indomethacin on BCR/ABL-Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway in K562 cells].

Clinical features of CIS of the brainstem/cerebellum of the kind seen in MS. Recognition of multiple sclerosis (MS) attacks relies mostly on clinical assessment. However, their definition based on McDonald criteria refers mostly to timing and when dealing with clinical features is rather ambiguous: "...of the kind seen in multiple sclerosis." This is heightened in clinically isolated syndromes of the brainstem/cerebellum (CISB), where clinical manifestations can be manifold. This study aimed to describe the clinical features of patients with CISB to improve clinical recognition of patients with brainstem manifestations at the onset of their MS. To this end, we conducted a retrospective analysis of case notes of consecutively recruited patients with CISB assessed within 3 months of symptoms onset. Seventy-five patients were included. Most common brainstem-specific symptoms were: diplopia (68%), facial sensory symptoms (32%) and gait disturbance (31%). Adjusting for follow-up times, total number of symptoms and presence of other brainstem-specific symptoms, only the presence of facial sensory symptoms was predictive of (a lower risk of) conversion to clinically definite (CD) MS (Odds ratio: 0.086; p = 0.007). Neither the total number of brainstem-specific, non brainstem-specific nor the sum of both predicted conversion to CDMS. Results indicate that diplopia, facial sensory symptoms and gait disturbance occur in more than 30% of patients with CISB. Facial sensory symptoms are less associated with conversion to CDMS.


CILAIR-Based Secretome Analysis of Obese Visceral and Subcutaneous Adipose Tissues Reveals Distinctive ECM Remodeling and Inflammation Mediators.

Acute pulmonary reperfusion hemorrhage: a rare complication after oversized percutaneous balloon valvuloplasty for pulmonary valve stenosis. Balloon valvuloplasty became the treatment of choice for valvular pulmonary stenosis following its first description in 1982 by Kan et al, and has almost replaced surgical pulmonary valvotomy in the present day. It is a safe and effective method for children for relief of right ventricular obstruction. The results of the procedure are excellent, without significant complications. This report describes the case of a 12-year-old boy who received successful balloon valvuloplasty for critical pulmonary valve stenosis complicated by an episode of acute pulmonary hemorrhage. Because of cyanosis, hypotension and bradycardia, he received emergent endotracheal intubation with 100% oxygen supplement and the highest infusion rate of inotropic agents. Venoarterial mode extracorporeal membrane oxygenation was indicated for life support due to the persistent high oxygenation index. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation played a key role in the survival of this patient during the course of treatment.

Trimetazidine and N-acetylcysteine in attenuating hind-limb ischemia and reperfusion injuries: experimental study in rats. Lower-limb traumatic injury associated with ischemia and followed by reperfusion (I/R) is a common severe situation in muscle lesions due to trauma and hypoxia followed by local and systemic injuries induced by oxygen-derived free radical release during reperfusion. The aim of this study was to evaluate the attenuating effects of trimetazidine (TMZ) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in such situation. The muscles at the root of the right hind limb of Wistar rats were cross-sectioned, preserving femoral vessels and nerves and clamping the femoral artery for four hours. The clamp was then released and the femoral artery has been reperfused for 2 hours. Rats were randomly divided in groups of ten as follows: Group 1: sham I/R, treated with saline; Group 2: I/R, treated with saline; Group 3: sham I/R, treated with TMZ (7.5 mg/kg/dose); Group 4: sham I/R, treated with NAC (375 mg/kg/dose); Group 5: I/R treated with TMZ (7.5 mg/kg/dose); Group 6: I/R treated with NAC (375 mg/kg/dose). All rats received two intravenous bolus injections of the drugs, one before ischemia and one before reperfusion. Oxidative stress in plasma (MDA, total, oxidized and reduced glutathione), creatinephosphokinase (CPK), optical and electron microscopy and pelvic extremity circumference and volume were studied. No statistical differences were found between the groups for MDA or total and reduced glutathione. Oxidized glutathione increased significantly in groups 5 and 2. Limb circumference as well as limb volume increased in all groups over time, mainly in groups 5, 2 and 1. CPK increased in all groups, being highest in groups 5, 6 and 2. Histological lesions were present in all but sham groups, being less severe in group 6. Soleus muscle analyses at electron microscopy exhibit some degree of alteration in all groups. This experimental model simulated severe limb trauma associated with ischemia and reperfusion, and, as such, it was aggressive, causing severe injury and local inflammatory reaction. The model did not show antioxidant action from NAC, and possible antioxidant action from TMZ was insufficient to attenuate tissue injuries.

Influence of biopsy specimen size, tissue fixation, and assay variation on copper, iron, and zinc concentrations in canine livers. OBJECTIVE-To determine whether metal concentrations in canine liver specimens were influenced by specimen size, assay variability, tissue processing (formalin fixation and deparaffinization), or storage in paraffin blocks. SAMPLE POPULATION-Liver specimens (fresh frozen and deparaffinized) from 2 dogs with chronic hepatitis (high copper but unremarkable iron concentration [liver 1] and unremarkable copper but high iron concentration [liver 2]) as well as fresh and deparaffinized-archived liver specimens from 20 dogs with various hepatopathies. PROCEDURES-Fresh frozen liver specimens (obtained via simulated needle-core and wedge biopsy), fresh hepatic tissue, and deparaffinized-archived specimens (0.5 to 14 years old) were analyzed for concentrations of copper, iron, and zinc by atomic absorption flame spectrometry. Clinical severity scores were assigned on the basis of tissue metal concentrations. RESULTS-Interassay variation of metal standards was < 4%. Measurements of liver tissues on 8 consecutive days yielded high coefficients of variation (3.6% to 50%) reflecting heterogenous histologic metal distribution; variation was highest in liver 1 and deparaffinized-archived tissues. Heterogenous metal distribution was confirmed by histologic evaluation. The largest range of metal concentrations was detected in wedge biopsy specimens. In tissues with high metal concentrations, copper and iron concentrations were significantly lower in needle-core versus wedge biopsy specimens. A higher zinc concentration in deparaffinized-archived specimens masked a low zinc concentration in fresh liver tissue of 10 of 20 (50%) dogs. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE-Retrospective measurement of copper and iron concentrations but not zinc concentrations in deparaffinized-archived liver specimens provided relevant information. The value of needle-core biopsy specimens for measurement of metal concentrations is questionable.

Effects of an 8-Week Outdoor Brisk Walking Program on Fatigue in Hi-Tech Industry Employees: A Randomized Control Trial. Over 73% of hi-tech industry employees in Taiwan lack regular exercise. They are exposed to a highly variable and stressful work environment for extended periods of time, and may subsequently experience depression, detrimental to workers' physiological and mental health. In this cross-sectional survey, the authors explored the effect of an 8-week brisk walking program on the fatigue of employees in the hi-tech industry. The participants, from a hi-tech company in northern Taiwan, were randomly assigned to an experimental group (EG; 41 subjects, Mage = 33.34 Â± 6.40) or control group (CG; 45 subjects, Mage = 29.40 Â± 3.60). Following the 8-week brisk walking program, the EG showed significantly lower scores for subjective fatigue, working motivation, attention, and overall fatigue. The authors confirmed that the 8-week outdoor brisk walking program significantly improved the level of fatigue among employees of the hi-tech industry. The finding serves as an important reference for health authorities in Taiwan and provides awareness of workplace health promotion in the hi-tech industry.

Leucine modulates contraction- and insulin-stimulated glucose transport and upstream signaling events in rat skeletal muscle. Leucine has profound effects on glucose metabolism in muscle; however, the effects of leucine on glucose transport in muscle have not been well documented. We investigated the effects of leucine on contraction- and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in isolated rat epitrochlearis muscle in vitro. In the absence of insulin, tetanic contraction increased 3-O-methyl-D-glucose (3-MG) transport and Thr(172) phosphorylation of the catalytic alpha-subunit of 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a signaling intermediary leading to insulin-independent glucose transport. Leucine (2 mM, 30 min) significantly enhanced contraction-stimulated 3-MG transport and AMPK phosphorylation, accompanied by increased phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase (p70S6K) Thr(389). The stimulatory effects of leucine on 3-MG transport and AMPK phosphorylation were canceled by STO-609 blockade of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase (CaMKK) or rapamycin blockade of p70S6K. On the other hand, leucine blunted insulin-stimulated 3-MG transport and reduced insulin-stimulated Akt Thr(473) phosphorylation. Leucine increased insulin-stimulated p70S6K Thr(389) phosphorylation and enhanced the inhibitory phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) Ser(636/639). Furthermore, the effects of leucine on insulin-stimulated 3-MG transport and IRS phosphorylation were abolished by rapamycin. These results indicate that leucine activates contraction-stimulated glucose transport and inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose transport in skeletal muscle by activating mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70S6K signaling. Enhanced increases in contraction-stimulated AMPK Thr(172) phosphorylation and insulin-stimulated IRS1 Ser(636/639) phosphorylation might be responsible for these opposing effects of leucine, respectively.

Sixteen weeks of resistance training decrease plasma heat shock protein 72 (eHSP72) and increase muscle mass without affecting high sensitivity inflammatory markers' levels in sarcopenic men. Sarcopenia has been associated with increased systemic inflammation and risk of physical disability in older adults. Recently, extracellular heat shock protein 72 (eHSP72) was proposed as a biomarker of sarcopenia but its response to interventions designed to increase muscle mass has never been evaluated. The present study was designed to (1) assess eHSP72 levels following resistance training and, (2) determine whether changes in eHSP72 correlate to changes in muscle mass and inflammatory markers. A total of 26 sarcopenic men participated in a 16-week resistance training program. The following variables were measured pre-post-intervention: plasma HSP72, serum high sensitivity (hs) inflammatory markers: interleukin-6 (hsIL-6), C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (hsTNF-Î±), lean body mass (LBM) and appendicular muscle mass index (appMMI). eHSP72 was detected in 47Â % of our participants and its level significantly decreased (PÂ =Â 0.04) after the intervention, with a concomitant increase in several LBM variables and appMMI (all PÂ <Â 0.035). Serum hsIL-6, hsCRP and hsTNF-Î± changes did not reach significance. Baseline hsIL-6 and hsCRP levels were negatively correlated with several LBM variables but solely baseline hsIL-6 was associated with changes in appLBM. No correlations were found between changes in measured variables. Attenuation of eHSP72 following resistance training in parallel with increase in LBM variables showed a concordance between the evolution of this biomarker and a clinical outcome relevant to sarcopenia. Nevertheless, the low bloodstream detection rate of eHSP72 in a sarcopenic otherwise healthy population might limit its use in clinical settings for now.

Histomorphological comparison of rat placentas by different timing of chlorpromazine-administration. The effects of chlorpromazine-treatment timing on the development of the placenta in pregnant rats were examined. Chlorpromazine was administered intraperitoneally at 100mg/kg on gestation day (GD) 11 (GD11-treated group), GD 13 (GD13-treated group) or GD 15 (GD15-treated group) into pregnant rats. All treated dams exhibited decreased body weight, prone position, hypothermia, loss or decrease of locomotor activity, etc. The fetal mortality rates were increased up to 42.9% in the GD11- and GD13-treated groups and up to 16.7% in the GD15-treated group. The embryo/fetal weight was on a declining trend from GD 16 onward, and the intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) rates on GD 21 were increased in all treated groups. The placental weight showed a declining trend from GD 15 onward in all treated groups. Histopathologically, apoptosis was detected 1 or 2 days after treatment, and led to hypoplasia in the labyrinth zone and metrial gland, and cystic degeneration in the basal zone on GD 21 in all treated groups. There was no difference in the histopathological lesions on GD 21 among the treated groups. Thus, it is considered that chlorpromazine-induced placental toxicity is characterized in that there is no obvious specific sensitive period from GD 11 to GD 15. Chlorpromazine induced a non-specific transient development retardation of the placenta by apoptosis independently of the cell proliferation period in each part/zone.

Long-term cyclosporine treatment: evaluation of serum biochemical parameters and histopathological alterations in Wistar rats. The immunosuppressant agent cyclosporine (CsA) is currently used in transplanted patients and in the therapy of autoimmune disorders. CsA treatment has significant acute and chronic side effects on the liver and kidney. However, in the clinical setting, it is difficult to distinguish a direct effect of CsA treatment from other confounding variables, such as allograft rejection and effects due to other drug therapies. In the present study, we assessed for direct associations between CsA immunosuppressive therapy and cytokines levels, kidney and liver functionality, as well as lung histopathological status in rats submitted to chronic CsA treatment without undergoing any transplantation. Male Wistar rats were divided into three groups. The control group received vehicle (corn oil), and treated groups received CsA 5 or 15 mg/kg, by daily gastric gavage during 8 weeks. The results demonstrated that CsA treatment decreases blood levels of interleukins 1Î± (IL-1Î±), 1Î² (IL-1Î²) and interleukin 2 (IL-2), but does not alter interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IFN-Î³ levels. Serum biochemical markers of renal (creatinine) and hepatic (SGPT and SGOT) injury/dysfunction did not vary with CsA treatment, despite the presence of small histological alterations, suggesting that the function of these metabolic organs were preserved. Pulmonary histopathological lesions were observed in the CsA groups, and they were attributed to the activation of the local immunoresponse mechanisms by the normal microbiota in immunosuppressive CsA cases. These results suggest that the CsA concentrations administered in our experimental protocol were able to induce immunosuppression in rats without causing nephro and hepatotoxicity.

Elevated serum gamma-glutamyltransferase activity is associated with increased risk of mortality, incident type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular events, chronic kidney disease and cancer - a narrative review.

Transplatin-conjugated triplex-forming oligonucleotides form adducts with both strands of DNA. Triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) can bind to polypurine x polypyrimidine tracts in DNA and, as a consequence, perturb the normal functioning of a targeted gene. The effectiveness of such antigene TFOs can potentially be enhanced by covalent attachment of the TFO to its DNA target. Here, we report that attachment of N-7-platinated guanine nucleosides to the 3'- and/or 5'-ends of oligopyrimidine TFOs enables these TFOs to form highly stable adducts with target DNA deoxyguanosines or deoxyadenosines that are adjacent to the TFO binding site. Such adduct formation stably anchors the TFO to its target. Depending on the sequences adjacent to the TFO binding site, adduct formation can occur on either strand of the DNA. Adduct formation by 3',5'-bis-platinated TFOs can result in the formation of an interstrand cross-link between both strands of the DNA duplex. Formation of the adducts, which could be reversed by treatment with sodium cyanide, was dependent upon the ability of the TFO to bind to DNA and appeared to occur at a rate slower than that at which the TFO bound to the DNA duplex. The extent of adduct formation at 37 degrees C by platinated deoxyribo-TFOs diminished as the pH was increased from 6.5 to 7.4. In contrast, high levels (approximately 86%) of adduct formation by platinated 2'-O-methylribo-TFOs were observed at both pH 6.5 and pH 7.4. Platinated 2'-O-methylribo-TFOs were also shown to bind to plasmid DNA and inhibit transcription in vitro, and to inhibit plasmid replication in E. coli cells. These results suggest that platinum-conjugated TFOs may be good candidates for use as antigene agents.

Global regulation of gene expression and cell differentiation in Caulobacter crescentus in response to nutrient availability. In a developmental strategy designed to efficiently exploit and colonize sparse oligotrophic environments, Caulobacter crescentus cells divide asymmetrically, yielding a motile swarmer cell and a sessile stalked cell. After a relatively fixed time period under typical culture conditions, the swarmer cell differentiates into a replicative stalked cell. Since differentiation into the stalked cell type is irreversible, it is likely that environmental factors such as the availability of essential nutrients would influence the timing of the decision to abandon motility and adopt a sessile lifestyle. We measured two different parameters in nutrient-limited chemostat cultures, biomass concentration and the ratio of nonstalked to stalked cells, over a range of flow rates and found that nitrogen limitation significantly extended the swarmer cell life span. The transcriptional profiling experiments described here generate the first comprehensive picture of the global regulatory strategies used by an oligotroph when confronted with an environment where key macronutrients are sparse. The pattern of regulated gene expression in nitrogen- and carbon-limited cells shares some features in common with most copiotrophic organisms, but critical differences suggest that Caulobacter, and perhaps other oligotrophs, have evolved regulatory strategies to deal distinctly with their natural environments. We hypothesize that nitrogen limitation extends the swarmer cell lifetime by delaying the onset of a sequence of differentiation events, which when initiated by the correct combination of external environmental cues, sets the swarmer cell on a path to differentiate into a stalked cell within a fixed time period.

Learning postural tasks in hemiparetic patients with lesions of left versus right hemisphere. There are a number of studies concerning difference of postural control following left or right hemisphere lesions. Few studies, however, compare the role of the right and left hemisphere in learning new postural tasks. This study aimed to address this question. Twenty patients with hemiparesis after ischemic stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory (11 with a right and 9 with a left hemispheric lesion) were investigated. All subjects were trained using two different tasks during ten training sessions. In both tasks, the subjects stood on a force platform and were taught to change the position of the center of pressure (COP) presented as a cursor on a monitor screen in front of the patient. The subjects were instructed to align the COP with the target and then move the target by shifting the COP in the indicated direction. In the "Balls" task, the position of the target (a ball) varied randomly, so the subject had to learn a general strategy of voluntary COP control. In "Bricks", the subject always had to move the target in a single direction (downward) from the top to the bottom of the screen, so that a precise postural coordination had to be learned. The number of correctly performed trials for a session was scored. The task performance and its rate were analyzed and compared with respect to the lesion lateralization between two patient groups. The voluntary control of the COP position and learning course were initially impaired in all groups of patients in both tasks. In "Balls", there were no differences between the two groups of patients. In contrast, in "Bricks", there was a greater initial deficit in patients with right hemisphere lesions, while the rate of postural learning and the final performance level did not differ between the groups. With a lower initial deficit and similar rate of learning, the maximal level of the task performance was reached earlier (on the 5th day of training) in patients with left hemisphere lesions. This group stopped improving its performance during follow-up training. The results suggest that the motor structures of the right hemisphere are more involved in the precise control of COP trajectory, but not in learning. There is no difference between hemispheres in the initial performance and learning of the general strategy of voluntary COP control. Possibly, the control of specific COP trajectory needs more sensory feedback that is associated with greater involvement of the right hemisphere. This might be a reason for the greater initial impairment of this task after lesions in the right hemisphere.

The Role of Neighborhood in the Development of Aggression in Urban African American Youth: A Multilevel Analysis. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of neighborhood disadvantage and perceptions of neighborhood on the development of aggressive behavior among a sample of urban low-income African American middle school aged youth (mean ageÂ =Â 11.65Â years). Results of hierarchical linear modeling indicated that youth experienced significant changes in rates of aggression across the three middle school years, and that on average, negative youth perceptions of neighborhood predicted increases in aggression. Both parent and youth perceptions of neighborhood disadvantage trended toward significance as a moderator between objective neighborhood characteristics and aggression. These results are in accordance with past research, which suggests that personal evaluations of the disadvantage of a neighborhood influence child development and behavior. Future studies should examine the role that perceptions play in youth development, as well as in interventions geared towards thwarting youth aggression. 

Calcium signaling cascade links dopamine D1-D2 receptor heteromer to striatal BDNF production and neuronal growth. Although the perturbation of either the dopaminergic system or brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels has been linked to important neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, there is no known signaling pathway linking these two major players. We found that the exclusive stimulation of the dopamine D1-D2 receptor heteromer, which we identified in striatal neurons and adult rat brain by using confocal FRET, led to the activation of a signaling cascade that links dopamine signaling to BDNF production and neuronal growth through a cascade of four steps: (i) mobilization of intracellular calcium through Gq, phospholipase C, and inositol trisphosphate, (ii) rapid activation of cytosolic and nuclear calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIalpha, (iii) increased BDNF expression, and (iv) accelerated morphological maturation and differentiation of striatal neurons, marked by increased microtubule-associated protein 2 production. These effects, although robust in striatal neurons from D5(-/-) mice, were absent in neurons from D1(-/-) mice. We also demonstrated that this signaling cascade was activated in adult rat brain, although with regional specificity, being largely limited to the nucleus accumbens. This dopaminergic pathway regulating neuronal growth and maturation through BDNF may have considerable significance in disorders such as drug addiction, schizophrenia, and depression.

Serologically verified human bocavirus pneumonia in children. Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a newly identified parvovirus frequently found in children suffering from acute respiratory and intestinal infections. The aim of the present study was to evaluate, by using a newly developed antibody assay, the role of HBoV in pediatric community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and the seropositivity rate to HBoV in a prospective study in North-Italian children. During a 15-month study period, 124 children were admitted due to presumptive pneumonia, and in 101 of them, pneumonia was radiologically confirmed. The etiology of CAP was studied by antibody assays to 16 microbes, including the newly developed enzyme immunoassay for HBoV. Serological evidence of acute HBoV infection was found in 12 (12%) children, being single in 7 and mixed in 5 cases (4 with other viruses and 3 with bacteria). IgM was positive in 11 cases. A diagnostic rise in IgG antibodies between paired sera was observed in six cases. HBoV was the second most common virus next to respiratory syncytial virus (17%). The seropositivity rate to HBoV increased with age, reaching nearly 100% before school age. The present results show that HBoV is able to induce significant antibody responses and suggest that HBoV may be a fairly common cause of pneumonia in children. Seroconversion to HBoV in most children takes place in early childhood.

Arsenic trioxide-mediated Notch pathway inhibition depletes the cancer stem-like cell population in gliomas. Cancer stem-like cells (CSLCs) are potential targets for treatment of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) due to their role in tumorigenesis and recurrence. In this study, we investigated the inhibitory effect of arsenic trioxide (As(2)O(3)) on CSLCs of GBM in human glioma cell lines (U87MG, U251MG and U373MG) in vivo and in vitro. Immunofluorescence staining and flow cytometry revealed that the percentage of Nestin-positive cells in the aforementioned cell lines was diminished by 12%, 14% and 7%, respectively, after treatment with 2 microM As(2)O(3). Furthermore, we used soft-agar in U87MG and tumor xenografts in nude mice to demonstrate the ability of As(2)O(3) to inhibit the formation of tumor in the three cell lines. These results indicate the negative regulation of CSLCs by As(2)O(3). In addition, a Western blot analysis revealed decreased levels of Notch1 and Hes1 proteins due to As(2)O(3) treatment. We conclude that As(2)O(3) has a remarkable inhibitory effect on CSLCs in glioma cell lines in vivo and in vitro; in addition, we determined that the mechanism of CSLC inhibition involves the deregulation of Notch activation.

Comparison of the disease activity score using the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein levels in Koreans with rheumatoid arthritis. The Disease Activity Score based on 28 joints (DAS28) has been widely used in clinical practice and research studies of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The objective of this study was to evaluate the discordance in the DAS28 based on the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) versus C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in Korean patients with RA. From August to December 2011, 540 patients with RA who visited two rheumatology clinics affiliated with Hallym University (Korea) and had at least one DAS28 evaluation were examined. The mean age of the included patients was 53Â years, and 82% were female. The mean duration of disease was 32.9Â Â±Â 41.2Â months. The mean DAS28-ESR was higher than the DAS28-CRP (3.65 vs. 3.44; PÂ <Â 0.001). In the DAS28-ESR group, 126 patients (23.3%) satisfied the criteria for remission versus 134 (24.8%) in the DAS28-CRP group. High disease activity was determined in 80 (14.8%) patients in the DAS28-ESR group and in 43 (8.0%) in the DAS28-CRP group. A comparison of the two groups with respect to four DAS28 disease activity categories showed agreement in 344 patients (63.7%; ÎºÂ =Â 0.45). In classifying patients as European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) responders, agreement between the two methods was shown in 56 patients (71.8%; ÎºÂ =Â 0.76). When disagreements between the two scores occurred, more patients had a better EULAR response based on the DAS28-ESR than on the DAS28-CRP (19.2% vs. 8.9%, respectively). The discordance between the ESR-based and CRP-based DAS28 could affect clinical treatment decisions for patients with RA.

Cardiac arrhythmias induced by glutathione oxidation can be inhibited by preventing mitochondrial depolarization. We have previously proposed that the heterogeneous collapse of mitochondrial inner membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)) during ischemia and reperfusion contributes to arrhythmogenesis through the formation of metabolic sinks in the myocardium, wherein clusters of myocytes with uncoupled mitochondria and high K(ATP) current levels alter electrical propagation to promote reentry. Single myocyte studies have also shown that cell-wide DeltaPsi(m) depolarization, through a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced ROS release mechanism, can be triggered by global depletion of the antioxidant pool with diamide, a glutathione oxidant. Here we examine whether diamide causes mitochondrial depolarization and promotes arrhythmias in normoxic isolated perfused guinea pig hearts. We also investigate whether stabilization of DeltaPsi(m) with a ligand of the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor (4'-chlorodiazepam; 4-ClDzp) prevents the formation of metabolic sinks and, consequently, precludes arrhythmias. Oxidation of the GSH pool was initiated by treatment with 200 microM diamide for 35 min, followed by washout. This treatment increased GSSG and decreased both total GSH and the GSH/GSSG ratio. All hearts receiving diamide transitioned from sinus rhythm into ventricular tachycardia and/or ventricular fibrillation during the diamide exposure: arrhythmia scores were 5.5+/-0.5; n=6 hearts. These arrhythmias and impaired LV function were significantly inhibited by co-administration of 4-ClDzp (64 microM): arrhythmia scores with diamide+4-ClDzp were 0.4+/-0.2 (n=5; P<0.05 vs. diamide alone). Imaging DeltaPsi(m) in intact hearts revealed the heterogeneous collapse of DeltaPsi(m) beginning 20 min into diamide, paralleling the timeframe for the onset of arrhythmias. Loss of DeltaPsi(m) was prevented by 4-ClDzp treatment, as was the increase in myocardial GSSG. These findings show that oxidative stress induced by oxidation of GSH with diamide can cause electromechanical dysfunction under normoxic conditions. Analogous to ischemia-reperfusion injury, the dysfunction depends on the mitochondrial energy state. Targeting the mitochondrial benzodiazepine receptor can prevent electrical and mechanical dysfunction in both models of oxidative stress.

The detection of microscopic markers of hemorrhaging and wound age on dry bone: a pilot study. An example of the barriers and conceptual differences between forensic anthropology and pathology can be seen in determining the vitality of a wound. Pathology can make use of skin color and microscopic techniques; anthropology (as concerns the study of dry bone) needs different criteria. The diagnosis of the vitality of a wound (whether it is produced antemortem or postmortem) as well as determination of the time elapsed between the production of the wound and death is a crucial issue in forensic pathology. In fresh skin, the red-purplish coloration of a cut or bruise will reveal its vitality, whereas the change in coloration, from a macroscopic perspective, will reveal the time of survival. In more difficult cases, microscopic analyses can be performed. Bone follows similar "laws" as concerns the evolution of the histologic picture, but even if the beginning of healing processes (periosteal bone production and callus formation) can be detected macroscopically and radiologically, these processes require a long time.The scope of this pilot study was therefore to collect bone fractures from cadavers with a known time of survival, have them undergo a simulated putrefaction procedure until they became "dry or macerated bone" and perform macroscopic and microscopic analysis to verify the potential of histology in identifying "vital" processes in putrefied soft-tissue-free bone.A total of 6 samples of fractured bone (cranium, rib, and tibia) were taken from cadavers with known time of survival between trauma and death. Time intervals ranged from a few seconds after the bone fracture had been inflicted, to several hours, days, and weeks. A negative control was included (postmortem fracture). The bone was decalcified and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Perls' (for the demonstration of hemosiderin deposits), Periodic Acid Schiff, phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin, and Weigert (for the demonstration of fibrin). Immunohistochemistry was performed using a monoclonal antibody antihuman Glycophorin A.Results show the presence of clots and red blood cell residues on the fractured margins, strongly indicative of vital reaction.This study, though certainly not conclusive, shows that it may be worth pursuing the study of bone fractures from a histopathological point of view even on "dry bone" to verify whether the fracture is vital or not, and, if so, if its time of production can be verified.

Diesel exhaust particles stimulate adaptive immunity by acting on pulmonary dendritic cells. Particulate matter, such as diesel exhaust particles (DEPs), modulate adaptive immune responses in the lung; however, their mechanism of action remains largely unclear. Pulmonary dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial mediators in regulating immune responses. We hypothesized that the immunomodulatory effects of DEPs are caused by alteration of DC function. To test this, we instilled mice with DEPs and examined the pulmonary DC recruitment and maturation, their migration to the mediastinal lymph node (MLN), and the subsequent T cell response. We demonstrated that exposure to DEPs increased DC numbers in the bronchoalveolar lavage and the lungs and that DEPs increased the maturation status of these DCs. DEP exposure also enhanced the DC migration to the MLN. Moreover, we showed that DEPs themselves were transported to the MLN in a CCR7- and DC-dependent manner. This resulted in an enhanced T cell recruitment and effector differentiation in the MLN. These data suggest that DEP inhalation modulates immune responses in the lung via stimulation of DC function.

[Curcumine inhibits migration and invasion of hepatic stellate cells by reducing MMP-2 expression and activity]. To investigate the molecular mechanism of the inhibitory effect of curcumine on the migration and invasion of hepatic stellate cells (HSC). Rat hepatic stellate cells were cultured and activated with ConA. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression and activity was determined by Western blot and gelatin zymography. Migration and invasion of HSC was assessed by wound healing assay and modified Boyden chamber assay. Curcumine reduced the level and activity of MMP-2 expression in activated HSC in a dose-dependent manner. When treated with 25, 50 or 100 micromol/L curcumine, the expression of MMP-2 was reduced by 21.8%+/-5.1%, 65.5%+/-9.2% or 87.9%+/-11.5% (P < 0.05), and the activity of MMP-2 was also significantly reduced by curcumine. Migration and invasion of activated HSC was also inhibited by curcumine in a dose-dependent way. When treated with 25, 50 or 100 micromol/L curcumine, the migration of activated HSC was reduced by 27.5%+/-5.8%, 54.4%+/-7.6% or 67.1%+/-9.3% (P < 0.05), and the invasion of activated HSC was also significantly reduced by curcumine. Curcumine inhibits migration and invasion of activated HSC by reducing MMP-2 expression and activity.

Development of a realistic head model for EEG event-detection and source localization in newborn infants. In this work we present an integrated method for electroencephalography (EEG) source localization in newborn infants, based on a realistic head model. To build a realistic head model we propose an interactive hybrid segmentation method for T1 magnetic resonance images (MRI), consisting of active contours, fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering and mathematical morphology. Subsequently, we solve the localization problem using a spike train detection algorithm and an algorithm that deals with the forward and inverse problem. The performance of this fused method indicates that our realistic head model is suitable for the accurate localization of the EEG activity. We will present both initial qualitative and quantitative results.

Short communication: HIV type 1 genetic diversity among tea plantation workers in Kericho, Kenya. In preparation for HIV-1 vaccine trials in Kenya, 2801 study volunteers, from a tea plantation in Kericho, were recruited as part of a prospective vaccine cohort development study. Cryopreserved plasma was available from 401 HIV-positive volunteers, and was the source of viral RNA for genotyping by the multiregion hybridization assay (MHA). Logistic regression was performed to determine association of risk factors and HIV-1 recombinant and dual infections. At baseline, HIV-1 subtype A was the dominant circulating pure subtype (56%), followed by subtype D (10%) and C (5%). Recombinant HIV-1 strains accounted for almost one-third of all infections (29%), with 7% infected with a dual strain of the HIV-1 variants described. A higher number of HIV-1 recombinant and dual infections was observed among volunteers who were 18-24 and 25-29 years of age, affiliated with the Luo tribe, had been married two or more times, reported not being circumcised, and had STI symptoms in the past 6 months. Adjusted odds ratios (AOR) significantly associated with HIV-1 recombinant and dual infection were age difference from current spouse (5-9 years; AOR = 2.5, 95% CI = 1.2-5.3 and > or = 10 years; AOR = 3.1, 95% CI = 1.5-6.4) and reported STI symptoms in the past 6 months (AOR = 4.8, 95% CI = 2.0-11.6), respectively. In conclusion, our results suggest that there is considerable heterogeneity with respect to HIV-1 subtype diversity in this population that should be considered in the planning for future vaccine trials in the region.

Increases in soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors coincide with increases in interleukin-6 and proteinases after major surgery. To determine whether increases in soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors (sTNFRs) are associated with the levels of cytokines and proteinases in patients undergoing major surgery. Eleven patients who underwent esophagectomy for squamous cell carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus were studied. The circulating blood concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, sTNF-R55, sTNF-R75, elastase/al-proteinase inhibitor complex (elastase) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) were measured by ELISA or EIA before surgery, just after surgery, and on postoperative days (POD) 1 and 3. The levels of serum IL-6, plasma IL-8, plasma elastase and plasma MMP-9 increased significantly after surgery, peaking just after surgery or on POD 1 and then declining. In contrast, the serum levels of sTNFRs increased approximately 2-fold just after surgery compared with the preoperative values and then remained elevated. The IL-6 level correlated with the levels of sTNF-R55 and sTNF-R75 after surgery. These results suggest that increases of IL-6, serine proteinases and MMPs may be involved in the upregulation of sTNFRs in patients undergoing major surgery.

[Diagnosis and treatment tactics of Caroli disease]. The results of surgical treatment of 7 patients, in whom disease of Karoly type I was diagnosed, were analyzed.

The choose of sugical treatment method of the patients depends on volumic cystic affection of intrahepatic biliary ducts and presence of strictured portions in them.

Competition drives sophisticated hunting skills of archerfish in the wild. Several animals are renowned for their cognitive skills, such as tool use, metacognition or social learning. However, it remains puzzling why some species excel whereas others - sometimes even closely related ones - do not. Archerfish show a remarkable assembly of skills in the context of their unique hunting behavior in which they down aerial prey with shots of water. Hoping to find ecological factors behind these skills, we have over the past years regularly traveled to archerfish mangrove habitats in Thailand (Figure 1A). One of our most consistent findings was the presence of other surface-feeding fish, particularly the similar-sized halfbeak Zenarchopterus buffonis, wherever we spotted groups of archerfish (Figure 1A; Supplemental movie S1). We describe here that Zenarchopterus is superbly equipped with water-wave detectors, rapidly detects the impact of prey even in the dark, is active at all times, is usually more numerous than archerfish and supplements its capabilities with visual skills. Without sophisticated additions to their hunting technique archerfish would thus lose most of their downed prey to halfbeaks. We suggest that the evolution of several skills of archerfish may have thus been influenced not only by intraspecific competition [5] but also by competition with other surface-feeding fish species.

Regulation of neurite outgrowth by interactions between the scaffolding protein, JNK-associated leucine zipper protein, and neuronal growth-associated protein superior cervical ganglia clone 10. JLP (JNK-associated leucine zipper protein) is a novel scaffolding protein involved in JNK signaling. Although it is known that JLP is highly expressed in brain, the biological function of JLP in neuronal systems remains unknown. Here, we report a novel interaction between JLP and SCG10 (superior cervical ganglia clone 10), which is a microtubule-destabilizing factor that is essential for neurite outgrowth. Inhibition of endogenous JLP expression using small interference RNA methodology strongly enhanced nerve growth factor (NGF)-induced neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. Our results show that JLP negatively regulates NGF-induced neurite outgrowth by decreasing the level of phosphorylated SCG10. Furthermore, inhibition of JNK phosphorylation by a small molecule inhibitor, SP600125, resulted in inhibition of SCG10 phosphorylation and inhibition of neurite growth. Taken together, our results suggest that JLP negatively regulates NGF-induced neurite outgrowth through a sequestering mechanism that results in an attenuation of NGF-induced SCG10 phosphorylation.


Lipid droplet analysis in caveolin-deficient adipocytes: alterations in surface phospholipid composition and maturation defects.

Injuries about the shoulder in skiing and snowboarding. There has been a decrease in the overall injury rate, particularly the rate of lower-extremity injuries, for alpine skiing, with a resultant increase in the ratio of upper-extremity to lower-extremity injuries. The upper extremity is injured nearly twice as often during snowboarding than alpine skiing, with approximately half of all snowboarding injuries involving the upper extremity. Shoulder injuries are likely under-reported, as many patients seek evaluation for minor shoulder injuries with their local physicians, and not at the ski medical clinic, where most epidemiology studies obtain their data. Shoulder injuries account for 4 to 11% of all alpine skiing injuries and 22 to 41% of upper-extremity injuries. During snowboarding, shoulder injuries account for 8 to 16% of all injuries and 20 to 34% of upper-extremity injuries. Falls are the most common mechanism of shoulder injury, in addition to pole planting during skiing and aerial manoeuvres during snowboarding. Common shoulder injuries during skiing and snowboarding are rotator cuff strains, glenohumeral dislocations, acromioclavicular separations and clavicle fractures. It is still unclear, when comparing snowboarding and skiing injury data, which sport has the higher incidence of shoulder injuries. Stratifying shoulder injuries by type allows better delineation as to which sport has an increased incidence of certain injury patterns. The differing mechanisms of injury combined with distinct equipment for each sport plays a role in the type and frequency of shoulder injuries seen in these two subgroups. With the increased ratio of upper- to lower-extremity injuries during alpine skiing and the boom in popularity of snowboarding, shoulder injuries are seen with increasing frequency by those who care for alpine sport injuries. According to recent epidemiological data, only clavicle and humerus fractures have shown increased rates of incidence among alpine skiers. Over the past 30 years, there has been a general decrease in both upper- and lower-extremity injuries which can be attributed to improved designs of protective equipment, increased awareness of injury patterns and emphasis on prevention. In the future, physicians and therapists who treat this population must be comfortable and confident in their treatment algorithms to help keep skiers and snowboarders conditioned and ready for the slopes and develop strategies for the prevention of upper-extremity injuries associated with these activities.

Do galectins play a role in venous thrombosis? a review. Galectins are a family of carbohydrate-binding proteins that have a high affinity to galactosides on cell surfaces and extra cellular glycoproteins. They are involved in a variety of biological functions, including modulation of cell apoptosis, cell activation and inflammation. Our laboratory has recently identified galectin-3 binding protein (Gal-3BP) as being up-regulated in a microparticle proteomics analysis for deep venous thrombosis (DVT) patients compared to negative controls. P-selectin, another glycoprotein involved in thrombus propagation, has proven a promising target for DVT management and has been widely studied by our group. Galectins are involved in P-selectin expression and can potentially be implicated in the venous thrombogenesis process. The function of galectins, their role in inflammation and thrombosis as well as their potential implications as a new pharmacological target for DVT management are reviewed in this manuscript.

The positively charged region of the myosin IIC non-helical tailpiece promotes filament assembly. The motor protein, non-muscle myosin II (NMII), must undergo dynamic oligomerization into filaments to participate in cellular processes such as cell migration and cytokinesis. A small non-helical region at the tail of the long coiled-coil region (tailpiece) is a common feature of all dynamically assembling myosin II proteins. In this study, we investigated the role of the tailpiece in NMII-C self-assembly. We show that the tailpiece is natively unfolded, as seen by circular dichroism and NMR experiments, and is divided into two regions of opposite charge. The positively charged region (Tailpiece(1946-1967)) starts at residue 1946 and is extended by seven amino acids at its N terminus from the traditional coiled-coil ending proline (Tailpiece(1953-1967)). Pull-down and sedimentation assays showed that the positive Tailpiece(1946-1967) binds to assembly incompetent NMII-C fragments inducing filament assembly. The negative region, residues 1968-2000, is responsible for NMII paracrystal morphology as determined by chimeras in which the negative region was swapped between the NMII isoforms. Mixing the positive and negative peptides had no effect on the ability of the positive peptide to bind and induce filament assembly. This study provides molecular insight into the role of the structurally disordered tailpiece of NMII-C in shifting the oligomeric equilibrium of NMII-C toward filament assembly and determining its morphology.

History of surgery for atrial fibrillation. There is a rich history of surgery for atrial fibrillation. Initial procedures were aimed at controlling the ventricular response rate. Later procedures were directed at converting atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm. These culminated in the Cox Maze III procedure. While highly effective, the complexity and morbidity of the cut and sew Maze III limited its adoption. Enabling technology has developed alternate energy sources designed to produce a transmural atrial scar without cutting and sewing. Termed the Maze IV, this lessened the morbidity of the procedure and widened the applicability. Further advances in minimal access techniques are now being developed to allow totally thorascopic placement of all the left atrial lesions on the full, beating heart, using alternate energy sources.

Internal open brain injury or cranial burst fracture: report of 8 cases. We report a special type of skull fracture in children - internal open brain injury (IOBI). We summarize its clinical characteristics and propose a treatment strategy based on our experience. Eight patients between 2 and 5 years old were identified to have IOBI. Preoperative computed tomography (CT) scanning was performed in each case and magnetic resonance imaging was conducted when available. All patients were treated surgically. The clinical data were retrospectively analyzed and each patient underwent follow-up CT scanning. IOBI has no special clinical manifestations other than scalp swelling, linear skull fracture and local brain contusion. Acute cerebral extrusion outside the calvaria and lacerated dura mater were seen during operation in each patient. Each patient's neurological status generally improved after surgery. No patient developed posttraumatic epilepsy during the 4- to 20-month follow-up period. IOBI is a type of head trauma in which dura mater is lacerated and the cerebrum is extruded outside the calvaria but the scalp remains intact. Craniotomy with evacuation of devitalized brain tissue and dural repair should be performed.

Antiproliferative Activity of seco-Oxacassanes from Acacia schaffneri. This work reports the antiproliferative activity of seco-oxacassanes 1-3, isolated from Acacia schaffneri, against human colon (HT-29), lung (A-549), and melanoma (UACC-62) cancer cell lines, as well as against their non-malignant counterparts CCD-841 CoN, MRC-5, and VH-10, respectively, using the sulforhodamine B test. While compounds 1 and 3 were inactive, 2 presented strong activity with IC50 values between 0.12 and 0.92 Î¼g mL(-1). The cytotoxicity mechanisms of 2 were investigated by cell cycle analysis and through DNA repair pathways, indicating that the compound is capable of arresting the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase. This effect might be generated through damage to DNA by alkylation. In addition, compound 2 was able to decrease HT-29 migration.

[Vaccination practices following the end of compulsory BCG vaccination. A cross-sectional survey of general practitioners and pediatricians]. Tuberculosis prevention has been based on generalized BCG vaccination in France since 1949. The aim of this cross-sectional survey was to assess the impact of the change in BCG administration (in January 2006) and the end of compulsory vaccination (in July 2007). A self-administered postal questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 2248 physicians practicing in 6 departments in the RhÃ´ne-Alpes region in 2008. Overall, 923 questionnaires were analyzed. The median age of the respondents was 52 years, 67 % were male, 93 % were general practitioners, and 91 % practiced in private practice offices. The median number of BCG vaccines administered on a quarterly basis was 5 (interquartile range [IQR], 3-10) before January 2006, one (IQR, 0-3) between January 2006 and July 2007, and zero (IQR, 0-1) after July 2007 (P<0.001). The rate of BCG vaccination was significantly lower for male physicians, physicians older than 50 years, general practitioners, practitioners working in private offices, and for some departments. Thirty-nine percent of the physicians were informed of the national program against tuberculosis 2007-2009, and 41 % wished to be trained in the practice of intradermal vaccination. This survey suggests that the withdrawal of Monovax and the lifting of generalized vaccination requirements were followed by a substantial decrease in the number of BCG vaccinations. The intradermal route constitutes an obstacle for BCG vaccination that might be overcome by specific training.

Molluscicides from some common medicinal plants of eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. Many aquatic snails act as intermediate hosts for the larvae of trematodes, Fasciola hepatica and Fasciola gigantica, which cause the diseases fascioliasis and schistosomiasis. The WHO has tested several thousands of synthetic compounds for the control of the snail host. Although effective, these molluscicides have so far not proved themselves to be entirely satisfactory. With a growing awareness of environmental pollution, efforts are being made to discover molluscicidal products of plant origin. Being products of biosynthesis, these are potentially biodegradable in nature. Several groups of compounds present in various plants have been found to be toxic to target organisms at acceptable doses ranging from <1 to 100 ppm. Common medicinal plants, i.e. Thevetia peruviana, Alstonia scholaris (Family; Apocynaceae), Euphorbia pulcherima and Euphorbia hirta (Family; Euphorbiaceae), have potent molluscicidal activity against freshwater snails. The toxicological actions of Thevetia peruviana may be due to the presence of apigenin-5-methyl ether (flavonoid) and triterpenoid glycosides, while a number of alkaloids (pseudo-akuammigine in addition to betulin, ursolic acid and beta-sitosterol), steroids and triterpenoids are present in Alstonia scholaris and the diterpenoids, pulcherrol, beta-sitosterol, hentriacontane, ellagic acid and beta-amyrin are present in Euphorbia hirta and in Euphorbia pulcherima. Although, at present very little literature is available on the control of vector snails through plant origin pesticides, an attempt has been made in this review to assemble all the known information on molluscicidal properties of common medicinal plants of eastern Uttar Pradesh, India, which might be useful for the control of harmful snails.


Criminalization, legalization or decriminalization of sex work: what female sex workers say in San Francisco, USA.

Leveraging neighborhood-scale change for policy and program reform in Buffalo, New York. The Healthy Communities Initiative (HCI) affects 8500 employees working in the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus and 8925 residents of adjacent neighborhoods, where 37% of people live below the poverty line, and a majority (68.7%) identify themselves as African-American. The HCI partnership, which includes multi-sectoral and multi-disciplinary organizations and neighborhood residents, implemented the Active Living by Design community action model with greatest emphasis on achieving policy and planning changes to support active living behaviors. The master plan of the campus now incorporates active living as a guiding principle. Physical improvements to support walking and bicycling in the target area have been planned and implemented through a $14 million federal transportation grant. The partnership facilitated the creation of a citywide Bicycle and Pedestrian Advisory Board and the passage and implementation of an ordinance to enhance bicycling infrastructure within the city. Buffalo's experience suggests that to achieve lasting environmental change in the context of a medical campus and its surrounding neighborhoods, it is critical to: (1) engage neighborhood residents from the outset to build social capital; (2) cultivate a diverse partnership; (3) use a comprehensive approach; (4) balance long-term goals with short-term accomplishments; (5) integrate active living concerns within existing policy and planning mandates; and (6) make sustainability a priority. Environmental changes in the public domain that support active living require collaboration among public, nonprofit, and private sectors; citizen engagement; and the presence of a legal and structural framework provided by government policies and plans to direct future development.

["Standard" protocol for evaluating the impact of preanalytical variables on peptidic and proteic analytes and standard coding of preanalytical procedures]. The SFBC Working Group on << Preanalytics and multiplex analyses in proteomics >> is presenting a protocol which will allow harmonization of biospecimen research studies on the impact of different preanalytical variations on peptidic and protein analytes. This protocol is based upon standardization of preanalytical options corresponding to different preanalytical variations and different types of biospecimens (serum, plasma, cedrebrospinal fluid and urine). Application of this protocol will allow, not only harmonization of Biospecimen research, but also elaboration of standard nomenclature of the preanalytical steps.

Physical and chemical stability of iron sucrose in parenteral nutrition. Current literature supports iron dextran as the only iron preparation compatible with parenteral nutrition (PN). Iron sucrose has been used for iron replacement therapy because of its lower rate of adverse events. The purpose of this study is to determine the physical and chemical stability of iron sucrose in PN. Physical and chemical stability of iron sucrose in nonlipid PN solutions (PN 1 for neonates and PN 2 for patients weighing >20 kg) is tested over time in triplicate. Physical stability is determined by visually inspecting each PN solution for particulate matter and by filtering and analyzing each aliquot quantitatively for crystal precipitates. Chemical stability is confirmed if the iron concentrations by mass spectrometry remain within United States Pharmacopeia (USP) standards. Visual clarity is maintained in all PN solutions at hours 0 through 4. PN solution 1 remains clear for hours 8 through 24, whereas PN solution 2 shows an increase in particulate matter by 8 hours. All PN solutions 2 are considered visually incompatible by hour 24. Physical stability of iron sucrose for PN solutions 1 and 2 from hours 0 to 4 is within the USP guidelines for crystalline particulate matter. At hour 24, only solution 1 remains within USP guidelines. Chemical stability data indicate that iron concentrations are maintained throughout the 24-hour time period. The physical stability of iron sucrose in PN is time and concentration dependent. Concentrations >0.25 mg/dL showed increasing particulate and should not be added to PN. However, iron sucrose is chemically stable in PN solutions.

Identification of resolvin D2 receptor mediating resolution of infections and organ protection. Endogenous mechanisms that orchestrate resolution of acute inflammation are essential in host defense and the return to homeostasis. Resolvin (Rv)D2 is a potent immunoresolvent biosynthesized during active resolution that stereoselectively stimulates resolution of acute inflammation. Here, using an unbiased G protein-coupled receptor-Î²-arrestin-based screening and functional sensing systems, we identified a receptor for RvD2, namely GPR18, that is expressed on human leukocytes, including polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), monocytes, and macrophages (MÎ¦). In human MÎ¦, RvD2-stimulated intracellular cyclic AMP was dependent on GPR18. RvD2-stimulated phagocytosis of Escherichia coli and apoptotic PMN (efferocytosis) were enhanced with GPR18 overexpression and significantly reduced by shRNA knockdown. Specific binding of RvD2 to recombinant GPR18 was confirmed using a synthetic (3)H-labeled-RvD2. Scatchard analysis gave a Kd of â¼10 nM consistent with RvD2 bioactive concentration range. In both E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus infections, RvD2 limited PMN infiltration, enhanced phagocyte clearance of bacteria, and accelerated resolution. These actions were lost in GPR18-deficient mice. During PMN-mediated second organ injury, RvD2's protective actions were also significantly diminished in GPR18-deficient mice. Together, these results provide evidence for a novel RvD2-GPR18 resolution axis that stimulates human and mouse phagocyte functions to control bacterial infections and promote organ protection. 


Score tests for exploring complex models: application to HIV dynamics models.

MR imaging of the fetal brain. Fetal MRI is clinically performed to evaluate the brain in cases where an abnormality is detected by prenatal sonography. These most commonly include ventriculomegaly, abnormalities of the corpus callosum, and abnormalities of the posterior fossa. Fetal MRI is also increasingly performed to evaluate fetuses who have normal brain findings on prenatal sonogram but who are at increased risk for neurodevelopmental abnormalities, such as complicated monochorionic twin pregnancies. This paper will briefly discuss the common clinical conditions imaged by fetal MRI as well as recent advances in fetal MRI research.


Plasmodium falciparum glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconolactonase is a potential drug target.

Nucleic acid-passivated semiconductor nanocrystals: biomolecular templating of form and function. Bright, photostable luminescent labels are powerful tools for the in vitro and in vivo imaging of biological events. Semiconductor nanocrystals have emerged as attractive alternatives to commonly used organic lumophores because of their high quantum yields and the spectral tunability that can be achieved through synthetic control. Although conventional synthetic methods generally yield high-quality nanocrystals with excellent optical properties for biological imaging, ligand exchange and biological conjugation are necessary to make nanocrystals biocompatible and biospecific. These steps can substantially deteriorate the optical characteristics of these nanocrystals. Moreover, the complexity of multistep nanocrystal synthesis, typically requiring inert and anhydrous conditions, prohibits many end users of these lumiphores from generating their own custom materials. We sought to streamline semiconductor nanocrystal synthesis and develop synthetic routes that would be accessible to scientists from all disciplines. In search of such an approach, we turned to nucleic acids as a programmable and versatile ligand set and found that these biomolecules are indeed appropriate for biocompatible semiconductor nanocrystals preparation. In this Account, we summarize our work on nucleic acids-programmed nanocrystal synthesis that has resulted in the successful development of a one-step synthesis of biofunctionalized nanocrystals in aqueous solution. We first discuss results obtained with nucleotide-capped cadmium and lead chalcogenide-based nanocrystals that served to guide further investigation of polynucleotide-assisted synthesis. We investigated the roles of individual nucleobases and their structures in passivation of the surfaces of nanocrystals and modulating morphology and optical characteristics. The nucleic acid structures and sequences and the reaction conditions greatly influence the nanocrystals' optical properties and morphologies. Moreover, studies using live cells reveal low toxicity and rapid uptake of DNA-passivated CdS nanocrystals, demonstrating their suitability for bioimaging. Finally, we describe a new approach that leads to the production of biofunctionalized, DNA-capped nanocrystals in a single step. Chimeric DNA molecules enable this strategy, providing both a domain for nanocrystal passivation and a domain for biomolecule recognition. Nanocrystals synthesized using this approach possess good spectral characteristics as well as high specificity to cognate DNA, protein, and cancer cell targets. Overall, this approach could make nanocrystal lumiphores more readily accessible to researchers working in the biological sciences.

Mild and moderate hypothermia increases platelet aggregation induced by various agonists: a whole blood in vitro study. The mechanisms causing temperature-dependent bleeding, especially in hypothermic patients, warrant clarification. Therefore the aim of this study was to investigate platelet aggregation at the clinically important temperature range of 30-34 degrees C. After obtaining informed consent citrated whole blood was drawn from 12 healthy adult male volunteers, who had not taken any medication in the previous 14 days. After venipuncture blood samples were incubated at 37 degrees C until platelet testing. Platelet aggregation was performed in whole blood using the impedance aggregometer Multiplate at five different test temperatures between 30 degrees C and 34 degrees C. Aggregation responses at 37 degrees C served as controls. At temperatures of mild and moderate hypothermia (30-34 degrees C), overall platelet aggregation was increased compared to 37 degrees C. Increases were recorded in response to collagen, thrombin receptor activating peptide and ristocetin between 31 degrees C and 34 degrees C and in response to adenosine diphosphate between 30 degrees C and 34 degrees C. Overall platelet aggregation is increased at mild and moderate hypothermia down to 30 degrees C. These results indicate that bleeding complications reported in mildly hypothermic patients are not due to hypothermia-induced platelet inhibition. The pathomechanism of the overall increased platelet aggregation between 30 degrees C and 34 degrees C requires further detailed study.

Modulation of instantaneous synchrony during seizures by deep brain stimulation. Epileptic seizures were experimentally induced in the CA3 region of rat hippocampus in vivo. Recordings of seizure activity were made in both hippocampi as well as anteromedial region of the thalamus in order to analyze the instantaneous activity for synchronous oscillators. A new method is introduced for detecting this synchrony which combines empirical mode decomposition, the Hilbert analytic signal method and eigenvalue decomposition. Effects of targeted deep brain stimulation on multi-site synchrony were assessed as a means to extinguish hypersynchrony during epileptic seizures.

Lumbar split cord malformation with lateral hemimyelomeningocele and associated Chiari II malformation and other visceral and osseous anomalies: a case report. Split cord malformation and lateral hemimyelomeningocele are 2 rare spinal anomalies, which were both discovered in a female newborn. The constellation of anomalies is presented in the setting of Chiari II malformation. Cross-sectional imaging of the salient abnormalities in the form of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging along with 3-dimensional and multiplanar reformatting is highlighted.


Bacterial synthesis, purification, and solubilization of membrane protein KCNE3, a regulator of voltage-gated potassium channels.

Quantitative proteomic analysis of purified yeast kinetochores identifies a PP1 regulatory subunit. The kinetochore is a macromolecular complex that controls chromosome segregation and cell cycle progression. When sister kinetochores make bioriented attachments to microtubules from opposite poles, the spindle checkpoint is silenced. Biorientation and the spindle checkpoint are regulated by a balance between the Ipl1/Aurora B protein kinase and the opposing activity of protein phosphatase I (PP1). However, little is known about the regulation of PP1 localization and activity at the kinetochore. Here, we developed a method to purify centromere-bound kinetochores and used quantitative proteomics to identify the Fin1 protein as a PP1 regulatory subunit. The Fin1/PP1 complex is regulated by phosphorylation and 14-3-3 protein binding. When Fin1 is mislocalized, bipolar spindles fail to assemble but the spindle checkpoint is inappropriately silenced due to PP1 activity. These data suggest that Fin1 is a PP1 regulatory subunit whose spatial and temporal activity must be precisely controlled to ensure genomic stability.

Quantitative comparison of high-resolution MRI and myelin-stained histology of the human cerebral cortex. The architectonic analysis of the human cerebral cortex is presently based on the examination of stained tissue sections. Recent progress in high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) promotes the feasibility of an in vivo architectonic analysis. Since the exact relationship between the laminar fine-structure of a cortical MRI signal and histological cyto-and myeloarchitectonic staining patterns is not known, a quantitative study comparing high-resolution MRI to histological ground truth images is necessary for validating a future MRI based architectonic analysis. This communication describes an ongoing study comparing post mortem MR images to a myelin-stained histology of the brain cortex. After establishing a close spatial correspondence between histological sections and MRI using a slice-to-volume nonrigid registration algorithm, transcortical intensity profiles, extracted from both imaging modalities along curved trajectories of a Laplacian vector field, are compared via a cross-correlational analysis.


Geographic disparities in access to the medical home among US CSHCN.

Hospitalizations for coccidioidomycosis at forty-one children's hospitals in the United States. Coccidioidomycosis is often a self-limiting pulmonary infection, but it can cause more clinically apparent disease leading to hospitalization. We describe the characteristics of initial and subsequent hospitalizations in children with coccidioidomycosis. Using the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS), an inpatient database, we identified retrospectively a cohort of patients hospitalized between April 1, 2002 and June 30, 2007 at children's hospitals across the United States. Demographic, clinical, and therapeutic data for the initial and subsequent hospitalizations were collected and analyzed. We identified 199 children who had 295 hospitalizations for coccidioidomycosis. The median hospital length of stay was 7 days (interquartile range: 3-14 days). Hospital incidence rates were stable from 2003 to 2005 but increased significantly from 2005 to 2006 (8.31/100,000 discharges vs. 12.95/100,000 discharges; chi2 = 4.65, P = 0.031). Fluconazole was the most commonly used antifungal agent, but 17.1% of patients were initially managed without antifungal therapy. The presence of an underlying comorbid condition was common (34.2%) as was the need for surgical intervention (41%). In-hospital mortality was low (1.5%). The increase in hospitalization rates associated with coccidioidomycosis from 2005 to 2006 mirrors the increase in cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention during the same time period. Hospital admission for coccidioidomycosis seems to be more common in patients with underlying comorbid conditions and frequently necessitates surgical intervention.


Changes of coagulation parameters during high altitude expedition.

Binocular interaction in post-LASIK subjects with unsatisfactory outcome. A shift from binocular summation to binocular inhibition has been observed when there is a significant decrease in contrast sensitivity or reduced retinal illuminance in one eye compared to the other as in cases of unilateral cataract and amblyopia. This study aims to determine how binocular function in post-LASIK subjects with unsatisfactory outcomes is influenced by differences between the two eyes in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. A retrospective analysis of monocular and binocular visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS) results was performed for 23 LASIK subjects who previously underwent a Functional Vision Test battery at Vision Sciences Research Corp. (San Ramon, CA). Photopic VA was measured with ETDRS chart and sine-wave grating CS was measured with FACT chart. The difference between binocular and better monocular VA and CS was calculated for each subject and referred to as binocular difference. The interocular difference was calculated as better eye-worse eye for VA and CS. Significant negative correlations (P < 0.01) were observed between binocular difference and interocular difference for VA (r = -0.84) and CS at each spatial frequency of 1.5 (r = -0.90), 3 (r = -0.85), 6 (r = -0.79), 12 (r = -0.68), and 18c/d (r = -0.72). The greater the difference between the eyes, the lesser the binocular summation. Linear regression predicted a 1-line decrease in binocular summation for a 4-line increase in interocular acuity difference and a 35% decrease in binocular summation for a 50% increase in interocular difference of contrast sensitivity at 3c/d (ANOVA, P < 0.01). Binocular inhibition in post-LASIK subjects increases as the visual sensitivity difference between the two eyes increases. Since the peak of human contrast sensitivity function is at the middle spatial frequencies, the decrease in binocular CS at 3c/d due to reduced CS in one eye is functionally significant.

Pesticide Use and Relative Leukocyte Telomere Length in the Agricultural Health Study.

Drug metabolism for the perplexed medicinal chemist. Two related and significant issues may elicit perplexity in medicinal chemists and are discussed here. First, a broad presentation of the pharmacological and toxicological consequences of drug metabolism should justify the significance of drug metabolism and serve as an incentive to further study. When comparing the pharmacological activities of a drug and its metabolite(s), a continuum is found which ranges from soft drugs (no active metabolites) to prodrugs (inactive per se, as illustrated here with clopidogrel and prasugrel). Innumerable intermediate cases document drugs whose activity is shared by one or more metabolites, as exemplified with tamoxifen. The toxicological consequences of metabolism at the molecular, macromolecular, and macroscopic levels are manyfold. A brief overview is offered together with a summary of the reactions of toxification and detoxification of the antiepileptic valproic acid. The second issue discussed in the review is a comparison of the relative significance of cytochromes P450 and other oxidoreductases (EC 1), hydrolases (EC 3), and transferases (EC 2) in drug metabolism, based on a 'guesstimate' of the number of drug metabolites that are known to be produced by them. The conclusion is that oxidoreductases are the main enzymes responsible for the formation of toxic or active metabolites, whereas transferases play the major role in producing inactive and nontoxic metabolites.

Endothelial progenitor cell senescence--is there a role for estrogen?

Transitions in the functional status of disabled community-living older adults over a 3-year follow-up period. The purpose of this study was to investigate transitions over time in the functional status of disabled community-living elderly. The study explored clinical and socio-demographic predictors of functional status decline. Data from the SIPA 3-year longitudinal study were analyzed (n=1164). Three categories of functional status were defined: no important disability, significant IADL disability and significant ADL disability. At baseline, results show that the prevalence rates were 26.9%, 58.6% and 14.5% for the three categories of functional status. After 12 months, about 50-60% of participants had remained in the same status, while some 10-15% of those with baseline significant disability had improved. The patterns of transitions between 12 and 36 months of follow-up were slightly different. The results indicated more deterioration (13-38%) and less improvement (6-9%). After controlling for baseline functional status, the best predictors for functional decline at 36 months were prior disability, functional limitations, cognitive impairment and comorbidity burden. We found that older adults' functional status may decline or improve even if the participants are disabled. Disabled conditions play a crucial role in the development of future disability and preventive actions need to be implemented.

Molecular architecture of Streptococcus pneumoniae TIGR4 pili. Although the pili of Gram-positive bacteria are putative virulence factors, little is known about their structure. Here we describe the molecular architecture of pilus-1 of Streptococcus pneumoniae, which is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. One major (RrgB) and two minor components (RrgA and RrgC) assemble into the pilus. Results from TEM and scanning transmission EM show that the native pili are approximately 6 nm wide, flexible filaments that can be over 1 microm long. They are formed by a single string of RrgB monomers and have a polarity defined by nose-like protrusions. These protrusions correlate to the shape of monomeric RrgB-His, which like RrgA-His and RrgC-His has an elongated, multi-domain structure. RrgA and RrgC are only present at the opposite ends of the pilus shaft, compatible with their putative roles as adhesin and anchor to the cell wall surface, respectively. Our structural analyses provide the first direct experimental evidence that the native S. pneumoniae pilus shaft is composed exclusively of covalently linked monomeric RrgB subunits oriented head-to-tail.

Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause in Breast Cancer Survivors: Are We Facing New and Safe Hopes? Breast cancer survivors (BCSs) often suffer from menopausal symptoms induced by systemic treatments, with a consequent negative effect on quality of life. Since the introduction of aromatase inhibitors as the standard therapy for hormone-dependent tumors, genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM) has become a main problem for BCSs. This new terminology refers to the wide range of vaginal and urinary symptoms related to menopause, which can be relieved by estrogen therapy. Unfortunately, systemic hormone therapy is contraindicated for BCSs and also vaginal estrogens at standard dosage might influence the risk of recurrence because they cause a significant increase of circulating estrogens. Nonhormonal vaginal moisturizers or lubricants are the first choice for BCSs but only have limited and short-term efficacy. New strategies of management of GSM are now available, including: (1) low-dose or ultra low-dose vaginal estrogens; (2) oral selective estrogen receptor modulators (ospemifene); (3) androgen therapy; (4) physical treatment with vaginal laser; and (5) psychosocial interventions. In this review we discuss and analyze these different options. 

24 h Accelerometry: impact of sleep-screening methods on estimates of sedentary behaviour and physical activity while awake. Although accelerometers can assess sleep and activity over 24Â h, sleep data must be removed before physical activity and sedentary time can be examined appropriately. We compared the effect of 6 different sleep-scoring rules on physical activity and sedentary time. Activity and sleep were obtained by accelerometry (ActiGraph GT3X) over 7Â days in 291 children (51.3% overweight or obese) aged 4-8.9Â years. Three methods removed sleep using individualised time filters and two methods applied standard time filters to remove sleep each day (9 pm-6 am, 12 am-6 am). The final method did not remove sleep but simply defined non-wear as at least 60Â min of consecutive zeros over the 24-h period. Different methods of removing sleep from 24-h data markedly affect estimates of sedentary time, yielding values ranging from 556 to 1145Â min/day. Estimates of non-wear time (33-193Â min), wear time (736-1337Â min) and counts per minute (384-658) also showed considerable variation. By contrast, estimates of moderate-to-vigorous activity (MVPA) were similar, varying by less than 1Â min/day. Different scoring methods to remove sleep from 24-h accelerometry data do not affect measures of MVPA, whereas estimates of counts per minute and sedentary time depend considerably on which technique is used. 


Monitoring protein interactions and dynamics with solvatochromic fluorophores.

A 1,8-naphthyridone derivative targets the HIV-1 Tat-mediated transcription and potently inhibits the HIV-1 replication. The emergence of multidrug resistant HIV-1 strains and the inability of the HAART to eradicate HIV-1 virus from infected patients demand new drugs able to interfere with an alternative step of the replicative cycle. The naphthyridone 3 (HM13N), described in the present study, is a promising anti-HIV agent due to its ability to inhibit the HIV-1 Tat-mediated transcription and the potent antiviral activity observed in acutely, chronically, and latently infected cells. The absence of any tendency to select for resistance mutations in vitro adds to the potential clinical value of this type of compounds, especially as these compounds are drug-like and obey the Lipinski rules.

Differential effects of Ydj1 and Sis1 on Hsp70-mediated clearance of stress granules in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Stress granules and P-bodies are conserved assemblies of nontranslating mRNAs in eukaryotic cells that can be related to RNA-protein aggregates found in some neurodegenerative diseases. Herein, we examine how the Hsp70/Hsp40 protein chaperones affected the assembly and disassembly of stress granules and P-bodies in yeast. We observed that Hsp70 and the Ydj1 and Sis1 Hsp40 proteins accumulated in stress granules and defects in these proteins led to decreases in the disassembly and/or clearance of stress granules. We observed that individual Hsp40 proteins have different effects on stress granules with defects in Ydj1 leading to accumulation of stress granules in the vacuole and limited recovery of translation following stress, which suggests that Ydj1 promotes disassembly of stress granules to promote translation. In contrast, defects in Sis1 did not affect recovery of translation, accumulated cytoplasmic stress granules, and showed reductions in the targeting of stress granules to the vacuole. This demonstrates a new principle whereby alternative disassembly machineries lead to different fates of components within stress granules, thereby providing additional avenues for regulation of their assembly, composition, and function. Moreover, a role for Hsp70 and Hsp40 proteins in stress granule disassembly couples the assembly of these stress responsive structures to the proteostatic state of the cell.

Fertility of male survivors of childhood cancer: a report from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. This study was undertaken to determine the effect of treatment for childhood cancer on male fertility. We reviewed the fertility of male Childhood Cancer Survivor Study survivor and sibling cohorts who completed a questionnaire. We abstracted the chemotherapeutic agents administered, the cumulative dose of drug administered for selected drugs, and the doses and volumes of all radiation therapy from medical records. Risk factors for siring a pregnancy were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models. The 6,224 survivors age 15 to 44 years who were not surgically sterile were less likely to sire a pregnancy than siblings (hazard ratio [HR], 0.56; 95% CI, -0.49 to 0.63). Among survivors, the HR of siring a pregnancy was decreased by radiation therapy of more than 7.5 Gy to the testes (HR, 0.12; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.64), higher cumulative alkylating agent dose (AAD) score or treatment with cyclophosphamide (third tertile HR, 0.42; 95% CI, -0.31 to 0.57) or procarbazine (second tertile HR, 0.48; 95% CI, -0.26 to 0.87; third tertile HR, 0.17; 95% CI, -0.07 to 0.41). Compared with siblings, the HR for ever siring a pregnancy for survivors who had an AAD score = 0, a hypothalamic/pituitary radiation dose = 0 Gy, and a testes radiation dose = 0 Gy was 0.91 (95% CI, 0.73 to 1.14; P = .41). This large study identified risk factors for decreased fertility that may be used for counseling male cancer patients.

The influence of orthotic gait training with an isocentric reciprocating gait orthosis on the walking ability of paraplegic patients: a pilot study. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of walking with an isocentric reciprocating gait orthosis (IRGO) by spinal cord injury (SCI) patients on walking speed, distance walked and energy consumption whilst participating in a 12-week gait re-training program. Six people with motor complete SCI (mean age 29 years, weight 63âkg and height 160âcm with injury levels ranging from T8 to T12) participated in this study. Gait evaluation was performed at baseline and after 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Walking speed and heart rate were measured to calculate the resulting physiological cost index (PCI). Reductions in energy consumption were observed after 4, 8 and 12 weeks compared with baseline but were not significant. However, walking distance increased significantly (P=0.010, P=0.003 and P=0.005, respectively) and also did so during the 8-12-week period (P=0.013). Walking speed also improved, but not significantly. Intensive gait training with the IRGO improved walking speed and the distance walked by paraplegics, as well as reducing the PCI of walking, as compared with baseline during the whole 12-week period. This indicates that further improvements in these parameters may be expected when utilizing gait training longer than 8 weeks.

Comparative morphology of the oocyte surface and early development in four characiformes from the SÃ£o Francisco River, Brazil. Early development from the egg fertilization to complete resorption of the yolk-sac is a critical period in the life cycle of teleost fish. Knowledge of this process provides essential parameters for aquaculture and identification of spawning sites in the wild. In the present study, a comparative morphological analysis of the oocyte surface as well as early development was performed in four commercially valuable species from the SÃ£o Francisco River: Brycon orthotaenia, Leporinus obtusidens, Prochilodus argenteus, and Salminus franciscanus. Stripped oocytes, embryo, and yolk-sac larvae were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and histology. A set of 10 lectins was used for investigation of lectin-binding pattern in oocytes. In the four species, the outer layer of the zona radiata reacted to most lectins, indicating complex polysaccharides at the oocyte surface while no reactivity was detected in the inner zona radiata and yolk globules. Typical structural arrangements were recognized at the micropylar region by SEM. The four species showed nonadhesive eggs, short embryonic period (18-20 h at 24âÂ±â1Â°C), and poorly developed larvae at hatching. At 24 h posthatching (hph), larvae of the four species had neuromasts on the body surface. Rudimentary cement glands for larval attachment were identified on the cephalic region at 24 and 48 hph in B. orthotaenia and S. franciscanus, and following they were in regression. The time for whole yolk resorption varied among species from 48 to 120 hph, occurring earlier in S. franciscanus, followed by B. orthotaenia, P. argenteus, and L. obtusidens. The formation of the digestive tract and the mouth opening indicated initiation of exogenous feeding 24 h before complete resorption of the yolk. Together, our data indicate similarities in the early development among species that may be related to the life cycle strategies and phylogeny.

Systemic and cerebral hemodynamics during the transitional period after premature birth. Little is known about the effect on clinically relevant outcomes of the complex hemodynamic changes occurring during adaptation to extrauterine life in preterm neonates, particularly in very low birth weight neonates. As cardiovascular adaptation in this extremely vulnerable patient population is complicated by immaturity of all organ systems, especially that of the cardiorespiratory, central nervous, and endocrine systems, maladaptation has been suspected, but not necessarily proven, to contribute to mortality and long-term morbidities. This article describes recent advances in the understanding of hemodynamic changes in very low birth weight neonates during postnatal transition, and reviews the complex and developmentally regulated interaction between systemic and cerebral hemodynamics and the effect of this interaction on clinically relevant outcomes.

Traditional and novel aspects of the metabolic actions of growth hormone. Growth hormone has been known to be diabetogenic for almost a century and it's diabetogenic properties fostered consideration of excessive and abnormal GH secretion as a cause of diabetes, as well as a role in the microvascular complications, especially retinopathy. However, besides inducing insulin resistance, GH also is lipolytic and a major anabolic hormone for nitrogen retention and protein synthesis. These actions are best illustrated at the extremes of GH secretion: Gigantism/acromegaly is characterized by excessive growth, CHO intolerance, hyperplasia of bone, little body fat and prominent muscle development, whereas total deficiency of GH secretion or action is associated with adiposity, poor growth, and poor muscle development. These actions also become apparent during puberty and pregnancy, times when GH secretion is increased and account for the characteristic changes in body composition and tendency to diabetes. More recently, tissue specific deletions of the GH receptor (GHR), have uncovered newer metabolic effects including it's essential role in triglyceride export from the liver when GHR is deleted in the liver, leading to hepatic steatosis and ultimately to hepatic adenoma formation, effects which may explain these findings in obesity, a state of diminished GH secretion and action. In addition deletion of GH action in muscle and fat is associated with specific patterns of disturbed phenotype and metabolic effects in CHO, fat, and protein metabolism affecting the specific tissue and whole body function. This chapter provides an overview of these classic and newer metabolic functions of GH, placing this hormone and its actions in a central role of body fuel economy in health and disease.

Mechanisms of multidrug resistance in cancer. The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) to chemotherapy remains a major challenge in the treatment of cancer. Resistance exists against every effective anticancer drug and can develop by numerous mechanisms including decreased drug uptake, increased drug efflux, activation of detoxifying systems, activation of DNA repair mechanisms, evasion of drug-induced apoptosis, etc. In the first part of this chapter, we briefly summarize the current knowledge on individual cellular mechanisms responsible for MDR, with a special emphasis on ATP-binding cassette transporters, perhaps the main theme of this textbook. Although extensive work has been done to characterize MDR mechanisms in vitro, the translation of this knowledge to the clinic has not been crowned with success. Therefore, identifying genes and mechanisms critical to the development of MDR in vivo and establishing a reliable method for analyzing clinical samples could help to predict the development of resistance and lead to treatments designed to circumvent it. Our thoughts about translational research needed to achieve significant progress in the understanding of this complex phenomenon are therefore discussed in a third section. The pleotropic response of cancer cells to chemotherapy is summarized in a concluding diagram.

A painful metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty: a diagnostic dilemma. Infection, loosening, osteolysis, or other causes can lead to the development of pain about a previously well-functioning total hip arthroplasty. An inflammatory reaction unique to metal on metal arthroplasty can lead to a painful total hip. A synovial biopsy is needed to make this specific diagnosis, and included in the differential diagnosis is infection. The workup of infection includes obtaining a C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Elevations of both the C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are felt to indicate possible infection. This case report describes both of these findings and the treatment rendered in a painful subluxing metal-on-metal total hip arthroplasty presenting with ongoing pain and a large effusion.

Image-guided thermochemical ablation: theoretical and practical considerations.

Silica-volatile interaction and the geological cause of the Xuan Wei lung cancer epidemic. Parts of Xuan Wei County, Yunnan Province, China have the highest known lung cancer mortality in nonsmoking women. This high mortality displays a clear spatial relationship to the mines producing coal from the uppermost Permian. Geochemical, petrographic, and grainsize analyses were undertaken on a set of coal samples from Xuan Wei. Results demonstrate that the single geochemical property that makes this coal unusual is its high concentration of quartz (13.5 wt %) of which 35-55% occurs as <10 microm grains. We propose the potential for silica-volatile interaction (PSVI) as a new method for assessing the combined influence of silica and volatile organic matter and use this as a basis for re-evaluating existing ecological data. Published lung cancer mortality values are more strongly correlated with PSVI values for Xuan Wei coal than with volatiles or silica alone and the PSVI values measured are distinct from those of other coals. Finally we propose that the localization of this epidemic to Xuan Wei results from enhanced weathering of the local Emeishan basalts as a consequence of geochemical perturbations at the Permo-Triassic Boundary.

Hemoperfusion with an immobilized polymyxin B fiber column decreases macrophage and monocyte activity. We investigated whether direct hemoperfusion with a polymyxin B column (DHP-PMX) was able to decrease macrophage and monocyte activity in patients with sepsis. Nineteen patients with sepsis were enrolled in the study. They all had signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) due to infection and a mean arterial blood pressure > or =65 mm Hg (irrespective of the use of catecholamines). A thermodilution catheter was inserted prior to DHP-PMX for intravenous infusion, and DHP-PMX was performed twice within 24 h for 3 h each time. Serum neopterin was measured four times: before DHP-PMX, and 24, 48, 72 h after it had begun. The serum concentrations of neopterin were 654 +/- 234 nmol/L prior to DHP-PMX vs. 573 +/- 196 nmol/L at 24 h, 452 +/- 161 nmol/L at 48 h, and 372 +/- 139 nmol/L at 72 h, showing a significant decrease from 48 h onwards compared with before treatment. These data suggest that DHP-PMX decreases macrophage and monocyte activity.

Family influence on volunteering intention and behavior among Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong. Based on the responses of 5,946 adolescents (mean age = 14.77), the relationships among family influence, adolescents' volunteering intention, and volunteering behavior in a Chinese context were examined. A 9-item Chinese Family Influence on Adolescent Volunteerism Scale (C-FIAV) was used to measure nine kinds of influence of the family (such as family support) which could be subsumed under two underlying domains (positive family influence and extrinsic family influence). Results showed that family support, family belief, and family modeling were positively associated with both intention and behavior. Family reward and coercion were negatively associated with both intention and behavior. Family belief in volunteerism was the most critical factor. Grade and gender differences were found only in the associations between family influence and volunteering intention. Path models showed that positive and extrinsic family influence had an effect on volunteering behavior directly or via the mediation of volunteering intention. Implications and limitations are discussed.

Effects of lidocaine hydrochloride on canine granulocytes, granulocyte CD11b expression and reactive oxygen species production. Lidocaine hydrochloride (Lido) is widely used for analgesia in veterinary medicine; however, in humans, it has been suggested that Lido attenuates granulocyte functions, such as adhesion and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Thus, Lido may affect canine granulocyte function; however, there have been no reports on the effects of Lido on canine granulocyte function. Thus, we studied the effects of Lido on canine granulocyte CD11b expression and ROS production. We further studied the effects of Lido on the priming of canine granulocyte CD11b expression and ROS production by recombinant canine granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (rcGM-CSF). Isolated granulocytes were incubated with 3, 30 or 300 microg/ml Lido, or with Lido followed by priming with 5 ng/ml rcGM-CSF. CD11b was detected by the immune fluorescent antibody method, and the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was assayed by flow cytometry. ROS production was assessed by the peak time (PT) of ROS production and area under the luminol reaction curve (AUC), which represents total ROS production quantity against opsonized zymosan stimuli. Only 300 microg/ml Lido (tissue level observed by regional block) significantly attenuated both the MFI of CD11b and its enhancement by rcGM-CSF. Moreover, at this concentration, the AUC and its enhancement by rcGM-CSF were significantly attenuated by Lido; in contrast, Lido did not affect PT. In conclusion, Lido suppressed granulocyte adhesion to the endothelium and antiseptic capability by suppressing CD11b expression and/or ROS production. Particular care should thus be exercised when performing regional anesthesia block using Lido.

The protective effect of selenoprotein P on injury in rat liver transplantation. Selenoprotein P (SeP), a plasma protein, is considered to have a protective effect against various organ damages. We investigated whether addition of SeP to storage solution could attenuate cold ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) in rat liver transplantation. After 24 hrs cold preservation in either University of Wisconsin (UW) solution with or without SeP (1 micromol/L or 10 micromol/L), the liver was flushed with warm lactated Ringer's solution. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level in the venous effluent was measured. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLTx) was then performed after the same preservation as above. Blood biochemical features and tissue lipid peroxide levels were measured after OLTx, and morphometric changes analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining. ALT levels in effluent in the SeP 10 group were significantly lower than those in other groups. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were significantly decreased in the SeP 10 group. Histological examinations showed amelioration of sinusoidal damage in the SeP 10 group at 1 hr after OLTx. Percentages of necrotic areas and apoptotic sinusoidal endothelial cells were decreased in the SeP 10 group. The addition of SeP to UW solution attenuates injury in OLTx.

A novel simulation model for minimally invasive spine surgery. Minimally invasive spine surgery (MISS) is among the fastest growing technologies in general neurosurgical practice. In addition, great demand exists to teach these skills to neurosurgery residents. With newly enforced work hour restrictions, opportunities to acquire these skills are limited, necessitating development of alternative strategies of education. We describe a novel simulation model for MISS supplemented by resident self-assessment analysis and evaluation. The simulator was constructed using a nontransparent Plexiglas frame supplemented with a modified halo frame on which to affix spine specimens. Interchangeable copper tubing was affixed to a 360-degree pivot system to replicate a working portal. Deer skulls and spines were then collected and prepared accordingly. Laboratory exercises were based on the resident's level of training with emphasis on proper drilling techniques. Eight neurosurgery residents were asked to complete the exercises and complete a self-assessment survey regarding their competence level on a scale of 0 to 5, both before and after completing the skill sets. Additionally, they were asked to complete an exit survey that was used to assess the simulation exercises. All exercises were completed successfully with the exception of placing 2 separate pedicle screws through the same portal, which posed difficulty on some specimens because of the of lack of lordosis of the specimens, leading to unfavorable trajectories using a free-hand technique. With regard to the resident self-assessment analysis, the mean confidence rating for performing an MISS laminectomy improved by a difference of 1.25 points (n = 8; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-1.84; P = 0.0015), from 2.50 to 3.75 before and after simulation exercises, respectively, and reached statistical significance. For the senior-level residents, the mean confidence rating for performing MISS placement of pedicle screws using a free-hand technique improved by a difference of 1.00 (n = 3; 95% confidence interval, -1.48-3.48; P = 0.225), from 3.33 to 4.33 before and after simulation exercises, respectively. Results of the exit survey were encouraging. The MISS simulator is a feasible, inexpensive, and reproducible adjunct to neurosurgery resident training and provides a new teaching method for spine surgery. Further investigation of this technology is warranted, although multicenter, randomized, controlled trials assessing its validity may not be practical because of ethical constraints with regard to patient safety.

Migration-induced variation of fatty acid transporters and cellular metabolic intensity in passerine birds. Because lipids are the main fuel supporting avian endurance activity, lipid transport and oxidation capacities may increase during migration. We measured enzyme activities, mRNA expression and protein levels in pectoralis and heart for several key steps of lipid transport and catabolism pathways to investigate whether these pathways were upregulated during migration. We used yellow-rumped (Setophaga coronata) and yellow (S. petechia) warblers and warbling vireos (Vireo gilvus) as study species because they all show migration-induced increases in organismal metabolic capacities. For yellow-rumped warblers, Î²-hydroxyacyl CoA-dehydrogenase (HOAD) activities and fatty acid transporter mRNA and/or protein levels were higher during spring than fall in pectoralis and heart, except that fatty acid translocase (FAT/CD36) protein levels showed the opposite pattern in heart. Lipid transporter protein levels, but not mRNA expression, in pectoralis and heart of warbling vireos were higher either during spring or fall than summer, but this was not true for HOAD activities. For yellow warblers, pectoralis, but not heart, protein levels of lipid transporters were upregulated during migration relative to summer, but this pattern was not evident for mRNA expression or HOAD activity. Finally, muscle and heart citrate synthase and carnitine palmitoyl transferase activities showed little seasonal variation for any species. These data suggest that pectoralis and heart lipid transport and catabolism capacities are often, but not universally, important correlates of elevated organismal metabolic capacity during migration. In contrast, migration-induced variation in cellular metabolic intensity and mitochondrial membrane transport are apparently not common correlates of the migratory phenotype in passerines.

Myofibroblasts reaction in urothelial carcinomas. The myofibroblast is a connective tissue cell with intermediate features between the fibroblast and the smooth muscle cell and unknown origin, which normally is present in only a few organs, but with increased incidence in malignancies. The patterns of myofibroblastic reaction may be synchronous, metachronous and mixed. The presence of the myofibroblasts has been demonstrated into the stroma of breast carcinomas, particularly in firm, retracted tumors with no inflammatory infiltrate. The present literature lacks data regarding the presence and the behavior of the myofibroblasts in urothelial carcinomas. Fifty-nine urothelial carcinoma specimens from patients admitted into the Urology Clinic of the Emergency County Hospital of Timisoara between 1999 and 2004 were stained with usual HE stain for the morphological diagnosis and immunohistochemically stained with smooth muscle actin, vimentin, and desmin for the detection of myofibroblasts. In biopsies sampled from normal urinary bladder and in urothelial carcinomas of the superior urinary tract Ta, we have not noticed any cells with myofibroblast morphology or immunophenotype. In Ta tumors, no matter the differentiation grade, we have not noticed myofibroblasts neither between the tumor cells nor at distance. The myofibroblasts were identified in seven of the 26 (26.92%) tumors in T1 stage. In T2 and T3 stage tumors the number of myofibroblasts differs from case to case, being significantly higher in tumors with high differentiation grade, G3.

What contributes to driving ability in Parkinson's disease. To determine the most significant clinical predictors that influence driving ability in Parkinson disease (PD). National-multi-centre, cross-sectional study covering PD outpatients. Clinical assessment was based on the following questionnaires: cognition (SCOPA-Cog); motor impairment and disabilities (SCOPA motor); depression/anxiety; sleep (SCOPA-Sleep); psychosis and severity/global impairment (HY and CISI-PD). Driving status data was obtained using a standardized questionnaire. Comparisons between drivers and ex-drivers were calculated using chi(2) and Student t-tests as appropriate. Multi-variate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent driving ability clinical predictors. Compared with the drivers, the ex-drivers were older (p = 0.00005), had longer disease duration (p = 0.03), had more overall cognitive dysfunction (p = 0.004) and had greater motor impairment, as measured by the CISI (p = 0.02), HY stage (p = 0.034) and by the SCOPA-motor scale (p = 0.002) and difficulty in activities of daily life (p = 0.002). In the regression model analysis, aging and ADL impairment were the principal clinical predictors that differentiated drivers from ex-drivers. Although overall driving impairment in PD is associated with advancing disease severity, driving ability seems to be more strongly influenced by age and ADL impairment. Multi-disciplinary teams are required to assess driving ability in patients with PD and develop rehabilitation measures for safer driving.

Venous Obstruction in Asymptomatic Patients Undergoing First Implantation or Revision of a Cardiac Pacemaker or Implantable Cardioverter-Defibrillator: A Retrospective Single Center Analysis. To investigate the incidence and possible risk factors of upper deep vein obstruction in patients both prior to first cardiac device implantation and before device revision. Records of asymptomatic patients undergoing contrast venography prior to implantation or revision of a cardiac device from 09/2009 to 04/2012 were reviewed. Venograms were used to determine the presence of venous obstruction. Interrelations between the incidence of venous obstruction and patient- or device-related parameters were identified using Fisher's exact test and univariate logistic regression. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of venous obstruction. 456 patients met the inclusion criteria (330 males, 126 females, 67.8 âÂ±â 12.9 years). 100 patients underwent first implantation, and 356 patients underwent device revision (mean time since implantation 82.5â Â± â75.3 months). Venous obstruction was present in 11.0â% and 30.1â% before implantation and revision, respectively. Only presence of ventricular escape rhythm was significantly related to venous occlusion (pâ<â0.001) prior to first implantation. Prior to revision, significant predictors were male sex (pâ=â0.01), time since implantation (pâ<â0.0001), presence of escape rhythm (pâ=â0.02), compromised coagulation (pâ=â0.02), phenprocoumon (pâ=â0.005), and peripheral arterial disease (pâ=â0.01). Although several risk factors could be identified, reliable prediction of venous obstruction was not possible. Therefore, we advocate performing venography in all patients prior to device revision or upgrade to avoid complications. In cases of first device implantation, the risks associated with venography should be weighed against the surprisingly high rate of deep upper vein obstruction.

Circulating chemokine levels in febrile infants with serious bacterial infections. Early diagnosis of serious bacterial infections (SBI) in febrile young infants based on clinical symptoms and signs is difficult. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic values of circulating chemokines and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in febrile young infants < 3 months of age with suspected SBI. We enrolled 43 febrile young infants < 3 months of age with clinically suspected SBI who were admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit or complete nursing unit of the pediatric department of Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital between December 2006 and July 2007. Blood was drawn from the patients at admission, and complete blood counts, plasma levels of CRP, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), and chemokines, including interleukin-8 (IL-8), macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta, monokine induced by interferon-gamma, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 were measured. Patients symptoms and signs, length of hospital stay, main diagnosis, and results of routine blood tests and microbiological culture results were recorded. Twenty-six infants (60.5%) were diagnosed with SBI, while 17 (39.5%) had no evidence of SBI based on the results of bacterial cultures. CRP, IL-8 and G-CSF levels were significantly higher in the infants with SBI than in those without SBI Plasma levels of other chemokines were not significantly different between the groups. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve for differentiating between the presence and absence of SBI was 0.79 for CRP level. Diagnostic accuracy was further improved by combining CRP and IL-8, when the area under the ROC curve increased to 0.91. CRP levels were superior to IL-8 and G-CSF levels for predicting SBI in febrile infants at initial survey. IL-8 levels could be used as an additional diagnostic tool in the initial evaluation of febrile young infants, allowing clinicians to treat these patients more appropriately.

The use of antiviral agents for the management of severe influenza. The clinical course of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza can be severe, particularly in the very young and patients with comorbidities. Pandemic H1N1 2009 is sensitive to the antiviral agents oseltamivir and zanamivir but is resistant to the M2 inhibitors. Although few clinical data are yet available, treatment of pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza in hospital settings with oseltamivir or zanamivir appears to be beneficial. In hospitalized patients with severe influenza treated with oseltamivir, mortality and length of stay are significantly reduced, and viral load is reduced more quickly than in untreated patients. In patients at high risk treated with oseltamivir or zanamivir, reductions in the risk of complications and mortality after treatment have been demonstrated with oseltamivir and zanamivir, although there are fewer data on the latter. There is no evidence yet that other antiviral agents are effective in severe or pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza. Current World Health Organization guidance strongly recommends the use of oseltamivir for severe or progressive infection with pandemic H1N1 2009, with zanamivir as an alternative if the infecting virus is oseltamivir-resistant. Very little resistance to oseltamivir has been found to date.

A case of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome with breast cancer, bilateral sex cord tumor with annular tubules, and adenoma malignum caused by STK11 gene mutation. Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder, and women with this syndrome are at an increased risk of developing intestinal and extraintestinal malignancies including breast and gynecologic malignancies. This case report presents a patient with PJS with a concomitant breast cancer, bilateral stromal tumors with annular tubules of the ovaries, and adenoma malignum of the cervix. A 43-year-old woman presented with an advanced-stage breast cancer and a pelvic mass. The patient was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by laparotomy with a hysterectomy and oophorectomy. Final pathologic examination revealed a concomitant breast cancer with metastasis to the ovaries, bilateral stromal tumors with annular tubules of the ovaries, and adenoma malignum of the cervix. Patients with PJS are at a high risk for intestinal and extraintestinal malignancies and can present with multiple concomitant malignancies.

pxn-1 and pxn-2 May Interact Negatively during Neuronal Development and Aging in C. elegans. C. elegans has two functional peroxidasins (PXN), PXN-1 and PXN-2. PXN-2 is essential to consolidate the extracellular matrix during development and is suggested to interact with PXN-1 antagonistically. pxn-1 is involved in neuronal development and possibly maintenance; therefore, we investigated the relationship between pxn-1 and pxn-2 in neuronal development and in aging. During neuronal development, defects caused by pxn-1 overexpression were suppressed by overexpression of both pxn-1 and pxn-2. In neuronal aging process, pxn-1 mutants showed less age-related neuronal defects, such as neuronal outgrowth, neuronal wavy processes, and enhanced short-term memory performance. In addition, pxn-2 overexpressing animals retained an intact neuronal morphology when compared with age-matched controls. Consistent with these results, overexpression of both pxn-1 and pxn-2 restored the severe neuronal defects present with pxn-1 overexpression. These results implied that there is a negative relationship between pxn-1 and pxn-2 via pxn-1 regulating pxn-2. Therefore, pxn-1 may function in neuronal development and age-related neuronal maintenance through pxn-2. 

The preparation of silver nanoparticle decorated silica nanowires on fused quartz as reusable versatile nanostructured surface-enhanced Raman scattering substrates. We introduce a platform, comprised of silver nanoparticle decorated silica nanowires (SiONWs) dispersed on fused quartz substrates, for high sensitivity surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) measurements using both frontal (through the analytes) and back-face (through the transparent substrate) excitation. Quasi-quantitative SERS performances on the specialized substrate, vis-Ã -vis a silver deposited bare fused quartz plate, showed: (i) the suitability of the Ag modified SiONW substrate for frontal as well as back-face excitation; (ii) a wider detection range with high sensitivity to Rhodamine 6G; and (iii) good underwater metal-oxide adhesion of the specialized substrates. Capable of surviving ultrasonic cleaning, the substrate introduced is one of the few reusable low-cost Ag-based nanostructured SERS substrates, requiring only a simple silver reload process (the silver mirror reaction).

Enterocyte Damage: A Piece in the Puzzle of Post-Cardiac Arrest Syndrome. Cardiac arrest is considered to be a cause of small bowel ischemia, but the consequences of cardiac arrest on the human small bowel have been rarely studied. Plasma citrulline concentration is a marker of functional enterocyte mass, and plasma intestinal fatty acid-binding protein (I-FABP) concentration is a marker of enterocyte damage. We aimed to measure enterocyte biomarkers after cardiac arrest and to study the prognostic value of biomarker abnormalities. This is a prospective, observational, single-center study of patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for cardiac arrest, evaluating plasma citrulline and I-FABP concentrations at admission and after 24 âh and variables according to the Utstein criteria. Variables according to 28-day Cerebral Performance Category score of 1 to 2 (good neurological outcome) versus 3 to 5 (poor neurological outcome) were compared. Sixty-nine patients with cardiac arrest of both cardiac and hypoxic origin were included. At ICU admission, plasma citrulline concentration was low in 65% and plasma I-FABP was elevated in 82% of the patients. After 24 âh, plasma citrulline was low in 82% and I-FABP was normal in 60% of the patients. Patients with a poor neurological outcome had a lower plasma citrulline concentration and a higher I-FABP concentration at ICU admission. By multivariate analysis, plasma citrulline levels of 13.1 âÎ¼mol L or less and I-FABP more than 260 âpg mL were independently associated with a poor neurological outcome (odds ratio, 21.9 [2.2-215], and odds ratio, 13.6 [1.4-129], respectively). Cardiac arrest resuscitation is associated with evidence of small bowel mucosal damage in most patients, with a short and intense I-FABP elevation at admission and a decrease in citrulline concentration during the first day. In this study, low plasma citrulline and high I-FABP concentrations at ICU admission were predictive of a poor neurological outcome. This study confirms that cardiac arrest is a model of small bowel mucosal ischemia and suggests that enterocyte damage is a piece in the puzzle of post-cardiac arrest syndrome.

Genetic and environmental contributions to depression in Sri Lanka. Susceptibility to depression results from genetic and non-familially shared environmental influences in high-income, Western countries. Environments may play a different role for populations in different contexts. To examine heritability of depression in the first large, population-based twin study in a low-income country. Lifetime depression and a broader measure of depression susceptibility (D-probe) were assessed in 3908 adult twins in Sri Lanka (the CoTASS study). There were gender differences for the broad definition (D-probe), with a higher genetic contribution in females (61%) than males (4%). Results were similar for depression, but the prevalence was too low to estimate heritability for males. Genetic influences on depression in women appear to be at least as strong in this Sri Lankan sample as in higher-income countries. Conclusions are less clear for men but suggest a larger role for environments rather than genes. The nature as well as the magnitude of environmental influences may also differ across populations.

[Experimental study on biomechanical properties of porcine trachea]. This is a study to evaluate the biomechanical properties of porcine trachea; the intention is to provide experimental methods as well as evidence for further studies on human trachea and artificial trachea. In the current study, the biomechanical indices such as bending stiffness, radial pedestal and stress-straining, bursting strength, and residual stress were adopted. The findings were as follows: there is residual stress in the trachea; when the 50mm trachea is compressed 50%, the force of radial pedestal is about 10N; the force of break from cricoid to eminence is from 180mmHg to 110mmHg. Meanwhile, the data of bent are gained and the curve of stress-straining is depicted. Rresidual stress exists in porcine trachea, and trachea membrane disrupts with the increasing of endotracheal pressure; meanwhile, the porcine trachea possesses fine properties such as radial pedestal, bending and elongation.


Effect of a plant stanol ester-containing spread, placebo spread, or Mediterranean diet on estimated cardiovascular risk and lipid, inflammatory and haemostatic factors.

Alendronate reduces osteoclast precursors in osteoporosis. This study evaluates the effect of alendronate on osteoclastogenesis, cytokine production, and bone resorption in postmenopausal women. We suggest that it acts on mature bone resorbing osteoclasts after 3 months of treatment, whereas, after 1 year, it diminishes their formation by reducing their precursors and serum RANKL. Osteoclasts are the target cells of bisphosphonates, though the most drug-sensitive steps of their formation and activity have not been determined. The present study evaluates the effect of alendronate on osteoclastogenesis, cytokine production, and bone resorption in postmenopausal women. The study was conducted on 35 osteoporotic women; 15 were pretreated with alendronate 70 mg/week, whereas, 20 were treated with calcium 1 g/day and vitamin D 800 IU/day. After 3 months, 30 received alendonate 70/mg, vitamin D 2800 IU/week, and calcium 1 g/day for 12 months (combined therapy), whereas, the other five patients remained on calcium 1 g/day and vitamin D 800 IU/day. The following parameters were assessed before and after therapy: changes in bone resorption markers, circulating osteoclast precursors, formation of osteoclasts in peripheral blood mononuclear cell cultures, their viability, and variations in cytokines production. After 3 months of alendronate, there was no significant reduction in the number of osteoclast precursors, osteoclast formation and viability, and cytokine levels, whereas, there was a significant reduction of bone resorption markers. One year of the combined therapy, on the other hand, reduced osteoclast precursors, osteoclast formation, and serum RANKL, whereas, calcium plus vitamin D alone had no effect. We suggest that alendronate mainly acts on mature bone resorbing osteoclasts in the short term, whereas, its long-term administration diminishes their formation by reducing their precursors and serum RANKL.

Public health and bovine tuberculosis: what's all the fuss about?

Switching associations between facial identity and emotional expression: a behavioural and ERP study. The aim of this study was to determine if, and when, the neural processes involved in switching associations formed with angry and happy faces start to diverge. We measured event-related potentials (ERPs) and behavioural responses while participants performed a reversal learning task with angry and happy faces. In the task, participants were simultaneously presented with two neutral faces and learned to associate one of the faces with an emotional expression (either angry or happy), which was displayed by the face when correctly selected. After three to seven trials, the face that had consistently been displaying an emotional expression when selected would instead remain neutral, signalling the participant to switch their response and select the other face on the subsequent trial. The neural processes involved in switching associations formed with angry and happy faces diverged 375 ms after stimulus onset. Specifically, P3a amplitude was reduced and P3b latency was delayed when participants were cued to switch associations formed with angry expressions compared to happy expressions. This difference was also evident in later behavioural responses, which showed that it was more difficult to switch associations made with angry expressions than happy expressions. These findings may reflect an adaptive mechanism that facilitates the maintenance of our memory of threatening individuals by associating them with their potential threat.

Rhizobacteria containing ACC-deaminase confer salt tolerance in maize grown on salt-affected fields. Salt stress is one of the major constraints hampering agricultural production owing to its impact on ethylene production and nutritional imbalance. A check on the accelerated ethylene production in plants could be helpful in minimizing the negative effect of salt stress on plant growth and development. Four Pseudomonas, 1 Flavobacterium, and 1 Enterobacter strain of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria containing 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC)-deaminase were selected and their effects on growth and yield of maize were investigated to improve the salt tolerance of maize grown on salt-affected fields. The selected rhizobacterial isolates reduced or eliminated the classical "triple" response, indicating their ability to reduce stress-induced ethylene levels. Results showed that rhizobacterial strains, particularly Pseudomonas and Enterobacter spp., significantly promoted the growth and yield of maize compared with the non-inoculated control. Pseudomonas fluorescens increased plant height, biomass, cob yield, grain yield, 1000 grain mass, and straw yield of maize up to 29%, 127%, 67%, 60%, 17%, and 166%, respectively, over the control. Under stress conditions, more N, P, and K uptake and high K+-Na+ ratios were recorded in inoculated plants compared with the control. The results imply that inoculation with plant growth promoting rhizobacteria containing ACC-deaminase could be a useful approach for improving growth and yield of maize under salt-stressed conditions.

Sphingobium vulgare sp. nov., isolated from freshwater sediment. A Gram-negative, motile, non-spore-forming bacterial strain, designated HU1-GD12(T), was isolated from freshwater sediment. The strain was characterized by using a polyphasic approach in order to determine its taxonomic position. Comparative analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that the isolate constituted a distinct branch within the genus Sphingobium, showing the highest level of sequence similarity with respect to Sphingobium ummariense RL-3(T) (96.2â%). Strain HU1-GD12(T) had a genomic DNA G+C content of 66.8 mol% and Q-10 as the predominant respiratory quinone. Furthermore, the major polyamine component (spermidine) in the cytoplasm and the presence of sphingoglycolipids suggested that strain HU1-GD12(T) belonged to the family Sphingomonadaceae. On the basis of its phenotypic properties and phylogenetic distinctiveness, strain HU1-GD12(T) represents a novel species of the genus Sphingobium, for which the name Sphingobium vulgare sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is HU1-GD12(T) (=LMG 24321(T)=KCTC 22289(T)).

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) mobilized and activated by neurotrophic factors may contribute to pathologic neovascularization in diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by pathological retinal neovascularization. Accumulating evidence has indicated that high levels of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are an important risk factor for neovascularization. Paradoxically, the reduction and dysfunction of circulating EPCs has been extensively reported in diabetic patients. We hypothesized that EPCs are differentially altered in the various vasculopathic complications of diabetes mellitus, exhibiting distinct behaviors in terms of angiogenic response to ischemia and growth factors and potentially playing a potent role in motivating vascular precursors to induce pathological neovascularization. Circulating levels of EPCs from diabetic retinopathy patients were analyzed by flow cytometry and by counting EPC colony-forming units, and serum levels of neurotrophic factors were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We found increased levels of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the blood of diabetic retinopathy patients; this increase was correlated with the levels of circulating EPCs. In addition, we demonstrated that retinal cells released neurotrophic factors under hypoxic conditions to enhance EPC activity in vitro and to increase angiogenesis in a mouse ischemic hindlimb model. These results suggest that neurotrophic factors may induce neoangiogenesis through EPC activation, leading to the pathological retinal neovascularization. Thus, we propose that neovascularization in the ischemic retina might be regulated by overexpression of neurotrophic factors.

Burden of fibromyalgia and comparisons with osteoarthritis in the workforce. To calculate the fibromyalgia (FM) burden of illness (BOI) from the employer perspective and to compare annual prevalence, work output, absence, and health benefit costs of employees with FM versus osteoarthritis (OA). Retrospective regression model analysis comparing objective work output, total health benefit (health care, prescription drug, sick leave, disability, workers' compensation) costs, and absence days for FM, versus OA and NoFM cohorts, while controlling for differences in patient characteristics. FM prevalence was 0.73%; OA 0.90%. Total health benefit costs for FM were $8452 versus $11,253 (P < 0.0001) for OA and $4013 (P < 0.0001) for NoFM, with BOI = $4439. Total absence days were 16.8 versus 19.8 (P < 0.0001) and 6.4 (P < 0.0001), respectively. FM had significantly lower annual work output than NoFM (19.5%, P = 0.003) but comparable with OA. FM places a significant cost, absence, and productivity burden on employers.

Effects of Different Doses of Nucleocapsid Protein from Hantaan Virus A9 Strain on Regulation of Interferon Signaling. Hantaan virus A9 strain (HTNV A9) is an etiologic agent of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in China. The virulence of the pathogenic hantaviruses is determined by their ability to alter key signaling pathways of early interferon (IFN) induction within cells. The potential role of HTNV A9 structural proteins, such as nucleocapsid (N) and envelope glycoproteins (Gn and Gc), in regulating human's innate antiviral immune response has not yet been clarified. In this study, we investigated the effect of HTNV A9âN protein on the regulation of the IFN pathway. We found that A9âN protein can influence the host innate immune response by regulating the activation of IFNÎ². The A9âN protein stimulates IFN response in low doses, whereas significantly inhibits IFNÎ² production at high doses. Furthermore, A9âN protein constitutively inhibits nuclear factor kappa B activation. A high dose of A9âN protein could inhibit either Poly IC-induced IFNÎ² or vesicular stomatitis virus-induced IFNÎ² and interferon-stimulated gene production. Our results indicate that HTNV A9âN protein helps virus establish successful infection by downregulating the IFN response and shed new light to the understanding of the interaction between the host innate immunity and virus during Hantaan virus infection. 

Effect and mechanism of acute graft versus host disease on early diffuse murine lung injury following allogeneic stem cell transplantation. To explore the effect and pathogenssis of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) on early diffuse lung injury in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), we established an aGVHD model of C(57)BL/6-->BALB/c mice. Chest computed tomography (CT) scans, histopathology and the levels of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and Interferon (IFNgamma) in lungs were dynamically detected in recipient mice after transplantation. The incidence of aGVHD was respectively 0%, 0% and 100% in simple irradiation group (A), syngeneic transplant group(B) and allogeneic transplant group (C). Chest CT scans of recipient mice were normal in 3 groups on days +3 and +7 after transplantation. CT showed that two of ten mice had bilateral lung diffuse infiltrate on day +12 (on the brink of death) in group A and 6 of 10 mice had bilateral lung diffuse infiltrate on day +14 (3 d after aGVHD occurring) in group C, and were normal on days +12 and +14 in group B after transplantation. Histopathology of lungs in the 3 groups was similar, consisting of minor interstitial pneumonitis on day +3. Group A showed edema, hyperplasia of epithelial cells and widened alveolar interval on day +7, and epithelial cell necrosis, lymphocyte infiltration, hemorrhage, protein leakage, and local consolidation on day +12. The histopathology of group B showed slight edema of epithelial cells on +7 day, which were slighter than that on day +3, and virtually normal on day +14. The histopathology in group C was characterized by the significant expansion and congestion of capillaries, and lymphocyte infiltration on day +7, the acute pneumonitis was present involving tissue edema, lymphocyte and macrophage infiltration, protein leakage and perivascular inflammation on day +14. In group A, the levels of TNFalpha were lower on day +7 than on day +3. In group B, the levels of TNFalpha attained a peak on day +3, which decreased on days +7 and +14. In group C, the levels of TNFalpha were highest on day +7 and there was a significant difference between those on days +7 and +14 (P=0.816). In group A, the levels of IFNgamma on day +7 were higher than on day +3. In group B, the levels of IFNgamma increased progressively, but the comparison of IFNgamma levels in different times had no statistical significance (P=0.521, 0.118, 0.340). In group C, the levels of IFNgamma attained a peak by day +7 and decreased on day +14. aGVHD is the main cause of early non-infectious lung injury. T lymphocytes and TNFalpha are possibly implicated in the pathogenesis of acute GVHD-induced lung injury. The decreased levels of IFNgamma in lung tissues following transplantation might be associated with pulmonary fibrosis in late non-infectious pulmonary complications.

Effect of diet on the survival and phenotype of a mouse model for spinal muscular atrophy.

ADAMTSL-6 is a novel extracellular matrix protein that binds to fibrillin-1 and promotes fibrillin-1 fibril formation. ADAMTS (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs)-like (ADAMTSL) proteins, a subgroup of the ADAMTS superfamily, share several domains with ADAMTS proteinases, including thrombospondin type I repeats, a cysteine-rich domain, and an ADAMTS spacer, but lack a catalytic domain. We identified two new members of ADAMTSL proteins, ADAMTSL-6alpha and -6beta, that differ in their N-terminal amino acid sequences but have common C-terminal regions. When transfected into MG63 osteosarcoma cells, both isoforms were secreted and deposited into pericellular matrices, although ADAMTSL-6alpha, in contrast to -6beta, was barely detectable in the conditioned medium. Immunolabeling at the light and electron microscopic levels showed their close association with fibrillin-1-rich microfibrils in elastic connective tissues. Surface plasmon resonance analyses demonstrated that ADAMTSL-6beta binds to the N-terminal half of fibrillin-1 with a dissociation constant of approximately 80 nm. When MG63 cells were transfected or exogenously supplemented with ADAMTSL-6, fibrillin-1 matrix assembly was promoted in the early but not the late stage of the assembly process. Furthermore, ADAMTSL-6 transgenic mice exhibited excessive fibrillin-1 fibril formation in tissues where ADAMTSL-6 was overexpressed. All together, these results indicated that ADAMTSL-6 is a novel microfibril-associated protein that binds directly to fibrillin-1 and promotes fibrillin-1 matrix assembly.

Syphilis and gonorrhoea in men who have sex with men: a European overview. This paper describes recent trends in the epidemiology of syphilis and gonorrhoea infections in Europe among men who have sex with men (MSM). Routine surveillance data submitted to the European Surveillance of Sexually Transmitted Infections (ESSTI) network from 24 European countries for the period 1998-2007 were analysed. Data on whether syphilis and gonorrhoea infections were in MSM were available for 12 and 10 countries respectively. The number of syphilis cases reported to be MSM increased considerably in all Western European countries. While in some Central and Eastern European countries the male to female ratio remained relatively stable at around 1:1, in Slovenia and Czech Republic the proportion of male cases increased and so did the percentage of cases reported to be MSM. More cases of gonorrhoea were seen in men than women, but the percentage of male cases reported to be MSM was lower than for syphilis. The findings suggest MSM are at high risk of STI in Western Europe and appear to be an increasingly important risk group in Central Europe. Despite this, data on infections among MSM are not collected routinely in many countries. The introduction of standardised data collection including data on diagnoses in MSM should be prioritised for monitoring STI in this population.

Sleep, performance and behaviour in Australian indigenous and non-indigenous children: an exploratory comparison. Sleep problems in Australian children are common and consequential but have not been investigated in Australian Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander (indigenous) children. This study compares sleep in indigenous and non-indigenous children and investigates potential effects on school performance and daytime behaviour. Subjects included 25 indigenous and 25 non-indigenous children (mean standard deviation (SD) age = 8.8 (1.4 years), range 7-11.11 years), in six Northern Territory primary schools. Parents completed the Sleep Disorders Scale for Children which produces a T-score (mean = 50 (SD = 10)) for behavioural sleep disorders, sleep disordered breathing, parasomnias, excessive daytime sleepiness and night sweating. Behaviour and school grades were assessed with the parent-reported Child Behaviour Checklist. Behavioural sleep problems of initiating and maintaining sleep, or parasomnias were commonly reported by both groups (24-40%), with indigenous children under 9 years reporting the most problems. No between-group differences were found in school performance. Significant relationships between sleep quality and behaviours were found, particularly for indigenous children. These data suggest that substantial numbers of Australian children - more than one third in this pilot sample - may suffer from significant sleep problems. To the extent that sleep problems may impair prefrontal cortical function, emotional regulation, and control of behaviour, confirmation of current findings could have particular import for indigenous children.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of hospital infection control response to an epidemic respiratory virus threat. The outbreak of influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 prompted many countries in Asia, previously strongly affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), to respond with stringent measures, particularly in preventing outbreaks in hospitals. We studied actual direct costs and cost-effectiveness of different response measures from a hospital perspective in tertiary hospitals in Singapore by simulating outbreaks of SARS, pandemic (H1N1) 2009, and 1918 Spanish influenza. Protection measures targeting only infected patients yielded lowest incremental cost/death averted of 23,000 (US dollars) for pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Enforced protection in high-risk areas (Yellow Alert) and full protection throughout the hospital (Orange Alert) averted deaths but came at an incremental cost of up to $2.5 million/death averted. SARS and Spanish influenza favored more stringent measures. High case-fatality rates, virulence, and high proportion of atypical manifestations impacted cost-effectiveness the most. A calibrated approach in accordance with viral characteristics and community risks may help refine responses to future epidemics.

Renoprotective effect of rosuvastatin in DOCA-salt hypertensive rats. Pleiotropic effects of statins represent potential mechanisms for the treatment of end organ damage in hypertension. This study has investigated the effects of rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) on renal function impairment, glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive (DSH) rat. Rats were implanted with DOCA strips (200 mg/kg) on 1 week after unilateral nephrectomy. Rats received a controlled diet with or without rosuvastatin. Three weeks after DOCA implantation, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by tail-cuff method. The glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis was determined by Masson's trichrome stain. The tumour necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), monocyte chemoattractant protein1 (MCP1), intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expression of ED-1, transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was determined in the kidney by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. In DSH rats, SBP was increased, which was not affected by rosuvastatin treatment. Creatinine clearance was decreased while urinary albumin excretion ratio was increased in DSH rats compared with controls, which were attenuated by rosuvastatin treatment. Glomerulosclerosis and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in DSH rats were attenuated by rosuvastatin treatment. The messenger RNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IFN-gamma, MCP1, ICAM-1 and ET-1 was increased in DSH, which was attenuated by rosuvastatin treatment. The expression of ED-1, TGF-beta and CTGF was increased in the kidney of DSH, which was counteracted by rosuvastatin treatment. Rosuvastatin is effective in preventing progression of renal injury in DSH, the mechanism of which is associated with anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects.

Obesity does not correlate with adverse pathologic findings on transperineal template-guided mapping biopsy of the prostate. Obesity has correlated with adverse pathologic features on prostate biopsy and may predispose to a higher rate of prostate cancer-related death after radical prostatectomy. In this study, we examine the potential relationship between body mass index (BMI) and histopathologic findings on transperineal template-guided mapping biopsy of the prostate (TTMB). From January 2005 to January 2008, 244 consecutive patients underwent TTMB using an anatomic-based technique. The criteria for TTMB included previously negative transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy with persistently elevated PSA and/or diagnosis of ASAP, or HG-PIN. The study population was divided into 4 different BMI cohorts (BMI < 25, BMI 25-29.9, BMI 30-34.9, and BMI â¥ 35 kg/m(2)). Biopsy findings were compared between the various BMI cohorts using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Ï(2) test. Pre-TTMB clinical parameters, including PSA and prostate volume, were not significantly different between the various BMI cohorts. On average, the study population had undergone 1.7 TRUS biopsies before TTMB. Of the 244 study patients, 112 (45.9%), were diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinoma on TTMB. There was no difference in the rate of cancer detection between the different BMI cohorts. Among patients diagnosed with prostate cancer, BMI did not correlate with Gleason score or percent of positive biopsy cores. When the geography of biopsy-positive cores was analyzed, there were no statistically significant differences in cancer location among the different BMI groups. In this study, obesity did not predispose toward higher Gleason score, larger cancer volume, or geographic cancer distribution on repeat biopsy with TTMB.


Prevention of hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury by pre-administration of catalase-expressing adenovirus vectors.

[Surgical treatment of chronic venous insufficiency]. Patients with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) may develop serious symptoms such as pain, oedema, venous claudication and leg ulcers. Conventional therapy includes compression therapy, elevation of the extremities, and in some cases surgical elimination of superficial varicose veins. This article presents and discusses surgical treatment (reconstructive deep venous surgery and transplantation) and endovascular therapy (percutaneous recanalization of post-thrombotic deep venous occlusions). The article is based on literature identified through non-systematic searches in the PubMed and Cochrane databases. After reconstructive deep venous surgery, ulcer healing is reported in 60-78 % of cases and clinical improvement in 90 %. After such surgery, the median ulcer-free period seems to be longer in primary (congenital, familial), 54 months, than in secondary (after deep vein thrombosis) chronic venous insufficiency (18 months). Recanalization of deep venous occlusions is successful in 90 % of patients who have undergone endovascular treatment of venous claudication and leg ulcer. Reconstructive deep venous surgery constitutes a real treatment choice for patients with chronic venous insufficiency for whom conventional measures have failed. The benefits are ulcer-free periods, clinical improvement, return to work and improved quality of life.

A multipathway phosphoproteomic signaling network model of idiosyncratic drug- and inflammatory cytokine-induced toxicity in human hepatocytes. Idiosyncratic drug hepatotoxicity is a hepatotoxicity subset that occurs in a very small fraction of human patients, is poorly predicted by standard preclinical models and in clinical trials, and frequently leads to postapproval drug failure. Animal models utilizing bacterial LPS co-administration to induce an inflammatory background and hepatocyte cell culture models utilizing cytokine mix cotreatment have successfully reproduced idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity signatures for certain drugs, but the hepatocyte signaling mechanisms governing these drug-cytokine toxicity synergizes are largely unclear. Here, we summarize our efforts to computationally model the signaling mechanisms regulating inflammatory cytokine-associated idiosyncratic drug hepatotoxicity. We collected a "cue-signal-response" (CSR) data compendium in cultured primary human hepatocytes treated with many combinations of idiosyncratic hepatotoxic drugs and inflammatory cytokine mixes ("cues") and subjected this compendium to orthogonal partial-least squares regression (OPLSR) to computationally relate the measured intracellular phosphoprotein signals and hepatocellular death responses. This OPLSR model suggested that hepatocytes specify their cell death responses to toxic drug/cytokine conditions by integrating signals from four key pathways - Akt, p70 S6K, ERK, and p38. An OPLSR model focused on data from these four signaling pathways demonstrated accurate predictions of idiosyncratic drug- and cytokine-induced hepatotoxicities in a second human hepatocyte donor, suggesting that hepatocytes from different individuals have shared network control mechanisms governing toxicity responses to diverse combinations of idiosyncratic hepatotoxicants and inflammatory cytokines.


Identification of a novel antibody associated with autoimmune pancreatitis.

Severe MUPS in a sick-listed population: a cross-sectional study on prevalence, recognition, psychiatric co-morbidity and impairment. Medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUPS) have a high prevalence in the general population and are associated with psychiatric morbidity. There are indications that MUPS are an important determinant of frequent and long-term disability. The primary objective was to assess the prevalence of MUPS in sick-listed-employees and its associations with depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, health anxiety, distress and functional impairment. Secondary objectives were to investigate the classification of the occupational health physicians (OHPs), their opinions about the causes as well as the attributions of the employee. In a cross-sectional study of 489 sick-listed employees from 5 OHP group practices, MUPS, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, health anxiety, distress and functional impairment were assessed with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), the Whitely Index (WI), the Four-Dimensional Symptom Questionnaire (4DSQ) and the Short-Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36). We used a cut off score of 15 on the PHQ for the categorisation of severe MUPS. The opinions of the OHPs were evaluated by means of a separate questionnaire with regard to the presence of employees physical symptoms, and the symptoms attributions, and the diagnoses of the OHPs. Severe MUPS had a prevalence of 15.1% in this population of sick-listed employees. These employees had 4-6 times more depressive and anxiety disorders, and were more impaired. Female gender and PHQ-9 scores were determinants of severe MUPS. Most of the time the OHPs diagnosed employees with severe MUPS as having a mental disorder. The employees attributed their physical symptoms in 66% to mental or to both mental and physical causes. The prevalence of severe MUPS is higher in long-term sick-listed employees than in the non-sick- listed working population and at least equals the prevalence in the general practice population. Severe MUPS are associated with psychiatric morbidity and functional impairment and must therefore be specifically recognised as such. Validated questionnaires, such as the PHQ-15, are useful instruments in order to help OHPs to recognise severe MUPS.

The WWAMI Targeted Rural Underserved Track (TRUST) Program: An Innovative Response to Rural Physician Workforce Shortages. Too few physicians practice in rural areas. To address the physician workforce needs of the Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana, and Idaho (WWAMI) region, the University of Washington School of Medicine developed the Targeted Rural Underserved Track (TRUST) program in August 2008. TRUST is a four-year curriculum centered on a clinical longitudinal continuity experience with students repeatedly returning to a single site located in a rural community or small city. The overarching theme of TRUST is one of linkages. Students are strategically linked to a rural community, known as their TRUST continuity community (TCC). The program begins with a targeted admission process and combines new and established programs and curricular elements to form a cohesive educational experience. This experience includes repeated preclinical visits, clerkships, and electives at a student's TCC, and rural health courses, the Underserved Pathway, and the Rural Underserved Opportunities Program (which includes a community-oriented primary care scholarly project). TRUST was piloted in Montana in 2008. With the matriculating class of 2015, every state in the WWAMI region will have TRUST students. From 2009 (the year targeted admissions began) to 2015, 123 students have been accepted into TRUST. Thirty-three students have graduated. Thirty (90.9%) of these graduates have entered residencies in needed regional specialties. Next steps include implementing a robust evaluation program, obtaining secure institutional programmatic funding, and further developing linkages with regional rural residency programs. TRUST may be a step forward in addressing regional needs and a reproducible model for other medical schools.


A consensus protocol for the standardization of cerebrospinal fluid collection and biobanking.

Early postnatal behavioral changes in the Mecp2-308 truncation mouse model of Rett syndrome. In a mouse model of Rett syndrome (RTT) which expresses a truncated form of methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (Mecp2) gene (Mecp2-308), we performed a neurobehavioral evaluation across the life span, starting from soon after birth till adulthood. A focus was made on those developmental phases and behavioral domains which have not been previously investigated. The results evidenced subtle anomalies on postnatal days (pnds) 3 to 9 (so-called presymptomatic phase) in spontaneous movements by hemizygous neonatal male mice. Specifically as early as pnd 3, mutant pups exhibited more intense curling and more side responses and on pnd 9 more pivoting and head rising behaviors than wild type (wt) littermates. A significant decrease in ultrasonic vocalization rate, also emerged in Mecp2-308 pups. The same mice were also characterized by increased anxiety-like behaviors (open-field and zero-maze tests) during the early symptomatic phase, in the absence of changes in cognitive passive-avoidance task and rotarod performances. Upon the clearly symptomatic stage, 5-month-old Mecp2-308 mice were also associated with reduced spontaneous home-cage motor activity, motor coordination impairments (rotarod and dowel tests), and a more marked profile of D-amphetamine (10 mg/kg) released stereotyped behavioral syndrome than wt mice. Present results provide an interesting timeline of the progression of symptoms in the Mecp2-308 model and emphasize the need for increased attention to the presymptomatic phase which may be especially informative in mouse models of human neurodevelopmental disorders. This analysis has provided evidence of precocious behavioral markers of RTT and has identified an early developmental window of opportunities on which potential therapies could be investigated.

Screening Solid Foods Infants 1 (SSFI-1) development of a screening tool to detect problems in the transition from milk to solid food in infants from six to nine months of age. To establish the psychometric properties of a newly developed screening tool Screening Solid Foods Infants 1 (SSFI-1) used by early childhood professionals, to detect problems in the transition from milk to solid food of smooth consistency in infants 6-9 months of age. The SSFI-1 score was filled out by the parents of a subgroup with term infants (n=35); healthy preterm infants (n=26); infants with comorbidity (n=17); infants with feeding problems (n=13). Internal consistency, reproducibility, construct, criterion and related validity was evaluated. The preterm subgroup differed significantly in age when starting with fruits/vegetables and period of experience (p<0.01). The SSFI-1 was sufficiently reliable for the total group and term subgroup (Î±=0.78 and 0.76), but not for the preterm and comorbidity/feeding problem subgroup (Î±=0.51 and 0.69). Inter-rater reliability was high for the total score (n=25, ICC r=0.93), and moderate to good for individual items (weighted kappa range 0.55-0.95). Validity was confirmed by significantly higher scores for the comorbidity/feeding problem subgroups and clinically distinguishable subgroups (p<0.05) and area under the curve values>0.78. The initial 10-item screening tool was modified to a seven item screening tool. A SSFI-1 score of 4, +2 SD of the term subgroup, had 76.9% sensitivity and 82.1% specificity, for detecting the presence of a feeding problem. The seven-item screening tool Screening Solid Foods 1 may be used as a screening tool for term infants. Further testing of the SSFI-1 in new infants is needed, to confirm reliability and validity both for term, preterm and (risk for) feeding problem infants.

Health visiting: a profession in transition. Health visiting will celebrate its 150th birthday in 2012. This paper reviews circumstances leading to the highly disturbing reduction in health visitor numbers in England over the past four years and the scale of the reductions. It highlights the considerable impact of these reductions on services for children and families. Finally it discusses what must be done to re-energise health visiting and what actions are expected to result from the "Action on Health Visiting" programme led by the Department of Health.

Unilateral combined laryngocoele with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis: case report. We report a case of unilateral combined laryngocoele occurring in conjunction with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Case report and review of the literature concerning the physiology underlying laryngocoele formation. A laryngocoele is an abnormal, air-filled dilation of the laryngeal saccule which communicates with the laryngeal lumen. We report a case of a 53-year-old man with a unilateral combined laryngocoele occurring in conjunction with recurrent respiratory papillomatosis. Microlaryngoscopy demonstrated a papilloma obstructing the laryngeal saccule. Removal of papillomata via laser excision and marsupialisation of the left laryngocoele improved the patient's vocal symptoms. There was no recurrence of papillomata or the laryngocoele. While many laryngocoeles can be explained by altered laryngeal physiology, the papilloma described in this case acted as an anatomical obstruction that trapped air within the saccule, creating an environment conducive to laryngocoele formation.

Can IVUS-virtual histology improve outcomes of percutaneous carotid treatment? Several previous studies focusing on comparison between outcomes of carotid artery stenting (CAS) and carotid endoarterectomy (CEA) have put forward conflicting results about the non-inferiority of CAS compared to CEA. Likely outcomes after CAS have been greatly limited by incomplete knowledge of atherosclerotic carotid pathology and probably inappropriate patient selection criteria. In the current practice, only the degree of lumen obstruction is indication to an invasive treatment (CEA or CAS) in symptomatic or asymptomatic patients, but it has been recently demonstrated that histology of carotid plaques also plays a major role. Indeed, plaque morphology and composition seem to influence more importantly outcomes of CAS than those of CEA. Angiography is a poor diagnostic tool to detect the severity and composition of atherosclerotic lesions. Virtual histology (VH) is a new technology incorporated in the latest intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) equipment that allows a validated histological characterization of plaques by performing a spectral, objective and highly-reproducible analysis of the radiofrequency and amplitude data of the ultrasound waves that cross different tissues. This manuscript reports authors' experience with the use of IVUS-VH during CAS. This new technology, by characterizing morphology, extension and histology of carotid plaque, seems to provide important information for confirming percentage of carotid stenosis and judging its embolic potential, tailoring the procedure and guiding the choice of stent and finally for checking stent apposition and complete covering of vulnerable plaques. According to authors' opinion IVUS-VH has the potential to optimize patients' and lesions' selection criteria for CAS in order to improve its outcomes.

Analysis of chronic morbidity parameters in workers engaged into processing and utilization of arms and military equipment did not reveal any case of occupational radiation disease over 30 years of medical observation. Standardized parameters in general and in separate diseases classes did not differ with general data collected in Russia. Occurrence of separate entities did not depend on influence of radiation factors.

Anthelmintic effects of phytogenic feed additives in Ascaris suum inoculated pigs. Two experiments were performed to determine the anthelmintic effect of some phytogenic feed additives on a mild infection of Ascaris suum in growing and finishing pigs. Usually, an infection of A. suum is controlled by using conventional synthetic drugs. Organic farmers, however, prefer a non-pharmaceutical approach to worm control. Therefore, phytotherapy could be an appropriate alternative. In the first experiment, a commercial available organic starter diet was supplemented with 3% of a herb mixture, adding 1% Thymus vulgaris, 1% Melissa officinalis and 1% Echinacea purpurea to the diet, or with 4% of a herb mixture, thereby adding the mentioned herbs plus 1% Camellia sinensis (black tea). A negative control group (no treatment) and a positive control group (treatment with conventional synthetic drug flubendazole) were included. In the second experiment, the anthelmintic properties against A. suum of three individual herbs, Carica papaya, Peumus boldus and Artemisia vulgaris, each in a dose of 1%, were tested. Pigs were infected with 1000 infective worm eggs each. Each experiment was performed with 32 individually housed growing pigs (8 replicates/treatment), which were monitored for 67 days. It was hypothesized that the herbs would block the cycles of the larvae, thereby preventing the development of adult worms. Therefore, phytogenic feed additives were not supplied during the whole experimental period, but only from the start until D39. Pigs were inoculated with infective worm eggs during five consecutive days (D17-D21). At D67 all pigs were dissected, whereafter livers were checked for the presence of white spots. Also numbers of worms in the small intestine were counted. In experiment 1, the numbers of worm-infected pigs were similar for both the herb supplemented (groups 3 and 4) and the unsupplemented (group 1) treatments (5-6 pigs of 8), while the treatment with flubendazole (group 2) resulted in 0 infected pigs. In experiment 2, herb addition (groups 2-4) did not significantly reduce the number of worm-infected pigs compared to the negative control (group 1). It can be concluded that the tested herb mixtures and individual herbs in the diets of growing and finishing pigs did not decrease the number of pigs which were infected with A. suum, although the herb mixture without black tea and also boldo leaf slightly (P<0.10) reduced the number of worms in the intestinal tract. The tested herb mixtures and individual herbs did not affect the performance of the pigs.

The pivotal role of the complement system in aging and age-related macular degeneration: hypothesis re-visited. During the past ten years, dramatic advances have been made in unraveling the biological bases of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the most common cause of irreversible blindness in western populations. In that timeframe, two distinct lines of evidence emerged which implicated chronic local inflammation and activation of the complement cascade in AMD pathogenesis. First, a number of complement system proteins, complement activators, and complement regulatory proteins were identified as molecular constituents of drusen, the hallmark extracellular deposits associated with early AMD. Subsequently, genetic studies revealed highly significant statistical associations between AMD and variants of several complement pathway-associated genes including: Complement factor H (CFH), complement factor H-related 1 and 3 (CFHR1 and CFHR3), complement factor B (CFB), complement component 2 (C2), and complement component 3 (C3). In this article, we revisit our original hypothesis that chronic local inflammatory and immune-mediated events at the level of Bruch's membrane play critical roles in drusen biogenesis and, by extension, in the pathobiology of AMD. Secondly, we report the results of a new screening for additional AMD-associated polymorphisms in a battery of 63 complement-related genes. Third, we identify and characterize the local complement system in the RPE-choroid complex - thus adding a new dimension of biological complexity to the role of the complement system in ocular aging and AMD. Finally, we evaluate the most salient, recent evidence that bears directly on the role of complement in AMD pathogenesis and progression. Collectively, these recent findings strongly re-affirm the importance of the complement system in AMD. They lay the groundwork for further studies that may lead to the identification of a transcriptional disease signature of AMD, and hasten the development of new therapeutic approaches that will restore the complement-modulating activity that appears to be compromised in genetically susceptible individuals.

Illness during pregnancy and bacterial vaginosis are associated with in-utero HIV-1 transmission. HIV-1 transmission in utero accounts for 20-30% of vertical transmission events in breast-feeding populations. In a prospective study of 463 HIV-1-infected mothers and infants, illness during pregnancy was associated with 2.6-fold increased risk of in-utero HIV-1 transmission [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.2-5.8] and bacterial vaginosis with a three-fold increase (95% CI 1.0-7.0) after adjusting for maternal HIV-1 viral load. Interventions targeting these novel risk factors could lead to more effective prevention of transmission during pregnancy.

Receptors and ligands implicated in human T cell costimulatory processes. It is well established that full activation of T cells that recognize antigens requires additional signals. These second signals are generated by the interaction of costimulatory ligands expressed on antigen presenting cells with their receptors on T cells. In addition, T cell activation processes are negatively regulated by inhibitory costimulatory pathways. Interaction of members of the B7 and the TNF superfamilies with members of the CD28 and TNF-R-superfamilies plays major roles in costimulatory processes. However, a large number of molecules that do not belong to these families have been reported to be involved in the generation of T cell costimulatory signals. In addition to well-defined costimulatory pathways, where both receptors and ligands are known, there are many T cell surface molecules that have been described to generate a second signal under certain experimental conditions, f.i. when ligated with antibodies. Furthermore there are several ligands that have been shown to positively or negatively modulate T cell activation by interacting with as of yet unknown T cell receptors. Here we give a comprehensive overview of molecules that have been implicated in human T cell activation processes and propose criteria that define genuine T cell costimulatory pathways.

Effect of castor oil emulsion eyedrops on tear film composition and stability. An emulsion eyedrop containing castor oil has been shown to modify the tear film lipid layer and increase tear film stability. The primary objectives of this investigation were to measure the prevalence of castor oil in the tear fluid over time and quantify the effects on the lipid layer. A secondary objective was to quantify the initial effects on ocular symptomatology. The investigation was an open label pilot study on 5 normal and 10 dry eye subjects. A single eyedrop (Castor oil emulsion, Allergan) was instilled in each eye; the tear film appearance and composition were monitored for 4h via in vivo visualisation using the Tearscope and post in vivo tear samples analysis by HPLC. Combined results for both normal and dry eye subjects showed that castor oil was detected up to 4h after a single eyedrop instillation and associated with an increase in the level of tear film lipid. The relative amount of various lipid families was also changed. An increase in tear lipid layer thickness was significant up to one hour post-instillation for the symptomatic sub-population. The changes in tear film characteristics were associated with significantly lower symptoms up to four hours post-instillation for the symptomatic sub-population. This pilot investigation showed that castor oil eyedrops achieved a residence time of at least four hours post-instillation, producing a more stable tear film and an associated significant decrease in ocular symptoms over the entire follow-up period for the symptomatic subjects.

Modelling of energy expended by free swimming spermatozoa in temperature-dependent viscous semen. Derived models of fertilization kinetics have relied upon estimates of the swimming velocity of spermatozoa from the insemination site to a fallopian tube. However, limited derivations are available describing the probability and energy expended when spermatozoa collide with one another. An analytic approach of spermatozoon motion in a linear viscoelastic fluid is adopted to simplify the derivation. The complex kinematics of motion of an inextensible flagellum is modelled as planar flagellar wave of small amplitude. In humans, a temperature difference is expected between the cooler tubal isthmus and the warmer tubal ampulla. Thus, fluidic characteristics of semen such as viscosity can vary along the female reproductive tract. The results suggest that the probability of spermatozoa colliding in relatively lower viscous semen increases by 64.87% for a 0.5 degrees C surge in temperature. Moreover, this increases for a denser concentration of spermatozoa due to the limited semen volume available to manoeuvre. In addition, the propulsive forces and shear stress were 39.35% lower in less viscous semen due to an increase in temperature of only 0.5 degrees C. Hence, the described derivations herein can assist in the understanding of work done by a normal motile spermatozoon in a pool of semen.

Sleep habits in Nigerian undergraduates. Quantity of night sleep is shorter than 8 h in several developed countries, but similar data is not available for most African countries. The objective of this study was to describe the quantity of night sleep, factors that are associated with non-restorative sleep, and sleep habits in a population of undergraduates in Nigeria. Questionnaires were used to collect information about bedtimes, waketimes, intra-night awakenings, non-restorative sleep, and afternoon naps over a period of 14 days. Mean duration of night sleep was 6.2 h (median 6.0, range 4.5-9.3), while mean duration of daytime naps was 70 min (median 75, range 10-315). Duration of night sleep was associated with day of the week and gender, but not with BMI. Non-restorative sleep, which occurred 25% of total sleep times, was associated with night sleep < or =5 h, hypnotic use, alarm to wake, heavy workload, and afternoon naps. Intra-night sleep awakening occurred 58.5% of total sleep times. Afternon naps were taken by 225 (82%) of subjects. Duration of night sleep in this African population is not longer than the duration in Western countries. Intra-night awakening and non-restorative sleep; however, occur more frequently, and afternoon nap is usually in excess of 1 h.

Evaluation of Intravesical Prostatic Protrusion as a Predictor of Dutasteride-Resistant Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms/Benign Prostatic Enlargement With a High Likelihood of Surgical Intervention. To investigate factors predicting that combination therapy would be insufficient in terms of efficacy, necessitating conversion to surgical intervention, in patients with lower urinary tract symptoms and/or benign prostatic enlargement. In total, 218 patients given combination therapy for 6 months or more were enrolled in our study. Candidate factors for surgical intervention before dutasteride administration were statistically analyzed. We also examined the proportion of stromal components in resected specimens of the intravesical prostatic protrusion (IPP) portion using the point-counting technique according to IPP grades. Combination therapy was effective and was thus continued in 172 patients, whereas 46 required surgical intervention. The comparison between these two groups, by multivariate analysis, revealed significant differences in IPP and total International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). IPP (odds ratio 1.133, P <.001) was the strongest independent factor predicting conversion to surgical intervention. Receiver operating characteristic analysis identified the optimal cutoff value of IPP to be 8 mm (area under the curve: 0.9). This value yielded a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 72%. In addition, the mean proportion of stromal components in resected specimens of IPP according to IPP grades was grade I: 96.7%, grade II: 57.8%, and grade III: 21.4% (P <.001 for all), respectively. Our results suggest that in lower urinary tract symptoms and/or benign prostatic enlargement associated with severe IPP, combination therapy might have insufficient efficacy due to a low proportion of stromal components, necessitating conversion to surgical intervention.

Dopaminergic transplantation for Parkinson's disease: current status and future prospects. Cell-based therapies that involve transplantation into the striatum of dopaminergic cells have attracted considerable interest as possible treatments for Parkinson's disease (PD). However, all double-blind, sham-controlled, studies have failed to meet their primary endpoints, and transplantation of dopamine cells derived from the fetal mesencephalon is associated with a potentially disabling form of dyskinesia that persists even after withdrawal of levodopa (off-medication dyskinesia). In addition, disability in advanced patients primarily results from features such as gait dysfunction, freezing, falling, and dementia, which are likely due to nondopaminergic pathology. These features are not adequately controlled with dopaminergic therapies and are thus unlikely to respond to dopaminergic grafts. More recently, implanted dopamine neurons have been found to contain Lewy bodies, suggesting that they are dysfunctional and may have been affected by the PD pathological process. Collectively, these findings do not bode well for the short-term future of cell-based dopaminergic therapies in PD.

Ellagic acid inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced expression of enzymes involved in the synthesis of prostaglandin E2 in human monocytes. Ellagic acid, a natural polyphenol found in certain fruits, nuts and vegetables, has in recent years been the subject of intense research within the fields of cancer and inflammation. Pain, fever and swelling, all typical symptoms of inflammation, are ascribed to elevated levels of PGE2. In the present study, we have investigated the effects of ellagic acid on PGE2 release and on prostaglandin-synthesising enzymes in human monocytes. Ellagic acid was found to inhibit Ca ionophore A23187-, phorbol myristate acetate- and opsonised zymosan-induced release of PGE2 from monocytes pre-treated with the inflammatory agent lipopolysaccharide. Ellagic acid suppressed the lipopolysaccharide-induced increase in protein expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2), microsomal PGE synthase-1 (mPGEs-1) and cytosolic phospholipase A2alpha (cPLA2alpha), while it had no effect on the constitutively expressed COX-1 protein. Ellagic acid had no apparent inhibitory effect on these enzymes when the activities were determined in cell-free assays. We conclude that the inhibitory effect of ellagic acid on PGE2 release from monocytes is due to a suppressed expression of COX-2, mPGEs-1 and cPLA2alpha, rather than a direct effect on the activities of these enzymes.


Adiponectin inhibits allograft rejection in murine cardiac transplantation.

Single-accelerometer-based daily physical activity classification. In this study, a single tri-axial accelerometer placed on the waist was used to record the acceleration data for human physical activity classification. The data collection involved 24 subjects performing daily real-life activities in a naturalistic environment without researchers' intervention. For the purpose of assessing customers' daily energy expenditure, walking, running, cycling, driving, and sports were chosen as target activities for classification. This study compared a Bayesian classification with that of a Decision Tree based approach. A Bayes classifier has the advantage to be more extensible, requiring little effort in classifier retraining and software update upon further expansion or modification of the target activities. Principal components analysis was applied to remove the correlation among features and to reduce the feature vector dimension. Experiments using leave-one-subject-out and 10-fold cross validation protocols revealed a classification accuracy of approximately 80%, which was comparable with that obtained by a Decision Tree classifier.

[Chest CT: spectrum of normal findings]. A fundamental issue in the interpretation of chest CT lies in the ability to determine normality. Technical advances have resulted in an increasing number of submillimeter sections which in turn has resulted in the identification of a large number of minor abnormalities with no significant pathophysiological consequence. These images should be properly interpreted in order to avoid unnecessary follow-up examinations and radiation exposure. Often they are due to respiratory or cardiac motion artifacts. Others are explained by aging, anatomic variants, physiological phenomenon or tobacco use. These borderline imaging features detected on chest CT are described according to the main anatomical compartments of the thorax: lung and vessels, airways, pleura and chest wall, mediastinum and heart.

Assessment of embryonic growth in chicken eggs by means of visible transmission spectroscopy. During this work, it was investigated whether spectral measurements can be used to monitor embryonic growth. An experiment was conducted in which both the transmission spectra and embryonic weight were determined on 240 eggs (Cobb, 37 weeks) between Day 5 and Day 10 of incubation. The spectral data were linked to embryonic weight by means of a partial least squares analysis. Different preprocessing procedures were compared during this work, that is, smoothing, multiplicative scatter correction (MSC), and first- and second-order derivative. Compared to the remainder of the preprocessing procedures, MSC leads to a considerable improvement of the prediction capability of the embryonic weight. The ratio of performance to deviation obtained for the MSC spectra equaled 4.5 indicating that a very accurate prediction of embryonic weight is feasible based on the VIS/NIR transmission measurements. Important regions for the prediction are situated around 685-740 nm. It is suggested that the spectral changes in these spectral regions result from the displacement of carotenoids from the yolk into the blood circuitry.

Efficacy and safety of iodopovidone pleurodesis in malignant pleural effusions. Pleurodesis is one of the best methods of controlling malignant pleural effusions (MPE), a distressing complication of metastatic disease. In recent studies of a wide range of pleural diseases, iodopovidone was used as a sclerosing agent for pleurodesis and demonstrated good results with low morbidity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iodopovidone pleurodesis in MPE. A retrospective analysis was performed on patients with MPE who underwent pleurodesis at our institution between 2005 and 2008. All patients underwent instillation of 20 mL of 10% iodopovidone, 80 mL of normal saline and 2 mg/kg of lidocaine through a chest tube, which was clamped for 2 h. The tube was removed when the daily output of fluid was <200 mL. Data on the requirement for additional pleural procedures, adverse events and survival were collected. Sixty-one pleurodesis procedures were performed in 54 patients. No procedure-related mortality was observed. Adverse events occurred after 11 (18%) pleurodesis procedures. The most frequent complication was mild thoracic pain that occurred immediately after 10 (16.4%) procedures, and one patient developed pleural empyema that was treated with drainage and antibiotics. A success rate of 98.4% was observed. Except for the patient who developed pleural empyema, none of the other patients had recurrences of pleural fluid or required additional pleural procedures during the follow-up period (mean of 5.6 months). Iodopovidone pleurodesis was successful and was associated with only a few minor complications. It appears to be a good option for the management of recurrent MPE.

Angiogenic and inflammatory markers of cardiopulmonary changes in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease. Pulmonary hypertension and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction are complications of sickle cell disease. Pulmonary hypertension is associated with hemolysis and hypoxia, but other unidentified factors are likely involved in pathogenesis as well. Plasma concentrations of three angiogenic markers (fibroblast growth factor, platelet derived growth factor-BB [PDGF-BB], vascular endothelial growth factor [VEGF]) and seven inflammatory markers implicated in pulmonary hypertension in other settings were determined by Bio-Plex suspension array in 237 children and adolescents with sickle cell disease at steady state and 43 controls. Tricuspid regurgitation velocity (which reflects systolic pulmonary artery pressure), mitral valve E/Edti ratio (which reflects left ventricular diastolic dysfunction), and a hemolytic component derived from four markers of hemolysis and hemoglobin oxygen saturation were also determined. Plasma concentrations of interleukin-8, interleukin-10 and VEGF were elevated in the patients with sickle cell disease compared to controls (P<or=0.003). By logistic regression, greater values for PDGF-BB (P = 0.009), interleukin-6 (P = 0.019) and the hemolytic component (P = 0.026) were independently associated with increased odds of elevated tricuspid regurgitation velocity while higher VEGF concentrations were associated with decreased odds (P = 0.005) among the patients with sickle cell disease. These findings, which are consistent with reports that PDGF-BB stimulates and VEGF inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, did not apply to E/Etdi. Circulating concentrations of angiogenic and pro-Inflammatory markers are altered in sickle cell disease children and adolescents with elevated tricuspid regurgitation velocity, a subgroup that may be at risk for developing worsening pulmonary hypertension. Further studies to understand the molecular changes in these children are indicated.

Cardiac adaptive responses after hypoxia in an experimental model. The role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and erythropoietin (EPO) in mediating hypoxic preconditioning under the acute intermittent hypoxic condition (AIH) was investigated in this study. Male Wistar rats were randomly assigned and kept in normoxic conditions, (Nx) or in AIH conditions and subjected to brief cycles hypoxia/reoxygenation. Hearts were isolated, perfused, and subjected to in vitro global ischemia followed by reperfusion. During and at the end of reperfusion, left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP); LV end diastolic pressure (LVEDP); rate pressure product (RPP); peak left ventricular pressure rise (DeltaP/Deltat (max) ) and heart rate (HR) were measured. Hearts subjected to AIH displayed a significant higher LVDP (P < .001), RPP (P < .001), and DeltaP/Deltat ( max) (P < .001). Expression of VEGF and EPO were significantly increased at 3, 8, and 24 hours after AIH. Hypoxic training could provide a new approach to enhance endogenous cardioprotective mechanisms.

Precocity of Gnathostoma turgidum in naturally infected four-eyed opossum Philander opossum pallidus from Temascal, Oaxaca, Mexico. Two female advanced third-stage larvae of Gnathostoma turgidum recovered from the liver of one naturally infected four-eyed opossum Philander opossum pallidus collected in Oaxaca, Mexico, were morphologically examined. Because of some characteristics, the larvae do not fit into the typical advanced third-stage. The body shows a size at least three times larger than expected and rows of spines only in the anterior part of the body surface. Consequently, in this research, we document for the first time the precocity in third-stage larvae of G. turgidum, and we also highlight some facts about the fourth larval stage occurring in spirurins.


Tumor-Associated Macrophages Provide Significant Prognostic Information in Urothelial Bladder Cancer.

Matrix metalloproteinase 13-deficient mice are resistant to osteoarthritic cartilage erosion but not chondrocyte hypertrophy or osteophyte development. To investigate the role of matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP-13; collagenase 3) in osteoarthritis (OA). OA was surgically induced in the knees of MMP-13-knockout mice and wild-type mice, and mice were compared. Histologic scoring of femoral and tibial cartilage aggrecan loss (0-3 scale), erosion (0-7 scale), and chondrocyte hypertrophy (0-1 scale), as well as osteophyte size (0-3 scale) and maturity (0-3 scale) was performed. Serial sections were stained for type X collagen and the MMP-generated aggrecan neoepitope DIPEN. Following surgery, aggrecan loss and cartilage erosion were more severe in the tibia than femur (P<0.01) and tibial cartilage erosion increased with time (P<0.05) in wild-type mice. Cartilaginous osteophytes were present at 4 weeks and underwent ossification, with size and maturity increasing by 8 weeks (P<0.01). There was no difference between genotypes in aggrecan loss or cartilage erosion at 4 weeks. There was less tibial cartilage erosion in knockout mice than in wild-type mice at 8 weeks (P<0.02). Cartilaginous osteophytes were larger in knockout mice at 4 weeks (P<0.01), but by 8 weeks osteophyte maturity and size were no different from those in wild-type mice. Articular chondrocyte hypertrophy with positive type X collagen and DIPEN staining occurred in both wild-type and knockout mouse joints. Our findings indicate that structural cartilage damage in a mouse model of OA is dependent on MMP-13 activity. Chondrocyte hypertrophy is not regulated by MMP-13 activity in this model and does not in itself lead to cartilage erosion. MMP-13 deficiency can inhibit cartilage erosion in the presence of aggrecan depletion, supporting the potential for therapeutic intervention in established OA with MMP-13 inhibitors.

Why some women look young for their age. The desire of many to look young for their age has led to the establishment of a large cosmetics industry. However, the features of appearance that primarily determine how old women look for their age and whether genetic or environmental factors predominately influence such features are largely unknown. We studied the facial appearance of 102 pairs of female Danish twins aged 59 to 81 as well as 162 British females aged 45 to 75. Skin wrinkling, hair graying and lip height were significantly and independently associated with how old the women looked for their age. The appearance of facial sun-damage was also found to be significantly correlated to how old women look for their age and was primarily due to its commonality with the appearance of skin wrinkles. There was also considerable variation in the perceived age data that was unaccounted for. Composite facial images created from women who looked young or old for their age indicated that the structure of subcutaneous tissue was partly responsible. Heritability analyses of the appearance features revealed that perceived age, pigmented age spots, skin wrinkles and the appearance of sun-damage were influenced more or less equally by genetic and environmental factors. Hair graying, recession of hair from the forehead and lip height were influenced mainly by genetic factors whereas environmental factors influenced hair thinning. These findings indicate that women who look young for their age have large lips, avoid sun-exposure and possess genetic factors that protect against the development of gray hair and skin wrinkles. The findings also demonstrate that perceived age is a better biomarker of skin, hair and facial aging than chronological age.

Preparation, characterization and taste-masking properties of microspheres containing azithromycin. The aim of this study was to prepare a microsphere formulation in order to mask the bitter taste of azithromycin. Microspheres of azithromycin with ethyl cellulose were prepared by the modified solvent diffusion method. The microspheres were mixed with other excipients to form orally dry suspensions and the sensory test for taste masking was evaluated. Results demonstrated that the suspension could significantly mask the bitter taste of azithromycin and the relative bioavailability of suspensions to reference preparations was 102.7%. The results indicate that the microsphere formulation can be a promising drug carrier for masking the bitter taste of azithromycin.

[Chronic blepharitis: which role for Demodex folliculorum? A case report]. We present a 73-year-old woman presented to our hospital with a 2 years history of eyes itching. The ophthalmological testing was normal. Physical examination revealed blepharitis and lesions acnea-like on mouth, nose and chest. Biological testing revealed no abnormalities. Histologic study and direct immunofluorescence on a cutaneous biopsy were no contributive. The research of an allergic origine was practised by cutaneous and serological tests and negative. An examination of eyelashes was performed and yielded Demodex. Demodex folliculorum is a mite that is the most common permanent ectoparasite of humans, which is thought to be linked to blepharitis and allergic blepharoconjunctivis with rosacea, although much controversy persists. Recent studies demonstrate a high frequence of chronic blepharitis when Demodex are abundant. Several molecules can be used to treat this infestation. Parasiticide as oral ivermectine may be useful when the infestation is important.

Vestibulo-ocular monitoring as a predictor of outcome after severe traumatic brain injury. Based on the knowledge that traumatic brainstem damage often leads to alteration in brainstem functions, including the vestibulo-ocular reflex, the present study is designed to determine whether prediction of outcome in the early phase after severe traumatic brain injury is possible by means of vestibulo-ocular monitoring. Vestibulo-ocular monitoring is based on video-oculographic recording of eye movements during galvanic labyrinth polarization. The integrity of vestibulo-ocular reflex is determined from the eye movement response during vestibular galvanic labyrinth polarization stimulation. Vestibulo-ocular monitoring is performed within three days after traumatic brain injury and the oculomotor response compared to outcome after six months (Glasgow Outcome Score). Twenty-seven patients underwent vestibulo-ocular monitoring within three days after severe traumatic brain injury. One patient was excluded from the study. In 16 patients oculomotor response was induced, in the remaining 11 patients no oculomotor response was observed. The patients' outcome was classified as Glasgow Outcome Score 1-2 or as Glasgow Outcome Score 3 to 5. Statistical testing supported the hypothesis that those patients with oculomotor response tended to recover (exact two-sided Fisher-Test (P < 10-3)). The results indicate that vestibulo-ocular monitoring with galvanic labyrinth polarization performed during the first days after traumatic brain injury helps to predict favourable or unfavourable outcome. As an indicator of brainstem function, vestibulo-ocular monitoring provides a useful, complementary approach to the identification of brainstem lesions by imaging techniques.

Inhibition effects on fermentation of hardwood extracted hemicelluloses by acetic acid and sodium. Extraction of hemicellulose from hardwood chips prior to pulping is a possible method for producing ethanol and acetic acid in an integrated forest bio-refinery, adding value to wood components normally relegated to boiler fuel. Hemicellulose was extracted from hardwood chips using green liquor, a pulping liquor intermediate consisting of aqueous NaOH, Na(2)CO(3), and Na(2)S, at 160 degrees C, held for 110 min in a 20 L rocking digester. The extracted liquor contained 3.7% solids and had a pH of 5.6. The organic content of the extracts was mainly xylo-oligosaccharides and acetic acid. Because it was dilute, the hemicellulose extract was concentrated by evaporation in a thin film evaporator. Concentrates from the evaporator reached levels of up to 10% solids. Inhibitors such as acetic acid and sodium were also concentrated by this method, presenting a challenge for the fermentation organisms. Fermentation experiments were conducted with Escherichia coli K011. The un-concentrated extract supported approximately 70% conversion of the initial sugars in 14 h. An extract evaporated down to 6% solids was also fermentable while a 10% solids extract was not initially fermentable. Strain conditioning was later found to enable fermentation at this level of concentration. Alternative processing schemes or inhibitor removal prior to fermentation are necessary to produce ethanol economically.

Aerobic interval training versus continuous moderate exercise after coronary artery bypass surgery: a randomized study of cardiovascular effects and quality of life. Peak oxygen uptake (Vo(2peak)) strongly predicts mortality in cardiac patients. We compared the effects of aerobic interval training (AIT) versus moderate continuous training (MCT) on Vo(2peak) and quality of life after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Fifty-nine CABG patients were randomized to either AIT at 90% of maximum heart rate or MCT at 70% of maximum heart rate, 5 d/wk, for 4 weeks at a rehabilitation center. Primary outcome was Vo(2peak), at baseline, after rehabilitation (4 weeks), and after 6 months of home-based exercise (6 months). Vo(2peak) increased between baseline and 4 weeks in AIT (27.1 +/- 4.5 vs 30.4 +/- 5.5 mL.kg(-1).min(-1), P < .001) and MCT (26.2 +/- 5.2 vs 28.5 +/- 5.6 mL.kg(-1).min(-1), P < .001; group difference, not significant). Aerobic interval training increased Vo(2peak) between 4 weeks and 6 months (30.4 +/- 5.5 vs 32.2 +/- 7.0 mL.kg(-1).min(-1), P < .001), with no significant change in MCT (28.5 +/- 5.6 vs 29.5 +/- 5.7 mL.kg(-1).min(-1)). Quality of life improved in both groups from baseline to 4 weeks, remaining improved at 6 months. There were no changes in echocardiographic systolic and diastolic left ventricular function. Adiponectin increased between 4 weeks and 6 months in both groups (group differences, not significant). Four weeks of intense training increased Vo(2peak) significantly after both AIT and MCT. Six months later, the AIT group had a significantly higher Vo(2peak) than MCT. The results indicate that AIT and MCT increase Vo(2peak) similarly in the short term, but with better long-term effect of AIT after CABG.

Pediatric Priapism Secondary to Psychotherapeutic Medications.

On-line microheterogeneity analysis and rapid phenotyping of haptoglobin by capillary electrophoresis using sodium dodecyl sulfate as additive. To improve the detection sensitivity and determine phenotypes of haptoglobin (Hp), a prefilling technique was developed and tested in capillary electrophoresis (CE) with UV-vis absorbance detection. Adding 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) to the protein sample and 0.1% SDS to the prefilling buffer solution, on-line stacking and microheterogeneity separation of Hp were achieved. In addition, the influences of pH, buffer concentration, sample and prefilling buffer SDS concentration upon resolution were examined. Under optimized conditions, Hp-microheterogeneity was well resolved and two phenotypes of Hp (Hp 1-1 and Hp 2-2) were differentiated. This method was applied to the analysis of sera from normal individuals and beta-Thalassemia patients. After the depletion of albumin (HSA) and immunoglobulin G (IgG), this method allowed to determine two phenotypes in different individuals and to detect the decrease of Hp in beta-Thalassemia patients. Featuring high efficiency, speed and simplicity, the proposed method shows great potential for use in clinical diagnosis and proteome research.

Ceratomyxa tunisiensis n. sp. (Myxosporea: Bivalvulida) from the Gallbladders of Two Carangid Fish Caught Off the Coast of Tunisia. A new coelozoic Myxozoan species, Ceratomyxa tunisiensis n. sp., was found infecting the gallbladders of two carangid fish, Caranx rhonchus and Trachurus trachurus (Perciforme, Carangidae), from the Gulf of GabÃ¨s, on the southern coast of Tunisia. The parasite develops in spherical mono-, diplo-, or polysporic tropozoites in the gallbladder of the hosts. Mature spores are typical of the genus Ceratomyxa. They are transversely elongated and narrowly crescent-shaped with a slightly convex anterior and concave posterior, and measure 23 Â± 0. 27 (20-25) Î¼m width Ã 6 Â± 0.26 (5-8) Î¼m in length. Spore shell valves are symmetrical with rounded ends. Two spherical polar capsules situated on either side of the sutural line measure 2.2 Î¼m (2.0-3.0) in diam. Periodical sampling of C. rhonchus and T. trachurus from Marsh 2012 to February 2013 showed that infection due to C. tunisiensis occurs in 59% and 69% of the examined fish, respectively. Molecular analysis based on the small subunit (SSU) rRNA sequence shows high genetic divergence with all other ceratomyxid species. A Maximum Likelihood phylogenetic tree shows association with the species C. leatharjecketi Fiala, kova, Kodadkova, Freeman, BartoÅ¡ova-Sojkova, and Atkinson, 2015 reported from the gallbladder of Aluterusmonoceros (L.) caught in the Andaman Sea, off Malaysia. Nonetheless, the SSU rRNA sequences of C. tunisiensis and C. leatharjecketi have only a 90% similarity.

Altered renal expression of aquaporin water channels and sodium transporters in rats with two-kidney, one-clip hypertension. To determine whether the renal regulation of aquaporin (AQP) water channels and sodium transporters are altered in 2-kidney, 1-clip (2K1C) hypertension. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. They were made 2K1C hypertensive for 1 week. The renal expression of AQPs and sodium transporters was determined by semiquantitative immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. The activity of adenylyl cyclase was measured by stimulated generation of cAMP. Systolic blood pressure was increased in 2K1C rats. Experimental rats revealed impaired urinary concentration in association with increased urine volume. Urinary sodium excretion also increased. The expression of AQP1-3 was decreased in the clipped kidney compared with the control kidney, whereas it was unchanged in the non-clipped kidney. The adenylyl cyclase activity provoked by arginine vasopressin, sodium fluoride or forskolin was blunted in the clipped kidney, but remained unaltered in the contralateral kidney. The expressions of the Na,K-ATPase alpha1-subunit, type 3 Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, Na-K-2Cl cotransporter and epithelial sodium channels were decreased in the clipped kidney, while remaining unchanged in the non-clipped kidney. The downregulation of AQPs and major sodium transporters/channels in the clipped kidney may play a role in the urinary concentration defect and impaired sodium reabsorption in 2K1C hypertension.

Effect of breed body size and the muscular hypertrophy gene in the production and carcass traits of concentrate-finished yearling bulls. To examine the extent of the effect of muscular hypertrophy character in beef of northern-Spanish breeds, animal performance and carcass characteristics of 152 finishing steers from 5 genotypes were studied: 32 yearling bulls from a rustic Asturiana de la MontaÃ±a (AM) breed, 96 yearling bulls from Asturiana de los Valles (AV) breed, divided in 3 groups depending on the presence of the gene responsible for double-muscling (i.e., 32 AV mh/mh, 32 AV mh/+, 32 AV +/+), and 24 yearling bulls from AM x AV cross were used. Each genotype was composed of 8 animals per year (4 animals per pen) for 4 yr, except for the AM x AV genotype, which was only evaluated in the last 3 yr of the experiment. All animals were fed indoors with concentrate meal and barley straw ad libitum. Average daily gains in AV animals (1.41 kg/d) were greater (P < 0.01) than in AM (1.12 kg/d), whereas AM x AV were intermediate (1.29 kg/d) to these. No significant differences (P = 0.604) in ADG were found among the 3 AV genotypes. Longer fattening periods (P < 0.001) were taken for AM animals to reach acceptable BW at slaughter. Double-muscled animals (AV mh/mh) were found to have the best feed efficiencies when expressed as G:F (P < 0.001). However, residual feed intake calculated on a daily basis showed a greater efficiency in AV mh/mh and AM than in other genotypes. Carcasses from double-muscled animals had greater BW, yield, conformation and compactness index, and less fat cover than the other genotypes (P < 0.001). Carcasses from AM breed were the lightest and had the worst conformation, whereas those from AM x AV generally presented intermediate characteristics between AV and AM. Double-muscled animals had the greatest LM weight and area. The sixth-rib dissection revealed a greater percentage of muscle (84.6%) and decreased percentages of subcutaneous fat (1.1%), intermuscular fat (4.7%), bone (8.5%), and other tissues (1.2%) in AV mh/mh compared with other genotypes. Water-holding capacity was greatest in AM and least in AV mh/mh. In conclusion, double-muscled AV bulls would provide the greatest economic returns at intensive feeding systems because of their greater efficiency, reduced feeding costs, greater carcass weight and conformation, and greater lean yields, though some LM characteristics (reduced fat content and water-holding capacity) could negatively affect the sensory attributes of the meat compared with other genotypes with greater fatness.

Effect of combined genetic polymorphisms on lung cancer risk in northern Thai women. Lung cancer is a major cause of cancer-related death in developed countries, and its incidence in developing countries is increasing. In Thailand, cancer incidences differ greatly from region to region, and lung cancer is the most common cancer in the northern Thai population. The polymorphic frequency of 10 genetic susceptibility genes and their association with lung cancer were examined in a northern Thai population: CYP1A1 (MspI), CYP1A1 (Ile462Val), CYP2E1 (PstI), CYP2E1 (DraI), GSTM1, GSTT1, MPO (AciI), OGG1 (Ser326Cys), TP53 (Arg72Pro), and MMP1(AluI). The 173 subjects were 91 lung cancer patients and 82 healthy volunteers. Although no significant association between any single genetic variant and lung cancer risk was observed, when genetic variants were analyzed in combination, a significant effect on lung cancer risk was found for the variant allele in a combination of five genes involved in oxidative stress and inflammatory response: GSTM1 (null), MPO (-463A), OGG1 (326Cys), TP53 (72Pro) (alias p53), MMP1 (2G). With a reference group of individuals carrying at least two wild-type genotypes of these five genes, it was found that an individual carrying three or more variant genotypes is at significantly higher risk of developing lung cancer with the increasing of odds ratios (OR) in concurrence with the number of variant genes. The OR was 2.41 (95% CI = 0.76-7.64), 3.90 (95% CI = 1.23-12.34), and 5.20 (95% CI = 1.31-20.54) for individuals carrying three, four, and five variants, respectively. After stratifying by sex, the OR was higher for women: OR 4.05 (95% CI = 0.44-36.94), 9.00 (95% CI = 0.95-84.89) and 18.00 (95% CI = 1.49-216.62) for three, four, and five variant genotypes, respectively. This augmented effect on lung cancer risk of variant genes involved in oxidative stress and inflammatory response in women with a low prevalence of smoking indicates their modifying effect on other risk factors, such as environmental cigarette smoke, air pollution, radon radiation, or infection of the airway. Confirmation would require further investigations with larger sample sizes.

[Optimized clinical use of vancomycin, a prospective observational study in a Paris teaching hospital]. Vancomycin is still the cornerstone of antibiotic therapy for patients with suspected or proven invasive methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections. However, clinical and pharmacodynamic studies underline that appropriate doses depend on the infection site, the patient's weight, his renal function, and the bacterial susceptibility. In this prospective study made in a Paris teaching hospital, our two goals were to describe the modalities of infusion and serum concentration obtained during therapy, in our pediatrics and adults population. In our hospital, vancomycin was administered every eight hours in 83 % (97/102) of the cases and the doses used were 30 mg/kg per day in 67 % of cases (68/102). Serum trough levels reached 15 mcg/ml and 20 mcg/ml in 36 % and 18 % of cases respectively. Moreover, despite adequate doses, trough levels of 15 mcg/ml were obtained in only 40 % of cases. Vancomycin infusion use could be optimized, by defining optimal serum concentrations and monitoring made by a mobile team of infectious diseases specialists.

Survival analysis after gastrostomy: a single-centre, observational study comparing radiological and endoscopic insertion. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) using the pull through technique is the most widely used insertion method. An alternative is a per-oral image-guided gastrostomy (PIG), which may be advantageous in high-risk patients. As there are no large studies comparing PEG against PIG, we wished to analyse mortality after endoscopic or radiological gastrostomy insertion. Patients referred for a gastrostomy are prospectively included in a database along with demographic, biochemical and outcome data. Analysis of gastrostomy insertions from February 2004 to 2007 was performed with reference to method of insertion and 30-day outcome. Patients were subgrouped into cognitive impairment, dysphagic stroke, oropharygeal cancer, neurological cancer and other. One hundred and seventy PIGs and 233 PEGs were inserted (mean age 62 years, 268 males). There were no differences in age between the PIG and the PEG group. The PIG 30-day mortality was 26 of 170 (15.3%) and the PEG 30-day mortality was 25 of 233 (10.7%) (P=0.17). One-year mortality was 92 of 170 (54.1%) for PIG and 131 of 233 (56.7%) for PEG (P=0.60). Subgroup analysis revealed higher 30-day mortality in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer undergoing PIG; 14 of 106 (13.2%) versus one of 69 (1.4%) (P=0.005). However, PIG patients were older than PEG patients (mean age 64 vs. 59.7 years, P=0.019) and had more comorbidities (21.1% in the PEG group and 37.7% in the PIG group). Overall PIG and PEG seem to have similar 30-day and 1-year mortality rates. Our data suggest that clinicians may opt for either approach depending on technical considerations and local availability.

Outcomes of liver transplantation in patients with cirrhosis due to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis versus patients with cirrhosis due to alcoholic liver disease. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is becoming a common cause of liver cirrhosis requiring liver transplantation (LT). Cardiovascular complications related to metabolic syndrome and NASH recurrence in the transplanted liver may affect the outcome of LT in these patients. We compared the outcomes of LT for NASH cirrhosis and alcoholic cirrhosis (ETOH) in a large transplant center. A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients who underwent LT for cryptogenic cirrhosis with the NASH phenotype (the NASH group) or ETOH (the ETOH group) at the University of Miami from January 1997 to January 2007. There was no significant difference in survival between the NASH and ETOH groups, despite a trend toward lower survival in the former (P = 0.1699). Sepsis was the leading cause of posttransplant death in both groups, and it was followed by cardiovascular causes in the NASH group (26% versus 7% in the ETOH group, P = 0.21) and malignancies in the ETOH group (29% versus 0% in the NASH group, P = 0.024). Recurrent steatohepatitis (33% versus 0%, P < 0.0001) and acute rejection (41% versus 23%, P < 0.023) were significantly more frequent in the NASH group than in the ETOH group. There was no difference in graft failure between the groups (24% in the NASH group versus 18% in the ETOH group, P = 0.3973). In conclusion, despite a numerical trend favoring the ETOH group, there were no statistically significant differences in posttransplant survival and cardiovascular mortality between the NASH and ETOH groups. Acute rejection and recurrent steatohepatitis were significantly more frequent in the NASH group but did not lead to higher rates of retransplantation.

Human-Centered Design as an Approach for Place-Based Innovation in Public Health: A Case Study from Oakland, California. This case study provides a high-level overview of the human-centered design (HCD) or "design thinking" process and its relevance to public health. The Best Babies Zone (BBZ) initiative is a multi-year project aimed at reducing inequities in infant mortality rates. In 2012, BBZ launched pilot programs in three US cities: Cincinnati, Ohio; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Oakland, California. The Alameda County Public Health Department (ACPHD), the lead for the Oakland BBZ site, identified HCD as a promising approach for addressing the social and economic conditions that are important drivers of health inequities. HCD is a process for creating innovative products, services, and strategies that prioritizes the needs of the intended population. ACPHD partnered with the Gobee Group (a social innovation design consultancy) to develop the Design Sprint. The Design Sprint was a 12-week pilot in which 14 professionals from nine organizations used the HCD process to develop concepts for stimulating a vibrant local economy in the Oakland Best Babies Zone. Thirty- to sixty-minute semi-structured interviews were conducted with all 14 individuals involved in the Design Sprint. With the exception of one interview, the interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and inductively coded to identify themes. Our experience suggests that HCD can: enhance community engagement; expedite the timeframe for challenge identification, program design, and implementation; and create innovative programs that address complex challenges.

Dental care and children with special health care needs: a population-based perspective. This paper grew out of a project reviewing progress in children's oral health after Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon General was published in 2000. It includes a summary of advances in national surveillance of children with special health care needs (CSHCN), and presents more recent data on unmet dental care need among CSHCN. To that end, we used the 2006 National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs to determine the prevalence of unmet dental care need among CSHCN and to compare this within subgroups of CSHCN, as well as to children without special health care needs, and to results from the previous iteration of this survey. Dental care remains the most frequently cited unmet health need for CSHCN. More CSHCN had unmet needs for nonpreventive than preventive dental care. CSHCN who are teens, poorer, uninsured, had insurance lapses, or are more severely affected by their condition had higher adjusted odds of unmet dental care needs. CSHCN who were both low income and severely affected had 13.4 times the adjusted odds of unmet dental care need. In summary, CSHCN are more likely to be insured and to receive preventive dental care at equal or higher rates than children without special health care needs. Nevertheless, CSHCN, particularly lower income and severely affected, are more likely to report unmet dental care need compared with unaffected children. Despite advances in knowledge about dental care among CSHCN, unanswered questions remain. Recommendations are provided toward obtaining additional data and facilitating dental care access for this vulnerable population.

First-in-human study demonstrating pharmacological activation of heme oxygenase-1 in humans. Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 degrades heme and protects against oxidative stress, but it has not been pharmacologically induced in humans. In this randomized study of 10 healthy volunteers, hemin (3 mg/kg intravenously in 25% albumin) was shown to increase plasma HO-1 protein concentration four- to fivefold and HO-1 activity ~15-fold relative to baseline at 24 and 48 h (placebo -56.41 +/- 6.31 (baseline), 69.79 +/- 13.00 (24 h), 77.44 +/- 10.62 (48 h) vs. hemin -71.70 +/- 9.20 (baseline), 1,126.20 +/- 293.30 (24 h), 1,192.20 +/- 333.30 (48 h)) in four of five subjects as compared with albumin alone (P </= 0.03). This represents the overcoming of a fundamental hurdle to HO-1 research in humans.

Surgical procedure for correcting globe dislocation in highly myopic strabismus. To design a surgical procedure for correcting globe dislocation in strabismus in high myopia (highly myopic strabismus). Prospective, interventional case series. We examined 36 eyes of 21 patients with highly myopic strabismus and 27 eyes of 27 healthy volunteers as controls at Osaka City General Hospital between 2000 and 2006. Anatomic relationships between the muscle cone and globe were analyzed using magnetic resonance imaging. Ranges of globe movement and angles of ocular deviation were measured quantitatively as angles of maximum abduction and sursumduction and angles of ocular deviation, respectively, using the Goldmann perimeter and alternate prism cover tests. A surgical procedure involving muscle union of the superior rectus and lateral rectus muscles was performed in 23 eyes of 14 patients to restore the dislocated globe back to the muscle cone. After surgery, the angle of dislocation of the globe, defined as the angle formed by a line connecting the area centroid of the superior rectus muscle and the globe and a line connecting area centroid of the lateral rectus muscle and globe against the supertemporal wall of the orbit, was significantly decreased (P < .001), and angles of maximum abduction and sursumduction and the angle of ocular deviation improved significantly (P < .001). This surgical procedure to restore the dislocated globe back into the muscle cone by uniting muscle bellies of the superior rectus and lateral rectus muscles is effective for highly myopic strabismus.

[Estimation of diagnostic value of the middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity in prediction of fetal anemia in pregnancies complicated by alloimmunisation]. The use of the middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (PSV) for the noninvasive diagnosis of fetal anemia in pregnancies complicated by alloimmunisation has the potential to reduce the number of invasive procedures. The study was undertaken to determine the detection of fetal anemia by fetal middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity (MCA PSV). 31 fetuses with red cell alloimmunisation were evaluated with Doppler ultrasongraphy. On the basis of ROC (AUC) analysis the cutoff point of MoM=1.215 with the highest sensitivity and specificity was established. We examined the relation between MoM=1.215 and neonatal hemoglobin level and the maternal antibody titre in the indirect antiglobulin test. Sensitivity specificity positive and negative value and statistical significance were calculated. Data reported to date suggest that a threshold of 1.215 multiples of the median can be used to better diagnostic of fetal anemia.

Overexpression of LAPTM4B promotes growth of gallbladder carcinoma cells in vitro. The overexpression of LAPTM4B-35 in gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) and its clinicopathologic and prognostic significance have been previously shown. Thus, this gene may play a role in the growth of GBC cells. The pcDNA3-AE containing the complete open reading frame of LAPTM4B (lysosome-associated protein transmembrane-4beta) and mock (pcDNA3) plasmids were transiently transfected into GBC-SD cells. Cell proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and protein expression were evaluated by 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium assay, flow cytometry, and Western blot, respectively. Cells transfected with pcDNA3-AE revealed accelerated proliferation, less serum dependence, and significant cell cycle progression compared with cells transfected with mock plasmid and parent cells. These phenotypes were accompanied by upregulated expression of C-myc, c-Fos, c-Jun, cyclin D1, and cyclin E and downregulated expression of P16 and P-27. LAPTM4B overexpression promotes the growth of GBC cells in vitro by regulating the expression levels of some proliferation-associated proteins. Therefore, the LAPTM4B gene might be used as a novel therapeutic target of GBC.

Estimation of metabolic pathway systems from different data sources. Parameter estimation is the main bottleneck of metabolic pathway modelling. It may be addressed from the bottom up, using information on metabolites, enzymes and modulators, or from the top down, using metabolic time series data, which have become more prevalent in recent years. The authors propose here that it is useful to combine the two strategies and to complement time-series analysis with kinetic information. In particular, the authors investigate how the recent method of dynamic flux estimation (DFE) may be supplemented with other types of estimation. Using the glycolytic pathway in Lactococcus lactis as an illustration example, the authors demonstrate some strategies of such supplementation.

New Trypanosoma (Duttonella) vivax genotypes from tsetse flies in East Africa. Salivarian trypanosomes pose a substantial threat to livestock, but their full diversity is not known. To survey trypanosomes carried by tsetse in Tanzania, DNA samples from infected proboscides of Glossina pallidipes and G. swynnertoni were identified using fluorescent fragment length barcoding (FFLB), which discriminates species by size polymorphisms in multiple regions of the ribosomal RNA locus. FFLB identified the trypanosomes in 65 of 105 (61.9%) infected proboscides, revealing 9 mixed infections. Of 7 different FFLB profiles, 2 were similar but not identical to reference West African Trypanosoma vivax; 5 other profiles belonged to known species also identified in fly midguts. Phylogenetic analysis of the glycosomal glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase gene revealed that the Tanzanian T. vivax samples fell into 2 distinct groups, both outside the main clade of African and South American T. vivax. These new T. vivax genotypes were common and widespread in tsetse in Tanzania. The T. brucei-like trypanosome previously described from tsetse midguts was also found in 2 proboscides, demonstrating a salivarian transmission route. Investigation of mammalian host range and pathogenicity will reveal the importance of these new trypanosomes for the epidemiology and control of animal trypanosomiasis in East Africa.


Mucinous nonneoplastic cyst of the pancreas: apomucin phenotype distinguishes this entity from intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm.

Synaptic activity-related classical protein kinase C isoform localization in the adult rat neuromuscular synapse. Protein kinase C (PKC) is essential for signal transduction in a variety of cells, including neurons and myocytes, and is involved in both acetylcholine release and muscle fiber contraction. Here, we demonstrate that the increases in synaptic activity by nerve stimulation couple PKC to transmitter release in the rat neuromuscular junction and increase the level of alpha, betaI, and betaII isoforms in the membrane when muscle contraction follows the stimulation. The phosphorylation activity of these classical PKCs also increases. It seems that the muscle has to contract in order to maintain or increase classical PKCs in the membrane. We use immunohistochemistry to show that PKCalpha and PKCbetaI were located in the nerve terminals, whereas PKCalpha and PKCbetaII were located in the postsynaptic and the Schwann cells. Stimulation and contraction do not change these cellular distributions, but our results show that the localization of classical PKC isoforms in the membrane is affected by synaptic activity.


The Prevalence and Spectrum of Î±-Thalassemia in Guizhou Province of South China.

The hypotensive effect of acute and chronic AMP-activated protein kinase activation in normal and hyperlipidemic mice. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is present in the arterial wall and is activated in response to cellular stressors that raise AMP relative to ADP/ATP. Activation of AMPK in vivo lowers blood pressure but the influence of hyperlipidemia on this response has not been studied. ApoE(-/-) mice on high fat diet for 6weeks and age-matched controls were treated with the AMPK activator, AICAR daily for two weeks. Under anesthesia, the carotid artery was cannulated for blood pressure measurements. Aortic tissue was removed for in vitro functional experiments and AMPK activity was measured in artery homogenates by Western blotting. ApoE(-/-) mice had significantly raised mean arterial pressure; chronic AICAR treatment normalized this but had no effect in normolipidemic mice, whereas acute administration of AICAR lowered mean arterial pressure in both groups. Chronic AICAR treatment increased phosphorylation of AMPK and its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase in normolipidemic but not ApoE(-/-) mice. In aortic rings, AMPK activation induced vasodilation and an anticontractile effect, which was attenuated in ApoE(-/-) mice. This study demonstrates that hyperlipidemia dysregulates the AMPK pathway in the arterial wall but this effect can be reversed by AMPK activation, possibly through improving vessel compliance.

Fading immune protection in old age: vaccination in the elderly. The function of the immune system declines with age, leading to an increased occurrence and severity of infectious diseases and a decreased response to vaccines. As the thymus gradually loses its ability to replenish the population of naÃ¯ve T cells, the memory and effector T cells increase in number and dominate the repertoire. The changes in the naÃ¯ve and memory T cell pool that occur with ageing in man are discussed here, along with a brief update of the knowledge of B cell populations in the elderly.

Mimicking the lipid peroxidation inhibitory activity of phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (GPx4) by using fatty acid conjugates of a water-soluble selenolane. A series of fatty acid conjugates of trans-3,4-dihydroxy-1-selenolane (DHS) were synthesized by reacting DHS with appropriate acid chlorides. The obtained monoesters were evaluated for their antioxidant capacities by the lipid peroxidation assay using a lecithin/cholesterol liposome as a model system. The observed antioxidant capacities against accumulation of the lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) increased with increasing the alkyl chain length and became saturated for dodecanoic acid (C12) or higher fatty acid monoesters, for which the capacities were much greater than those of DHS, its tridecanoic acid (C13) diester, and PhSeSePh. On the other hand, the bacteriostatic activity of myristic acid (C14) monoester, evaluated through the colony formation assay using Bacillus subtilis, indicated that it has higher affinity to bacterial cell membranes than parent DHS. Since DHS-fatty acid conjugates would inhibit lipid peroxidation through glutathione peroxidase (GPx)-like 2e- mechanism, higher fatty acid monoesters of DHS can mimic the function of GPx4, which interacts with LOOH to reduce it to harmless alcohol (LOH). Importance of the balance between hydrophilicity and lipophilicity for the design of effective GPx4 mimics was suggested. 

The controversial role of B-vitamins in cardiovascular risk: An update. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in Western countries. Since 1969, homocysteine has been implicated in the atherosclerotic process, and numerous observational studies have suggested that hyperhomocysteinaemia should be considered as an independent cardiovascular risk factor. B-vitamins, particularly folic acid, reduce homocysteine levels effectively; it was suggested, therefore, that supplementation with these vitamins might decrease cardiovascular risk and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with stroke, coronary heart disease and peripheral artery disease. However, the results of clinical trials conducted to investigate this issue have been inconsistent. This review discusses the findings of these trials and provides an updated overview on the 'homocysteine hypothesis'.

Down syndrome acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a highly heterogeneous disease in which aberrant expression of CRLF2 is associated with mutated JAK2: a report from the International BFM Study Group. We report gene expression and other analyses to elucidate the molecular characteristics of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in children with Down syndrome (DS). We find that by gene expression DS-ALL is a highly heterogeneous disease not definable as a unique entity. Nevertheless, 62% (33/53) of the DS-ALL samples analyzed were characterized by high expression of the type I cytokine receptor CRLF2 caused by either immunoglobulin heavy locus (IgH@) translocations or by interstitial deletions creating chimeric transcripts P2RY8-CRLF2. In 3 of these 33 patients, a novel activating somatic mutation, F232C in CRLF2, was identified. Consistent with our previous research, mutations in R683 of JAK2 were identified in 10 specimens (19% of the patients) and, interestingly, all 10 had high CRLF2 expression. Cytokine receptor-like factor 2 (CRLF2) and mutated Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) cooperated in conferring cytokine-independent growth to BaF3 pro-B cells. Intriguingly, the gene expression signature of DS-ALL is enriched with DNA damage and BCL6 responsive genes, suggesting the possibility of B-cell lymphocytic genomic instability. Thus, DS confers increased risk for genetically highly diverse ALLs with frequent overexpression of CRLF2, associated with activating mutations in the receptor itself or in JAK2. Our data also suggest that the majority of DS children with ALL may benefit from therapy blocking the CRLF2/JAK2 pathways.

Proteomics of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Organelles. Knowledge of the subcellular localization of proteins is indispensable to understand their physiological roles. In the past decade, 18 studies have been performed to analyze the protein content of isolated organelles from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Here, we integrate the data sets and compare them with other large scale studies on protein localization and abundance. We evaluate the completeness and reliability of the organelle proteomics studies. Reliability depends on the purity of the organelle preparations, which unavoidably contain (small) amounts of contaminants from different locations. Quantitative proteomics methods can be used to distinguish between true organellar constituents and contaminants. Completeness is compromised when loosely or dynamically associated proteins are lost during organelle preparation and also depends on the sensitivity of the analytical methods for protein detection. There is a clear trend in the data from the 18 organelle proteomics studies showing that proteins of low abundance frequently escape detection. Proteins with unknown function or cellular abundance are also infrequently detected, indicating that these proteins may not be expressed under the conditions used. We discuss that the yeast organelle proteomics studies provide powerful lead data for further detailed studies and that methodological advances in organelle preparation and in protein detection may help to improve the completeness and reliability of the data.

Diagnosis and management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, part 1: diagnosis, and pharmacological and psychosocial management. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe, progressive disease that affects 1 in 3600-6000 live male births. Although guidelines are available for various aspects of DMD, comprehensive clinical care recommendations do not exist. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention selected 84 clinicians to develop care recommendations using the RAND Corporation-University of California Los Angeles Appropriateness Method. The DMD Care Considerations Working Group evaluated assessments and interventions used in the management of diagnostics, gastroenterology and nutrition, rehabilitation, and neuromuscular, psychosocial, cardiovascular, respiratory, orthopaedic, and surgical aspects of DMD. These recommendations, presented in two parts, are intended for the wide range of practitioners who care for individuals with DMD. They provide a framework for recognising the multisystem primary manifestations and secondary complications of DMD and for providing coordinated multidisciplinary care. In part 1 of this Review, we describe the methods used to generate the recommendations, and the overall perspective on care, pharmacological treatment, and psychosocial management.

[Allergic sensitization profile in 0-5 year old children with wheezing and/or atopic dermatitis]. Although allergic diseases are frequent in childhood, few studies have characterised the IgE sensitization profile among young children with allergic-like symptoms. To determine the prevalence and the type of allergic sensitization, as well as the demographic and environmental factors related to both characteristics, among 0-5 year old children presenting with wheezing and/or atopic dermatitis. Collaborative cross-over study developed in the paediatric setting of 20 Spanish Primary Health Care Centres. An allergology evaluation including blood determination of specific IgE antibodies to common inhalant and food allergens was performed on 468 children who presented with wheezing and/or atopic dermatitis. Allergic sensitization was detected in 32.4% of the children with wheezing (95% confidence interval, 95%CI, 26.3-38.6%), in 54.8% of the children who had atopic dermatitis (95%CI, 42.1-67.6%) and in 39.2% of the children with both processes (95%CI, 32.0-46.4%). The risk of allergic sensitization was sex related (male versus female adjusted odds ratio, OR(A), 1.91, 95%CI, 1.24-2.95), and also related to the age (3-5 versus 0-2 year old OR(A) 1.96, 95%CI, 1.27-3.0), type of early feeding (maternal milk versus infant formula OR(A) 0.51, 95%CI, 0.31-0.84) and geoclimatic area (OR(A) Continental versus Atlantic 2.26, 95%CI, 1.30-3.93). Compared to the Atlantic area, the Continental area the sensitization was lower to mites (OR(A) 0.16, 95%CI, 0.07-0.36) and higher to grass (OR(A) 4.65, 95%CI 1.99-10.86), cow milk (OR(A) 5.17, 95%CI, 1.71-15.62) and egg (OR(A) 5.26, 95%CI, 2.04-13.62), whereas in the Mediterranean area the sensitization was lower to mites (OR(A) 0.29, 95%CI, 0.13-0.64) and higher to cow milk (OR(A) 3.81, 95%CI, 1.20-12.14) and egg (OR(A) 5.24, 95%CI, 1.94-14.20). A significant proportion of small children treated at the paediatric primary health care centres due to wheezing and/or atopic dermatitis had allergic sensitization. There appears to be a geoclimatic variation in the prevalence of sensitization to inhalant and food allergens among young children with allergic like symptoms who live in Spain.

Associations of birthweight and gestational age with reproductive and metabolic phenotypes in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome and their first-degree relatives. Low birthweight has been associated with metabolic and reproductive abnormalities in adults. The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between birthweight and gestational age and its association with reproductive and metabolic phenotypes in women with PCOS and their first-degree relatives. We conducted a family-based study of PCOS at an academic health center. A total of 1038 individuals (845 females and 193 males) from the cohort and 168 controls participated in the study. The association between birthweight and familial phenotype was measured. Self-reported and actual birthweight were highly correlated [Spearman correlation coefficient (r) = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66, 0.89; P = 0.001) and concordant (concordance correlation coefficient = 0.86; 95% lower limit = 0.78). We noted that birthweight for both genders in PCOS families and controls fell within the 10th and 90th percentiles for gestational age based on U.S. population norms. The 50th percentiles for a gestational age of 40 wk were very similar (3409 g in PCOS, 3455 g for controls, and 3495 g for the United States). There were no significant associations between phenotype and birthweight in PCOS probands. Furthermore, there were not any significant relationships between phenotype and birthweight in female or male family members of the PCOS probands. Birthweight in PCOS families mirrors control and U.S. population data, even corrected for gestational age, and has no substantive association with reproductive and metabolic abnormalities in women with PCOS, their female relatives, or their male relatives.

Semiautomated segmentation of kidney from high-resolution multidetector computed tomography images using a graph-cuts technique. To develop a semiautomated segmentation method based on a graph-cuts technique from multidetector computed tomography images for kidney segmentation and to evaluate and compare it with the conventional manual delineation segmentation method. We have developed a semiautomated segmentation method that is based on a graph-cuts technique with enhanced features including automated seed growing. Multidetector computed tomography images were obtained from 15 consecutive patients who were being evaluated as possible living donors for kidney transplant. Two observers independently performed the segmentation of the kidney from the multidetector computed tomography images using the manual and semiautomated methods. The efficiency of the 2 methods were measured by segmentation processing times and then compared. The interobserver and method reproducibility was determined by Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), which measures how closely 2 segmented volumes overlap geometrically and the coefficient of variation of volume measurements. The mean segmentation processing time was (manual vs semiautomated, P < 0.001) 96.8 +/- 13.6 vs 13.7 +/- 3.5 minutes for observer 1 and 44.3 +/- 4.7 vs 16.2 +/- 5.1 minutes for observer 2. The mean interobserver reproducibility was (manual vs semiautomated, P < 0.001) 93.6 +/- 1.6% vs 97.3 +/- 0.9% for DSC and 5.3 +/- 2.6% vs 2.2 +/- 1.3% for coefficient of variation, indicating higher interobserver reproducibility with the semiautomated than manual method. The agreement between the 2 segmentation methods was high (mean intermethod DSC 95.8 +/- 1.0% and 94.9 +/- 0.8%) for both observers. The semiautomated method was significantly more efficient and reproducible than the manual delineation method for segmentation of kidney from MDCT images.


Target-distractor interference in the attentional blink implicates the locus coeruleus-norepinephrine system.

Hyperintensity signal in the joint space of the temporomandibular joint on fat-saturated T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. Our aim was to investigate the incidence of a hyperintense signal in the joint space of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) on fat-saturated T2-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs). We studied 112 patients (224 joints) with disorders of the TMJ who were examined by T2-weighted MRI, and recorded the association between displacement of the disc and the hyperintense signal using the Îº coefficient. A hyperintense signal was found in 4 of 91 joints (4%) when the disc was in the normal position, in all 19 joints with anterior disc displacement with reduction, and in 108 of the 114 joints (95%) with anterior disc displacement without reduction. There was a significant correlation between displacement of the disc and the hyperintense signal (p<0.001). The Îº coefficient was 0.91. Such a signal in the joint space of the TMJ on fat-saturated T2-weighted MRI may indicate the presence of synovial fluid in the joint space with displacement of the disc.

Automated segmentation for patella from lateral knee X-ray images. X-ray image segmentation is an important issue in medical image analysis. Due to inconsistent X-ray absorption, the intensities are usually unevenly distributed and noisy in the processed organ, thus the object segmentation becomes difficult. In this paper we propose a new segmentation method for patella from the lateral knee X-ray images based on the active shape model (ASM). At first, a patella shape model is constructed by principal component analysis (PCA) of corresponding landmarks obtained from a set of training shape. As the knee X-ray image usually contains many anatomical structures, we design a strategy based on edge tracing to place the initial shape model as close to the patella boundary as possible. Then, the shape model is deformed and fitted to the patella boundary by using a dual-optimization approach that includes a genetic algorithm (GA) to get the global geometric transform and ASM to deform the shape model iteratively. Consequently, the proposed method can cope with different knee X-ray images and can segment the patella in an automatic procedure. In the experiment, 20 images were tested and promising results are obtained by the proposed method. This method is found useful for the clinical evaluation and biomechanical study of knee.

Use of color flow Doppler ultrasonography to diagnose a bleeding neuroendocrine tumor in the gallbladder of a dog. A 13-year-old neutered female Keeshond-cross was evaluated because of a history of melena, anemia, hematemesis, vomiting, and high serum liver enzyme activities over a 1.5-year period. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a hyperechoic mass in the gallbladder. In the gallbladder mass itself, a distinct linear blood flow pattern was detected by use of color flow Doppler ultrasonography. A cholecystectomy was performed, and clinical signs resolved. Samples of the mass were examined histologically and immunohistochemically, and findings supported a diagnosis of neuroendocrine tumor of the gallbladder. Tumors of the biliary tree are a potential source of blood loss into the gastrointestinal tract. Color flow Doppler ultrasonography in conjunction with conventional grayscale ultrasonography may be useful in evaluation of the gallbladder in dogs. When echogenic material is detected in the gallbladder, it is important to evaluate the region for blood flow.

Latent deprivation among people who are employed, unemployed, or out of the labor force. Using a Web-based survey, the authors tested M. Jahoda's (1981, 1982, 1997) latent deprivation model among employed, unemployed, and out-of-the-labor-force (OLF) people. The model predicted that employment is the main provider of 5 specific subconstructs of experience important to mental health: time structure, social contact, collective purpose, status, and activity. As expected, deprivation of these latent functions correlated with distress not only among employed and unemployed people, but also among OLF people. OLF people reported significantly more latent deprivation than did employed people, but they reported significantly less latent deprivation than did unemployed people. Furthermore, latent deprivation mediated the negative effects of unemployment and OLF status on mental health. When the authors statistically controlled the influence of manifest deprivation, the effect of latent deprivation on mental health remained stable.

Adolescents' response to text-only tobacco health warnings: results from the 2008 UK Youth Tobacco Policy Survey. As of June 2009 most (89%) European Union member states continue to use mandated text-only health warnings on tobacco products. This study assessed adolescent (aged 11-16 years) perceptions of and reactions to these text warnings on cigarette packs in the UK. Data comes from wave five of the cross-sectional Youth Tobacco Policy Survey in 2008. A total of 1401 adolescents were recruited and health warnings were assessed in terms of salience (noticing, reading), comprehension and credibility, memorability (recall), depth of processing (contemplating, discussing) and persuasiveness (put off smoking, make more likely to stop). Smokers were also asked about behavioural compliance (foregoing cigarettes due to warnings, avoidance of warnings) and perceptions of harm from their smoking (to indirectly assess possible knowledge gained from warnings). Despite moderately high salience of warnings, memorability and, in particular, depth of processing was quite low, with warnings only sometimes thought about and very rarely discussed. Warnings were however considered comprehensible, credible and a reasonable deterrent for occasional and never smokers. Additionally, a third of regular smokers indicated that, in the last month, warnings had stopped them from having a cigarette. However, only 6% of smokers indicated that warnings made them forego cigarettes frequently. Text warnings help to communicate the dangers associated with smoking and, resultantly, prompt a small number of smokers to forgo cigarettes and take action to avoid warnings, but depth of processing is low and warnings do not appear to be achieving their full potential among smokers.

The combined use of risperidone long-acting injection and clozapine in patients with schizophrenia non-adherent to clozapine: a case series. Poor adherence to clozapine treatment represents an important problem in clinical practice because additional useful treatment options are unavailable. Although switching to risperidone long-acting injection (RLAI) has been recommended for those with compliance problems, this medication has been found to be less suitable for patients who previously received clozapine. Based on the suggested beneficial effects of RLAI, such as higher rates of treatment continuation and patient satisfaction, and the possible effectiveness of oral risperidone augmentation, it seems worthwhile to try RLAI augmentation for clozapine non-adherence. In this article, we present the cases of four patients with schizophrenia undergoing combined treatment with RLAI and clozapine for more than one year after multiple relapses related to clozapine non-adherence. Durations and frequencies of hospitalizations markedly declined after RLAI augmentation. Indeed, three patients receiving RLAI and clozapine for 1.2-3.5 years were never hospitalized during this period. The lengths of hospitalizations before and after augmenting with RLAI were 54.7 +/- 33.1 and 4.2 +/- 4.2 days/year, respectively. Participants also showed great improvements in social skills. These findings suggest the possible beneficial effects of RLAI augmentation in cases of clozapine nonadherence. However, controlled clinical trials are necessary to confirm whether RLAI augmentation represents a useful treatment option for patients who have not adhered to clozapine treatment.


Characterization of the polycomb group response elements of the Drosophila melanogaster invected Locus.

Parameters in panoramic radiography for differentiation of radiolucent lesions. The aims of this study were to establish parameters in panoramic radiography for interpretation of unilocular radiolucent lesions, and to compare the accuracy of diagnoses given by examiners before and after using these parameters. In Part I, 12 specialists analyzed 24 images and the diagnostic criteria used by each examiner to make correct diagnoses were used to build a list of basic radiographic parameters for each pathology (ameloblastoma, keratocystic odontogenic tumor, dentigerous cyst, and idiopathic bone cavity). In Part II, this list was used by 6 undergraduate students (Un), 8 recently graduated dentists (D), 3 oral pathologists, 3 stomatologists, 3 oral radiologists, and 3 oral surgeons to diagnose the corresponding pathologies in the other set of 24 panoramic radiographs (T2). The same analysis occurred without using this list (T1). The method of generalized estimating equations (GEE) was used in order to estimate the probability of making a correct diagnosis depending on the specialty of the examiner, type of lesion, and moment of the evaluation, T1 or T2 (before or after they had access to the list of parameters, respectively). Higher values were obtained for the probability (GEE) of making a correct diagnosis on T2; the group Un presented the highest improvement (14.6 %); no differences between the probabilities were observed either between Un and D, or among the different groups of specialists. The use of panoramic radiographic parameters did allow improving the diagnostic accuracy for all groups of examiners.

Metabolic risk factors among medicaid outpatients with schizophrenia receiving second-generation antipsychotics. Schizophrenia is associated with significant reductions in life expectancy, largely because of the increased incidence of cardiovascular disease. This study examined the prevalence of metabolic risk factors for cardiovascular disease among Medicaid recipients diagnosed as having schizophrenia and taking second-generation antipsychotics (medications associated with increased risk of metabolic abnormalities contributing to cardiovascular disease). Fifteen community health centers in King County, Washington, identified 1,317 eligible individuals, of whom 819 completed screenings for obesity, impaired fasting glucose levels or diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Fasting serum levels were obtained for 675 individuals, of whom 90% were diagnosed as having at least one risk factor, with elevated body mass index and dyslipidemia the most prevalent factors. About one-third of the individuals approached to participate did not obtain laboratory work necessary for the screening. The study indicates that this population has a high rate of metabolic risk of cardiovascular disease and that treatment will require addressing barriers to screening.


Expression of galectin-1 in immune cells and glial cells after spinal cord injury.

A prospective open-label study of endovascular treatment of chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency. Chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency (CCSVI) is characterized by combined stenoses of the principal pathways of extracranial venous drainage, including the internal jugular veins (IJVs) and the azygous (AZY) vein, with development of collateral circles and insufficient drainage shown by increased mean transit time in cerebral magnetic resonance (MR) perfusion studies. CCSVI is strongly associated with multiple sclerosis (MS). This study evaluated the safety of CCSVI endovascular treatment and its influence on the clinical outcome of the associated MS. Sixty-five consecutive patients with CCSVI, subdivided by MS clinical course into 35 with relapsing remitting (RR), 20 with secondary progressive (SP), and 10 with primary progressive (PP) MS, underwent percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA). Mean follow-up was 18 months. Vascular outcome measures were postoperative complications, venous pressure, and patency rate. Neurologic outcome measures were cognitive and motor function assessment, rate of MS relapse, rate of MR active positive-enhanced gadolinium MS lesions (Gad+), and quality of life (QOL) MS questionnaire. Outpatient endovascular treatment of CCSVI was feasible, with a minor and negligible complication rate. Postoperative venous pressure was significantly lower in the IJVs and AZY (P < .001). The risk of restenosis was higher in the IJVs compared with the AZY (patency rate: IJV, 53%; AZY, 96%; odds ratio, 16; 95% confidence interval, 3.5-72.5; P < .0001). CCSVI endovascular treatment significantly improved MS clinical outcome measures, especially in the RR group: the rate of relapse-free patients changed from 27% to 50% postoperatively (P < .001) and of MR Gad+ lesions from 50% to 12% (P < .0001). The Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite at 1 year improved significantly in RR patients (P < .008) but not in PP or SP. Physical QOL improved significantly in RR (P < .01) and in PP patients (P < .03), with a positive trend in SP (P < .08). Mental QOL showed significant improvement in RR (P < .003) and in PP (P < .01), but not in SP. PTA of venous strictures in patients with CCSVI is safe, and especially in patients with RR, the clinical course positively influenced clinical and QOL parameters of the associated MS compared with the preoperative assessment. Restenosis rates are elevated in the IJVs but very promising in the AZY, suggesting the need to improve endovascular techniques in the former. The results of this pilot study warrant a subsequent randomized control study.

Characterization of the cytokine and maturation responses of pure populations of porcine plasmacytoid dendritic cells to porcine viruses and toll-like receptor agonists. Plausible representatives of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) in pigs have been characterized as being CD4(hi)CD172(lo). Due to their paucity in blood, we utilized novel fluorescent-activated cell sorting procedures to isolate them from PBMC. The resultant subset was greater than 98% homogeneous in regards to the selected phenotype and contained the preponderance of individuals secreting IFN-alpha after exposure to a known stimulant, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV). In addition to being a potent source of IFN-alpha, other properties of these porcine CD4(hi)CD172(lo) cells including their morphological transition from a plasma cell-like shape during quiescence to one resembling a dendritic cell (DC) after activation by TGEV and their relatively strong constitutive expression of interferon regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7) conformed to the expectations of genuine pDCs. While a substantial IFN-alpha response was also elicited from the porcine pDCs by pseudorabies virus (PrV), swine influenza virus (SIV), and TLR7 and 9 agonists, there was an agent-dependent induction of varying amounts of IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha. Notably, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) failed to provoke the pDCs to secrete any of the measured cytokines except IL-2. Moreover, whereas pDCs exposed to TGEV or the TLR9 agonist rapidly increased IRF-7 production and morphed into DCs with enhanced CD80/86 expression, similar alterations were not observed during incubation with PRRSV. This atypical response of pDCs to PRRSV may contribute to its pathogenesis, which unlike that associated with PrV, SIV or TGEV includes persistent infection and limited development of protective immunity.

Postural Tachycardia Syndrome: Beyond Orthostatic Intolerance.

Possibility of sweet corn synthetic seed production. Somatic embryogenesis in sweet corn has been reported by a number of workers. However, the knowledge maintaining storage life, vigor and viability of these somatic embryos are limited. A model system of synchronous somatic embryos production combined with encapsulation to synthetic seed was studied in sweet corn (Zea mays var. saccharata). In this study immature zygotic embryo cultured on N6 medium, contained 2, 4-D 2 mg L(-1) and sucrose 60 g L(-1) form the embryogenic callus. Higher 2, 4-D levels did not show increasing in inducing embryogenic callus. If the concentration of 2, 4-D decreased globular-stage, somatic zygote form the roots. Somatic embryo develop without surrounding nutritive tissues and protective seed coat has been devoted to causing somatic embryos to functionally mimic embryo, then was encapsulated by 3% (w/v) sodium alginate with 4-6 mm in diameter. It was found that when synthetic seed were treated with 60 g L(-1) sucrose and stored at 15+/-2 degree Celsius for 2 weeks, the survival rate of synthetic seed were 44%, after 8 days of germination test, it was found that there were 91% of which were normal seedling and 9% were abnormal seedling. This result indicated that there is a possibility in sweet corn synthetic seed production. Anyhow, more research for better technique are further required.

Efficient algorithm development of CIS speech processing strategy for cochlear implants. Continuous Interleaved Sampling (CIS) is one of the most useful and famous speech processing strategies used in Cochlear Implant speech processors. However, algorithm realization in hardware is a laborious task due to high computation cost of the algorithm. Real-time issues and low-power design demands an optimized realization of algorithm. This paper proposes two techniques to cut the computation cost of CIS by using polyphase filters and by implementing the complete algorithm in frequency domain. About 70% reduction in computation cost can be achieved by using multi-rate, multistage filters; whereas computation cost decreases by a factor of five when the whole algorithm is implemented in frequency domain. Evaluation of the algorithm is done by a laboratory designed algorithm development and evaluation platform. Algorithm flow diagrams and their computation details have been given for comparison. Utilizing the given techniques can remarkably reduce the processor load without any compromise on quality.

A primer for nurses on advancing health reform policy. Health care reform is a high priority on the federal policy agenda. The authors present insights from their experiences as Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Health Policy Fellows working in Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office and on the House Committee on Ways and Means. Nursing has many opportunities at this juncture to engage in policy discussions and advance solutions for issues related to increasing quality and access while dampening the escalating cost of care. Strategies where nursing's voice can inform reform conversations include chronic disease management, prevention and health promotion, community-based care, nurse-managed care, interdisciplinary education, safety and quality, use of health information technology, and testing the comparative effectiveness of interventions and delivery systems.

Radiochemical synthesis and preliminary in vivo evaluation of new radioactive platinum complexes with carnosine. Application of cross-linking agents such as SATA and 2-iminothiolane (2-IT) for radiochemical synthesis of new radioactive Pt(II) and Pt(IV) complexes with carnosine was investigated. The mixed-ligand Pt(II)([(125)I]Hist)(Carnosine) complex has been synthesized in a multi-step reaction. First, carnosine was modified by the attachment of SATA. After chromatographic purification, the conjugate was unprotected to form a reactive sulfhydryl functional group, and then the modified carnosine was substituted to PtCl(2)[(125)I]Hist complex. The Pt(II)(IT-[(125)I]Carnosine) and Pt(IV)(IT-[(131)I]Carnosine) complexes were synthesized in a three-step reaction. First, carnosine was labeled with iodine radionuclide ((125)I or (131)I), followed by conjugation with 2-IT. The modified IT-[*I]Carnosine was complexed with tetrachloroplatinate or hexachloroplatinate. Comparative biodistribution studies were performed in normal Wistar rats and in Lewis rats with implanted (s.c.) rat pancreatic tumor cells (AR42J). The HPLC analysis showed a relatively fast formation of the new mixed-ligand Pt([(125)I]Hist)(Carnosine) complex (yield ca. 50% after 20h). Reaction of K(2)PtCl(4) with [(125)I]Carnosine modified by 2-IT proceeded rapidly and with a high yield (>95% after 2h). The synthesis of the Pt(IV)IT-[*I]Carnosine complex was the slower reaction in comparison to the analogous synthesis of the Pt(II) complex (yield ca. 70% after 12h), thus a purification step was necessary. The biodistribution study proved the in vivo stability of the newly synthesized complexes (a low accumulation in thyroid gland and in GIT) and showed that the conjugation of the modified carnosine changes significantly biodistribution scheme of the Pt complexes comparing to the reference Pt(II)[*I]Hist and Pt(IV)([*I]Hist)(2) complexes. The mixed-ligand complex was rapidly excreted in urine and revealed the highest accumulation in kidneys (>5%ID/g). A very high concentration in blood and in liver was observed for the Pt(II)(IT-[(125)I]Carnosine) complex; however, at the same time the lowest concentration in kidneys was noted. Preliminary studies in the rat's tumor model indicated for this complex a favorable tumor to muscle ratio. In the case of Pt(IV)(IT-[*I]Carnosine) apart from ca. 12-times decrease of the liver accumulation, additional 4-times decrease of an accumulation in kidneys was observed in comparison to the Pt(IV)([*I]Hist)(2) complex. Our study showed that the short peptides can be efficiently substituted to the platinum core via the reactive sulfhydryl group introduced by SATA or 2-IT. The new radioactive platinum complexes with carnosine possess favorable biodistribution schemes, which make them potential candidates for radio-chemotherapeutical agents.

Paediatric nurses' knowledge of palliative care in Florida: a quantitative study. Nurses routinely identify and suggest patients to physicians for possible referral to palliative care and discuss potential referrals with families. Knowledge of palliative care is essential for nurses, especially in paediatrics, where palliative care is less common than with adults. This study uses data from surveys from 279 paediatric nurses across Florida, USA. The palliative care quiz for nursing (PCQN) and the knowledge about hospice quiz (KHQ) were used. On the KHQ at least one-half of the nurses answered six out of seven questions correctly. On the PCQN at least one-half of the nurses answered 12 out of 20 questions correctly. Multivariate analyses show that receiving formal palliative care training and having worked at a hospice were associated with greater knowledge. Paediatric nurses in Florida have a good level of baseline knowledge of palliative care. Nurses' training programs should be used to increase knowledge, which may subsequently lead to more referrals.


Mutations in the three Arabidopsis genes that encode the E2 subunit of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex differentially affect enzymatic activity and plant growth.

Family-Based Benchmarking of Copy Number Variation Detection Software. The analysis of structural variants, in particular of copy-number variations (CNVs), has proven valuable in unraveling the genetic basis of human diseases. Hence, a large number of algorithms have been developed for the detection of CNVs in SNP array signal intensity data. Using the European and African HapMap trio data, we undertook a comparative evaluation of six commonly used CNV detection software tools, namely Affymetrix Power Tools (APT), QuantiSNP, PennCNV, GLAD, R-gada and VEGA, and assessed their level of pair-wise prediction concordance. The tool-specific CNV prediction accuracy was assessed in silico by way of intra-familial validation. Software tools differed greatly in terms of the number and length of the CNVs predicted as well as the number of markers included in a CNV. All software tools predicted substantially more deletions than duplications. Intra-familial validation revealed consistently low levels of prediction accuracy as measured by the proportion of validated CNVs (34-60%). Moreover, up to 20% of apparent family-based validations were found to be due to chance alone. Software using Hidden Markov models (HMM) showed a trend to predict fewer CNVs than segmentation-based algorithms albeit with greater validity. PennCNV yielded the highest prediction accuracy (60.9%). Finally, the pairwise concordance of CNV prediction was found to vary widely with the software tools involved. We recommend HMM-based software, in particular PennCNV, rather than segmentation-based algorithms when validity is the primary concern of CNV detection. QuantiSNP may be used as an additional tool to detect sets of CNVs not detectable by the other tools. Our study also reemphasizes the need for laboratory-based validation, such as qPCR, of CNVs predicted in silico. 

Preservation of Helicobacter pylori CagA Translocation and Host Cell Proinflammatory Responses in the Face of CagL Hypervariability at Amino Acid Residues 58/59. Carriage of the CagA oncoprotein by the human gastric cancer-associated pathogen Helicobacter pylori is significantly associated with this typically benign chronic infection advancing to a potentially fatal outcome. However it remains to be elucidated why only a small subset of individuals infected with H. pylori CagA-positive strains develops gastric cancer. H. pylori translocates CagA into host cells using a type IV secretion apparatus that interacts with host integrin receptors via a three-amino-acid-residue RGD motif on the H. pylori protein CagL. The RGD motif of CagL also plays a major role in the induction of proinflammatory responses. Upstream of this motif is a conserved glycine flanked by four hypervariable amino acid residues (residues 58, 59, 61 and 62). Certain amino acid polymorphisms at 58 and 59 are significantly prevalent in strains from gastric cancer patients in particular geographic regions; Y58E59 is seen in Taiwan and D58K59 in India. In light of the seemingly contradictory findings of recent CagL mutagenesis studies, we have examined the contribution of sequence promiscuity specifically at CagL residues 58 and 59 to CagA translocation and H. pylori-mediated proinflammatory responses of gastric epithelial cells. Using isogenic mutants of H. pylori strains P12 and 26695 with amino acid substitutions at CagL residues 58 and 59, we determined that carriage of the polymorphisms Y58E59, D58K59, D58E59, N58E59 or N58K59 did not significantly alter the capacity of H. pylori to translocate CagA into, or induce IL-8 secretion in, host cells. Our findings, together with other recently published data, suggest that the variation at CagL residues 58 and 59 does not influence type IV secretion system function in isolation, but rather may work in concert with particular polymorphisms elsewhere in CagL to modulate disease progression.

Children's asthma hospitalizations and relative risk due to nitrogen dioxide (NO2): effect modification by race, ethnicity, and insurance status. This study explores the role of race, ethnicity, and insurance status in modifying the effects of air pollution on children's asthma hospitalizations in Phoenix, Arizona (US) between 2001 and 2003. While controlling for weather, interactions between nitrous dioxide (NO(2)) and race, ethnicity, and insurance status are used to predict relative risk for subgroups of children. The generalized logit regression model for nominal categorical data within a multinomial likelihood framework was used. This model is specifically suited to small counts and the reporting of 95% confidence intervals for the odds ratio of hospital admission for one group as compared to another. The odds ratio is known to approximate relative risk for rare events. Several significant findings were found for race, ethnicity, and insurance status as modulators for the effect of NO(2) on children's risk for asthma hospitalization: (1) children without insurance have 1.4 (95% CI: 1.1-1.8) times higher risk of asthma admissions than those with private insurance at exceedances of 0.02 parts per million (ppm) of NO(2) above the seasonal mean; the same finding holds for children without insurance as compared to those with Medicaid; (2) black children have 2.1 (95% CI: 1.3-3.3) times higher risk of hospitalization than Hispanic children at seasonal mean NO(2) levels, but this disproportionate risk shrinks to 1.7 with exceedances of 0.02 ppm of NO(2) above the seasonal mean. Specific to finding (1) among those children without health insurance, Hispanic children have 2.1 (95% CI: 1.1-3.8) times higher risk of hospitalization than white children. Among all Hispanic children, those without health insurance have 1.9 (95% CI: 1.3-3.0) times greater risk than those with private insurance; the same finding holds for Hispanic children without insurance as compared to Hispanic children with Medicaid. Specific to finding (2), among children with private insurance, the disproportionate risk of black children as compared to Hispanic children is magnified by a factor of 1.3 (95% CI: 1.0-1.8) for exceedances of 0.02 ppm of NO(2) above the seasonal mean. Although we cannot confirm a cause-effect relationship, this analysis suggests that increasing insurance enrollment for all children, and specifically Hispanic children, may reduce their disproportionate risk from exceedances of air pollution. There are few black children in Phoenix, so further studies are needed to investigate the increasing risk of black children with private insurance as compared to Hispanics at exceedances of NO(2).

Lymphocyte subsets in healthy Malawians: implications for immunologic assessment of HIV infection in Africa.

Automatic recognition of postures and activities in stroke patients. Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States. It is estimated that 700,000 people in the United States will experience a stroke each year and that there are over 5 million Americans living with a stroke. In this paper we describe a novel methodology for automatic recognition of postures and activities in patients with stroke that may be used to provide behavioral enhancing feedback to patients with stroke as part of a rehabilitation program and potentially enhance rehabilitation outcomes. The recognition methodology is based on Support Vector classification of the sensor data provided by a wearable shoe-based device. The proposed methodology was validated in a case study involving an individual with a chronic stroke with impaired motor function of the affected lower extremity and impaired walking ability. The results suggest that recognition of postures and activities may be performed with very high accuracy.


Evaluation of the conformational equilibrium of reduced hen egg lysozyme by antibodies to the native form.

The habitual meal and snacking patterns of university students in two countries and their use of vending machines. Dietary patterns and food choices in western and northern European countries can differ from those in countries that surround the Mediterranean basin. However, irregular meal patterns and the consumption of high-energy snacks tend to become common in most countries and their association with the prevalence of obesity has been examined in many studies. The first aim of the present study was to describe the habitual meal and snack intakes, including the use of vending machines, for two groups of first-year university students in two countries of different cultural backgrounds. The second aim was to explore the relationships between body mass index (BMI) and snacking for these two groups. One hundred and sixty first-year undergraduate university students from two defined universities in Greece (n = 80) and Scotland (n = 80) volunteered to complete a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The FFQ comprised 16 questions assessing their meal and snacking habits. Self-assessed height and weight data were collected. The majority of the 160 students reported a BMI in the healthy range (<25 kg m(-2)). Overall, 26% of the students reported never consuming breakfast. More Scottish students (74%) used vending machines (P < 0.05). More Scottish students consumed chocolate bars and crisps than Greek students (41% and 34% versus 37.5% and 20%, respectively). Only the choice of chocolate bars from vending machines and the consumption of crisps and low fat yogurts were related to BMI (P < 0.05) for both groups. University students living in different countries report similar dietary patterns but differ in their snacking habits. No relationships were found between BMI and snacking. There is a need to carry out research to further our understanding of this relationship.


Medicinally important secondary metabolites in recombinant microorganisms or plants: progress in alkaloid biosynthesis.

Augmentation of degenerated human cartilage in vitro using magnetically labeled mesenchymal stem cells and an external magnetic device. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether it is possible to regenerate degenerated human cartilage in vitro by use of magnetically labeled mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and an external magnetic device. MSCs from human bone marrow were cultured and magnetically labeled. Degenerated human cartilage was obtained during total knee arthroplasty. The osteochondral fragments were attached to the sidewall of tissue culture flasks, and magnetically labeled MSCs were injected into the flasks. By use of an external magnetic device, a magnetic force was applied for 6 hours to the direction of the cartilage, and then the degenerated cartilage was cultured in chondrogenic differentiation medium for 3 weeks. In the control group a magnetic force was not applied. The specimens were evaluated histologically. A cell layer was formed on the degenerated cartilage as shown by H&E staining. The cell layer was also stained in toluidine blue and safranin O and with anti-collagen type II immunostaining, indicating that the cell layer contained an extracellular matrix. In the control group a cell layer was not observed on the cartilage. We were able to show that our system could deliver MSCs onto degenerated human cartilage and then form an extracellular matrix on the degenerated cartilage in vitro. Our novel cell delivery system using magnetic force may lead toward a new treatment option for osteoarthritis.

Galactosemia, a single gene disorder with epigenetic consequences. Long-term outcomes of classic galactosemia (GAL) remain disappointing. It is unclear if the complications result mainly from prenatal-neonatal toxicity or persistent glycoprotein and glycolipid synthesis abnormalities. We performed gene expression profiling (T transcriptome) to characterize key-altered genes and gene clusters of four patients with GAL with variable outcomes maintained on a galactose-restricted diet, compared with controls. Significant perturbations of multiple cell signaling pathways were observed including mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling, regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesion, and ubiquitin mediated proteolysis. A number of genes significantly altered were further investigated in the GAL cohort including SPARC (osteonectin) and S100A8 (S100 calcium-binding protein). The whole serum N-glycan profile and IgG glycosylation status of 10 treated patients with GAL were compared with healthy control serum and IgG using a quantitative high-throughput analytical HPLC platform. Increased levels of agalactosylated and monogalactosylated structures and decreases in certain digalactosylated structures were identified in the patients. The persistent abnormal glycosylation of serum glycoproteins seen with the microarray data indicates persisting metabolic dyshomeostasis and gene dysregulation in "treated" GAL. Strict restriction of dietary galactose is clearly life saving in the neonatal period; long-term severe galactose restriction may contribute to ongoing systemic abnormalities.


Thrombus on the eustachian valve leading to recurrent pulmonary embolism: a rare problem requiring aggressive management.

Base-Promoted N-Pyridylation of Heteroarenes Using N-Propargyl Enaminones as Equivalents of Pyridine Scaffolds. N-Pyridylation of various N-heteroarenes, including N-heteroarene-containing peptides, was achieved using N-propargyl enaminones (isolated or generated in situ from propargyl amine and propynones) as masked polysubstituted pyridine cores. This metal-free procedure proceeds under mild reaction conditions and generates 1 equiv of H2O as the sole byproduct. 


Heightened flexor withdrawal response in individuals with knee osteoarthritis is modulated by joint compression and joint mobilization.

Quantitative detection of human adenoviruses in wastewater and combined sewer overflows influencing a Michigan river. Enteric viruses are important pathogens found in contaminated surface waters and have previously been detected in waters of the Great Lakes. Human adenoviruses were monitored because of their high prevalence and persistence in aquatic environments. In this study, we quantified adenoviruses in wastewater, surface water, and combined sewer overflows (CSOs) by real-time PCR. Between August 2005 and August 2006, adenovirus concentrations in raw sewage, primary-treated effluent, secondary-treated effluent, and chlorinated effluent from a wastewater treatment plant in Michigan were examined. CSO samples (n = 6) were collected from a CSO retention basin in Grand Rapids, MI. Adenoviruses were detected in 100% of wastewater and CSO discharge samples. Average adenovirus DNA concentrations in sewage and CSOs were 1.15 x 10(6) viruses/liter and 5.35 x 10(5) viruses/liter, respectively. Adenovirus removal was <2 log(10) (99%) at the wastewater treatment plant. Adenovirus type 41 (60% of clones), type 12 (29%), type 40 (3%), type 2 (3%), and type 3 (3%) were isolated from raw sewage and primary effluents (n = 28). Six of 20 surface water samples from recreational parks at the lower Grand River showed virus concentrations above the real-time PCR detection limit (average, 7.8 x 10(3) viruses/liter). This research demonstrates that wastewater effluents and wastewater-impacted surface waters in the lower Grand River in Michigan contain high levels of viruses and may not be suitable for full-body recreational activities. High concentrations of adenovirus in these waters may be due to inefficient removal during wastewater treatment and to the high persistence of these viruses in the environment.

Esophageal mucosal injury with low-dose aspirin and its prevention by rabeprazole. Aspirin is used widely as an antithrombotic drug for the prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Although aspirin increases the risk for gastrointestinal mucosal injury, the effect on esophageal mucosa is unclear. This study investigates whether aspirin induces esophageal mucosal injury and whether a proton-pump inhibitor can prevent such injury in relation to CYP2C19 genotypes. Fifteen healthy Japanese volunteers are dosed for 7 days in a 5-way randomly crossover trial: placebo, aspirin 100 mg, rabeprazole 10 mg, and aspirin 100 mg plus rabeprazole 10 mg either once daily or 4 times per day. All subjects undergo endoscopy and 24-hour intragastric pH monitoring on day 7. With the aspirin regimen, esophageal mucosal disorders occur in 7 patients (46.7%) (5, grade M; 2, grade A). The median 24-hour pH differs significantly among subjects who develop grade M or A gastroesophageal reflux disease and those who do not develop gastroesophageal reflux disease; the median pH in grade A gastroesophageal reflux disease is significantly lower (1.5 [range, 1.1-1.9]) than that in patients without gastroesophageal reflux disease (5.6 [range, 0.8-8.4], P = .04). Rabeprazole significantly inhibits acid secretion irrespective of CYP2C19 genotypes and decreases the incidence of aspirin-related esophageal injury and symptoms according to increasing pH value. Aspirin induces esophageal mucosal injury in an acid-dependent manner. Concomitant proton-pump inhibitor therapy may prevent advanced effects of low-dose aspirin.

[Regionalization and human development: a typology of health regions in Brazil]. This article aimed to present a proposal for characterizing health regions in Brazil based on human development, contributing to the identification of comparable geographic areas for observation, analysis, and monitoring of performance in regionalized health systems. The dimensions of the Municipal Human Development Index were calculated for the health regions by aggregating data from municipalities, weighted by population size. The grouping of health regions in 5 groups, based on combinations of life expectancy, income, and schooling, was determined by the K-Means method. Approximately half of Brazil's health regions were classified as type 1 and the other half as types 3 to 5. The typology provides a clustering model for homogeneous health regions, consistent with the theoretical assumptions of PROADESS. The choice of well-established indicators and aggregation methods tends to facilitate their comprehension and use by the actors involved in the administration of the Brazilian Unified National Health System (SUS). 

Prediction of novel isoforms of the mouse Mpv17l protein. The Mpv17l protein has two isoforms, M-LPL and M-LPS, which both regulate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and protect against mitochondrial oxidative stress and apoptosis. M-LPL is ubiquitously expressed, while M-LPS is expressed mostly in the kidney of aged animals. We identified a variety of transcripts of the Mpv17l gene that could encode novel isoforms by mapping expressed sequence tags on the mouse M-LP genomic locus. We analysed the expression and evolutionary conservation of a novel Mpv17l transcript (mpv17l-002) that is predicted to encode a new protein, termed M-LP2. The isoform M-LP2 has the full length of M-LPS plus six amino acids at the end of its amino terminus, which could be encoded by an alternative 5'-flanking sequence. We show that the mRNA of M-LP2 has a different pattern of expression than the mRNA of M-LPS, and sequences of both transcripts are conserved in the rodent genome; however, neither of these isoforms is detected in the human genome. These observations suggest that the functions of certain M-LP isoforms are tissue- and species-specific, implying that their potential involvement in ROS metabolism may be redundant or may be complemented by other members of the Mpv17 family.

A simple HPLC-UV method for the quantification of theophylline in rabbit plasma and its pharmacokinetic application. A simple, precise and accurate high-performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet method was developed and validated for the quantification of theophylline in rabbit plasma using hydroxyethyl theophylline as an internal standard. Separation was performed on Waters(Â®) C18 column (ÂµBondapakâ¢ 5 Âµm, 150 Ã 3.9 mm) using a mobile phase consisting of water-acetonitrile (96:4 v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Validation of the method was performed in order to demonstrate its selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy and stability. The calibration curves of theophylline were linear over a concentration range of 0.1-25 Âµg/mL. The within- and between-day coefficient of variation (CV) were <10%. The extraction recoveries of theophylline at the three levels of quality control samples were 63.1, 69.4 and 69.7%. The method was rapid with retention time of theophylline and the internal standard observed at â¼5.2 and 6.5 min, respectively. The developed method was applied successfully for studying the pharmacokinetics of theophylline in rabbits. 

Real-time identification and visualization of human segment parameters. Mass parameters of the body segments are mandatory to study motion dynamics. No systematic method to estimate them has been proposed so far. Rather, parameters are scaled from generic tables or estimated with methods inappropriate for in-patient care. Based on our previous works, we propose a real-time software that allows to estimate the whole-body segment parameters, and to visualize the progresses of the completion of the identification. The visualization is used as a feedback to optimize the excitation and thus the identification results. The method is experimentally tested.

Anterior exposure of the lumbar spine with and without an "access surgeon": morbidity analysis of 265 consecutive cases. Retrospective review To compare the incidence and type of exposure-related complications for anterior lumbar surgery performed with and without an "access" surgeon. No data exist comparing the incidence and type of exposure-related complications for anterior lumbar surgery performed with and without a vascular surgeon's assistance. A retrospective review was performed for 265 consecutive patients who underwent anterior lumbar spine surgery at our institution from 2003 to 2005. Each patient's records were reviewed for diagnosis, procedure, whether the surgical exposure was conducted by the spine surgeon (Spine) or with a vascular surgeon's assistance (Team), levels exposed, complications, and any lasting sequelae. The percentage of patients with at least 1 intraoperative complication was 8% and 12% for the Spine and Team cases, respectively. Two percent of the Spine patients experienced an intraoperative vascular complication compared with 7% of the Team cases. No intraoperative vascular complication occurred in the single-level Spine exposures. Four percent of the patients with single-level exposures with Team approaches sustained an intraoperative vascular complication. Eight percent of the multilevel Spine cases sustained an intraoperative vascular complication compared with 9% of the multilevel Team exposures. There were 14 vascular injuries appreciated intraoperatively in a total of 13 patients. These injuries were directly repaired in 10 patients without any residual sequelae. The rate of vascular complications was statistically higher for multiple-level exposures (9%) versus single-level exposure (3%; P = 0.0357). The rate of retrograde ejaculation was 6% in the Spine cases whereas it was 7% in the Team approach. Our results do not support the notion that the presence of an "access" surgeon will change the type and rate of complications. With adequate training and judgment, spine surgeons may safely perform such exposures, provided vascular surgical assistance is readily available.

Mitochondrial gene cytochrome b developmental and environmental expression in Aedes aegypti (Diptera: Culicidae). Cytochrome b, coded by mitochondrial DNA, is one of the cytochromes involved in electron transport in the respiratory chain of mitochondria. Cytochrome b is a critical intermediate in a mitochondrial death pathway. To reveal whether cytochrome b of the mosquito Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) (AeaCytB) is developmentally regulated, we used real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) to examine AeaCytB gene expression levels in different developmental stages of Ae. aegypti. The qPCR showed that AeaCytB was expressed in each developmental stage, with peaks at first and second instars and was highly expressed in teneral male and female Ae. aegypti adults. Because mitochondrial genes exist as multiple copies, AeaCytB has much higher expression levels in all developmental stages in Ae. aegypti compared with nuclear genes. We also investigated the effect of abiotic environmental factors (e.g., high temperatures, ultraviolet radiation, and pesticide) on AeaCytB gene expression. Taken together, these results suggest that AeaCytB gene plays an important role in the development of Ae. aegypti and its response to environmental stress.

Effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on scaffold-free ectopic bone formation in skeletal muscle. Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) is reported to have the effects of rapid appearance and early maturation of ossification in animal models. We examined the influence of LIPUS on bone formation in C57BL/6J mouse muscle induced by gene transfer of BMP-4 expression plasmid. Electroporation was employed to transfer plasmid DNA. First, an in vitro study was carried out to confirm that LIPUS has no effect on the forced expression of BMP-4 gene transferred by electroporation into C2C12 cells. Next, the BMP-4 plasmids were injected into mouse calf muscles, and transcutaneous electroporation was applied. LIPUS (30 mW/cm(2)) exposure was performed daily for 20 minutes on one side of hind limbs (LIPUS side). The contralateral limbs were not exposed to LIPUS (control side). Muscle samples were collected at 7, 10, 14, and 21 days after electroporation. Soft X-ray films of muscles were taken, and areas of bone formation were measured. After pepsin solubilization of the muscles, calcium and total collagen content were measured. Radiographical measurements showed significantly more bone formation in the LIPUS side at Day 10. The area of bone was the maximum in both sides at Day 14. The LIPUS side exhibited significant increase in the calcium content at Day 10. The total collagen content with LIPUS exposure was increased significantly over control at Day 10 and 21. According to these results, accelerated maturation of ectopic bone formation by LIPUS was confirmed at Day 10. Moreover, our results showed that LIPUS increases the total collagen content during osteogenesis.

Underestimation of obesity prevalence in Switzerland: comparison of two methods for correction of self-report. Studies using self-report may underestimate obesity prevalence because participants tend to overestimate their height, underestimate their weight and thus seriously underestimate their Body Mass Index (BMI). In order to find ways to adjust for this misestimation, we tested two correction methods for self-report by comparing the derived obesity prevalence rates with those based on measured height and weight. We used individual data from six studies based on self-reported BMI (1980-2007, n = 46589) and from five studies based on measured BMI (1977-2004, n = 20130). All studies were population-based samples and carried out in Switzerland. We limited to men and women aged 35 to 74 years. Obesity was defined as BMI > or =30 kg/m2. For correction method one, we used a lower BMI cutoff of 29.2 kg/m2 (for both sexes) for the definition of obesity; for method two, we adjusted weight and height (respecting age and sex) using equations that were derived from another population. Results were age-standardised. Differences were measured with a logistic regression model considering random effects. Adjustment of height and weight (method two) substantially approximated the BMI distribution based on unadjusted self-report to the BMI distribution based on measurement. In 2002/2003, obesity prevalence obtained with method two (men and women respectively: 16.3% and 13.0%) tended to be more similar to measured obesity prevalence (16.4% and 13.9%) than obesity prevalence obtained with method one (13.8% and 11.0%). Equation adjustment of self-reported weight and height provides an approximation of the real (measured) BMI distribution by sex and age and has advantages over the use of a universal lower cutoff level to adjust for self-report. However, to appropriately adjust for self-report, a Swiss-specific equation should be developed based on measured and self-reported heights and weights of the same individuals.

The schizophrenia susceptibility gene dysbindin controls synaptic homeostasis. The molecular mechanisms that achieve homeostatic stabilization of neural function remain largely unknown. To better understand how neural function is stabilized during development and throughout life, we used an electrophysiology-based forward genetic screen and assessed the function of more than 250 neuronally expressed genes for a role in the homeostatic modulation of synaptic transmission in Drosophila. This screen ruled out the involvement of numerous synaptic proteins and identified a critical function for dysbindin, a gene linked to schizophrenia in humans. We found that dysbindin is required presynaptically for the retrograde, homeostatic modulation of neurotransmission, and functions in a dose-dependent manner downstream or independently of calcium influx. Thus, dysbindin is essential for adaptive neural plasticity and may link altered homeostatic signaling with a complex neurological disease.


The N- and C-terminal domains of parathyroid hormone-related protein affect differently the osteogenic and adipogenic potential of human mesenchymal stem cells.

The HD-exchange motions of ribosomal protein S6 are insensitive to reversal of the protein-folding pathway. An increasing number of protein structures are found to encompass multiple folding nuclei, allowing their structures to be formed by several competing pathways. A typical example is the ribosomal protein S6, which comprises two folding nuclei (sigma1 and sigma2) defining two competing pathways in the folding energy landscape: sigma1 --> sigma2 and sigma2 --> sigma1. The balance between the two pathways, and thus the order of folding events, is easily controlled by circular permutation. In this study, we make use of this ability to manipulate the folding pathway to demonstrate that the dynamic motions of the S6 structure are independent of how the protein folds. The HD-exchange protection factors remain the same upon complete reversal of the folding order. The phenomenon arises because the HD-exchange motions and the high-energy excitations controlling the folding pathway occur at separated free-energy levels: the Boltzmann distribution of unproductive unfolding attempts samples all unfolding channels in parallel, even those that end up in excessively high barriers. Accordingly, the findings provide a simple rationale for how to interpret native-state dynamics without the need to invoke fluctuations off the normal unfolding reaction coordinate.

Cell fate decisions are specified by the dynamic ERK interactome. Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) controls fundamental cellular functions, including cell fate decisions. In PC12, cells shifting ERK activation from transient to sustained induces neuronal differentiation. As ERK associates with both regulators and effectors, we hypothesized that the mechanisms underlying the switch could be revealed by assessing the dynamic changes in ERK-interacting proteins that specifically occur under differentiation conditions. Using quantitative proteomics, we identified 284 ERK-interacting proteins. Upon induction of differentiation, 60 proteins changed their binding to ERK, including many proteins that were not known to participate in differentiation. We functionally characterized a subset, showing that they regulate the pathway at several levels and by different mechanisms, including signal duration, ERK localization, feedback, crosstalk with the Akt pathway and differential interaction and phosphorylation of transcription factors. Integrating these data with a mathematical model confirmed that ERK dynamics and differentiation are regulated by distributed control mechanisms rather than by a single master switch.

Zinc-specific food frequency questionnaire to assess college women's eating habits. Zinc deficiency has been reported in individuals with eating disorders, the risks of which increase during the adolescent and early adult years. A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) specific for zinc-rich foods was tested for its usefulness in identifying problematic eating behaviour tendencies in college-age women. Ninety-two female students enrolled in a university introductory psychology course volunteered to complete demographic information, the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT-26), and a zinc-specific FFQ (ZnFFQ). Relationships among estimated zinc intakes, food/lifestyle habits, and eating attitude variables were examined. Twenty-five women had estimated intakes below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for zinc. Individuals in the highest zinc intake group (over twice the RDA) had a tendency to score higher on the EAT-26 and the bulimia subscale. Vegetarians also scored high on the EAT-26. Although our data are limited, the ZnFFQ should be studied further to determine whether it could play a useful role in identifying individuals at risk for bulimia. The ZnFFQ is a simple, non-confrontational assessment tool and may be a helpful starting point for identifying women with unhealthy eating habits.

Executive function in body dysmorphic disorder. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a poorly understood disorder that involves a preoccupation with imagined or minor bodily defects. Only a few studies of neuropsychological function have been conducted. Two previous studies have indicated executive dysfunction in BDD. The current study sought to further define these executive deficits. Fourteen DSM-IV BDD patients and 14 age- and sex-matched control participants took part. Because of the high incidence of co-morbidity in BDD, patients with co-morbid Axis I disorders were not excluded. Control participants had no history of psychiatric illness. All participants completed the following executive function (EF) tests: Spatial Span (SS), Spatial Working Memory (SWM) and the Stockings of Cambridge (SOC) task. They also completed the Pattern Recognition (PR) test, a test of visual memory (VM). BDD participants made significantly more between-search errors on the SWM task, an effect that increased with task difficulty. Between-search errors are an example of poor maintenance and manipulation of information. SOC results indicated slower subsequent thinking times (i.e. the time taken to plan) in BDD participants. There were no group differences in SS or PR scores. The severity of BDD, depressive or anxiety symptoms was not correlated with performance on any of the cognitive tasks. The results of this study indicate that BDD patients have EF deficits in on-line manipulation, planning and organization of information. By contrast, spatial memory capacity, motor speed and visual memory were intact. Considered with evidence from lesion and neuroimaging studies, these results suggest frontal lobe dysfunction in BDD.

Determinants of body weight gain and association with neurodevelopmental outcome in infants operated for congenital heart disease. The aim of this prospective study was to examine the determinants of growth failure and the association with neurodevelopmental outcome in infants undergoing open-heart surgery. In 107 infants undergoing open-heart surgery for congenital heart disease (CHD), we evaluated weight at birth, at surgery, and at one year of age (expressed as z-scores). Neurodevelopmental status was assessed before surgery and at one year of age. Median age at surgery was 3.9 months (range: 0.1-10.2). Mean [+/-standard deviation (S.D.)] weight z-score at birth was -0.27 (+/-1.45), before surgery -1.34 (+/-1.45) (P<0.001 vs. birth weight), and at one year -0.86 (+/-1.35), (P<0.001 vs. weight at surgery). Poor preoperative weight (<10th percentile) was associated with genetic disorders [odds ratio (OR) 5.9, P<0.001], preoperative neurological abnormalities (OR 3.41, P<0.05), and older age at surgery (OR 1.01, P<0.05). Weight <10th percentile at one year was associated with the same factors as poor preoperative weight, however, also with risk adjustment for congenital heart surgery-1 (RACHS) score >3 (OR 3.22, P<0.05). Neurodevelopmental outcome at one year was not determined by growth failure. In conclusion, impaired body weight gain before surgery is followed by a catch-up growth after surgery. However, there is no relationship to neurodevelopmental outcome. Genetic comorbidity is the most significant factor for poor weight gain.

New psycho-pedagogic approach to obesity treatment: a 5-year follow-up. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the body weight evolution in obese patients admitted for a 2-week residential program and followed-up on ambulatory basis, as well as to evaluate factors having impact on weight evolution after 5 years. Thirty-nine obese patients participated in a 2-week structured interdisciplinary weight loss program, involving individual and group therapies, and including physical activity, nutritional education and standard cognitive-behavioral techniques. Patients were then followed-up regularly by their general practitioners for 5 years. After 5 years, 33 subjects completed the study. Seventy percent of the patients lost weight or maintained their weight loss. Total score for dietary structure, eating behavior disorders, dietary surveillance and weight management strategies, as evaluated by a validated questionnaire, was significantly lower in the weight loss group (22.4+/-4.3) as compared to maintenance group (24.4+/-6.1, p<0.05) and regain group (29.7+/-4.0, p<0.01). Patients who lost weight presented a more important follow-up on long-term weight management (p<0.05), a better dietary results (p<0.01) as well as more physical activity (p<0.05) that the regain group. The present study demonstrated that an initial multidimensional and multidisciplinary in-hospital program with a consecutive long-term ambulatory follow-up may lead to a significant weight loss (55%) and/or weight maintenance (15%). A multidisciplinary and well-designed initial treatment and long-term follow-up program is mandatory for obesity management.

Optimizing of transcoronary pacing in a porcine model. Transcoronary pacing for the treatment of bradycardia during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is not well established, but may be a useful technique in interventional cardiology. We developed a porcine model to examine the feasibility and efficacy of transcoronary pacing during PCI. Eight pigs under general anesthesia underwent unipolar transcoronary pacing with a standard floppy guidewire in a coronary artery (as the cathode) and a skin patch electrode (as the anode). We examined the effect of skin-patch position (groin vs. anterior or posterior chest wall), the presence of an angioplasty balloon on the guidewire and also which coronary artery was "wired" on the efficacy of pacing as assessed by capture and threshold data. Pacing with the bare guidewire and a maximum output of 10 V was successful in 54% of the animals with a groin patch and the anterior chestwall patch, but in 100% with a posterior chest-wall patch. The pacing thresholds were 8.3 +/- 2.2 V, 7.6 +/- 2.8 V and 3.4 +/- 2.4 V with the patch in these sites, respectively. With an angioplasty balloon over the guidewire, pacing efficacy increased to 100% (irrespective of the target vessel or patch location) and pacing thresholds were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) to 2.7 +/- 1.5 (with a groin patch) and 1.0 +/- 0.7 V (with a posterior chestwall patch). With optimal pacing set-up (posterior chest-wall patch and angioplasty-balloon insulation), pacing thresholds were similar to those obtained with standard bipolar transvenous pacing at 1.2 +/- 0.8 V. We did not observe any adverse effects of coronary pacing. Skeletal muscle contraction was only generated at high-output levels. This pig model examines the practicalities of transcoronary pacing and shows that this technique can produce 100% capture at thresholds comparable to the transvenous approach. This technique may have a role during PCI, particularly in an emergency situation.


A mechanomyographic frequency-based fatigue threshold test.

Base pair stacking in nucleosome DNA and bendability sequence pattern. DNA deformation in the nucleosome involves partial unstacking between bases and base pairs. By adjusting orientations of different base-pair stacks relative to the histone octamer surface, the optimal set of stacks and their positions is derived, resulting in a sequence pattern, theoretically best suitable for nucleosome DNA. The sequence is very much consistent with available experimental data, thus, suggesting a common eukaryotic nucleosome DNA bendability sequence pattern based exclusively on the very basics of DNA.

Hyperbaric oxygen induces a cytoprotective and angiogenic response in human microvascular endothelial cells. A genome-wide microarray analysis of gene expression was carried out on human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) exposed to hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) under conditions that approximated clinical settings. Highly up-regulated genes included immediate early transcription factors (FOS, FOSB, and JUNB) and metallothioneins. Six molecular chaperones were also up-regulated immediately following HBOT, and all of these have been implicated in protein damage control. Pathway analysis programs identified the Nrf-2-mediated oxidative stress response as one of the primary responders to HBOT. Several of the microarray changes in the Nrf2 pathway and a molecular chaperone were validated using quantitative PCR. For all of the genes tested (Nrf2, HMOX1, HSPA1A, M1A, ACTC1, and FOS), HBOT elicited large responses, whereas changes were minimal following treatment with 100% O(2) in the absence of elevated pressure. The increased expression of immediate early and cytoprotective genes corresponded with an HBOT-induced increase in cell proliferation and oxidative stress resistance. In addition, HBOT treatment enhanced endothelial tube formation on Matrigel plates, with particularly dramatic effects observed following two daily HBO treatments. Understanding how HBOT influences gene expression changes in endothelial cells may be beneficial for improving current HBOT-based wound-healing protocols. These data also point to other potential HBOT applications where stimulating protection and repair of the endothelium would be beneficial, such as patient preconditioning prior to major surgery.

Genomic study of replication initiation in human chromosomes reveals the influence of transcription regulation and chromatin structure on origin selection. DNA replication in metazoans initiates from multiple chromosomal loci called origins. Currently, there are two methods to purify origin-centered nascent strands: lambda exonuclease digestion and anti-bromodeoxyuridine immunoprecipitation. Because both methods have unique strengths and limitations, we purified nascent strands by both methods, hybridized them independently to tiling arrays (1% genome) and compared the data to have an accurate view of genome-wide origin distribution. By this criterion, we identified 150 new origins that were reproducible across the methods. Examination of a subset of these origins by chromatin immunoprecipitation against origin recognition complex (ORC) subunits 2 and 3 showed 93% of initiation peaks to localize at/within 1 kb of ORC binding sites. Correlation of origins with functional elements of the genome revealed origin activity to be significantly enriched around transcription start sites (TSSs). Consistent with proximity to TSSs, we found a third of initiation events to occur at or near the RNA polymerase II binding sites. Interestingly, approximately 50% of the early origin activity was localized within 5 kb of transcription regulatory factor binding region clusters. The chromatin signatures around the origins were enriched in H3K4-(di- and tri)-methylation and H3 acetylation modifications on histones. Affinity of origins for open chromatin was also reiterated by their proximity to DNAse I-hypersensitive sites. Replication initiation peaks were AT rich, and >50% of the origins mapped to evolutionarily conserved regions of the genome. In summary, these findings indicate that replication initiation is influenced by transcription initiation and regulation as well as chromatin structure.

Mechanisms of dealing with DNA damage in terminally differentiated cells. To protect genomic integrity living cells that are continuously exposed to DNA-damaging insults are equipped with an efficient defence mechanism termed the DNA damage response. Its function is to eliminate DNA damage through DNA repair and to remove damaged cells by apoptosis. The DNA damage response has been investigated mainly in proliferating cells, in which the cell cycle machinery is integrated with the DNA damage signalling. The current knowledge of the mechanisms of DNA repair, DNA damage signalling and cell death of post-mitotic cells that have undergone irreversible cell cycle withdrawal will be reviewed. Evidence will be provided that the protection of the genome integrity in terminally differentiated cells is achieved by different strategies than in proliferating cells.

Prevalence and correlates of HIV and syphilis infections among men who have sex with men in Chongqing Municipality, China. To examine the prevalence and correlates of HIV/syphilis infections and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Chongqing, China. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted to provide information, including sociodemographics, sexual and drug use behaviors, HIV knowledge, and HIV-related services in 2006 and 2007, respectively. Multiple methods, including venue-based recruitment, community outreach, Internet advertisements, and peer referral, were used to identify men in Chongqing willing to participate in this study. Of the 1692 participants, 10.8% were HIV-infected (range by district: 7.0%-15.0%), 8.6% were syphilis-infected, and 15.3% self-reported STD-related symptoms. HIV infection was associated with older age, recruitment from bathhouses/saunas, less education, more male sex partners, sex with a woman in the past 6 months, syphilis infection, and STD-related symptoms. Syphilis infection was associated with older age, less education, inconsistent condom use with a man, STD-related symptoms, and HIV infection. STD-related symptoms were associated with older age, being of nonlocal residency, inconsistent condom use with a humans, having ever paid for sex with a humans, HIV infection, and being from District 1. HIV and syphilis infections have reached alarmingly high rates in Chongqing's MSM population. Better targeted, in-depth and comprehensive intervention strategies are needed urgently, including education, condom promotion and distribution, STD control, drug use-related intervention, and advocacy for HIV counseling and testing with bridges to HIV prevention and care services. Widespread testing for HIV, syphilis, and other major STDs in this risk group should be considered as measures for control.

Evaluation of percutaneous endoscopic feeding tube placement in obese patients. Percutaneous endoscopic feeding tube placement is generally safe and effective for establishing enteral access. In certain subpopulations, such as obese patients, substantial data are limited. This study evaluates the success rate and potential for late complications with placement of feeding tubes in obese patients. The Medical University of South Carolina endoscopy database was queried for adult patients with a body mass index >or=30 kg/m(2) who had undergone percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy, and direct percutaneous jejunostomy placement procedures between the years 2000 and 2006. Sixty-seven subjects met the inclusion criteria. Percutaneous endoscopic feeding tube placement was successful in 60 of 67 individuals (89.6%) with an average procedure time of 15.5 minutes (range, 5-70 minutes). Postplacement complications occurred in 26 of 59 subjects (44.1%) and included peristomal pain (8.5%), cellulitis (8.5%), inadvertent removal (6.8%), peritubular leak (6.8%), nausea (3.4%), and hemoperitoneum (3.4%). In multivariable logistic regression analysis, weight >250 pounds (>113 kg) predicted a significantly increased likelihood of complications (adjusted odds ratio = 3.86; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-14.57). Other covariates did not significantly affect the complication rate. Percutaneous enteral access device placement in obese patients is generally safe, and a body mass index >or=30 kg/m(2) alone should not be a procedural contraindication. Adherence to safe enteral access placement techniques and close periprocedure follow-up should occur in obese patients, especially those weighing >250 pounds (>113 kg). More research is needed to fully evaluate the efficacy of enteral access in this population.

Vitamin D deficiency in adult fracture patients: prevalence and risk factors. Although vitamin D levels are not routinely monitored in outpatient fracture patients, identification of fracture patients with a deficient vitamin D status may be clinically relevant because of the potential role of vitamin D in fracture healing. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of and risk factors for vitamin D deficiency in non-operatively treated adult fracture patients. Vitamin D levels were determined in a cross-sectional study of adult patients, who were treated non-operatively for a fracture of the upper or lower extremity in the outpatient clinic of a level 1 trauma center, during one calendar year. Potential risk factors for (severe) vitamin D deficiency were analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis. A total of 208 men and 319 women with a mean age of 49.7Â years (SDÂ 19.9) were included. In this population, 71Â % had a serum calcidiol <75Â nmol/L, 40Â % were vitamin D deficient (serum calcidiol <50Â nmol/L) and 11Â % were severely vitamin D deficient (serum calcidiol <25Â nmol/L). Smoking and season (winter and spring) were independent risk factors for vitamin D deficiency. An increasing age, a non-Caucasian skin type, winter and smoking were identified as independent risk factors for severe vitamin D deficiency. The use of vitamin D, alcohol consumption and higher average daily sun exposure were independent protective factors against (severe) vitamin D deficiency. Given the potential role of vitamin D in fracture healing, clinicians treating adult fracture patients should be aware of the frequent presence of vitamin D deficiency during the winter, especially in smoking and non-Caucasian patients. Research on the effect of vitamin D deficiency or supplementation on fracture healing is needed, before suggesting routine monitoring or supplementation.

Pathogenesis and diagnostic criteria for rickets and osteomalacia--proposal by an expert panel supported by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan, the Japanese Society for Bone and Mineral Research, and the Japan Endocrine Society. Rickets and osteomalacia are diseases characterized by impaired mineralization of bone matrix. Recent investigations have revealed that the causes of rickets and osteomalacia are quite variable. Although these diseases can severely impair the quality of life of affected patients, rickets and osteomalacia can be completely cured or at least respond to treatment when properly diagnosed and treated according to the specific causes. On the other hand, there are no standard criteria to diagnose rickets or osteomalacia nationally and internationally. Therefore, we summarize the definition and pathogenesis of rickets and osteomalacia, and propose diagnostic criteria and a flowchart for the differential diagnosis of various causes of these diseases. We hope that these criteria and the flowchart are clinically useful for the proper diagnosis and management of these diseases. 

Association of renal artery stenosis with aortic jet velocity in hypertensive patients with aortic valve sclerosis. Patients with aortic valve sclerosis (AVS) have an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (RAS) develop resistant hypertension and heart failure. We hypothesized AVS may be copresent with RAS in hypertensive patients. Hypertensive patients with AVS (n = 167) underwent magnetic resonance (MR) angiography using nonenhanced steady-state free precession (SSFP) technique. More than 75% luminal narrowing in the proximal region of main renal artery was regarded as significant RAS. Peak aortic jet velocity was obtained by Doppler echocardiography. We measured brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. Unilateral or bilateral RAS was detected in 40 patients. AVS patients with RAS were older (78 +/- 6 vs. 74 +/- 8 years), and had higher levels of aortic jet velocity (162 +/- 4 vs. 144 +/- 3 cm/s), and lower levels of GFR (55 +/- 13 vs. 62 +/- 14 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) than those without RAS. Higher aortic jet velocity (odds ratio (OR) = 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.09-2.31) and lower GFR (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.33-0.38) were associated with the presence of RAS, after being adjusted for age, systolic blood pressure, and BNP. RAS was detected in hypertensive patients with AVS, particularly in patients with higher aortic jet velocity and lower GFR. Higher aortic jet velocity and lower GRF may be useful as a potential indicator for those needing assessment of RAS for risk stratification and deserves further study.

Investigation of relationships between barley stress peptides and beer gushing using SDS-PAGE and MS screening. The relationship between gushing and antifungal peptides in barley and malt kernels was examined for five barley varieties produced in the Czech Republic with four conditions of infection and treatment. Proteome changes during pathogen-seed interaction were observed with SDS-PAGE and MALDI-TOF MS. These methods were applied as a fast screening for observing the relationship between gushing and peptides/proteins. It was found that the presence of basic peptides, presumably hordothionins and non-specific lipid transfer protein type 1, did not correlate with the degree of gushing for malt (/r/ in <0.07, 0.34>), (/r/ in <0.01, 0.49>), respectively, as detected by both methods.

Sensor evaluation for tracking upper extremity prosthesis movements in a virtual environment. The use of virtual reality technology in the field of amputee rehabilitation is in its earliest stages of development. A virtual environment (VE) will facilitate the early rehabilitation of a patient before they are clinically ready to be fitted with an actual prosthesis. Success will be defined by delivering accurate position and orientation data of the arm to the virtual environment. We have applied an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a linear displacement sensor to a prosthetic arm to track its movement in a virtual environment. Preliminary results show that even with advances in MEMS (microelectromechanical systems) sensor technology integration error is likely too significant to make an IMU an acceptable choice for position measurement.

Protein microarray with horseradish peroxidase chemiluminescence for quantification of serum Î±-fetoprotein. To develop and evaluate a protein microarray assay with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) chemiluminescence for quantification of Î±-fetoprotein (AFP) in serum from patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A protein microarray assay for AFP was developed. Serum was collected from patients with HCC and healthy control subjects. AFP was quantified using protein microarray and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Serum AFP concentrations determined via protein microarray were positively correlated (râ=â0.973) with those determined via ELISA in patients with HCC (nâ=â60) and healthy control subjects (nâ=â30). Protein microarray showed 80% sensitivity and 100% specificity for HCC diagnosis. ELISA had 83.3% sensitivity and 100% specificity. Protein microarray effectively distinguished between patients with HCC and healthy control subjects (area under ROC curve 0.974; 95% CI 0.000, 1.000). Protein microarray is a rapid, simple and low-cost alternative to ELISA for detecting AFP in human serum.

Allergic contact dermatitis from ethyl chloride and benzocaine. Ethyl chloride (EC) or chloroethane (C2H5Cl) is a volatile halogenated hydrocarbon. Reports of contact sensitivity to this gas are infrequent considering its widespread use as a local anesthetic, and it may have a relatively low sensitization potential. Benzocaine is another local anesthetic derivative of the ethyl ester of para-aminobenzoic acid, previously reported as a causative agent of delayed hypersensitivity reactions. We present a patient who developed a generalized itching dermatitis after the application of a medical aerosol containing EC, as well as facial angioedema and tongue swelling after the local application of benzocaine. Patch-test results were positive for EC "as is" (++), benzocaine 5% in petrolatum (++), and caine mix (+++) at 96 hours (day 4). The possibility of cross-sensitization between both drugs would not have been chemically plausible. We report the first published clinical case of contact allergic dermatitis from two chemically unrelated local anesthetics (EC and benzocaine) in the same patient.

Laboratory Evaluation of the gForce Trackerâ¢, a Head Impact Kinematic Measuring Device for Use in Football Helmets. This study sought to compare a new head impact-monitoring device, which is not limited to specific helmet styles, against reference accelerometer measurements. Laboratory controlled impacts were delivered using a linear pneumatic impactor to a Hybrid III headform (HIII) fitted with a football helmet and the impact monitoring device (gForce Tracker-GFT) affixed to the inside of the helmet. Linear regression analyses and absolute mean percent error (MAPE) were used to compare the head impact kinematics measured by the GFT to a reference accelerometer located at the HIII's center of mass. The coefficients of determination were strong for the peak linear acceleration, peak rotational velocity, and HIC15 across all impact testing locations (r(2) = 0.82, 0.94, and 0.70, respectively), but there were large MAPE for the peak linear acceleration and HIC15 (MAPE = 49 Â± 21% and 108 Â± 58%). The raw GFT was accurate at measuring the peak rotational velocity at the center of mass of the HIII (MAPE = 9%). Results from the impact testing were used to develop a correction algorithm. The coefficients of determination for all impact parameters improved using the correction algorithm for the GFT (r(2) > 0.97), and the MAPE were less than 14%. The GFT appears to be a suitable impact-monitoring device that is not limited to specific styles of football helmets, however, correction algorithms will need to be developed for each helmet style.


Von Willebrand disease in women: awareness and diagnosis.

Self-reported memory problems in multiple sclerosis: influence of psychiatric status and normative dissociative experiences. Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients' self-reported cognitive difficulties do not typically correlate well with objective neuropsychological assessment. The relationship between self-reported memory, dissociation, emotional problems, and objective cognitive functioning was examined in 79 MS patients. Increased self-reported memory problems were significantly associated with higher levels of normative dissociation. Self-reported memory problems were also associated with more reports of depression, anxiety, and neuroticism. Consistent with expectations, self-reported memory was not significantly associated with performance on any of the neuropsychological variables. The present study then evaluated a theoretical causal model with normative dissociation mediating the relationship between emotional problems and perceived cognitive problems. Increased depression, anxiety, and neuroticism were all significantly correlated with more dissociative cognitive failures, which, in turn, were strongly associated with perceived memory problems. Findings have significant theoretical implications for understanding the relationship between perceived and objective cognitive difficulties. Findings are also clinically relevant and suggest that dissociative experiences should be evaluated when MS patients report memory problems.

Distribution Analyzer, a methodology for identifying and clustering outlier conditions from single-cell distributions, and its application to a Nanog reporter RNAi screen.

Employer perceptions of knowledge, competency, and professionalism of baccalaureate nursing graduates from a problem-based program. Employer evaluation of graduates is a critical component of professional program evaluation and contributes a viewpoint rarely reported in the literature. It has been proposed that Problem-Based Learning (PBL) enhances knowledge acquisition, clinical competency and professional behavior. Students assume the role of a registered nurse as they work through real practice scenarios on a daily basis in the classroom. The purpose of this study was to explore employer perceptions of graduates' knowledge, competency and professionalism, following completion of a PBL program. Nurse employers (N=53) participated in 10 focus group discussions. Four main themes were derived from employer descriptions of their experience with PBL graduates: still rough around the edges, we want them to succeed, a new generation of practitioner, and potential to lead the profession into the future. Please add what the implications of these findings are to nursing education.

Oppositional defiant behavior toward adults and oppositional defiant behavior toward other children: evidence for two separate constructs with mothers' and fathers' ratings of Brazilian children. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to determine if oppositional defiant behavior (ODB) toward adults and oppositional defiant behavior toward other children were constructs distinct from each other as well as from attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-hyperactivity/impulsivity (ADHD-HI), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder-inattention (ADHD-IN), and academic competence. Mothers and fathers rated the occurrence of the DSM-IV oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms where the target was an adult (e.g., argues with adults) and the ODD symptoms where the target was another child (brothers, sisters, or peers) (e.g., argues with other children) along with ADHD-IN, ADHD-HI, and academic competence in a sample of 894 Brazilian children on the Portuguese version of the Child and Adolescent Disruptive Behavior Inventory (CADBI). The ODB-Adults' and ODB-Children's factors showed invariance (i.e., equality of like item loadings, intercepts, residuals; as well as like factor variances, covariances, and means), convergent validity, and discriminant validity from each other as well as from ADHD-IN, ADHD-HI, and academic competence between mothers' and fathers' ratings. With the Portuguese parent version of the CADBI, the evidence indicated that ODB-Adults and ODB-Children represent two constructs rather than one. The distinction between ODB-Adults and ODB-Children allows for a more specific study of the development of ODB in children.


Fission yeast Pcp1 links polo kinase-mediated mitotic entry to gamma-tubulin-dependent spindle formation.

Neurotrophic regulation of fibroblast dedifferentiation during limb skeletal regeneration in the axolotl (Ambystoma mexicanum). The ability of animals to repair tissue damage is widespread and impressive. Among tissues, the repair and remodeling of bone occurs during growth and in response to injury; however, loss of bone above a threshold amount is not regenerated, resulting in a "critical-size defect" (CSD). The development of therapies to replace or regenerate a CSD is a major focus of research in regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. Adult urodeles (salamanders) are unique in their ability to regenerate complex tissues perfectly, yet like mammals do not regenerate a CSD. We report on an experimental model for the regeneration of a CSD in the axolotl (the Excisional Regeneration Model) that allows for the identification of signals to induce fibroblast dedifferentiation and skeletal regeneration. This regenerative response is mediated in part by BMP signaling, as is the case in mammals; however, a complete regenerative response requires the induction of a population of undifferentiated, regeneration-competent cells. These cells can be induced by signaling from limb amputation to generate blastema cells that can be grafted to the wound, as well as by signaling from a nerve and a wound epithelium to induce blastema cells from fibroblasts within the wound environment.

Gangrene intestine caused by Ascaris lumbricoides; report of 5 cases in children. Ascaris infestation in the gastrointestinal tract is well known in Asian countries. It can be asymptomatic or can present with symptoms of acute abdomen. Perforation and torsion with gangrene are its very rare fatal complications but an important cause of mortality in children. Although ascariasis is very rare in developed countries, clinicians should consider this potentially dangerous, yet treatable, infection in the differential diagnosis of acute abdomen. We herein report a series of five cases of intestinal gangrene secondary to extensive infestation by Ascaris lumbricoides in children aged 1-4 years.

Metabolite profiling of CHO cells: Molecular reflections of bioprocessing effectiveness. Whilst development of medium and feeds has provided major advances in recombinant protein production in CHO cells, the fundamental understanding is limited. We have applied metabolite profiling with established robust (GC-MS) analytics to define the molecular loci by which two yield-enhancing feeds improve recombinant antibody yields from a model GS-CHO cell line. With data across core metabolic pathways, that report on metabolism within several cellular compartments, these data identify key metabolites and events associated with increased cell survival and specific productivity of cells. Of particular importance, increased process efficiency was linked to the functional activity of the mitochondria, with the amount and time course of use/production of intermediates of the citric acid cycle, for uses such as lipid biosynthesis, precursor generation and energy production, providing direct indicators of cellular status with respect to productivity. The data provide clear association between specific cellular metabolic indicators and cell process efficiency, extending from prior indications of the relevance of lactate metabolic balance to other redox sinks (glycerol, sorbitol and threitol). The information, and its interpretation, identifies targets for engineering cell culture efficiency, either from genetic or environmental perspectives, and greater understanding of the significance of specific medium components towards overall CHO cell bioprocessing. 

Determination of the diversity of Rhodopirellula isolates from European seas by multilocus sequence analysis. In the biogeography of microorganisms, the habitat size of an attached-living bacterium has never been investigated. We approached this theme with a multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) study of new strains of Rhodopirellula sp., an attached-living planctomycete. The development of an MLSA for Rhodopirellula baltica enabled the characterization of the genetic diversity at the species level, beyond the resolution of the 16S rRNA gene. The alleles of the nine housekeeping genes acsA, guaA, trpE, purH, glpF, fumC, icd, glyA, and mdh indicated the presence of 13 genetically defined operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in our culture collection. The MLSA-based OTUs coincided with the taxonomic units defined by DNA-DNA hybridization experiments. BOX-PCR supported the MLSA-based differentiation of two closely related OTUs. This study established a taxon-area relationship of cultivable Rhodopirellula species. In European seas, three closely related species covered the Baltic Sea and the eastern North Sea, the North Atlantic region, and the southern North Sea to the Mediterranean. The last had regional genotypes, as revealed by BOX-PCR. This suggests a limited habitat size of attached-living Rhodopirellula species.


AtnMat2, a nuclear-encoded maturase required for splicing of group-II introns in Arabidopsis mitochondria.

Ionic ingress and charge-neutralization phenomena of conducting-polymer films. Ionic ingress and diffusion through a conducting-polymer (CP) film containing embedded charges under potential and concentration gradients is studied. Electroneutrality, a common assumption in modeling of similar systems, is not justified in this case or similar diffusion-limited processes, as the timescale of ionic diffusion in the solid matrix is quite large. Counter ions therefore cannot move instantaneously for effective neutralization of excess charges. Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations have to be solved for such cases without any simplifying assumption. Analytical solution shows the existence of a charge boundary layer, which limits and strongly influences the ionic flux. A general numerical method for solution is also developed for the dynamic modeling, analysis, and design of these types of systems. The numerical results are validated by comparison with analytical solutions as well as with some experimental results available in the literature. With this modeling framework, the basic features of controlled release of molecules across a CP film under an applied electrical potential can be explained quantitatively.


Combinatorial regulation: characteristics of dynamic correlations.

The iron chelator deferasirox enhances liposomal amphotericin B efficacy in treating murine invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Increased bone marrow iron levels in patients with haematological malignancies is an independent risk factor for developing invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA), suggesting an important role for iron uptake in the pathogenesis of IPA. We sought to determine the potential for combination therapy with the iron chelator deferasirox + liposomal amphotericin B (LAmB) to improve the outcome of murine IPA compared with LAmB monotherapy. In vitro MIC and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) values of the iron chelator, deferasirox, for Aspergillus fumigatus were determined by microdilution assay. In addition, we studied the efficacy of deferasirox alone or combined with LAmB in treating immunocompromised mice infected with A. fumigatus via inhalation. Deferasirox was cidal in vitro against A. fumigatus, with an MIC and MFC of 25 and 50 mg/L, respectively. Deferasirox monotherapy modestly prolonged survival of mice with IPA. Combination deferasirox + LAmB therapy synergistically improved survival and reduced lung fungal burden compared with either monotherapy alone. Iron chelation therapy with deferasirox alone or in combination with LAmB is effective in treating experimental IPA. Further study of deferasirox is warranted as adjunctive therapy for IPA infections.

Molecular dynamics studies of aqueous silica nanoparticle dispersions: salt effects on the double layer formation. The ion distribution around hydroxylated silica nanoparticles (NP-H) dispersed in brine was investigated by fully atomistic molecular dynamics. The NP-H dispersions in aqueous electrolyte media are simulated in solutions of varying salinity (NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2), salt concentration (0.06ââÃââ10(-3) to 3.00ââÃââ10(-3) mole fraction [Formula: see text]), and temperature (300 and 350âK) at 1âatm. The NP-H models reproduce the observed experimental concentration of silanol and geminal surface sites, which are responsible for local charge variations on the nanoparticles' surface. Interestingly, under certain salt concentration conditions, the formation of an electrical double layer (DL) around the overall neutral NP-H occurs. The resulting DLs are attenuated with increasing temperature for all evaluated salts. With increasing salt concentration, a sign inversion of the effective charge at the first ion layer is observed, which modifies the electrostatic environment around the nanoparticle. The minimum salt concentration that leads to a DL formation at 300âK is 1.05ââÃââ10(-3), 0.37ââÃââ10(-3), and 0.06ââÃââ10(-3) Ïs for NaCl, CaCl2, and MgCl2, respectively. The width of the DL decreases sequentially in ionic strength from NaCl to CaCl2 to MgCl2, which is similar to that found for highly charged surfaces. These results are in line with our previous experimental data for negative charged NP-H. All together, these observations suggest an interplay mechanism between the formation and narrowing of electric double layers on the stability of NP dispersions in both neutral and negatively charged NP-H.

Implication of unfolded protein response in resveratrol-induced inhibition of K562 cell proliferation. Resveratrol (RES), a natural plant polyphenol, is an effective inducer of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in a variety of carcinoma cell types. In addition, RES has been reported to inhibit tumorigenesis in several animal models suggesting that it functions as a chemopreventive and anti-tumor agent in vivo. The chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties associated with resveratrol offer promise for the design of new chemotherapeutic agents. However, the mechanisms by which RES mediates its effects are not yet fully understood. In this study, we showed that RES caused cell cycle arrest and proliferation inhibition via induction of unfolded protein response (UPR) in human leukemia K562 cell line. Treatment of K562 cells with RES induced a number of signature UPR markers, including transcriptional induction of GRP78 and CHOP, phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha), ER stress-specific XBP-1 splicing, suggesting the induction of UPR by RES. RES inhibited proliferation of K562 in a concentration-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analyses revealed that K562 cells were arrested in G1 phase upon RES treatment. Salubrinal, an eIF2alpha inhibitor, or overexpression of dominant negative mutants of PERK or eIF2alpha, effectively restored RES-induced cell cycle arrest, underscoring the important role of PERK/eIF2alpha branch of UPR in RES-induced inhibition of cell proliferation.


End-stage renal disease in young black males in a black-white population: longitudinal analysis of the Bogalusa Heart Study.

Pharmacokinetics and clinical toxicity of prilocaine and ropivacaine following combined drug administration in brachial plexus anesthesia. Local anesthetics (LA) are often administered in combination for regional anesthesia in order to obtain the specific advantages (onset and duration of effect) of each drug. However, few data on the safety of such combinations are available and consequently plasma concentrations possibly associated with toxicity and interactions between the specific anesthetics are not sufficiently established. We measured pharmacokinetics and toxicity parameters of prilocaine and ropivacaine after combined use as single doses in brachial plexus blockade. In an open clinical study using a combined dose regime (300 mg prilocaine followed immediately by 75 mg ropivacaine) total plasma concentrations of prilocaine and ropivacaine were measured serially in 60 patients using a gas-chromatographic method. The data were analyzed regarding a relationship with central nervous and cardiovascular toxicity. Following the administration in combination prilocaine and ropivacaine were rapidly absorbed. Mean prilocaine peak plasma concentrations (mean Cmax = 1.51 microg/ml) were measured between 15 and 30 min after injection. Highest ropivacaine plasma concentrations (mean Cmax = 1.12 microg/ml) were seen between 30 min and 1 hour after injection (calculated mean tmax = 44 min). One of 59 patients showed signs of myoclonus which were suspected of being due to intravascular injection. There was no relevant cardiovascular toxicity observed in terms of changes in the QRS complex, PQ interval prolongation, AV dissociation, occurrence of extrasystoles or sinus arrest. The pharmacokinetics of combined administration did not differ from those of prilocaine and ropivacaine given alone. The use of a combined prilocaine/ ropivacaine (300 mg/75 mg) dose regimen in patients given single dose for brachial plexus blockade can generally be regarded as safe with regard to peak plasma concentrations and cardiovascular toxicity and this holds true for patients with a higher perioperative risk profile (ASA III grading, American Society of Anesthesiologists). The considerable inter-individual variation in LA peak plasma concentrations observed in our patients and the one case of suspected accidental intravascular injection, highlight the necessity of adequate monitoring of the patients undergoing LA injections.

Safety of downstream high-dose tirofiban bolus among 1578 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention: the Sant'ANna TIrofiban Safety study. The Sant'ANna TIrofiban Safety study (SANTISS) is an open-label investigator-initiated single-centre registry launched to assess the combination of bleeding and access site in-hospital complications (primary end-point) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) by femoral approach only. We compared patients who were on oral single antiaggregating drug (AAD) and received, just prior to PCI, high-dose tirofiban and a second oral antiplatelet agent (triple AAD: group 1, n = 970) with those who were already on an oral double AAD regimen and did not receive tirofiban (double AAD: group 2, n = 608). Group 2 patients were slightly older, presented less frequently with unstable angina and had chronic renal failure more frequently. They were more than twice as frequently on rescue PCI, being more than three-fold less frequently on primary PCI (all: 0.01>P < 0.001). Overall, there were 87 in-hospital (average 4.7 days of stay) complications: 51 (5.3%) in group 1 and 36 (5.9%) in group 2 (not significant). Haemotransfusions were needed in 34 patients: 21 (2.2%) in group 1 and 13 (2.1%) in group 2 (not significant). Of the 16 hospital deaths, eight (0.8%) were seen in group 1 and eight (1.3%) in group 2 (not significant). Multivariate prediction showed a high predictive accuracy (areas under the curve >0.700) of female sex, rescue PCI and chronic renal failure to index complications, with highly significant odds ratios. The presence of high-dose tirofiban did not increase complication risk. In the real world, high-dose tirofiban is well tolerated by patients on elective, primary or rescue PCI, and the in-hospital complication rate, including major bleeding, is low. This may have pharmacoeconomic consequences.

RP-HPLC-DAD-MS(n) Analysis and Butyrylcholinesterase Inhibitory Activity of Barbacenia blanchetii Extracts. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to a diode-array detector (DAD) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (MS) was applied for the separation and identification of phenolic compounds in the n-hexane, ethyl acetate and methanol crude extract of Barbacenia blanchetii. The MS, MSn and UV data together with chemosystematic evidence allowed the structural characterization of five compounds: tricin, chrysoeriol, epi-gallocatechin, kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and caffeoylquinic acid. At the same time, these extracts were evaluated against butyrylcholinesterase using Ellman's method. All extracts inhibited BuChE in a concentration-dependent form; however, the methanol extract showed a better effect that the other extracts. These compounds have been identified previously in the Velloziaceae family, but for the first time as constituents of B. blanchetii.

Circulating microparticles and procoagulant activity in elderly patients. Microparticles (MP) are shed membrane vesicles released from activation or apoptosis of several cell types and carry a procoagulant activity. Age is associated with a procoagulant state, but the role of MP in this setting is unknown, as the relationship of MP to aging in humans. We tested the hypotheses that elderly persons compared with young persons may have different patterns of expression of MP and procoagulant activity in stable or septic conditions. Patients from Emergency and Geriatric Departments were divided into four groups according to their age (< 50 or > or = 75 years old) and the presence of systemic infection (yes or no). The diagnosis of infection was reached when it was classified as certain or possible by an expert panel. Circulating MP were isolated from venous citrated blood. Cytofluorometry using specific antibodies was performed to determine the origins of MP (endothelial microparticles [EMP], red blood cell microparticles, or platelet microparticles). Procoagulant activity was determined using annexin V (prothrombinase activity) and tissue factor (TF) assays. One hundred and eleven patients were included. Elderly patients expressed a decrease in EMP in stable conditions, associated with a decrease in procoagulant annexin V MP in septic conditions (p < .05), and higher EMP levels were found in elderly infected patients who died during hospital stay than in survivors (p = .04). Compared with young patients, response to sepsis was altered in elders concerning EMP, annexin V MP, and TF-bearing MP. Elderly patients expressed a different pattern of MP in stable conditions, with a different response to sepsis in procoagulant activity modification.

Regulatory role of the extreme C-terminal end of the S6 inner helix in C-terminal-truncated Kv1.2 channel activation.

An electrostatic switch displaces phosphatidylinositol phosphate kinases from the membrane during phagocytosis. Plasmalemmal phosphatidylinositol (PI) 4,5-bisphosphate (PI4,5P(2)) synthesized by PI 4-phosphate (PI4P) 5-kinase (PIP5K) is key to the polymerization of actin that drives chemotaxis and phagocytosis. We investigated the means whereby PIP5K is targeted to the membrane and its fate during phagosome formation. Homology modeling revealed that all PIP5K isoforms feature a positively charged face. Together with the substrate-binding loop, this polycationic surface is proposed to constitute a coincidence detector that targets PIP5Ks to the plasmalemma. Accordingly, manipulation of the surface charge displaced PIP5Ks from the plasma membrane. During particle engulfment, PIP5Ks detached from forming phagosomes as the surface charge at these sites decreased. Precluding the change in surface charge caused the PIP5Ks to remain associated with the phagosomal cup. Chemically induced retention of PIP5K-gamma prevented the disappearance of PI4,5P(2) and aborted phagosome formation. We conclude that a bistable electrostatic switch mechanism regulates the association/dissociation of PIP5Ks from the membrane during phagocytosis and likely other processes.


Polychlorinated biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans in marine and lacustrine sediments from the Shandong Peninsula, China.

Conspiracy beliefs about HIV are related to antiretroviral treatment nonadherence among african american men with HIV. Medical mistrust is prevalent among African Americans and may influence health care behaviors such as treatment adherence. We examined whether a specific form of medical mistrust-HIV conspiracy beliefs (eg, HIV is genocide against African Americans)-was associated with antiretroviral treatment nonadherence among African American men with HIV. On baseline surveys, 214 African American men with HIV reported their agreement with 9 conspiracy beliefs, sociodemographic characteristics, depression symptoms, substance use, disease characteristics, medical mistrust, and health care barriers. Antiretroviral medication adherence was monitored electronically for one month postbaseline among 177 men in the baseline sample. Confirmatory factor analysis revealed 2 distinct conspiracy belief subscales: genocidal beliefs (eg, HIV is manmade) and treatment-related beliefs (eg, people who take antiretroviral treatments are human guinea pigs for the government). Both subscales were related to nonadherence in bivariate tests. In a multivariate logistic regression, only treatment-related conspiracies were associated with a lower likelihood of optimal adherence at one-month follow-up (odds ratio = 0.60, 95% confidence interval = 0.37 to 0.96, P < 0.05). HIV conspiracy beliefs, especially those related to treatment mistrust, can contribute to health disparities by discouraging appropriate treatment behavior. Adherence-promoting interventions targeting African Americans should openly address such beliefs.

Intergenic transcription by RNA polymerase II coordinates Pol IV and Pol V in siRNA-directed transcriptional gene silencing in Arabidopsis. Intergenic transcription by RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) is widespread in plant and animal genomes, but the functions of intergenic transcription or the resulting noncoding transcripts are poorly understood. Here, we show that Arabidopsis Pol II is indispensable for endogenous siRNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) at intergenic low-copy-number loci, despite the presence of two other polymerases-Pol IV and Pol V-that specialize in TGS through siRNAs. We show that Pol II produces noncoding scaffold transcripts that originate outside of heterochromatic, siRNA-generating loci. Through these transcripts and physical interactions with the siRNA effector protein ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4), Pol II recruits AGO4/siRNAs to homologous loci to result in TGS. Meanwhile, Pol II transcription also recruits Pol IV and Pol V to different locations at heterochromatic loci to promote siRNA biogenesis and siRNA-mediated TGS, respectively. This study establishes that intergenic transcription by Pol II is required for siRNA-mediated TGS, and reveals an intricate collaboration and division of labor among the three polymerases in gene silencing.

A minor catalytic activity of Src family kinases is sufficient for maximal activation of mast cells via the high-affinity IgE receptor. Src family kinases (SFK) are critical for initiating and regulating the response of mast cells activated by engagement of the high-affinity IgE receptor, FcepsilonRI. Lyn is the predominant SFK in mast cells and has been ascribed both positive and negative roles in regulating mast cell activation. We analyzed the mast cell phenotype of WeeB, a recently described mouse mutant that expresses a Lyn protein with profoundly reduced catalytic activity. Surprisingly, we found that this residual activity is sufficient for wild-type levels of cytokine production and degranulation in bone marrow-derived mast cells after low-intensity stimulation with anti-IgE. High-intensity stimulation of lyn(-/-) bone marrow-derived mast cells with highly multivalent Ag resulted in enhanced cytokine production as previously reported, and WeeB cells displayed an intermediate phenotype. Under this latter condition, SFK inhibition using PP2 increased cytokine production in wild-type and WeeB but not lyn(-/-) cells, resulting in substantially higher levels in the PP2-treated WeeB than in lyn(-/-) cells. Restoration of wild-type and WeeB lyn alleles in lyn(-/-) cells generated activation phenotypes similar to those in nontransduced wild-type and WeeB cells, respectively, whereas a kinase-dead allele resulted in a phenotype similar to that of empty-vector-transduced cells. These data indicate that inhibition of Lyn and/or SFK activity can result in higher levels of mast cell activation than simple deletion of lyn and that only near-complete inhibition of Lyn can impair its positive regulatory functions. Furthermore, the data suggest that both positive and negative regulatory functions of Lyn are predominantly carried out by its catalytic activity and not an adaptor function.

Natural course and treatment efficacy: one-year observation in diabetic and idiopathic carpal tunnel syndrome.

Calcineurin B-Like Protein-Interacting Protein Kinase CIPK21 Regulates Osmotic and Salt Stress Responses in Arabidopsis. The role of calcium-mediated signaling has been extensively studied in plant responses to abiotic stress signals. Calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) and CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs) constitute a complex signaling network acting in diverse plant stress responses. Osmotic stress imposed by soil salinity and drought is a major abiotic stress that impedes plant growth and development and involves calcium-signaling processes. In this study, we report the functional analysis of CIPK21, an Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) CBL-interacting protein kinase, ubiquitously expressed in plant tissues and up-regulated under multiple abiotic stress conditions. The growth of a loss-of-function mutant of CIPK21, cipk21, was hypersensitive to high salt and osmotic stress conditions. The calcium sensors CBL2 and CBL3 were found to physically interact with CIPK21 and target this kinase to the tonoplast. Moreover, preferential localization of CIPK21 to the tonoplast was detected under salt stress condition when coexpressed with CBL2 or CBL3. These findings suggest that CIPK21 mediates responses to salt stress condition in Arabidopsis, at least in part, by regulating ion and water homeostasis across the vacuolar membranes. 


Removal of gadolinium by dialysis: review of different strategies and techniques.

A study of interaction of cationic dyes with anionic polyelectrolytes. The interactions of Acridine Orange with Sodium Alginate and Pinacyanol Chloride with Heparin have been investigated by spectrophotometric method. The polymers induce metachromasy in the dye as evidenced from the considerable blue shift in the absorption maxima of the corresponding dyes. The interaction constant and thermodynamic parameters of polymer-dye interactions have been determined. The effect of additives such as alcohols, and urea on the reversal of metachromasy has been studied. The data has been used to determine the stability of the metachromatic complex and the nature of binding. The thermodynamic parameters of interaction revealed that binding between Acridine Orange and Sodium Alginate involved only electrostatic forces while that between Pinacyanol Chloride involved both electrostatic and hydrophobic forces. The reversal studies using surfactants indicated the involvement of both electrostatic and hydrophobic forces in binding. Based on the results it can be concluded that Pinacyanol Chloride is more effective inducing metachromasy than Acridine Orange.


Radiation in the orthopedic operating theatre.

A randomized, controlled trial of oxycodone versus placebo in patients with postherpetic neuralgia and painful diabetic neuropathy treated with pregabalin. The aim of this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of pregabalin in combination with oxycodone or placebo, in patients with either postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) or painful diabetic neuropathy (PDN). After a 7-day washout period, 62 patients were randomized to receive either oxycodone mixture 10 mg/day or placebo mixture for 1 week. Patients were then started on open-label pregabalin (75, 150, 300 and 600 mg/day) according to a forced titration dosing regimen, while continuing the same dosage of oxycodone or placebo for 4 weeks. The primary efficacy measure was a decrease in the pain-intensity score of at least 2cm and a pain score <4cm measured using a 10-cm visual analogue scale (VAS) following pregabalin dosage escalation and treatment for 4 weeks. Secondary efficacy measures included sleep interference and the Neuropathic Pain Scale. There were similar levels of overall efficacy between pregabalin/oxycodone and pregabalin/placebo groups in relieving PHN and PDN related pain. Peripheral neuropathic pain presents commonly in clinical practice, and 2 of its most prevalent types are PHN and PDN. Currently available treatments provide some degree of pain relief in approximately 40-60% of patients, leaving the remainder with unremitting pain. Although this study supports the effectiveness of pregabalin in the treatment of PHN or PDN, it also shows that the addition of a low dose of oxycodone at 10mg/day does not enhance the pain-relieving effects of pregabalin.

Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: overview and implications for policy makers.

Predictors of the residual disease of high-grade lesions and microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix following conization. To determine the predictors of residual disease of high-grade lesion (HGL) and microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix (MICA) in subsequent hysterectomy following conization. The medical records of women who underwent any conizations diagnosed of HGL and MICA and followed by subsequent hysterectomy within 6 months were retrospectively reviewed. A case and control was defined as whether or not a residual disease of HGL or more was detected in cervical tissue from hysterectomy after conization. Demographic characteristics and pathological features of cases and controls were recorded independently and blindly. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used. The Receiver Operating Characteristics curve of predictors was created using the fitting value obtained from a logistic regression model. A total of 185 women were diagnosed during January 1, 1997 and July 31, 2008 including 102 women without a residual disease and 83 with residual disease at cervical tissue from hysterectomy. The multivariate analysis showed that postmenopausal status (OR = 3.5, 95% CI = 1.8-6.7), number of quadrant involvement (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.8-8.3), internal margin involvement (OR = 3.8, 95% CI = 1.7-8.2), severe nuclear atypia (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.1-3.8) and high mitotic activity (OR = 2.1, 95% CI = 1.1-3.7) were the predictors of residual disease in hysterectomy specimens after conization. Three or more predictors involved predicted the detection of residual disease. The presence of postmenopause, three or four quadrants involved, positive internal margin, severe nuclear atypia and high mitotic activity could be used to predict residual lesions after conization.


The effect of combined treatment with morphine sulphate and low-dose ketamine in a prehospital setting.

Physico-chemical studies on adulteration of honey in Nigeria. The extent of adulteration of honey samples from various geographical locations in Nigeria was evaluated. In order to ascertain the quality and extent of adulteration of the honey samples, the total titrable acidity, brix content, pH, colour, viscosity, moisture content, total solids, ash content, hydroxymethyl furfural and microbiological analysis were carried out. Honey samples from Akwa-Ibom, Ondo and Ogun had a high hydroxymethyl furfural with coliforms and total bacteria counts being absent, while honey samples from Shaki, Yola and Ibadan had a low hydroxymethyl furfural and some total viable counts were present in them. These results indicate that honey samples from Akwa-Ibom, Ondo and Ogun were completely free of adulteration. However, honey samples obtained from Shaki, Yola and Ibadan were discovered to have undergone some form of adulteration.

Femtosecond laser-assisted astigmatic keratotomy in naturally occurring high astigmatism. The technique and a case report of femtosecond laser-assisted astigmatic keratotomy (FS AK) are reported in a patient with naturally occurring high astigmatism. The operation was performed using flap mode software to create two anterior arcuate side cuts in each eye using a femtosecond laser (IntraLase/AMO, Irvine, California; 30 kHz) in a 30-year-old female with a naturally occurring high astigmatism (with-the-rule) of 5.25 D in both eyes. In the right eye, the manifest refraction improved from -3.5+5.25 x 89 preoperatively, with an uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) of counting fingers (CF) and a best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) of 20/25, to -1.75+2.75 x 90 postoperatively, with a UCVA of 20/50 and a BSCVA of 20/20. In the left eye, the manifest refraction improved from -3.5+5.25 x 83 preoperatively, with a UCVA of 20/200 and a BSCVA of 20/20, to -1.75+2.25 x 85 postoperatively, with a UCVA of 20/30 and a BSCVA of 20/20.

A multicenter, long-term study on arrhythmias in children with Ebstein anomaly. To assess the prevalence, history, and treatment of arrhythmias, in particular preexcitation and Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, in patients with Ebstein anomaly (EA) during childhood and adolescence, we performed a multicenter retrospective study of all consecutive live-born patients with EA, diagnosed, and followed by pediatric cardiologists between 1980 and 2005 in The Netherlands. During a follow-up after EA diagnosis of 13 years 3 months (range: 6 days to 28 years 2 months), 16 (17%) of the 93 pediatric EA patients exhibited rhythm disturbances. Nine patients showed arrhythmic events starting as of the neonatal period. Supraventricular tachycardia was noted in 11 patients. One patient died in the neonatal period due to intractable supraventricular tachycardia resulting in heart failure and one patient died at 5 weeks of age most probably due to an arrhythmic event. The 14 surviving patients all show preexcitation, albeit 4 of them intermittently, and all have a right-sided accessory pathway location. Nine patients underwent catheter ablation of an accessory pathway. Only four patients are currently on antiarrhythmic drugs. The 17% prevalence of rhythm disturbances in pediatric EA patients, most commonly supraventricular arrhythmias, is significantly lower than in adult EA patients. Life-threatening rhythm disturbances are not frequent early in life. Symptomatic patients are well treated with radiofrequency catheter ablation.


Stress induced gene expression drives transient DNA methylation changes at adjacent repetitive elements.

Low-dose recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor enhances effect of hepatocyte transplantation in rats treated with retrorsine. The aim of this study was to regenerate transplanted hepatocytes selectively in a recipient using retrorsine and recombinant human hepatocyte growth factor (rhHGF). Nagase analbuminemic rats (NARs) received pretreatment with retrosine and were divided into three experimental groups. Group1: Hepatocyte transplantation (HcTx) + 50 microg/kg/day rhHGF. Group2: HcTx + 250 microg/kg/day rhHGF. Group3: HcTx + normal saline. The serum levels of albumin and the albumin-positive hepatocytes in the liver were investigated. The rat endogenous HGF of the rats given only retrorsine was measured. The serum albumin levels of Group11 were higher than those of Group2, while there was no significant difference between Group2 and GroupS. Histological examination of Group1 and 3 showed the presence of a large number of albumin-positive hepatocytes, which frequently consisted of large clusters and occupied 53.90 +/- 2.31% and 31.25 +/- 5.36% of host liver, respectively. The liver sections of Group2 showed numerous albumin-positive hepatocyte, which were not seen as clusters. The rat endogenous HGF concentration was extremely high. Low-dose rhHGF enhances the effect of HcTx under the suppressive state of proliferation of host hepatocytes. Because of the high endogenous HGF, the administration of a high concentration of rhHGF suppressed the regenerative activity of the transplanted hepatocytes.

Pattern of Female Sexual Assault in Qalyubia Governorate, Egypt, During the Period From 2009 to 2013: A Retrospective Study. Sexual assault is a serious social problem that affects women's life. In Egypt, there is no accurate epidemiological study on sexual assault, although it has undergone a dramatic surge in 2013. The goals of this study were to estimate the prevalence and the characteristics of sexual assault against female in Qalyubia Governorate, Egypt. It is a retrospective study evaluating sexual assault against females from 2009 to 2013. Total numbers of cases of female sexual assault was 130 over the studied years. The mean (SD) age of victims was 15.2 (6) years ranging from 4 to 40 years. Fifty-eight percent fall in the age group of 12 to 18 years. Most victims (61.5%) came from urban areas. Summer was relatively a vulnerable season for sexual assault (53.1%); 81.5% of victims was unmarried and 94.6% with normal mentality. The highest percentage of sexual assault crime was found in females with primary education (44.6%). Twenty-two (16.9%) of the assaulted cases were considered intrafamilial assault, whereas 83.1% were extrafamilial. The most common location for assaults was at the assailant's home (50.8%), and 80% of the victims were exposed to assault by 1 assailant. The shortest time between alleged assault and the examination was 1 day in 12 cases (9.2%). The most frequent type of assault was complete vaginal penetration (48.55%). The most common type of physical injury was abrasions (48.1%), whereas the least was burn or broken teeth (1.3% for each). The highest percentage of genital injury was lacerations (36.4%), and the most common location was the hymen (36.4%). 


Potassium channel modulation by a toxin domain in matrix metalloprotease 23.

Behavioral and neurochemical characterization of mice deficient in the N-type Ca2+ channel alpha1B subunit. N-type voltage-dependent calcium channels (VDCCs) play an important role in neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and brain development. They are composed of several subunits named alpha(1), alpha(2), delta, beta and gamma. The alpha(1) subunit is essential for channel functions and determines fundamental channel properties. Since N-type VDCC are critically involved in the release of neurotransmitters and clinical relevance, we predicted that alpha(1) subunit KO mice would show several alterations in behavior. In the present study, we investigated neuronal functions in mice lacking the alpha(1B) (Ca(V)2.2) subunit of the N-type calcium channels. Ca(V)2.2(-/-) mice exhibited a significant increase in locomotion on an activity wheel during the dark phase. Furthermore, when challenged with apomorphine, mutant mice showed enhanced locomotor activity. Cognitive functions were examined using a Y-maze task for short-term memory and a passive avoidance task for long-term memory. The Y-maze revealed no differences in spontaneous alternation behavior between mutant and wild-type mice. The passive avoidance test revealed that the latency time in mutant mice was significantly decreased. The mutant mice showed prepulse inhibition deficits reminiscent of the sensorimotor gating deficits observed in a large majority of schizophrenic patients. Decreases in baseline levels of dopamine and serotonin within the striata and frontal cortices of mutant mice were also observed. These results suggest that Ca(2+) in the central nervous system modulates various neurophysiological functions, such as locomotor activity, long-term memory, and sensorimotor gating through the alpha(1B) subunit of the N-type calcium channels.

Ribosomal DNA, heterochromatin, and correlation with genome size in diploid and polyploid North American endemic sagebrushes (Artemisia, Asteraceae). Subgenus Tridentatae (Artemisia, Asteraceae) can be considered a polyploid complex. Both polyploidy and hybridization have been documented in the Tridentatae. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and fluorochrome banding were used to detect and analyze ribosomal DNA changes linked to polyploidization in this group by studying four diploid-polyploid species pairs. In addition, genome sizes and heterochromatin patterns were compared between these populations. The linked 5S and 35S rRNA genes are confirmed as characteristic for Artemisia, and a pattern at the diploid level of three rDNA loci located at telomeric positions proved to be typical. Loss of rDNA loci was observed in some polyploids, whereas others showed additivity with respect to their diploid relatives. Genome downsizing was observed in all polyploids. Banding patterns differed depending on the pair of species analysed, but some polyploid populations showed an increased number of heterochromatic bands. FISH and fluorochrome banding were useful in determining the systematic position of Artemisia bigelovii, for which a differential pattern was found as compared with the rest of the group. Additionally, FISH was used to detect the presence of the Arabidopsis-type telomere repeat for the first time in Artemisia.

Folate, homocysteine, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor alfa levels, but not the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase C677T polymorphism, are risk factors for schizophrenia. The methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T mutation has been associated to high homocysteine levels and schizophrenia. Since cytokines are altered in schizophrenia and increments of homocysteine could promote an inflammatory response, it was investigated whether interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNFalpha) levels are modulated by the MTHFR genotype. Serum levels of TNFalpha, IL-6, B(12), homocysteine, folate and red blood cell (RBC) folate as well as the MTHFR genotype were determined in a group of schizophrenic patients and compared to those of a control group. RBC folate levels were reduced and homocysteine and the two cytokines' concentrations were elevated in all patients as compared to controls. RBC folate in both heterozygous (CT) and homozygous (TT) patients was significantly different to that of their respective control groups. Homocysteine levels found in patients were significantly higher than those found in controls, only in individuals carrying the TT genotype. Cytokine levels were augmented in the group of patients irrespective of the genotype, and significant differences were found in all cases, except for TNFalpha levels in those subjects carrying the CC genotype. After adjusting for sex, low levels of RBC folate, high levels of homocysteine, both medium and high levels of TNFalpha and high IL-6 levels were associated with schizophrenia. MTHFR genotype was not a risk factor for developing the disease, although a larger sample is required to confirm this finding.


Effects of landmark distance and stability on accuracy of reward relocation.

First report of the concentrations and implications of DDT residues in chicken eggs from a malaria-controlled area. In malaria-endemic areas, where DDT is still used for vector control by indoor residual spraying (IRS), the concentrations of DDT in human blood and breast milk are high, and there are indications of human health impacts. To identify the possible avenues of exposure reduction, we created the concept of a Total Homestead Environment Approach (THEA). THEA characterizes the interactions between DDT, humans, and the biota within and around homesteads. One dietary route of human exposure and uptake of DDT, namely, chicken egg consumption, has to our knowledge never been studied. The Î£DDT in eggs from a DDT-sprayed village ranged between 5200 and 48,000 ng/g wm (wet mass), with a median of 11,000 ng/g wm. On a lipid mass-basis (lm), the mean Î£DDT for eggs from the sprayed village was 100,000 ng/g lm. The maximum egg concentration observed was three orders of magnitude higher than the median. The acceptable daily intake (ADI) was not exceeded based on the consumption of three eggs per week for a 60 kg person. This equates to an intake of 0.089 g DDT per person per year. Chicken egg consumption is therefore a possible target for exposure reduction, probably best achieved by reducing the DDT concentrations in soils.

Managing dental caries in children in Turkey--a discussion paper. This paper describes the oral healthcare system and disease situation amongst children in Turkey. Considering the high prevalence and severity of dental caries, a proposal for improvement of oral health in this population group is formulated. A virtual absence of palliative, preventive and restorative care characterises juvenile oral healthcare in Turkey. Consequently, carious cavities remain untreated, which may lead to pain, discomfort and functional limitation and, further, may impact negatively upon general health and cognitive development. As a first step to controlling dental caries, a national health programme including promotional, preventive and minimal intervention approaches for managing dental caries is proposed. The pros and cons of community-oriented caries-preventive measures are discussed. Daily tooth brushing with fluoridated toothpaste at home, in mother- and child-care centres, kindergartens, and schools is highlighted. The dental profession, government, university officials and other stakeholders need to meet and determine how best the oral health of children in Turkey can be improved. The present proposed plan is considered a starting point.

Ultrastructural study of cultured ovine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells. Ovine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (oBM-MSCs) represent a good animal model for cell-based therapy and tissue engineering. Despite their use as a new therapeutic tool for several clinical applications, the morphological features of oBM-MSCs are yet unknown. Therefore, in this study the ultrastructural phenotype of these cells was analysed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The oBM-MSCs were isolated from the iliac crest and cultured until they reached near-confluence. After trypsinization, they were processed to investigate their ultrastructural features as well as specific surface marker proteins by flow cytometry and immunogold electron microscopy. Flow cytometry displayed that all oBM-MSCs lacked expression of CD31, CD34, CD45, HLA-DR whereas they expressed CD44, CD58, HLAI and a minor subset of the cell population (12%) exhibited CD90. TEM revealed the presence of two morphologically distinct cell types: cuboidal electron-lucent cells and spindle-shaped electron-dense cells, both expressing the CD90 antigen. Most of the electron-lucent cells showed glycogen aggregates, dilated cisternae of RER, moderately developed Golgi complex, and secretory activity. The electron-dense cell type was constituted by two different cell-populations: type A cells with numerous endosomes, dense bodies, rod-shaped mitochondria and filopodia; type B cells with elongated mitochondria, thin pseudopodia and cytoplasmic connectivity with electron-lucent cells. These morphological findings could provide a useful support to identify "in situ" the cellular components involved in the cell-therapy when cultured oBM-MSCs are injected.

CSF proteomic analysis in patients with normal pressure hydrocephalus selected for the shunt: CSF biomarkers of response to surgical treatment. The aim of our pilot study was to investigate, by a proteomic approach, the expressed differences in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein patterns in order to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). Seventeen patients with NPH, selected by Intracranial-Pressure monitoring (ICPmo), underwent implantation of a shunt and after 6 months were clinically re-evaluated. Thirteen patients improved, whereas four did not. During ICPmo CSF was collected and its proteoma was analyzed by 2D gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The over-expression of alpha2HS glycoprotein, alpha1 antichimotrypsin and alpha1beta glycoprotein and the under-expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein, apolipoproteins (AIV, J and E), complement C3c, anti-thrombin, alpha2 antiplasmin and albumin seem to be associated with a positive response to surgery. Most of these proteins have been reported to be altered in Alzheimer disease, supporting the hypothesis of a possible link between these two nosological entities.

A paradigm for epileptic seizure prediction using a coupled oscillator model of the brain. This paper presents a novel theoretical paradigm for epileptic seizure prediction based on a coupled oscillator model of brain dynamics. This model is used to investigate prediction methods capable of tracking the synchronization changes that may lead to a seizure. Previous results indicate that state-space reconstruction of a coupled oscillator model from an EEG-like signal is ill-posed, therefore, monitoring system synchronization via the EEG signal is unlikely to give advanced warning of imminent seizure activity. Through simulation, it is shown that synchronization tracking may still be viable using an input probing stimulus to actively seek information from the coupled oscillator network.

Health care costs and work absenteeism in smokers: study in an urban community. Higher morbidity caused by smoking-related diseases could increase health costs. We analyzed differences in the use of healthcare resources, healthcare costs and days of work absenteeism among smokers and non-smokers. Cross-sectional study in smokers and non-smokers, aged between 45 and 74 years, from one urban health area. The variables studied were: age, sex, alcohol intake, physical activity, obesity, diseases, attendance at primary care clinics and hospital emergency rooms, days of hospitalization, prescription drug consumption and work absenteeism (in days). Annual cost according to the unit cost of each service (direct costs), and indirect costs according to the number of days missed from work was calculated. Crude and adjusted risks were calculated using logistic regression. Five hundred patients were included: 50% were smokers, 74% (372) men and 26% (128) women. Smokers used more healthcare resources, consumed more prescription drugs and had more days off work than non-smokers. Respective direct and indirect costs in smokers were 848.64 euros (IQ 25-75: 332.65-1517.10) and 2253.90 euros (IQ 25-75: 1024.50-13113.60), and in non-smokers were 474.71 euros (IQ 25-75: 172.88-979.59) and 1434.30 euros (IQ 25-75: 614.70-4712.70). The likelihood of generating high healthcare costs was more than double for smokers (OR=2.14; 95% CI: 1.44-3.19). More investment in programs for the prevention and treatment of smoking, as a health policy priority, could help to reduce the health and social costs of smoking.


Tracheoesophageal voice after total laryngopharyngectomy reconstruction: Jejunum versus radial forearm free flap.

Effect of slow-velocity lengthening contractions on muscle damage induced by fast-velocity lengthening contractions. This study tested the hypothesis that the first exercise bout consisting of slow-velocity (30Â° Â· s(-1)) maximal lengthening contractions would not affect muscle damage in a subsequent bout consisting of fast-velocity (210Â° Â· s(-1)) lengthening contractions. Eighteen men were randomly assigned into either a repeated bout group (n = 10) or control group (n = 8). The repeated bout group performed 2 bouts of exercise consisting of 210 maximal lengthening contractions of the elbow flexors separated by 14 days at a velocity of 30Â° Â· s(-1) for the first and 210Â° Â· s(-1) for the second bout. The control group performed a single bout of the fast-velocity exercise. Changes in maximal isometric strength, range of motion (ROM), upper-arm circumference, muscle thickness, muscle soreness, serum creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase activities were measured before, immediately after, and 24 to 96 hours after exercise. The repeated bout group showed significantly (p < 0.05) smaller changes in all criterion measures except for muscle soreness after the fast-velocity exercise compared with the control group. A significant (p < 0.05) difference was evident only for ROM between the slow- and fast-velocity bouts of the repeated bout group. These results suggest that slow-velocity exercise reduced muscle damage induced by fast-velocity exercise, although the reduction was not large.

[Pulmonary Rehabilitation for Cancer Patients]. Dyspnea occurs in most cancer patients and is often associated with severe pain. Pulmonary rehabilitation has become increasingly important to improve ADL and QOL and to relieve pain that results from dyspnea. Although pulmonary rehabilitation is now provided mainly during the perioperative period, it has been recognized as an effective procedure for patients before, during, or after chemotherapy or radiotherapy. It is also useful for patients with advanced or terminal cancer. However, an evidence-based cancer rehabilitation procedure has to be established.

Neuronal pathways involved in deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus for treatment of Parkinson's disease. In this study, fixed potential amperometry was used to examine several pathways by which Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or dopamine axons within the dorsal forebrain bundle (DFB) release striatal dopamine, thus potentially providing therapeutic benefits for Parkinson's Disease patients. In urethane anesthetized mice, electrical stimulations (20 monophasic pulses at 50 Hz every 30 sec) were applied to the STN or DFB while infusing the local anesthetic lidocaine (4%) into the substantia nigra compacta (SNc) or pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (PPT). Findings suggest that DFB stimulation activates ascending SNc dopamine axons, while STN stimulation evokes striatal dopamine release directly via excitatory glutamatergic inputs to SNc dopamine cells and indirectly via excitatory cholinergic/glutamatergic STN-PPT-SNc pathways.

Role of DNA methylation in renal cell carcinoma. Alterations in DNA methylation are seen in cancers and have also been examined in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). Numerous tumor suppressor genes have been reported to be partially or completely silenced due to hypermethylation of their promoters in single-locus studies, and the use of hypomethylating agents has been shown to restore the expression of many of these genes in vitro. In particular, members of the Wnt and TGF-beta pathways, pro-apoptotic genes such as APAF-1 and negative cell-cycle regulators such as KILLIN have been shown to be epigenetically silenced in numerous studies in ccRCC. Recently, TCGA analysis of a large cohort of ccRCC samples demonstrated that aberrant hypermethylation correlated with the stage and grade in kidney cancer. Our genome-wide studies also revealed aberrant widespread hypermethylation that affected regulatory regions of the kidney genome in ccRCC. We also observed that aberrant enhancer hypermethylation was predictive of adverse prognosis in ccRCC. Recent discovery of mutations affecting epigenetic regulators reinforces the importance of these changes in the pathophysiology of ccRCC and points to the potential of epigenetic modulators in the treatment of this malignancy. 

Autonomous plasmid-like replication of Bacillus ICEBs1: a general feature of integrative conjugative elements? Integrative conjugative elements (ICEs) occur frequently in Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In contrast to plasmids, they are stably integrated in the bacterial genome, often inserted in a tRNA gene. They are excised from the host chromosome upon induction in order to be transferred to a recipient cell. When conjugative transfer is completed, they stably reintegrate in the chromosome. It is generally thought that ICEs are incapable of autonomous replication, instead relying on replication and segregation along with the host chromosome. In this issue of Molecular Microbiology Lee and co-workers demonstrate that ICEBs1 from Bacillus subtilis is capable of autonomous plasmid-like replication in its circular form after excision. The authors show that ICEBs1 replication is unidirectional; it initiates at oriT(ICEBs1) and requires the ICEBs1-encoded conjugative relaxase NicK. Replication also requires the catalytic subunit of the host DNA polymerase PolC, the host processivity clamp DnaN and the host-encoded alternative helicase PcrA. Autonomous replication of ICEBs1 appears to be important for its stable maintenance, but not for horizontal transfer of the element. Lee and co-workers argue that plasmid-like replication is likely a common property of ICEs, probably contributing to stability and maintenance of ICEs in bacterial populations. I discuss these findings in context with data on other ICEs from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and with respect to possible consequences of the findings for basic research on mobile genetic elements from Gram-positive bacteria and their applications in biotechnology.

Quantifying police officers' arrest and self-defence skills: does performance decrease under pressure? This study investigated police officers' performance on five selected arrest and self-defence skills that are regularly used in the line of duty. In Experiment 1 a 5-point scale to measure skill performance was developed and tested with 14 police instructors. Results showed that the new scale has satisfactory inter-rater reliability and good intra-rater reliability. In Experiment 2, the external and concurrent validity of the scale was tested by measuring the performances of 19 police officers executing the same skills in a high- and a low-pressure environment and comparing the results obtained with the new 5-point scale with results obtained with a currently used binary scale (i.e. sufficient/insufficient). While the scale proved to have good external and concurrent validity, it appeared that the police officers' performance really suffered under pressure. Given the criticality of successful police performance, it is suggested that incorporating psychological factors (e.g. pressure) in training procedures may enhance performance.

The novel peptide F29 facilitates the DNA-binding ability of hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1alpha/beta (HIF-1alpha/beta) is a heterodimeric transcriptional activator that mediates gene expression in response to hypoxia. HIF-1alpha has been noted as an effective therapeutic target for ischemic diseases such as myocardiac infarction, stroke and cancer. By using a yeast two-hybrid system and a random peptide library, we found a 16-mer peptide named F29 that directly interacts with the bHLH-PAS domain of HIF-1alpha. We found that F29 facilitates the interaction of the HIF-1alpha/beta heterodimer with its target DNA sequence, hypoxia-responsive element (HRE). The transient transfection of an F29-expressing plasmid increases the expression of both an HRE-driven luciferase gene and the endogenous HIF-1 target gene, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Taken together, we conclude that F29 increases the DNA-binding ability of HIF-1alpha, leading to increased expression of its target gene VEGF. Our results suggest that F29 can be a lead compound that directly targets HIF-1alpha and increases its activity.

Polylactide stereocomplex-based electrospun materials possessing surface with antibacterial and hemostatic properties. Novel fibrous materials of stereocomplex between high-molecular-weight poly(d- or l-)lactide (HMPDLA or HMPLLA) and diblock copolymers consisting of poly(l- or d-)lactide and poly(N,N-dimethylamino-2-ethyl methacrylate) blocks, respectively (PLLA-block-PDMAEMA or PDLA-block-PDMAEMA), were prepared by solution electrospinning. Fibers with mean diameters ranging from 1400 to 1700 nm were obtained. The stereocomplex formation was evidenced by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analyses. Annealing at 100 degrees C for 8 h resulted in the appearance of crystalline peaks at 2theta values of 12, 21, and 24 degrees for PLA stereocomplex. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses revealed the gradient composition of the fibers with a surface enriched in tertiary amino groups from PDMAEMA blocks. The availability of tertiary amino groups imparts hemostatic and antibacterial properties to the stereocomplex fibrous materials, as indicated by the performed tests on blood cells and on pathogenic microorganisms.

Cloning and characterization of porcine NOBOX gene. Newborn ovary homeobox gene (NOBOX) is an oocyte-specific homeobox gene that plays a critical role in early folliculogenesis and represents a candidate gene for nonsyndromic ovarian failure. We used in silico approach in combination with rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) to clone the full-length cDNA of NOBOX (GenBank Accession No. FJ587509) from porcine oocytes. It contains 1768 bp nucleotides, with an open reading frame (ORF) of 1419 bp. The putative porcine NOBOX gene encodes 472 amino acids with the molecular weight of 51.08 kD and pI of 5.73. Bioinformatics prediction indicates that this protein contains a cd00086 homeodomain. Real-time PCR analysis showed that the NOBOX gene is expressed in various tissues, oocytes and embryos cells (4-cell, 8-cell, morula and blastocyst) at different expression levels. The expression levels of this gene in heart, kidney and oocytes are higher than that in other tissues, which suggested that the NOBOX protein might play an important role in those tissues. The expression of NOBOX in developmental stages is higher than that in GV-stage oocytes, which suggested that the expression of pNOBOX was enhanced in developmental stages.

Histopathology of the arachnoid granulations and brain in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis: correlation with cerebrospinal fluid pressure. To investigate the histopathology of the arachnoid granulations in patients with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis and correlate the findings with clinical data, in particular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) opening pressure. Case series. Postmortems were requested on patients dying during initial hospitalization with HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis. Five postmortems were performed. Large numbers of cryptococcal cells were seen within the arachnoid granulations. The number of fungal cells correlated with CSF pressure. Inflammatory cell infiltrates and disruption of the normal architecture of the granulations were also observed. The study provides the first direct evidence supporting the obstruction to CSF reabsorption at the level of the arachnoid granulations as the main mechanism underlying the development of raised CSF pressure in HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis.

Analysis of Enterococcus faecalis in samples from Turkish patients with primary endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatment by real-time PCR SYBR green method. The aims of this study were to investigate the presence of Enterococcus faecalis in primary endodontic infections and failed endodontic treatments using real-time PCR and to determine the statistical importance of the presence of E. faecalis in a Turkish population with endodontic infections. E. faecalis was investigated from 79 microbial samples collected from patients who were treated at the Endodontic Clinic of the Dental School of AtatÃ¼rk University (Erzurum, Turkey). Microbial samples were taken from 43 patients (Group 1) with failed endodontic treatments and 36 patients (Group 2) with chronic apical periodontitis (primary endodontic infections). DNA was extracted from the samples by using a QIAamp DNA mini-kit and analyzed with real-time PCR SYBR Green. E. faecalis was detected in 41 out of 79 patients, suggesting that it exists in not less than 61% of all endodontic infections when the proportion test (z= -1.645, <x= 0.05) was applied. Real-time PCR SYBR Green allowed for the detection of E. faecalis in 32 out of 43 (74.4%) in Group 1, and in 9 out of 36 (25%) in Group 2. These results suggest that E. faecalis is a frequent isolate for endodontic infections in Turkish patients, and is more often associated with failed endodontic treatments than primary endodontic infections.


Brentuximab Vedotin in CD30-Positive Lymphomas: A SIE, SIES, and GITMO Position Paper.

Lactobacillus florum sp. nov., a fructophilic species isolated from flowers. Three strains of fructophilic lactic acid bacteria were isolated from flowers in South Africa. The isolates formed a subcluster in the Lactobacillus buchneri phylogenetic group, closely related to Lactobacillus fructivorans, Lactobacillus homohiochii, Lactobacillus lindneri and Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis according to phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences. Levels of DNA-DNA relatedness indicated that the three strains belonged to the same taxon and formed a genetically distinct group, well separated from their phylogenetic relatives. The three strains produced acids from only two of the 49 carbohydrates tested, i.e. D-glucose and D-fructose. D-Fructose was more rapidly fermented than D-glucose. Good growth was recorded on d-fructose or D-glucose in the presence of external electron acceptors. However, delayed growth was recorded on d-glucose without electron acceptors. The novel strains produced lactic acid, ethanol and acetic acid from D-glucose at a ratio of 1â:â0.8â:â0.2. These characteristics were distinct from other species of the genus Lactobacillus. Based on the data provided, the three isolates represent a fructophilic and novel species of the genus Lactobacillus, for which the name Lactobacillus florum sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is F9-1(T) (=JCM 16035(T)=DSM 22689(T)=NRIC 0771(T)).

Pulse-clamp technique for single neuron stimulation electrode characterization. Miniaturized electrodes, structures and devices are necessary to achieve high target selectivity during stimulation in single neuron networks, while significant charge transfer is still demanded. A reliable test method is required to evaluate charge injection capability for high resolution neural stimulation applications that demand both a large amount of charge injection and a small electrode size. A circuit designed for the pulse-clamp technique was employed to characterize the electrode charge-storage capability of microelectrodes of sizes smaller than 300 microm in diameter. The circuit allows different electrodes and surface modifications to be quickly and accurately compared. Pulse-clamp measurements are performed on planar microelectrodes in 154 mM phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution with 400 micros long pulses at charges up to 40 nC. The pulse-clamp and cyclic voltammetry results of sputtered iridium oxide film (SIROF) electrodes of different sizes show charge losses of less than 3% and a superior reversible charge injection capability compared to platinum microelectrodes of the same size, even at higher charge density levels.

SUMO modification regulates BLM and RAD51 interaction at damaged replication forks. The gene mutated in Bloom's syndrome, BLM, is important in the repair of damaged replication forks, and it has both pro- and anti-recombinogenic roles in homologous recombination (HR). At damaged forks, BLM interacts with RAD51 recombinase, the essential enzyme in HR that catalyzes homology-dependent strand invasion. We have previously shown that defects in BLM modification by the small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) cause increased gamma-H2AX foci. Because the increased gamma-H2AX could result from defective repair of spontaneous DNA damage, we hypothesized that SUMO modification regulates BLM's function in HR repair at damaged forks. To test this hypothesis, we treated cells that stably expressed a normal BLM (BLM+) or a SUMO-mutant BLM (SM-BLM) with hydroxyurea (HU) and examined the effects of stalled replication forks on RAD51 and its DNA repair functions. HU treatment generated excess gamma-H2AX in SM-BLM compared to BLM+ cells, consistent with a defect in replication-fork repair. SM-BLM cells accumulated increased numbers of DNA breaks and were hypersensitive to DNA damage. Importantly, HU treatment failed to induce sister-chromatid exchanges in SM-BLM cells compared to BLM+ cells, indicating a specific defect in HR repair and suggesting that RAD51 function could be compromised. Consistent with this hypothesis, RAD51 localization to HU-induced repair foci was impaired in SM-BLM cells. These data suggested that RAD51 might interact noncovalently with SUMO. We found that in vitro RAD51 interacts noncovalently with SUMO and that it interacts more efficiently with SUMO-modified BLM compared to unmodified BLM. These data suggest that SUMOylation controls the switch between BLM's pro- and anti-recombinogenic roles in HR. In the absence of BLM SUMOylation, BLM perturbs RAD51 localization at damaged replication forks and inhibits fork repair by HR. Conversely, BLM SUMOylation relieves its inhibitory effects on HR, and it promotes RAD51 function.

[Simultaneous analysis of 7 fluoroquinolone residues in chicken muscle by ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry]. A confirmative method of ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS/MS) for the simultaneous determination of 7 fluoroquinolone residues (norfloxacin (NOR), ciprofloxacin (CIP), danofloxacin (DAN), enrofloxacin (ENR), ofloxacin (OFL), sarafloxacin (SAR) and marbofloxacin (MAR)) in chicken muscle was developed. The sample was extracted with acidified acetonitrile, defatted with n-hexane, and purified by an HLB solid phase extraction cartridge. The UPLC separation was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (50 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 microm) utilizing a gradient elution program of acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% formic acid) as the mobile phase. The identification and quantification were achieved by using ESI-MS/MS in positive ion mode and multiple reaction monitoring (MRM). The linear ranges were from 5 to 100 microg/kg with the correlation coefficients above 0.99 for all the 7 fluoroquinolones. The average recoveries spiked at the 3 concentration levels of 5, 25, 50 microg/kg ranged from 79. 2% to 108.6% with the relative standard deviations of 4.2% - 8.9%. The limits of detection were 0.2 - 1.4 microg/kg. The method was proved to be good reproducibility, high sensitivity, rapid, reliable and suitable for the simultaneous determination of multi-residues of fluoroquinolones in chicken muscle.


A nationwide survey of oncologists regarding treatment-related infertility and fertility preservation in female cancer patients.

Liposome encapsulated of temozolomide for the treatment of glioma tumor: preparation, characterization and evaluation. Temozolomide plays a critical role in curing glioma at present. The purpose of this work was to develop a suitable drug delivery system which could prolong the half-life, improve the brain targeting, and reduce the systemic effect of the drug. Temozolomide-liposomes were formulated by the method of proliposomes. They were found to be relatively uniform in size of 156.70 Â± 11.40 nm with a narrow polydispersity index (PI) of 0.29 Â± 0.04. The average drug entrapment efficiency and loading capacity were 35.45 Â± 1.48% and 2.81 Â± 0.20%, respectively. The pH of temozolomide-liposomes was 6.46. In vitro release studies were conducted by a dynamic dialysis. The results showed that temozolomide released slowly from liposomes compared with the solution group. The release behavior of temozolomide-liposomes was in line with First-order kinetics and Weibull equation. The pharmacokinetics study was evaluated by pharmacokinetics parameters. The t(1/2Î²) and MRT of temozolomide-liposomes were 3.57 times and 1.27 times greater than that of temozolomide solution. The Cmax and AUC values of temozolomide-liposomes were 1.10 times and 1.55 times greater than that of temozolomide solution. The results of pharmacokinetics study showed temozolomide-liposomes prolonged the in vivo circulation time and increased AUC. Furthermore, the biodistribution in mice showed that temozolomide-liposomes preferentially decreased the accumulation of temozolomide in heart and lung and increased the drug concentration in brain after i.v. injection, which implied that temozolomide-liposomes improved the therapeutic effect in the brain and reduced the toxicity in lung and heart.

[A case of brainstem variant of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome]. A rare case of a brainstem variant of reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) is reported. A 34-year-old man with a past history of untreated chronic renal failure and hypertension was admitted to our hospital complaining of severe nuchal headache lasting for about four days. His neurological examination was normal, however physical examination revealed his blood pressure was 216/120 mmHg. Computed tomography imaging (CT) showed his brain stem with a low attenuation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive hyperintensity and enlargement of the midbrain and pons on T2 weighted and fluid attenuated inversion-recovery (FLAIR) image. However, there was no abnormal lesion seen in either bilateral occipital lobe. Diffusion-weighted image (DWI) was normal at the brainstem, but apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were slightly elevated at the left midbrain. There was no contrast enhancement. His symptom and radiological finding improved soon after his blood pressure was controlled. A repeated MRI taken two weeks later showed complete resolution of the lesion. RPLS associated with predominant involvement of the brainstem and sparing of the supratentorial region is rare, but it should be differentiated from brain stem infarction, pontine glioma, central pontine myelinolysis and infective encephalitis, since the neulological consequences are potentially fully reversible after adequate and prompt treatment.

[Aggregative ability of thrombocytes and their receptor apparatus at a distant period after different operations on the injured spleen]. The aggregative ability of thrombocytes and the composition of the carbohydrate component of the thrombocyte glycoprotein receptors were studied in 126 patients after operations on the injured spleen within the terms of more than one year. It was found that organ-sparing operations and autolientransplantation in the injured spleen did not influence the changes of the thrombocyte aggregative properties at a remote postoperative period. Splenectomy results in an increased aggregative ability of thrombocytes at the expense of increased number of glycoprotein receptors containing D-mannose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamines, D-galactose, N-acetyl-D-glucosamines, N- acetylneuraminic acid and D-galactose.


Five new Mexican species of the flea genus Strepsylla Traub, 1950 (Siphonaptera: Ctenophthalmidae: Neopsyllinae: Phalacropsyllini) with a phylogenetic analysis.

Low intensity pulsed ultrasound increases the mechanical properties of the healing tissues at bone-tendon junction. The re-establishment of bone-tendon junction (BTJ) tissues is involved in many trauma and reconstructive surgeries. A direct BTJ repair requires a long period of immobilization which may be associated with a postoperative weak knee. In this study, we investigated if low-intensity pulsed ultrasound treatment increases the material properties of healing tissues at bone-tendon junction (BTJ) after partial patellectomy using rabbit models. Standard partial patellectomy was conducted on one knee of twenty four rabbits which were randomly divided into an ultrasound group and a control group. The bony changes of BTJ complexes around the BTJ healing interface were measured by anteroposterior x-ray radiographs; then the volumetric bone-mineral density (BMD) of the new bone was assessed using a peripheral computed tomography scanner (pQCT). The stiffness of patellar cartilage, fibrocartilage at the healing interface and the tendon were measured in situ using a novel noncontact ultrasound water jet indentation system. Not only significantly more newly formed bone at the BTJ healing interface but also increased stiffness of the junction tissues were found in the ultrasound group compared with the controls at week 18. In addition, the ultrasound group also showed significantly 44% higher BMD at week 6 than controls.

Molecular recognition and drug-lead identification: what can molecular simulations tell us? Molecular recognition and ligand binding involving proteins underlie the most important life processes within the cell, such as substrate transport, catalysis, signal transmission, receptor trafficking, gene regulation, switching on and off of biochemical pathways. Despite recent successes in predicting the structures of many protein-substrate complexes, the dynamic aspects of binding have been largely neglected by computational/theoretical investigations. Recently, several groups have started tackling these problems with the use of experimental and simulation methods and developed models describing the variation of protein dynamics upon complex formation, shedding light on how substrate or inhibitor binding can alter protein flexibility and function. The study of ligand-induced dynamic variations has also been exploited to review the concept of allosteric changes, in the absence of major conformational changes. In this context, the study of the influence of protein motions on signal transduction and on catalytic activities has been used to develop pharmacophore models based on ensembles of protein conformations. These models, taking flexibility explicitly into account, are able to distinguish active inhibitors versus nonactive drug-like compounds, to define new molecular motifs and to preferentially identify specific ligands for a certain protein target. The application of these methods holds great promise in advancing structure-based drug discovery and medicinal chemistry in general, opening up the possibility to explore broader chemical spaces than is normally done in an efficient way. In this review, examples illustrating the extent to which simulations can be used to understand these phenomena will be presented along with examples of methodological developments to increase physical understanding of the processes and improve the possibility to rationally design new molecules.


The interleukin-6, serotonin transporter, and monoamine oxidase A genes and endurance performance during the South African Ironman Triathlon.

Three-dimensional high-resolution optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging of human kidney. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a rapidly emerging imaging modality that can non-invasively provide cross-sectional, high-resolution images of tissue morphology in situ and in real-time. Previous studies have demonstrated that OCT is capable of accurately visualizing the pathological changes in the living kidney in vivo using the Munich-Wistar rat model. In this work, we establish, for the first time, the capability of OCT to image the intact human kidney ex vivo. Characteristic kidney anatomic structures including the blood vessels, uriniferous tubules, glomeruli, and kidney capsules can be readily discerned. The diameter and volume parameters of these structures can also be automatically quantified. These two parameters may be critical in clinical applications such as the assessment of the donor kidney's viability prior to transplantation, or image the kidney responses to ischemic insult.


GREB1 tissue expression is associated with organ-confined prostate cancer.

Testing reported associations of genetic risk factors for oral clefts in a large Irish study population. Suggestive, but not conclusive, studies implicate many genetic variants in oral cleft etiology. We used a large, ethnically homogenous study population to test whether reported associations between nonsyndromic oral clefts and 12 genes (CLPTM1, CRISPLD2, FGFR2, GABRB3, GLI2, IRF6, PTCH1, RARA, RYK, SATB2, SUMO1, TGFA) could be confirmed. Thirty-one single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in exons, splice sites, and conserved non-coding regions were studied in 509 patients with cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP), 383 with cleft palate only (CP), 838 mothers and 719 fathers of patients with oral clefts, and 902 controls from Ireland. Case-control and family-based statistical tests were performed using isolated oral clefts for the main analyses. In case-control comparisons, the minor allele of PTCH1 A562A (rs2066836) was associated with reduced odds of CLP (odds ratios [OR], 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.13-0.64 for homozygotes), whereas the minor allele of PTCH1 L1315P (rs357564) was associated with increased odds of CLP (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.07-1.74 for heterozygotes; and OR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.09-2.24 for homozygotes). The minor allele of one SUMO1 SNP, rs3769817 located in intron 2, was associated with increased odds of CP (OR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.06-1.99 for heterozygotes). Transmission disequilibrium was observed for the minor allele of TGFA V159V (rs2166975) which was over-transmitted to CP cases (p = 0.041). For 10 of the 12 genes, this is the largest candidate gene study of nonsyndromic oral clefts to date. The findings provide further evidence that PTCH1, SUMO1, and TGFA contribute to nonsyndromic oral clefts.

Drug-related damage of the ageing gastrointestinal tract. Drug use increases with age and the elderly is at increased risk of adverse drug reactions. Gastrointestinal adverse effects are one of the most often reported. Serious event are mostly caused by NSAIDs and/or aspirin which are the most widely prescribed medications in the world. NSAIDs and/or aspirin use are associated with complications from both the upper and the lower gastrointestinal tract. The risk of these complications depends on presence of risk factors, and age is the most frequent and relevant one. At-risk patients should be on prevention strategies including the use of the lowest effective dose, co-therapy with a gastroprotective agents or use of a COX-2 selective agent. Treatment of Helicobacter pylori infection is beneficial in patients starting therapy with these agents, especially in the presence of ulcer history. The best strategy to prevent lower GI complications has yet to be defined.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia: a consensus statement on diagnostic and treatment approaches in children. Primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) is associated with abnormal ciliary structure and function, which results in retention of mucus and bacteria in the respiratory tract, leading to chronic oto-sino-pulmonary disease, situs abnormalities and abnormal sperm motility. The diagnosis of PCD requires the presence of the characteristic clinical phenotype and either specific ultrastructural ciliary defects identified by transmission electron microscopy or evidence of abnormal ciliary function. Although the management of children affected with PCD remains uncertain and evidence is limited, it remains important to follow-up these patients with an adequate and shared care system in order to prevent future lung damage. This European Respiratory Society consensus statement on the management of children with PCD formulates recommendations regarding diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in order to permit a more accurate approach in these patients. Large well-designed randomised controlled trials, with clear description of patients, are required in order to improve these recommendations on diagnostic and treatment approaches in this disease.

Parathyroid hormone and its receptor gene polymorphisms: implications in osteoporosis and in fracture healing. Parathyroid glands secrete parathyroid hormone (PTH) which plays multiple roles in calcium homeostasis and in bone remodeling. Secretion of PTH is regulated by extracellular calcium levels and other humoral factors including 1Î±,25(OH)2D3. PTH regulates gene expression and induces biological effects directly and indirectly. The human gene encoding PTH is located on chromosome 11. In this review, we study the diverse PTH along with its receptor gene polymorphisms and their association with osteoporosis and fracture healing. Genetic factors are associated with osteoporosis by influencing bone mineral density (BMD), bone turnover, calcium homeostasis, and susceptibility to osteoporotic fractures. Polymorphisms in genes encoding PTH may contribute to genetic regulation of BMD and thus susceptibility to fracture risk. PTH stimulates the proliferation of osteoprogenitor cells, production of alkaline phosphatise, and bone matrix proteins that contribute to hard callus formation and increases strength at the site of fractured bone. During remodeling, PTH promotes osteoclastogenesis restoring the original shape, structure, and mechanical strength of the bone. Some PTH polymorphisms have shown an association with fracture risk. Further research is needed to elucidate the relative importance of PTH genetics and the mechanisms of genetic contributions to gene-gene interactions in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis and in fracture healing.

Angiosperm genome comparisons reveal early polyploidy in the monocot lineage. Although the timing and extent of a whole-genome duplication occurring in the common lineage of most modern cereals are clear, the existence or extent of more ancient genome duplications in cereals and perhaps other monocots has been hinted at, but remain unclear. We present evidence of additional duplication blocks of deeper hierarchy than the pancereal rho (rho) duplication, covering at least 20% of the cereal transcriptome. These more ancient duplicated regions, herein called sigma, are evident in both intragenomic and intergenomic analyses of rice and sorghum. Resolution of such ancient duplication events improves the understanding of the early evolutionary history of monocots and the origins and expansions of gene families. Comparisons of syntenic blocks reveal clear structural similarities in putatively homologous regions of monocots (rice) and eudicots (grapevine). Although the exact timing of the sigma-duplication(s) is unclear because of uncertainties of the molecular clock assumption, our data suggest that it occurred early in the monocot lineage after its divergence from the eudicot clade.

Visual Prognosis of Eyes Recovering From Macular Hole Surgery Through Automated Quantitative Analysis of Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomography (SD-OCT) Scans. To determine the value of topographic spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging features assessed after macular hole repair surgery in predicting visual acuity (VA) outcomes. An automated algorithm was developed to topographically outline and quantify area, extent, and location of defects in the ellipsoid zone (EZ) band and inner retina layers in SD-OCT scans. We analyzed the correlation of these values with VA in longitudinal observations from 35 patients who underwent successful macular hole surgery, in their first observation after surgery (within 2 months), and in a single observation within 6 to 12 months after surgery. Image features assessed at the first visit after surgery were also investigated as possible predictors of future VA improvement. Significant correlation with longitudinal VA was found for the extent, circularity, and ratio of defects in EZ band at the fovea and parafoveal regions. The ratio of defects in EZ band at the fovea, temporal-inner, and inferior-inner macula regions showed significant strong correlation with VA within 6 to 12 months post surgery. Patients with worse vision outcome at such time also had a significantly higher rate of inner retinal defects in the superior-outer region in their first postsurgery observation. A lowering extent of EZ band defects in the foveal and parafoveal regions is a good indicator of postsurgery VA recovery. Attention should also be given to postsurgical alterations in the inner retina, as patients with more extensive atrophic changes appear to have slower or worse VA recovery despite closure of the macular hole.

Sensitive impedimetric DNA biosensor with poly(amidoamine) dendrimer covalently attached onto carbon nanotube electronic transducers as the tether for surface confinement of probe DNA. This study demonstrates a new impedimetric DNA biosensor with second-generation poly(amidoamine) dendrimer (G2-PAMAM) covalently functionalized onto multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT) electronic transducers as the tether for surface confinement of probe DNA. G2-PAMAM dendrimer was covalently functionalized onto purified MWNTs and the as-formed G2-PAMAM-functionalized MWNT composite (i.e., G2-PAMAM/MWNT) was used both as the support to confine the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) probe and as the electronic transducer to form the DNA biosensors. Upon the occurrence of hybridization events between surface-confined ssDNA probe with target DNA in solution to form a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) at electrode surface, the negative charge in the electrode/electrolyte interface and, as such, the interfacial charge-transfer resistance of the electrodes towards the Fe(CN)(6)(3-/4-) redox couple were changed. Such a change was used for the impedimetric DNA biosensing. The use of G2-PAMAM dendrimer attached onto MWNT electronic transducer as the tether for probe DNA provides a large number of amino groups to increase the surface binding of probe DNA, results in the increase the sensitivity of the impedimetric biosensor for the target DNA. Under the conditions employed here, the change in the interfacial charge-transfer resistance was linear with the logarithm of the concentration of the target DNA within a concentration range from 0.5 to 500 pM with a detection limit of 0.1 pM (S/N=3). The excellent analytical properties of the impedimetric DNA biosensors developed here substantially makes them potentially useful for practical applications.


Paternal dominance of trans-eQTL influences gene expression patterns in maize hybrids.

Clinical Correlates and Prognostic Significance of Lateralized Periodic Discharges in Patients Without Acute or Progressive Brain Injury: A Case-Control Study. Lateralized periodic discharges (LPDs, also known as periodic lateralized epileptiform discharges) in conjunction with acute brain injuries are known to be associated with worse prognosis but little is known about their importance in absence of such acute injuries. We studied the clinical correlates and outcome of patients with LPDs in the absence of acute or progressive brain injury. This is a case-control study of 74 patients with no acute brain injury undergoing continuous EEG monitoring, half with LPDs and half without, matched for age and etiology of remote brain injury, if any, or history of epilepsy. Lateralized periodic discharges were found in 145/1785 (8.1%) of subjects; 37/145 (26%) had no radiologic evidence of acute or progressive brain injury. Those with LPDs were more likely to have abnormal consciousness (86% vs. 57%; P = 0.005), seizures (70% vs. 24%; P = 0.0002), and functional decline (62% vs. 27%; P = 0.005), and were less likely to be discharged home (24% vs. 62%; P = 0.002). On multivariate analysis, LPDs and status epilepticus were associated with abnormal consciousness (P = 0.009; odds ratio = 5.2, 95% CI = 1.60-20.00 and P = 0.017; odds ratio = 5.0, 95% CI = 1.4-21.4); and LPDs were independently associated with functional decline (P = 0.001; odds ratio = 4.8, 95% CI = 1.6-15.4) and lower likelihood of being discharged home (P = 0.009; odds ratio = 0.2, 95% CI = 0.04-0.6). Despite absence of acute or progressive brain injury, LPDs were independently associated with abnormal consciousness and worse outcome at hospital discharge.

ATP stimulates pannexin 1 internalization to endosomal compartments. The ubiquitous pannexin 1 (Panx1) ion- and metabolite-permeable channel mediates the release of ATP, a potent signalling molecule. In the present study, we provide striking evidence that ATP, in turn, stimulates internalization of Panx1 to intracellular membranes. These findings hold important implications for understanding the regulation of Panx1 when extracellular ATP is elevated. In the nervous system, this includes phenomena such as synaptic plasticity, pain, precursor cell development and stroke; outside of the nervous system, this includes things like skeletal and smooth muscle activity and inflammation. Within 15 min, ATP led to significant Panx1-EGFP internalization. In a series of experiments, we determined that hydrolysable ATP is the most potent stimulator of Panx1 internalization. We identified two possible mechanisms for Panx1 internalization, including activation of ionotropic purinergic (P2X) receptors and involvement of a putative ATP-sensitive residue in the first extracellular loop of Panx1 (Trp(74)). Internalization was cholesterol-dependent, but clathrin, caveolin and dynamin independent. Detailed analysis of Panx1 at specific endosome sub-compartments confirmed that Panx1 is expressed in endosome membranes of the classical degradation pathway under basal conditions and that elevation of ATP levels diverts a sub-population to recycling endosomes. This is the first report detailing endosome localization of Panx1 under basal conditions and the potential for ATP regulation of its surface expression. Given the ubiquitous expression profile of Panx1 and the importance of ATP signalling, these findings are of critical importance for understanding the role of Panx1 in health and disease.

Universal external carotid artery to proximal middle cerebral artery bypass with interposed radial artery graft prior to approaching ruptured blood blister-like aneurysm of the internal carotid artery.

Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome: diagnosis and management. Birt-Hogg-DubÃ© syndrome (BHD) is an autosomal dominant condition characterised clinically by skin fibrofolliculomas, pulmonary cysts, spontaneous pneumothorax, and renal cancer. The condition is caused by germline mutations in the FLCN gene, which encodes folliculin; the function of this protein is largely unknown, although FLCN has been linked to the mTOR pathway. The availability of DNA-based diagnosis has allowed insight into the great variation in expression of FLCN, both within and between families. Patients can present with skin signs and also with pneumothorax or renal cancer. Preventive measures are aimed mainly at early diagnosis and treatment of renal cancer. This Review gives an overview of current diagnosis and management of BHD.

Glomerular and proximal tubule cysts as early manifestations of Pkd1 deletion. The homozygous deletion of Pkd1 in the mouse results in embryonic lethality with renal cysts and hydrops fetalis, but there is no precise data on the segmental origin of cysts and potential changes associated with polyhydramnios. We used Pkd1-null mice to investigate cystogenesis and analyze the amniotic fluid composition from embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) to birth (n = 257 embryos). Polyhydramnios was consistently observed from E13.5 in Pkd1(-/-) embryos, in absence of placental abnormalities but with a significantly higher excretion of sodium and glucose from E13.5 through E16.5, and increased cyclic adenosine 3'5-monophosphate (cAMP) levels at E14.5 and E15.5. The Pkd1(-/-) embryos started to die at E13.5, with lethality peaking at E15.5, corresponding to the onset of cystogenesis. The first cysts in Pkd1(-/-) kidneys emerged at E15.5 in mesenchyme-derived segments at the cortico-medullary junction, with a majority of glomerular cysts and fewer proximal tubule cysts (positive for megalin). The cysts extended to ureteric bud-derived collecting ducts (positive for Dolichos biflorus agglutinin lectin) from E16.5. These studies indicate that Pkd1 deletion is associated with a massive loss of solutes (from E13.5) and increased cAMP levels (E14.5) associated with polyhydramnios. These abnormalities precede renal cysts (E15.5), first derived from glomeruli and proximal tubules and later from the collecting ducts, reflecting the expression pattern of Pkd1 in maturing epithelial cells.


Intrastriatal grafts of mesenchymal stem cells in adult intact rats can elevate tyrosine hydroxylase expression and dopamine levels.


Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: Arthroscopic Management for Extreme Soft-Tissue Hip Instability.

Powerful protective role of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol-elenolic acid dialdehyde against erythrocyte oxidative-induced hemolysis. The present work studied and compared the capacity of four important olive oil polyphenolic compounds, oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, and the oleuropein aglycones 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol-elenolic acid (3,4-DHPEA-EA) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol-elenolic acid dialdehyde (3,4-DHPEA-EDA), to protect red blood cells (RBCs) from oxidative hemolysis induced by the physiological initiator H2O2. The amount of hemolysis was evaluated spectrophotometrically. The compounds were also tested in the presence and absence of the naturally occurring antioxidant ascorbic acid. All compounds were revealed to significantly protect RBCs from oxidative hemolysis induced by H2O2 at 40 and 80 microM, with the order of activity being 3,4-DHPEA-EDA>3,4-DHPEA-EA>hydroxytyrosol=oleuropein. At 20, 10, and 5 microM, only 3,4-DHPEA-EDA showed a significant protection against the oxidative injury. In the presence of ascorbic acid at physiological concentration, the addition of individual compounds at 40 microM increased the stability of erythrocytes. The addition of phenolic compounds at 20 and 10 microM did not produce further protection when compared with the protection given by ascorbic acid alone, except for 3,4-DHPEA-EDA. This compound was shown to produce further protection even at 5 microM. In summary, 3,4-DHPEA-EDA plays an important protective role against reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative injury in RBCs, and this effect is more potent than the one evidenced by hydroxytyrosol or oleuropein.


Relationship of polar bodies morphology to embryo quality and pregnancy outcome.

Maternal EPHX1 polymorphisms and risk of phenytoin-induced congenital malformations. The teratogenic effects of the anti-epileptic drug phenytoin have been linked to genetic differences in phenytoin disposition. The goal of this study was to assess the effect of maternal genotype of functional polymorphisms in two genes involved in phenytoin metabolism, CYP2C9 (R144C, I395L) and EPHX1 (Y113H, H139R), on the presence of major craniofacial abnormalities (CFAs) in the child. We used data from the Collaborative Perinatal Project (1959-1974), a study involving 42 000 mothers and 55 000 children to assess the effect of maternal genotype. We studied 174 pregnancies in 155 women who used phenytoin throughout their pregnancy, gave birth to a live child and had available stored blood specimens suitable for DNA extraction. Nineteen children had CFA. In a logistic regression model adjusted for history of phenytoin use during the first trimester and maternal epilepsy (N=157 pregnancies), the maternal EPHX1 113 H [per rare allele odds ratio (OR): 2.43, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.16-5.10, P=0.02] and 139 R (per rare allele OR: 2.33, 95% CI: 1.09-5.00, P=0.03) alleles were associated with CFAs in the child. The maternal EPHX1 Y113/H139 (common) haplotype showed a significant protective association with CFAs in the child (OR: 0.29, 95% CI: 0.12-0.68, P=0.004), when compared to other haplotypes. CYP2C9 genotype was not related to fetal endpoints. Maternal EPHX1 genotype may be associated with risk of fetal anomalies among pregnant women taking phenytoin. Future study is required to confirm these results in larger, independent populations.

Stress Responses of Small Heat Shock Protein Genes in Lepidoptera Point to Limited Conservation of Function across Phylogeny. The small heat shock protein (sHsp) family is thought to play an important role in protein refolding and signal transduction, and thereby protect organisms from stress. However little is known about sHsp function and conservation across phylogenies. In the current study, we provide a comprehensive assessment of small Hsp genes and their stress responses in the oriental fruit moth (OFM), Grapholita molesta. Fourteen small heat shock proteins of OFM clustered with related Hsps in other Lepidoptera despite a high level of variability among them, and in contrast to the highly conserved Hsp11.1. The only known lepidopteran sHsp ortholog (Hsp21.3) was consistently unaffected under thermal stress in Lepidoptera where it has been characterized. However the phylogenetic position of the sHsps within the Lepidoptera was not associated with conservation of induction patterns under thermal extremes or diapause. These findings suggest that the sHsps have evolved rapidly to develop new functions within the Lepidoptera.


TNF receptor 2, not TNF receptor 1, enhances mesenchymal stem cell-mediated cardiac protection following acute ischemia.

Risk Stratification Model for Resected Squamous-Cell Lung Cancer Patients According to Clinical and Pathological Factors. The aim of this analysis (AIRC-MFAG project no. 14282) was to define a risk classification for resected squamous-cell lung cancer based on the combination of clinicopathological predictors to provide a practical tool to evaluate patients' prognosis. Clinicopathological data were retrospectively correlated to disease-free/cancer-specific/overall survival (DFS/CSS/OS) using a Cox model. Individual patient probability was estimated by logistic equation. A continuous score to identify risk classes was derived according to model ratios and dichotomized according to prognosis with receiver operating characteristic analysis. Data from 573 patients from five institutions were gathered. Four hundred ninety-four patients were evaluable for clinical analysis (median age: 68 years; male/female: 403/91; T-descriptor according to TNM 7th edition 1-2/3-4: 330/164; nodes 0/>0: 339/155; stages I and II/III and IV: 357/137). At multivariate analysis, age, T-descriptor according to TNM 7th edition, nodes, and grading were independent predictors for DFS and OS; the same factors, except age and grading, predicted CSS. Multivariate model predict individual patient probability with high prognostic accuracy (0.67 for DFS). On the basis of receiver operating characteristic-derived cutoff, a two-class model significantly differentiated low-risk and high-risk patients for 3-year DFS (64.6% and 32.4%, p < 0.0001), CSS (84.4% and 44.5%, p < 0.0001), and OS (77.3% and 38.8%, p < 0.0001). A three-class model separated low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk patients for 3-year DFS (64.6%, 39.8%, and 21.8%, p < 0.0001), CSS (84.4%, 55.4%, and 30.9%, p< 0.0001), and OS (77.3%, 47.9%, and 27.2%, p < 0.0001). A risk stratification model including often adopted clinicopathological parameters accurately separates resected squamous-cell lung cancer patients into different risk classes. The project is currently ongoing to integrate the clinicopathological model with investigational molecular predictors.

The level of vitamin D in the serum correlates with fatty degeneration of the muscles of the rotator cuff. This study examined the role of vitamin D as a factor accounting for fatty degeneration and muscle function in the rotator cuff. There were 366 patients with disorders of the shoulder. A total of 228 patients had a full-thickness tear (group 1) and 138 patients had no tear (group 2). All underwent magnetic resonance arthrography and an isokinetic muscle performance test. The serum concentrations of vitamin D (25(OH)D(3)) were measured. In general, a lower serum level of vitamin D was related to higher fatty degeneration in the muscles of the cuff. Spearman's correlation coefficients were 0.173 (p = 0.001), -0.181 (p = 0.001), and -0.117 (p = 0.026) for supraspinatus, infraspinatus and subscapularis, respectively. In group 1, multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that the serum level of vitamin D was an independent variable for fatty degeneration of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus. The serum vitamin D level has a significant negative correlation with the fatty degeneration of the cuff muscle and a positive correlation with isokinetic muscle torque.

v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene mutation status in serous borderline ovarian tumors and the effect on clinical behavior. To determine the incidence of activating v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene (BRAF) mutations in 30 serous borderline tumors (SBTs) of the ovary and the accompanying implants and to link BRAF mutation status to the clinical behavior of these tumors. Serous borderline tumors and noninvasive implants of 30 patients were analyzed for the presence of the BRAF V599E mutation, and mutation status was correlated to 70 months of clinical follow-up. Mutation status could be assessed in 27 SBTs. Eleven (41%) showed a BRAF mulation. Four (80%) of 5 patients with bilateral SBT showed a BRAF mutation in both ovaries. From the 8 implants that were analyzed for BRAF, 2 (25%) were mutated together with their primary tumor. v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene mutation positive SBTs tend to present with a lower International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage and a higher tumor volume and are less frequently aneuploid. Seventy months' follow-up indicated no significant recurrence-free survival difference between these groups. v-Raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene mutations are common in ovarian SBT, are strongly associated with bilateral tumors, and are also found in implants. A larger number of tumors should be investigated to assess clinical importance of BRAF mutation status in SBTs.


No evidence for long-term effectiveness of early osteodistraction in hemifacial microsomia.

Low-frequency germline variants across 6p22.2-6p21.33 are associated with non-obstructive azoospermia in Han Chinese men. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several common loci contributing to non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). However, a substantial fraction of NOA heritability remains undefined, especially those low-frequency [defined here as having a minor allele frequency (MAF) between 0.5 and 5%] and rare (MAF below 0.5%) variants. Here, we performed a 3-stage exome-wide association study in Han Chinese men to evaluate the role of low-frequency or rare germline variants in NOA development. The discovery stage included 962 NOA cases and 1348 healthy male controls genotyped by exome chips and was followed by a 2-stage replication with an additional 2168 cases and 5248 controls. We identified three low-frequency variants located at 6p22.2 (rs2298090 in HIST1H1E encoding p.Lys152Arg: OR = 0.30, P = 2.40 Ã 10(-16)) and 6p21.33 (rs200847762 in FKBPL encoding p.Pro137Leu: OR = 0.11, P = 3.77 Ã 10(-16); rs11754464 in MSH5: OR = 1.78, P = 3.71 Ã 10(-7)) associated with NOA risk after Bonferroni correction. In summary, we report an instance of newly identified signals for NOA risk in genes previously undetected through GWAS on 6p22.2-6p21.33 in a Chinese population and highlight the role of low-frequency variants with a large effect in the process of spermatogenesis.

The circle before willis: a historical account of the intracranial anastomosis. The circle of Willis is one of the most famous eponymous structures in human anatomy. There is no doubt Thomas Willis at Oxford accurately demonstrated the anastomotic arterial supply at the base of the brain. However, this eponymous name does not reveal the history of the discovery of the ramification, nor does it give credit to the anatomists and artists who have contributed to the understanding of this clinically important structure. This article first traces the story of the discovery of the circle of Willis. Willis' contribution and innovative approaches are then discussed. Finally, despite Willis' not being the first to describe the circle, we explain why he still deserves to retain the eponymous title. The earlier description of the vasculature at the base of the brain was fixated on a nonexistent structure, at least not in humans, named the rete mirabile. The more scientific study of the blood supply to the brain took place during the Renaissance period, which culminated in the work of Thomas Willis in the 17th century.


A public image database to support research in computer aided diagnosis.

Mutations in Sensor 1 and Walker B in the bovine papillomavirus E1 initiator protein mimic the nucleotide-bound state. Viral replication initiator proteins are multifunctional proteins that utilize ATP binding and hydrolysis by their AAA+ modules for multiple functions in the replication of their viral genomes. These proteins are therefore of particular interest for understanding how AAA+ proteins carry out multiple ATP driven functions. We have performed a comprehensive mutational analysis of the residues involved in ATP binding and hydrolysis in the papillomavirus E1 initiator protein based on the recent structural data. Ten of the eleven residues that were targeted were defective for ATP hydrolysis, and seven of these were also defective for ATP binding. The three mutants that could still bind nucleotide represent the Walker B motif (D478 and D479) and Sensor 1 (N523), three residues that are in close proximity to each other and generally are considered to be involved in ATP hydrolysis. Surprisingly, however, two of these mutants, D478A and N523A, mimicked the nucleotide bound state and were capable of binding DNA in the absence of nucleotide. However, these mutants could not form the E1 double trimer in the absence of nucleotide, demonstrating that there are two qualitatively different consequences of ATP binding by E1, one that can be mimicked by D478A and N523A and one which cannot.


Severe liver failure due to influenza A infection in a hemodialysis patient.

2,2,2-trichloroethanol activates a nonclassical potassium channel in cerebrovascular smooth muscle and dilates the middle cerebral artery. Trichloroacetaldehyde monohydrate [chloral hydrate (CH)] is a sedative/hypnotic that increases cerebral blood flow (CBF), and its active metabolite 2,2,2-trichloroethanol (TCE) is an agonist for the nonclassical two-pore domain K(+) (K(2P)) channels TREK-1 and TRAAK. We sought to determine whether TCE dilates cerebral arteries in vitro by activating nonclassical K(+) channels. TCE dilated pressurized and perfused rat middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) in a manner consistent with activation of nonclassical K(+) channels. Dilation to TCE was inhibited by elevated external K(+) but not by an inhibitory cocktail (IC) of classical K(+) channel blockers. Patch-clamp electrophysiology revealed that, in the presence of the IC, TCE increased whole-cell currents and hyperpolarized the membrane potential of isolated MCA smooth muscle cells. Heating increased TCE-sensitive currents, indicating that the activated channel was thermosensitive. Immunofluorescence in sections of the rat MCA demonstrated that, like TREK-1, TRAAK is expressed in the smooth muscle of cerebral arteries. Isoflurane did not, however, dilate the MCA, suggesting that TREK-1 was not functional. These data indicate that TCE activated a nonclassical K(+) channel with the characteristics of TRAAK in rat MCA smooth-muscle cells. Stimulation of K(+) channels such as TRAAK in cerebral arteries may therefore explain in part how CH/TCE increases CBF.

Undifferentiated carcinoma of nasopharyngeal type (UCNT): a Swiss single-institutional experience during 1990-2005. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a rare tumor entity in Switzerland. In contrast, it is endemic in Asian and African countries. Retrospective studies have been conducted in order to identify risk factors and prognostic determinants of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Nonetheless, these trials were mostly conducted in regions with high prevalence for the disease and little is known about the risk factors and prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma for a non-endemic population in Western Europe. This retrospective trial was conducted to identify risk factors and prognostic determinants of nasopharyngeal carcinoma for a non-endemic population in Switzerland. Overall survival was 91%, 77% and 58% for one, three and five years, respectively. Factors with favourable prognostic value were concomitant radiochemotherapy regimens, photon radiotherapy, and a delay between diagnosis and first therapy session of less than ten weeks, respectively. Factors with unfavourable prognostic values were age over 65 years at time of diagnosis and nasopharyngeal carcinoma of WHO type I. Risk factors, biological behaviour and survival are well comparable between endemic and non-endemic populations for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Nonetheless, an aggressive diagnostic procedure and sophisticated interdisciplinary therapy are indispensable in order to achieve favourable outcome. Therefore, diagnosis and therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in non-endemic populations should be limited to highly specialized tertiary centres.

Inhibiting MDM2-p53 Interaction Suppresses Tumor Growth in Patient-Derived Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Xenograft Models. The tumor suppressor p53 is frequently inactivated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Activation of the p53 pathway by inhibition of its negative regulator MDM2 may offer an attractive approach for NSCLC therapy. We evaluated the antitumor activity of the small-molecule MDM2 inhibitor RG7388 in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of NSCLC. We investigated the effect of RG7388 treatment on cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis using a panel of human NSCLC cell lines (A549, H157, H1650, H1395, and H358) and PDX cell lines (human lung cell lines 12, 137, 277, and 196). PDX-bearing mice were used to test the therapeutic efficacy and pharmacodynamic effects of RG7388 treatment. We demonstrated that RG7388 promotes low nanomolar antiproliferative activity selectively in cell lines with wild-type p53 and p53 pathway activation, resulting in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In PDX models, oral administration of RG7388 led to potent dose-dependent and time-dependent activation of p53 and had a significant impact on p53 downstream targets. Daily treatment of RG7388 in mice at 50 and 80âmg/kg/day inhibited tumor growth in three wild-type p53 PDX models. Activation of the p53 pathway inhibited cell proliferation as observed by reduced Ki-67-positive cells in xenograft tumors. However, induction of apoptotic caspase activity was not observed in these tumors. Notably, RG7388 treatment remains effective in tumors lacking MDM2 amplification but expressing wild-type p53. MDM2 small-molecule inhibitor is effective in treating NSCLC tumors with wild-type p53, supporting further clinical investigation as a potential NSCLC therapy.

Comparison of conductance to volume equations: the gain coefficient alpha. The conductance catheter technique is used to measure real-time pressure and volume data in a beating heart. There are three competing equations for transforming the raw conductance signal into volume: (1) Baan's equation, (2) The cuvette equation (i.e. Relative Volume Units), and (3) Wei's equation. This paper explores the accuracy of these three equations compared to ultrasound echo in mice, and discusses the reason for discrepancy regarding both Baan's equation and the cuvette equation. We conclude that Wei's equation is the most accurate, because its nonlinear mapping yields volumes in the range of physiologic norms.

Antiplatelets and stroke outcomes: state of the science. This article reviews the current use of antiplatelet medications in secondary stroke prevention and in acute stroke treatment. Antiplatelet medications prevent emboli and thrombus formation to avert further vascular occlusion and ischemia. Aspirin, clopidogrel (Plavix), and extended release aspirin/dipyridamole (Aggrenox) represent the mainstay of secondary prevention of ischemic and transient ischemic stroke. Although antiplatelet medications prevent platelet aggregation by different mechanisms, the end result is a significantly decreased risk of secondary stroke, myocardial infarction, and death. Increasingly, the literature reflects hypotheses about the potential utility of aspirin and clopidogrel antiplatelet therapy as a preventative measure in patients at risk of stroke and as an approach to treat embolic ischemic stroke in the acute phase once it has occurred.

Anthrax Pathogenesis. Anthrax is caused by the spore-forming, gram-positive bacterium Bacillus anthracis. The bacterium's major virulence factors are (a) the anthrax toxins and (b) an antiphagocytic polyglutamic capsule. These are encoded by two large plasmids, the former by pXO1 and the latter by pXO2. The expression of both is controlled by the bicarbonate-responsive transcriptional regulator, AtxA. The anthrax toxins are three polypeptides-protective antigen (PA), lethal factor (LF), and edema factor (EF)-that come together in binary combinations to form lethal toxin and edema toxin. PA binds to cellular receptors to translocate LF (a protease) and EF (an adenylate cyclase) into cells. The toxins alter cell signaling pathways in the host to interfere with innate immune responses in early stages of infection and to induce vascular collapse at late stages. This review focuses on the role of anthrax toxins in pathogenesis. Other virulence determinants, as well as vaccines and therapeutics, are briefly discussed. 

Chronic heart failure patients with high collagen type I degradation marker levels benefit more with ACE-inhibitor therapy. Not all patients respond to angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor equally. Genetic or other phenotypic variations might be useful in predicting the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs. With the present study we assessed the prognostic impact of ACE-inhibitor in chronic heart failure patients with different degrees of collagen metabolism as assessed by serum levels of a collagen type I degradation marker (CITP). One hundred ninety-six (126 male, 69+/-10 years) chronic heart failure patients were studied prospectively for 12 months regarding survival. Serum concentrations of CITP were measured at study entry. Chronic heart failure patients were divided into groups according to whether (n=114) or not (n=82) they received ACE-inhibitor as well as to their CITP levels. Survival (52.2%) was significantly lower in ACE-inhibitor naive patients with high CITP levels compared to ACE-inhibitor naive patients with low CITP levels (83.3%, P=0.003), to ACE-inhibitor users with low CITP levels (80%, P=0.006) and to ACE-inhibitor users with high CITP levels (70.4%, P=0.015). ACE-inhibitor related improvement in mortality was most predominant in chronic heart failure patients with high CITP levels. CITP levels possibly reflecting an activated status of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, may be of clinical relevance since they identify a subgroup of patients that is more susceptible to treatment with an ACE-inhibitor.

Protein O-glycosylation induces collagen expression and contributes to diabetic cardiomyopathy in rat cardiac fibroblasts. Diabetic cardiomyopathy may be accompanied by myocardial fibrosis. We have previously reported that cardiac fibrosis and protein O-glycosylation are elevated in diabetes. In this study, we examined if the hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) was involved with collagen expression in rat cardiac fibroblasts (RCFs). Long-term glucose load significantly increased type III collagen expression in RCFs, but did not affect the protein O-glycosylation. In addition, glucosamine treatment not only induced expressions of collagen types I and III, but also increased the O-glycosylated protein. These results suggest that O-glycosylation of protein induced by HBP activation modifies collagen expression and contributes to diabetic cardiomyopathy.

Stress response in tardigrades: differential gene expression of molecular chaperones. Semi-terrestrial tardigrades exhibit a remarkable tolerance to desiccation by entering a state called anhydrobiosis. In this state, they show a strong resistance against several kinds of physical extremes. Because of the probable importance of stress proteins during the phases of dehydration and rehydration, the relative abundance of transcripts coding for two alpha-crystallin heat-shock proteins (Mt-sHsp17.2 and Mt-sHsp19.5), as well for the heat-shock proteins Mt-sHsp10, Mt-Hsp60, Mt-Hsp70 and Mt-Hsp90, were analysed in active and anhydrobiotic tardigrades of the species Milnesium tardigradum. They were also analysed in the transitional stage (I) of dehydration, the transitional stage (II) of rehydration and in heat-shocked specimens. A variable pattern of expression was detected, with most candidates being downregulated. Gene transcripts of one Mt-hsp70 isoform in the transitional stage I and Mt-hsp90 in the anhydrobiotic stage were significantly upregulated. A high gene expression (778.6-fold) was found for the small alpha-crystallin heat-shock protein gene Mt-sHsp17.2 after heat shock. We discuss the limited role of the stress-gene expression in the transitional stages between the active and anhydrobiotic tardigrades and other mechanisms which allow tardigrades to survive desiccation.

Paraplegia caused by intratumoral hemorrhage within thoracic epidural granuloma.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of intravenous adult human mesenchymal stem cells (prochymal) after acute myocardial infarction. Our aim was to investigate the safety and efficacy of intravenous allogeneic human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) in patients with myocardial infarction (MI). Bone marrow-derived hMSCs may ameliorate consequences of MI, and have the advantages of preparation ease, allogeneic use due to immunoprivilege, capacity to home to injured tissue, and extensive pre-clinical support. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging (0.5, 1.6, and 5 million cells/kg) safety trial of intravenous allogeneic hMSCs (Prochymal, Osiris Therapeutics, Inc., Baltimore, Maryland) in reperfused MI patients (n=53). The primary end point was incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events within 6 months. Ejection fraction and left ventricular volumes determined by echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging were exploratory efficacy end points. Adverse event rates were similar between the hMSC-treated (5.3 per patient) and placebo-treated (7.0 per patient) groups, and renal, hepatic, and hematologic laboratory indexes were not different. Ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring demonstrated reduced ventricular tachycardia episodes (p=0.025), and pulmonary function testing demonstrated improved forced expiratory volume in 1 s (p=0.003) in the hMSC-treated patients. Global symptom score in all patients (p=0.027) and ejection fraction in the important subset of anterior MI patients were both significantly better in hMSCs versus placebo subjects. In the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging substudy, hMSC treatment, but not placebo, increased left ventricular ejection fraction and led to reverse remodeling. Intravenous allogeneic hMSCs are safe in patients after acute MI. This trial provides pivotal safety and provisional efficacy data for an allogeneic bone marrow-derived stem cell in post-infarction patients.

SoundView: an auditory guidance system based on environment understanding for the visually impaired people. Without visual information, the blind people live in various hardships with shopping, reading, finding objects and etc. Therefore, we developed a portable auditory guide system, called SoundView, for visually impaired people. This prototype system consists of a mini-CCD camera, a digital signal processing unit and an earphone, working with built-in customizable auditory coding algorithms. Employing environment understanding techniques, SoundView processes the images from a camera and detects objects tagged with barcodes. The recognized objects in the environment are then encoded into stereo speech signals for the blind though an earphone. The user would be able to recognize the type, motion state and location of the interested objects with the help of SoundView. Compared with other visual assistant techniques, SoundView is object-oriented and has the advantages of cheap cost, smaller size, light weight, low power consumption and easy customization.

[On the modified process of human hemoglobin based blood substitutes]. Purified hemoglobin was modified with pyridoxal 5-phosphate(PLP) and polymerized with glutaric dialdehyde(GDA) to get the products. By comparison of the physical, chemical and biological properties of different procedures for modification before and after polymerization, there is no significant difference in molecular distribution, methemoglobin(MetHb) concentration, oxygen carrier capacity, P50 and spectra. Furthermore, the procedure of modification after polymerization can save PLP greatly and decrease cost greatly. So the procedure of modification after polymerization is a better way in research and production. The addition of GDA could control the increasing of MetHb. By comparison on the physical, chemical and biological properties of different procedures, there is no significant difference in molecular distribution, MetHb concentration, oxygen carrier capacity and spectra between the procedure of adding GDA before PLP and that after PLP. But the P50 of adding GDA before PLP is much lower than that after PLP. So the procedure of adding GDA after PLP is a better way.

Predictors of survival in patients with locally advanced thymoma and thymic carcinoma (Masaoka stages III and IVa). We sought to evaluate factors influencing long-term survival of patients with locally advanced thymoma/thymic carcinoma (Masaoka stages III and IVa) treated by immediate surgery or induction therapy plus surgery. From January 1991 to April 2007, we surgically treated 61 patients with locally advanced thymoma/thymic carcinoma (Masaoka stages III and IVa). Staging included total body computed tomography (CT) scan in all patients, and chest magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 27 selected patients. All patients had histological confirmation before surgery. Thirty-one patients (group A) underwent induction chemotherapy followed by surgery. Thirty patients (group B) underwent immediate surgery. Thirty-four patients (group A: 13; group B: 17) received postoperative radiation therapy. No intra-operative mortality was reported. World Health Organization (WHO) histological classification included 19 AB, four B1, seven B2 and 13 B3 thymomas and 18 thymic carcinomas. Thirty-four patients were Masaoka stage III (group A: 18; group B: 16) and 27 patients were stage IVa (group A: 13; group B: 14). After a median follow-up of 77 months, six patients of group A and seven patients of group B died of disease. The overall 10-year survival rate was 50.6%. The 10-year survival rate was 57.9% in group A and 38.1% in group B (p=0.03). Multivariate analysis showed complete resection (p=0.02), Masaoka stage (III vs IVa) (p=0.02), induction chemotherapy (group A vs group B) (p=0.003) and histological WHO subtype (AB vs B1, B2 and B3) (p=0.01) to be statistically significant independent predictors of survival. Sex, age and adjuvant radiation therapy showed no statistically significant difference. Complete resection, Masaoka stage, induction chemotherapy and histological WHO classification showed to be independent predictors of survival in locally advanced thymoma/thymic carcinoma.

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate increases maximal oxygen uptake in adult humans. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a component of green tea, increases endurance performance in animals and promotes fat oxidation during cycle ergometer exercise in adult humans. We have investigated the hypothesis that short-term consumption of EGCG delays the onset of the ventilatory threshold (VT) and increases maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max). In this randomized, repeated-measures, double-blind study, 19 healthy adults (11 males and 8 females, age = 26 Â± 2 yr (mean Â± SE)) received seven placebo or seven EGCG (135-mg) pills. Forty-eight hours before data collection, participants began consuming three pills per day; the last pill was taken 2 h before exercise testing. VT and VO2max were determined from breath-by-breath indirect calorimetry data collected during continuous incremental stationary cycle ergometer exercise (20-35 WÂ·min(-1)), from rest until volitional fatigue. Each condition/exercise test was separated by a minimum of 14 d. Compared with placebo, short-term EGCG consumption increased VO2max (3.123 Â± 0.187 vs 3.259 Â± 0.196 LÂ·min(-1), P = 0.04). Maximal work rate (301 Â± 15 vs 301 Â± 16 W, P = 0.98), maximal RER (1.21 Â± 0.01 vs 1.22 Â± 0.02, P = 0.27), and maximal HR were unaffected (180 Â± 3 vs 180 Â± 3 beatsÂ·min(-1), P = 0.87). In a subset of subjects (n = 11), maximal cardiac output (determined via open-circuit acetylene breathing) was also unaffected by EGCG (29.6 Â± 2.2 vs 30.2 Â± 1.4 LÂ·min(-1), P = 0.70). Contrary to our hypothesis, EGCG decreased VO2 at VT (1.57 Â± 0.11 vs 1.48 Â± 0.10 LÂ·min(-1)), but this change was not significant (P = 0.06). Short-term consumption of EGCG increased VO2max without affecting maximal cardiac output, suggesting that EGCG may increase arterial-venous oxygen difference.


Cardiac resynchronization therapy utilization for heart failure: findings from IMPROVE HF.

Seasonal variations in frontoethmoidal meningoencephalocele births in Cambodia. Frontoethmoidal meningoencephalocele (fMEC) is relatively common in many Southeast Asian countries, with devastating aesthetic and social consequences for affected children. No cause has been detected to date. Among other factors, the authors of this paper attempt to identify a statistically significant difference in the spread of fMEC births throughout the year compared with other births. This seasonal variation in the incidence of fMEC births may provide clues to the causes of this condition. From a group of 175 children with fMEC who underwent surgery at the authors' humanitarian institution (Children's Surgical Centre) in Phnom Penh between 2004 and 2008, 86 children were studied. These children were born at full term and had an accurately recorded date of birth. The birth dates of this fMEC group were compared with a group of > 15,000 other live births at one of the main maternity units in Phnom Penh in 2005 and 2006. Seasonal variation in incidence of fMEC by month of birth was highly statistically significant (p < 0.001), with the peak of births occurring in the dry season (between March and May). This is in contrast to the control group, in which there was an equal distribution of births throughout the year. More than 85% of the parents of children with fMEC who the authors treated were farmers, but this figure reflects the composition of the Cambodian population. Uneven spread in the incidence of fMEC births throughout the year suggests that a seasonal factor during the wet season may be suspected in the pathogenesis of fMEC in Cambodia.

From past to future agricultural expertise in Africa: Jola women of Senegal expand market-gardening. Jola women farmers in the Casamance region of southern Senegal use their "traditional" knowledge and farming skills to shift crop repertoires and techniques so as to embark on market-gardening, thus innovating in response to new needs and perceived opportunities. The argument is relevant to present-day concerns about regional food systems and the role of women in securing an income and providing extra food for the family.

Growth of Belgian and Norwegian children compared to the WHO growth standards: prevalence below -2 and above +2 SD and the effect of breastfeeding. New national growth references have been published in Belgium and Norway. The WHO recommends universal use of their 2006 Child Growth Standards based on data from breastfed children. To compare the growth of Belgian and Norwegian children with the WHO standards. 6985 children 0-5 years of age from Belgium and Norway. Proportion of children below -2 SD and above +2 SD of the WHO standards was calculated for length/height, weight, body mass index and head circumference. Average SD scores of exclusively breastfed children of non-smoking mothers were compared with national reference data and with the WHO standards. Generally, the number of Belgian and Norwegian children below -2 SD lines of the WHO standards was lower and above +2 SD higher than expected. The largest differences were for head circumference (0.97% Belgian and 0.18% Norwegian children below -2 SD, 6.55% Belgian and 6.40% Norwegian children above +2 SD) and the smallest for length/height (1.25% Belgian and 1.43% Norwegian children below -2 SD, 3.47% Belgian and 2.81% Norwegian children above +2 SD). The growth pattern of breastfed children of non-smoking mothers was in both countries more alike the local national growth references than the WHO standards. There are significant deviations in the proportion of children outside normal limits (Â±2 SD) of the WHO standards. This was true for all children, including those who were exclusively breastfed. Hence, adoption of the WHO growth charts could have consequences for clinical decision-making. These findings advocate the use of national references in Belgium and Norway, also for breastfed children.

Has the advent of minimally invasive surgery altered the risk profile of patients undergoing prostatectomy? To determine whether the decreased short-term morbidity associated with minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has resulted in an alteration in the disease-specific risk profile of prostatectomy patients. MIS in many fields has resulted in an expansion in the pool of patients willing to undergo surgery. The Columbia Urologic Oncology Database was queried, and 1751 patients undergoing radical prostatectomy between 2000 and 2007 were identified. The cohort was divided into 2 groups: patients who received surgery before or after the initiation of robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (RALRP) at our institution (from 2003 onward). Age at surgery, Kattan Nomogram (KN) score, prostate-specific antigen (PSA), Gleason score sum, and tumor stage were compared using unpaired t tests with Welch correction and Mann-Whitney tests. A total of 663 patients underwent prostatectomy from 2000 to 2002 ("pre-MIS era"), and 1088 patients had surgery in 2003 or later ("MIS era"), of which 519 and 569 underwent RALRP and open prostatectomy, respectively. There was no significant difference between the 2 eras regarding age, Kattan Nomogram score, or tumor stage. However, there was a significant difference in preoperative PSA (P = .01) and Gleason sum (P = .0002). In a comparison of the pre-MIS era with RALRP patients, only PSA differed significantly (P = .0002). The advent of MIS for prostate cancer did not significantly alter the characteristics of patients undergoing prostatectomy at our institution. Although advancements in surgical techniques may improve clinical outcomes, this study does not suggest a consequential effect on the risk stratification of patients choosing surgery for prostate cancer.

High DNA methyltransferase 3B expression mediates 5-aza-deoxycytidine hypersensitivity in testicular germ cell tumors. Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are the most common solid tumors of 15- to 35-year-old men. TGCT patients are frequently cured with cytotoxic cisplatin-based therapy. However, TGCT patients refractory to cisplatin-based chemotherapy have a poor prognosis, as do those having a late relapse. Pluripotent embryonal carcinomas (EC) are the malignant counterparts to embryonic stem cells and are considered the stem cells of TGCTs. Here, we show that human EC cells are highly sensitive to 5-aza-deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR) compared with somatic solid tumor cells. Decreased proliferation and survival with low nanomolar concentrations of 5-aza-CdR is associated with ATM activation, H2AX phosphorylation, increased expression of p21, and the induction of genes known to be methylated in TGCTs (MGMT, RASSF1A, and HOXA9). Notably, 5-aza-CdR hypersensitivity is associated with markedly abundant expression of the pluripotency-associated DNA methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) compared with somatic tumor cells. Knockdown of DNMT3B in EC cells results in substantial resistance to 5-aza-CdR, strongly indicating that 5-aza-CdR sensitivity is mechanistically linked to high levels of DNMT3B. Intriguingly, cisplatin-resistant EC cells retain an exquisite sensitivity to low-dose 5-aza-CdR treatment, and pretreatment of 5-aza-CdR resensitizes these cells to cisplatin-mediated toxicity. This resensitization is also partially dependent on high DNMT3B levels. These novel findings indicate that high expression of DNMT3B, a likely byproduct of their pluripotency and germ cell origin, sensitizes TGCT-derived EC cells to low-dose 5-aza-CdR treatment.

Rapid cytological diploidization in newly formed allopolyploids of the wheat (Aegilops-Triticum) group. Recent studies in the genera Aegilops and Triticum showed that allopolyploid formation triggers rapid genetic and epigenetic changes that lead to cytological and genetic diploidization. To better understand the consequences of cytological diploidization, chromosome pairing and seed fertility were studied in S1, S2, and S3 generations of 18 newly formed allopolyploids at different ploidy levels. Results showed that bivalent pairing at first meiotic metaphase was enhanced and seed fertility was improved during each successive generation. A positive linear relationship was found between increased bivalent pairing, improved fertility, and elimination of low-copy noncoding DNA sequences. These findings support the conclusion that rapid elimination of low-copy noncoding DNA sequences from one genome of a newly formed allopolyploid, different sequences from different genomes, is an efficient way to quickly augment the divergence between homoeologous chromosomes and thus bring about cytological diploidization. This facilitates the rapid establishment of the raw allopolyploids as successful, competitive species in nature.

The burden of respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis on a pediatric inpatient service. Respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis is the single leading cause of pediatric admissions for infants in the first year of life, presenting regularly in epidemic proportions in the winter months and impacting in major way on pediatric inpatient services. To quantitate the burden of RSV disease on a pediatric service with the purpose of providing a database for proper health planning and resource allocation. We conducted a prospective 5 year study of documented RSV infections in a single pediatric service. RSV disease was confirmed by direct immunofluorescence testing of nasal swabs from all hospitalized cases of bronchiolitis. On average, 147 17 cases of RSV bronchiolitis were admitted annually in the November-March RSV season, representing 7%-9% of admissions and 10%-14% of hospital days. There was a consistent male preponderance of admissions (55-64%) and 15-23% of admissions were patients less than 1 month old. In peak months RSS ses accounted for as many of 40% of the hospitalized infants and was the leading cause of over-occupancy (up to 126%) in the pediatric ward during the winter. RSV infection is a major burden for pediatric inpatient services during the winter season. This recurrent and predictable "epidemic," which regularly leads to over-occupancy, requires increased manpower (nursing) and resources (beds, pulse oximeters) to facilitate proper care. Since this annual event is not a surprise nor an unexpected peak, but rather a cyclical predictable epidemiological phenomeon, proper planning and allocation of services are crucial.

Prevention of hip fractures by exposure to sunlight and pharmacotherapy in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Hypovitaminosis D and K due to malnutrition or sunlight deprivation, compensatory hyperparathyroidism, increased bone resorption, low bone mineral density (BMD), and an increased risk of falls may contribute to an increased risk of hip fractures in patients with Alzheimer's disease. The purpose of the present study was to clarify the efficacy of interventions against hip fractures in patients with Alzheimer's disease. With respect to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding Alzheimer's disease and hip fractures, the literature was searched with PubMed. Three RCTs were identified, and the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for individual RCTs. Exposure to sunlight with calcium supplementation, menatetrenone (vitamin K2) plus calcium and vitamin D supplementation, and risedronate plus calcium and vitamin D supplementation improved hypovitaminosis D and hyperparathyroidism, contributing to a reduction in bone resorption. Risedronate itself strongly decreased bone resorption. Menatetrenone also decreased the serum level of undercarboxylated osteocalcin. The three interventions increased metacarpal BMD and reduced the incidence of hip fractures. The respective RRs (95% CI) were 0.22 (0.049-0.999), 0.13 (0.031-0.554), and 0.26 (0.100- 0.690). The present study clarified the efficacy of three interventions, including exposure to sunlight, menatetrenone, and risedronate with calcium and/or vitamin D supplementation against hip fractures in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Effects of computer monitor-emitted radiation on oxidant/antioxidant balance in cornea and lens from rats. This study aims to investigate the possible effects of computer monitor-emitted radiation on the oxidant/antioxidant balance in corneal and lens tissues and to observe any protective effects of vitamin C (vit C). Four groups (PC monitor, PC monitor plus vitamin C, vitamin C, and control) each consisting of ten Wistar rats were studied. The study lasted for three weeks. Vitamin C was administered in oral doses of 250 mg/kg/day. The computer and computer plus vitamin C groups were exposed to computer monitors while the other groups were not. Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) activities were measured in corneal and lens tissues of the rats. In corneal tissue, MDA levels and CAT activity were found to increase in the computer group compared with the control group. In the computer plus vitamin C group, MDA level, SOD, and GSH-Px activities were higher and CAT activity lower than those in the computer and control groups. Regarding lens tissue, in the computer group, MDA levels and GSH-Px activity were found to increase, as compared to the control and computer plus vitamin C groups, and SOD activity was higher than that of the control group. In the computer plus vitamin C group, SOD activity was found to be higher and CAT activity to be lower than those in the control group. The results of this study suggest that computer-monitor radiation leads to oxidative stress in the corneal and lens tissues, and that vitamin C may prevent oxidative effects in the lens.

Evaluation of medical gestures based on a global performance index. This paper presents a method to evaluate medical gestures. The objective is to objectively assess a gesture carried out by novice doctors. The proposed method is based on the study of the curvature of the 3D gesture and provide a global performance index for one manipulation. The study of the number of peaks on the curvature indicates if the gesture is smooth or not. The application is the obstetric gestures linked to the forceps use but the method can be applied to different gestures without loss of generality. Seven residents carried out 30 forceps blade placements. The results clearly show a difference between the gestures carried out. This highlights the difficulty of the gesture according to the fetal head presentation.

Macrolide-Resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae, United States. Macrolide-resistant Mycoplasma pneumoniae (MRMP) is highly prevalent in Asia and is now being reported from Europe.

Autophagy genes as tumor suppressors.

From electric acoustic stimulation to improved sound coding in cochlear implants. Research into electric acoustic stimulation (EAS) indicates that performance improves when acoustic stimulation is added to electric stimulation in subjects with residual low-frequency acoustic hearing. Research further indicates that information from the voice fundamental frequency (F(0)) region accounts for the majority of the added speech perception benefit with EAS. This implies that improved frequency coding in the low frequencies could hold great potential for improving performance with cochlear implants (CIs). Results with new speech coding strategies such as fine structure processing indeed indicate that with improved low-frequency coding, at least some of the benefits of EAS can be translated to regular CI users.

The relationship between serum uric acid concentration and metabolic syndrome in university freshmen. Serum uric acid (SUA) level is often elevated in participants with metabolic syndrome (MS), and hyperuricemia appears linked inextricably to the presence of MS. Aims of this study included conducting a comparison of SUA concentrations in university students with and without MS and exploring the relationship between hyperuricemia and MS. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 1,096 freshmen students, who received a health examination at a university. Data were collected on demographics, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, and lipid profile. Criteria used in this study for MS and hyperuricemia were those published by the Bureau of Health Promotion, Department of Health, Taiwan, ROC, and in Taiwan's Nutritional and Health Survey. The prevalence of hyperuricemia and MS in all participants was 16.97% and 8.10%, respectively. The prevalence of both was significantly higher in male than in female participants. Covariance analysis showed that SUA levels were significantly higher in participants with MS than in those without,after adjusting for confounding variables. The components of MS increased significantly with increased SUA levels. Participants with hyperuricemia faced a higher risk of MS than did those with normal SUA levels. In terms of MS analysis components, male participants with hyperuricemia faced higher risks of abdominal obesity and hypertension than did their peers with normal SUA concentrations, and female participants with hyperuricemia faced higher risks of abdominal obesity, hypertension, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Hyperuricemia may trigger certain health problems and has been positively related with MS. To improve these concurrent conditions, school nurses should make use of education resources to develop optimal intervention strategies to facilitate effective lifestyle changes in students and reduce the incidence of MS and hyperudicemia.

Automatic identification of various nuclei in the basal ganglia for Parkinson's disease neurosurgery. Stereotactic neurosurgery for Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most used treatments for relief symptoms of this degenerative disorder. Current methods include ablation and deep brain stimulation (DBS) that can be applied to the various nuclei in the basal ganglia (BG), for instance to the Subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the Ventral medial nucleus (Vim). Identification of thus regions must be rigorous and within a minimum position error. Usually, skilled specialist identifies the brain area by comparing and listening to the rhythm created by the temporal and spatial aggregation of action potentials presented in microelectrode recordings (MER). We present a novel system for automatic identification of the various nuclei in the BG which addresses the limitations of the subjectivity and the non-stationary nature of MER signals. This system incorporates the time-frequency analysis using the Hilbert-Huang Transform (HHT), which is a recent tool for processing nonlinear and non-stationary data, with a dynamic classifier based on Hidden Markov Models (HMM). Classification accuracy in two different databases is compared to validate the performance of the proposed method. Results show that system can recognize selected nuclei with a mean accuracy of 90%.

Human AlkB homologue 1 (ABH1) exhibits DNA lyase activity at abasic sites. Bacterial AlkB and three human AlkB homologues (ABH1, ABH2, and ABH3) are Fe(2+)/2-oxoglutarate-dependent oxygenases that directly repair alkylation-damaged DNA. Here, we show that ABH1 unexpectedly has a second activity, cleaving DNA at abasic (AP) sites such as those arising spontaneously from alkylation-dependent depurination reactions. The DNA cleavage activity of ABH1 does not require added Fe(2+) or 2-oxoglutarate, is not inhibited by EDTA, and is unaffected by mutation of the putative metal-binding residues, indicating that this activity arises from an active site distinct from that used for demethylation. AP-specific DNA cleavage was shown to occur by a lyase mechanism, rather than by hydrolysis, with the enzyme remaining associated with the DNA product. ABH1 can cleave at closely spaced AP-sites on opposite DNA strands yielding double-strand breaks in vitro and this reaction may relate to the physiological role of this unexpected AP lyase activity.

Mycophenolate mofetil in children with steroid/cyclophosphamide-resistant nephrotic syndrome. The purpose of this study was to assess the results of therapy with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) who were both steroid- and cyclophosphamide-resistant. Treatment lasted a minimum of 6 months, and follow-up data were collected over a 2-year period. The children were divided into two groups: Group 1 (n=34) comprised patients who had received cyclosporine A (CsA) before the initiation of MMF therapy; Group 2 (n=18) comprised patients who received only MMF. Among the 34 patients of Group 1, complete and partial remission were achieved in seven (20.6%) and 13 patients (38.6%), respectively; there was no response in 14 patients (41.2%). Among the 18 patients in Group 2, complete and partial remission occurred in five (27.8%) and six (33.3%) patients, respectively; there was no response in seven patients (38.9%). Eight patients developed chronic kidney disease. The main side-effects were gastrointestinal complaints (n=11, 21%), recurring severe infections (n=1, 1.9%), and mild thrombocytopenia/leucopenia (n=1, 1.9%). MMF proved to be therapeutically effective in 59.5% of the cases. These beneficial effects need to be confirmed in studies with a long-term follow-up after discontinuation of the treatment. Our statistical analysis of the results of therapy with MMF did not reveal any significant difference between its use alone or following CsA administration.

[Effects of perindopril and spirolactone on plasma aldosterone and left atrial remodeling in a canine model of atrial fibrillation]. To investigate the effects of perindopril and spirolactone on plasma aldosterone (Ald) and left atrial remodeling and function in a canine model of atrial fibrillation (AF). Adult dogs were randomly assigned to receive normal diet (group A), perindopril (group B, 1 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1)) and spironolactone (group C, 10 mgxkg(-1)xd(-1), n = 6 each) and rapid paced (500 beats/min) for 8 weeks. Plasma Ald levels as well as atrial dimension and function at baseline and at 4 and 8 weeks after pacing were measured by RIA and echocardiography, respectively. Incidence of maintained AF and AF duration were recorded when pacing was stopped after 8 weeks of pacing. Left and right atrial tissues were collected for measurements of tissue Ald levels and fibrosis. Plasma Ald was similar among groups at baseline (P > 0.05) and significantly increased post 4 and 8 weeks pacing in group A (P < 0.05) while remained unchanged post pacing in group B and C (P > 0.05) compared to respective baseline level. Atrial Ald was significantly lower in group B and C compared that in group A post 8 weeks pacing (P < 0.05). Left atrial dimension, end-systolic and end-diastolic volume were significantly increased while left atrial ejection fraction (LAEF) was significantly reduced post pacing in group A (all P < 0.05 vs. baseline) and thses changes were significantly attenuated in group B and C (P < 0.05 vs. group A). Incidence of maintained AF and AF duration post pacing as well as interstitial collagen volume fraction were significantly lower in group B and C compared those in group A (P < 0.05). Increased Ald might be an important pathogenesis for AF formation and progression, spironolactone and perindopril could attenuate atrial remodeling and improve atrial function by reducing plasma and tissue Ald levels in this model.

Gelsolin in human colon adenocarcinoma cells with different metastatic potential. Gelsolin, one of a major actin-binding proteins, is involved in the regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization by its severing and capping activity towards actin filaments. Human colon adenocarcinoma cell line LS180 and its selected variants of different metastatic potential were used to check for a correlation between gelsolin level, its subcellular localization and the invasive capacity of cells. Based on immunoblotting experiments, a decreased level of gelsolin was detected in the most invasive 5W subline when compared to the parental cell line LS180. The intracellular distribution of actin filaments and gelsolin in colon adenocarcinoma cells was examined by confocal microscopy. In the 5W subline, unlike in the other examined cells, gelsolin was colocalized with filamentous actin at the cell periphery. In summary, in human colon adenocarcinoma cells, gelsolin level and its subcellular distribution seem to correlate with their metastatic potential.

Self-efficacy as a moderator of the relationship between care recipient memory and behavioral problems and caregiver depression in female dementia caregivers. The purpose of the current study was to explore the moderating effect of 3 domains of caregiver self-efficacy on the relationship between exogenous caregiving stressors (care recipient memory and behavioral problems) and depression. Moderator analyses were used to analyze data for 256 caregivers of elder relatives with dementia recruited at the Palo-Alto site of the National REACH (Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health) Project. Significant interactions between the stressor and self-efficacy indicated a potential moderating effect. Post hoc analyses were then conducted to determine the nature of the interaction(s). Self-efficacy for managing disruptive behaviors and self-efficacy for controlling upsetting thoughts had a direct effect on depression. Self-efficacy for responding to disruptive behaviors moderated the relationship between care recipient memory and behavioral problems and symptoms of depression. Self-efficacy may be an important clinical tool for identifying the caregivers who are most vulnerable to depression. Self-efficacy for responding to disruptive behaviors may be especially helpful in identifying caregivers at the greatest risk for depression when care recipient memory and behavior problems are high.

Whole genome microarray analysis of chicken embryo facial prominences. The face is one of the three regions most frequently affected by congenital defects in humans. To understand the molecular mechanisms involved, it is necessary to have a more complete picture of gene expression in the embryo. Here, we use microarrays to profile expression in chicken facial prominences, post neural crest migration and before differentiation of mesenchymal cells. Chip-wide analysis revealed that maxillary and mandibular prominences had similar expression profiles while the frontonasal mass chips were distinct. Of the 3094 genes that were differentially expressed in one or more regions of the face, a group of 56 genes was subsequently validated with quantitative polymerase chain reaction (QPCR) and a subset examined with in situ hybridization. Microarrays trends were consistent with the QPCR data for the majority of genes (81%). On the basis of QPCR and microarray data, groups of genes that characterize each of the facial prominences can be determined.

Preliminary feasibility study of benzo(a)pyrene oxidative degradation by Fenton treatment. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are considered priority compounds due to their toxic and carcinogenic nature. The concern about water contamination and the consequent human exposure has encouraged the development of new methods for PAHs removal. The purpose of this work was to study the feasibility of a degradation process of benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) in aqueous matrices by oxidation with Fenton reagent. A laboratory unit was designed to optimize the factors which may influence the process: pH (3.5 to 6.0), temperature (30 to 70 degrees C), H(2)O(2) (20 to 150 mg L(-1)), Fe(2+) concentration (2.75 to 5.50 mg L(-1)), and the initial concentration of the pollutant (10 to 100 mug L(-1)). The pH did not influence significantly the results in the range studied. An increase in temperature from 30 to 70 degrees C improved the removal efficiency from 90% to 100%. The same effect was observed for ferrous ion concentrations from 2.75 to 5.50 mg L(-1) (increase from 78% to 100% removal). The H(2)O(2) concentration played a double role during the process: from 20 to 50 mg L(-1) an increase in the removal efficiency was achieved, but for higher concentrations (>50 mg L(-1)) the degradation is lower. This study proved that the degradation of benzo(a)pyrene by Fenton's reagent is a viable process.

An interstitial duplication of chromosome 13q31.3q32.1 further delineates the critical region for postaxial polydactyly type A2. Postaxial polydactyly type A2 (PAP-A2; OMIM 602085) is a common feature seen in patients with a partial duplication of the long arm of chromosome 13. Dose dependency has been shown for digital malformations in this region, deletions resulting in oligodactyly and duplications in polydactyly. We aimed to narrow down the critical region for PAP-A2 in order to identify candidate genes. We performed chromosomal analysis, FISH and array-CGH in a patient with an interstitial duplication of chromosome 13q31.3q32.1 and a mild phenotype including postaxial polydactyly. The duplicated region spanned 5.59 Mb (89.67-95.25 Mb) and contained eleven known genes, including GPC5 and GPC6. GPC5 and GPC6 show homology with GPC3 and GPC4, genes involved in Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome, an overgrowth syndrome in which also polydactyly can occur. Mouse studies have shown expression of both GPC5 and GPC6 in developing limbs. Therefore, we propose that GPC5 and GPC6 are the most likely candidate genes for PAP-A2.

Perception of speech by prelingual pre-adolescent and adolescent cochlear implant users. This study was undertaken to assess the speech perception benefits, 24 months after cochlear implantation (CI), in 20 young people (age at CI, 8-18.5 years) with prelingual profound hearing loss, in addition to the use of a proposed CI candidacy assessment profile. Speech perception was evaluated in terms of word and sentence perception before CI, and at six-monthly intervals for two years after CI. Before undergoing CI, all participants were tested on a pre-implantation assessment profile. Compared to the pre-CI findings, group results over 24 months post-CI demonstrated improved speech perception abilities reaching, on average, 46% for word recognition, 71.3% for sentences in quiet, and 33.6% for sentences in noise. Pre-CI profile scores correlated significantly with all speech perception results obtained 24 months after CI. Thus, despite their relatively late ages at implantation, all participants showed gradually improving performance in speech perception. The results showed a high variability in the outcomes of the participants. The pre-CI profile appeared to be useful in formulating realistic expectations of CI outcome during pre-implantation consultations, suggesting that expectations can and should be managed according to each patient's pre-implantation assessment.

Ion solvation in a water-urea mixture. We employ molecular dynamics simulations and the reference interaction site model (RISM) integral equation theory to study the solvation structure and solvation thermodynamics of the transfer process from water to a water-urea mixture. Simple positive and negative ions together with uncharged species of the same size are used as crude models for the hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups of a protein. We find that urea preferentially solvates positively charged species. The solvation free energies obtained indicate that larger solutes favor the transfer from water to a water-urea mixture. The decomposition of the transfer free energy into the energetic and entropic terms shows that the energetic part is much larger than the entropic one and tends to dominate the transfer process, supporting the direct mechanism of urea-denaturation. In addition, the effect of urea on the water liquid structure is discussed from the viewpoint of solvation entropy.

Laparoscopic heminephrectomy for benign renal anomalies. Benign renal conditions, such as duplication and fusion anomalies, are relatively common and may lead to problems such as chronic flank pain or urinary tract infection. Traditional management of these conditions has been open surgical removal of the affected moiety. As an alternative, we report on our experience with laparoscopic heminephrectomy for benign renal anomalies and emphasize the technical aspects of the procedures. We retrospectively reviewed the records of patients who underwent laparoscopic heminephrectomy for benign renal anomalies at our institution between February 1999 and April 2009. Heminephrectomy was performed in 11 patients, including 8 with duplicated collecting systems, 2 with horseshoe kidneys, and 1 with a cross-fused renal ectopic kidney. Median operative time was 204 minutes, and median estimated blood loss was 250 mL. There were no intraoperative complications. The presenting symptoms resolved in all patients. There were three major and two minor postoperative complications, including 50% loss of remaining ipsilateral renal parenchyma, postoperative neuralgia and anejaculation, urinoma, and partial wound separation. Median length of hospital stay was 2 days. Renal function was well preserved in all patients. The median change in serum creatinine level was 0.1 mg/dL. Although laparoscopic heminephrectomy is challenging because of the variable blood supply and abnormal anatomy of the kidney, with careful planning and attention to detail, the procedure is safe and effective for the management of a wide range of benign renal anomalies that necessitate heminephrectomy and offers the usual recovery advantages of laparoscopy.

Treatment of head lice with dimeticone 4% lotion: comparison of two formulations in a randomised controlled trial in rural Turkey. Dimeticone 4% lotion was shown to be an effective treatment for head louse infestation in two randomised controlled trials in England. It is not affected by insecticide resistance but efficacy obtained (70-75%) was lower than expected. This study was designed to evaluate efficacy of dimeticone 4% lotion in a geographically, socially, and culturally different setting, in rural Turkey and, in order to achieve blinding, it was compared with a potential alternative formulation. Children from two village schools were screened for head lice by detection combing. All infested students and family members could participate, giving access to treatment for the whole community. Two investigator applied treatments were given 7 days apart. Outcome was assessed by detection combing three times between treatments and twice the week following second treatment. In the intention to treat group 35/36 treated using dimeticone 4% had no lice after the second treatment but there were two protocol violators giving 91.7% treatment success. The alternative product gave 30/36 (83.3%) treatment success, a difference of 8.4% (95% CI -9.8% to 26.2%). The cure rates per-protocol were 33/34 (97.1%) and 30/35 (85.7%) respectively. We were unable to find any newly emerged louse nymphs on 77.8% of dimeticone 4% treated participants or on 66.7% of those treated with the alternative formulation. No adverse events were identified. Our results confirm the efficacy of dimeticone 4% lotion against lice and eggs and we found no detectable difference between this product and dimeticone 4% lotion with nerolidol 2% added. We believe that the high cure rate was related to the lower intensity of infestation in Turkey, together with the level of community engagement, compared with previous studies in the UK.

Epidemiology, clinical presentation, treatment and prognosis of a regional series of 26 anaplastic thyroid carcinomas (ATC). Comparison with the literature. The aim of this study is to retrospectively describe the epidemiological and clinical features, therapeutic modalities, prognostic factors and survival figures in a population of patients with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) observed in Auvergne, France. We compared these data with those in the literature. The analysis was conducted based on a computer database containing a regional register recorded by health professionals treating ATC. Of the 1500 cancers observed over 16 years, 26 were identified as ATC. The male/female ratio was 1/2.7 and the average age: 72.1; 76.9% of the cases had thyroid medical history, average tumor size at diagnosis was 7.35 cm with N1 in the course of illness in 61.5% of cases, M1 in 34.6% of cases. Surgery was performed in 84.6% of cases, radiotherapy in 53.8% and chemotherapy in 19.2%. The average survival was 9 months, the survival median: 4 months. Our results show that, in univariate analysis, age above 75, capsular invasion, lymph nodes metastasis, tumor residue after surgery and lack of multimodal treatment (particularly radiotherapy in patients without tumor residue) are factors of poor prognosis. In a multivariate analysis only age above 75, followed by node invasion, capsular invasion, and finally female gender are factors of poor prognosis.

Ultrasound assessment of the displacement and deformation of the median nerve in the human carpal tunnel with active finger motion. Peripheral nerves are mobile structures, stretching and translating in response to changes in the position of adjuvant anatomic structures. The objective of this study was to develop a novel method to characterize the relative motion and deformation of the median nerve on cross-sectional ultrasound images of the carpal tunnel during active finger motion. Fifteen volunteers without a history of carpal tunnel syndrome or wrist trauma were recruited. An ultrasound scanner and a linear array transducer were used to evaluate the motion of the median nerve and the flexor tendons within the carpal tunnel during motion from full extension to full flexion by the four fingers (fist motion) and by the long finger alone. The displacement of the median nerve relative to the long-finger flexor digitorum superficialis tendon as well as the perimeter, cross-sectional area, circularity, and aspect ratio of a minimum enclosing rectangle of the median nerve were measured. The data were compared between single-digit motion and fist motion and between extension and flexion positions. The distance between the long-finger flexor digitorum superficialis tendon and the median nerve with isolated long-finger flexion was decreased in the ulnar-radial direction and increased in the palmar-dorsal direction as compared with the distance with four-finger flexion (p < 0.01). Compared with the values with fist motion, the aspect ratio was decreased and the circularity was increased with long-finger motion (p < 0.01). This report presents a method with which to assess displacement and deformation of the median nerve on a cross-sectional ultrasound image during different finger motions. This method may be useful to assess pathological changes within the carpal tunnel, and we plan to perform a similar study of patients with carpal tunnel syndrome on the basis of these preliminary data.

French recommendations on the management of invasive cervical cancer during pregnancy. Cervical cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers during pregnancy, but the management of such cases remains unclear. A Working Group was set up in 2007 in France to propose national recommendations for the management of pregnant patients with invasive cervical carcinoma. The recommendations are based on this literature review conducted by the members of the Working Group. Management of cervical cancer during pregnancy depends on 5 factors: stage of the disease (and the tumor size), nodal status, histological subtype of the tumor, term of the pregnancy, and whether the patient wishes to continue her pregnancy. In patients with early-stage disease diagnosed during the first 2 trimesters of pregnancy, there is an increasing tendency to preserve the pregnancy while awaiting fetal maturity in patients with absence of nodal involvement. The delivery (when the fetal maturity is attained) should be then performed using a cesarean section. This article proposes recommendations for the management of pregnant patients with invasive cervical cancer. These recommendations have been validated by the 3 main scientific societies of gynecologic oncology, pelvic surgery, and obstetrics and gynecology in France.


Characterizing Early Psychosocial Functioning of Parents of Children with Moderate to Severe Genital Ambiguity due to Disorders of Sex Development.

Connexin32 hemichannels contribute to the apoptotic-to-necrotic transition during Fas-mediated hepatocyte cell death. The present study was set up to investigate the fate of connexin32 and its channels in hepatocellular apoptosis. Primary hepatocyte cultures were exposed to Fas ligand and cycloheximide, and modifications in connexin32 expression and localization, and gap junction functionality were studied. We found that gap junction functionality rapidly declined upon progression of cell death, which was associated with a decay of the gap junctional connexin32 protein pool. Simultaneously, levels of newly synthesized connexin32 protein increased and gathered in a hemichannel configuration. This became particularly evident towards the end stages of the cell death process and was not reflected at the transcriptional level. We next either silenced connexin32 expression or inhibited connexin32 hemichannel activity prior to cell death induction. Both approaches resulted in a delayed termination of the cell death response. We conclude that connexin32 hemichannels facilitate the apoptotic-to-necrotic transition, which typically occurs in the final stage of hepatocellular apoptosis.

Hyperinsulinemic Normoglycemia Does Not Meaningfully Improve Myocardial Performance during Cardiac Surgery: A Randomized Trial.

Development of a loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay for sensitive and rapid detection of the tdh and trh genes of Vibrio parahaemolyticus and related Vibrio species. Thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH) and TDH-related hemolysin (TRH) are the major virulence determinants of Vibrio parahaemolyticus. TRH is further differentiated into TRH1 and TRH2 on the basis of genetic and phenotypic differences. We developed a novel and highly specific loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for sensitive and rapid detection of the tdh, trh1, and trh2 genes of V. parahaemolyticus. The LAMP assay was designed for both combined and individual detection of the tdh, trh1, and trh2 genes and combined detection of the trh1 and trh2 genes. Our results showed that it gave the same results as DNA probes and conventional PCR assays for 125 strains of V. parahaemolyticus, 3 strains of Grimontia hollisae, and 2 strains of Vibrio mimicus carrying the tdh, trh1, and trh2 genes in various combinations. No LAMP products were detected for any of the 20 bacterial strains lacking the tdh, trh1, and trh2 genes. The sensitivities of the LAMP assay for detection of tdh-, trh1-, and trh2-carrying V. parahaemolyticus strains in spiked shrimp samples were 0.8, 21.3, and 5.0 CFU per LAMP reaction tube, respectively. Starting with DNA extraction from a single colony and from spiked shrimp samples, the LAMP assay required only 27 to 60 min and less than 80 min, respectively. This is the first report of a rapid and specific LAMP assay for detection and differentiation of the tdh, trh1, and trh2 genes of V. parahaemolyticus and related Vibrio species.

Comparative Study of Soybean Oil and the Mixed Fatty Acids as Acyl Donors for Enzymatic Preparation of Feruloylated Acylglycerols in Ionic Liquids. Feruloylated acylglycerols (FAGs) are the lipophilic derivatives of ferulic acid. In this work, soybean oil (SBO) and the mixed fatty acids (MFA) were selected as fatty acyl donors, and reacted with glyceryl monoferulate (GMF) to prepare FAGs in ionic liquids (ILs). Effect of various reaction parameters (time, temperature, enzyme concentration, and substrate ratio) and ILs on the GMF conversion and the reaction selectivity for FAGs formation were investigated. Response surface methodology (RSM) based on a 3-level-4-factor Box-Behnken experimental design was employed to evaluate the inactive effect of reaction parameters. For the esterification of GMF with MFA, the maximum GMF conversion (98.9 Â± 0.9%) and FAG yield (88.9 Â± 0.6%) were achieved in [C10mim]PF6. However, for the transesterification of GMF with SBO, the maximum GMF conversion (94.3 Â± 0.7%) and FAG yield (83.8 Â± 1.0%) were obtained in [C12mim]PF6. High FAG selectivities (â¼0.90) were also obtained using SBO or MFA as acyl donors. 

Risk adjustment in the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program: a comparison of logistic versus hierarchical modeling. Although logistic regression has commonly been used to adjust for risk differences in patient and case mix to permit quality comparisons across hospitals, hierarchical modeling has been advocated as the preferred methodology, because it accounts for clustering of patients within hospitals. It is unclear whether hierarchical models would yield important differences in quality assessments compared with logistic models when applied to American College of Surgeons (ACS) National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP) data. Our objective was to evaluate differences in logistic versus hierarchical modeling for identifying hospitals with outlying outcomes in the ACS-NSQIP. Data from ACS-NSQIP patients who underwent colorectal operations in 2008 at hospitals that reported at least 100 operations were used to generate logistic and hierarchical prediction models for 30-day morbidity and mortality. Differences in risk-adjusted performance (ratio of observed-to-expected events) and outlier detections from the two models were compared. Logistic and hierarchical models identified the same 25 hospitals as morbidity outliers (14 low and 11 high outliers), but the hierarchical model identified 2 additional high outliers. Both models identified the same eight hospitals as mortality outliers (five low and three high outliers). The values of observed-to-expected events ratios and p values from the two models were highly correlated. Results were similar when data were permitted from hospitals providing < 100 patients. When applied to ACS-NSQIP data, logistic and hierarchical models provided nearly identical results with respect to identification of hospitals' observed-to-expected events ratio outliers. As hierarchical models are prone to implementation problems, logistic regression will remain an accurate and efficient method for performing risk adjustment of hospital quality comparisons.

Interplast Italy: a 20-year plastic and reconstructive surgery humanitarian experience in developing countries. Interplast Italy is a nongovernment, nonprofit organization with the aim of providing high-quality standard reconstructive procedures, contributing to local medical and nursing education, in those countries where this is not available or where the local resources are inadequate to meet local needs. A recent debate about the real aim and the effectiveness of this kind of health support strategy in developing countries has been raised. The authors report a 20-year experience, explaining operative strategy, activities, and results, and contributing to the development and improvement of the philosophy of humanitarian missions. Since 1988, 47 missions and 5235 operations have been performed. A total of 2286 patients (43.7 percent) were younger than 18 years, and 2949 (56.3 percent) were above that age. Congenital cleft deformity was the most common diagnosis in 2415 patients (46.13 percent). Patients suffering from postburn contractures were operated on in 1956 cases (37.36 percent). The number of postburn children operated on was 922 (17.6 percent). Cooperation with local physicians is considered mandatory to guarantee adequate patient preselection, to organize the activity in situ, and to plan continuous effective work on a regular basis to build local capacity and facilitate sustainable models for health care. Furthermore, as local surgeons become interested in reconstructive surgery, continuous teaching through a multidisciplinary approach must be paramount. The activity of Interplast Italy contributed to building a plastic surgery service in Bangladesh. Combined multidisciplinary activities linked to established organizations such as the Interplast confederation are desirable to improve results. A link with structured organizations is needed to obtain financial resources to extend targets and to improve activities and outcomes.

Evidence for anomalous network connectivity during working memory encoding in schizophrenia: an ICA based analysis. Numerous neuroimaging studies report abnormal regional brain activity during working memory performance in schizophrenia, but few have examined brain network integration as determined by "functional connectivity" analyses. We used independent component analysis (ICA) to identify and characterize dysfunctional spatiotemporal networks in schizophrenia engaged during the different stages (encoding and recognition) of a Sternberg working memory fMRI paradigm. 37 chronic schizophrenia and 54 healthy age/gender-matched participants performed a modified Sternberg Item Recognition fMRI task. Time series images preprocessed with SPM2 were analyzed using ICA. Schizophrenia patients showed relatively less engagement of several distinct "normal" encoding-related working memory networks compared to controls. These encoding networks comprised 1) left posterior parietal-left dorsal/ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, cingulate, basal ganglia, 2) right posterior parietal, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and 3) default mode network. In addition, the left fronto-parietal network demonstrated a load-dependent functional response during encoding. Network engagement that differed between groups during recognition comprised the posterior cingulate, cuneus and hippocampus/parahippocampus. As expected, working memory task accuracy differed between groups (p<0.0001) and was associated with degree of network engagement. Functional connectivity within all three encoding-associated functional networks correlated significantly with task accuracy, which further underscores the relevance of abnormal network integration to well-described schizophrenia working memory impairment. No network was significantly associated with task accuracy during the recognition phase. This study extends the results of numerous previous schizophrenia studies that identified isolated dysfunctional brain regions by providing evidence of disrupted schizophrenia functional connectivity using ICA within widely-distributed neural networks engaged for working memory cognition.

[Lung function in patients with diabetes mellitus]. Diabetes mellitus is a disease affecting a lot of organs. One of the little known diabetes complication is impairment of pulmonary function. The aim of this study was to compare pulmonary function in two groups: diabetic individuals and obese non-diabetic individuals and to investigate predictive factors of alteration of diffusing capacity of lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). We retrospectively included all patients hospitalized in department of endocrinology between 1st July 2013 and 31 December 2013 and who underwent pulmonary function tests. All these medical charts of patients were reviewed and patients were classified in two groups: diabetic and obese non-diabetic individuals. Overall, 89 patients were included, 62 diabetic patients and 27 obese non-diabetic patients. Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), medium expiratory flow, expiratory residual volume, total lung capacity (TLC) and DLCO were significantly lower in patients with diabetes mellitus compared to obese non-diabetic patients. A low DLCO was significantly associated with diabetic neuropathy, macrovascular complication (carotid atheroma), impairment of renal function, and insulin treatment. Respiratory function is impaired in diabetes mellitus, with a significant decrease in FVC, FEV1, TLC and DLCO.

IKKepsilon phosphorylation of estrogen receptor alpha Ser-167 and contribution to tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer. IKKepsilon has recently been identified as a breast cancer oncogene. Elevated levels of IKKepsilon are associated with cell survival and growth. Here, we show that IKKepsilon interacts with and phosphorylates estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) on serine 167 in vitro and in vivo. As a result, IKKepsilon induces ERalpha transactivation activity and enhances ERalpha binding to DNA. Cyclin D1, a major target of ERalpha, is transcriptionally up-regulated by IKKepsilon in a phospho-ERalpha-Ser-167-dependent manner. Further, overexpression of IKKepsilon induces tamoxifen resistance, whereas knockdown of IKKepsilon sensitizes cells to tamoxifen-induced cell death. These data suggest that ERalpha is a bona fide substrate of IKKepsilon and IKKepsilon plays an important role in tamoxifen resistance. Thus, IKKepsilon represents a critical therapeutic target in breast cancer.

Adaptation of Corynebacterium glutamicum to salt-stress conditions.

Expression of a novel member of the odorant-binding protein gene family in Culex nigripalpus (Diptera: Culicidae). We previously showed that gene expression in the midgut of female Culex nigripalpus Theobald (Diptera: Culicidae) was altered after ingestion of a bloodmeal and some of the expressed cDNAs showed stage-, sex-, and tissue-specific expression. One of these expressed cDNAs, CN G11B, is here shown to be similar to members of a gene family that encodes odorant-binding proteins. CN G11B.1 is a cDNA fragment of 721 bp, is incomplete at the 5'-end, and contains a canonical polyadenylic acid tail signal sequence in the 103-bp 3'-untranslated region. Translation of CN G11B.1 provides a putative protein product of 207 amino acids. GenBank tblastx, VectorBase, and Pfam database searches showed identity to hypothetical proteins from Culex pipiens quinquefasciatus Say (86%) and Aedes aegypti (L.) (55%). These proteins have structural motifs similar to those found in the gene family that includes odorant-binding proteins. CN G11B.1 putative protein has two of the six cysteines that are highly conserved in most invertebrate odorant-binding proteins. CN G11B.1 expression increased in thoraces (6-12 h) and in abdomens (3-48 h) of blood fed female Cx. nigripalpus but was not detected in RNA from heads, indicating a possible role in both chemoreception and blood feeding.

Culturing the adolescent brain: what can neuroscience learn from anthropology? Cultural neuroscience is set to flourish in the next few years. As the field develops, it is necessary to reflect on what is meant by 'culture' and how this can be translated for the laboratory context. This article uses the example of the adolescent brain to discuss three aspects of culture that may help us to shape and reframe questions, interpretations and applications in cultural neuroscience: cultural contingencies of categories, cultural differences in experience and cultural context of neuroscience research. The last few years have seen a sudden increase in the study of adolescence as a period of both structural and functional plasticity, with new brain-based explanations of teenage behaviour being taken up in education, policy and medicine. However, the concept of adolescence, as an object of behavioural science, took shape relatively recently, not much more than a hundred years ago and was shaped by a number of cultural and historical factors. Moreover, research in anthropology and cross-cultural psychology has shown that the experience of adolescence, as a period of the lifespan, is variable and contingent upon culture. The emerging field of cultural neuroscience has begun to tackle the question of cultural differences in social cognitive processing in adults. In this article, I explore what a cultural neuroscience can mean in the case of adolescence. I consider how to integrate perspectives from social neuroscience and anthropology to conceptualize, and to empirically study, adolescence as a culturally variable phenomenon, which, itself, has been culturally constructed.

HEADS-UP SURGERY FOR VITREORETINAL PROCEDURES: An Experimental and Clinical Study. To investigate the feasibility of performing vitrectomies while viewing a three-dimensional image on a large display in a heads-up position. Twenty volunteers were compared performing meticulous tasks using the heads-up and the traditional method. Some optical parameters, resolution and depth of field, were measured, and the possibilities of digital image processing were investigated. In addition, routine use of the heads-up method for >400 vitrectomies over 8 months was retrospectively analyzed. Of note, 91.7% of the volunteers preferred the ergonomics of the heads-up technique. The two methods were judged to be similar regarding speed and ease of microscopic manipulations and sharpness of image. Significantly fewer mistakes were made with the heads-up method. The measured resolution of the eyepieces was approximately twice that of the three-dimensional display, whereas depth of the field was about equal. Electronic amplification of the camera's signal resulted in increased image brightness, allowing use of reduced endoillumination levels. In clinical routine, better ergonomics, digital image processing, and use of a large display are found to be major advantages. The heads-up method is well suited for vitreoretinal surgery. With further technical improvements, the procedure should soon find widespread use.

Pitfalls of high-pass filtering for detecting epileptic oscillations: a technical note on "false" ripples. To analyze interictal High frequency oscillations (HFOs) as observed in the medial temporal lobe of epileptic patients and animals (ripples, 80-200Hz and fast ripples, 250-600Hz). To show that the identification of interictal HFOs raises some methodological issues, as the filtering of sharp transients (e.g., epileptic spikes or artefacts) or signals with harmonics can result in "false" ripples. To illustrate and quantify the occurrence of false ripples on filtered EEG traces. We have performed high-pass filtering on both simulated and real data. We have also used two alternate methods: time-frequency analysis and matching pursuit. Two types of events were shown to produce oscillations after filtering that could be confounded with actual oscillatory activity: sharp transients and harmonics of non-sinusoidal signals. High-pass filtering of EEG traces for detection of oscillatory activity should be performed with great care. Filtered traces should be compared to original traces for verification of presence of transients. Additional techniques such as time-frequency transforms or sparse decompositions are highly beneficial. Our study draws the attention on an issue of great importance in the marking of HFOs on EEG traces. We illustrate complementary methods that can help both researchers and clinicians.

Length of residence and obesity among immigrants in Spain. Various studies in the USA and Canada have consistently shown a positive association between length of residence of immigrants and obesity. Studies in European countries have obtained less consistent results. The present work assesses the influence of length of residence on the frequency of obesity in immigrants in the city of Madrid, Spain. We studied a sample of 7155 persons aged 18 years and over residing in the city of Madrid, who were was surveyed between November 2004 and May 2005. Information was collected on immigrant status (country of birth), length of residence in Spain, obesity, sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle. Compared with the Spanish population, the odds for obesity in the immigrant population by length of residence was less than one in all groups, becoming closer to one with increasing time of residence (OR = 0.67, 0.73 and 0.81 for immigrants with less than 2, 2-4 and 5-9 years of residence in Spain, respectively), up to 10 or more years of residence, when it declined (OR = 0.69). The magnitude of this association was considerably reduced after adjusting for sociodemographic variables and for perceived health, but was not further modified after adjusting for lifestyle variables. Length of residence of immigrants in the city of Madrid is not associated with the frequency of obesity. It is possible that the circumstances immigrants encounter after arriving in Spain do not involve an overexposure to factors favouring obesity, relative to those they bring with them.

Plaque location in the left anterior descending coronary artery and tissue characteristics in angina pectoris: an integrated backscatter intravascular ultrasound study. Ruptured plaque and culprit lesions associated with anterior acute myocardial infarction cluster mainly in the proximal segment of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). This study investigated whether the tissue characteristics of plaque in the proximal LAD differs from that of plaque in the distal LAD as assessed by integrated backscatter (IB)-intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). IVUS interrogation was used to study 107 non-culprit intermediate plaques in 68 patients with angina pectoris who underwent percutaneous coronary interventions. Proximal and distal segments were defined as <30 mm and > or =30 mm from the ostium, respectively. IB-IVUS images were recorded, and the average percentage values of each plaque component (lipid, fibrosis, dense fibrosis, and calcification) were compared between segments. Plaques in the proximal segment (n=51) had a higher %lipid content (36 vs 19%, P<0.01) and a lower %fibrosis content (57 vs 64%, P<0.01) than did plaques in the distal segment (n=56). Multiple linear regression analysis showed that proximal plaques had a higher %lipid content, independently of other coronary risk factors and plaque burden (P<0.01). The %lipid and %fibrosis contents differ significantly between plaques in the proximal segment and those in the distal segment of the LAD. (Circ J 2010; 74: 142 - 147).


Parenthood and immunomodulation in patients with multiple sclerosis.

Pediatric emergencies associated with fever. Fever is defined as a rectal temperature greater than 38.0 degrees C (>100.4 degrees F). A recently documented fever at home should be considered the same as a fever in the ED and should be managed similarly. All febrile infants younger than 28 days should receive a "full sepsis workup" and be admitted for parenteral antibiotic therapy. Clinical and laboratory criteria can be used to identify a low-risk population of febrile infants aged 1 to 4 months who have not received 2 doses of conjugate vaccines for bacterial meningitis. Children with sickle cell disease are at high risk and require special evaluation. MRSA infections are now common and should be considered in all patients with pyoderma, severe pneumonia, and catheter-related sepsis. HSV infection of the CNS should be considered whenever a patient has altered mental status and CSF findings are not diagnostic of bacterial meningitis. Fever rarely represents life-threatening pathology; however, a handful of less common serious causes of pediatric fever exist with the potential for morbidity and mortality.

RGS4 controls renal blood flow and inhibits cyclosporine-mediated nephrotoxicity. Calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) are powerful immunomodulatory agents that produce marked renal dysfunction due in part to endothelin-1-mediated reductions in renal blood flow. Ligand-stimulated Gq protein signaling promotes the contraction of smooth muscle cells via phospholipase Cbeta-mediated stimulation of cytosolic calcium release. RGS4 is a GTPase activating protein that promotes the deactivation of Gq and Gi family members. To investigate the role of G protein-mediated signaling in the pathogenesis of CNI-mediated renal injury, we used mice deficient for RGS4 (rgs4(-/-)). Compared to congenic wild type control animals, rgs4(-/-) mice were intolerant of the CNI, cyclosporine (CyA), rapidly developing fatal renal failure. Rgs4(-/-) mice exhibited markedly reduced renal blood flow after CyA treatment when compared to congenic wild type control mice as measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Hypoperfusion was reversed by coadministration of CyA with the endothelin antagonist, bosentan. The MAPK/ERK pathway was activated by cyclosporine administration and was inhibited by cotreatment with bosentan. These results show that endothelin-1-mediated Gq protein signaling plays a key role in the pathogenesis of vasoconstrictive renal injury and that RGS4 antagonizes the deleterious effects of excess endothelin receptor activation in the kidney.

Development of a novel imaging system for cell therapy in the brain. Stem cells have been evaluated as a potential therapeutic approach for several neurological disorders of the central and peripheral nervous system as well as for traumatic brain and spinal cord injury. Currently, the lack of a reliable and safe method to accurately and non-invasively locate the site of implantation and track the migration of stem cells in vivo hampers the development of stem cell therapy and its clinical application. In this report, we present data that demonstrate the feasibility of using the human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS) as a reporter gene for tracking neural stem cells (NSCs) after transplantation in the brain by using single-photon emission tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT) imaging. NSCs were isolated from the hippocampus of adult rats (Hipp-NSCs) and transduced with a lentiviral vector containing the hNIS gene. Hipp-NSCs expressing the hNIS (NIS-Hipp-NSCs) were characterized in vitro and in vivo after transplantation in the rat brain and imaged by using technetium-99m ((99m)Tc) and a small rodent SPECT/CT apparatus. Comparisons were made between Hipp-NSCs and NIS-Hipp-NSCs, and statistical analysis was performed by using two-tailed Student's t test. Our results show that the expression of the hNIS allows the repeated visualization of NSCs in vivo in the brain by using SPECT/CT imaging and does not affect the ability of Hipp-NSCs to generate neuronal and glial cells in vitro and in vivo. These data support the use of the hNIS as a reporter gene for non-invasive imaging of NSCs in the brain. The repeated, non-invasive tracking of implanted cells will accelerate the development of effective stem cell therapies for traumatic brain injury and other types of central nervous system injury.

Personal commentary: monitoring subsequent pregnancy in recovered peripartum cardiomyopathy mothers. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is defined as the first appearance of systolic heart failure in a previously healthy woman during the last month of pregnancy or up to 6 months postpartum. Both planned and unplanned pregnancies may occur in recovered and non-recovered PPCM mothers, requiring careful counseling and management strategies. Previous studies indicate that relapse of heart failure in post-PPCM pregnancies is always a possibility, even in recovered PPCM mothers. The risk of relapse is high when the left ventricular ejection fraction is less than 0.50, and should be considered a relative contraindication to subsequent pregnancy. There are not yet established protocols for monitoring subsequent pregnancies in those who once had PPCM, and few medical articles with guidelines. This personal commentary contains parameters that have been found useful to contribute to safer monitoring with improved outcomes.

The transcript elongation factor FACT affects Arabidopsis vegetative and reproductive development and genetically interacts with HUB1/2. The facilitates chromatin transcription (FACT) complex, consisting of the SSRP1 and SPT16 proteins, is a histone chaperone that assists the progression of transcribing RNA polymerase on chromatin templates by destabilizing nucleosomes. Here, we examined plants that harbour mutations in the genes encoding the subunits of Arabidopsis FACT. These experiments revealed that (i) SSRP1 is critical for plant viability, and (ii) plants with reduced amounts of SSRP1 and SPT16 display various defects in vegetative and reproductive development. Thus, mutant plants display an increased number of leaves and inflorescences, show early bolting, have abnormal flower and leaf architecture, and their seed production is severely affected. The early flowering of the mutant plants is associated with reduced expression of the floral repressor FLC in ssrp1 and spt16 plants. Compared to control plants, reduced amounts of FACT in mutant plants are detected at the FLC locus as well as at the locations of housekeeping genes (whose expression is not affected in the mutants), suggesting that expression of FLC is particularly sensitive to reduced FACT activity. Analysis of double mutants that are affected in the expression of both FACT subunits and factors catalysing the mono-ubiquitination of histone H2B (HUB1/2) demonstrates that they genetically interact to regulate various developmental processes (i.e. branching, leaf venation pattern, silique development) but independently regulate the growth of leaves and the induction of flowering.

Hypoxia switches glucose depletion-induced necrosis to phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt-dependent apoptosis in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. In solid tumours, necrosis is commonly found in the core region in response to metabolic stress that results from oxygen and glucose depletion (OGD) due to insufficient vascularization and has been implicated in tumour progression. We have previously shown that metabolic stress due to glucose depletion (GD) induces necrosis and HMGB1 release through mitochondrial ROS production in A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. In this study, we examined the effects of hypoxia on GD-induced necrosis and show that hypoxia prevented GD-induced mitochondrial ROS production, HMGB1 release, and necrosis and switched the cell death mode to apoptosis that is dependent on caspase-3 and -9. We further found that inhibition of ERK1/2 by U0126 abolished the effects of hypoxia to switch the cell death mode and to suppress mitochondrial ROS production, indicating an important role(s) of the ERK pathway in cell death mode determination. We also found that during OGD-induced apoptosis the prosurvival protein kinase Akt is activated and inhibition of Akt by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin prevent OGD-induced apoptosis, caspase-3 and -9 activation, and nuclear translocation of AIF and EndoG. Similar inhibitory effects of PI3K inhibitors were observed in A549 cells that underwent apoptosis when treated with GD in the presence of NAC (a general antioxidant) or catalase (a H(2)O(2) scavenger), or in the presence of active PKC by treatment with phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, indicating a crucial role(s) of the PI3K-Akt pathway in OGD-indcued apoptosis. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that hypoxia switches GD-induced necrosis to apoptosis and ERK1/2 and PI3K-Akt exert anti-necrotic and pro-apoptotic activities in the cell death, respectively.

An estimation of the frequency of surgery  for posthysterectomy vault prolapse. We tried to estimate the frequency of surgery for posthysterectomy vault prolapse. We contacted all 86 departments of gynecology in Austria and asked them about total number of hysterectomies and total number of operations for vault prolapse. We then calculated a percentage of patients undergoing surgery for posthysterectomy vault prolapse. Sixty-five of 86 public hospitals replied (response rate 76%) and reported a total of 7,645 hysterectomies and 577 operations for vault prolapse for the year 2005, giving a percentage of 7.16 for surgery for posthysterectomy vault prolapse. On the assumption that vault prolapse takes on the average 10 years to develop and that the number of hysterectomies decreased by 10% over 10 years, we calculated a modified frequency of 6.52%. We were able to calculate an estimation of the frequency for posthysterectomy vault prolapse requiring surgical repair between 6% and 8%.

Infectious hepatopathies in dogs and cats. This article serves to review the various infectious diseases that affect the liver primarily or as a part of systemic infection. Although bacterial infections are probably the most common cause of infectious hepatitis, the clinician should be aware of other potential organisms and other commonly involved systems. Therefore, this article includes a description of common bacterial, mycobacterial, viral, fungal, protozoal, parasitic, and rickettsial diseases in dogs and cats.

MEG based classification of wrist movement. Neural activity is very important source for data mining and can be used as a control signal for brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Particularly, Magnetic signals of neurons are enriched with information about the movement of different part of the body such as wrist movement. In this paper, we use MEG (Magneto encephalography) signals of two subjects recorded during wrist movement task in four directions. Data were prepared for BCI competition 2008 for multiclass classification. Our approach for this classification problem consists of PCA as a noise reduction method, ULDA for feature reduction and various linear classifiers such as Bayesian, KNN and SVM. Final results (58%-62% for subject 1 and 36%-40% for subject 2) prove that the suggested method shows better performance compared with other methods.


Immature blood vessels in rheumatoid synovium are selectively depleted in response to anti-TNF therapy.

Submental perforator flap design with a near-infrared fluorescence imaging system: the relationship among number of perforators, flap perfusion, and venous drainage. The submental flap is a reliable alternative to microsurgical reconstruction of facial deformities, providing an excellent cosmetic match with the contour and color of the face. In this study, the authors evaluated submental flap design by using near-infrared fluorescence angiography to identify perforator arteries. The impact of the number of preserved perforator arteries on flap perfusion and venous drainage was quantified. Indocyanine green was injected intravenously into 18 pigs. Three groups of six animals each had one, two, or three perforator arteries preserved. The fluorescence-assisted resection and exploration near-infrared fluorescence imaging system was used for image acquisition. Images were recorded before and after flap creation, and every hour, for 6 hours. The time to maximum perfusion, the drainage ratio (an indicator of venous drainage), and the percentage of perfused flap area were analyzed statistically at each time point. Flaps with a single dominant perforator artery had an initial mean perfused area of 80 percent, which improved to 97 percent at 6 hours. For flaps with two and three preserved perforator arteries, perfused area at 6 hours was 99.8 percent and 100 percent, respectively. A significant increase was observed in all three metrics as more vessels were preserved. Regardless of the number of perforator arteries preserved, though, all three metrics improved over 6 hours. Near-infrared fluorescence angiography can reliably identify submental perforator arteries for flap design and can be used to assess flap perfusion and venous drainage in real time. Flap metrics at 6 hours were equivalent when either one or multiple perforator arteries were preserved.

Regional tissue oxygenation in association with duration of hypoxaemia and haemodynamic variability in preterm neonates. To assess the effect of the duration of spontaneous hypoxic episodes and variations in haemodynamic parameters on cerebral and renal tissue oxygenation (rSo(2)C and rSo(2)R) in clinically stable preterm infants. Observational study. Neonatal intensive care unit of a university-affiliated children's hospital. Patients rSo(2)C and rSo(2)R and haemodynamic parameters were recorded for 2-3 h (once or twice) in clinically stable preterm neonates (n=10) using near-infrared spectroscopy, GE DASH 4000 and Bedmaster Software. rSo(2)C and rSo(2)R and fractional oxygen extraction (cerebral and renal fractional oxygen extraction: FOE-C and FOE-R, respectively) in association with the duration of pulse oximetry desaturation (pulse oximetry saturations (Sao(2)) < or =84%), bradycardia (heart rate < or =90 beats/min) and hypotension (mean blood pressure (MBP) <30 mm Hg). Among the 14 sets of recorded measurements, 128 hypoxic episodes with 5-10 (n=41), 15-20 (n=26), 25-30 (n=78), 35-40 (n=14), 45-50 (n=25) and > or =55 s (n=16) duration were identified. Prolongation of hypoxic episodes for more than 30 s was associated with major reductions in Sao(2), rSo(2)C and rSo(2)R without any significant changes in the regional FOE. Bradycardia occurred during 43.8% of hypoxaemic episodes of > or =55 s duration (p<0.01) and impacted the severity of the tissue deoxygenation. Decreased rSo(2)R and increased FOE-R were observed in association with mild hypotension irrespective of the systemic oxygenation status. Prolongation of hypoxaemia contributes to the severity of the deoxygenation (systemic and regional) and development of bradycardia. In stable preterm neonates, mild decreases in MBP independently affect the renal but not cerebral tissue oxygenation and oxygen utilisation.

Population prevalence of depression and mean Beck Depression Inventory score. For some phenomena the mean of population distributions predicts the proportion of people exceeding a threshold value. To investigate whether in depression, too, the population mean predicts the number of individuals at the extreme end of the distribution. We used data from the European Outcome in Depression International Network (ODIN) study from populations in Finland, Norway and the UK to create models that predicted the prevalence of depression based on the mean Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score. The models were tested on data from Ireland and Spain. Mean BDI score correlated well with the prevalence of depression determined by clinical interviews. A model based on the beta distribution best fitted the BDI distribution. Both models predicted the depression prevalence in Ireland and Spain fairly well. The mean of a continuous population distribution of mood predicts the prevalence of depression. Characteristics of both individuals and populations determine depression rates.

Novel quinolines and pyrimido[4,5-b]quinolines bearing biologically active sulfonamide moiety as a new class of antitumor agents. Some novel quinolines and pyrimido[4,5-b]quinolines have been synthesized. The structures of which were confirmed by elemental analyses and spectral data. All the target compounds were subjected to in-vitro antitumor activity against Ehrlich Ascites Carcinoma (EAC) cells. Compounds 24, 19 and 12 showed higher activity with IC(50) values (5.5, 6.9, 7 microg/ml) when compared with Doxorubicin as a reference drug (IC(50) value 38 microg/ml).


Cognitive appraisal and perceived benefits of dysvascular lower limb amputation: a longitudinal study.

Identification of small world topologies in neural functional connections quantified by phase synchrony measures. The brain is a complex biological system with dynamic interactions between its sub-systems. One particular challenge in the study of this complex system is the identification of dynamic functional networks underlying observed neural activity. Current imaging approaches index local neural activity very well, but there is an increasing need for methods that quantify the interaction between regional activations. In this paper, we focus on inferring the functional connectivity of the brain based on electroencephalography (EEG) data. The interactions between the different neuronal populations are quantified through a recently proposed dynamic measure of phase synchrony. Small world measures, which include clustering coefficient, path length, global efficiency, and local efficiency, are computed on graphs obtained through the phase synchrony measure to study the underlying functional networks. The proposed measures are applied to an EEG study containing the error-related negativity (ERN), a brain potential response that indexes endogenous action monitoring, to determine the organization of the brain during a decision making task and determine the differences between Error and Correct responses.

Hyaluronidase in the correction of hyaluronic acid-based fillers: a review and a recommendation for use. Hyaluronic acid (HA) preparations are the most commonly used injectable fillers in esthetic medicine. In contrast to other injectable fillers with hyaluronidase, there is a tool available to reduce unwanted depots of this filler. The aim of this paper is to give an overview on the present literature and in addition to give some recommendations for use based on the experience of the authors. The overview is based on a literature search. There is some evidence from two smaller clinical trials that hyaluronidase will effectively decrease injected depots of HA. It has further been shown from case series and case reports that this reduction is clinically relevant. There is less evidence that hyaluronidase is also helpful in adverse reactions to HA-based fillers. The reports suggest that the treatment is safe. However, adverse reactions to hyaluronidase such as allergic reactions have been reported. Patient should be informed about that before treatment.

Increased Risk of Dementia in Patients With Acute Organophosphate and Carbamate Poisoning: A Nationwide Population-Based Cohort Study.

A morphological approach to the simulation of forearm motion. Computer-based simulations support surgeons in preoperative planning of osteotomy and assessing the improvement of the forearm motion. To this end, an in-silico model of patient-specific forearm kinematics is required. In this paper we introduce a motion model of the forearm which is based on a patient's joint morphology, the form and shape of the joints. The morphology of the articulations is represented by 3-dimensional splines. In this way the gliding motion of the articulations is expressed analytically in a closed-form. Our algorithm was designed to work with available clinical planning data and requires minimal user interaction. This allows an integration in computer-aided planning systems that are operated by surgeons. The accuracy of the simulation results is verified via cadaver experiments.

Cytochrome P450 loss-of-function polymorphism genotyping on the Agilent Bioanalyzer and clinical application. Responses to toxins and drugs, even to standard medical drug treatment regimens, can vary significantly between individuals. Similar dosages can have divergent results due to polymorphisms in the genes that code for the enzymes responsible for the metabolism of drugs. The focus of this report is to describe our exploration of the personalized medicine approach for patient care at Sydney West Area Health Service. We would like to demonstrate the importance of this approach as it is the subject of debate in the medical and scientific community. The critical points in this debate are the cost of testing, laboratory space required and clinical application. We have shown that a simple approach and instruments like the Agilent Bioanalyzer could be cost effective for laboratory operation. The Agilent Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA) can be used for proteins, DNA and cell studies. Hence, reduced cost of instruments, laboratory space requirements, maintenance and operational costs are great advantages of this technology, especially for development and research laboratories.

Health assessment of artisanal gold miners in Indonesia. Small scale miners use mercury to extract gold from ore in many countries. An environmental and health assessment was performed in Indonesia in two regions, Galangan in Central Kalimantan and Talawaan in Northern Sulawesi. The environmental assessment showed severe mercury contamination of the sediments, and increased mercury levels in local fish. For the health investigation 281 volunteers were recruited and examined by a standardized questionnaire, a neurological examination and neuro-psychological tests. A medical score was used consisting of significant factors of mercury intoxication. Mercury exposed workers showed typical symptoms of mercury intoxication, such as movement disorders (ataxia, tremor, dysdiadochokinesia, etc.). Blood, urine and hair samples were taken from any participant and analyzed for mercury. The mercury concentration in the biomonitors was high, partly extreme high in the working population, increased in the population living in the same habitat and low in the control group. By a standard protocol which includes a combination of threshold values of mercury in the biomonitors and a medical sum score the diagnosis of chronic mercury intoxication was made for highly burdened workers (amalgam smelters) in 55% in Sulawesi and in 62% in Kalimantan. Less exposed mineral processors and the general population in the mining areas were also intoxicated to a high percentage.

Antitumor effect of BPR-DC-2, a novel synthetic cyclic cyanoguanidine derivative, involving the inhibition of MDR-1 expression and down-regulation of p-AKT and PARP-1 in lung cancer. In our previous study, a series of novel cyclic cyanoguanidine compounds, eg. 5-substituted 2-cyanoimino-4-imidazodinone and 2-cyanoimino-4- pyrimidinone derivatives have been successfully synthesized and showed remarkable cytotoxicity in several cancer cell lines. In this present study, it is our aim to screen more potential candidates among the cyclic pyridyl cyanoguanidine compounds (BPR-DC-1, 2, 3) by in vitro and in vivo studies for the therapy of lung cancer, alternatively. Our results showed that BPR-DC-2 significantly inhibited proliferation of tumor cells with an IC50 of 3.60 Â± 1.27 and 14.81 Â± 4.23 Î¼M in human lung carcinoma cells, H69 and A549, respectively by the MTT assay at 48 hr; BPR-DC-2 also obviously suppressed the tumor proliferation and MDR-1 gene expression, even induced cell apoptosis in the ex vivo histocultured lung tumor. We further demonstrated that, in the nude mouse model of metastatic lung cancer, BPR-DC-2 could diminish the tumor mass, retard the progression of metastasis, and prolong the survival time. In addition, it was found that BPR-DC-2 exerted its anti-tumor effects through the inhibition of MDR-1 gene expression and down-regulation of tumor anti-apoptosis signals (activated p-AKT and over-expression of PARP-1) by western blotting analysis. In conclusion, in this present study we have demonstrated that BPR-DC-2, derived from a series of novel synthetic cyclic cyanoguanidine compounds, has proved its potential as an anti-tumor drug candidate in treating lung cancer.


Hemodynamic models of cerebral aneurysms for assessment of effect of vessel geometry on risk of rupture.

Postnatal tissue-specific disruption of transcription factor FoxN1 triggers acute thymic atrophy. The transcription factor FoxN1 is essential for differentiation of thymic epithelial cell (TEC) progenitors during thymic organogenesis. However, limited information is available on the postnatal contribution of FoxN1 to thymic maintenance. To address this question, we generated a loxP-floxed FoxN1 (fx) mouse with three different promoter-driven inducible CreER(T) transgenes. Postnatal ubiquitous deletion of FoxN1 caused dramatic thymic atrophy in 5 days and more severe deterioration in medullary TECs (mTECs) than in cortical TECs (cTECs). Induction of FoxN1 deletion selectively in K5 promoter-driven somatic epithelial cells (mostly mTECs and possibly some adult epithelial stem cells) was sufficient to cause significant thymic atrophy, whereas FoxN1 deletion in K18 promoter-driven somatic epithelial cells (mostly cTECs) was not. Thymic atrophy resulted from increased apoptosis and was associated with activation of the p53 gene in mature mTECs. Although FoxN1 is required for the development of both mTECs and cTECs in thymic organogenesis, it is most important for the maintenance of mTECs in the postnatal thymus, which are in turn necessary to prevent thymic atrophy.

Sleep Apnea and Risk of Panic Disorder. Epidemiological studies have identified a trend in the development of depressive and anxiety disorders following a diagnosis of sleep apnea. The relationship between sleep apnea and subsequent panic disorder, however, remains unclear. Using a nationwide database, the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, patients with sleep apnea and age-, sex-, income-, and urbanization-matched control patients who did not have sleep apnea were enrolled between 2000 and 2010. Patients with a prior diagnosis of panic disorder before enrollment were excluded. The 2 cohorts were observed until December 31, 2010. The primary endpoint was occurrence of newly diagnosed panic disorder. A total of 8,704 sleep apnea patients and 34,792 control patients were enrolled. Of the 43,496 patients, 263 (0.60%) suffered from panic disorder during a mean follow-up period of 3.92 years, including 117 (1.34%) from the sleep apnea cohort and 146 (0.42%) from the control group. The Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a predisposition of patients with sleep apnea to develop panic disorder (log-rank test, P <.001). After multivariate adjustment, the hazard ratio for subsequent panic disorder among the sleep apnea patients was 2.17 (95% confidence interval, 1.68-2.81; P <.001). Sleep apnea appears to confer a higher risk for future development of panic disorder.

Comparison of kinetic strategies for avoidance of an obstacle with either the paretic or non-paretic as leading limb in persons post stroke. The task of stepping over obstacles is known to be particularly risky for persons post stroke. A kinetic analysis informing on the movement strategies used to ensure clearance of the leading limb over an obstacle is, however, lacking. We examined obstacle avoidance strategies in six community dwelling stroke survivors comparing the use of paretic and non-paretic limb as the leading limb for clearance over obstacles measuring 7.5% and 15% of their total leg length. Subjects were able to increase foot clearance height in both limbs in order to avoid the two obstacles. Obstacle clearance with the non-paretic limb leading was associated with positive knee flexor work that increased when stepping over each obstacle, thus showing a normal knee strategy that flexes both the knee and the hip for foot clearance. There was also slightly increased hip flexor contribution for non-paretic obstacle clearance that was the same for both obstacle heights. When the paretic limb led during obstacle clearance, there was also evidence of an increased knee flexor moment, suggesting a residual knee strategy, but it was less pronounced than for the non-paretic limb and was assisted by greater vertical hip elevation and additional positive hip flexor work that both gained greater importance with increased obstacle height. These findings suggest that rehabilitation should explore the ability to improve the residual, but less powerful, knee flexor strategy in the paretic limb in specific patients, with further promotion of a hip flexor and limb elevation strategy depending on patient deficits and obstacle height. 

Sex dimorphism in periodontitis in animal models. Although surveys in the USA have shown that male subjects are more prone to develop periodontitis, sex as a risk factor in periodontitis, and its mechanism, remain controversial. Animal models are ideal for investigating immunological mechanisms of sex dimorphism in periodontitis because in these models it is possible to exclude the interference of gender-related risk factors, such as smoking and oral hygiene habits. Based on surveys in humans and reports on sex dimorphism in other diseases, our hypothesis is that sex is a risk factor in periodontitis. Different murine models (oral gavage model and ligature model) for periodontitis have been utilized to determine susceptibility to periodontitis in female and male mice. Periodontal bone levels were measured as the distance from the cemento-enamel junction to the alveolar bone crest (CEJ-ABC) in young female or male mice (8-10Â wk of age). Differential expression of inflammatory mediators in the gingivae of female and male mice was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. In comparison with male mice, female mice displayed significantly (pÂ <Â 0.05) increased periodontal bone loss, accompanied by elevated expression of proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin-1Î², interleukin-6 and interleukin-17A) and higher numbers of oral bacteria. In contrast to the results in humans, in which periodontitis susceptibility is also influenced by confounding gender-related behaviors, in the murine oral gavage model and ligature model, female mice appear to be more susceptible to periodontal bone loss than male mice. In the ligature model, we observed significantly (pÂ <Â 0.05) higher CEJ-ABC distance, gingival proinflammatory cytokine production and number of oral bacteria in female mice. Furthermore, our results imply that female mice develop periodontitis with a higher progression rate. Our study has therefore established that animal models can be used to dissect the mechanisms underlying genuine gender-based differences in periodontal disease susceptibility and/or progression.

Stonefish envenomation with acute carpal tunnel syndrome. Stonefish envenomation is a common marine sting. Although stonefish injuries are commonly sustained during maritime activities, this local delicacy can also be considered a regional occupational hazard for chefs. The availability and consumption of stonefish in local restaurants has increased the risk of acute carpal tunnel syndrome after a stonefish injury. This case report describes acute carpal tunnel syndrome following stonefish envenomation. An excellent recovery was achieved after surgical decompression of the carpal tunnel syndrome. Standard management of stonefish injuries should therefore take into account the possibility that this orthopaedic emergency may complicate the injury.

[Utility of the detection of nasal flaring in the assessment of severity of dyspnea]. To determine if the presence of nasal flaring is indicative of severe respiratory insufficiency. Prospective observational study of patients consulting in the Emergency Department because of dyspnea whose triage level is II or III in the Spanish Triage System (MAT-SET). Vital signs, SpO2, arterial blood gases and nasal flaring presence were recorded, as well as the need for hospital admission and length of hospital stay. Data are presented as median (25-75th percentile). A total of 43 patients were analyzed (70% men, aged 77 (67-82) years), 7 of whom showed nasal flaring. Those having flaring had higher respiratory rate (36 (34-40) vs. 25 (20-28) vs., p=0.001) and were more acidotic (pH 7.34 [7.23-7.40] vs. 7.42 [7.39-7.46] vs., p=0.03) than patients without this sign. There were no differences between groups in SpO2, PaCO2, heart rate and arterial pressure. There were no differences in the rate of hospital admission-(6 patients [85.7%] in nasal flaring group vs 29 patients [80.5%] in the non nasal flaring group [p=0,06], or in the length of the hospital stay-3 days [1-16] in nasal flaring group vs. 6 days [1-10] in the non nasal flaring group, p=0.6). All patients with nasal flaring had tachypnea. In our study, nasal flaring does not indicate severity in dyspneic patients in spite of its association with tachypnea and acidosis.

Paediatric and adolescent sport injury in the wilderness. Participation in backcountry wilderness recreation has increased in recent years with children and adolescents making up an increasing number of participants visiting wilderness destinations. Engaging in wilderness activity involves the risk of injury, illness and even death. Unfortunately, there is very little research investigating the health challenges facing children and adolescents in the wilderness. With the intent of increasing awareness among the sports medicine community, this review examines reported paediatric and adolescent wilderness injuries reported in the state of Washington and in US National Parks, injuries reported during outdoor wilderness programmes and global youth expeditions, and health challenges in wilderness settings where the threat of acute mountain sickness is elevated. Future studies addressing the challenges of establishing numerator data linked to suitable denominator data and monitoring injured and non-injured children and adolescents in the wilderness are recommended.

Salt-Rich Selenium for Prevention and Control Children with Kashin-Beck Disease: a Meta-analysis of Community-Based Trial. Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) in western China is not well controlled. The objective of this study is to evaluate prevention and control children with KBD through a meta-analysis of a community-based trial. Web of knowledge, PubMed, Elsevier, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), VIP and Wanfang data had been electronically searchedÂ up to February 2015. Search terms included the trial terms "Salt rich selenium" and "Kashin-Beck disease." Eligible studies were prospective trials of salt-rich selenium in endemic villages. Data extraction was performed by two authors using predefined data fields that also included quality evaluation. Of 292 potentially relevant articles initially screened, reporting 11 community-based trials with a total enrollment of 2652 participants were included, from five provinces in China. The pooled odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) of primary prevention in healthy children were 0.16 and 0.08â¼0.33, respectively. The OR and 95Â % CI of clinical improvement in KBD children were 6.57 and 3.33â¼12.93, respectively. The OR of repairing rate of metaphysis lesions was 5.53 (95Â % CI 2.92â¼10.47) based on X-ray film, which was statistically significantly different in favor of salt-rich selenium. The combined standard mean difference (SMD) of selenium content in hair was 2.54 (95Â % CI 1.21â¼3.87) which was significantly higher in selenium group. Current evidence showed that supplement salt-rich selenium was effective in reducing new incidence in healthy children and clinical improvement including repairing metaphysis lesions instead of repairing distal end of phalanx lesions in KBD children.

Identifying clinically questionable psychotropic prescribing practices for medicaid recipients in new york state. This study sought to identify and characterize rates of clinically questionable prescribing in New York State. As part of a quality improvement initiative, 34 national psychopharmacology experts identified a set of questionable prescribing practices recognizable from pharmacy claims data. Indicators of such practices were applied to Medicaid claims data for 217,216 beneficiaries in New York State who had an active psychotropic prescription on April 1, 2008. A total of 156,103 (72%) of these beneficiaries had one or more continuing (>90 days) prescriptions for a psychotropic. About 10% of adults were prescribed four or more psychotropics concurrently, and 13% of children and 2% of older adults were prescribed three or more concurrently. Prescribing an antipsychotic with a moderate-to-high risk of causing metabolic abnormalities approached 50% (46%) among individuals who had existing cardiometabolic conditions. Among beneficiaries prescribed second-generation antipsychotics with a moderate-to-high risk of causing metabolic abnormalities, over half (60%) had not received a metabolic screening test in the past year. Among women of reproductive age prescribed mood stabilizers, over one-quarter (30%) were prescribed a valproic acid-based formulation despite its potential for teratogenicity. Only 2% of youths under age 18 were prescribed benzodiazepines; however, about half (48%) had trials over 90 days' duration. Examination of pharmacy claims from Medicaid beneficiaries in New York State indicated that prescribing practices deemed clinically questionable by pharmacology experts are common. Aggregated pharmacy claims data can identify such practices, and reviews of these data can be a core component of efforts to improve prescribing practices.

Effects of Physical Environment on Health and Behaviors of Residents With Dementia in Long-Term Care Facilities: A Longitudinal Study.

Spatial analysis of uterine EMG signals: evidence of increased in synchronization with term. Evaluation of synchronization between signals can give new insights into the functioning of the related systems. Methods that can detect synchronization or coupling between signals can be divided two types: linear and non linear methods. In this paper we use the non linear correlation coefficient (h(2)) to show the difference in synchronization between efficient uterine contractions during labor and normal physiological contractions during pregnancy, in uterine activity bursts recorded at different places on the pregnant abdomen. Our interest in the non linear correlation coefficient is based on the fact that the propagation mechanism of uterine EMG signal may be strongly non linear. The results obtained from estimating the synchronization between 16 uterine EMG channels indicate that synchronization between contractions as measured by h(2) is stronger in labor than in pregnancy. Limited data indicates that the h(2) value increases markedly with term when expressed in duration before spontaneous labor.

Involvement of Rho-kinase in collar-induced vasoconstriction and vascular hypersensitivity to serotonin in rat carotid. Vasoconstriction and vascular hypersensitivity to serotonin has been described previously in animal models of adventitia injury. The present study was undertaken to investigate the contribution of the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway to the collar-induced the change of vascular contractility and reactivity in rat carotid artery. Wistar Kyoto rats were assigned to 4 treatments (n=12): vehicle, fasudil, valsartan, and fasudil plus valsartan. After 1 week of treatment, adventitia injury was induced by positioning a silicone collar around the right carotid artery for 1 week. Blood flow and vascular reactivity to serotonin was determined 1 week after injury, and carotids were harvested for morphometry and biochemical analysis. Adventitia injury leaded to histological changes of vasoconstriction with the percent lumen patency of 54.5 Â± 4.3% (p<0.001) decreasing, accompanying by the reduction of the blood flow (2.79 Â± 0.22 ml/min vs. 3.67 Â± 0.26 mi/min/p<0.001) when compared to contralateral arteries. The increase of vascular reactivity sensitivity to serotonin was observed in the collared artery when compared with the contralateral artery. Treatment with valsartan and fasudil prevented the development of vasoconstriction, improved the carotid blood flow and normalized the hypersensitivity to serotonin. Injury increased Angiotensin II type 1(AT(1)receptor, Rho-kinase, and p-MYPT1(Thr696) expression. Valsartan lowered the Rho-kinase and p-MYPT1(Thr696) expression. Fasudil inhibited the p-MYPT1(Thr696) expression. Collar-induced adventitia injury resulted in the enhancement of vascular contractility and reactivity. The activation of RhoA/Rho-kinase signal pathway, stimulated by AT(1) receptor, plays an important role in the collar-induced the change of vascular contractility and reactivity.

Negative regulation of TLR4 via targeting of the proinflammatory tumor suppressor PDCD4 by the microRNA miR-21. The tumor suppressor PDCD4 is a proinflammatory protein that promotes activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and suppresses interleukin 10 (IL-10). Here we found that mice deficient in PDCD4 were protected from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced death. The induction of NF-kappaB and IL-6 by LPS required PDCD4, whereas LPS enhanced IL-10 induction in cells lacking PDCD4. Treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells with LPS resulted in lower PDCD4 expression, which was due to induction of the microRNA miR-21 via the adaptor MyD88 and NF-kappaB. Transfection of cells with a miR-21 precursor blocked NF-kappaB activity and promoted IL-10 production in response to LPS, whereas transfection with antisense oligonucleotides to miR-21 or targeted protection of the miR-21 site in Pdcd4 mRNA had the opposite effect. Thus, miR-21 regulates PDCD4 expression after LPS stimulation.


Effect of episodic hypoxia on the susceptibility to hypocapnic central apnea during NREM sleep.

Effect of dietary lipid, carnitine and exercise on lipid profile in rat blood, liver and muscle. Aim of this study was to investigate the influence of physical exercise on effects of the daily intake of vegetarian diet of either vegetable hydrogenated fat (HF) or peanut oil (PO) with or without carnitine on the lipid profile. Eight groups of male Wistar rats were fed HF-diet (4 groups) or PO-diet (4 groups), with or without carnitine for 24 weeks. One group for each diet acted as sedentary control while the other groups were allowed swimming for 1 hr a day, 6 days/week, for 24 weeks. Plasma triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol, free fatty acids (FFA), liver and thigh muscle glycogen, total fat (TF), TG, TC and FFA were analyzed. HF-fed rats showed significantly increased plasma TC, VLDL+LDL-cholesterol and TG compared to PO-fed rats, wherein a lowered plasma TC, TG levels in all the groups with significantly increased liver cholesterol and decreased muscle cholesterol was observed. Physical exercise of moderate intensity reduced plasma TC and TG accompanied by significantly reduced tissue TG and cholesterol while FFA and glycogen increased in all the groups. The influence of exercise was less pronounced in carnitine supplemented rats since carnitine could significantly reduce TG in plasma and tissues of sedentary rats. Results from the present study showed that the intake of HF diet significantly increased the plasma and tissue lipid profile and MUFA-rich diet or carnitine supplementation and/or exercise may ameliorate the deleterious effects of HF.

Pharyngeal airway volume and shape from cone-beam computed tomography: relationship to facial morphology. The aim of this study was to assess the differences in airway shape and volume among subjects with various facial patterns. Cone-beam computed tomography records of 62 nongrowing patients were used to evaluate the pharyngeal airway volume (superior and inferior compartments) and shape. This was done by using 3-dimensional virtual surface models to calculate airway volumes instead of estimates based on linear measurements. Subgroups of the sample were determined by anteroposterior jaw relationships and vertical proportions. There was a statistically significant relationship between the volume of the inferior component of the airway and the anteroposterior jaw relationship (P = 0.02), and between airway volume and both size of the face and sex (P = 0.02, P = 0.01). No differences in airway volumes related to vertical facial proportions were found. Skeletal Class II patients often had forward inclination of the airway (P <0.001), whereas skeletal Class III patients had a more vertically oriented airway (P = 0.002). Airway volume and shape vary among patients with different anteroposterior jaw relationships; airway shape but not volume differs with various vertical jaw relationships. The methods developed in this study make it possible to determine the relationship of 3-dimensional pharyngeal airway surface models to facial morphology, while controlling for variability in facial size.

Inhibition of tissue factor/protease-activated receptor-2 signaling limits proliferation, migration and invasion of malignant glioma cells. Tissue factor (TF) is upregulated in several malignant diseases, including gliomas. Here, we demonstrate pronounced differences in the expression of TF and its interactors factor VII and protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR-2) in nine human glioma cell lines (U87, U251, U343, U373, MZ-18, MZ-54, MZ-256, MZ-304, Hs 683) as detected by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Inhibition of TF signaling by a neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb TF9-10H10) led to significantly reduced proliferation in high-grade astroglial (MZ-18 and MZ-304) and oligodendroglial (Hs 683) cell lines abundantly expressing TF, but not in U373 cells expressing low amounts of TF. Scratch migration assays and Boyden chamber assays indicated that mAb TF9-10H10 and lentiviral knockdown of TF significantly reduced cell migration and invasion of MZ-18, MZ-304 and Hs 683 cells, both under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. Of note, all three cell lines displayed increased cell migration and invasion under hypoxic conditions (1% O(2)), which was associated with enhanced expression of TF and increased phosphorylation of p44/42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2). Silencing of TF blocked activation of the ERK pathway, induction of TF expression and the potentiating effect of hypoxia on cell migration and invasion. RNA interference against PAR-2 abrogated the autocrine effects of TF on cell proliferation, migration and invasion, indicating that TF signals via PAR-2 in glioma cells. Our results suggest an important role for the TF/FVIIa/PAR-2/ERK axis in tumor growth and invasion of glioma and suggest that TF may be a suitable target for the development of novel therapies against high-grade glioma.


A genome-wide analysis of array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data to detect intra-species variations and evolutionary relationships.

Allele-specific CDH1 downregulation and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC) is an autosomal dominant cancer susceptibility syndrome characterized by early-onset diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) and lobular breast cancer. E-cadherin (CDH1) heterozygous germline mutations and deletions are found in 40% of families. Independent of CDH1 alterations, most HDGC tumours display mislocalized or absent E-cadherin immunoexpression, therefore undetected defects at the CDH1 locus may still be involved. We aimed at determining whether CDH1 mutation-negative probands display germline CDH1 allele-specific expression (ASE) imbalance, using a single-nucleotide primer extension-based procedure and tried to uncover the underlying molecular defect. CDH1 ASE analysis was performed using three intragenic SNPs in RNA extracted from the blood of 21 cancer-free individuals and 22 HDGC probands (5 CDH1 mutation carriers and 17 CDH1 negative). Germline promoter methylation, deletions and haplotype-related susceptibility at the CDH1 locus were analysed. Both CDH1 alleles from cancer-free individuals displayed equivalent expression levels, whereas monoallelic CDH1 expression or high allelic expression imbalance (AI) was present in 80% of CDH1 mutant and 70.6% (n = 12) of CDH1-negative HDGC probands. Germline deletions and promoter hypermethylation were found in 25% of probands displaying high CDH1 AI. No particular haplotype was found to be associated with CDH1 high AI. Germline CDH1 AI is highly frequent among CDH1 mutation-negative probands but was not seen in cancer-free individuals. This implicates the CDH1 locus in the majority of mutation-negative HDGC families.


[Determination of phosphate, pyrophosphate, metaphosphate and total phosphorus in seafoods by ion chromatography].

Interpreting diffuse reflectance for in vivo skin reactions in terms of chromophores. The measurement and quantification of skin reactions to insults involves certain assumptions about the relation between intensity of color appearance of the skin and the concentration of endogenous chromophores. The underlying assumption is that the Beer-Lambert law is obeyed, i.e., that a linear relation exists between the absorbance and the concentration of each chromophore and that the total absorbance is the linear superposition of the contributions of each chromophore. In this paper the authors compiled the results from a number of interventions on human skin that result in changes in its appearance and small deviations from the homeostatic state, where the results may be accounted for by a single or multiple chromophores. The validity of the assumptions is found to hold for a limited range of responses. The biological constraints need to be considered in certain cases because as we move away from the homeostatic state, complex biological processes are induced.

Evaluation of a fiber-optic esophageal pulse oximeter. A dual-wavelength fiber-optic pulse oximetry system was developed for the purposes of estimating oxygen saturation from the esophagus. A probe containing miniature right-angled glass prisms was used to record photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals from the esophageal wall. Signals were recorded successfully in 19 of 20 patients, demonstrating that PPG signals could be reliably obtained from an internal vascularized tissue site such as the esophageal epithelium. The value of the mean oxygen saturation recorded from the esophagus was 94.0 +/- 4.0%. These results demonstrate that SpO(2) may be estimated in the esophagus using a fiber-optic probe and this may be the first report of such measurements.

Low-complexity video compression for capsule endoscope based on compressed sensing theory. Recently, the notions of Compressed Sensing (CS) have attracted attention as an innovative concept in signal processing. In this exploratory paper, a CS-based video compression approach suitable for wireless capsule endoscopy is proposed. In general, the amount of video data generated by capsule endoscopy is so large that video compression is the best way to lower the communication bandwidth and save the RF transmitting power. However, due to power limitation and small size conditions, traditional video compression techniques are not appropriate. Applying state-of-the-art CS theory may significantly reduce power consumption and memory of video compressor, thanks to its low computational complexity. The proposed approach is based on YUV color space conversion, blocking, zigzag scan and CS measuring. Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed idea and that future improving works are necessary.

Mechanoluminescence properties of SrAl2O4:Eu(2+) phosphor by combustion synthesis. In this paper, europium-doped strontium aluminate (SrAl2O4:Eu(2+)) phosphors were synthesized using a combustion method with urea as a fuel at 600Â°C. The phase structure, particle size, surface morphology and elemental analysis were studied using X-ray diffractometry (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra. The EDX and FTIR spectra confirm the elements present in the SrAl2O4:Eu(2+) phosphor. The optical properties of SrAl2O4:Eu(2+) phosphors were investigated by photoluminescence (PL) and mechanoluminescence (ML). The excitation and emission spectra showed a broad band with peaks at 337 and 515 nm, respectively. The ML intensities of SrAl2O4:Eu(2+) phosphor increased proportionally with the increase in the height of the mechanical load, which suggests that this phosphor could be used in stress sensors. The CIE colour chromaticity diagram and ML spectra confirm that the SrAl2O4:Eu(2+) phosphor emitted green coloured light.

Is the Risk Difference Really a More Heterogeneous Measure? There are claims in the literature that the risk difference is a more heterogeneous measure than the odds ratio or risk ratio. These claims are based on surveys of meta-analyses showing that tests reject the null hypothesis of homogeneity more often for the risk difference than for the ratio measures. Discussions of this point have neglected the fact that homogeneity tests can have different levels of statistical power (i.e., different probabilities of rejecting the null when it is false) across different scales. We give hypothetical examples in which there is arguably equal heterogeneity across risk difference and odds ratio measures but in which the risk difference homogeneity test rejects more often, and therefore has higher power, than the odds ratio homogeneity test. These examples suggest that current empirical evidence for the claim that the risk difference is more heterogeneous is not at present satisfactory. Further research could consider other approaches to empirical comparisons of the heterogeneity of the three measures. 

Influence of procedural learning on Iowa Gambling Task performance among HIV+ individuals with history of substance dependence. HIV+ individuals have been shown to demonstrate deficits on the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a complex measure of "decision-making." Little remains known about what other neurocognitive processes may account for variability in IGT performance among HIV+ samples or the role of procedural learning (PL) in IGT performance. A sample of 49 HIV+ individuals with a history of substance use disorders was examined to explore the relationship between IGT performance and three measures of PL: The Rotary Pursuit, Mirror Star Tracing, and Weather Prediction tasks. We found no statistically significant relationships between IGT performance and any of the PL tasks, despite finding significant correlations among the PL tasks. This pattern of results persisted when analyzing IGT performance in various ways (e.g., performance on earlier trial blocks or impairment classifications). Although other nondeclarative processes (e.g., somatic markers) may be important for IGT performance, these findings do not support PL as an important component neurocognitive process for the IGT. Similarly, these results suggest that differences in PL performance does not account for the decision-making deficits or variability in performances observed on the IGT among HIV+ individuals with a history of substance dependence.

The neuro-robotics paradigm: NEURARM, NEUROExos, HANDEXOS. This work describes the neuro-robotics paradigm: the fusion of neuroscience and robotics. The fusion of neuroscience and robotics, called neuro-robotics, is fundamental to develop robotic systems to be used in functional support, personal assistance and neuro-rehabilitation. While usually the robotic device is considered as a "tool" for neuroscientific studies, a breakthrough is obtained if the two scientific competences and methodologies converge to develop innovative platforms to go beyond robotics by including novel models to design better robots. This paper describes three robotic platforms developed at the ARTS lab of Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, implementing neuro-robotic design paradigm.

An Adolescent Case of Citrin Deficiency With Severe Anorexia Mimicking Anorexia Nervosa. We report a 12-year-old female citrin-deficient patient presenting with severe anorexia and body weight loss, mimicking the restricting type of anorexia nervosa (AN). She showed normal development until age 10 years when she started to play volleyball at school. She then became gradually anorexic, and her growth was stunted. At age 12, she was admitted to hospital because of severe anorexia and thinness. She was first thought to have AN, and drip infusion of glucose solution and high-calorie drinks were given, but her condition deteriorated further. She had a history of neonatal hepatitis and was therefore suspected to have citrin deficiency (CD). Genetic analysis of SLC25A13 revealed that she was compound heterozygous for 851del4 and IVS16ins3kb, and a diagnosis of CD was made. A low-carbohydrate diet with oral intake of arginine and ursodeoxycholic acid was started, and her condition gradually improved. The clinical features in our patient were similar to those of AN, and therefore AN may also be an important clinical sign in adolescent patients with CD.

Peri-operative evaluation by holter in elderly patients submitted to prostatectomy. Male patients, aged over 65 years and with no history of heart disease, need the following tests as a preoperative evaluation: blood count, electrocardiogram and X-ray of the chest. To verify the presence of ischemic and heart rate changes and the impact of the anesthetic procedure on these patients. Also to verify, in this population, the value of continuous ambulatory monitoring as a preoperative evaluation, a procedure that is not recommended by current guidelines. In this protocol, we used continuous ambulatory monitoring (Holter System), in the perioperative period of 30 patients, aged over 65 years, who underwent transurethral resection of the prostate under spinal anesthesia. In the preoperative and transoperative evaluations, frequent complex ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias were observed, and also ischemic changes. In the transoperative recording, the patients who had ischemic episodes were the same ones who showed total ischemic burden of more than 60 minutes in the preoperative recording. Ambulatory monitoring is not regarded as an appropriate procedure for the screening of myocardial ischemia, due to the characteristics and technical limitations of the method, especially in populations with a low prevalence of coronary disease. In this cross-sectional and observational study, we concluded that the Holter recordings provided additional information which could not be obtained by conventional electrocardiogram.


Self-rated health and associated factors, Brazil, 2006.

Folate receptor beta is expressed by tumor-associated macrophages and constitutes a marker for M2 anti-inflammatory/regulatory macrophages. Macrophage activation comprises a continuum of functional states critically determined by cytokine microenvironment. Activated macrophages have been functionally grouped according to their response to pro-Th1/proinflammatory stimuli [lipopolysaccharide, IFNgamma, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF); M1] or pro-Th2/anti-inflammatory stimuli [interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, M-CSF; M2]. We report that folate receptor beta (FRbeta), encoded by the FOLR2 gene, is a marker for macrophages generated in the presence of M-CSF (M2), but not GM-CSF (M1), and whose expression correlates with increased folate uptake ability. The acquisition of folate uptake ability by macrophages is promoted by M-CSF, maintained by IL-4, prevented by GM-CSF, and reduced by IFNgamma, indicating a link between FRbeta expression and M2 polarization. In agreement with in vitro data, FRbeta expression is detected in tumor-associated macrophages (TAM), which exhibit an M2-like functional profile and exert potent immunosuppressive functions within the tumor environment. FRbeta is expressed, and mediates folate uptake, by CD163(+) CD68(+) CD14(+) IL-10-producing TAM, and its expression is induced by tumor-derived ascitic fluid and conditioned medium from fibroblasts and tumor cell lines in an M-CSF-dependent manner. These results establish FRbeta as a marker for M2 regulatory macrophage polarization and indicate that folate conjugates of therapeutic drugs are a potential immunotherapy tool to target TAM.

Infectious granulomatous dermatitis associated with Rothia mucilaginosa bacteremia: A case report. Infections with rare pathogens are being recognized with increasing frequency in severely immunocompromised patients. As a result of these patients' underlying compromised defenses and susceptibility to atypical organisms, tissue biopsies from patients within this population may demonstrate nonclassical histopathological findings. Here, we describe an unusual granulomatous reaction to gram-positive cocci in the skin of a 52-year-old man undergoing salvage chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia. The patient presented with a papular eruption on the arms, trunk, and face and fever; concomitant blood cultures were positive for Rothia mucilaginosa and Streptococcus salivarius. Histologic evaluation revealed a granulomatous dermatitis associated with numerous small, round, predominantly intracellular bacteria. Classically, cutaneous infiltrates associated with coccoid bacterial infections are suppurative and not granulomatous. The intracellular organisms stained positive for Gram, periodic acid-Schiff, and Grocott methenamine silver stains, suggestive of R. mucilaginosa. Rothia mucilaginosa, a component of the oral flora, was first reported as a human pathogen in 1978. Although the majority of cases in the literature have described R. mucilaginosa bacteremia, other reported manifestations include meningitis, endocarditis, pneumonia, osteomyelitis, and peritonitis. To our knowledge, however, only 1 prior report has described a cutaneous manifestation of R. mucilaginosa septicemia, which occurred in a patient with neutropenia. This is the second reported case of an infectious granulomatous dermatitis associated with R. mucilaginosa bacteremia and raises awareness of this unusual histopathological presentation in the setting of a bacterial infection affecting the skin.

A novel type of glial cell in the retina is stimulated by insulin-like growth factor 1 and may exacerbate damage to neurons and MÃ¼ller glia. Recent studies have demonstrated that insulin can have profound affects on the survival of neurons within the retina. The purpose of this study was to determine how insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) influences retinal cells; in particular, the glial cells. We identify a novel type of glial cell in the avian retina and provide evidence that these cells can respond to acute damage and IGF1. In normal retinas, we found a distinct cell-type, scattered across the ganglion cell and inner plexiform layers that express Sox2, Sox9, Nkx2.2, vimentin, and transitin, the avian homologue of mammalian nestin. These glial cells have a unique immunohistochemical profile, morphology, and distribution that are distinct among other known types of retinal glia, including microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and Muller glia. We termed these cells nonastrocytic inner retinal glia-like (NIRG) cells. We found that the NIRG cells may express the IGF1 receptor and respond to IGF1 by proliferating, migrating distally into the retina, and upregulating transitin. In addition, IGF1 stimulated microglia to become reactive and upregulate lysosomal membrane glycoprotein and CD45. With microglia and NIRG cells stimulated by IGF1 there were elevated levels of cell death and numerous focal detachments across the retina in response to excitotoxic damage. Cell death was prominent within the areas of detachment coinciding with a stark loss of MÃ¼ller glia and accumulation of NIRG cells. We conclude that NIRG cells are a novel type of retinal glia that is sensitive to IGF1 and whose activity may impact the survival of neurons and MÃ¼ller glia.

Rapid intraoperative tissue expansion with Foley catheter in a challenging cripple Hypospadias. Failed hypospadiass cases may result in hypovascular, scarred penis with residual penile chordee and leave the patient with minimal residual skin for penile resurfacing and urethroplasty. Local tissue expansion has become a good alternative to provide skin for penis by using expanders however they require long periods of time for expansion. Besides, rapid tissue expansion was also described in different tissues.We used rapid intraoperative expansion technique by using a Foley catheter in a failed hypospadias case who had minimal residual skin secondary to infection and we concluded that rapid intraoperative tissue expansion with Foley catheter is an effective, feasible reconstructive method for easy dissection and penile resurfacing in failed hypospadiass cases. 

Performance of an influenza rapid test in children in a primary healthcare setting in Nicaragua. Influenza is major public health threat worldwide, yet the diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests in developing country settings is not well described. To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the QuickVue Influenza A+B test in a primary care setting in a developing country, we performed a prospective study of diagnostic accuracy of the QuickVue Influenza A+B test in comparison to reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a primary healthcare setting in children aged 2 to 12 years in Managua, Nicaragua. The sensitivity and specificity of the QuickVue test compared to RT-PCR were 68.5% (95% CI 63.4, 73.3) and 98.1% (95% CI 96.9, 98.9), respectively, for children with a fever or history of a fever and cough and/or sore throat. Test performance was found to be lower on the first day that symptoms developed in comparison to test performance on days two or three of illness. Our study found that the QuickVue Influenza A+B test performed as well in a developing country primary healthcare facility setting as in developed country settings.

Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: Arthroscopic Management for Extreme Soft-Tissue Hip Instability. To present outcomes in a series of patients with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS)-hypermobility type who underwent hip arthroscopy for associated hip pain and extreme capsular laxity. A retrospective chart review identified 16 hips with confirmed EDS--hypermobility type that underwent hip arthroscopy for continued pain and capsular laxity. All patients had complaints of "giving way" and pain, an easily distractible hip with manual traction under fluoroscopy, and a patulous capsule at the time of surgery. No patient had osseous evidence of acetabular hip dysplasia or prior confirmed hip dislocation. Outcomes were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively with the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), and a visual analog scale (VAS) for pain. Evidence of symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) was found in 15 hips (93.8%). The 16th hip had subjective giving way with a positive anterior impingement test and was easily distractible, had a labral tear, and had a patulous capsule at the time of surgery. The mean follow-up period was 44.61 months (range, 12 to 99 months). The mean preoperative lateral center-edge angle was 31.8Â° (range, 25Â° to 44Â°), and the mean TÃ¶nnis angle was 3.6Â° (range, -2Â° to 8Â°). Mean femoral version measured on computed tomography (CT) scans was 19.2Â° (range, -4.0Â° to 31.0Â°). Of the hips, 13 underwent primary arthroscopy and 3 underwent revision. All hips underwent hip arthroscopy with an interportal capsular cut only and arthroscopic capsular plication. There were 13 labral repairs, 2 labral debridements, 8 rim resections, 15 femoral resections, 2 psoas tenotomies, and 1 microfracture. Improved stability with an inability to distract the hip with manual traction under fluoroscopy was noted in all hips after plication. The mean alpha angle preoperatively was 58.7Â° on anteroposterior radiographs and 63.6Â° on lateral radiographs compared with 47.4Â° and 46.1Â°, respectively, postoperatively. There were significant improvements for all outcomes (mHHS, P = .002; SF-12 score, P = .027; and VAS score, P = .0004). The mean mHHS, SF-12 score, and VAS score were 45.6 points, 62.4 points, and 6.5 points, respectively, preoperatively compared with 88.5 points, 79.3 points, and 1.6 points, respectively, at a mean follow-up of 45 months. No EDS patients were lost to follow-up or excluded from analysis. The mean improvement in mHHS from preoperatively to postoperatively was 42.9 points, and there were no iatrogenic dislocations. One patient underwent further revision arthroscopy for recurrent pain, subjective giving way, and capsular laxity. FAI and extreme capsular laxity can be seen in the setting of EDS. Although increased femoral version was common, acetabular dysplasia was not common in our study. Meticulous capsular plication, arthroscopic correction of FAI when present, and labral preservation led to dramatic improvements in outcomes and subjective stability without any iatrogenic dislocations in this potentially challenging patient population. Level IV, therapeutic case series.

[Efficacy and Safety of the Selective Estrogen Receptor Down-Regulator "Fulvestrant" in Japanese Patients with Advanced, Recurrent, ER-Positive Postmenopausal Breast Cancer]. Fulvestrant is a novel endocrine therapy for breast cancer that exerts both anti-estrogenic and down-regulatory effects by binding to and degrading estrogen receptors (ERs). In the present study, the safety and effectiveness of 500 mg fulvestrant in 69 patients with advanced, recurrent, ER-positive postmenopausal breast cancer were investigated retrospectively. Outcomes were favorable for fulvestrant. The objective response rate was 24.6%, the clinical benefit rate was 49.2%, the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 203 days, and the median overall survival was 794 days. PFS tended to be longer in patients without a history of previous treatment or visceral metastasis. The main adverse events included injection site reactions and hot flushes; however, the majority of these events were mild to moderate. The present findings suggest that, among Japanese patients with advanced, recurrent, ER-positive postmenopausal breast cancer, 500 mg fulvestrant is effective and safe in those without metastasis and a minimal history of receipt of previous treatment regimens.

The developmental profile: validation of a theory-driven instrument for personality assessment. The Developmental Profile is an instrument for personality assessment. It covers both maladaptive and adaptive characteristics. The current study examined its internal consistency and construct validity in a Dutch sample of 763 participants from various clinical and nonclinical settings. The internal consistency reliability estimates were good for the clusters of levels (adaptive, neurotic, and primitive), although not for all separate levels. Confirmatory factor analysis showed an overall good fit, with the exception of the level of primary narcissism. Furthermore, empirical evidence was found for the interpretation of a patient's Developmental Profile according to increasing levels of aggregation, with as a highest level a single maladaptivity-adaptivity scale score. This scale significantly distinguished among different patient groups.

Mild to moderate liver dysfunction does not require dose reduction of oral or intravenous vinorelbine: results of a pharmacokinetic study. We studied the pharmacokinetic profile of weekly oral and intravenous vinorelbine in cancer patients with various degrees of hepatic function, and assessed an intra-patient comparison of the pharmacokinetics of i.v. versus oral vinorelbine. In this open-label study, patients were randomised to receive an initial dose of vinorelbine at day 1 by either i.v. or the oral route followed by a second dose on day 8 via the alternative route. A total of 16 patients were included, 12 patients received the planned two administrations. Toxicities were similar for all cohorts and were mainly of haematological and gastrointestinal origin. Pharmacokinetic analysis of both routes did not reveal any differences between cohort I and II. Based on these findings in patients with mild to moderate liver dysfunction no dose modifications of vinorelbine have to be taken into consideration.

Morbidity and mortality after induction chemotherapy followed by surgery in IIIa-N2 non small cell lung cancer. To evaluate the frequency and risk of postoperative complications and mortality in patients with IIIa-N2 non small cell lung cancer after induction chemotherapy and surgery. In a surgical database records from ninety two patients, operated between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2006 were reviewed. Univariate analysis was used to identify predictors of postoperative complications and in-hospital mortality. All cases were histologically confirmed stage IIIa-N2. All patients received preoperative platinum based chemotherapy without radiotherapy. Pneumonectomy was performed in 20 cases (23.5%), from which 9 right sided. (Bi)lobectomy was performed in 53 cases (62.4%) and sleeve lobectomy in 11 cases (17.2%). One wedge resection was performed (1.2%). In 7 cases (7.6%) only an exploration was done. Complications developed in 35 patients (38%). Major complications in 15 patients (16%). No bronchopleural fistulae were observed. Analysis identified increased age and high physiological and operative severity score for the enumeration of mortality and morbidity (POSSUM) as a risk factor to develop complications, and a high simplified comorbidity score as a risk factor to develop a major complication. Higher age, Charlson comorbidity index, simplified comorbidity score and POSSUM were a risk factor for developing pneumonia. Although surgery after induction therapy for IIIa-N2 NSCLC can be done with a morbidity and mortality comparable to surgery alone, it remains a high risk operation. It should therefore be performed in a center with experience. Bronchial stump protection should be used whenever there is an increased risk for developing a bronchopleural fistula. In deciding whether to do surgery or radiotherapy one should keep in mind the feasibility of performing a complete resection together with a preoperative assessment to predict complications and mortality. For the preoperative assessment several scoring systems can be used from which we find the simplified comorbidity score most useful.

Evaluation of PET Imaging Performance of the TSPO Radioligand [18F]DPA-714 in Mouse and Rat Models of Cancer and Inflammation. Many radioligands have been explored for imaging the 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), a diagnostic and therapeutic target for inflammation and cancer. Here, we investigated the TSPO radioligand [(18)F]DPA-714 for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of cancer and inflammation. [(18)F]DPA-714 PET imaging was performed in 8 mouse and rat models of breast and brain cancer and 4 mouse and rat models of muscular and bowel inflammation. [(18)F]DPA-714 showed different uptake levels in healthy organs and malignant tissues of mice and rats. Although high and displaceable [(18)F]DPA-714 binding is observed ex vivo, TSPO-positive PET imaging of peripheral lesions of cancer and inflammation in mice did not show significant lesion-to-background signal ratios. Slower [(18)F]DPA-714 metabolism and muscle clearance in mice compared to rats may explain the elevated background signal in peripheral organs in this species. Although TSPO is an evolutionary conserved protein, inter- and intra-species differences call for further exploration of the pharmacological parameters of TSPO radioligands.

Personality traits associated with depressive and anxiety disorders in infertile women and men undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment. To assess which personality traits are associated with depressive and/or anxiety disorders in infertile women and men undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Prospective study. A university hospital in Sweden. A total of 856 eligible women and men, 428 couples, were approached to participate. Overall 643 (75.1%) subjects filled out the Swedish Universities Scales of Personality (SSP) questionnaire. The response rates were 323 women (75.5%) and 320 men (74.8%). The SSP, a self-rating personality trait questionnaire, was used for evaluation. Main outcome measures. Personality traits associated with depression and/or anxiety disorders. Higher mean scores on all neuroticism-related personality traits were found in women and men with depressive and/or anxiety disorders compared to women and men with no diagnosis. High scores of neuroticism and a negative pregnancy test after IVF were associated with depressive and/or anxiety disorders among women. Among men, high scores of neuroticism and unexplained or male infertility factor were associated with depressive and/or anxiety disorders. High neuroticism scores were negatively associated with live birth (p < 0.05). High scores on neuroticism-related personality traits were associated with depressive and/or anxiety disorders in women and men undergoing IVF.

Bone metastases are associated with considerable morbidity and can result in skeletal-related events (SREs), including pathologic fractures, the need for palliative radiotherapy, spinal cord compression, the need for surgery to bone to prevent or treat a pathologic fracture or spinal cord compression, and hypercalcemia of malignancy. Such SREs have been associated with decreases in survival and increases in healthcare costs. Skeletal morbidity and bone pain from metastases can also reduce patients' functional capacity and undermine their quality of life. Patients who develop bone metastases from advanced cancers commonly receive bisphosphonates to not only delay the onset of SREs and reduce their frequency but also provide clinically meaningful palliative effects for bone pain. Ongoing research may lead to improvements in skeletal health monitoring and management for patients with malignant bone disease.

Intermethod reliability and factors affecting recall with the Temple University Community Participation measure. Increased interest in promoting community inclusion of adults with serious mental illnesses will necessitate advances in measuring community participation as an outcome of such efforts. The primary aim of this study is to examine the intermethod reliability of the Temple University Community Participation (TUCP) measure with a daily checklist approach. Secondary aims are to explore the influence of frequency and importance of participation on recall consistency. One hundred and seven individuals diagnosed with a schizophrenia-spectrum disorder, bipolar disorder, or major depression completed a daily checklist of community participation in 25 areas. Approximately 30 days later they completed the TUCP measure involving recall of participation in these same areas. TUCP responses were highly correlated with totals from the daily checklists. Participation areas with more participation days have higher TUCP-diary checklist correlations. Importance of the participation area did not appear to affect correlations. The TUCP is a usable and relatively unobtrusive measure of community participation. Modest evidence found that more frequent events were recalled more consistently.

Risk factors and management patterns for emergency obstetric hysterectomy over 2 decades.

Anatomy of normal human anterior cruciate ligament attachments evaluated by divided small bundles. Double-bundle anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction has several potential advantages over single-bundle reconstruction with hamstring tendons. However, there are still controversies regarding tunnel placement in tibial and femoral attachments. The macroscopically normal ACL consists of small bundles about 1 mm in diameter. Detailed observation of the divided smaller bundles will achieve better understanding of the tunnel placement in anatomic ACL reconstruction. Descriptive laboratory study. This study used 20 cadaveric knees. The ACL was divided into anteromedial and posterolateral bundles, then separated into 10 small bundles of 2-mm diameters, with preservation of their attachment sites marked with color markers. The positional relationship between the femoral and tibial attachments of each small bundle was investigated. A layered positional correlation of small bundles was found between the tibial and femoral attachments. Small bundles aligned in the anterior-posterior direction in the tibia corresponded to the bundles aligned in a high-low direction in the femur in flexion. The femoral attachment pattern was relatively similar in each specimen; however, the tibial attachment showed 2 patterns: an oblique type (12 of 20) and a transverse type (8 of 20). The posterior portion of the posterolateral bundle was separately attached to the medial and lateral portions of the tibial attachment. There was no fibrous insertion in the center of the posterior portion of the ACL tibial attachment in any specimen. In this bare area, there was fat tissue and vascular bundles. Small bundles constituting the ACL showed a relatively layered arrangement between 2 attachments. The tibial attachment showed 2 patterns of oblique and transverse types, and the vascular bundles were located in the center of the posterolateral bundle. The results of this study of the normal ACL will provide insights for surgeons when placing grafts during anatomic ACL reconstruction.

Stimulation of glucose oxidase with white linearly polarized light. Glucose oxidase (GOD) was illuminated with white linearly polarized light (WLPL). The enzyme was illuminated at room temperature in separate vessels then admixed to a reactor filled with D-glucose. The illumination of the enzyme for 60 min at 25-30 degrees C and pH 6.5-7.0 provided its superior stimulation as proven in the oxidation of beta-D-glucose. Lyophilization of the illuminated enzyme reduced its activity by, approximately, 30%.

Application of contrast-enhanced constructive interference in steady state magnetic resonance imaging to Leksell GammaPlan for localizing c2-c3 aneurysms: technical note. We used gadolinium (Gd)-enhanced constructive interference in steady state (CISS) magnetic resonance imaging with the Leksell GammaPlan (LGP; Elekta AB, Stockholm, Sweden) system for accurate preoperative evaluation of the anatomic localization of intradural and/or extradural C2-C3 aneurysms. Anatomic localization of 8 unruptured aneurysms of the C2-C3 segment was evaluated using Gd-enhanced CISS imaging with LGP. Four patients diagnosed with intradural aneurysms, 1 with a combined intraextradural aneurysm, and 1 with an intracavernous aneurysm underwent operation. The aneurysmal localizations diagnosed preoperatively by Gd-enhanced CISS imaging with LGP were compared with intraoperative findings. By use of Gd-enhanced CISS imaging with LGP, 3-dimensional visualization of the internal carotid artery, aneurysms at the C2-C3 segment, optic nerve, oculomotor nerve, cavernous sinus, and anterior clinoid process was possible in 8 patients. The localization of intradural or combined intra-extradural aneurysms was diagnosed on the basis of the oculomotor nerve and the cavernous sinus depicted in 3-dimensional images. The oculomotor nerve and the cavernous sinus serve as landmarks for the proximal ring on images of the carotico-oculomotor membrane. Intradural or intra-extradural localization of C2-C3 aneurysms with this novel technique was in complete agreement with intraoperative findings in 6 surgical cases. This study demonstrated the utility of Gd-enhanced CISS imaging used with LGP for accurate preoperative localization of intradural and/or extradural aneurysms at the C2-C3 segments.


Cardiac adaptive responses after hypoxia in an experimental model.

Decreased expression of catechol-O-methyltransferase in the renal cortex of malignant spontaneously hypertensive rats. Essential hypertension is a disease of unknown pathogenesis, although renal function has been implicated as an important factor in its cause. Stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (SHRSP) rats provide an animal model of essential hypertension. To understand the cause of hypertension, identifying proteins that are differentially expressed between hypertensive and normotensive rats may provide a key. Here, proteins in the renal cortex from SHRSP rats, malignant stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive (M-SHRSP) rats, and Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats as a normotensive control were subjected to two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE). After in-gel digestion by trypsin, proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS). Several proteins showed differential expression patterns between hypertensive and normotensive rats. Among them, we focused on catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) because this enzyme inactivates catecholamines, possibly affecting blood pressure. To confirm the differential expression of COMT in each animal, we conducted Western blot analysis, which revealed that the expression of COMT is lower in M-SHRSP rats than in control and SHRSP rats, indicating that blood pressure and expression of COMT are related. In fact, the blood pressure of M-SHRSP rats was significantly higher than that of SHRSP rats at age of 10 weeks. Immunohistochemical and immunofluorescence studies showed that COMT in renal cortex is localized in tubular epithelial cells. The expression of COMT is lower in the renal cortex tubular epithelium of M-SHRSP rats than in normotensive rats. These results suggest that the decreased expression of COMT may be an important factor leading to the development of hypertension.

A 15-year population-based cohort study of the incidence of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies in an elderly French cohort. To provide global and age-related incidence over 65 years of Parkinsonian syndromes (PS), Parkinson's disease (PD) and suspected dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). A 15-year prospective population-based elderly cohort study in South-Western France (PAQUID). Incidences found were: 557.7/100,000 person-years for PS, 263 per 100 000 person-years for PD and 112 per 100,000 person-years for suspected DLB. The incidence of all PS, PD and suspected DLB was greater in men. The age-specific incidence of PD decreased over 85, while that of DLB continuously increased, even in the oldest individuals. The authors provide new data on PD and suspected DLB incidence in a large population-based French cohort of subjects aged over 65 and followed up for 15 years. PD incidence decreased in the oldest old contrary to that of suspected DLB cases and Alzheimer's disease.

Fenugreek seeds reduce atherogenic diet-induced cholesterol gallstone formation in experimental mice. Dietary hypocholesterolemic adjuncts may have a beneficial role in the prevention and treatment of cholesterol gallstones (CGS). In this investigation, fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum) seed was evaluated for this potential on the experimental induction of CGS in laboratory mice. CGS was induced by maintaining mice on a lithogenic diet (0.5% cholesterol) for 10 weeks. Fenugreek seed powder was included at 5%, 10%, and 15% of this lithogenic diet. Dietary fenugreek significantly lowered the incidence of CGS in these mice; the incidence was 63%, 40%, and 10% in the 5%, 10%, and 15% fenugreek groups, respectively, compared with 100% in the lithogenic control. The antilithogenic influence of fenugreek is attributable to its hypocholesterolemic effect. Serum cholesterol level was decreased by 26%-31% by dietary fenugreek, while hepatic cholesterol was lowered by 47%-64% in these high cholesterol-fed animals. Biliary cholesterol was 8.73-11.2 mmol/L as a result of dietary fenugreek, compared with 33.6 mmol/L in high-cholesterol feeding without fenugreek. Cholesterol saturation index in bile was reduced to 0.77-0.99 in fenugreek treatments compared with 2.57 in the high-cholesterol group. Thus, fenugreek seed offers health-beneficial antilithogenic potential by virtue of its favourable influence on cholesterol metabolism.


Targeted individual prophylaxis offers superior risk stratification for cytomegalovirus reactivation after liver transplantation.

The uniform data system for medical rehabilitation: report of patients with stroke discharged from comprehensive medical programs in 2000-2007. To provide benchmarking information for a large national sample of patients receiving inpatient rehabilitation after a stroke. Analysis of secondary data from 893 medical rehabilitation facilities located in the United States and contributing information to the Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation from 2000 to 2007. Variables analyzed included demographic information (age, sex, marital status, race/ethnicity, prehospital living setting, and discharge setting), hospitalization information (length of stay, program interruptions, payer, event onset date, rehabilitation impairment group, International Classification of Diseases-9 codes for the admitting diagnosis, and comorbidities), and functional status information (FIM(R) instrument ["FIM"] ratings at admission and discharge, FIM efficiency, and FIM gain). Descriptive statistics revealed that the length of stay decreased from a mean of 19.6 (+/-12.8) days to 16.5 (+/-9.8) days during the 8-yr study period. FIM instrument admission and discharge ratings also decreased. Mean admission ratings decreased from 62.5 (+/-20.1) to 55.1 (+/-19.3), and mean discharge ratings decreased from 86.4 (+/-23.6) to 79.8 (+/-24.0). FIM change remained relatively stable; the mean for the entire sample was 23.9 (+/-14.8). The percent of persons discharged to the community ranged from 75.8% in 2000 to 69.3% in 2007. All results are likely affected by changes in the definition for program interruption and procedures for FIM data collection. Uniform Data System for Medical Rehabilitation data from persons with stroke receiving rehabilitation from 2000 to 2007 indicate patients are showing improvement in functional independence during their rehabilitation stay, and a large percentage are discharged to community settings.


The glycemic and peak incremental indices of honey, sucrose and glucose in patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus: effects on C-peptide level-a pilot study.

Development of a myoelectric control scheme based on a time delayed neural network. Presented in this work is a possible myoelectric control scheme for a rehabilitation robotic application. The control input is from a time delayed neural network (TDNN). The input to the TDNN is four electromyographic (EMG) signals associated with the movement of the elbow and shoulder joints. The output of the TDNN is the joint position of the elbow and the joint position of the shoulder in the sagittal plane. The results presented here show the possibility of controlling multiple degrees of freedom at once. Prior work has shown that the optimal delay for accurate position prediction from a TDNN was 875ms with a 125ms interval, but this work shows that a delay of 300ms and a 100ms interval achieves similar results. This points to the feasibility of a TDNN based control scheme.

Histologic evaluation of fresh human ovarian tissue before cryopreservation. Transplantation of cryopreserved tissue from patients with cancer may carry the risk of reactivation or redissemination of micrometastases. This prospective study was conducted to evaluate the potential involvement of micrometastases in ovarian tissue in cancer patients. Ovarian biopsies were collected from patients who underwent ovarian tissue cryopreservation, in our IVF unit before chemotherapy between 2000 and 2008. Indications for cryopreservation included breast cancer (n=13), osteosarcoma (n=13), hematologic malignancies (n=13), uterine cervix carcinoma (n=2), endometrial carcinoma (n=1), colon cancer (n=1), and brain medulloblastoma (n=1). The samples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, and examined histologically. Immunoperoxidase broad-spectrum cytokeratin staining was also performed on specimens from breast cancer patients. There were 44 patients (age range 5-40 yr) who yielded 40 specimens. No gross pathologic involvement was observed, and the histologic examination revealed normal histology with no evidence of metastases. Our findings showed that for the purpose of considering ovarian tissue cryopreservation in cancer patients, the likelihood of microscopic metastases within ovaries of normal appearance is apparently very low. Clarification of the actual risk of ovarian involvement and any subsequent risk of micrometastases and tumor reimplantation requires further investigation.


Biomarker detection in the integration of multiple multi-class genomic studies.

[Synergistic cytotoxicity effect of histone deacetylase inhibitor combined with paclitaxel on lung cancer cell lines and its mechanism]. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors can inhibit cell signal network function through decreasing expression of multiple genes and proteins, thus affect cell proliferation, survival and chemosensitivity. HDAC inhibitors combined with paclitaxel may enhance the inhibitory effect of drugs on lung cancer cells. This study was to observe the synergistic anti-proliferative effect of HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) combined with paclitaxel on lung cancer cell lines H322 and H1299, and to investigate its mechanism. H322 and H1299 cells were divided into control group, paclitaxel (TAX) group, TSA group, and combination group (TF group, TSA followed by paclitaxel). Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay. Cell cycle and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry. The protein expression levels of survivin, ERK, and PARP were determined by Western blot analysis. When combined with TSA, the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of paclitaxel decreased from (48.07+/-26.12) nmol/L to (6.34+/-5.72) nmol/L in H322 cells and from (110.6+/-38.7) nmol/L to (63.7+/-11.8) nmol/L in H1299 cells, with significant differences (P<0.05). Apoptosis rate of H322 cells was higher in the the TF group than in the TAX group(P<0.05). There were more necrosis cells in the TF group of H1299 cell line than in the other groups. pERK was up-regulated in the TAX group of H322 cell line. Expression of Survivin was up-regulated in the TAX group of two cells. Expressions of Survivin and pERK were down-regulated in the TSA and TF groups of two cell lines. Cleaved PARP was detected in the TAX and the TF groups of H322 cells, and its expression was significantly higher in the the TF group than in the TAX group. Cleaved PARP was not detected in each group of H1299 cells. TSA combined with paclitaxel has a synergistic cytotoxicity effect on lung cancer cell lines H322 and H1299 when the cells were treated with TSA followed by paclitaxel. The mechanism may be that TSA down-regulates the survivin high-expression induced by paclitaxel, and blocks pERK protein expression.

Toxaemia of pregnancy and risk of mortality in later life: evidence from the Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study. To examine whether toxaemia of pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of mortality, in particular premature death. A cohort nested within the Royal College of General Practitioners' Oral Contraception Study focusing on women who never used oral contraceptives. A total of 2865 parous women with a history of toxaemia of pregnancy were compared with 11,460 parous women without such a history. Adjusted hazards ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for death from all causes, vascular disease and cancer. Risk of premature death before the age of 65 years was compared between the two groups. Women with a history of toxaemia had a significant increased risk of death from any cause (adjusted HR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04-1.39) and from vascular disease (adjusted HR 1.38, 95% CI 1.05-1.82). Women with a history of toxaemia who did not subsequently develop hypertension or vascular disease had significantly increased risks of all-cause and vascular mortality. These risks were not found among women who developed these conditions. Toxaemia of pregnancy was not associated with premature death. Toxaemia of pregnancy was associated with increased mortality but not premature death.

Challenges to the provision of emergency obstetric care in Iraq. To assess the availability of, and challenges to the provision of emergency obstetric care in order to raise awareness and assist policy-makers and development partners in making appropriate decisions to help pregnant women in Iraq. Descriptive and exploratory study based on self-administered questionnaires, an in-depth interview and a Focus Group Discussion. The setting was 19 major hospitals in 8 out of the 18 Governorates and the participants were 31 Iraqi doctors and 1 midwife. The outcome measures were availability of emergency obstetric care (EOC) in hospitals and challenges to the provision of EOC. Only 26.3% (5/19) of hospitals had been able to provide all the 8 signal functions of comprehensive emergency obstetric care in the previous 3 months. All the 19 hospitals provided parenteral antibiotics and uterine evacuation, 94.7% (18/19) were able to provide parenteral oxytocics and perform manual removal of retained placenta, magnesium sulphate for eclampsia was available in 47.4% (9/19) of hospitals, 42.1% (8/19) provided assisted vaginal delivery, 26.5% (5/19) provided blood transfusion and 89.5% (17/19) offered Caesarean section. The identified challenges for health care providers include difficulties travelling to work due to frequent checkpoints and insecurity, high level of insecurity for patients referred or admitted to hospitals, inadequate staffing due mainly to external migration and premature deaths as a result of the war, lack of drugs, supplies and equipment (including blood for transfusion), and falling standards of training and regulation. Most women and their families do not currently have access to comprehensive emergency obstetric care. Health care providers recommend reconstruction and strengthening of all components of the Iraqi health system which may only be achieved if security returns to the country.

Frequency of tail loss does not reflect innate predisposition in temperate New Zealand lizards. Caudal autotomy (tail shedding) is a defence mechanism against predation which is used by lizards when other tactics, such as crypsis and escape, prove ineffective. The speed at which autotomy occurs has important implications for survival, and the accuracy of tail loss is of consequence for an individual's future fitness. Autotomy is shaped by both taxon-specific tail morphology as well as environmental factors such as predator history, and it can be difficult to distinguish between these processes. In this study, the frequency of tail-regeneration observed (field rate of autotomy), latency (speed of autotomy in the laboratory) and accuracy of tail loss were measured in six lizard species from two families (Scincidae and Diplodactylidae). The field rate and latency of autotomy was similar among all species except for the large nocturnal skink Oligosoma macgregori, which was less likely to autotomise. Latency and field rates of autotomy were not correlated, implying that the field rates of autotomy are related to predation attacks, social interactions, or some other environmental factor, rather than an innate disposition to autotomy. Further study, for example comparing populations with low and high predation pressure, will help to explain which of these factors are influencing autotomy rates.

Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis and genetic testing. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common spinal deformity affecting 2% of the population. Initial diagnosis is straightforward. Determining which curves will progress and warrant intervention is still problematic. Recent genetics research has discovered markers that are associated with progression to a severe curve, providing new information that can lead to more effective care with lower cost and fewer unnecessary radiographs and brace applications. Current family studies indicate that AIS is a polygenic disorder with multiple patterns of inheritance. Genetic markers have been identified that are related to AIS curve progression to a severity in which surgery is often performed (under review 2009). These genetic markers have been validated in white girls and boys but are not yet confirmed in Asians or African-Americans. These markers provide a basis for calculating the risk of progression in a score-based model, thus enabling personalized medical decisions. Further research following these discoveries may lead to an understanding of the underlying molecular biology of AIS. Genetic markers have been identified that are associated with progression to a severe curve in AIS patients. A risk of progression score can be calculated using these saliva-based DNA markers that risk stratifies patients on a scale of 1-200. This AIS progression test enables personalized medical decisions for treatment algorithms and improves the quality of care by allowing evidence-based management decisions.

Significance of the antiangiogenic mechanisms of thalidomide in the therapy of diabetic retinopathy. Diabetic retinopathy is an ocular complication associated with the chronic endocrine disorder of diabetes mellitus. Angiogenesis is adjudged as a prime modulatory event in this complication. The formation of new blood vessels on the pre-existing vasculature gives rise to an abundance of anatomical and physiological alterations which ultimately results in vision loss. The drastic consequences of this complication prompt the obligation of developing effective therapies for its cure. The existing therapy mainly includes destructive techniques such as laser photocoagulation. Owing to the various drawbacks associated with this technique, there is a need to develop alternative therapies which could halt the progression of diabetic retinopathy without causing considerable damage to the retinal cells. One such possible alternative treatment being researched upon is the antiangiogenic therapy. Since angiogenesis is a critical event during the progression of this disorder, targeting this event may perhaps prove effective in its treatment. Amongst several antiangiogenic agents, thalidomide holds a reputable position due to its effectiveness in terminating angiogenesis during various pathological conditions. This review focuses on the diverse molecular mechanisms proposed to explain the antiangiogenic properties of thalidomide and their applicability in diabetic retinopathy.

Self- and proxy reports of quality of life among adolescents living in residential youth care compared to adolescents in the general population and mental health services. Child welfare services are aimed at providing care and protection, fostering well-being and prosocial behaviour. Thus, Quality of Life (QoL) should be an important outcome measure in Residential Youth Care (RYC) institutions. However, the dearth of research in this area gives rise to serious concern. The present study is the first large scale, nationwide study assessing QoL among adolescents living in RYC. To provide a reference frame, adolescent self- and primary contact proxy reports were compared to the general population and to adolescent outpatients in Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service (CAMHS). Also, we investigated the association between self-report of QoL in adolescents living in RYC and proxy reports of their primary contacts at the institution. All residents between the ages of 12-23 years living in RYC in Norway were the inclusion criteria. Eighty-six RYC institutions (with 601 eligible youths) were included, 201 youths/ parents did not give their consent. Finally, 400 youths aged 12-20 years participated, yielding a response rate of 67%. As a reference frame for comparison, a general population (N = 1444) and an outpatient sample of adolescents in CAMHS (N = 68) were available. We used the Questionnaire for Measuring Health-related Quality of Life in Children and Adolescents (KINDL-R). General Linear Model analyses (ANCOVA) were conducted with five KINDL life domains as dependent variables and group as independent variable. Self- and proxy reports of QoL in adolescents living in RYC revealed a significantly (p < 0.001) poorer QoL compared to the general population on the life domains Physical- and Emotional well-being, Self-esteem, and relationship with Friends. Adolescents evaluated their physical well-being as worse compared to adolescents in CAHMS. Self- and proxy reports in RYC differed significantly on two of five life domains, but correlated low to moderate with each other. The results in this study raise major concerns about the poor QoL of the adolescents living in RYC, thereby challenging the child welfare system and decision makers to take action to improve the QoL of this group. The use of QoL as outcome measures is highly recommended.

LoMA-B: a simple and versatile lab-on-a-chip system based on single-channel bisulfite conversion for DNA methylation analysis. Miniaturized lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems have been developed for genetic and epigenetic analyses in clinical applications because of advantages such as reduced sample size and reagent consumption, rapid processing speed, simplicity, and enhanced sensitivity. Despite tremendous efforts made towards developing LOC systems for use in the clinical setting, the development of LOC systems to analyze DNA methylation, which is an emerging epigenetic marker causing the abnormal silencing of genes including tumor suppressor genes, is still challenging because of the gold standard methods involving a bisulfite conversion step. Existing bisulfite conversion-based techniques are not suitable for clinical use due to their long processing time, labor intensiveness, and the purification steps involved. Here, we present a lab-on-a-chip system for DNA methylation analysis based on bisulfite conversion (LoMA-B), which couples a sample pre-processing module for on-chip bisulfite conversion and a label-free, real-time detection module for rapid analysis of DNA methylation status using an isothermal DNA amplification/detection technique. The methylation status of the RARÎ² gene in human genomic DNA extracted from MCF-7 cells was analyzed by the LoMA-B system within 80 min (except 16 h for sensor preparation) compared to conventional MS-PCR within 24 h. Furthermore, the LoMA-B system is highly sensitive and can detect as little as 1% methylated DNA in a methylated/unmethylated cell mixture. Therefore, the LoMA-B system is an efficient diagnostic tool for the simple, versatile, and quantitative evaluation of DNA methylation patterns for clinical applications.

Planned caesarean section for term breech delivery. Poor outcomes after breech birth might be the result of underlying conditions causing breech presentation or due to factors associated with the delivery. To assess the effects of planned caesarean section for singleton breech presentation at term on measures of pregnancy outcome. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 March 2015). Randomised trials comparing planned caesarean section for singleton breech presentation at term with planned vaginal birth. Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Three trials (2396 participants) were included in the review. Caesarean delivery occurred in 550/1227 (45%) of those women allocated to a vaginal delivery protocol and 1060/1169 (91%) of those women allocated to planned caesarean section (average risk ratio (RR) random-effects, 1.88, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.60 to 2.20; three studies, 2396 women, evidence graded low quality). Perinatal or neonatal death (excluding fatal anomalies) or severe neonatal morbidity was reduced with a policy of planned caesarean section in settings with a low national perinatal mortality rate (RR 0.07, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.29, one study, 1025 women, evidence graded moderate quality), but not in settings with a high national perinatal mortality rate (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.35 to 1.24, one study, 1053 women, evidence graded low quality). The difference between subgroups was significant (Test for subgroup differences: ChiÂ² = 8.01, df = 1 (P = 0.005), IÂ² = 87.5%). Due to this significant heterogeneity, a random-effects analysis was performed. The average overall effect was not statistically significant (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.02 to 2.44, one study, 2078 infants). Perinatal or neonatal death (excluding fatal anomalies) was reduced with planned caesarean section (RR 0.29, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.86, three studies, 2388 women). The proportional reductions were similar for countries with low and high national perinatal mortality rates.The numbers studied were too small to satisfactorily address reductions in birth trauma and brachial plexus injury with planned caesarean section. Neither of these outcomes reached statistical significance (birth trauma: RR 0.42, 95% CI 0.16 to 1.10, one study, 2062 infants (20 events),evidence graded low quality; brachial plexus injury: RR 0.35, 95% CI 0.08 to 1.47, three studies, 2375 infants (nine events)).Planned caesarean section was associated with modestly increased short-term maternal morbidity (RR 1.29, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.61, three studies, 2396 women,low quality evidence). At three months after delivery, women allocated to the planned caesarean section group reported less urinary incontinence (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.41 to 0.93, one study, 1595 women); no difference in 'any pain' (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29, one study, 1593 women,low quality evidence); more abdominal pain (RR 1.89, 95% CI 1.29 to 2.79, one study, 1593 women); and less perineal pain (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.58, one study, 1593 women).At two years, there were no differences in the combined outcome 'death or neurodevelopmental delay' (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.52 to 2.30, one study, 920 children,evidence graded low quality); more infants who had been allocated to planned caesarean delivery had medical problems at two years (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.89, one study, 843 children). Maternal outcomes at two years were also similar. In countries with low perinatal mortality rates, the protocol of planned caesarean section was associated with lower healthcare costs, expressed in 2002 Canadian dollars (mean difference -$877.00, 95% CI -894.89 to -859.11, one study, 1027 women).All of the trials included in this review had design limitations, and the GRADE level of evidence was mostly low. No studies attempted to blind the intervention, and the process of random allocation was suboptimal in two studies. Two of the three trials had serious design limitations, however these studies contributed to fewer outcomes than the large multi-centre trial with lower risk of bias. Planned caesarean section compared with planned vaginal birth reduced perinatal or neonatal death as well as the composite outcome death or serious neonatal morbidity, at the expense of somewhat increased maternal morbidity. In a subset with 2-year follow up, infant medical problems were increased following planned caesarean section and no difference in long-term neurodevelopmental delay or the outcome "death or neurodevelopmental delay" was found, though the numbers were too small to exclude the possibility of an important difference in either direction.The benefits need to be weighed against factors such as the mother's preference for vaginal birth and risks such as future pregnancy complications in the woman's specific healthcare setting. The option of external cephalic version is dealt with in separate reviews. The data from this review cannot be generalised to settings where caesarean section is not readily available, or to methods of breech delivery that differ materially from the clinical delivery protocols used in the trials reviewed. The review will help to inform individualised decision-making regarding breech delivery. Research on strategies to improve the safety of breech delivery and to further investigate the possible association of caesarean section with infant medical problems is needed.

Alopecia syphilitica-report of a patient with secondary syphilis presenting as moth-eaten alopecia and a review of its common mimickers. Alopecia syphilitica is an uncommon manifestation of secondary syphilis, occurring in only 4 percent of these individuals. It is non-inflammatory and non-cicatricial hair loss that can present in a diffuse pattern, a moth-eaten pattern, or a combination of both. A 38-year-old, otherwise asymptomatic, homosexual man is described whose initial presentation of syphilis was patchy, moth-eaten, alopecia. In addition, differentiating features of alopecia syphilitica and other similar appearing non-cicatricial alopecias are reviewed. Conditions that mimic moth-eaten alopecia include other localized and non-cicatricial alopecias, such as alopecia areata, alopecia neoplastica, tinea capitis, and trichotillomania. The distinguishing clinical and laboratory features of alopecia syphilitica include other mucocutaneous changes associated with secondary syphilis, when present, and a positive serology for syphilis. The treatment of choice is a single intramuscular injection 2.4 million units of benzathine penicillin G for patients without immunocompromise; however, our patient was treated with three weekly doses because of concern about possible HIV positivity. The hair loss usually resolves within 3 months of treatment.

Dlx5 Is a cell autonomous regulator of chondrocyte hypertrophy in mice and functionally substitutes for Dlx6 during endochondral ossification. The axial and appendicular skeleton of vertebrates develops by endochondral ossification, in which skeletogenic tissue is initially cartilaginous and the differentiation of chondrocytes via the hypertrophic pathway precedes the differentiation of osteoblasts and the deposition of a definitive bone matrix. Results from both loss-of-function and misexpression studies have implicated the related homeobox genes Dlx5 and Dlx6 as partially redundant positive regulators of chondrocyte hypertrophy. However, experimental perturbations of Dlx expression have either not been cell type specific or have been done in the context of endogenous Dlx5 expression. Thus, it has not been possible to conclude whether the effects on chondrocyte differentiation are cell autonomous or whether they are mediated by Dlx expression in adjacent tissues, notably the perichondrium. To address this question we first engineered transgenic mice in which Dlx5 expression was specifically restricted to immature and differentiating chondrocytes and not the perichondrium. Col2a1-Dlx5 transgenic embryos and neonates displayed accelerated chondrocyte hypertrophy and mineralization throughout the endochondral skeleton. Furthermore, this transgene specifically rescued defects of chondrocyte differentiation characteristic of the Dlx5/6 null phenotype. Based on these results, we conclude that the role of Dlx5 in the hypertrophic pathway is cell autonomous. We further conclude that Dlx5 and Dlx6 are functionally equivalent in the endochondral skeleton, in that the requirement for Dlx5 and Dlx6 function during chondrocyte hypertrophy can be satisfied with Dlx5 alone.

Anatomy of the reflected ligament of the inguinal region. There is a paucity in the literature regarding the reflected ligament. Therefore, the present study was performed in order to further elucidate this anatomy. Eighteen formalin-fixed adult cadavers (35 sides) underwent dissection of the medial inguinal region. The reflected ligament was observed for and when identified, its dimensions were measured. 83% of sides were found to have a reflected ligament. These were identified in 16 male and 13 female bodies. The size and shape for the reflected ligaments were variable but overall, triangular in nature. In general, the reflected ligament was found to extend from the lacunar and medial inguinal ligaments and extended obliquely toward the midline at an approximate 45 degrees angle to insert near the linea alba. Two ligaments (6.9 %) were identified that interdigitated with the contralateral reflected ligament. The medial and lateral lengths of the ligament had a mean measurement of 2.28 and 2.58 cm. The base of the reflected ligament had a mean of 2.52 cm and the height of this ligament was found to have a mean of 2.56 cm. The mean area of the reflected ligament was calculated as 2.93 cm(2). There was no statistically significant difference between right or left sides or between genders. The reflected ligament was identified in the majority of our specimens and this structure usually contributed to the formation of the posteromedial wall of the external inguinal ring. Therefore, this fact should be included in future descriptions of this ligament.

Thermochemical properties and decomposition pathways of three isomeric semiquinone radicals. Semiquinones are persistent free environmental radicals formed as important initial products from the decomposition of dihydroxylated benzene isomers. This study develops detailed decomposition pathways for the thermal decomposition of the three isomeric semiquinone radicals. Branching ratios based on the calculated high-pressure limit reaction rate constants predict that p-benzoquinone is a major product from the unimolecular decomposition of the p-semiquinone radical, while the formation of o-benzoquinone from the o-semiquinone radical corresponds to a minor channel. This finding is consistent with the absence of o-benzoquinone from the thermal degradation of the 1,2-dihydroxybenzene isomer and the abundance of p-benzoquinone from the thermal decomposition of 1,4-dihydroxybenzene. Ring contraction/CO elimination is shown to be the dominant sink pathway for the o-semiquinone and m-semiquinone radicals. Thermochemical properties, in terms of enthalpies of formation, entropies, and heat capacities for dihydroxylated benzene isomers, semiquinone radicals, and benzoquinones, are evaluated by quantum chemical calculations. Values of the enthalpies of formation calculated by the B3LYP/GTLarge method show good agreement with those obtained at the G3B3 level of theory.

Computer-aided detection of intracranial aneurysms in MR angiography. Intracranial aneurysms represent a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. While the risk factors for aneurysm formation are known, the detection of aneurysms remains challenging. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) has recently emerged as a useful non-invasive method for aneurysm detection. However, even for experienced neuroradiologists, the sensitivity to small (<5 mm) aneurysms in MRA images is poor, on the order of 30~60% in recent, large series. We describe a fully automated computer-aided detection (CAD) scheme for detecting aneurysms on 3D time-of-flight (TOF) MRA images. The scheme locates points of interest (POIs) on individual MRA datasets by combining two complementary techniques. The first technique segments the intracranial arteries automatically and finds POIs from the segmented vessels. The second technique identifies POIs directly from the raw, unsegmented image dataset. This latter technique is useful in cases of incomplete segmentation. Following a series of feature calculations, a small fraction of POIs are retained as candidate aneurysms from the collected POIs according to predetermined rules. The CAD scheme was evaluated on 287 datasets containing 147 aneurysms that were verified with digital subtraction angiography, the accepted standard of reference for aneurysm detection. For two different operating points, the CAD scheme achieved a sensitivity of 80% (71% for aneurysms less than 5 mm) with three mean false positives per case, and 95% (91% for aneurysms less than 5 mm) with nine mean false positives per case. In conclusion, the CAD scheme showed good accuracy and may have application in improving the sensitivity of aneurysm detection on MR images.


Detection of endogenous LRP6 expressed on human cells by monoclonal antibodies specific for the native conformation.

Trypanosoma brucei brucei: thymine 7-hydroxylase-like proteins. Two genes from Trypanosoma brucei brucei are predicted to encode Fe(II)- and alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent enzymes related to fungal thymine 7-hydroxylase. Transcription of the thymine hydroxylase-like genes is up-regulated in the bloodstream form of the parasite over the insect form, whereas Western blot analysis indicates more cross-reactive protein in the latter life stage. The genes were cloned, the proteins purified from Escherichia coli, and both proteins were shown to bind Fe(II) and alpha-ketoglutarate, confirming proper folding. The isolated proteins were incubated with Fe(II)- and alpha-ketoglutarate plus thymine, thymidine, and other putative substrates, but no activity was detected. Furthermore, no thymine 7-hydroxylase activity was detected in extracts of procyclic or bloodstream form cells. Although the functions of these proteins remain unknown, we conclude they are unlikely to be involved in thymine salvage.

Quantitative organellar proteomics analysis of rough endoplasmic reticulum from normal and acute pancreatitis rat pancreas. The rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) is a central organelle for synthesizing and processing digestive enzymes and alteration of ER functions may participate in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis (AP). To comprehensively characterize the normal and diseased RER subproteome, this study quantitatively compared the protein compositions of pancreatic RER between normal and AP animals using isobaric tags (iTRAQ) and 2D LC-MALDI-MS/MS. A total of 469 unique proteins were revealed from four independent experiments using two different AP models. These proteins belong to a large number of functional categories including ribosomal proteins, translocon subunits, chaperones, secretory proteins, and glyco- and lipid-processing enzymes. A total of 37 RER proteins (25 unique in arginine-induced, 6 unique in caerulein-induced and 6 common in both models of AP) showed significant changes during AP including translational regulators and digestive enzymes, whereas only mild changes were found in some ER chaperones. The six proteins common to both AP models included a decrease in pancreatic triacylglycerol lipase precursor, Erp27, and prolyl 4-hydroxylase beta polypeptide as well as a dramatic increase in fibrinogen alpha, beta and gamma chains. These results suggest that the early stages of AP involve changes of multiple RER proteins that may affect the synthesis and processing of digestive enzymes.

Functions of the alpha, beta, and gamma subunits of UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase. UDP-GlcNAc:lysosomal enzyme N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase is an alpha(2)beta(2)gamma(2) hexamer that mediates the first step in the synthesis of the mannose 6-phosphate recognition marker on lysosomal acid hydrolases. Using a multifaceted approach, including analysis of acid hydrolase phosphorylation in mice and fibroblasts lacking the gamma subunit along with kinetic studies of recombinant alpha(2)beta(2)gamma(2) and alpha(2)beta(2) forms of the transferase, we have explored the function of the alpha/beta and gamma subunits. The findings demonstrate that the alpha/beta subunits recognize the protein determinant of acid hydrolases in addition to mediating the catalytic function of the transferase. In mouse brain, the alpha/beta subunits phosphorylate about one-third of the acid hydrolases at close to wild-type levels but require the gamma subunit for optimal phosphorylation of the rest of the acid hydrolases. In addition to enhancing the activity of the alpha/beta subunits toward a subset of the acid hydrolases, the gamma subunit facilitates the addition of the second GlcNAc-P to high mannose oligosaccharides of these substrates. We postulate that the mannose 6-phosphate receptor homology domain of the gamma subunit binds and presents the high mannose glycans of the acceptor to the alpha/beta catalytic site in a favorable manner.

Management of large scalp and skull defects in a severe case of Adams-Oliver syndrome. Adams-Oliver syndrome is a rare congenital disorder that includes congenital scalp and skull defects, variable degrees of terminal transverse limb anomalies, and cardiac malformations. Cutis aplasia occurring in 75% of patients is a potentially life-threatening condition. Large skin defects that cannot be closed primarily present a management dilemma, and may require skin grafting or flaps, or a combination of both operative and conservative modalities. The authors' experience in management of huge scalp and bone defects with the Integra Dermal Regeneration Template and regular dressing changes showed good scalp repair and no serious complications attributed to this approach.

Going green in Cryptococcus neoformans: the recycling of a selectable drug marker. Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that primarily affects immunocompromised individuals. Reverse genetics is commonly used to identify and characterize genes involved in a variety of cellular processes. In C. neoformans there is a limited set of positive selectable markers available to make gene deletions or other genetic manipulations. This has hampered the application of reverse genetics in this organism. We have adapted the Bacteriophage P1 Cre-loxP system for use in C. neoformans and successfully excised and reused the same drug marker, G418, to make two sequential gene deletions, lac1Delta and cap59Delta, in the same strain. This tool will allow investigators to make multiple sequential gene deletions in the same strain, which should facilitate the analysis of multigene families.

[An approach to predicting antioxidative activities of natural products based on near infrared spectroscopy]. The aim of present study is to develop a new approach to predicting antioxidative activities of flavonoid extracts from traditional Chinese medicine based on near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR). The 1,1-diphenyl-2-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH) method was employed to assay the antioxidative activities of twenty-eight extracts. Then, the near infrared diffuse reflectance spectra of those samples were acquired in the range of 4000-10,000 cm(-1). The partial least square (PLS) algorithm was used to generate the calibration model that correlates the spectra and the antioxidative activities of those natural products. The optimal wavenumber ranges and the preprocessing method of original spectrum data were selected during the establishment of calibration model according to the root mean square error of cross-validation (RMSECV). The established model has been successfully applied to predict bioactivities of six samples in the validation set. The value of RMSECV of the proposed model was 9.50% with R2 of 0.9017, and the value of RMSEP was 14.8%. The result indicated that the method can be used for the fast determination of the antioxidative activities of flavonoids as well as other active components of natural products.

Can outcomes of intensive care unit patients undergoing tracheostomy be predicted? To determine whether outcomes (mortality and need for intensive care unit [ICU] readmission) of patients undergoing tracheostomy in the ICU can be predicted by common clinical or historical criteria. We conducted a retrospective review of data from the medical record and Project Impact database in a 24-bed medical-surgical ICU in a 500-bed university hospital. In 2004 through 2006, 60 adult patients underwent tracheostomy as part of their ICU management. We classified each patient as either not readmitted, readmitted, died on floor (after ICU discharge), died on first ICU admission, or combined readmitted/died-on-the-floor. Patients who died on the regular floor were significantly heavier than patients discharged without need for readmission (P = .03). Patients with a history of sepsis and those with a history of neurological disease had a tendency toward worse outcomes, but these did not reach statistical significance. These findings suggest that it is difficult to predict outcomes of patients who undergo tracheostomy in the ICU. Larger and prospective studies may help elucidate this matter.

[Relationship between quality of life and BODE index of stable ex-smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]. This study was carried out to assess relationship between quality of life (QoL) and disease severity expressed by multifactorial prognostic index (BODE) in ex-smokers suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), minimally 8 weeks free of exacerbation. The evaluation was performed in 98 randomly recruited COPD patients enrolled into a cross-sectional, observational CILIARY study at the Department of Pneumology, Charles University, Faculty of Medicine in Hradec KrÃ¡lovÃ©. In them, quality of life evaluation using the SGRQ questionnaire and the BODE index calculation was performed. We statistically compared interrelationship between BODE and COPD stages, SGRQ and COPD stages and interrelation of BODE and SGRQ. We found significant differences in QoL of COPD patients and QoL in group of healthy volunteers (p <0.001). Lower QoL and higher BODE score were associated with a higher stages of COPD (p < 0.001), with the exception non-significant difference in QoL (SGRQ score) and BODE index between stages I and II. Our study found positive correlation between the all SGRQ scores and multidimensional prognostic BODE index (r = 0.431-0.704). The strongest correlation (r = 0.704) was evident in activity domain of SGRQ. Our results proved close correlation ofquality of life (SGRQ) and multidimensional prognostic score (BODE) in stable COPD exsmokers' population. Both these scoring systems are useful tools for the assessment of clinical course and stratification of severity of COPD. However at present both scales are minimally used in the Czech Republic.

Hallmarks in the history of epilepsy: epilepsy in antiquity. The purpose of this article is to highlight the hallmarks of epilepsy as a disease and symptom during antiquity and especially during Ancient Greece and Rome. A thorough study of texts, medical books, and reports along with a review of the available literature in PubMed was undertaken. Observations on epilepsy date back to the medical texts of the Assyrians and Babylonians, almost 2000 years B.C. Considered initially as a divine malady or demonic possession, epilepsy was demythologized by the Father of Medicine, Hippocrates, who was the first to set in dispute its divine origin. Physicians in the early post-Hippocratic era did not make any important contribution regarding the mechanisms of epileptic convulsions, but contributed mainly in the field of nosology and systemization of symptoms.

The long-term effect of a multifactorial fall prevention programme on the incidence of falls requiring medical treatment. To evaluate the long-term effects of a multifactorial fall prevention programme on the incidence of falls requiring medical treatment. A randomized controlled trial. Five hundred and ninety-one community-dwelling elderly people (> or = 65 years) living in the town of Pori, Finland with at least one fall during the previous 12 months were randomized into an intervention group (n=293) and a control group (n=298). Subjects in the intervention group participated in a multifactorial 12-month fall prevention programme. This study evaluated the incidence of falls requiring medical treatment during the 3-year follow-up period. The intervention did not significantly reduce the incidence of falls requiring medical treatment during the 3-year follow-up period [incidence rate ratio (IRR) for the intervention group compared with the control group 0.87, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-1.21]. The number of falls requiring medical treatment was lower in the intervention group (n=32) compared with the control group (n=50) (IRR 0.65, 95%CI 0.40-1.07) during the second year of follow-up, but this was not found during the first year (48 and 48 falls, respectively; IRR 1.04, 95%CI 0.64-1.69) or the third year (44 and 48 falls, respectively; IRR 0.94, 95%CI 0.58-1.53) of follow-up. The multifactorial fall prevention programme did not decrease the incidence of falls requiring medical treatment of fall-prone elderly people during the 3-year follow-up period. However, some positive effect was found during the second year of follow-up (immediately after the 12-month intervention).


Detection of BRCA1 and BRCA2 Ashkenazi Jewish founder mutations in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues using conventional PCR and heteroduplex/amplicon size differences.

The contribution of small cryptic plasmids to the antibiotic resistance of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli E2348/69. Two uncharacterized small cryptic plasmids (SCPs) were isolated from enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strain E2348/69. Genomic DNA sequence analysis of both SCPs indicated that the smaller plasmid, p5217, encoded several mobilization genes, whereas the larger plasmid, p6148, encoded several putative antibiotic resistance determinants. Complementation analysis showed that p6148 encodes functional streptomycin resistance genes but, owing to the presence of several frameshift mutations, a nonfunctional sulfonamide resistance determinant. A plasmid similar to p6148 has previously been shown to confer a slight growth advantage on E. coli. However, we were unable to observe any significant growth advantage in different E. coli strains transformed with p6148. The p6148 DNA sequence is homologous in sequence and arrangement to DNA from other plasmid families, including large conjugative plasmids and SXT integrative and conjugative elements. This study suggests that gene clusters of the sul2-strAB antibiotic resistance genes are widespread and highly transferable, owing to their presence in a wide variety of mobile genetic elements.

[Low back pain in young subjects: a new approach to therapy]. To evaluate the efficiency and safety of arthrofoon versus sublingual nimesulide in patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD) in two parallel groups. Fifty patients (males and females) aged 18-35 years who had acute and chronic low back pain (LBP) (visual analog scale (VAS), > 40 mm) associated with DDD were enrolled in the study. Therapeutic efficiency was evaluated from the intensity of pain (VAS), spinal function (Schober's test and Tomayer's test), the severity of disease (VAS), assessed by a physician and a patient, and the frequency of recurrent pain episodes. The evaluation of the efficacy of arthrofoon showed a statistically significant positive change in pain (VAS), which corresponded to that in the indices of the pain syndrome during nimesulide administration. There was a statistically significant reduction in the frequency of recurrences in patients with chronic intermittent LBP treated with arthrofoon (p < 0.01). Arthrofoon used alone and in combination with paracetamol demonstrated a good safety profile. In DDD-associated LBP, the use of arthrofoon is effective and safe in young patients with both the acute (in combination with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as a short course) and chronic (requiring long-term anti-inflammatory therapy) types of the disease.

Single embryo and oocyte lipid fingerprinting by mass spectrometry. Methods used for lipid analysis in embryos and oocytes usually involve selective lipid extraction from a pool of many samples followed by chemical manipulation, separation and characterization of individual components by chromatographic techniques. Herein we report direct analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) of single and intact embryos or oocytes from various species. Biological samples were simply moisturized with the matrix solution and characteristic lipid (represented by phosphatidylcholines, sphingomyelins and triacylglycerols) profiles were obtained via MALDI-MS. As representative examples, human, bovine, sheep and fish oocytes, as well as bovine and insect embryos were analyzed. MALDI-MS is shown to be capable of providing characteristic lipid profiles of gametes and embryos and also to respond to modifications due to developmental stages and in vitro culture conditions of bovine embryos. Investigation in developmental biology of the biological roles of structural and reserve lipids in embryos and oocytes should therefore benefit from these rapid MALDI-MS profiles from single and intact species.

"Improved" But Not Necessarily Safe: An Assessment of Fecal Contamination of Household Drinking Water in Rural Peru. The indicator used to measure progress toward the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for water is access to an improved water supply. However, improved supplies are frequently fecally contaminated in developing countries. We examined factors associated with Escherichia coli contamination of improved water supplies in rural Pisco province, Peru. A random sample of 207 households with at least one child less than 5 years old was surveyed, and water samples from the source and storage container were tested for E. coli contamination. Although over 90% of households used an improved water source, 47% of source and 43% of stored water samples were contaminated with E. coli. Pouring or using a spigot to obtain water from the storage container instead of dipping a hand or object was associated with decreased risk of contamination of stored water (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] = 0.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.42, 0.80). Container cleanliness (aPR = 0.67, 95% CI = 0.45, 1.00) and correct handwashing technique (aPR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.42, 0.90) were also associated with decreased contamination risk. These findings highlighted the limitations of improved water supplies as an indicator of safe water access. To ensure water safety in the home, household water treatment and improved hygiene, water handling, and storage practices should be promoted. 

Optimization of square-wave electroporation for transfection of porcine fetal fibroblasts. Development of a transgenic porcine biomedical research model requires effective delivery of DNA into the donor cell followed by selection of genetically modified somatic cell lines to be used for nuclear transfer. The objective of the current study was 2-fold: (1) to compare the effectiveness of a single 1 ms pulse of different voltages (V; 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350) and multiple 1 ms pulses (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) at 300 V for delivery and expression of super-coiled GFP vector in surviving cells of three fetal fibroblast cell lines, and (2) to determine the ability of these electroporation parameters to produce stably transfected fibroblast colonies following G418 selection. Cell line (P < 0.001) and voltage (P < 0.001) affected DNA delivery into the cell as assessed by GFP expression while survival at 24 h was affected by voltage (P < 0.001) and not by cell line (P = 0.797). Using a single pulse while increasing voltage resulted in the percentage of GFP expressing cells increasing from 3.2 +/- 0.8% to 43.0 +/- 3.4% while survival decreased from 90.5 +/- 8.0% to 44.8 +/- 2.0%. The number of pulses at 300 V significantly affected survival (P < 0.001) and GFP expression (P < 0.001). Survival steadily decreased following 1-5 pulses from 63.2 +/- 6.3% to 3.0 +/- 0.3% with GFP expression of surviving cells increasing from 35.6 +/- 2.67% to 71.4 +/- 6.1%. Electroporation of a selectable marker at a 1:1 copy number ratio to a co-electroporated transgene resulted in 83% of G418 resistant colonies also being PCR positive for the secondary transgene. These electroporation conditions, specifically, three 1 ms pulses of 300 V to 200 muL of 1 x 10(6) cells/mL in the presence of 12.5 mug DNA/mL effectively introduced DNA into somatic cells. The utilization of these conditions produced numerous transgenic fibroblast colonies following G418 selection that when used for somatic cell nuclear transfer resulted in the production of live offspring.


Decoding an olfactory mechanism of kin recognition and inbreeding avoidance in a primate.

How amide hydrogens exchange in native proteins. Amide hydrogen exchange (HX) is widely used in protein biophysics even though our ignorance about the HX mechanism makes data interpretation imprecise. Notably, the open exchange-competent conformational state has not been identified. Based on analysis of an ultralong molecular dynamics trajectory of the protein BPTI, we propose that the open (O) states for amides that exchange by subglobal fluctuations are locally distorted conformations with two water molecules directly coordinated to the N-H group. The HX protection factors computed from the relative O-state populations agree well with experiment. The O states of different amides show little or no temporal correlation, even if adjacent residues unfold cooperatively. The mean residence time of the O state is â¼100 ps for all examined amides, so the large variation in measured HX rate must be attributed to the opening frequency. A few amides gain solvent access via tunnels or pores penetrated by water chains including native internal water molecules, but most amides access solvent by more local structural distortions. In either case, we argue that an overcoordinated N-H group is necessary for efficient proton transfer by Grotthuss-type structural diffusion.

Inertial microfluidics for sheath-less high-throughput flow cytometry. Flow cytometer is a powerful single cell analysis tool that allows multi-parametric study of suspended cells. Most commercial flow cytometers available today are bulky, expensive instruments requiring high maintenance costs and specially trained personnel for operation. Hence, there is a need to develop a low cost, portable alternative that will aid in making this powerful research tool more accessible. In this paper we describe a sheath-less, on-chip flow cytometry system based on the principle of Dean coupled inertial microfluidics. The design takes advantage of the Dean drag and inertial lift forces acting on particles flowing through a spiral microchannel to focus them in 3-D at a single position across the microchannel cross-section. Unlike the previously reported micro-flow cytometers, the developed system relies entirely on the microchannel geometry for particle focusing, eliminating the need for complex microchannel designs and additional microfluidic plumbing associated with sheath-based techniques. In this work, a 10-loop spiral microchannel 100 microm wide and 50 microm high was used to focus 6 microm particles in 3-D. The focused particle stream was detected with a laser induced fluorescence (LIF) setup. The microfluidic system was shown to have a high throughput of 2,100 particles/sec. Finally, the viability of the developed technique for cell counting was demonstrated using SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The passive focusing principle and the planar nature of the described design will permit easy integration with existing lab-on-a-chip (LOC) systems.

[Effect of BMSCs transplantation on cardiac function of diabetes mellitus rats]. To observe the effect of BMSCs on the cardiac function in diabetes mellitus (DM) rats through injecting BMSCs into the ventricular wall of the diabetic rats and investigate its mechanism. BMSCs isolated from male SD rats (3-4 months old) were cultured in vitro, and the cells at passage 5 underwent DAPI labeling. Thirty clean grade SD inbred strain male rats weighing about 250 g were randomized into the normal control group (group A), the DM group (group B), and the cell transplantation group (group C). The rats in groups B and C received high fat forage for 4 weeks and the intraperitoneal injection of 30 mg/kg streptozotocin to made the experimental model of type II DM. PBS and DAPI-labeled passage 5 BMSCs (1 x 10(5)/microL, 160 microL) were injected into the ventricular wall of the rats in groups B and C, respectively. After feeding those rats with high fat forage for another 8 weeks, the apoptosis of myocardial cells was detected by TUNEL, the cardiac function was evaluated with multi-channel physiology recorder, the myocardium APPL1 protein expression was detected by Western blot and immunohistochemistry test, and the NO content was detected by nitrate reductase method. Group C underwent all those tests 16 weeks after taking basic forage. In group A, the apoptosis rate was 6.14% +/- 0.02%, the AAPL1 level was 2.79 +/- 0.32, left ventricular -dP/dt (LV-dP/dt) was (613.27 +/- 125.36) mm Hg/s (1 mm Hg = 0.133 kPa), the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was (10.06 +/- 3.24) mm Hg, and the NO content was (91.54 +/- 6.15) nmol/mL. In group B, the apoptosis rate was 45.71% +/- 0.04%, the AAPL1 level 1.08 +/- 0.24 decreased significantly when compared with group A, the LV-dP/dt was (437.58 +/- 117.58) mm Hg/s, the LVEDP was (17.89 +/- 2.35) mm Hg, and the NO content was (38.91+/-8.67) nmol/mL. In group C, the apoptosis rate was 27.43% +/- 0.03%, the APPL1 expression level was 2.03 +/- 0.22, the LV -dP/dt was (559.38 +/- 97.37) mm Hg/s, the LVEDP was (12.55 +/- 2.87) mm Hg, and the NO content was (138.79 +/- 7.23) nmol/mL. For the above mentioned parameters, there was significant difference between group A and group B (P < 0.05), and between group B and group C (P < 0.05). BMSCs transplantation can improve the cardiac function of diabetic rats. Its possible mechanism may be related to the activation of APPL1 signaling pathway and the increase of NO content.

Rationale and design of the Patient Related OuTcomes with Endeavor versus Cypher stenting Trial (PROTECT): randomized controlled trial comparing the incidence of stent thrombosis and clinical events after sirolimus or zotarolimus drug-eluting stent implantation. Drug-eluting stents (DES) reduce restenosis rates compared to bare-metal stents. Most trials using DES enrolled selected patient and lesion subtypes, and primary endpoint focused on angiographic metrics or relatively short-term outcomes. When DES are used in broader types of lesions and patients, important differences may emerge in long-term outcomes between stent types, particularly the incidence of late stent thrombosis. PROTECT is a randomized, open-label trial comparing the long-term safety of the zotarolimus-eluting stent and the sirolimus-eluting stent. The trial has enrolled 8,800 patients representative of those seen in routine clinical practice, undergoing elective, unplanned, or emergency procedures in native coronary arteries in 196 centers in 36 countries. Indications for the procedure and selection of target vessel and lesion characteristics were at the operator's discretion. Procedures could be staged, but no more than 4 target lesions could be treated per patient. Duration of dual antiplatelet therapy was prespecified to achieve similar lengths of treatment in both study arms. The shortest predefined duration was 3 months, as per the manufacturer's instructions. The primary outcome measure is the composite rate of definite and probable stent thrombosis at 3 years, centrally adjudicated using Academic Research Consortium definitions. The main secondary end points are 3-year all-cause mortality, cardiac death, large nonfatal myocardial infarction, and all myocardial infarctions. This large, international, randomized, controlled trial will provide important information on comparative rates of stent thrombosis between 2 different DES systems and safety as assessed by patient-relevant long-term clinical outcomes.

Immunostimulatory RNA blocks suppression by regulatory T cells. The role of immune suppression by regulatory T (Treg) cells in the maintenance of immune homeostasis is well established. However, little is known about how Treg cell function is inhibited on viral infection to allow the development of a protective immune response. As viral RNA is a crucial mediator for activation of antiviral immunity, we examined the effects of immunostimulatory RNA and infection with RNA viruses on Treg cell function. We show that synthetic RNA oligonucleotides potently inhibit Treg cell-induced suppression in a sequence-dependent manner. This effect is entirely dependent on TLR7 activation of APCs and subsequent IL-6 production. In addition, stimulation with the RNA viruses encephalomyocarditis virus and Sendai virus that specifically activate the RNA-sensing helicases melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) also blocks Treg cell function. Interestingly, this effect is seen even in the absence of APCs. Consistent with this, both Treg and T effector cells express RIG-I and MDA-5. Using MDA-5-deficient mice, we demonstrate that the loss of Treg cell function on infection with encephalomyocarditis virus is strictly dependent on MDA-5 expression by Treg cells. Thus, we show in this study for the first time that activation of a RIG-I-like helicase on Treg cells blocks their suppressive function.

Retinal ganglion cell population in adult albino and pigmented mice: a computerized analysis of the entire population and its spatial distribution. In adult Swiss albino and C57 pigmented mice, RGCs were identified with a retrogradely transported neuronal tracer applied to both optic nerves (ON) or superior colliculi (SCi). After histological processing, the retinas were prepared as whole-mounts, examined and photographed under a fluorescence microscope equipped with a motorized stage controlled by a commercial computer image analysis system: Image-Pro Plus((R)) (IPP). Retinas were imaged as a stack of 24-bit color images (140 frames per retina) using IPP with the Scope-Pro plug-in 5.0 and the images montaged to create a high-resolution composite of the retinal whole-mount when required. Single images were also processed by specific macros written in IPP that apply a sequence of filters and transformations in order to separate individual cells for automatic counting. Cell counts were later transferred to a spreadsheet for statistical analysis and used to generate a RGC density map for each retina. The mean total numbers of RGCs labeled from the ON, in Swiss (49,493+/-3936; n=18) or C57 mice (42,658+/-1540; n=10) were slightly higher than the mean numbers of RGCs labeled from the SCi, in Swiss (48,733+/-3954; n=43) or C57 mice (41,192+/-2821; n=42), respectively. RGCs were distributed throughout the retina and density maps revealed a horizontal region in the superior retina near the optic disk with highest RGC densities. In conclusion, the population of mice RGCs may be counted automatically with a level of confidence comparable to manual counts. The distribution of RGCs adopts a form of regional specialization that resembles a horizontal visual streak.

Relationship between costs of lifestyle interventions and weight loss in overweight adults. Lifestyle interventions in a healthcare setting are effective for weight loss, but it is unclear whether more expensive interventions result in more weight loss. Our objective was to explore the relationship between intervention costs and effectiveness in a systematic review of randomized trials. Intervention studies were selected from 14 reviews and from a systematic MEDLINE-search. Studies had to contain a dietary and a physical activity component and report data on measured weight loss in healthy Caucasian overweight adults. Intervention costs were calculated in a standardized way. The association between costs and percentage weight loss after 1 year was assessed using regression analysis. Nineteen original studies describing 31 interventions were selected. The relationship between weight loss and intervention costs was best described by an asymptotic regression model, which explained 47% of the variance in weight loss. A clinically relevant weight loss of 5% was already observed in interventions of approximately euro110. Results were similar in an intention-to-treat analysis. In conclusion, lifestyle interventions in health care for overweight adults are relatively cheap and higher intervention costs are associated with more weight loss, although the effect of costs on weight loss levels off with growing costs.

Signaling mechanism(s) of reactive oxygen species in Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition reminiscent of cancer stem cells in tumor progression. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are known to serve as a second messenger in the intracellular signal transduction pathway for a variety of cellular processes, including inflammation, cell cycle progression, apoptosis, aging and cancer. Recently, ROS have been found to be associated with tumor metastasis involving the processes of tumor cell migration, invasion and angiogenesis. Emerging evidence also suggests that Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a process that is reminiscent of cancer stem cells, is an important step toward tumor invasion and metastasis, and intimately involved in de novo and acquired drug resistance. In light of recent advances, we are summarizing the role of ROS in EMT by cataloging how its deregulation is involved in EMT and tumor aggressiveness. Further attempts have been made to summarize the role of several chemopreventive agents that could be useful for targeted inactivation of ROS, suggesting that many natural agents could be useful for the reversal of EMT, which would become a novel approach for the prevention of tumor progression and/or treatment of human malignancies especially by killing EMT-type cells that shares similar characteristics with cancer stem cells.


Serum antibody responses to Wolbachia surface protein in patients with human lymphatic filariasis.

Long-term outcome of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis after pediatric renal transplantation. Recurrence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) after renal transplantation can limit graft survival. Despite new immunosuppressive agents, the incidence of recurrence remains relatively high. To identify risk factors for recurrence and efficacy of treatment, we reviewed the outcome of 23 grafts in 16 children with FSGS who had undergone transplantation between 1985 and 2007 at La Paz Children's Hospital. Recurrence was 56.3% after the first transplantation. We did not find significant differences in age at diagnosis, age at transplantation, age at end-stage renal disease (ESRD), progression to ESRD, bilateral nephrectomy of native kidneys prior to transplantation, use of induction therapy or of different immunosuppressive regimens between patients with and without recurrence. Plasmapheresis (PP) was carried out in seven of nine patients who had suffered recurrence, achieving remission in six of them. One patient received high doses of cyclosporin (CsA) and plasmapheresis, attaining remission. Graft survival was lower (P = 0.043) in patients with FSGS than in those with other ESRD etiologies (first year 75% vs 91%; fifth year 44% vs 78%). Recurrence of FSGS limited graft survival (first year 66% vs 85%; third year 20% vs 68%) (P = 0.07). In our experience, PP can be effective in treating FSGS recurrence, although its effect on long-term graft survival seems more limited.

Good treatment outcomes among foreigners receiving antiretroviral therapy in Johannesburg, South Africa. Foreigners, including displaced persons, often have limited health-care access, especially to HIV services. Outcomes of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in South Africans and foreigners were compared at a Johannesburg non-governmental clinic. Records were reviewed of 1297 adults enrolled between April 2004 and March 2007 (568 self-identified foreigners, 431 South Africans citizens and 298 with unknown origin). Compared with citizens, foreigners had fewer hospital admissions (39%, 90/303 versus 51%, 126/244; P < 0.001), less missed appointments for ART initiation (20%, 39/200 versus 25%, 51/206; P < 0.001), faster median time to ART initiation (14 versus 21 days, P = 0.008), better retention in care (88%, 325/369 versus 69%, 155/226; P < 0.001) and lower mortality (2.5%, 14/568 versus 10%, 44/431; P < 0.001) after 426 person-years. In logistic regression, after controlling for baseline CD4 count and tuberculosis status, foreigners were 55% less likely to fail ART than citizens (95% CI = 0.23-0.87). These findings support United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees recommendations that ART should not be withheld from displaced persons.

Anti-proliferative efficacy of icariin on HepG2 hepatoma and its possible mechanism of action. The aim of the present work was to explore the anti-hepatoma effects of icariin both in vitro and in vivo and to elucidate its potential mechanism of action. The MTT assay was applied to test the anti-proliferative effects of icariin in vitro. HepG2 bearing NMRI nu/nu mice were used to test the anticancer effects of icariin in vivo. Immunohistochemical assay and flow cytometry assay (FACS) were applied to detect the possible mechanisms of action of icariin. MTT assay illustrated that icariin inhibited the proliferation of HepG2 cells in a concentration dependent manner; meanwhile, icariin inhibited the tumor growth in HepG2 bearing NMRI nu/nu mice. The tumor weight was inhibited by 55.6% and tumor volume was inhibited by 47.2%. Icariin did not influence the spleen and body weights or blood parameters. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that the expressions of both CD31 and Ki67 in the icariin treated group were significantly lower than those in the control group (p < 0.01). FACS assay showed that icariin dramatically decreased the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ cells in bone marrow and CD19+ cells in blood on day 8. On day 17, the percentage of CD8+ cells in blood was lower than those in the control group. CD4/CD8 ratio in icariin group was significantly elevated in bone marrow on day 17. Icariin showed anticancer efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. The possible mechanism of action could be related to its anti-angiogenesis and anti-proliferative effects in tumors.

Relaxant effects of matrine on aortic smooth muscles of guinea pigs. To determine whether matrine, a kind of traditional Chinese medicinal alkaloid, can relax the aortic smooth muscles isolated from guinea pigs and to investigate the mechanism of its relaxant effects. Phenylephrine or potassium chloride concentration-dependent relaxation response of aortic smooth muscles to matrine was studied in the precontracted guinea pigs. Matrine (1 x 10(-4) mol/L -3.3 x 10(3) mol/L) relaxed the endothelium-denuded aortic rings pre-contracted sub-maximally with phenylephrine, in a concentration-dependent manner, and its pre-incubation (3.3 x 10(-3) mol/L) produced a significant rightward shift in the phenylephrine dose-response curve, but had no effects on the potassium chloride-induced contraction. The anti-contractile effect of matrine was not reduced by the highly selective ATP-dependent K+ channel blocker glibenclamide (10(-5) mol/L), either by the non-selective K+ channel blocker tetraethylammonium (10(-3) mol/L), or by the beta-antagonist propranolol (10(-5) mol/L). In either "normal" or "Ca(2+)-free" bathing medium, the phenylephrine-induced contraction was attenuated by matrine (3.3 x 10(-3) mol/L), indicating that the vasorelaxation was due to inhibition of intracellular and extracellular Ca2+ mobilization. Matrine inhibits phenylephrine-induced contractions by inhibiting activation of alpha-adrenoceptor and interfering with the release of intracellular Ca2+ and the influx of extracellular Ca2+.

Job sharing for women pharmacists in academia. The pharmacist shortage, increasing numbers of female pharmacy graduates, more pharmacy schools requiring faculty members, and a lower percentage of female faculty in academia are reasons to develop unique arrangements for female academic pharmacists who wish to work part-time. Job sharing is an example of a flexible alternative work arrangement that can be successful for academic pharmacists who wish to continue in a part-time capacity. Such partnerships have worked for other professionals but have not been widely adopted in pharmacy academia. Job sharing can benefit the employer through retention of experienced employees who collectively offer a wider range of skills than a single employee. Benefits to the employee include balanced work and family lives with the ability to maintain their knowledge and skills by remaining in the workforce. We discuss the additional benefits of job-sharing as well as our experience in a non-tenure track job-sharing position at the University of Tennessee College of Pharmacy.

Using a heating cable within the abdomen to make hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy easier: feasibility and safety study in a pig model. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is a complex, expensive and time-consuming procedure. Despite its good results in the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis, these factors have precluded the wider use of this procedure around the world. We hypothesized that HIPEC could be performed by heating the liquid within the abdomen and thus avoiding the need for an external heating circuit and a pump. The aim of this study was to assess the feasibility and safety of an internal heating device for hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy in an experimental model. Four large-white pigs underwent one-hour open intraperitoneal hyperthermia with closed abdomen using this new device. Constant stirring of the liquid around the viscera was performed in the first three animals, but not in the fourth one. At the end of the procedure, all of the viscera were carefully examined to look for thermal injury. Any lesion or doubtful area was removed and sent to pathologic examination. No adverse events occurred during surgery in any of the animals. A temperature of 42 degrees C was reached in an average time of 14 min and maintained homogeneously between 42 degrees C and 43 degrees C for one hour. No visceral injury was detected in the first three animals. Three foci of thermal injury to the mucosa were detected in the absence of stirring (fourth animal). Heating the solution within the abdomen during hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy is feasible, safe and achieves perfect thermal homogeneity. This device provides a time-saving inexpensive way to perform intraperitoneal hyperthermic chemotherapy.

Interleukin-6 trans-signalling differentially regulates proliferation, migration, adhesion and maspin expression in human prostate cancer cells. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is suggested to have a pathogenic role in the progression of prostate cancer (PC), therefore representing an attractive target for new therapies. However, due to the pleiotropy of this cytokine, targeting IL-6 results in different and unpredictable responses. In order to better understand the mechanisms underlying the different responses to the cytokine, we focused our attention on IL-6 receptors (IL-6Rs) that represent the first element in the cascade of cytokine-activated signalling pathways. IL-6 signal transduction may indeed occur through the membrane IL-6R (classical signalling) and/or through the less studied soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R; IL-6 trans-signalling (IL-6TS)). We provide the first evidence how responses to IL-6 may depend on the different content of IL-6Rs in PC. In particular, the studies of (3)H-thymidine incorporation and exploitation of different approaches (i.e. activation or inhibition of IL-6TS in sIL-6R-negative and -positive cell lines and transfection of IL-6R siRNA) allowed us to demonstrate that IL-6TS specifically accounts for an anti-proliferative effect of the cytokine in three PC cell lines that are known to respond differently to IL-6. Additionally, by applying migration-, scratch- and adhesion assays, we show that IL-6TS increases motility and migration and decreases adhesion of prostate cells facilitating thereby processes that determine metastasis initiation and spread. Finally, by western analyses, we uncovered an IL-6- and sIL-6R-dependent downregulation of the tumour suppressor maspin. Collectively, these data suggest that selective targeting of IL-6TS might allow to refine the currently available experimental anti-IL-6 therapies against PC.

Regulatory role of the extreme C-terminal end of the S6 inner helix in C-terminal-truncated Kv1.2 channel activation. The transmembrane part of the S6 inner helix of the Kv1.2 potassium channel is a pivotal part in sustaining channel activity. However, the role of its extreme C-terminal end, which is located on the cytoplasmic side of the channel, is largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of the extreme C-terminal end of the S6 inner helix (the HRET region) by constructing a series of C-terminal-truncated mutations related to this region in the C-terminal-truncated Kv1.2 channel. Mutations on Thr421 or Glu420 significantly altered the activation of the truncated channel. Mutations on Arg419 demonstrated that neutral or basic, but not acidic amino acid, is essential at the position for the truncated channel activation, and no functional channel was observed when the channel was truncated from His418. Hence, our results indicate that the extreme C-terminal end of the S6 inner helix plays an important regulatory role in the activation of the C-terminal-truncated Kv1.2 channel.

Synonymous Genetic Variation in Natural Isolates of Escherichia coli Does Not Predict Where Synonymous Substitutions Occur in a Long-Term Experiment. Synonymous genetic differences vary by more than 20-fold among genes in natural isolates of Escherichia coli. One hypothesis to explain this heterogeneity is that genes with high levels of synonymous variation mutate at higher rates than genes with low synonymous variation. If so, then one would expect to observe similar mutational patterns in evolution experiments. In fact, however, the pattern of synonymous substitutions in a long-term evolution experiment with E. coli does not support this hypothesis. In particular, the extent of synonymous variation across genes in that experiment does not reflect the variation observed in natural isolates of E. coli. Instead, gene length alone predicts with high accuracy the prevalence of synonymous changes in the experimental populations. We hypothesize that patterns of synonymous variation in natural E. coli populations are instead caused by differences across genomic regions in their effective population size that, in turn, reflect different histories of recombination, horizontal gene transfer, selection, and population structure. 

[A meta-analysis of interferon-beta in the secondary progressive multiple sclerosis]. To systematically review the clinical efficacy of interferon-beta in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. A systematically review of Cochrane were conducted. The authors searched in electronic literatures of Medline (1980. 1-2008. 1), Ovid (1980. 1-2008. 1), Pubmed (1980. 1-2008. 1), CBMdisc (1980. 1-2008. 1), Cochrane Library (2008. 1) and hand-searched the relevant literatures and symposium reports. The randomized controlled trials of interferon-beta were assessed in secondary progressive MS patients. After evaluating the quality of literatures and extracting the valid data, the authors assessed the randomized controlled trials of interferon-beta in secondary progressive MS patients. RevMan 4.2.3 software was used. Based upon the testing result of heterogeneity, fixed or random effect model was employed to calculate the odds ratio (OR) and 95% CI. Six RCTs of 3115 patients were included. The results indicated that interferon-beta could reduce 1 and 2-year progression rate (OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.61-0.88 and OR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.72-0.98) and lower the relapses rate (OR = 0.67, 95% = 0.55-0.82). Subgroup analysis suggested that relapsing women and patients during the two years before the study benefit much more from interferon-beta (OR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.53-0.92 vs. OR = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.55-0.97). The treatment of interferon-beta in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis could reduce 1 and 2-year progression rate and lower the relapses rate.

[Male stress urinary incontinence by InVance bone anchored sub-urethral sling: Predictive factors of treatment failure: Multicentric study by the CTMH-AFU]. To define predictive factors of treatment failure in a multicentric study for the treatment of stress male urinary incontinence by InVance (American Medical System, USA) bone anchored sub-urethral sling. Cases treated by InVance between January 2005 and December 2007 in four French academic centers were collected. Eighty-four patients were evaluated. Mean age was 68 years old. With a mean follow-up of 20 months, 38 patients (45%) were dry, 22 (26%) were improved, and 24 (29%) suffered treatment failure. In univariate analysis, three parameters were significantly associated with treatment failure, including severe urinary incontinence (P=0.005), urodynamic instability (P=0.043), and incontinence due to a bitherapy including external radiotherapy (P=0.031). If zero or one versus two or three risk factors were present, treatment failure rate was 25 and 67%, respectively (P=0.013). In multivariate analysis, bitherapy including radiotherapy was the sole independent treatment failure risk factor (P=0.017). Two patient groups were defined, allowing to determine preoperatively good candidates and bad candidates for stress urinary incontinence treatment by InVance sling.

Monitoring phase transformations in intact tablets of trehalose by FT-Raman spectroscopy. The purpose of this study is to monitor phase transformations in intact trehalose tablets using FT-Raman spectroscopy. Tablets of trehalose dihydrate, amorphous trehalose (obtained by freeze-drying aqueous trehalose solutions), and anhydrous trehalose (beta-trehalose) were prepared. The tablets were exposed to different conditions [11% and 0% RH (60 degrees C); 75% RH (25 degrees C)] and monitored periodically over 96 h using Raman spectroscopy. Within 96 h of storage, the following phase transformations were observed: (1) trehalose dihydrate-->beta-trehalose (11% RH, 60 degrees C), (2) trehalose dihydrate-->alpha-trehalose (0% RH, 60 degrees C), (3) beta-trehalose-->trehalose dihydrate (75% RH, 25 degrees C), and (4) amorphous trehalose-->trehalose dihydrate (75% RH, 25 degrees C). FT-Raman spectroscopy was a useful technique to identify the solid form and monitor multiple-phase transformations in intact trehalose tablets stored at different conditions.

Molecular priming of Lyn by GPVI enables an immune receptor to adopt a hemostatic role. The immune receptor signaling pathway is used by nonimmune cells, but the molecular adaptations that underlie its functional diversification are not known. Circulating platelets use the immune receptor homologue glycoprotein VI (GPVI) to respond to collagen exposed at sites of vessel injury. In contrast to immune cell responses, platelet activation must take place within seconds to successfully form thrombi in flowing blood. Here, we show that the GPVI receptor utilizes a unique intracellular proline-rich domain (PRD) to accelerate platelet activation, a requirement for efficient platelet adhesion to collagen under flow. The GPVI PRD specifically binds the Src-family kinase Lyn and directly activates it, presumably through SH3 displacement. In resting platelets, Lyn is constitutively bound to GPVI in an activated state and platelets lacking Lyn exhibit defective collagen adhesion like that of platelets with GPVI receptors lacking the PRD. These findings define a molecular priming mechanism that enables an immune-type receptor to adopt a hemostatic function. These studies also demonstrate that active kinases can constitutively associate with immune-type receptors without initiating signal transduction before receptor ligation, consistent with a recent molecular model of immune receptor signaling in which receptor ligation is required to bring active kinases to their receptor substrates.

[Protective effects of melatonin on cultural human retinal pigment epithelial cells against oxidative damage in vitro]. To investigate the protective effects of melatonin on the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) against oxidative damage induced by hydrogen dioxide (H2O2) and its mechanism. The RPE cells were seeded and divided into normal control group, oxidative damage group and the treatment group (treated with melatonin at the concentration of 1 x 10(-7) mol/L, 1 x 10(-6) mol/L, 1 x 10(-5) mol/L and 1 x 10(-4) mol/L). The model of oxidative damage on the RPE cells was established by culturing the RPE cells with H2O2 at the concentration of 600 micromol/L for 1 hour in vitro. The cell viability of RPE cells was detected by the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method. The degree of oxidative damage was evaluated by detecting the superoxide dismutase (SOD) and maleic dialdehyde (MDA). Apoptosis was detected qualitatively using the DNA Ladders electrophoretic method, and quantitatively using the Annexin V-FITC/PI double staining flow cytometry. Compared with normal control group, the oxidative damage group had low cell viability, low SOD and high MDA contents, and high apoptosis rate (t = 2.25, 39.50, 68.42; P < 0.05). Compared with oxidative damage group, the treatment group had high cell viability, high SOD and low MDA contents, and low apoptosis rate (P < 0.05). Melatonin has a protective effect on the RPE against oxidative damage induced by H2O2. The mechanism may involve in reinforcing the cell viability, strengthening the activity of antioxidase, and reducing the apoptosis.

Furosemide infusion prevents the requirement of renal replacement therapy after cardiac surgery. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a devastating complication following cardiac surgery and the ideal management is controversial. This prospective, randomized, open-label and double-blinded study analyzed the renoprotective effects of furosemide infusion and intermittent bolus therapy administered with dopamine infusion in cardiac surgical patients. Between August 1, 2007 and July 31, 2008, 100 adult patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) surgery with normal renal function (creatinine <1.4 mg/dl) were enrolled in the study. The patients were randomized for the comparison of intermittent (Group 1, n=50, 1mg-3mg/kg) and continuous infusion of furosemide (Group 2, n=50, 10mg/ml). Continuous variables were expressed as mean+/- SD and compared by unpaired Student's t test or ANOVA for repeated measures. Statistical significance was assumed if p value was <0.05. Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was used in 5% of patients (all in group 1, p=0.028). The 30-day mortality was 5%. Only 2 patients became hemodialysis dependent in group 1. Group 2 patients showed a continuous and higher urine output postoperatively than group 1 (p<0.001). Both groups had significant increase in peak postoperative serum creatinine values (p<0.001), however peak postoperative creatinine-clearance was significantly lower in group 1 (p<0.001). Acute kidney injury necessitating RRT makes a small percentage of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and if RRT is not required the survival is excellent. Continuous infusion of furosemide seems to be effective in promoting diuresis and decreasing the need for RRT. However further multicenter studies with different doses of furosemide are required to confirm these results.

Arabidopsis deadenylases AtCAF1a and AtCAF1b play overlapping and distinct roles in mediating environmental stress responses. To maintain homeostasis in an ever-changing environment organisms have evolved mechanisms to reprogram gene expression. One central mechanism regulating gene expression is messenger RNA (mRNA) degradation, which is initiated by poly(A) tail shortening (deadenylation). The carbon catabolite repressor 4-CCR4 associated factor1 (CCR4-CAF1) complex is the major enzyme complex that catalyzes mRNA deadenylation and is conserved among eukaryotes. However, the components and functions of this global regulatory complex have not been well characterized in plants. Here we investigate the CAF1 family in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). We identify 11 AtCAF1 homologs and show that a subset of these genes are responsive to mechanical wounding, among them are AtCAF1a and AtCAF1b whose expression levels are rapidly and transiently induced by wounding. The differential expression profiles of the various AtCAF1s suggest that not all AtCAF1 genes are involved in stress-responsive regulation of transcript levels. Comparison of misexpressed genes identified via transcript profiling of Atcaf1a and Atcaf1b mutants at different time points before and after wounding suggests that AtCAF1a and AtCAF1b target shared and unique transcripts for deadenylation with temporal specificity. Consistent with the AtPI4Kgamma3 transcript exhibiting the largest increase in abundance in Atcaf1b, AtCAF1b targets AtPI4Kgamma3 mRNA for deadenylation. Stress-tolerance assays demonstrate that AtCAF1a and AtCAF1b are involved in mediating abiotic stress responses. However, AtCAF1a and AtCAF1b are not functionally redundant in all cases, nor are they essential for all environmental stresses. These findings demonstrate that these closely related proteins exhibit overlapping and distinct roles with respect to mRNA deadenylation and mediation of stress responses.

Insights into G-quadruplex specific recognition by the DEAH-box helicase RHAU: Solution structure of a peptide-quadruplex complex. Four-stranded nucleic acid structures called G-quadruplexes have been associated with important cellular processes, which should require G-quadruplex-protein interaction. However, the structural basis for specific G-quadruplex recognition by proteins has not been understood. The DEAH (Asp-Glu-Ala-His) box RNA helicase associated with AU-rich element (RHAU) (also named DHX36 or G4R1) specifically binds to and resolves parallel-stranded G-quadruplexes. Here we identified an 18-amino acid G-quadruplex-binding domain of RHAU and determined the structure of this peptide bound to a parallel DNA G-quadruplex. Our structure explains how RHAU specifically recognizes parallel G-quadruplexes. The peptide covers a terminal guanine base tetrad (G-tetrad), and clamps the G-quadruplex using three-anchor-point electrostatic interactions between three positively charged amino acids and negatively charged phosphate groups. This binding mode is strikingly similar to that of most ligands selected for specific G-quadruplex targeting. Binding to an exposed G-tetrad represents a simple and efficient way to specifically target G-quadruplex structures.

[Study on quantity and function of bone marrow macrophages in patients with BMMNC-Coombs Test(+) pancytopenia]. To explore the quantity and function of bone marrow (BM) macrophages in patients with BMMNC-Coombs Test(+) pancytopenia (BCTP). Sixty-one patients with BCTP, 10 with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) and 13 normal controls were enrolled in this study. The quantity of BM macrophages was measured by FACS and their function was evaluated by phagocytosis test. The number of macrophages, phagocytosis ratio and index of cock's red blood cells (CRBC) in BCTP patients were (0.57 +/- 0.30)%, (37.56 +/- 15.20)%, and 0.75 +/- 0.34, respectively, being significantly higher than those in SAA group \[0.46 +/- 0.08)%, (28.26 +/- 10.46)%, and in 0.59 +/- 0.39\] and in normal control \[0.44 +/- 0.69)% (25.63 +/- 14.75)%, and 0.55 +/- 0.16\] (P < 0.05). The BCTP patients were classified into two subgroups according to the quantity of macrophages: Group A (M(Phi) > or = 0.5%, 34 cases) and Group B (M(Phi) < 0.5%, 27 cases). There were 32 cases (94.12%) with BMMNC-IgG(+) in Group A and only 2 cases (7.41%) in Group B. There were significant differences in phagocytosis ratio and index of macrophages between Group A \[46.62 +/- 13.38)% and 0.91 +/- 0.36\] and Group B \[(28.67 +/- 12.59)% and 0.61 +/- 0.30\] (P < 0.05), while no statistical differences between group B and other two control groups (P > 0.05). Thirty-four BMMNC-IgG(+) patients were further divided into two subgroups: High level (HL) group \[> or = 0.75%, 9 cases (26.47%)\] and Low level (LL) group \[< 0.75%, 25 cases (73.53%)\]. Only one lineage of BMMNC-IgG could be detected in LL group. Among 9 patients in HL group, 8(23.53%) had two lineages of BMMNC-IgG and 1(2.94%) had three lineages. Phagocytosis ratio and index of macrophages were significantly higher in HL group \[(60.22 +/- 12.51)% and 1.23 +/- 0.23\] than in LL group \[(43.32 +/- 9.24)% and 0.84 +/- 0.24\] (P < 0.05). The level of peripheral blood(PB) RBC, HGB and PLT in HL group were significantly lower than in LL group (P < 0.05), while the percentage of Ret, the level of TBIL and the ratio of erythroid of sternal BM in HL group were significantly higher than in LL group (P < 0.05). More quantity and stronger function of macrophages are observed in BCTP patients with BMMNC-IgG(+). One of the mechanism of hematocytopenia might be that macrophages activated by IgG autoantibodies phagocytose hematopoietic cells in BM. Macrophages do not involve in damage process of BM in BCTP with IgM or cold autoantibodies.

Reliability and validity of birth certificate prepregnancy weight and height among women enrolled in prenatal WIC program: Florida, 2005. To investigate the reliability and validity of weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) from birth certificates with directly measured values from the Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) Program. Florida birth certificate data were linked and compared with first trimester WIC data for women with a live birth during the last quarter of calendar year 2005 (nÂ =Â 23,314 women). Mean differences for weight, height, and BMI were calculated by subtracting birth certificate values from WIC values. Reliability was estimated by Pearson's correlation. Validity was measured by sensitivity and specificity using WIC data as the reference. Overall mean differences plus or minus standard error (SE) were 1.93Â Â±Â 0.04Â kg for weight, -1.03Â Â±Â 0.03Â cm for height, and 1.07Â Â±Â 0.02Â kg/m(2) for BMI. Pearson's correlation ranged from 0.83 to 0.95, which indicates a strong positive association. Compared with other categories, women in the second weight group (56.7-65.8Â kg), the highest height group (â¥167.6Â cm), or BMIÂ <Â 18.5 had the greatest mean differences for weight (2.2Â Â±Â 0.08Â kg), height (-2.4Â Â±Â 0.05Â cm), and BMI (1.5Â Â±Â 0.06), respectively. Mean differences by maternal characteristics were similar, but statistically significant, likely in part from the large sample size. The sensitivity for birth certificate data was 77.3% (Â±1.42) for underweight (BMIÂ <Â 18.5) and 76.4% (Â±0.51) for obesity (BMIÂ â¥Â 30). Specificity was 96.8% (Â±0.12) for underweight and 97.5% (Â±0.12) for obesity. Birth certificate data had higher underweight prevalence (6 vs. 4%) and lower obesity prevalence (24 vs. 29%), compared with WIC data. Although birth certificate data overestimated underweight and underestimated obesity prevalence, the difference was minimal and has limited impact on the reliability and validity for population-based surveillance and research purposes related to recall or reporting bias.

Effect of pharmaceutical excipients on the stability of trichlormethiazide tablets under humid conditions. The stability of trichlormethiazide (TCM) and the drug in the nine products available on the market (the original tablet (B) and 8 generic tablets (G1-G8)) were investigated under humid conditions. TCM was non-hygroscopic and was not degraded under humid conditions. Drug degradation in aqueous ethanol was accelerated with increased water concentration, and the drug stability in buffer solution was improved with decreased pH. TCM decomposition was not detected in each unwrapped tablet at low relative humidity. However, rapid degradation was observed for products G1 and G2, while product B and G7 showed higher stability at high relative humidity. The stability of products G1 and G2 decreased with increasing humidity. The same results were observed for the tablets in press-through packages (PTP), but the degradation rate was much slower than tablets without PTP packages. These results suggested that the adsorbed moisture by excipients cause TCM degradation. Various pharmaceutical excipients are added to TCM tablets and these vary between different pharmaceutical companies. Intact drug and pharmaceutical excipients, including lactose, microcrystalline cellulose, corn starch, hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), low substituted HPC (L-HPC), calcium stearate, and light anhydrous silicic acid, were mixed, and the sample mixtures were stored in humid conditions. It was found that the TCM content decreased significantly in a binary mixture of TCM/HPC 1 : 1.

Similarities and differences between smoking-related gene expression in nasal and bronchial epithelium. Previous studies have shown that physiological responses to cigarette smoke can be detected via bronchial airway epithelium gene expression profiling and that heterogeneity in this gene expression response to smoking is associated with lung cancer. In this study, we sought to determine the similarity of the effects of tobacco smoke throughout the respiratory tract by determining patterns of smoking-related gene expression in paired nasal and bronchial epithelial brushings collected from 14 healthy nonsmokers and 13 healthy current smokers. Using whole genome expression arrays, we identified 119 genes whose expression was affected by smoking similarly in both bronchial and nasal epithelium, including genes related to detoxification, oxidative stress, and wound healing. While the vast majority of smoking-related gene expression changes occur in both bronchial and nasal epithelium, we also identified 27 genes whose expression was affected by smoking more dramatically in bronchial epithelium than nasal epithelium. Both common and site-specific smoking-related gene expression profiles were validated using independent microarray datasets. Differential expression of select genes was also confirmed by RT-PCR. That smoking induces largely similar gene expression changes in both nasal and bronchial epithelium suggests that the consequences of cigarette smoke exposure can be measured in tissues throughout the respiratory tract. Our findings suggest that nasal epithelial gene expression may serve as a relatively noninvasive surrogate to measure physiological responses to cigarette smoke and/or other inhaled exposures in large-scale epidemiological studies.

Recent progress in percutaneous coronary intervention: evolution of the drug-eluting stents, focus on the XIENCE V drug-eluting stent. Although originally the practice of using balloon catheters proved successful in the short term, the long-term prognosis was less promising because of restenosis, which occurred in >or=30% of patients. This prompted the development of new techniques and mechanical adjuncts, or stents, to maintain lumen patency after balloon angioplasty. Bare metal stents (BMS), the first type of stent used in percutaneous coronary intervention, were designed to address the issues met by balloon angioplasty. BMS reduced the angiographic and clinical restenosis rates in de novo lesions compared to percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty alone and decreased the need for emergency coronary artery bypass graft surgery. BMS substantially reduced the incidence of abrupt artery closure, but restenosis still occurred after 6 months in about 20% of cases, necessitating repeat procedures. Drug-eluting stents (DES) improved on the principle of BMS by also delivering drugs locally to inhibit neointimal hyperplasia. DES greatly reduced the incidence of restenosis and resulted in a better safety profile as compared to radiation or systemic drug administration. These advantages and a lower cost compared to surgical interventions make DES an attractive option to treat coronary artery disease. Currently, five DES are available in the USA: the CYPHER sirolimus-eluting stent from Cordis (approved by FDA on 24 April 2003), the TAXUS Express(2) and LibertÃ© paclitaxel-eluting stents from Boston Scientific (approved by FDA on 4 March 2004 and 10 October 2008, respectively) (hereafter TAXUS Express is referred to as TAXUS), the ENDEAVOR zotarolimus-eluting stent from Medtronic (approved by FDA on 1 February 2008), and the XIENCE V everolimus-eluting stent from Abbott Vascular (approved by FDA on 2 July 2008). Following the approval of CYPHER and TAXUS, the clinical data suggested a potential small increase in the rate of stent thrombosis (ST) in DES compared with BMS after implantation. To determine the differences in ST and other rare events between different stents, some modifications have been made to DES clinical trial design, and postmarket surveillance programs have been included to further evaluate the safety and efficacy of each DES. In this review, we will discuss the key clinical outcomes of DES clinical trials, design and key features of the current coronary stents, and major clinical development programs. Postmarket trials, designed to establish long-term safety around ST and other rare clinical events, are also discussed. The future of DES design technologies will also be outlined.

[Pancreas transplant in Spain: better late than...]. Pancreas transplant is the only method that enables diabetic patients to have a normal carbohydrate metabolism in the long-term. Its application in selected patients has shown to have patient survival rates, at one year of the graft, similar to those transplanted with other solid organs, such as kidney, heart, liver, etc. The indications are currently well established, with combined pancreas-kidney transplant being the most common, followed by pancreas transplant after a functioning kidney transplant and isolated pancreas transplant in pre-uraemic patients. In 2005, in Spain, under the auspices of the National Transplant Organisation (ONT), a consensus meeting was held with the scientific societies involved in this type of transplant, to standardise its indications and highlight its benefits in order to optimise the results of this transplant in our country. The most important conclusions of this consensus meeting are discussed in this short article.

Effect of microcurrent skin patch on the epidural fentanyl requirements for post operative pain relief of total hip arthroplasty. Major orthopedic surgery that cause considerable pain like total hip arthroplasty, requires good post operative pain management. Microcurrent therapy (MCT) is a new therapy whereby electric current is provided in literally millionth of an ampere. MCT comes as two self adherent active electrode patches linked by a cable Efficacy of MCT in the management of musculoskeletal pain and enhancement of wound healing has been reported. To study the effect of microcurrent therapy (MCT) on the epidural fentanyl requirements and degree of wound healing after total hip arthroplasty. Twenty eight patients undergoing total hip replacement (THR) were randomly allocated into two groups. Group I: had micro current skin patches (two adhesive electrode) attached above the site of operation in addition to the lumbar epidural catheter. Post operative epidural fentanyl infusion with a syringe pump given at a rate ranged between 25 and 75 microgram per hour to keep visual analogue pain score (VAS) less than 3/10. Group II had only continuous epidural infusion with fentanyl at the same range to keep VAS less than 3/10 without MCT. There was statistically significant lower mean epidural fentanyl requirement in Group I (23.24 microgram) when compared to Group II (58.36 microgram). There was 23% incidence of dermatitis in Group I due to application of micro- current skin patch which resolved by treatment. There was statistically significant higher frequency of grade 1 of wound healing in the microcurrent group (41.3 %) when compared to Group II (7.2%). Grade 2 and 3 were more frequent in Group II) CONCLUSION: The microcurrent skin therapy lead to reduction in the requirements of the post operative epidural fentanyl with improvement of degrees of wound healing but with considerable incidence of skin dermatitis after total hip arthroplasty.


Access to medical care, use of preventive services, and chronic conditions among adults in substance abuse treatment.

The anatomy and physiology of the venous foot pump. The presence of a venous pumping mechanism in the foot may be significant for venous return in the lower extremities. However, there has been a lack of conclusive research in the area to date and controversy still exists over the detailed anatomy and physiologic mechanism of the venous foot pump. A full understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the venous foot pump is essential for designing effective interventions for the prevention, treatment, and management of venous disease in the lower limbs. This article highlights and discusses the relevant literature relating to the anatomy and physiology of the venous foot pump. In addition, the plantar aspects of 10 cadaveric feet were dissected. These dissections revealed the presence of a previously unreported secondary deep plantar arch and/or deep system of venous connections in the foot and facilitated a more detailed description of the patterns of doubling and branching of the primary veins of the foot. The results of these dissections are discussed within the context of previous work in the field with the aid of detailed diagrams of the dissected feet and may provide a backdrop for the physiology of the venous foot pump and its potential role in lower limb circulation. This is discussed in the last section of the article, which also highlights existing controversy regarding the role of weight bearing and muscular contraction as the dominant mechanisms for venous pumping in the foot.

Free flap breast reconstruction in advanced age: is it safe? Due to perceived medical and surgical risk, patients of advanced age may not be offered free flap breast reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to determine whether complications are actually higher in patients of advanced age. A review of 1031 muscle-sparing free transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous, deep inferior epigastric perforator, and superficial inferior epigastric artery flaps over 15 years was performed. There were 976 patients younger than 65 years and 55 patients aged 65 and older. Population variables, operative variables, and outcome variables were compared. Statistical analysis included chi-square, Fisher's exact, Mann-Whitney, and two-sample t tests. The mean age was 47 years (range, 24 to 79 years). The older group had a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists status (2.1 versus 1.9; p = 0.05), a higher prevalence of hypertension (38 percent versus 18 percent; p < 0.001), a higher average body mass index (30 versus 28; p = 0.039), and lower rates of preoperative (28 percent versus 13 percent; p = 0.016) and postoperative (17 percent versus 2 percent; p = 0.003) chemotherapy. In the older group, more blood transfusions (7 percent versus 2 percent; p = 0.03) were administered and the coupler was used less often (13 percent versus 32 percent; p = 0.009). There was no difference in length of stay (3.5 days), medical complications (4 percent), surgical complications (32 percent), take-backs (1 percent), or revisions (19 percent). Despite higher rates of hypertension, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists status, higher body mass index, and higher rates of blood transfusion, the 65 years and older group had outcomes equal to those of the general population. Thus, free flap breast reconstruction in patients of advanced age is safe, and should be offered when indicated.

[Preparation and properties of poly (acrylic ester) hydrogel as basic materials for intraocular lens]. Poly (acrylic ester) hydrogel materials were widely used in intraocular lens and contact lens because of their excellent optical performance and biocompatibility. In this paper, the bulk copolymerization behavior of hydrophilic hydroxyethyl methacrylat with hydrophobic methyl metharylate was studied; and the optical performance, calcium deposits, equilibrium water content of polymers and its hydrogels obtained by different ratios of monomers were systematically investigated. The experimental results showed that the average light transmittance and the equilibrium water content of the obtained hydrogels increased with the increasing of the hydrophilic monomer content from 0 to 100%; however, the hardness decreased. The highest light transmittance reached 97% and the hardness of Shore A fell from 92 to 25, the equilibrium water content of hydrogel increased from 16% to 64%. The absorbent capacity of copolymers reduced with the adding of cross-linking monomer. When m(hydrophilic monomer): m(hydrophobic monomer) = 90 : 10, the combination property of the polymer and its hydrogel obtained is optimum.

Characterization of a K+-induced conformational switch in a human telomeric DNA oligonucleotide using 2-aminopurine fluorescence. Human telomeric DNA consists of tandem repeats of the DNA sequence d(GGGTTA). Oligodeoxynucleotide telomere models such as d[A(GGGTTA)(3)GGG] (Tel22) fold in a cation-dependent manner into quadruplex structures consisting of stacked G-quartets linked by d(TTA) loops. NMR has shown that in Na(+) solutions Tel22 forms a "basket" topology of four antiparallel strands; in contrast, Tel22 in K(+) solutions consists of a mixture of unknown topologies. Our previous studies on the mechanism of folding of Tel22 and similar telomere analogues utilized changes in UV absorption between 270 and 325 nm that report primarily on G-quartet formation and stacking showed that quadruplex formation occurs within milliseconds upon mixing with an appropriate cation. In this study, we assess the dynamics and equilibria of folding of specific loops by using Tel22 derivatives in which the dA residues were serially substituted with the fluorescent reporter base, 2-aminopurine (2-AP). Tel22 folding induced by Na(+) or K(+) assessed by changes in 2-AP fluorescence consists of at least three kinetic steps with time constants spanning a range from milliseconds to several hundred seconds. Na(+)-dependent equilibrium titrations of Tel22 folding could be approximated as a cooperative two-state process. In contrast, K(+)-dependent folding curves were biphasic, revealing that different conformational ensembles are present in 1 and 30 mM K(+). This conclusion was confirmed by (1)H NMR. Molecular dynamics simulations revealed a K(+) binding pocket in Tel22 located near dA1 that is specific for the so-called hybrid-1 conformation in which strand 1 is in a parallel arrangement. The possible presence of this topologically specific binding site suggests that K(+) may play an allosteric role in regulating telomere conformation and function by modulating quadruplex tertiary structure.

Timing of the initial muscle biopsy does not affect the measured muscle protein fractional synthesis rate during basal, postabsorptive conditions. The muscle protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR) is determined by monitoring the incorporation of an amino acid tracer into muscle protein during a constant-rate intravenous tracer infusion. Commonly two sequential muscle biopsies are obtained some time after starting the tracer infusion. However, other protocols, including those with an initial biopsy before starting the tracer infusion to measure the background enrichment and those with only a single biopsy after several hours of tracer infusion have been used. To assess the validity of these approaches, we compared the muscle protein FSR obtained by calculating the difference in [ring-(2)H(5)]phenylalanine and [5,5,5-(2)H(3)]leucine incorporation into muscle protein at approximately 3.5 h after starting the tracer infusion and 1) at 60 min; 2) before starting the tracer infusion (background enrichment); 3) a population average muscle protein background enrichment; and 4) by measuring the tracer incorporation into muscle protein at approximately 3.5 h assuming essentially no background enrichment. Irrespective of the tracer used, the muscle protein FSR calculated from the difference in the muscle protein labeling several hours after starting the tracer infusion and either the labeling at 60 min or the background enrichment were not different (e.g., 0.049 +/- 0.007%/h vs. 0.049 +/- 0.007%/h, respectively, with [(2)H(5)]phenylalanine; P = 0.99). However, omitting the initial biopsy and assuming no background enrichment yielded average FSR values that were approximately 15% (with [(2)H(5)]phenylalanine) to 80% (with [(2)H(3)]leucine) greater (P < or = 0.059); using a population average background enrichment reduced the difference to approximately 3% (P = 0.76) and 22% (P = 0.52) with [(2)H(5)]phenylalanine and [(2)H(3)]leucine, respectively. We conclude that during basal, postabsorptive conditions, valid muscle protein FSR values can be obtained irrespective of the timing of the initial biopsy so long as the protein labeling in two sequential biopsies is measured whereas the single biopsy approach should be avoided.

Coloboma and CHARGE association in Puerto Rico. Previous studies have reported that patients with the CHARGE association have congenital anomalies including: Coloboma; heart defects; choanal atresia, retarded growth and development; genital hypoplasia; and ear anomalies. Ocular findings in patients with the association include: poor visual acuity; anisometropia; myopic astigmatism; strabismus; microcornea; cataracts; staphyloma; and reduced stereopsis. We conducted a non-concurrent prospective study of 13 patients with coloboma from Puerto Rico. Seven patients out of the 13 patients (53.8%) had the CHARGE association. Age ranged from 10 to 84 (mean = 38 years). Ocular findings in all the patients with coloboma include: nystagmus; strabismus; poor visual acuity; refractive errors; microcornea; cataracts; glaucoma; and dry eyes. Patients in our study had systemic findings such as: heart defects; ear anomalies; and endocrine problems. To our knowledge this is the first case series of patients with Coloboma and the CHARGE association reported in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean basin.

Kindler syndrome. Kindler syndrome (MIM173650) is an autosomal recessive genodermatosis characterized by poikiloderma, trauma-induced skin blistering, mucosal inflammation, and photosensitivity. Loss-of-function mutations in the FERMT1 gene are the cause of Kindler syndrome. Kindler syndrome is categorized as a subtype of epidermolysis bullosa (EB). During infancy and childhood, there is clinical overlap between Kindler syndrome and dystrophic EB. Unlike other forms of EB, Kindler syndrome is characterized by impaired actin cytoskeleton-extracellular matrix interactions and a variable plane of blister formation at or close to the dermal-epidermal junction. This article reviews clinicopathologic and molecular features of Kindler syndrome and discusses patient management.

Flexion-extension motion assistance using an upper limb motion-assist robot based on trajectory estimation of reaching movement. People of all ages have suffered impairment in traffic accidents or sport accidents, and these individuals worry about dysfunction of their upper limbs, but they can recover from dysfunction by rehabilitation. In this study, we developed an assistive robot for upper limb movement that has high rehabilitation effectiveness. To achieve this, we proposed a reaching movement support method that considers an expanding joint's range of motion. The effectiveness of our method is shown through experiments.

Diffusion-weighted imaging in the abdomen and pelvis: concepts and applications. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging allows the detection of focal solid and cystic lesions in the abdomen and pelvis and, if pitfalls are to be avoided, is most effectively used in conjunction with other imaging sequences. It is important to recognize that the strength of the diffusion sensitizing gradient (b value) can and should be adjusted to ensure optimal evaluation of the body region or organ being imaged, and that more than one b value is necessary for tissue characterization. The success of lesion detection and characterization largely depends on the extent of tissue cellularity because increased cellularity is associated with impeded diffusion, as indicated by a reduction in the apparent diffusion coefficient. It is also important to recognize that certain normal tissues such as the endometrium are highly cellular and as such demonstrate restricted diffusion, which should not be misinterpreted as disease. Impeded diffusion can also be seen in highly viscous cystic lesions such as abscesses. Diffusion-weighted imaging is an evolving technology with the potential to improve tissue characterization when findings are interpreted in conjunction with findings obtained with other conventional MR imaging sequences.


Cortical surface characteristics among offspring of schizophrenia subjects.

Decreased kainate receptors in the hippocampus of apolipoprotein D knockout mice. Apolipoprotein D (ApoD) has many actions critical to maintaining mammalian CNS function. It is therefore significant that levels of ApoD have been shown to be altered in the CNS of subjects with schizophrenia, suggesting a role for ApoD in the pathophysiology of the disorder. There is also a large body of evidence that cortical and hippocampal glutamatergic, serotonergic and cholinergic systems are affected by the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Thus, we decided to use in vitro radioligand binding and autoradiography to measure levels of ionotropic glutamate, some muscarinic and serotonin 2A receptors in the CNS of ApoD(-/-) and isogenic wild-type mice. These studies revealed a 20% decrease (mean+/-SEM: 104+/-10.2 vs. 130+/-10.4 fmol/mg ETE) in the density of kainate receptors in the CA 2-3 of the ApoD(-/-) mice. In addition there was a global decrease in AMPA receptors (F(1,214)=4.67, p<0.05) and a global increase in muscarinic M2/M4 receptors (F(1,208)=22.77, p<0.0001) in the ApoD(-/-) mice that did not reach significance in any single cytoarchitectural region. We conclude that glutamatergic pathways seem to be particularly affected in ApoD(-/-) mice and this may contribute to the changes in learning and memory, motor tasks and orientation-based tasks observed in these animals, all of which involve glutamatergic neurotransmission.

Management of facial bite wounds. Bite wounds are especially prone to infectious complications, both local and systemic. In bite wounds to the face, such complications can create more difficulties than the initial tissue damage itself for the task of restoring an esthetic appearance. Management should aim to neutralize this potential for infection and provide an infection-free environment for wound healing. Wound cleansing followed by primary closure is the treatment of choice, and the use of prophylactic antibiotics may further decrease the risk of infection. Delay in presentation beyond 24 hours is not necessarily a contraindication to immediate repair, but excessive crushing of the tissues or extensive edema usually dictates a more conservative approach, such as delayed closure.

Hippocampal damage produces retrograde but not anterograde amnesia for a cued location in a spontaneous exploratory task in rats. Performance in several memory tasks is known to be unaffected by hippocampal damage sustained before learning, but is severely disrupted if the same damage occurs after learning. Memories for preferred locations, or home bases, in exploratory tasks can be formed by rats with hippocampal damage, but it is unknown if the memory for a home base survives hippocampal damage. To examine this question, for 30 min each day for five consecutive days, rats explored a circular open field containing one local cue. By Day 5 the rats preferentially went directly to that location, spent the majority of their time at that location, made rapid direct trips to that location when returning from an excursion and so demonstrated that the location was a home base. Memory for the cued location was examined after a 24 h or 14-day interval with the cue removed. In Experiments 1 and 2, control rats and rats with prior N-methyl-D-aspartic acid hippocampal lesions demonstrated memory of the home base location by making direct trips to that location. In Experiment 3, rats that had first explored the open field and cue and then received hippocampal lesions showed no memory for the cued location. The absence of anterograde impairment vs. the presence of retrograde impairment for memory of a spatial home base confirms a role for the hippocampus in the retention of spatial memory acquired during exploration.


Needlestick injuries among medical students: incidence and implications.

[A Case Report of Successful Chemotherapy with Tegafur/Gimeracil/Oteracil and Nab-Paclitaxel for Gastric Cancer with Chronic Renal Failure]. An 80-year-old Japanese woman with chronic renal failure was diagnosed with gastric cancer and 2 primary colon cancers. The colon cancers were treated with laparoscopic colectomy, but the gastric cancer metastasized to the liver with inoperable dissemination. After operative treatment of the colon cancers, 1 year of combination chemotherapy consisting of tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil (TS-1Â®) and nab-PTX was administered to treat the advanced gastric cancer. Tegafur is a well-known prodrug of 5-FU. Serum densitometry of 5-FU was performed to determine the correct dose of TS-1Â®. After completion of chemotherapy, no tumor was detected on gastroscopy or dynamic computed tomography. The patient was well with no recurrence 6 months after completion of chemotherapy. CDDP, CPT-11, 5-FU, PTX, and DTX are known chemotherapy agents for treating gastric cancer. Renal excretion is not involved in the metabolism of CPT-11, 5-FU, PTX, or DTX. These agents are metabolized in the liver. CPT-11 metabolism depends on individual hepatic enzymes. Therefore, we believe that nab-PTX and TS-1Â® are safe and effective agents for patients with chronic renal failure and advanced gastric cancer. Additionally, we also conclude that using serum densitometry of 5-FU to guide the administration of TS-1Â® can improve both safety and efficacy.

An Interleukin-33-Mast Cell-Interleukin-2 Axis Suppresses Papain-Induced Allergic Inflammation by Promoting Regulatory T Cell Numbers. House dust mite-derived proteases contribute to allergic disorders in part by disrupting epithelial barrier function. Interleukin-33 (IL-33), produced by lung cells after exposure to protease allergens, can induce innate-type airway eosinophilia by activating natural helper (NH) cells, a member of group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2), to secrete Th2 type-cytokines. Because IL-33 also can induce mast cells (MCs) toÂ secrete Th2 type-cytokines, MCs are thought toÂ cooperate with NH cells in enhancing protease orÂ IL-33-mediated innate-type airway eosinophilia. However, we found that MC-deficient Kit(W-sh/W-sh) mice exhibited exacerbated protease-induced lung inflammation associated with reduced numbers of regulatory T (Treg) cells. Moreover, IL-2 produced by IL-33-stimulated MCs promoted expansion of numbers of Treg cells, thereby suppressing development of papain- or IL-33-induced airway eosinophilia. We have thus identified a unique anti-inflammatory pathway that can limit induction of innate-type allergic airway inflammation mediated by NH cells.

Determination of gallium at trace levels using a spectrofluorimetric method in synthetic U-Ga and Ga-As solutions. A simple, easy to use and selective spectrofluorimetric method for the determination of trace levels of gallium has been developed. A new Schiff base, N-o-vanillidine-2-amino-p-cresol (OVAC) was synthesized and its fluorescence activity with gallium investigated. Based on this chelation reaction, a spectrofluorimetric method has been developed for the determination of gallium in synthetically prepared Ga-U and Ga-As samples buffered at pH 4.0 using acetic acid-sodium acetate. The chelation reaction between Ga(III) and N-o-vanillidine-2-amino-p-cresol was very fast, requiring only 30min at room temperature to complex completely. The limit of detection (LOD) (3sigma) for Ga(III) was 7.17 nM (0.50 microgL(-1)), determined from the analysis of 11 different solutions of 20 microg L(-1) Ga(III).

Aeromonas septicemia after medicinal leech use following replantation of severed digits. Medicinal leeches are used to control venous congestion. Aeromonas in the leech gut are essential for digestion of blood. This case report describes a patient who had Aeromonas bacteremia develop after leeching. He had an injury to his hand that required replantation of his thumb. Following the surgery, leech therapy was started with ampicillin-sulbactam prophylaxis. Sepsis developed. Blood cultures were positive for Aeromonas that were resistant to ampicillin-sulbactam. The antibiotic was changed to ciprofloxacin on the basis of the sensitivity profile of the organisms. Cultures from the leech bathwater confirmed it as the source of the Aeromonas. Clinicians who use leech therapy must be aware that leeches can harbor Aeromonas species resistant to accepted prophylactic antibiotics and that sepsis may occur.

Trajectories of recovery of social and physical functioning in major depression, dysthymic disorder and double depression: a 3-year follow-up. Depressive disorders have a large impact on psychosocial functioning. Since lower functioning predicts recurrence of a depressive episode, insight into the post-morbid course of psychosocial functioning of persons with different depressive disorders may facilitate recurrence prevention. Data were derived from NEMESIS, an epidemiologic survey in the adult population in the Netherlands. Respondents, who met the CIDI criteria of major depression (MDD; n=102), dysthymic disorder (Dysth; n=66) or double depression (DD; n=73) at baseline, and recovered during three year follow-up, were included; as was a control group without any diagnosis (NoDiag, n=4140). Functioning was assessed using the Groningen Social Disability Schedule (GSDS) and the SF-36 physical health summary-scale. Linear Mixed Models were conducted to compare 3-year trajectories of functioning across depressive groups and with NoDiag group. Compared to NoDiag, all depressed groups were significantly impaired on social and physical functioning. Dysth and DD had a lower level of post-morbid physical functioning compared to MDD (after 1 and 3 years respectively: Dysth: B=-13.8, p=.002 and B=-8.11, p=.09; DD: B=-8.9, p=.03 and B=-9.1, p=.05). Determinants for impaired social functioning (neuroticism) and for impaired physical functioning (age, comorbid somatic disorders and neuroticism) were identified. Attrition was higher among persons with a depression. Inclusion of the drop-outs would most likely have resulted in stronger associations, since we expect lower functioning among the drop-outs. This study indicates the long-term debilitating effects of psychopathology, even after recovery of depressive disorders. Duration of the index symptoms appears to be associated with impaired functioning, since especially those with Dysthymia (either with or without a MDD) showed slower and less recovery of functioning.

Bioinformatics analysis of the gene expression profiles in human intervertebral disc degeneration associated with inflammatory cytokines. To investigate the microarray data on the gene expression profiles of intervertebral disc degeneration related to cytokine exposure. The purpose of the study was to identify the key genes that were differentially expressed in these disc cells compared to cells without inflammatory cytokine treatment, using bioinformatics analyses, and to explore the related signaling pathways and interaction networks, providing clues to the molecular mechanisms of disc degeneration for future experimental studies. The gene expression profiles data were obtained using the same microarray platform for two groups of patients suffering from degenerative disc diseases: GSE41883 (Human annulus disc cells exposed to TNF-a; 4 samples) and GSE27494 (Human annulus disc cells exposed to IL-1Î²; 4 samples). The genes that were differentially expressed in these two datasets compared to control disc cells (without cytokine exposure; 4 samples each) were identified using the R language, and were pooled using the Excel software program to select the common differentially expressed genes in the two datasets. The initial functional clustering, signaling pathways and protein-protein interaction relationship analyses were conducted using the DAVID and STRING software programs. Of the 255 concomitantly and differentially expressed genes identified after respective treatment with TNF-Î± and IL-1Î², 141 were up-regulated and 114 were down-regulated. The gene ontology annotation analysis showed that these differentially expressed genes were primarily associated with cytokine activity, growth factor activity, the inflammatory reaction and the response to injury. The signaling pathway analysis showed that these differentially expressed genes were mainly related to the interactions of cytokines, apoptosis and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. The interaction network analysis indicated that PTGS2, ICAM1, NOV and other genes may play a role in disc degeneration. We found that ICAM1 and other genes may play a role in the development of disc degeneration induced by inflammatory reactions using a bioinformatics analysis of the gene expression profiles of degenerative intervertebral disc cells stimulated with inflammatory factors, suggesting that bioinformatics methods can be used to identify potential target for intervertebral disc degeneration.

Realistic simulation of transcranial direct current stimulation via 3-d high-resolution finite element analysis: Effect of tissue anisotropy. Recently, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is getting an attentions as a promising technique with a capability of noninvasive and nonconvulsive stimulation to treat ill conditions of the brain such as depression. However, knowledge on how exactly tDCS affects the activity of neurons in the brain is still not sufficient. Precise analysis on the electromagnetic effect of tDCS on the brain requires finite element analysis (FEA) with realistic head models including anisotropy of the white matter and the skull. In this paper, we have simulated tDCS via 3-D high-resolution FEA and investigated the effect of tissue anisotropy on tDCS. The results show that the skull anisotropy induces a strong shunting effect, causing a shift of the stimulated areas, and the white matter anisotropy affects strongly the current flow directions, changing the current field distribution inside the human brain. Our presented methodology and results should be useful for more effective guiding and treatment using tDCS.

Effect of Nitrogen Fertilization and Harvest Time on Steviol Glycosides, Flavonoid Composition, and Antioxidant Properties in Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni. This work investigated the effect of nitrogen fertilization and harvest time on the flavonoid composition and antioxidant properties of Stevia rebaudiana leaves. At the same time, changes in stevioside (Stev) and rebaudioside A (RebA) contents were recorded. A pot trial under open air conditions was set up, testing five N rates and three harvest times. The results showed that, by using an adequate N rate and choosing an appropriate harvest time, it was possible to significantly increase and optimize the bioactive compound levels. In particular, higher RebA, RebA/Stev ratio, total phenols and flavonoids, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, and apigenin-7-O-glucoside levels and antioxidant capacity were recorded by supplying 150 kg N ha(-1). Reduced or increased N availability in comparison with N150 had no consistent effect on Stevia phytochemicals content. Significant correlations were also found between stevioside and some of the flavonoids, indicating a possible role of flavonoids in the stevioside metabolic pathway, which deserves more investigations.

Prevalence of type 2 diabetes in patients with obstructive sleep apnea in a multi-ethnic sample.

Diet quality of preschool children and maternal perceptions/misperceptions: the GENESIS study. To quantify maternal perceptions regarding the quality of their child's diet, and to identify factors associated with misperceptions. A representative sample of 2287 children aged 2-5 years from a cross-sectional study (GENESIS study) was used. Maternal perceptions of the quality of their child's diet, child's and mother's anthropometric characteristics, and other characteristics (i.e. socio-demographic and lifestyle) were recorded. The actual quality of each child's diet was estimated using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score. Based on the HEI score, 18.3% of participants had a 'poor' diet, 81.5% had a diet which 'needs improvement' and only 0.2% had a 'good' diet. Almost 83% of mothers overestimated the quality of their child's diet. The overestimation rate was 86% among mothers who declared that they choose their child's food based on what they consider to be healthy, and 72% among those who reported that other factors play the predominant role in food choices for their child (P<0.001). Moreover, total energy intake as well as the intake of fruits, grains, vegetables, meat and milk was significantly higher among children whose mothers overestimated the quality of their diet. The vast majority of mothers overestimate the quality of their child's diet. Given that maternal perceptions regarding the quality of their child's diet are likely to be one of the predominant factors determining the child's food intake, health professionals should make mothers aware of the existence of particular dietary recommendations that their children should meet in order to eat a healthy diet.

Bone mass and sex steroids in postmenarcheal adolescents and adult women with Type 1 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to compare the bone mass in young adolescents and adult women with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and determine its relationship with sex steroid and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels. Cross-sectional study. We studied a group of adolescents and adult women with T1DM (n=45) and 50 healthy controls (C) matched by gynecological age and body mass index in a case-control study. Girls with menarche within the last 18-40 months (n=17 T1DM and 32 C) and adult women (age=30.4+1.4 years; n=28 T1DM and 18 C) were recruited. Bone mass was evaluated with a GE Lunar Prodigy densitometer. Sex steroid levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Bone mass was lower in adolescents with T1DM than in control adolescents, but was similar in both groups of postmenarcheal girls after adjusting for age, lean, and fat mass. However, adult T1DM women exhibited lower adjusted and unadjusted (P<.05) Z-femoral neck (-0.2Â±0.2 vs. 0.4Â±0.2) and bone mineral content (BMC) (2306Â±61 vs. 2645Â±79 g) than adult controls. Adult controls and T1DM adults showed higher whole body BMC than adolescent controls and T1DM adolescents, respectively. Bone mass in T1DM did not correlate with estradiol, free estradiol, testosterone, SHBG, or HbA1c levels. The diminished bone mass observed in adult T1DM women does not appear to be related to sex steroid levels. In young adolescents with T1DM, the observed decrease in bone mass appears to be related to differences in body composition and age.

The efficacy and safety of irbesartan in primary hypertension even if a dose is missed: Results from the NO PROBLEM Study. This study aimed to demonstrate that irbesartan is successful in reducing diastolic blood pressure (BP) even following a missed dose after 6-8-weeks' treatment as measured by 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). Eighty-eight patients (64 females, mean age: 53.4 +/- 10.6 years) with primary hypertension were included in this national, single-center, single-arm, open-label, prospective clinical study. Irbesartan (150 or 300 mg/day) was administered for 8 weeks. All patients were asked to cease treatment for 1 day during weeks 6-8. Changes in diastolic and mean 24-hour BP on the day of cessation and diastolic BP values during visits were efficacy parameters. Adverse events were also recorded. Systolic, diastolic, and mean BP values measured via ABPM before and on the day of a missed dose did not differ significantly. Irbesartan effectively controlled BP of the patients. BP normalization rates were 54% for 150 mg/day irbesartan only and 77% for both doses (150 or 300 mg/day) of irbesartan. None of the patients experienced serious adverse events throughout the study period. Irbesartan is successful and safe in the control of BP levels even following a missed dose at the end of a 6-8-week treatment period.

Endogenous blood maximal interferon-gamma production may predict response to interferon-gamma 1beta treatment in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is an untreatable lung disorder with a mean survival of 3 years after diagnosis. Treatment with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) 1beta has been reported to significantly improve lung function and arterial oxygen saturation in a first randomized controlled trial; unexpectedly, these findings have not been confirmed in a subsequent large placebo-controlled randomized study. Another larger placebo-controlled randomized trial has been stopped because data analyzed at interim analysis excluded the possibility that treatment with IFN-gamma 1beta would cause a significant reduction in the risk of death. Seven Italian male patients diagnosed with IPF were treated with IFN-gamma 1beta (200 microg/die subcutaneously three times a week), accordingly to the indications of the Italian Drug Agency. Based on available studies the response to treatment was pre-defined as changes in either lung function (FVC and DLCO) or oxygen arterial saturation. All patients consented to provide a peripheral blood sample for endogenous IFN-gamma production measurement with the ELISpot assay before treatment and 6 months thereafter. Four of 7 patients improved or stabilized their lung function after 6 months treatment. Using the ELISpot assay to quantify the maximal production of endogenous IFN-gamma on peripheral blood samples, these 4 patients had a significantly higher endogenous IFN-gamma production before therapy, as compared to the 3 patients who deteriorated (91.3 +/- 49.6 vs. 277.8 +/- 34.2 spot forming cells, p = 0.023). No significant differences were observed after 6 months of treatment. These preliminary results suggest that some IPF patients might benefit from treatment with IFN-gamma 1beta and may help to interpret the results of large randomized trials, suggesting that individual susceptibility could determine clinical response to treatment.

[Etiology and outcome of liver granulomatosis: a retrospective study of 21 cases]. To assess the etiologies and outcome of liver granulomatosis. We analyzed all consecutive liver granulomatosis diagnosed in our internal medicine department from 2000 to 2008. Among 471 liver biopsies, 21 disclosed evidence of liver granulomatosis (4.5%), in sixteen women (76%) and five men, with a median age of 41years. Thirteen were caucasians (62%). At the time of diagnosis, six (28.5%) had isolated abnormal liver function tests, and fifteen (71.4%) presented with clinical manifestations. The underlying cause was identified in 18 cases (85.7%). Eleven (52.3%) were systemic diseases: five (23.8%) primary biliary cirrhosis, two (9.5%) primary sclerosing cholangitis, two (9.5%) common variable immunodeficiency, one (4.7%) SjÃ¶gren's syndrome, and one (4.7%) BehÃ§et's disease. Two (9.5%) patients had sarcoidosis. Three (14.3%) liver granulomatosis were of infectious origin (tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, and hepatitis C virus), two (9.5%) were neoplastic (Hodgkin's lymphoma and liver cell adenoma), and three (14.3%) were idiopathic. With a median of 38 months of follow-up, four patients (19%, two common variable immunodeficiency and two sarcoidosis) developed portal hypertension, independently of cirrhosis. One patient died of cryptococcosis. In accordance with other European studies, systemic diseases are the main causes of hepatic granulomas. Liver granulomatosis related to common variable immunodeficiency and sarcoidosis are at risk of portal hypertension.

High lipophilicity of meta Mn(III) N-alkylpyridylporphyrin-based superoxide dismutase mimics compensates for their lower antioxidant potency and makes them as effective as ortho analogues in protecting superoxide dismutase-deficient Escherichia coli. Lipophilicity/bioavailibility of Mn(III) N-alkylpyridylporphyrin-based superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimics has a major impact on their in vivo ability to suppress oxidative stress. Meta isomers are less potent SOD mimics than ortho analogues but are 10-fold more lipophilic and more planar. Enhanced lipophilicity contributes to their higher accumulation in cytosol of SOD-deficient Escherichia coli, compensating for their lower potency; consequently, both isomers exert similar-to-identical protection of SOD-deficient E. coli. Thus meta isomers may be prospective therapeutics as are ortho porphyrins.

Anti-platelet factor 4/heparin antibody is associated with progression of peripheral arterial disease in hemodialysis patients. Heparin therapy may induce anti-platelet factor 4/heparin antibody (PF4-H Ab). Hemodialysis patients receive scheduled heparin and are at a risk of developing PF4-H Ab. Hemodialysis patients are also at a high risk of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This study examines whether chronic PF4-H Ab exposure contributes to the progression of PAD measured by ankle brachial index (ABI) in hemodialysis patients. A total of 71 hemodialysis patients were enrolled, and the association between clinical, biochemical parameters and ABI after 3 years was studied. PF4-H Ab was evaluated by ELISA, and patients with titer â¥ 0.4 were taken as having PF4-H Ab. Mean ABI was 1.04 Â± 0.18 at baseline and 1.01 Â± 0.17 after 3 years. Mean ÎABI (change in ABI after 3 years) was -0.04 Â± 0.13. PF4-H Ab was positive in 26 patients. PF4-H Ab was not related to hemodialysis duration, DM history, smoking and age. Platelet count showed no correlation with PF4-H Ab. However, there was significance in ÎABI between PF4-H Ab-positive and PF4-H Ab-negative patients (p = 0.002). ÎABI was negatively correlated with PF4-H Ab and 3-year averaged serum Ca Ã P only (Î² = -0.378, p = 0.001; Î² = -0.263, p = 0.018, respectively). However, in PF4-H Ab-positive patients, the extent of ÎABI did not correlate with PF4-H Ab titers (r = -0.021, p = 0.921). PF4-H Ab positivity, along with high levels of serum Ca Ã P, played a potential role in the progression of PAD over time.

Cardiac cirrhosis: a rare manifestation of an uncorrected primum atrial septal defect. Atrial septal defects constitute the second most common cardiac congenital abnormality. These defects when undiagnosed during childhood, present in adulthood with symptoms of right heart failure. We describe a case of uncorrected ostium primum atrial septal defect that presented as liver failure in a 43-year-old woman. The patient was found to have liver cirrhosis and a complete work-up of hepatic causes for cirrhosis was negative. Further examination revealed an atrial primum septal defect. Liver cirrhosis in this patient was thought to be secondary to chronic congestion from the right heart failure resulting from the atrial septal defect. Although right heart failure is a known cause of cirrhosis, liver cirrhosis resulting specifically from an atrial septal defect is uncommon. In fact, an ostium primum atrial septal defect presenting as liver cirrhosis has not been well described. We present such a case to highlight this manifestation of atrial septal defect and also to reiterate that cardiac causes should always be considered in the differential diagnosis whenever a patient presents with liver cirrhosis.

Cre/loxP-regulated transgenic zebrafish model for neural progenitor-specific oncogenic Kras expression. Ras proteins regulate signaling pathways that control many cellular responses, such as proliferation, survival, and differentiation. However, there are intriguing questions about the relationship between the developmental timing of specific mutations and the resultant phenotypes in individual cells. In this study, we used the Cre/loxP system for maintaining transgenic zebrafish lines harboring oncogenic Kras(V12) under the nestin promoter, and investigated the developmental effects of Ras activation in neural progenitor cells. Activated human Kras(V12) was induced within pDSNesLCherryLEGFPKRas(V12) transgenic fish by Cre mRNA injection. Cre-mediated gene excision was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction, and the injected embryos were investigated for Kras(V12) effects using the hemotoxylin-eosin staining, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated digoxigenin-dUTP nick-end labeling assay, and in situ hybridization. pDSNesLCherryLEGFPKRas(V12) transgenic embryos normally expressed mCherry in their central nervous system throughout the developmental stage. However, Cre mRNA injection efficiently excised the flanking stop sequence, and the injected embryos expressed enhanced green fluorescent protein in their brain with severe edema. Brain histology showed that neuronal cell differentiation could occur in spite of oncogenic Kras(V12) overexpression, but massive apoptosis and brain edema caused early embryonal death. In summary, the overexpression of Kras(V12) induces extensive apoptosis of neural progenitor cells followed by severe edema of the brain. However, some neural progenitor cells are resistant to Kras(V12) and can retain their ability to differentiate into neurons. Finally, our transgenic model demonstrates the inability of Kras(V12) alone to induce brain tumors at the early stage of development.

Effects of dexamethasone on pulmonary and renal functions in patients undergoing CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass. This study evaluates whether dexamesathone in patients undergoing CABG using CPB results in better renal and pulmonary outcome. 100 patients were randomized to receive either placebo or dexamethasone (1 mg/ kg, at induction of anesthesia and 0.5 mg/kg 8 h later). The differences regarding pulmonary parameters over times were significant in relation to measurements taken 10 minutes after intubation within groups; nevertheless, differences were significant between groups only at 12, 24 hours for A-a O(2) gradient, respiratory index, PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio. Dexamethasone had no effect on extubation time. Creatinine clearance, urinary micro albumin excretion and (NAG) levels were comparable in both the groups. The dexamethasone treated patients were more likely to have hyperglycemia. Dexamethasone offers no renal protective effect and the drug is associated with significant improvement in A-a O(2) gradient, respiratory index, PaO(2)/FiO( 2) at 12, 24 hours postoperatively and had no effect on extubation time and lung compliance.


The TGF-beta1 dynamics during radiation therapy and its correlation to symptomatic radiation pneumonitis in lung cancer patients.

PDbase: a database of Parkinson's disease-related genes and genetic variation using substantia nigra ESTs. Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders, clinically characterized by impaired motor function. Since the etiology of PD is diverse and complex, many researchers have created PD-related research resources. However, resources for brain and PD studies are still lacking. Therefore, we have constructed a database of PD-related gene and genetic variations using the substantia nigra (SN) in PD and normal tissues. In addition, we integrated PD-related information from several resources. We collected the 6,130 SN expressed sequenced tags (ESTs) from brain SN normal tissues and PD patients SN tissues using full-cDNA library and normalized cDNA library construction methods from our previous study. The SN ESTs were clustered in 2,951 unigene clusters and assigned in 2,678 genes. We then found up-regulated 57 genes and down-regulated 48 genes by comparing normal and PD SN ESTs frequencies with over 0.9 cut-off probability of differential expression based on the Audic and Claverie method. In addition, we integrated disease-related information from public resources. To examine the characteristics of these PD-related genes, we analyzed alternative splicing events, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers located in the gene regions, repeat elements, gene regulation elements, and pathways and protein-protein interaction networks. We constructed the PDbase database to capture the PD-related gene, genetic variation, and functional elements. This database contains 2,698 PD-related genes through ESTs discovered from human normal and PD patients SN tissues, and through integrating several public resources. PDbase provides the mitochondrion proteins, microRNA gene regulation elements, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers within PD-related gene structures, repeat elements, and pathways and networks with protein-protein interaction information. The PDbase information can aid in understanding the causation of PD. It is available at http://bioportal.kobic.re.kr/PDbase/. Supplementary data is available at http://bioportal.kobic.re.kr/PDbase/suppl.jsp.

Differential transcriptomic responses of Biomphalaria glabrata (Gastropoda, Mollusca) to bacteria and metazoan parasites, Schistosoma mansoni and Echinostoma paraensei (Digenea, Platyhelminthes). A 70-mer-oligonucleotide-based microarray (1152 features) that emphasizes stress and immune responses factors was constructed to study transcriptomic responses of the snail Biomphalaria glabrata to different immune challenges. In addition to sequences with relevant putative ID and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, the array features non-immune factors and unknown B. glabrata ESTs for functional gene discovery. The transcription profiles of B. glabrata (3 biological replicates, each a pool of 5 snails) were recorded at 12h post-wounding, exposure to Gram negative or Gram positive bacteria (Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus, respectively), or infection with compatible trematode parasites (Schistosoma mansoni or Echinostoma paraensei, 20 miracidia/snail), relative to controls, using universal reference RNA. The data were subjected to Significance Analysis for Microarrays (SAM), with a false positive rate (FPR) <or=10%. Wounding yielded a modest differential expression profile (27 up/21 down) with affected features mostly dissimilar from other treatments. Partially overlapping, yet distinct expression profiles were recorded from snails challenged with E. coli (83 up/20 down) or M. luteus (120 up/42 down), mostly showing up-regulation of defense and stress-related features. Significantly altered expression of selected immune features indicates that B. glabrata detects and responds differently to compatible trematodes. Echinostoma paraensei infection was associated mostly with down-regulation of many (immune-) transcripts (42 up/68 down), whereas S. mansoni exposure yielded a preponderance of up-regulated features (140 up/23 down), with only few known immune genes affected. These observations may reflect the divergent strategies developed by trematodes during their evolution as specialized pathogens of snails to negate host defense responses. Clearly, the immune defenses of B. glabrata distinguish and respond differently to various immune challenges.

[Anti-inflammatory effects of erythropoietin on hyperoxia-induced bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborn rats]. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a multifactorial disease resulting from the impact of injury (including oxygen toxicity, barotrauma, volutrauma, and infection) on the immature lung. Oxygen toxicity is thought to be a major contributing factor in the pathogenesis in BPD. Previous animal studies have shown that exposure to hyperoxia in the neonatal period causes lung structural changes that are similar to the histology seen in human infants with BPD. Erythropoietin (EPO) has pleiotropic actions including antioxidant, anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and angiogenic effects. Animal experiments reveal that EPO may have protective effects on hyperoxic lung injury, but the mechanisms remain unknown. The aim of the study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory effects and understand mechanism of action of EPO on the hyperoxia-induced BPD in newborn rats. Several litters of Wistar pups were pooled together within 12 hours after birth and randomly divided into four groups: I. air-exposed control group, II. air-exposed human recombinant erythropoietin (rhEPO)-treated group, III. hyperoxia-exposed placebo group and IV. hyperoxia-exposed rhEPO-treated group . Group III and IV rats were exposed to 85% oxygen. Group II and IV rats received rhEPO (1200 IU/kg) subcutaneously on postnatal days 0 and 2. Group I and III received 0.9% saline in the same way. Pups from each group were sacrificed on days 3, 7, and 14. Blood hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit and platelet count were determined by blood cell analyzer. Total protein content in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were measured by biochemical assay. Changes of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1) mRNA expressions were measured by RT-PCR. In group III, there were a few inflammatory cells infiltrations in interstitium on day 3 and inflammatory response worsened on day 7. Alveolar and capillary hypoplasia and interstitial fibrosis were evident on day 14. The pathological changes were ameliorated greatly in group IV and the survival was prolonged. There were no abnormal raises of hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit and platelet count in group IV compared with group I. Total protein concentration in BALF was measured as a marker for capillary leakage. MPO is a major constituent of neutrophil cytoplasmic granules and its activity therefore is a direct measure of neutrophil presence and an indirect indicator of lung injury. Total protein concentration and MPO in BALF were greatly depressed in group IV compared with group III, P<0.05, P<0.001. The upregulation of genes of CINC-1 and MCP-1 was closely related with lung inflammation caused by oxidative stress. MCP-1 and CINC-1 mRNA expression were detected and it was found that their changes were in line with the degree of lung inflammation. MCP-1 and CINC-1 mRNA expression increased in group III compared with group I especially on day 7, P<0.01 or <0.001. The changes of MCP-1 and CINC-1 mRNA were positively correlated with changes of MPO in BALF covering all groups on days 3, 7 and 14, respectively (r = 0.391, P<0.05; r = 0.701, P<0.01; r = 0.600, P<0.01; r = 0.471, P<0.01; r = 0.789, P<0.01; r = 0.588, P<0.01). EPO could significantly reduce the lung inflammatory cell infiltration, and capillary endothelial cell injury in hyperoxic lung injury in newborn rats. The mechanism may be related with the inhibition of MCP-1 and CINC-1 gene expression by EPO.

External validation of Cleveland Clinic Foundation colorectal cancer model in a University Clinic in terms of predicting operative mortality. The aim of this study was to perform an external validation of Cleveland Clinic Foundation colorectal cancer model in a single center. Relevant data of 771 patients who underwent surgery for colorectal cancer between January 1997 and November 2008 were retrospectively collected. The performance of the scoring system was evaluated by discrimination and calibration. Discrimination was evaluated by using the area under the receiver operator characteristics curve and calibration by using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test. Mean age was 60.8 (18-91). Forty-four percent of patients were female, and 56% were male. Overall mortality was 3.9%. Cleveland Clinic Foundation colorectal cancer model showed good discrimination but poor calibration. These data suggest that the Cleveland Clinic Foundation colorectal cancer model is a suitable model to be used in our center for patients with colorectal cancer but requires recalibration.

Chewing gum as a treatment for rumination in a child with autism. Rumination involves regurgitation of previously ingested food, rechewing the food, and reswallowing it. In the current study, a child with autism displayed chronic rumination, resulting in the decay and subsequent removal of several teeth. After several treatments failed, including thickened liquids and starch satiation, the participant was taught to chew gum. His rumination decreased significantly when gum was made available. Results suggest that access to chewing gum may be an effective treatment for rumination in some individuals.

Ileal iterative spontaneous perforation from foreign body granuloma: problems of histopathologic diagnosis. Spontaneous ileal perforation is a very rare cause of peritonitis. It occurs, in most of the cases, as a complication of Crohn's disease or intestinal tuberculosis. We present the case of a 23-year-old female patient with multiple surgical interventions during the last year, for iterative ileal spontaneous perforation with generalized peritonitis of which cause was initially assigned to intestinal tuberculosis. Actual episode of generalized peritonitis was determined once again by an ileal perforation of 5 mm at 70 cm from the ileo-cecal valve situated on a suture scar. Distally, a bowel stricture and a non-complicated Meckel's diverticulum were also noted. We performed an enterectomy including all three aforementioned lesions with end-to-end anastomosis. The histopathologic report revealed granulomatous giant-cellular inflammation in the margins of the perforation. The tuberculous etiology was questioned because of the negativity of the PCR-test and multiple recidives of perforation under specific anti-tuberculous medical therapy. The discovery of some rests of non-resorbable suturing material in a granuloma on an ancient enterorraphy scar in the resected specimen, finally established the cause. The granulomatous giant-cellular inflammation of foreign body is a rare cause of ileal perforation. The histopathologic differential diagnosis is difficult needing correlation with clinical data. Usage of resorbable suture material avoids that risk.

Comorbidity of intellectual disability confounds ascertainment of autism: implications for genetic diagnosis. While recent studies suggest a converging role for genetic factors towards risk for nosologically distinct disorders including autism, intellectual disability (ID), and epilepsy, current estimates of autism prevalence fail to take into account the impact of comorbidity of these disorders on autism diagnosis. We aimed to assess the effect of comorbidity on the diagnosis and prevalence of autism by analyzing 11 years (2000-2010) of special education enrollment data on approximately 6.2 million children per year. We found a 331% increase in the prevalence of autism from 2000 to 2010 within special education, potentially due to a diagnostic recategorization from frequently comorbid features such as ID. The decrease in ID prevalence equaled an average of 64.2% of the increase of autism prevalence for children aged 3-18 years. The proportion of ID cases potentially undergoing recategorization to autism was higher (P = 0.007) among older children (75%) than younger children (48%). Some US states showed significant negative correlations between the prevalence of autism compared to that of ID while others did not, suggesting state-specific health policy to be a major factor in categorizing autism. Further, a high frequency of autistic features was observed when individuals with classically defined genetic syndromes were evaluated for autism using standardized instruments. Our results suggest that current ascertainment practices are based on a single facet of autism-specific clinical features and do not consider associated comorbidities that may confound diagnosis. Longitudinal studies with detailed phenotyping and deep molecular genetic analyses are necessary to completely understand the cause of this complex disorder.

Potential role of IL-18 in the immunopathogenesis of AIDS, HIV-associated lipodystrophy and related clinical conditions. IL-18 is a pleiotropic and multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine that is often produced in response to a viral infection. The biological activities of the cytokine are tightly controlled by its natural antagonist, IL-18 binding protein (IL-18BP), as well as by activation of caspase-1, which cleaves the precursor form of IL-18 into its biologically mature form. The cytokine plays an important role in both innate and adaptive antiviral immune responses. Depending upon the context, it can promote TH1, TH2 and TH17 responses. Increased serum concentrations of IL-18 and concomitantly decreased concentrations of its natural antagonist have been described in HIV-infected persons as compared to HIV-seronegative healthy subjects. We discuss in this review article how increased biological activities of IL-18 contribute towards immunopathogenesis of AIDS, HIV-associated lipodystrophy syndrome and related metabolic disturbances. While the advent of potent anti-HIV drugs has significantly enhanced life span of HIV-infected patients, it has also increased the number of these patients suffering from metabolic disorders. The cytokine may prove to be a useful target for therapeutic intervention in these patients.

A case of perioperative glucose control by using an artificial pancreas in a patient with glycogen storage disease. A 57-year-old woman was diagnosed with type I glycogen storage disease in her twenties. She had undergone hepatectomy under general anesthesia with epidural anesthesia. Fifty minutes after the induction of anesthesia, a 20-gauge venous catheter was inserted in the patient's right hand, and an artificial pancreas (STG-55, Nikkiso Co., Tokyo, Japan) was connected for continuous glucose monitoring and automatic glucose control. Insulin was infused when the blood glucose level reached 120Â mg/dL or higher, and glucose was infused when the level fell to 100Â mg/dL or lower. After the Pringle maneuver, the blood glucose level increased, and insulin was administered automatically via an artificial pancreas. Hypoglycemia did not occur during the operation. After total parenteral nutrition was started in the intensive care unit (ICU), the blood glucose level increased, and the artificial pancreas controlled the blood glucose level through automatic insulin administration. Thirty-four hours after admission to the ICU, the artificial pancreas was removed because the blood sampling failed. After the removal of the artificial pancreas, blood glucose level was measured every 2Â h until extubation. During the ICU stay, hypoglycemia never occurred, with the average blood glucose level being 144Â mg/dL. In conclusion, the use of an artificial pancreas for perioperative blood glucose management in a patient with glycogen storage disease had the beneficial effect of enabling the management of blood glucose levels without hypoglycemia. 

The use of the Impella LP 2.5 percutaneous microaxial ventricular assist device as hemodynamic support during high-risk abdominal surgery. Physiologic changes associated with anesthesia and technical aspects of noncardiac surgical procedure expose patients with severely depressed myocardial function to an enormous risk of perioperative complications and morbidity. In cases when these patients require mechanical circulatory support while undergoing emergent or elective operations, perioparative monitoring becomes of paramount importance.

The formation of ordered nanoclusters controls cadherin anchoring to actin and cell-cell contact fluidity. Oligomerization of cadherins could provide the stability to ensure tissue cohesion. Cadherins mediate cell-cell adhesion by forming trans-interactions. They form cis-interactions whose role could be essential to stabilize intercellular junctions by shifting cadherin clusters from a fluid to an ordered phase. However, no evidence has been provided so far for cadherin oligomerization in cellulo and for its impact on cell-cell contact stability. Visualizing single cadherins within cell membrane at a nanometric resolution, we show that E-cadherins arrange in ordered clusters, providing the first demonstration of the existence of oligomeric cadherins at cell-cell contacts. Studying the consequences of the disruption of the cis-interface, we show that it is not essential for adherens junction formation. Its disruption, however, increased the mobility of junctional E-cadherin. This destabilization strongly affected E-cadherin anchoring to actin and cell-cell rearrangement during collective cell migration, indicating that the formation of oligomeric clusters controls the anchoring of cadherin to actin and cell-cell contact fluidity. 

Tissue characterization using multiscale products of wavelet transform of ultrasound radio frequency echoes. This paper presents a novel method for tissue characterization using wavelet transform of ultrasound radio frequency (RF) echo signals. We propose the use of multiscale products of wavelet transform sequences of RF echoes to estimate the scatterer distribution in the tissue. The proposed method is based on the fact that when emitted ultrasound beams interact with scatterers in the tissue, backscattered beams contain singularities corresponding to the location of the scatterers. The singularities will exist in multiple scales of wavelet sequences of the echo signals. Therefore, peaks of wavelet transform multiscale products correspond to the location of scatterers. Estimation of scatterer spacing can be used for tissue characterization. The efficacy of the proposed method was validated in RF echo signals of in-vitro human prostate to characterize normal and cancerous tissue. The results confirm that wavelet transform multiscale products of RF echo signals contain tissue typing information that can be used as an effective tool to differentiate normal and cancerous prostate tissue.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation of small animals: a modeling study of the influence of coil geometry, size and orientation. Several recent studies have investigated the mechanisms of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) using small animals. However, there is still limited knowledge about the distribution of the induced electric field, and its dependence on coil size, geometry and orientation. In this work we calculate the electric field induced in a realistically shaped homogeneous mouse model by commercially available coils in several different orientations. The results show that the secondary field, resulting from charge accumulation at the skin - air interface, drastically changes the magnitude, decay and focality of the primary field induced by the coil. Accurate knowledge about the distribution of the field is invaluable in designing experimental protocols and new coils for small animal stimulation.


Unanticipated C=C bonds in covalent monolayers on silicon revealed by NEXAFS.

Cyclostreptin and microtubules: is a low-affinity binding site required? Cyclostreptin (CS) is a recently discovered natural product with cytotoxic activity caused by microtubule stabilization. It is the only known microtubule-stabilizing agent (MSA) that covalently binds to tubulin. It also exhibits the fast-binding kinetics seen for other MSAs. Through careful peptide digestion and mass spectrometry analysis, Buey et al. found that two amino acids are labeled by CS: Asn228, near the known taxane-binding site, and Thr220, in the type I microtubule pore. This led Buey et al. to propose Thr220 resides at the site previously predicted to be a way station or low-affinity site. By using molecular dynamics simulations and structural considerations of the microtubule pore and tubulin dimer, we conclude that postulation of a low-affinity site is unnecessary to explain the available experimental data. An alternative explanation views the microtubule pore as a structural entity that presents a substantial kinetic barrier to ligand passage to the known taxane-binding site-an entry point to the microtubule lumen that becomes completely blocked if cyclostreptin is bound at Thr220. Simulations of the free dimer also suggest a common mechanism of microtubule stabilization for taxane site MSAs through their conformational effect on the M-loop. Such an effect explains the low tubulin polymerization caused by cyclostreptin in vitro despite its covalent attachment.

Assessing individual interethnic admixture and population substructure using a 48-insertion-deletion (INSEL) ancestry-informative marker (AIM) panel. Estimating the proportions of different ancestries in admixed populations is very important in population genetics studies, and it is particularly important for detecting population substructure effects in case-control association studies. In this work, a set of 48 ancestry-informative insertion-deletion polymorphisms (INDELs) were selected with the goal of efficiently measuring the proportions of three different ancestries (sub-Saharan African, European, and Native American) in mixed populations. All selected markers can be easily analyzed via multiplex PCR and detected with standard capillary electrophoresis. A total of 593 unrelated individuals representative of European, African, and Native American parental populations were typed, as were 380 individuals from three Brazilian populations with known admixture patterns. As expected, the interethnic admixture estimates show that individuals from southern Brazil present an almost exclusively European ancestry; Afro-descendant communities in the Amazon region, apart from the major African contribution, present some degree of admixture with Europeans and Native Americans; and a sample from BelÃ©m, in the northeastern Amazon, shows a significant contribution of the three ethnic groups, although with a greater European proportion. In summary, a panel of ancestry-informative INDELs was optimized and proven to be a valuable tool for estimating individual and global ancestry proportions in admixed populations. The ability to accurately infer interethnic admixtures highlights the usefulness of this marker set for assessing population substructure in association studies, particularly those conducted in Brazilian and other Latin American populations sharing trihybrid ancestry patterns.

[Transanal endoscopic microsurgery for the treatment of localized rectal neoplasms]. To investigate the therapeutic effect of transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) for localized rectal neoplasms. Seventy-five patients with localized rectal neoplasms were treated by using TEM between April 2006 and December 2008. The clinical data was summarized and analyzed retrospectively to report the therapeutic effect of TEM in these cases. The mean diameter of the rectal lesions was (1.6 +/- 0.8) cm (range, 0.5-5.0 cm). The average distance of lesions from the anal verge was (7.6 +/- 2.8) cm (range, 5-20 cm). Locations of the lesions at the rectal wall: 25 located at the anterior wall, 24 at the posterior wall, 14 at the left wall and 12 at the right wall. Surgical procedures included the transmural excision (64 cases) and the submucosal excision with partial muscular layer excision (11 cases) was performed. The average operating time was (73.7 +/- 32.1) min (range, 30-180 min). The mean operative blood loss was (9.8 +/- 7.7) ml (range, 3-50 ml). The postoperative pathological examination identified 28 cases of rectal adenoma, 25 rectal adenocarcinoma or carcinomatous changes of adenoma (14 cases with phase Tis tumor, 5 cases T1 and 6 cases T2), 7 rectal carcinoid and 15 cases of inflammatory polyps or others. Surgical margins of all specimens were negative. Postoperative complications occurred in 4 cases (5.3%), included 2 cases of anal hemorrhage, 1 case of pulmonary infection and 1 urinary infection. The average postoperative hospital stay was (3.4 +/- 1.2) d (range, 2-7 d). All the patients were followed-up for a mean period of 8. 4 months (range, 3-26 months), no tumor recurrence or metastasis was observed. Being a kind of minimally invasive surgery, TEM shows advantages of decreased blood loss, better therapeutic effect and faster recovery, and it is a better choice of procedure for local excision for rectal neoplasms.

Effects of Two Short-Term, Intermittent Hypoxic Training Protocols on the Finger Temperature Response to Local Cold Stress. The study examined the effects of two short-term, intermittent hypoxic training protocols, namely exercising in hypoxia and living in normoxia (LL-TH; n=8), and exercising in normoxia preceded by a series of brief intermittent hypoxic exposures at rest (IHE+NOR; n=8), on the finger temperature response during a sea-level local cold test. In addition, a normoxic group was assigned as a control group (NOR; n=8). All groups trained on a cycle-ergometer 1âh/day, 5 days/week for 4 weeks at 50% of peak power output. Pre, post, and 11 days after the last training session, subjects immersed their right hand for 30âmin in 8Â°C water. In the NOR group, the average finger temperature was higher in the post (+2.1Â°C) and 11-day after (+2.6Â°C) tests than in the pre-test (pâ¤0.001). Conversely, the fingers were significantly colder immediately after both hypoxic protocols (LL-TH: -1.1Â°C, IHE+NOR: -1.8Â°C; p=0.01). The temperature responses returned to the pre-training level 11 days after the hypoxic interventions. Ergo, present findings suggest that short-term intermittent hypoxic training impairs sea-level local cold tolerance; yet, the hypoxic-induced adverse responses seem to be reversible within a period of 11 days.

Modeling breast acini in tissue culture for detection of malignant phenotype reversion to non-malignant phenotype. Evidence is accumulating to support disruption of tissue architecture as a powerful event in tumor formation. For the past four decades, intensive cancer research with the premise of "cancer as a cell based-disease" focused on finding oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. However, the role of the tissue architecture was neglected. Three dimensional (3D) cell cultures which can recapitulate major aspects of the microenvironment are appropriate models for exploring cancer. For the first time in Iran, we have launched Matrigel based non-malignant, tumorigenic and reverted breast 3D cell cultures. Non-tumorigenic MCF-10A and tumorigenic MCF-7 breast cell lines were cultured on plastic and Matrigel. MCF-7 cell lines were reverted to normal phenotype via AIIB2 and LY 294002 inhibitors against beta1 integrin and class I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, respectively. MCF-10A acini were distinguishably different from MCF-7 on Matrigel. MCF-10A formed organized hollow spherical structures which were in stark contrast to the MCF-7 disorganized cluster of cells. Matrigel allowed visual monitoring of MCF-7 cells treated with inhibitors. After treatment of MCF-7 cells, we observed reversion of MCF-7 phenotype toward normal, comparable to MCF-10A acini. The 3D culture provides a microenvironment which allows malignant and non-malignant cells to demonstrate near physiological behavior and this can distinguish non-malignant from malignant cells. The 3D culture also allows visual monitoring of malignant phenotype reversion to organized spheres.


Denoising of multiscale/multiresolution structural feature dictionaries for rapid training of a brain computer interface.

A comparison between fractured Xience-like and Palmaz-like stents using a novel computational model. We developed a novel mathematical model to study the mechanical properties of endovascular stents in their expanded state. The model is based on the one-dimensional theory of slender curved rods. Stent struts are modeled as linearly elastic curved rods that satisfy the kinematic and dynamic contact conditions at the vertices where the struts meet. A Finite Element Method for a numerical computation of its solution was developed and used to study mechanical properties of two commonly used coronary stents (Palmaz-like and Xience-like stent) in their expanded, fractured state. A simple fracture (separation), corresponding to one stent strut being disconnected from one vertex in a stent, was considered. Our results show a drastic difference in the response of the two stents to the physiologically reasonable uniform compression and bending forces. In particular, deformation of a fractured Xience-like stent (with one strut separated from one vertex) is significantly larger than that of a fractured Palmaz-like stent when exposed to uniform compression and bending. This presents conditions which may be a precursor for the clinically observed complications associated with in-stent thrombosis and in-stent restenosis of fractured coronary stents.

Inoculation Preparation Affects Survival of Salmonella enterica on Whole Black Peppercorns and Cumin Seeds Stored at Low Water Activity. Salmonellosis has been increasingly associated with contaminated spices. Identifying inoculation and stabilization methods for Salmonella on whole spices is important for development of validated inactivation processes. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of inoculation preparation on the recoverability of Salmonella enterica from dried whole peppercorns and cumin seeds. Whole black peppercorns and cumin seeds were inoculated with S. enterica using one dry transfer method and various wet inoculation methods: immersion of spice seeds in tryptic soy broth (TSB) plus Salmonella for 24 h (likely leading to inclusion of Salmonella in native microbiota biofilms formed around the seeds), application of cells grown in TSB, and/or application of cells scraped from tryptic soy agar (TSA). Postinoculation seeds were dried to a water activity of 0.3 within 24 h and held for 28 days. Seeds were sampled after drying (time 0) and periodically during the 28 days of storage. Salmonella cells were enumerated by serial dilution and plated onto xylose lysine Tergitol (XLT4) agar and TSA. Recovery of Salmonella was high after 28 days of storage but was dependent on inoculation method, with 4.05 to 6.22 and 3.75 to 8.38 log CFU/g recovered from peppercorns and cumin seeds, respectively, on XLT4 agar. The changes in surviving Salmonella (log CFU per gram) from initial inoculation levels after 28 days were significantly smaller for the biofilm inclusion method (+0.142pepper, +0.186cumin) than for the other inoculation methods (-0.425pepper, -2.029cumin for cells grown on TSA; -0.641pepper, -0.718cumin for dry transfer; -1.998pepper for cells grown in TSB). In most cases, trends for reductions of total aerobic bacteria were similar to those of Salmonella. The inoculation method influenced the recoverability of Salmonella from whole peppercorns and cumin seeds after drying. The most stable inoculum strategies were dry transfer, 24-h incubation of Salmonella and spices in TSB (i.e., potential inclusion of Salmonella within native microbiota biofilms), and inoculation of Salmonella cells grown on TSA subsequent to drying. However, with the dry transfer method it was difficult to obtain the large amount of inoculum needed for inactivation studies.

Towards evidence-based emergency medicine: best BETs from the Manchester Royal Infirmary. BET: Is CT thorax necessary to exclude significant injury in paediatric patients with blunt chest trauma? A shortcut review was carried out to establish if CXR had sufficient sensitivity to rule out significant thoracic injury in haemodynamically stable, paediatric patients with a significant mechanism of trauma. No studies were found that directly answered the three-part question, but 13 studies were found which were considered relevant. The author, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes, results and study weaknesses of these papers are tabulated. The clinical bottom line is that important thoracic injuries may not be clinically apparent and that CT scans have a significantly higher sensitivity than CXR in detecting such injuries. 

Inheritance of a t(13;14)(q10;q10) Robertsonian translocation with a low level of trisomy 13 mosaicism. Low level of trisomy 13 mosaicism is a rare condition. In the present report, we describe a case of a 19-month-old boy with poor feeding, poor weight gain, mild dysmorphic features, mild muscular hypotonia, and speech delay. Cytogenetic analysis on metaphases of lymphocytes revealed an 8% mosaic Robertsonian translocation trisomy 13 in the boy and a balanced Robertsonian translocation, 45,XX,der(13;14)(q10;q10), in his normal mother. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) on patient lymphocytes disclosed 4% of metaphases with a trisomy 13. The trisomy 13 mosaicism in metaphases could not be identified by interphase FISH. The percentage of three signals (4%) was within the standard deviation in diploid controls. Follow-up of the patient was performed at the age of 7 1/12 years, and in cells from buccal smear of the patient, trisomy 13 was detected in 11% of interphases analyzed that is a higher frequency. Uniparental disomy of chromosomes 13 and 14 were excluded in the boy, and therefore, his phenotypic abnormalities most likely were caused by the low level of trisomy 13 mosaicism. The detailed report of this patient described the infrequent occurrence of a low mosaic Robertsonian translocation trisomy 13. We suggest to study cases of low trisomy mosaicism preferentially using metaphase analyses rather than interphase FISH. Our case is helpful in further defining the phenotype of these patients.

Cross-sectional survey of California childbirth hospitals: implications for defining maternal levels of risk-appropriate care. Measures of maternal mortality and severe maternal morbidity have risen in the United States, sparking national interest regarding hospitals' ability to provide maternal risk-appropriate care. We examined the extent to which hospitals could be classified by increasingly sophisticated maternal levels of care. We performed a cross-sectional survey to identify hospital-specific resources and classify hospitals by criteria for basic, intermediate, and regional maternal levels of care in all nonmilitary childbirth hospitals in California. We measured hospital compliance with maternal level of care criteria that were produced via consensus based on professional standards at 2 regional summits funded by the March of Dimes through a cooperative agreement with the Community Perinatal Network in 2007 (California Perinatal Summit on Risk-Appropriate Care). The response rate was 96% (239 of 248 hospitals). Only 82 hospitals (34%) were classifiable under these criteria (35 basic, 42 intermediate, and 5 regional) because most (157 [66%]) did not meet the required set of basic criteria. The unmet criteria preventing assignment into the basic category included the ability to perform a cesarean delivery within 30 minutes 100% of the time (only 64% met), pediatrician availability day and night (only 56% met), and radiology department ultrasound capability within 12 hours (only 83% met). Only 29 of classified hospitals (35%) had a nursery or neonatal intensive care unit level that matched the maternal level of care, and for most remaining hospitals (52 of 53), the neonatal intensive care unit level was higher than the maternal care level. Childbirth services varied widely across California hospitals, and most hospitals did not fit easily into proposed levels. Cognizance of this existing variation is critical to determining the optimal configuration of services for basic, intermediate, and regional maternal levels of care.

Long-term effects of childbirth in MS. The uncertainty about long-term effects of childbirth presents MS patients with dilemmas. Based on clinical data of 330 female MS patients, the long-term effects of childbirth were analysed, using a cross-sectional study design. Four groups of patients were distinguished: (1) without children (n = 80), (2) with children born before MS onset (n = 170), (3) with children born after MS onset (n = 61) and (4) with children born before and after MS onset (n = 19). A time-to-event analysis and Cox proportional hazard regression were performed with time from onset to EDSS 6 and age at EDSS 6 as outcome measure. After a mean disease duration of 18 years, 55% had reached EDSS 6. Survival curves show a distinct shift in the time to EDSS 6 between patients with no children after MS onset and patients with children after MS onset in favour of the latter. Cox regression analysis correcting for age at onset shows that patients with children only after MS onset had a reduced risk compared with patients without children (HR 0.61; 95% CI 0.37 to 0.99, p = 0.049). Also, patients who gave birth at any point in time had a reduced risk compared with patients without children (HR 0.66; 95% CI 0.47 to 0.95, p = 0.023). A similar pattern was seen for age at EDSS 6 (HR 0.57, p = 0.027 and HR 0.68, p = 0.032 respectively) Although a bias cannot fully be excluded, these results seem to support a possible favourable long-term effect of childbirth on the course of MS.

Effect of epinastine hydrochloride on murine self-scratching behavior after skin-scratching stimulation. The itch-scratch cycle aggravates chronic inflammatory skin diseases. We have previously reported that mice begin to scratch themselves within several minutes after skin-scratching stimulation. This is associated with an increase in release of substance P (SP) from sensory nerve fibers in the skin, and the self-scratching behavior is suppressed by neurokinin-1 receptor (NK-1R) antagonist. Thus, SP may play a pivotal role in self-scratching behavior. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of second-generation histamine H(1)-receptor antagonists on self-scratching behavior in mice. After oral administration of epinastine hydrochloride (epinastine) (total dose 50 +/- 5 mg/kg for 7 days) or the vehicle only to ICR mice for 7 days, skin-scratching stimulation was administered to the dorsal skin for 10 min. Self-scratching behavior was recorded by video camera for 10 min. Twenty-four hours later, skin tissue was harvested and stained with toluidine blue. Immunohistochemical staining for SP was performed, and SP and nerve growth factor (NGF) concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Self-scratching behavior, mast cell degranulation, and NGF concentration decreased, and the length of SP-positive nerve fibers and SP concentrations increased significantly in the epinastine-treated group, when compared with the vehicle control group. We conclude that epinastine inhibits mast cell degranulation by attenuating SP release from sensory nerve fibers, which results in inhibition of self-scratching behavior.

Breast cancer in Latin America: experts perceptions compared with medical care standards. The BCRF II study presents a systematic review of the norms, recommendations and guidelines that are considered medical care standards (MCS) for breast cancer in 12 Latin American and Caribbean countries. Three key questions from the BCRF I survey data on early detection and diagnosis are presented to identify implementation practice patterns related to MCS. Information related to MCS was requested from governmental health authorities, cancer institutes, and national scientific and professional societies in 12 Latin American and Caribbean countries. Documents received were reviewed by breast cancer experts from each respective country. Three key survey questions from the BCRF I survey on early detection and diagnosis were reprocessed to provide information related to implementation practice of existing MCS. All countries included in the BCRF II study had medical care standards (MCS) whether published by governmental authorities, national professional or scientific associations, cancer institutes, or adoption of international MCS. Experts reported different practice patterns at a Country level versus a Center level. Overall, 85% of the experts reported that less than 50% of the women with no symptoms undergo a mammography at the Country level compared to 43% at the Center level. For diagnostic suspicion of breast cancer, 80% of experts considered the diagnostic suspicion at a Country level to come from the patient compared to 50% at a Center level. About 30% of patients waited for more than 3 months for a diagnosis at the Country level compared to 7% at the Center level. All the Latin America and Caribbean countries in the study reported the use of similar MCS for breast cancer care. The reported difference between care practiced at a Country level versus a Center level suggests the challenge is not in generating new MCS, but in implementing policies and control mechanisms for compliance with existing MCS, guaranteeing their applicability to all populations.

Mental and physical quality of life in actual living liver donors versus potential living liver donors: a prospective, controlled, multicenter study. In a quasi-experimental design, we investigated the quality of life (QOL) in actual liver donors (n = 43) and potential liver donors (n = 33) before and 3 months after liver transplantation. This is the first study in this field combining a prospective design with an adequate control group. Potential donors served as a control group because they also had a relative in need of a liver transplant and were as emotionally involved with the recipient as actual donors, but they were not subjected to the donor operation. Groups did not differ in age, gender, marital status, donor-recipient relationship, urgency of transplantation, or recipient group (adult versus child). Actual donors showed decreased physical QOL, whereas potential donors were not affected. However, for both groups, a decrease in anxiety was found. Furthermore, actual donors showed a better mental QOL postoperatively than potential donors. The recipients of these 2 groups did not differ with respect to postoperative complications. Furthermore, the groups did not report a different caregiver burden, but actual donors showed higher self-esteem. Because of the surgery, the worsening of physical symptoms in actual donors was expected. It is remarkable, however, that although actual donors still showed a limited physical QOL 3 months after the operation, in both groups, a similar reduction in anxiety could be observed, and actual donors even demonstrated a better mental QOL postoperatively than potential donors. The latter might be due to a psychological benefit that actual donors derived from the fact that they were able to help the recipients.

Prognostic factors for stage I ovarian carcinoma. Stage I ovarian carcinoma is relatively uncommon, and data on prognostic factors are conflicting. The clinical and pathologic features of 51 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I ovarian carcinomas were analyzed. There were 22 stage IA, 1 stage IB, and 28 stage IC cases. The mean follow-up was 6.1 years. The 5-year and 10-year disease-specific survival rates for the entire cohort were 92% and 78%, respectively. Among 51 patients, there were 6 tumor deaths, and 1 patient died of unrelated causes. All patients who died of disease were stage IC. Significant adverse prognostic factors were serous histology [relative risk (RR) 5.4, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.3-22.0] and stage IC (RR 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-1.5). Among factors associated with stage IC, only positive washings or ascites affected survival (RR 9.25, 95% CI 1.9-44.4). The 5-year survival rates for stages IA and IC were 100% and 83%, respectively (P<0.025, log rank test). For comprehensively staged patients, the 5-year survival rate was 96% as compared with 72% for all others (P<0.025, log rank test). Tumor rupture, surface involvement, histologic grade and clear cell histology were not of adverse prognostic significance. Serous histology and positive washings or ascites are adverse prognostic factors in stage I. The prognostic importance of tumor grade, rupture, surface involvement and clear cell histology remains unclear. Patients who are International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I on the basis of comprehensive surgical staging have an excellent prognosis.

[Psychosocial characteristics of an initial sample of Puerto Rican centenarians]. This is the first research done in Puerto Rico presenting a basic socio-demographic profile of a sample of Puerto Rican centenary elderly that also includes psychological characteristics. The sample consist of eleven subjects, divided in five women and six men (mean age sample = 102.4 years) evaluated with a battery of psychological instrument that include the Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R); the Beck Depressive Inventory (BDI-II); the Beck Suicide Scale (BSS); the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS); the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) and the Folstein Mini-Mental. Main findings demonstrate that, with the exception of anxiety and hopelessness symptomatology, this particular sample is with a good psychological health. It is recommended to continue this type of research with a bigger sample and include other psychological and psychiatric screening instruments.

MiR-125b is critical for the suppression of human U251 glioma stem cell proliferation. Stem cells are unique in their ability to self-renew and maintain tissue homoeostasis by differentiating into different cell types to replace aged or damaged cells. The key characteristic of the stem cell is its capacity to divide for long periods of time. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNA molecules that regulate protein expression by cleaving or repressing the translation of target mRNAs. miR-125b, one of neuronal miRNAs, recently was found to be necessary for stem cell fission to bypass the normal G1/S checkpoint and make stem cells insensitive to chemotherapy signals, which normally stop the cell cycle at the G1/S transition. Given the insensitivity of gliomas to chemotherapy and the hypothesis that glioma stem cells cause resistance to drug therapy, exploring the functions and mechanisms of miR-125b in glioma stem cells would be valuable. In this study, we found that miR-125b was downregulated in human U251 glioma stem cells, therefore suggesting that its upregulation can lead to the growth inhibition of U251 glioma stem cells in vitro. Further research on the mechanism demonstrated that inhibition of miR-125b-induced U251 glioma stem cell proliferation was due to cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition and involved the cell cycle regulated proteins CDK6 and CDC25A; miR-125b overexpression decreased CDK6 and CDC25A expression. These findings underscore the potential of miR-125b to regulate the proliferation of U251 glioma stem cells through the cell cycle regulated proteins CDK6 and CDC25A.


Recurrent ischemic stroke in a patient with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura.

Participation of ATP7A in macrophage mediated oxidation of LDL. ATP7A primarily functions to egress copper from cells, thereby supplying this cofactor to secreted copper-accepting enzymes. This ATPase has attracted significant attention since the discovery of its mutation leading to human Menkes disease and the demonstration of its distribution in various tissues. Recently, we reported that ATP7A is expressed in the human vasculature. In the present study, we investigated the cellular expression of ATP7A in atherosclerotic lesions of LDL receptor (-/-) mice. Subsequently, we examined the role of ATP7A in regulating the oxidation of LDL in a macrophage cell model. We observed that ATP7A is expressed in atherosclerotic murine aorta and colocalizes with macrophages. To investigate the function of ATP7A, we downregulated ATP7A expression in THP-1 derived macrophages using small interfering RNA (siRNA). ATP7A downregulation attenuated cell-mediated oxidation of LDL. Moreover, downregulation of ATP7A resulted in decreased expression and enzymatic activity of cytosolic phospholipase A(2) alpha (cPLA(2)alpha), a key intracellular enzyme involved in cell-mediated LDL oxidation. In addition, cPLA(2)alpha promoter activity was decreased after downregulation of ATP7A, suggesting that ATP7A transcriptionally regulates cPLA(2)alpha expression. Finally, cPLA(2)alpha overexpression increased LDL oxidation, which was blocked by coadministration of ATP7A siRNA oligonucleotides. These findings suggest a novel mechanism linking ATP7A to cPLA(2)alpha and LDL oxidation, suggesting that this copper transporter could play a previously unrecognized role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

Retinoic acid signaling positively regulates liver specification by inducing wnt2bb gene expression in medaka. During vertebrate embryogenesis, the liver develops at a precise location along the endodermal primitive gut tube because of signaling delivered by adjacent mesodermal tissues. Although several signaling molecules have been associated with liver formation, the molecular mechanism that regulates liver specification is still unclear. We previously performed a screen in medaka to isolate mutants with impaired liver development. The medaka hio mutants exhibit a profound (but transient) defect in liver specification that resembles the liver formation defect found in zebrafish prometheus (prt) mutants, whose mutation occurs in the wnt2bb gene. In addition to their liver abnormality, hio mutants lack pectoral fins and die after hatching. Positional cloning indicated that the hio mutation affects the raldh2 gene encoding retinaldehyde dehydrogenase type2 (RALDH2), the enzyme principally responsible for retinoic acid (RA) biosynthesis. Mutations of raldh2 in zebrafish preclude the development of pectoral fins. Interestingly, in hio mutants, expression of wnt2bb in the lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) directly adjacent to the liver-forming endoderm was completely lost. Our data reveal the unexpected finding that RA signaling positively regulates the wnt2bb gene expression required for liver specification in medaka. These results suggest that a common molecular mechanism may underlie liver and pectoral fin specification during piscine embryogenesis.

The impact of new research technologies on our understanding of environmental causes of disease: the concept of clinical vulnerability. In spite of decades of epidemiological research, the etiology and causal patterns for many common diseases, such as breast and colon cancer or neurodegenerative diseases, are still largely unknown. Such chronic diseases are likely to have an environmental origin. However, "environmental" risks have been often elusive in epidemiological studies. This is a conundrum for current epidemiological research. On the other side, the relative contribution of genes to chronic diseases, as emerging from GWAS, seems to be modest (15-50% increase in disease risk). What is yet to be explored extensively is a model of disease based on long-term effects of low doses of environmental exposures, incorporating both genetic and acquired susceptibility ("clinical vulnerability"), and the cumulative effects of different exposures. Such a disease model would be compatible with the weak associations found by GWAS and the still elusive role of many (low-level) environmental exposures. We also propose that the introduction of "-omic" high-throughput technologies, such as transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics, may provide, in the next years, powerful tools to investigate early effects of environmental exposures and understand the etiology of common diseases better, according to the "clinical vulnerability model". The development of "-omics", in spite of current limitations and lack of sound validation, could greatly contribute to the elucidation of the disease model we propose.

Monitoring cardiac output and left atrial pressure by analysis of the right ventricular pressure waveform based on missing output identification. A proven implantable device is now available for long-term ambulatory monitoring of the right ventricular pressure (RVP) waveform of congestive heart failure patients. However, cardiac output (CO) and left atrial pressure (LAP) are far more useful for assessing cardiac function and managing volume status. We developed a new technique to monitor both CO and LAP by analysis of the RVP waveform based on missing output identification. We initially evaluated the technique against gold standard reference CO and LAP measurements from two dogs during common hemodynamic interventions. We report overall CO and LAP errors of 13.3% and 1.9 mmHg, respectively. With further successful testing, the technique may potentially be employed with an established implantable device for chronic monitoring of vital hemodynamic variables.

Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy in the term infant.

An Actor-Critic architecture and simulator for goal-directed Brain-Machine Interfaces. The Perception-Action Cycle (PAC) is a central component of goal-directed behavior because it links internal percepts with external outcomes in the environment. Using inspiration from the PAC, we are developing a Brain-Machine Interface control architecture that utilizes both motor commands and goal information directly from the brain to navigate to novel targets in an environment. An Actor-Critic algorithm was selected for decoding the neural motor commands because it is a PAC-based computational framework where the perception component is implemented in the critic structure and the actor is responsible for taking actions. We develop in this work a biologically realistic simulator to analyze the performance of the decoder in terms of convergence and target acquisition. Experience from the simulator will guide parameter selection and assist in understanding the architecture before animal experiments. By varying the signal to noise ratio of the neural input and error signal, we were able to demonstrate how the learning rate and initial conditions affect a motor control target selection task. In this framework, the naÃ¯ve decoder was able to reach targets in the presence of noise in the error signal and neural motor command with 98% accuracy.

PNA-mediated modulation and redirection of Her-2 pre-mRNA splicing: specific skipping of erbB-2 exon 19 coding for the ATP catalytic domain. The Her-2 receptor coded for by the proto-oncogenic erbB-2 gene is a clinically validated target for treatment of a significant genetic subclass of breast cancers, and Her-2 is also overexpressed or mutated in a range of other cancers. In an approach to exploit antisense mediated splicing interference as a means of manipulating erbB-2 expression in a therapeutically relevant fashion, we have studied the effect on mRNA splicing of a series of peptide nucleic acid (PNA) oligomers targeting specific intron-exon junctions in the erbB-2 pre-mRNA. In particular, we are interested in identifying PNA oligomers that specifically induce skipping of exon 19 as this exon is coding for the ATP catalytic domain of Her-2, and if expressed such truncated version of the Her-2 protein should be functionally inactive in a dominant negative fashion. Therefore, antisense compounds having efficient erbB-2 exon 19 skipping activity could be very interesting in terms of drug discovery. In the present study we identified PNA oligomers having such activity in SK-BR-3 and HeLa cancer cells in culture.

Structural Bioinformatics Inspection of neXtProt PE5 Proteins in the Human Proteome. One goal of the Human Proteome Project is to identify at least one protein product for each of the â¼20,000 human protein-coding genes. As of October 2014, however, there are 3564 genes (18%) that have no or insufficient evidence of protein existence (PE), as curated by neXtProt; these comprise 2647 PE2-4 missing proteins and 616 PE5 dubious protein entries. We conducted a systematic examination of the 616 PE5 protein entries using cutting-edge protein structure and function modeling methods. Compared to a random sample of high-confidence PE1 proteins, the putative PE5 proteins were found to be over-represented in the membrane and cell surface proteins and peptides fold families. Detailed functional analyses show that most PE5 proteins, if expressed, would belong to transporters and receptors localized in the plasma membrane compartment. The results suggest that experimental difficulty in identifying membrane-bound proteins and peptides could have precluded their detection in mass spectrometry and that special enrichment techniques with improved sensitivity for membrane proteins could be important for the characterization of the PE5 "dark matter" of the human proteome. Finally, we identify 66 high scoring PE5 protein entries and find that six of them were reported in recent mass spectrometry databases; an illustrative annotation of these six is provided. This work illustrates a new approach to examine the potential folding and function of the dubious proteins comprising PE5, which we will next apply to the far larger group of missing proteins comprising PE2-4.

Implications of urbanization for artisanal parrotfish fisheries in the Western Solomon Islands. Increasing migration into urbanized centers in the Solomon Islands poses a great threat to adjacent coral reef fisheries because of negative effects on the fisheries and because it further erodes customary management systems. Parrotfish fisheries are of particular importance because the feeding habits of parrotfish (scrape and excavate coral) are thought to be critical to the resilience of coral reefs and to maintaining coral reef health within marine protected areas. We investigated the ecological impact of localized subsistence and artisanal fishing pressure on parrotfish fisheries in Gizo Town, Western Solomon Islands, by analyzing the density and size distribution of parrotfish with an underwater visual census (UVC), recall diary (i.e., interviews with fishers), and creel surveys to independently assess changes in abundance and catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) over 2 years. We then compared parrotfish data from Gizo Town with equivalent data from sites open to and closed to fishing in Kida and Nusa Hope villages, which have different customary management regimes. Results indicated a gradient of customary management effectiveness. Parrotfish abundance was greater in customary management areas closed to fishing, especially with regard to larger fish sizes, than in areas open to fishing. The decline in parrotfish abundance from 2004 to 2005 in Gizo was roughly the same magnitude as the difference in abundance decline between inside and outside customary management marine reserves. Our results highlight how weak forms of customary management can result in the rapid decline of vulnerable fisheries around urbanized regions, and we present examples in which working customary management systems (Kinda and Nusa Hope) can positively affect the conservation of parrotfish--and reef fisheries in general--in the highly biodiverse Coral Triangle region.

Hydrocephalus in dogs and cats. Hydrocephalus is distension of the ventricular system of the brain related to inadequate passage of cerebrospinal fluid from its point of production within the ventricular system to its point of absorption into the systemic circulation. Developmental disorders are the most common causes of hydrocephalus, but there are other causes as well. Diagnosis is based on the clinical features and on brain imaging to assess ventricular size and to identify any specific causes. Medical therapy can provide temporary relief but definitive treatment usually involves placement of a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. This article discusses the pathophysiology and management of hydrocephalus.

Uveal melanoma: management and outcome of patients with extraocular spread. BACKGROUND Extraocular spread is thought to be a negative prognostic factor on the survival in patients with uveal melanoma. Enucleation was the standard treatment in these patients. Today, depending on the size of the tumour and the type of extraocular extension, eye-preserving irradiation treatments, such as proton beams or radioactive plaques, may be employed. METHODS 2256 patients were treated between 2000 and 2007 at the Institut Curie, Paris, France for a uveal melanoma. 67 patients (3.0%) presented an extraocular extension. A retrospective study was performed to evaluate the patients' outcomes with regard to tumour recurrence and survival. RESULTS Eye-conserving treatment was employed in 38 (52.8%) patients. Enucleation was performed in 29 (47.2%) patients. The median follow-up was 38 (range 7 to 79) months with an overall survival rate at 5 years of 40.4% in enucleated patients and 79.3% in the eye-conserving treatment group (protons n=19, iodine-125 plaque n=19) (p=0.01; Kaplan-Meier analysis). No tumour recurrence was observed in any group. The degree of extraocular spread as well as the clinical characteristics tumour location, retinal detachment, ciliary body involvement (p<0.01; chi(2) test) and tumour thickness (p=0.04; chi(2) test) influenced the choice of treatment. Age, tumour diameter, involvement of optic nerve, vitreous haemorrhage and the amount of pigment did not have any influence. CONCLUSIONS Tumour recurrence rates and survival rates were not adversely affected in patients receiving conservative eye treatment. This may thus represent a therapeutic option in certain patients with extraocular spread.

Thermoresponsive hydrogel with embedded magnetic nanoparticles for the implementation of shrinkable medical microrobots and for targeting and drug delivery applications. The paper describes the choice of a thermoresponsive material for the implementation of untethered medical microrobots and other microdevices. These entities can be propelled at a specific location in the body using a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) system while being actuated for various functions such as the release of drugs by a volume change induced by hyperthermia of nanoparticles embedded in the hydrogel. This paper presents some preliminary results showing that poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPA) might be an interesting choice, because of the important volume decrease when temperature is increased of some degrees. Using PNIPA based microparticles could be an interesting choice because, according to our results, volume changes are more important when the volume is smaller, and shrinking rate is higher when there are nanoparticles embedded in the hydrogel.

[Neuropsychological examinations in frontotemporal lobar degeneration]. Many studies have attempted to identify neuropsychological tests that could distinguish frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) from other types of dementia. Although some measures of frontal lobe function, memory, language, visuospatial function and, general cognitive ability revealed significant differences between FTLD and other types of dementia, there was a large overlap in the test performance among these groups. Therefore, neuropsychological tests should be used in conjunction with clinical and radiological findings to identify FTLD patients. However, suitably selected neuropsychological tests can be useful to monitor the temporal changes in cognitive function in each FTLD patient and to compare the clinical features of this disorder with other types of dementia.

Effect of alginate on satiation, appetite, gastric function, and selected gut satiety hormones in overweight and obesity. Lack of control of food intake, excess size, and frequency of meals are critical to the development of obesity. The stomach signals satiation postprandially and may play an important role in control of calorie intake. Sodium alginate (based on brown seaweed Laminaria digitata) is currently marketed as a weight loss supplement, but its effects on gastric motor functions and satiation are unknown. We evaluated effects of 10 days treatment with alginate or placebo on gastric functions, satiation, appetite, and gut hormones associated with satiety in overweight or obese adults. We conducted a randomized, 1:1, placebo-controlled, allocation-concealed study in 48 overweight or obese participants with excluded psychiatric comorbidity and binge eating disorder. All underwent measurements of gastric emptying (GE), fasting, and postprandial gastric volumes (GVs), postprandial satiation, calorie intake at a free choice meal and selected gut hormones after 1 week of alginate (three capsules vs. matching placebo per day, ingested 30 min before the main meal). Six capsules were ingested with water 30 min before the GE, GV, and satiation tests on days 8-10. There were no treatment group effects on GE or volumes, gut hormones (ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY)), satiation, total and macronutrient calorie intake at a free choice meal. There was no difference detected in results between obese and overweight patients. Alginate treatment for a period of 10 days showed no effect on gastric motor functions, satiation, appetite, or gut hormones. These results question the use of short-term alginate treatment for weight loss.

Demystifying phenotypes: The comparative genomics of evo-devo. Developmental geneticists have spearheaded the synthesis of evolutionary and developmental biology, a.k.a 'evo-devo', leading to a wealth of recent insights about how morphological diversity has evolved. However, there exists a gap between these disciplines, and evo-devo has not benefited from an integration of the principles derived from population genetics and molecular evolution. In order to contribute to the remediation of this deficiency, we recently performed a study investigating how genes diverge among closely related species of Drosophila as a function of when they are expressed during development. We found that patterns of genetic divergence parallels morphology: interspecific divergence accumulates as development progresses. We also sought to test whether this positive gradient of divergence over ontogeny is best explained by purifying selection constraining the divergence of early-expressed genes or positive selection driving the evolution of those expressed later. Interestingly, we found evidence that both processes occur simultaneously. We argue that comparative genomics approaches, by juxtaposing gene- and phenotypelevel divergence, particularly among closely related species, have much to contribute to the ongoing evo-devo synthesis, complementing traditional genetics-based techniques with largescale screening analyses uncovering the mechanisms underlying developmental change.

Performance measurement and improvement frameworks in health, education and social services systems: a systematic review. To perform a systematic review, supplemented by a targeted grey literature scan, for performance measurement and improvement frameworks within and across the health, education and social service systems. The intended outcome was the creation of a foundation of evidence to inform the development of cross-sectoral quality improvement frameworks. MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, EMBASE, Social Services Abstracts, Social Work Abstracts and Education Index Full Text were searched up to April/May 2007. In addition, 26 governmental and 27 organizational websites were searched. English language material with a publication date of 1986 or more recent that described a health, education or social services multidimensional framework for performance measurement and improvement. Data extraction The framework name; administrative sector; level of application; setting; population of interest; categories of quality described within the framework; country of application; and citations to other performance measurement and improvement frameworks were extracted from each article. In total, 111 frameworks were identified. Most frameworks (n = 97) were developed in or for the health sector. A concept sorting exercise identified 16 quality concepts applicable across many settings, sectors and levels of application. This systematic review of quality domains will be relevant and useful to those who are developing and using performance measurement and improvement frameworks for adult and child populations within or across the health, social service or education sectors.


[Clinical results and peri-operative complications of total knee arthroplasty for patients with different ages].

Prevalence and prediction of primary sleep disorders in a clinical trial of depressed patients with insomnia. Insomnia-pharmacology clinical trials routinely exclude primary sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), with a single night of polysomnography (PSG). Given the expense of PSG, we examined whether a thorough clinical screening, combined with actigraphy, would successfully identify OSA and PLMD as part of baseline screening for a clinical trial of insomnia treatment in depressed patients. Of the 73 patients with a complete baseline dataset, 12 screened positive for OSA/PLMD (AHI > 15, or PLMAI > 15), while 61 "passed" the PSG screen. The OSA/PLMD+ patients were older (51.4 +/- 10.2 y) and took more naps (2.6 per week) than the OSA/PLMD- patients (41.3 +/- 12.8 y; and 1.1 naps per week). The combination of age and nap frequency produced a "good" receiver operating characteristic (ROC) model for predicting OSA/PLMD+, with the area under the curve of 0.82. There were no other demographic, sleep diary, or actigraphic variables, which differed between OSA/PLM + or -, and no other variable improved the ROC model. Still, the best model misclassified 16 of 73 persons. We conclude that while age and the presence of napping were helpful in identifying OSA and PLM in a well-screened sample of depressed insomniacs, PSG is required to definitively identify and exclude primary sleep disorders in insomnia clinical trials.

Evaluation of IOM personal sampler at different flow rates. The Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) personal sampler is usually operated at a flow rate of 2.0 L/min, the rate at which it was designed and calibrated, for sampling the inhalable mass fraction of airborne particles in occupational environments. In an environment of low aerosol concentrations only small amounts of material are collected, and that may not be sufficient for analysis. Recently, a new sampling pump with a flow rate up to 15 L/min became available for personal samplers, with the potential of operating at higher flow rates. The flow rate of a Leland Legacy sampling pump, which operates at high flow rates, was evaluated and calibrated, and its maximum flow was found to be 10.6 L/min. IOM samplers were placed on a mannequin, and sampling was conducted in a large aerosol wind tunnel at wind speeds of 0.56 and 2.22 m/s. Monodisperse aerosols of oleic acid tagged with sodium fluorescein in the size range of 2 to 100 microm were used in the test. The IOM samplers were operated at flow rates of 2.0 and 10.6 L/min. Results showed that the IOM samplers mounted in the front of the mannequin had a higher sampling efficiency than those mounted at the side and back, regardless of the wind speed and flow rate. For the wind speed of 0.56 m/s, the direction-averaged (the average value of all orientations facing the wind direction) sampling efficiency of the samplers operated at 2.0 L/min was slightly higher than that of 10.6 L/min. For the wind speed of 2.22 m/s, the sampling efficiencies at both flow rates were similar for particles < 60 microm. The results also show that the IOM's sampling efficiency at these two different flow rates follows the inhalable mass curve for particles in the size range of 2 to 20 microm. The test results indicate that the IOM sampler can be used at higher flow rates.

Handling changes in MRI acquisition parameters in modeling whole brain lesion volume and atrophy data in multiple sclerosis subjects: Comparison of linear mixed-effect models. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain provides important outcome measures in the longitudinal evaluation of disease activity and progression in MS subjects. Two common measures derived from brain MRI scans are the brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) and T2 hyperintense lesion volume (T2LV), and these measures are routinely assessed longitudinally in clinical trials and observational studies. When measuring each outcome longitudinally, observed changes may be potentially confounded by variability in MRI acquisition parameters between scans. In order to accurately model longitudinal change, the acquisition parameters should thus be considered in statistical models. In this paper, several models for including protocol as well as individual MRI acquisition parameters in linear mixed models were compared using a large dataset of 3453 longitudinal MRI scans from 1341 subjects enrolled in the CLIMB study, and model fit indices were compared across the models. The model that best explained the variance in BPF data was a random intercept and random slope with protocol specific residual variance along with the following fixed-effects: baseline age, baseline disease duration, protocol and study time. The model that best explained the variance in T2LV was a random intercept and random slope along with the following fixed-effects: baseline age, baseline disease duration, protocol and study time. In light of these findings, future studies pertaining to BPF and T2LV outcomes should carefully account for the protocol factors within longitudinal models to ensure that the disease trajectory of MS subjects can be assessed more accurately.

[The effects of amylin on the islet beta-cells voltage-gated L-calcium channels in rats]. To observe the effect of amylin on the islet beta-cells voltage-gated L-calcium channels in rats. Patch clamp technique was employed in the observation of the features and changes of electric current of islet beta-cells voltage-gated L-calcium channels before and after using amylin. In the glucose environment of 5.5 mmol/L, the electric current of rat islet beta-cells voltage-gated L-calcium channels was activated at -40 mV and reached the peak at about +20 mV, with a peak value of about -120 pA and the insulin secretion level was (0.76 +/- 0.12) microg/L. Under the stimulation of glucose of 16.7 mmol/L, the peak current voltage moved to the left and increased up to - 140 pA and the level of insulin secretion measured (1.78 +/- 0.13) microg/L. Hatch islet beta-cells in amylin at the concentrations of 0.5, 1.0, 5.0 and 10.0 micromol/L, respectively. It was observed that in the 0.5 micromol/L and 1.0 micromol/L groups, there was no remarkable change in the peak potential activation voltage, current, and insulin secretion volume in comparison with the control group. However, in the environment of 5.5 mmol/L glucose, the increase of activation voltage of the 5.0 and 10.0 micromol/L groups was - 30 mV, with the peak current reduced to approximately -80 pA and -60 pA and the insulin secretion decreased to (0.49 +/- 0.11) microg/L and (0.36 +/- 0.12) microg/L respectively. Under the concentration of 16.7 mmol/L glucose, the activation voltage increased from -40 mV up to -30 mV and the peak current reduced to -80 pA and -40 pA. In the meantime, the insulin secretion decreased respectively to (1.20 +/- 0.13) microg/L and (0.89 +/- 0.14) microg/L, which is of significance. The secretion of insulin is synchronized with the opening of the islet beta-cells voltage-gated L-calcium channels at the stimulation of glucose. The amylin inhibition of the insulin secretion is also synchronized with the opening of islet beta-cells voltage-gated L-calcium channels and it's in a positive concentration-dependent manner.

Improvement in phonation after reconstruction of the recurrent laryngeal nerve in patients with thyroid cancer invading the nerve. We report vocal improvement after reconstruction of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) in patients with nerve resection, although vocal cord movement was not restored. These methods are not widely recognized. Direct anastomosis, free nerve grafting, or anastomosis to the ansa cervicalis or the vagus nerves with the RLN were performed in 7, 14, 65, and 2 patients with thyroid cancer invading the RLN, respectively. A total of 51 patients had vocal cord paralysis (VCP) pre-operatively. Maximum phonation time (MPT) and vital capacity (VC) were measured before and 1 year after reconstruction. A total of 34 normal subjects and 27 patients with VCP served as controls. Patients with VCP had significantly shorter MPT values than normal subjects. At 1 year after operation, patients with reconstruction had values of MPT similar to those of normal subjects. Men had significantly longer MPT values than women, but the phonation efficiency index (PEI), defined as the MPT/VC ratio, did not differ by sex. The PEI was significantly less in VCP patients than in normal subjects. Patients with reconstruction achieved PEI values similar to those in normal subjects. Phonation efficiency index values at 1 year after operation was significantly greater than pre-operative PEI and was not affected by the presence or absence of VCP pre-operatively, age, reconstruction method, thickness of suture thread, or use of magnification during the operation. In patients with thyroid cancer requiring RLN resection, RLN reconstruction achieved recovery in phonatory function.

[Morbidity of stomach cancer and its relapse in patients of different age]. Timely diagnostics and treatment of the stomach cancer and its relapse in patients of different age is one of the complex problems in geriatrics, surgery and oncology. The peculiarities of clinic course of stomach cancer and its relapse were analyzed in 600 histories. The study revealed the dependence on age of development of stomach cancer and its possible relapse; period of preoperative preparation and effectiveness of the treatment in dependence on the age of the patient. The results demonstrate that elderly and senile patients are of high risk to get the stomach cancer and its relapse; they also often have many complications of the disease. The disease is diagnosed at generalized stage in 70% of the cases; at the same time 52% of patients, especially elderly and senior ones, come to the hospital as first aid patients, which confirms the necessity to improve the methods of early diagnostic of the disease.

Expression of the dermatomyositis autoantigen Mi-2 in regenerating muscle. Autoantibodies against the chromatin remodeler Mi-2 are found in a distinct subset of patients with dermatomyositis (DM). Previous quantitative immunoblotting experiments demonstrated that Mi-2 protein levels are up-regulated in DM muscle. This study was undertaken to define the population of cells expressing high levels of Mi-2 in DM muscle and to explore the regulation and functional role of Mi-2 during muscle regeneration. The expression of Mi-2 was analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy in human muscle biopsy specimens. In an experimental mouse model, cardiotoxin was used to induce muscle injury and repair, and expression of Mi-2 during muscle regeneration was studied in this model by immunofluorescence and immunoblotting analyses. In addition, a cell culture system of muscle differentiation was utilized to artificially modulate Mi-2 levels during proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts. In human DM muscle tissue, increased Mi-2 expression was found preferentially in the myofibers within fascicles affected by perifascicular atrophy, particularly in the centralized nuclei of small perifascicular muscle fibers expressing markers of regeneration. In injured mouse muscle tissue, Mi-2 levels were dramatically and persistently up-regulated during muscle regeneration in vivo. Premature silencing of Mi-2 with RNA interference in vitro resulted in accelerated myoblast differentiation. Expression of Mi-2 is markedly up-regulated during muscle regeneration in a mouse model of muscle injury and repair. It is also up-regulated in human DM myofibers expressing markers of regeneration. Results of the in vitro studies indicate that this protein may play a role in modulating the kinetics of myoblast differentiation. Our findings thus suggest that high levels of Mi-2 expression in muscle biopsy tissue from patients with DM reflect the presence of incompletely differentiated muscle cells.

Removal of rhodamine B (a basic dye) and thoron (an acidic dye) from dilute aqueous solutions and wastewater simulants by ion flotation. The present work deals with removal, by ion flotation, of two dyes: a basic dye (rhodamine B (RB)) and an acidic one (thoron (TH)) from dilute aqueous solutions and simulated wastewaters. These dyes are widely used for analytical and biological staining purposes. Besides, RB is commonly used in dyeing of various industrial products. Therefore, wastewaters emanating from chemical and radiochemical laboratories, and biomedical and biological research laboratories may be contaminated with RB and TH. Ion flotation of these dyes has been investigated over a wide range of pH using the anionic surfactant, sodium lauryl sulfate (NaLS) and the cationic surfactant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as collectors. Successful removals could be achieved for RB and TH with the anionic collector, NaLS, and the cationic collector, CTAB, respectively. In addition to the effects of pH and type of collector on the efficiency of removal of each dye, the effects of collector and dye concentrations, frother dosage, ionic strength, bubbling time period and presence of foreign salts were investigated and the optimal removal conditions have been established. Removals exceeding 99.5 % and 99.9% could be achieved for RB and TH, respectively. The results obtained are discussed with respect to dissociation of dye, type of collector, ionic strength and sign and magnitude of charge of added foreign ions. Kinetics of flotation were also studied. Further studies demonstrate that under optimum conditions the developed flotation processes can be applied for the treatment of dye-contaminated wastewaters simulated to those generated at dyeing industries and radiochemical laboratories.

Frequency matching of vocalizations to inner-ear sensitivity along an altitudinal gradient in the coqui frog. Acoustic communication involves both the generation and the detection of a signal. In the coqui frog (Eleutherodactylus coqui), it is known that the spectral contents of its calls systematically change with altitude above sea level. Here, distortion product otoacoustic emissions are used to assess the frequency range over which the inner ear is sensitive. It is found that both the spectral contents of the calls and the inner-ear sensitivity change in a similar fashion along an altitudinal gradient. As a result, the call frequencies and the auditory tuning are closely matched at all altitudes. We suggest that the animal's body size determines the frequency particulars of the call apparatus and the inner ear.

Homochiral stereochemistry: the missing link of structure to energetics in protein folding. The notion is tested that homochiral stereochemistry being ubiquitous to protein structure could be critical to protein folding as well, causing it to become frustrated energetically providing the basis for its solvent- and sequence-mediated control. The proof in support of the notion is found in a consensus of experiment and computation according to which suitable oligopeptides are in their folding-unfolding equilibria, at both macrostate and microstate levels, susceptible to dielectric because of the conflict of peptide-chain electrostatics with interpeptide hydrogen bonds when the structure is poly-L but not when it is alternating-L,D. The argument is thus made that homochiral stereochemistry may in protein folding provide the unifying basis for its solvent- and sequence-mediated control based on screening of peptide-chain electrostatics under conflict with folding of the chain due to homochiral stereochemistry. Dielectric is brought into spotlight as the effect comparatively obscure but presumably critical to the folding in protein structure for its control.

Chlamydomonas as a "new" organism for biodiesel production. The production of biodiesel from a naturally isolated strain of Chlamydomonas was investigated. The microalgal strain was isolated from the rice paddy-field soil samples during a screening program. The identification was done using physiological and molecular approaches. After reaching the stationary phase of growth, the total content of the lipids was extracted. The extracted fatty acids were primarily esterified and then identified through TLC and GC/MS analysis. Several types of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) were identified in the isolated microalga and the presence of at least nine FAMEs in Chlamydomonas sp. MCCS 026 was shown. The total fatty acid content of the isolated strain was 25%. The composition of fatty acids in the studied species of microalga was mainly docosanoic acid methyl ester, tetradecanoic acid methyl ester, hexadecanoic acid methyl ester and nonanoic acid methyl ester.


Experimental and theoretical assessment of maximum productivities for the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in two different geometries of photobioreactors.

Nonlocal shear deformable shell model for postbuckling of axially compressed microtubules embedded in an elastic medium. Buckling and postbuckling analysis is presented for axially compressed microtubules (MTs) embedded in an elastic matrix of cytoplasm. The microtubule is modeled as a nonlocal shear deformable cylindrical shell which contains small scale effects. The surrounding elastic medium is modeled as a Pasternak foundation. The governing equations are based on higher order shear deformation shell theory with a von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n-Donnell-type of kinematic nonlinearity and include the extension-twist and flexural-twist couplings. The thermal effects are also included and the material properties are assumed to be temperature-dependent. The small scale parameter e (0) a is estimated by matching the buckling load from their vibrational behavior of MTs with the numerical results obtained from the nonlocal shear deformable shell model. The numerical results show that buckling load and postbuckling behavior of MTs are very sensitive to the small scale parameter e (0) a. The results reveal that the MTs under axial compressive loading condition have an unstable postbuckling path, and the lateral constraint has a significant effect on the postbuckling response of a microtubule when the foundation stiffness is sufficiently large.

Oral tremor induced by the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine is suppressed by the adenosine A2A antagonists MSX-3 and SCH58261, but not the adenosine A1 antagonist DPCPX. Tremulous jaw movements in rats, which can be induced by dopamine (DA) antagonists, DA depletion, and cholinomimetics, have served as a useful model for studies of tremor. Although adenosine A(2A) antagonists can reduce the tremulous jaw movements induced by DA antagonists and DA depletion, there are conflicting reports about the interaction between adenosine antagonists and cholinomimetic drugs. The present studies investigated the ability of adenosine antagonists to reverse the tremorogenic effect of the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine. While the adenosine A(2A) antagonist MSX-3 was incapable of reversing the tremulous jaw movements induced by the 4.0mg/kg dose of pilocarpine, both MSX-3 and the adenosine A(2A) antagonist SCH58261 reversed the tremulous jaw movements elicited by 0.5mg/kg pilocarpine. Systemic administration of the adenosine A(1) antagonist DPCPX failed to reverse the tremulous jaw movements induced by either an acute 0.5mg/kg dose of the cholinomimetic pilocarpine or the DA D2 antagonist pimozide, indicating that the tremorolytic effects of adenosine antagonists may be receptor subtype specific. Behaviorally active doses of MSX-3 and SCH 58261 showed substantial in vivo occupancy of A(2A) receptors, but DPCPX did not. The results of these studies support the use of adenosine A(2A) antagonists for the treatment of tremor.

Differential mucosal IL-17 expression in two gliadin-induced disorders: gluten sensitivity and the autoimmune enteropathy celiac disease. The immune-mediated enteropathy, celiac disease (CD), and gluten sensitivity (GS) are two distinct clinical conditions that are both triggered by the ingestion of wheat gliadin. CD, but not GS, is associated with and possibly mediated by an autoimmune process. Recent studies show that gliadin may induce the activation of IL-17-producing T cells and that IL-17 expression in the CD mucosa correlates with gluten intake. The small-intestinal mucosa of patients with CD and GS and dyspeptic controls was analyzed for expression of IL-17A mRNA by quantitative RT-PCR. The number of CD3+ and TCR-gammadelta lymphocytes and the proportion of CD3+ cells coexpressing the Th17 marker CCR6 were examined by in situ small-intestinal immunohistochemistry. Mucosal expression of IL-17A was significantly increased in CD but not in GS patients, compared to controls. This difference was due to enhanced IL-17A levels in >50% of CD patients, with the remainder expressing levels similar to GS patients or controls, and was paralleled by a trend toward increased proportions of CD3+CCR6+ cells in intestinal mucosal specimens from these subjects. We conclude that GS, albeit gluten-induced, is different from CD not only with respect to the genetic makeup and clinical and functional parameters, but also with respect to the nature of the immune response. Our findings also suggest that two subgroups of CD, IL-17-dependent and IL-17-independent, may be identified based on differential mucosal expression of this cytokine.

Can the pectoral fascia integrity be preserved during subfascial breast augmentation through the axillary approach? Although many authors recently have reported good results with subfascial breast augmentation, it still is controversial whether the integrity of the pectoral fascia can be preserved. Some authors think the pectoral fascia will be broken during the operation because it is thin and weak. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate whether the integrity of the pectoral fascia can be preserved during subfascial breast augmentation through an axillary incision without endoscopic assistance. For this study, 10 patients underwent subfascial augmentation mammaplasty through the axillary approach. The technique was used for patients with small or moderate breasts. The pockets were made with the fingers. The area beyond the reach of the fingers was dissected using a breast dissector. Then the pocket and major pectoral fascias were examined with an endoscope. The endoscope was used only to inspect the fascia and major pectoral muscle after the subfascial dissection was completed. The fascia and surgical effects were evaluated. The integrity of 11 (55%) of 20 pectoral fascias in 10 patients was preserved during the surgery. Four fascias (20%) were broken at about the fourth intercostal space or at the fifth costa. In five breasts (25%), the superficial layer of the pectoral muscle was split, but the integrity of the fascia was maintained. All the patients except one with asymmetric breasts achieved satisfactory results. There was no active bleeding, hematoma, infection, or fibrous capsule contracture during the follow-up period. The integrity of most pectoral fascias (11 + 5 fascias) could be preserved through the axillary approach during subfascial breast augmentation without endoscopic assistance. Even if the lower portion of the pectoral fascia was broken, this did not interfere with the aesthetic outcome or the normal postoperative recovery.

Activity of tacrolimus: an immunosuppressant, in pyloric ligation-induced peptic ulcer in the rat. The effect of tacrolimus (FK506) on peptic ulcer was evaluated using pyloric ligation (PL) model in rats. Tacrolimus was administered orally at different doses (1, 2 and 3 mg/kg) and it showed a gastric ulcer healing effect in a dose dependent manner. Gastric volume, total and free acidity and ulcerative index parameters were reduced in the tacrolimus treated rats as compared to pyloric ligated rats. The higher dose (3 mg/kg) treated group produced significant results similar to that of the ranitidine (50 mg/kg) treated group. Pretreatment with tacrolimus also produced significant (p<0.05) reduction in TBARS, total calcium, TNF-alpha, IL-8 and MPO whereas it showed an increase in GSH level at higher dose. The anti-secretory and anti-ulcerative effect of tacrolimus may be due to immunosuppressive actions by inhibition of calcineurin and the oxidative pathway. It can be concluded that tacrolimus can play an important role in the treatment of peptic ulcer disorder to improve the quality of life.

Hepatoprotective and anticlastogenic effects of ethanol extract of Irvingia gabonensis (IG) leaves in sodium arsenite-induced toxicity in male Wistar rats. Consumption of arsenic contaminated water has been associated with diverse health defects such as cancer and skin lesions. Some plants of medicinal value have been reported to show protective effects against toxins. In this study, the effects of ethanol extract of the leaves of Irvingia gabonensis (IG) against sodium arsenite (SA) induced hepatotoxicity and clastogenicity in male Wistar rats was investigated. Eight groups of five rats each were used for the study. They were administered with 250 or 500 mg/kg body weight of IG with or without SA at 2.5 mg/kg body weight. IG extract has a significant (p<0.05) reducing effect on serum liver function enzymes, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and gamma glutamyltransferase (Î³GT) activities. This was corroborated with the histopathological analysis findings. Also the groups treated with both the extract and SA recorded significantly (p<0.05) reduced number of micronuclei when compared with the group treated with SA only. IG extract also reduced the oxidative stress induced by SA as measured by the reduced generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and significant (p<0.05) difference in the CAT and SOD activities between the groups treated with both SA and extract, and the positive control group administered SA alone. This study therefore shows that the ethanol leaf extract of Irvingia gabonensis have hepatoprotective and anticlastogenic effects against sodium arsenite-induced toxicity possibly by enhancing the antioxidant status in the Wistar rats.

Rattle-type Fe(3)O(4)@SiO(2) hollow mesoporous spheres as carriers for drug delivery. Rattle-type Fe(3)O(4)@SiO(2) hollow mesoporous spheres with different particle sizes, different mesoporous shell thicknesses, and different levels of Fe(3)O(4) content are prepared by using carbon spheres as templates. The effects of particle size and concentration of Fe(3)O(4)@SiO(2) hollow mesoporous spheres on cell uptake and their in vitro cytotoxicity to HeLa cells are evaluated. The spheres exhibit relatively fast cell uptake. Concentrations of up to 150 microg mL(-1) show no cytotoxicity, whereas a concentration of 200 microg mL(-1) shows a small amount of cytotoxicity after 48 h of incubation. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX), an anticancer drug, is loaded into the Fe(3)O(4)@SiO(2) hollow mesoporous spheres, and the DOX-loaded spheres exhibit a somewhat higher cytotoxicity than free DOX. These results indicate the potential of Fe(3)O(4)@SiO(2) hollow mesoporous spheres for drug loading and delivery into cancer cells to induce cell death.

Single HCC smaller than 2 cm: surgery or ablation?: surgeon's perspective. For hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) are accepted as effective treatments. To clarify the long-term outcome in patients with small HCC, we analyzed data from a nationwide survey of Japan. Between 2000 and 2003, a total of 2,550 patients who had undergone resection (n = 1,235) or RFA (n = 1,315) for single small HCC (<or=2 cm) were registered to the database of the Liver Cancer Study Group of Japan (LCSGJ). After a median follow-up period of 37 months, disease-free survival after resection was significantly better than after RFA (1-year, 91 vs. 87%; 2-year, 46 vs. 25%; P = 0.001), but overall survival after resection and RFA were similar (98 vs. 99%; 94 vs. 95%, P = 0.28). In the patients of Child-Pugh class A, disease-free survival was significantly better after resection (n = 1,056) than after RFA (n = 965) (P = 0.001), while overall survival was not significantly different (P = 0.16). In the patients of Child-Pugh class B, both disease-free and overall survival were almost similar (P = 0.63 and P = 0.66) after resection (n = 136) and RFA (n = 303). For single small HCC (<or=2 cm), surgical resection provides better disease-free survival than does RFA. Longer follow-up is needed to regard this indication as conclusive.

Pimecrolimus 1% cream, methylprednisolone aceponate 0.1% cream and metronidazole 0.75% gel in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis: a randomized clinical study. Seborrhoeic dermatitis is a common, chronic, papulosquamous dermatosis. Treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis includes topical treatments such as corticosteroids, antifungals, metronidazole and pimecrolimus. This study aimed to compare and contrast the efficacy and tolerability of pimecrolimus cream 1%, methylprednisolone aceponate 0.1% cream and metronidazole 0.75% gel topical treatments in the treatment of facial seborrhoeic dermatitis. The study included a total of 64 (32 males and 32 females) consecutive patients with facial seborrhoeic dermatitis. Patients were randomized into three equal groups. One group applied pimecrolimus 1% cream, another group applied methylprednisolone aceponate 0.1% cream, and the third group applied metronidazole 0.75% gel to their facial lesions twice daily for 8 weeks. Assessment of the disease severity was performed at baseline and at weeks 2, 4, and 8. Clinical measures assessed were erythema, scaling and pruritus, which were evaluated using a four-point scale (0-3). Of the 64 patients, 17 (80%) in the metronidazole group, 21 (100%) in the pimecrolimus group and 22 (100%) in the methylprednisolone aceponate group completed the study. Four patients in the metronidazole group left the study. All of the therapeutic agents were found to be effective; however, the efficacy of pimecrolimus was higher than those of metronidazole and methylprednisolone (p < 0.05). When side effects associated with pimecrolimus and metronidazole were compared, the latter was found to be associated with more side effects (p < 0.05). We suggest pimecrolimus to be a therapeutic option for seborrhoeic dermatitis cases that show an unfavourable response to methylprednisolone aceponate.

Bacterial communities associated with flea vectors of plague. The microbial flora associated with fleas may affect their ability to transmit specific pathogens, including Yersinia pestis, and also could be used to develop paratransgenesis-based approaches to interfere with transmission. To begin addressing this hypothesis, the microbial flora associated with the relatively efficient Y. pestis vectors Xenopsylla cheopis (Rothschild) (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae) and Oropsyllamontana (Baker) (Siphonaptera: Ceratophyllidae), and the inefficient vector Ctenocephalides felis felis (BouchÃ©) (Siphonaptera: Pulicidae) were investigated using polymerase chain reaction amplification of 16S rDNA genes. DNA sequencing revealed that these species harbor distinct communities of microbial flora and suggest that Acinetobacter sp. might be used in developing anti-transmission strategies.

Autosomal Recessive Bestrophinopathy Is Not Associated With the Loss of Bestrophin-1 Anion Channel Function in a Patient With a Novel BEST1 Mutation.

Disposition of a new tamibarotene prodrug in mice. Recently, a new compound IT-M-07000 was designed as a prodrug of tamibarotene, one of the therapeutic agents for acute promyelocytic leukemia. In the present study, IT-M-07000 was administered to mice to investigate whether it is actually metabolized to tamibarotene. Its metabolic pathway and the utility as a tamibarotene prodrug were also evaluated. After oral administration of IT-M-07000, IT-M-07000, tamibarotene and two compounds that were supposed to be metabolic intermediates in a beta-oxidation pathway of IT-M-07000 to tamibarotene were detected in mouse plasma. It was thus shown that IT-M-07000 is probably beta-oxidized to tamibarotene in mice. Comparison of tamibarotene concentration profiles after oral administration of IT-M-07000 or tamibarotene showed that the plasma tamibarotene concentration increased slower and was retained stable, and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of tamibarotene was larger in mice administered IT-M-07000 than tamibarotene. These results indicate that IT-M-07000 is possibly useful as a prodrug of tamibarotene.

A review of the limitations of the first hydrogel contact lenses. It is generally believed that the clinical performance of the original Czechoslovakian hydrogel contact lenses was poor but historical reviews provide very little explanation regarding their failings. There is a lack of information in the literature about their dimensions and, in particular, thickness, which is essential for the calculation of oxygen transmissibility. Until now no measurements on Czechoslovakian lenses have been reported. A literature search on Czechoslovakian lenses was made that spanned the first decade of their use and included peer-reviewed journals, non-refereed publications and a number of archived documents. In addition, the water content and dimensions of five Geltakt and four Spofa lenses were measured. Lens packaging, lens lifetime, hygienic care, visual acuity, nominal lens dimensions, flexure, failure to correct astigmatism, corneal oedema, oxygen transmissibility, complications and wearing time are reviewed. Measurements on Czechoslovakian lenses indicate that the total diameter was similar to that of the cornea, the back optic zone radius was steep and the centre thickness was large. Problems associated with the Czechoslovakian lenses included packaging and an initial failure to require daily disinfection. Few complications of lens wear were reported, probably due to the comparatively small number of patients fitted and the limited wearing time that they achieved. Delayed disclosure of lens dimensions handicapped the development of a fitting technique. An acceptable visual acuity was attained in selected cases, while reduced acuity may sometimes have been due to uncorrected astigmatism or to poor lens quality. The most serious disadvantage was the very low oxygen transmissibility that could result in marked corneal oedema.

Modelling interactions of acid-base balance and respiratory status in the toxicity of metal mixtures in the American oyster Crassostrea virginica. Heavy metals, such as copper, zinc and cadmium, represent some of the most common and serious pollutants in coastal estuaries. In the present study, we used a combination of linear and artificial neural network (ANN) modelling to detect and explore interactions among low-dose mixtures of these heavy metals and their impacts on fundamental physiological processes in tissues of the Eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica. Animals were exposed to Cd (0.001-0.400 microM), Zn (0.001-3.059 microM) or Cu (0.002-0.787 microM), either alone or in combination for 1 to 27 days. We measured indicators of acid-base balance (hemolymph pH and total CO(2)), gas exchange (Po(2)), immunocompetence (total hemocyte counts, numbers of invasive bacteria), antioxidant status (glutathione, GSH), oxidative damage (lipid peroxidation; LPx), and metal accumulation in the gill and the hepatopancreas. Linear analysis showed that oxidative membrane damage from tissue accumulation of environmental metals was correlated with impaired acid-base balance in oysters. ANN analysis revealed interactions of metals with hemolymph acid-base chemistry in predicting oxidative damage that were not evident from linear analyses. These results highlight the usefulness of machine learning approaches, such as ANNs, for improving our ability to recognize and understand the effects of sub-acute exposure to contaminant mixtures.

Multiresolution entropy measure for neuronal multiunit activity. It is known that the multiunit activity (MUA) reflects the status of population of neurons in the vicinity of an electrode. We provide a quantitative measure of the time-varying multiunit neuronal spiking activity using an entropy based approach. To verify the status embedded in the neuronal activity of a population of neurons, we incorporate the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) to isolate the inherent spiking activity of MUA from the noise and background cortical activity or field potentials. Owing to the decorrelating property of DWT, the spiking activity would be preserved while reducing the non-spiking component such as the background noise. By evaluating the entropy of the wavelet coefficients of the denoised MUA, a multiresolution entropy of the MUA signal is developed. The proposed entropy measure was tested in the analysis of both simulated noisy MUA and actual MUA recorded from cortex in rodent model which undergoes hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. Simulation and Experimental results demonstrate that the dynamics of a population can be quantified by using the proposed multiresolution entropy.

Differences in the pathophysiological profile of IR in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) are not characterized in detail. The aim of this study was to evaluate features of IR in HFpEF vs. HFrEF. We included 18 patients with HFrEF (EF 30 Â± 11%, body mass index (BMI) 26.5 Â± 3.3 kg/m(2)), 22 HFpEF patients (EF 63 Â± 7%, BMI 28.6 Â± 4.8 kg/m(2)), and 20 healthy controls of similar age, all without diabetes mellitus. Patients were in stable ambulatory condition and on stable medical regimens for HF. IR was assessed at fasting steady state by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index and within the physiological range of insulin-glucose interactions by the short insulin sensitivity test (SIST). Fasting-state IR was observed in HFpEF and in HFrEF in comparison with controls (HOMA 1.9, interquartile range (IQR) 1.5-3.6 vs. HOMA 3.1, IQR 1.4-3.7 vs. controls 1.2, IQR 1.8-0.9, respectively; analysis of variance P < 0.001), but no statistical difference was observed between HFpEF and HFrEF. The dynamic test over the physiological range of insulin-glucose interactions revealed a more severe IR in HFrEF as compared with HFpEF. Thus, glucose levels remained the highest in HFrEF (76 (64-89) mg/dL) at the end of the SIST compared with HFpEF and controls (68 (58-79) and 56 (44-66) mg/dL, respectively, P < 0.001). IR is present in non-diabetic patients with HFpEF and HFrEF. However, distinct differences in the insulin sensitivity characteristics in HFpEF and HFrEF become apparent by more advanced testing. Patients with HFrEF showed more severe IR.

Topical antioxidant application augments the effects of intense pulsed light therapy. There has been great interest in improving the efficacy of nonablative technologies by combining them during facial skin rejuvenation. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the addition of topical polyphenolic antioxidants to an intense pulsed light (IPL) treatment regimen augmented the effects of facial IPL treatments. Thirty female volunteers, ages 34-52, with skin phototypes 1-3 were randomly assigned into three groups: group A (n = 10) received three full-face IPL treatments spaced 3 weeks apart; group B (n = 10) underwent 6-weekly full-face treatments of a pneumatically applied topical polyphenolic antioxidant solution; group C (n = 10) received the combination of the three full-face IPL treatments and the six full-face topical antioxidant applications. Skin biopsies, skin polyphenolic antioxidant levels, and skin moisture content levels were obtained and clinical efficacy variables were noted prior to and following the treatment period. Compared to group A, group C demonstrated significantly greater epidermal and papillary dermal thickness, decreased lipid peroxide concentration, increased skin moisture content, and increased polyphenolic antioxidants levels (P < 0.05). There was qualitative improvement in hydration, texture, and pore size. Compared to group B, group C demonstrated significantly greater papillary dermal thickness (P < 0.05), and qualitative improvement in reduction of fine lines, reduction of hyperpigmentation, and skin dullness. group B and group C had equivalent polyphenolic antioxidant levels, lipid peroxide concentration, and epidermal thickness. The addition of polyphenolic antioxidants to an IPL regimen improved the clinical, biochemical, and histological changes seen following IPL treatment alone. These data support the use of multimodal therapy to create synergy and to optimize clinical outcomes in nonablative facial skin rejuvenation.

A flexible pressure monitoring system for pressure ulcer prevention. Pressure ulcers are painful sores that arise from prolonged exposure to high pressure points, which restricts blood flow and leads to tissue necrosis. This is a common occurrence among patients with impaired mobility, diabetics and the elderly. In this work, a flexible pressure monitoring system for pressure ulcer prevention has been developed. The prototype consists of 99 capacitive pressure sensors on a 17-cm x 22-cm sheet which is flexible in two dimensions. Due to its low cost, the sensor sheet can be disconnected from the reusable electronics and be disposed of after use, suitable for a clinical setting. Each sensor has a resolution of better than 2-mmHg and a range of 50-mmHg and offset is calibrated in software. Realtime pressure data is displayed on a computer. A maximum sampling rate of 12-Hz allows for continuous monitoring of pressure points.

Seroprevalence of Leptospira spp. in clinically healthy racing horses in Korea. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease of global importance, and has a worldwide distribution. The present study aimed to determine leptospiral seroprevalence in clinically healthy racing horses from all three racecourses in Korea. Serum samples from 1,226 racing horses were examined using a microscopic agglutination test to detect the presence of antibodies against 18 Leptospira serovars. Of the tested samples, 307 (25.0%) were found to be positive. The distribution of seroprevalence differed significantly by racecourse (P=0.004); the Jeju course had the highest incidence (31.1%), followed by the Seoul (25.2%) and Busan (19.5%) racecourses. Seasonal variation in seropositivity was also apparent (P=0.000), being lower in spring (13.0%) and winter (12.5%), and higher in summer (36.7%) and autumn (34.7%). No significant age- or gender-related difference in seroprevalence was noted in this study (P>0.05). Seroprevalence was higher (P=0.006) among ponies than among thoroughbreds. Sejroe was the most frequently detected serovar (n=236), followed by Bratislava (n=35), Ballum (n=16), Autumnalis (n=10), and Canicola (n=10). The majority of serum titers were relatively low; most values ranged from 1:100 (n=217) to 1:200 (n=69). These results suggest that the Sejroe serovar may be maintained in the racing horse population in Korea.

Presence of As in the fluvial network due to AMD processes in the Riotinto mining area (SW Spain): a fuzzy logic qualitative model. The Tinto River crosses the mining area of Riotinto (Iberian Pyrite Belt, SW Spain), where it receives the highest contribution of contaminants (AMD). In this paper we apply a fuzzy computer tool, PreFuRGe, which allows qualitative interpretation of the data recorded in a database relating to the chemistry of water. Specifically, we aim to find information not likely to be detected by means of classical statistical techniques, and which can help in characterizing and interpreting the behavior of arsenic in a complex system. The conclusions present that the factors which most directly control the presence of total dissolved As are closely linked to the climate and are temperature and rainfall, and therefore pH. As (III) is also shown to be related to temperature and pH. In terms of temperature As (V) is found to operate in a way which is the opposite of As (III). In terms of pH the relationship is not as clear as for As (III). As for rain, the highest As (V) values are compatible with minimum or non-existent rainfall, while minimum values correspond to any value for rainfall, including very high.

Long-lasting antinociceptive spinal effects in primates of the novel nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor agonist UFP-112. Chemical modifications of nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide that result in increased potency and resistance to degradation have recently lead to the discovery of [(pF)Phe(4)Aib(7)Arg(14)Lys(15)]N/OFQ-NH(2) (UFP-112), a novel N/OFQ peptide (NOP) receptor agonist. The aim of this study was to investigate the pharmacological profile of intrathecally administered UFP-112 in monkeys under different behavioral assays. Intrathecal UFP-112 (1-10 nmol) dose-dependently produced antinociception against an acute noxious stimulus (50 degrees C water) and capsaicin-induced thermal hyperalgesia. Intrathecal UFP-112-induced antinociception could be reversed by a NOP receptor antagonist, J-113397 (0.1mg/kg), but not by a classic opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone (0.03 mg/kg). Like intrathecal morphine, UFP-112 produced antinociception in two primate pain models with a similar magnitude of effectiveness and a similar duration of action that last for 4-5h. Unlike intrathecal morphine, UFP-112 did not produce itch/scratching responses. In addition, intrathecal inactive doses of UFP-112 and morphine produced significant antinociceptive effects when given in combination without increasing scratching responses. These results demonstrated that intrathecal UFP-112 produced long-lasting morphine-comparable antinociceptive effects without potential itch side effect. This study is the first to provide functional evidence that selective NOP receptor agonists such as UFP-112 alone or in conjunction with morphine may improve the quality of spinal analgesia.

Neuroanatomical correlates of cognitive self-appraisal in neurodegenerative disease. Self-appraisal is a critical cognitive function, which helps us to choose tasks based on an accurate assessment of our abilities. The neural mechanisms of self-appraisal are incompletely understood, although a growing body of literature suggests that several frontal and subcortical regions are important for self-related processing. Anosognosia, or lack of awareness of one's deficits, is common in neurodegenerative dementias, offering an important window onto the brain systems involved in self-appraisal. We examined the neuroanatomical basis of self-appraisal in a mixed group of 39 individuals, including 35 with cognitive impairment due to one of several probable neurodegenerative diseases, using voxel-based morphometry and an objective, neuropsychologically-based measure of self-appraisal accuracy. Self-appraisal accuracy was correlated with tissue content in the right ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC). We hypothesize that emotional/physiological processing carried out by vmPFC is an important factor mediating self-appraisal accuracy in dementia.

A sample preparation protocol for 1H nuclear magnetic resonance studies of water-soluble metabolites in blood and urine. We describe a general protocol for preparing protein-containing biofluids for (1)H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomic studies. In this protocol, untreated samples are diluted in deuterated solvents to precipitate proteins and recover metabolites quantitated relative to standard reference compounds such as 3-trimethylsilylpropionic acid (TSP) and 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonic acid (DSS). The efficacy of this protocol was tested using a bovine serum albumin/metabolite mix and human serum samples. This sample preparation method can be readily applied to any protein-containing biofluid for (1)H NMR studies.


Sexual dysfunctions and lower urinary tract symptoms in ankylosing spondylitis.

Reversal of the myosin power stroke induced by fast stretching of intact skeletal muscle fibers. Force generation and movement in skeletal muscle result from a cyclical interaction of overlapping myosin and actin filaments that permits the free energy of ATP hydrolysis to be converted into mechanical work. The rapid force recovery that occurs after a step release imposed on a muscle is thought to result from a synchronized tilting of myosin lever arms toward a position of lower free energy (the power stroke). We investigated the power stroke mechanism in intact muscle fibers of Rana esculenta using a fast stretch to detach forcibly cross-bridges. Stretches were applied either with or without a conditioning step release. Cross-bridge rupture tension was not significantly influenced by the release, whereas sarcomere elongation at the rupture point increased immediately after the release and returned to the prerelease condition within 15-20 ms, following a slower time course compared to the recovery of tension. These observations suggest that the rupture force of a bridge is unaltered by a conditioning release, but rupture must first be preceded by a power stroke reversal, which restores the prepower stroke state. The sarcomere extension at the rupture point indicates both the extent of this power stroke reversal and the time course of strained bridge replenishment.

Attempt of a novel calibration method of pulse oximetry using support vector machines regression. A novel calibration method using support vector machines regression (SVMsR) of pulse oximetry was proposed and attempted. Conventional calibration method of pulse oximetry that based on an optical density ratio of transmitted visible red light and infrared radiation whereas a proposed method here was not based on the optical density ratio directly. In theory, conventional calibrations using the ratio can be considered as a technique for nonlinear problem: nonlinear relation between two optical densities (red and IR) and oxygen saturation could be linearized by the ratio calculation. We thought, that nonlinear problem could be solved by using nonlinear analyses. Among them, the support vector machines regression method that has been studied well in this decade was attempted to be applied for pulse oximetry calibration. As an experiment, two photo plethysmograms (PPGs) by red and IR were measured on five subjects. Simultaneously, oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) level was measured by a commercial pulse oxymeter. SpO(2)) level was controlled by breathing 10% oxygen gas obtaining 98-75% SpO(2) level. Sequentially, feature points of two PPGs were extracted in beat by beat. Convex peaks and concave valleys on waveform and DC levels of PPGs were selected as feature points. Then, nonlinear regression using SVMs were attempted to obtain relationship between SpO2 by meter (regressand) and feature points of PPG (regressor). In result, a regression model was constructed from training data that is three fourths of measured cardiac data by using SVMsR. Finally, the constructed calibration model was evaluated by other one third data (validation data). The root mean squared error for the validation data is 1.90 [SpO(2)) level %] and 89% of validation data fell within +/- 2 % of SpO(2) level by the meter. In conclusion, SVMsR might be applicable on calibration for pulse oximetry.

Overview of the Rapid Response data. The Type I Diabetes Genetics Consortium (T1DGC) Rapid Response Workshop was established to evaluate published candidate gene associations in a large collection of affected sib-pair (ASP) families. We report on our quality control (QC) and preliminary family-based association analyses. A random sample of blind duplicates was analyzed for QC. Quality checks, including examination of plate-panel yield, marker yield, Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, mismatch error rate, Mendelian error rate, and allele distribution across plates, were performed. Genotypes from 2324 families within nine cohorts were obtained from a panel of 21 candidate genes, including 384 single-nucleotide polymorphisms on two genotyping platforms performed at the Broad Institute Center for Genotyping and Analysis (Cambridge, MA, USA). The T1DGC Rapid Response project, following rigorous QC procedures, resulted in a 2297 family, 9688 genotyped individual database on a single-candidate gene panel. The available data include 9005 individuals with genotype data from both platforms and 683 individuals genotyped (276 in Illumina; 407 in Sequenom) on only one platform.

Thermodynamics, interfacial pressure isotherms and dilational rheology of mixed protein-surfactant adsorption layers. Proteins and their mixtures with surfactants are widely used in many applications. The knowledge of their solution bulk behavior and its impact on the properties of interfacial layers made great progress in the recent years. Different mechanisms apply to the formation process of protein/surfactant complexes for ionic and non-ionic surfactants, which are governed mainly by electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The surface activity of these complexes is often remarkably different from that of the individual protein and has to be considered in respective theoretical models. At very low protein concentration, small amounts of added surfactants can change the surface activity of proteins remarkably, even though no strongly interfacial active complexes are observed. Also small added amounts of non-ionic surfactants change the surface activity of proteins in the range of small bulk concentrations or surface coverages. The modeling of the equilibrium adsorption behavior of proteins and their mixtures with surfactants has reached a rather high level. These models are suitable also to describe the high frequency limits of the dilational viscoelasticity of the interfacial layers. Depending on the nature of the protein/surfactant interactions and the changes in the interfacial layer composition rather complex dilational viscoelasticities can be observed and described by the available models. The differences in the interfacial behavior, often observed in literature for studies using different experimental methods, are at least partially explained by a depletion of proteins, surfactants and their complexes in the range of low concentrations. A correction of these depletion effects typically provides good agreement between the data obtained with different methods, such as drop and bubble profile tensiometry.

[Influence of scorpion alcoholic extraction on mdr1 mRNA and P-gp expression in brain of phenytoin-resistant convulsive rats]. To study the anticonvulsive action of scorpion alcoholic extraction (SAE) on phenytoin-resistant convulsive rats made by direct cortical electrical stimulation in order to investigate the mechanism of antagonizing drug-resistance of SAE. Using the method of implanting microelectrodes in the cortical motor area of the brains of rats where the brain tissue was stimulated frequently by electricity through microelectrodes until igniting and then PHT (0.154 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)) ig for 7 days, We established phenytoin-resistant convulsive rat model. Total 6 groups were set up in the experiment: Normal control group, convulsion model control group (CMCG), phenytoin-resistant convulsion control group (PRCG), verapamil positive control group (VPCG, 0.0385 g x kg(-1)), scorpion alcohol extraction (SAE1, 6.5 g x kg(-1)) and scorpion alcohol extraction (SAE2, 13.0 g x kg(-1)). After ig both doses of SAE (6.5, 13.0 g x kg(-1)), the effects of SAE on the changes of convulsion threshold of phenytoin-resistant convulsive rats were observed. The method of RT-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the changes of mdrl gene expression and the method of immunohistochemistry (SABC) was adopted to determine the changes of P-gp expression. Both doses of SAE and verapamil (Ver) ig all raised the convulsant threshold of phenytoin-resistant rats (480.38 +/- 18.48) microA, there were statistical differences (P < 0.05) compared to themselves before drugs-treated. PHT was administrated, and mdrl mRNA and P-gp expression in PRCG was much higher than that in CMCG, with significantly statistical difference (P < 0.01); ig both doses of SAE and Ver all decreased mdrl mRNA and P-gp expression compared to PRCG respectively (P < 0.01). SAE and Ver ig all produce antagonizing action on phenytoin-resistant convulsive rat model. The machanism is related with inhabiting the mdrl mRNA expression and further decreasing the product P-gp.

Burkholderia pseudomallei Capsular Polysaccharide Recognition by a Monoclonal Antibody Reveals Key Details toward a Biodefense Vaccine and Diagnostics against Melioidosis. Burkholderia pseudomallei is the bacterium responsible for melioidosis, an infectious disease with high mortality rates. Since melioidosis is a significant public health concern in endemic regions and the organism is currently classified as a potential biothreat agent, the development of effective vaccines and rapid diagnostics is a priority. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) expressed by B. pseudomallei is a highly conserved virulence factor and a protective antigen. Because of this, CPS is considered an attractive antigen for use in the development of both vaccines and diagnostics. In the present study, we describe the interactions of CPS with the murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) 4C4 using a multidisciplinary approach including organic synthesis, molecular biology techniques, surface plasmon resonance, and nuclear magnetic spectroscopy. Using these methods, we determined the mode of binding between mAb 4C4 and native CPS or ad hoc synthesized capsular polysaccharide fragments. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the O-acetyl moiety of CPS is essential for the interaction of the CPS epitope with mAb 4C4. Collectively, our results provide important insights into the structural features of B. pseudomallei CPS that enable antibody recognition that may help the rational design of CPS-based vaccine candidates. In addition, our findings confirm that the mAb 4C4 is suitable for use in an antibody-based detection assay for diagnosis of B. pseudomallei infections.

Massage therapy services for healthcare: a telephone focus group study of drivers for clients' continued use of services. To explore opinions of why clients use, value and continue to seek massage therapy as a healthcare option. Telephone focus group methodology was used. Current and repeat users (n = 19) of either relaxation, remedial or sports massage therapy services participated in three telephone focus groups. Audiotaped semi-structured interviews were conducted. Telephone focus group with massage clients from provincial and urban localities in New Zealand. Summary of reported themes of the massage experience and suggested drivers for return to, or continuing with massage therapy. Data were transcribed, categorised (NVivo7) and thematically analysed using the general inductive approach. Key drivers for return to, or continuing with, massage therapy were: positive outcomes, expectations of goals being met, a regular appointment and the massage therapy culture. Massage therapy is perceived and valued as a personalised, holistic and hands-on approach to health management, which focuses on enhancing relaxation in conjunction with effective touch, within a positive client-therapist relationship and a pleasant non-rushed environment. Massage therapy as a health service is result and client driven but is reinforced by the culture of the experience.

Non-stenotic intracranial arteries have atherosclerotic changes in acute ischemic stroke patients: a 3T MRI study. The aim of this study is to evaluate the degree of atherosclerotic changes in intracranial arteries by assessing arterial wall thickness using T1-weighted 3D-turbo spin echo (3D-TSE) and time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA) in patients with acute ischemic stroke as compared with unaffected controls. Thirty-three patients with acute ischemic stroke and 36 control patients were analyzed. Acute ischemic stroke patients were divided according to TOAST classification. At both distal internal carotid arteries and basilar artery without stenosis, TOF-MRA was used to select non-stenotic portion of assessed arteries. 3D-TSE was used to measure the area including the lumen and wall (AreaOuter) and luminal area (AreaInner). The area of the vessel wall (AreaVW) of assessed intracranial arteries and the ratio index (RI) of each patient were determined. AreaInner, AreaOuter, AreaVW, and RI showed good inter-observer reliability and excellent intra-observer reliability. AreaInner did not significantly differ between stroke patients and controls (Pâ=â0.619). However, AreaOuter, AreaVW, and RI were significantly larger in stroke patients (Pâ<â0.001). The correlation coefficient between AreaInner and AreaOuter was higher in the controls (râ=â0.918) than in large vessel disease patients (râ=â0.778). RI of large vessel disease patients was significantly higher than that of normal control, small vessel disease, and cardioembolic groups. In patients with acute ischemic stroke, wall thickening and positive remodeling are evident in non-stenotic intracranial arteries. This change is more definite in stroke subtype that is related to atherosclerosis than that in other subtypes which are not.

Pain assessment is associated with decreased duration of mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit: a post Hoc analysis of the DOLOREA study. Critically ill patients frequently experience pain, but assessment rates remain below 40% in mechanically ventilated patients. Whether pain assessment affects patient outcomes is largely unknown. As part of a prospective cohort study of mechanically ventilated patients who received analgesia on day 2 of their stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), the investigators performed propensity-adjusted score analysis to compare the duration of ventilator support and duration of ICU stay between 513 patients who were assessed for pain and 631 patients who were not assessed for pain. Patients assessed for pain on day 2 were more likely to receive sedation level assessment, nonopioids, and dedicated analgesia during painful procedures than patients whose pain was not assessed. They also received fewer hypnotics and lower daily doses of midazolam. Patients with pain assessment had a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation (8 vs. 11 days; P < 0.01) and a reduced duration of stay in the ICU (13 vs. 18 days; P < 0.01). In propensity-adjusted score analysis, pain assessment was associated with increased odds of weaning from the ventilator (odds ratio, 1.40; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.98) and of discharge from the ICU (odds ratio, 1.43; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-2.00). Pain assessment in mechanically ventilated patients is independently associated with a reduction in the duration of ventilator support and of duration of ICU stay. This might be related to higher concomitant rates of sedation assessments and a restricted use of hypnotic drugs when pain is assessed.

Diploid spermatozoa caused by failure of the second meiotic division in a bull. An artificial insemination bull (Bos taurus) exhibiting 23% macrocephalic spermatozoa in the ejaculate was investigated. Spermatozoa with a projected head area of > or = 52 microm(2) were considered macrocephalic. Diploidy was assumed from the measurement of sperm head area and proved by flow cytometry, which was used to sort the sperm into haploid and diploid fractions. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was used to detect the sex chromosomes with an X-Y probe set. Diploid spermatozoa most likely originate from a defective second meiotic division (M2 diploids), as only 0.7% XY-bearing spermatozoa (M1 diploids) were detected in the spermatozoa of the flow cytometric diploid sort. The painting probes generated a single X or Y spot for both unsorted semen and diploid sorted spermatozoa. This indicates a close proximity of the nonpartitioned sister chromatids in the spermatozoa. The BC1.2 probe, which labels BTAYp13-12, was used to clarify the presence of the two chromatids in the singular signal of the simultaneously hybridized Y-painting probe. In scoring more than 1000 randomly sampled spermatozoa hybridized with the BC1.2 probe, 32% showed the YY diploid signal and 18% the Y signal. The sperm diploidy in this bull was caused by an incomplete partitioning of sister chromatids during the second meiotic division (M2) associated with a failure in nuclear cleavage.

Assessing the efficacy of protein farnesyltransferase inhibitors in mouse models of progeria. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is caused by the accumulation of a farnesylated form of prelamin A (progerin). Previously, we showed that blocking protein farnesylation with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor (FTI) ameliorates the disease phenotypes in mouse model of HGPS (Lmna(HG/+)). However, the interpretation of the FTI treatment studies is open to question in light of recent studies showing that mice expressing a nonfarnesylated version of progerin (Lmna(nHG/+)) develop progeria-like disease phenotypes. The fact that Lmna(nHG/+) mice manifest disease raised the possibility that the beneficial effects of an FTI in Lmna(HG/+) mice were not due to the effects of the drug on the farnesylation of progerin, but may have been due to unanticipated secondary effects of the drug on other farnesylated proteins. To address this issue, we compared the ability of an FTI to improve progeria-like disease phenotypes in both Lmna(HG/+) and Lmna(nHG/+) mice. In Lmna(HG/+) mice, the FTI reduced disease phenotypes in a highly significant manner, but the drug had no effect in Lmna(nHG/+) mice. The failure of the FTI to ameliorate disease in Lmna(nHG/+) mice supports the idea that the beneficial effects of an FTI in Lmna(HG/+) mice are due to the effect of drug on the farnesylation of progerin.

Bond strength and interfacial characterization of eight low fusing porcelains to cp Ti. The aim of this study was the interfacial characterization and the determination of bond strength of commercially available low fusing dental porcelain for Ti. Eight materials were included in this study: Duceratin, Duceratin Plus, Initial Ti, Ti-22, TiKrom, TitanKeramik, Triceram (powder) and Triceram (paste). Eight ISO 9693 bond characterization specimens from each porcelain were prepared according to manufacturers' instructions. One specimen from each group was embedded in acrylic resin and after metallographic preparation was studied under an SEM. Interfacial characterization was carried out with Backscattered Electron Imaging and X-ray EDS analysis operating in line scan mode. Metal-ceramic specimens were tested in three point bending at a crosshead speed of 1.5mm/min according to ISO 9693 requirements. Additionally the fracture mode (adhesive-cohesive) of all specimens was evaluated employing SEM/EDS analysis. The results of bond strength and adhesive percentage were statistically analysed with one-way ANOVA and SNK multiple comparison test (a=0.05). Additionally the possible correlation between the bond strength and fracture mode was also tested using Pearson test. Interfacial characterization showed the mutual diffusion of Ti, Si, O and La along the Ti-ceramic interface. Only in Tricerap (paste) Zr showed an increased concentration at the interface. The results of bond strength classified the materials in the following decreasing order: TiKrom>Duceratin>InitialTi>Duceratin Plus>Ti-22>Triceram(paste)>Triceram(powder)>TitanKeramik. No correlation (r=0.132) between the fracture mode and bond strength of the selected material denoting that the fracture mode is irrelevant with the bond strength of Ti-ceramic joint and thus the former should not be applied for comparison among different materials. According to the results of this study the materials tested provided great difference in interfacial analysis and bond strength with metallic Ti.

Laparoscopic pancreatic resection. Though initially slow to gain acceptance, the minimally invasive approach to pancreatic resection grew during the last decade and pancreatic operations such as the distal pancreatectomy and pancreatic enucleation are frequently performed laparoscopically. More complex operations such as the pancreaticoduodenectomy may also confer benefits with a minimally invasive approach but are less widely utilized. Though most research to date comparing open and laparoscopic pancreatectomy is retrospective, the current data suggest that compared with open, a laparoscopic procedure may afford postoperative benefits such as less blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and fewer wound complications. Regarding oncologic considerations, despite initial concerns, laparoscopic resection appears to be non-inferior to an open procedure in terms of lymph node retrieval, negative margin rates, and long-term survival. New technologies, such as robotics, are also gaining acceptance. Data show that while the laparoscopic approach incurs higher cost in the operating room, the resulting shorter hospital stay appears to be associated with an equivalent or lower overall cost. The minimally invasive approach to pancreatic resection can be safe and appropriate with significant patient benefits and oncologic non-inferiority based on existing data.

Comparison of experts and non-experts in throwing darts based on optimization criteria. Acquiring skillful movements of experts is a difficult task in many fields. Since non-experts often fail to find out how to improve their skill, it is desirable to find quantitative indices of skillful movements that clarify the difference between experts and non-experts. If we find quantitative indices, we can develop an adaptive training system using the indices. In this study, we quantitatively compare dart-throwing movements between experts and non-experts based on their scores, motions, and EMG signals. First, we show that the variance of upper-limb motion trajectories of the experts is significantly smaller than that of the non-experts. Then, we show that the displacement and the variance of the shoulder of the experts are also significantly smaller than those of the non-experts. The final result is the highlight of this study. We investigated their upper-limb motions from the viewpoint of trajectory optimization. In this study, we focus on two popular optimization criteria, i.e., sum of squared jerk over a trajectory and sum of squared joint-torque change over a trajectory. We present that the sum of squared joint torques of the subjects was negatively correlated with their scores (p < 0.05), whereas the other criteria were not.

A multi-factor model for caspase degradome prediction. Caspases belong to a class of cysteine proteases which function as critical effectors in cellular processes such as apoptosis and inflammation by cleaving substrates immediately after unique tetrapeptide sites. With hundreds of reported substrates and many more expected to be discovered, the elucidation of the caspase degradome will be an important milestone in the study of these proteases in human health and disease. Several computational methods for predicting caspase cleavage sites have been developed recently for identifying potential substrates. However, as most of these methods are based primarily on the detection of the tetrapeptide cleavage sites - a factor necessary but not sufficient for predicting in vivo substrate cleavage - prediction outcomes will inevitably include many false positives. In this paper, we show that structural factors such as the presence of disorder and solvent exposure in the vicinity of the cleavage site are important and can be used to enhance results from cleavage site prediction. We constructed a two-step model incorporating cleavage site prediction and these factors to predict caspase substrates. Sequences are first predicted for cleavage sites using CASVM or GraBCas. Predicted cleavage sites are then scored, ranked and filtered against a cut-off based on their propensities for locating in disordered and solvent exposed regions. Using an independent dataset of caspase substrates, the model was shown to achieve greater positive predictive values compared to CASVM or GraBCas alone, and was able to reduce the false positives pool by up to 13% and 53% respectively while retaining all true positives. We applied our prediction model on the family of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and highlighted several members as potential caspase targets. The results suggest that RTKs may be generally regulated by caspase cleavage and in some cases, promote the induction of apoptotic cell death - a function distinct from their role as transducers of survival and growth signals. As a step towards the prediction of in vivo caspase substrates, we have developed an accurate method incorporating cleavage site prediction and structural factors. The multi-factor model augments existing methods and complements experimental efforts to define the caspase degradome on the systems-wide basis.

Effect of propranolol on angiogenic factors in human hematopoietic cell lines in vitro. Beta-adrenergic blocking agents have been broadly used for treatment of many cardiovascular diseases such as arterial hypertension and ischemic heart failure. Anti-tumoral, anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenesis effects of propranolol (a non-selective beta-adrenergic blocker) have been shown. Angiogenesis (replenish of the pre-existing vascular networks) plays a critical role in some pathological conditions such as tumor expansion and metastasis. In this study, we investigated the effects of propranolol on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) production and matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity (two important angiogenic factors) in human leukemic cell lines in vitro. Two human leukemic T (Molt-4 and Jurkat) and one monocyte (U937) cell lines were used in this study. The cells were cultured in complete RPMI medium and then incubated with different concentrations of propranolol (0.3-30 microM) in the presence or absence of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA, 25 ng/ml) for 48 hours. The level of VEGF secreted in the cell culture supernatants was measured with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (R and D systems) and MMP-2 activity in cell-conditioned media was evaluated by gelatin zymography. Propranolol significantly decreased VEGF production and also MMP-2 activity in PMA-activated human leukemic cell lines Molt-4, Jurkat and U937 at 30 microM concentration of the drug compared to untreated control cells (P<0.05). Propranolol might be a useful anti-angiogenic agent in hematopoietic malignancies. Thus, propranolol along with its chronic long-term usage in cardiac problems may have potential implication in treatment of leukemia.

Poxvirus proteomics and virus-host protein interactions. Studies of the functional proteins encoded by the poxvirus genome provide information about the composition of the virus as well as individual virus-virus protein and virus-host protein interactions, which provides insight into viral pathogenesis and drug discovery. Widely used proteomic techniques to identify and characterize specific protein-protein interactions include yeast two-hybrid studies and coimmunoprecipitations. Recently, various mass spectrometry techniques have been employed to identify viral protein components of larger complexes. These methods, combined with structural studies, can provide new information about the putative functions of viral proteins as well as insights into virus-host interaction dynamics. For viral proteins of unknown function, identification of either viral or host binding partners provides clues about their putative function. In this review, we discuss poxvirus proteomics, including the use of proteomic methodologies to identify viral components and virus-host protein interactions. High-throughput global protein expression studies using protein chip technology as well as new methods for validating putative protein-protein interactions are also discussed.

Efficacy of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, for the treatment of dysmenorrhea: a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. To investigate the effectiveness of montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, in alleviating the symptoms of dysmenorrhea. This prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study was comprised of 62 patients with dysmenorrhea who were randomly divided into 2 groups (montelukast and placebo). Data obtained from 50 patients were analyzed (montelukast: 24; placebo: 26). Using visual analog scale (VAS) scores and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) usage per menstrual cycle, values before treatment were compared to average scores over two menstrual cycles with treatment. Both the VAS scores and NSAID usage decreased significantly in both groups. The decreases were greater in the montelukast group compared to the placebo group, but the differences were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, in "highly effective cases," which were defined as having a post-treatment value less than half of the pre-treatment value, the decreases were significantly greater in the montelukast group than in the placebo group (VAS: montelukast, 4 vs. placebo, 0 (P=0.029); NSAID: montelukast, 9 vs. placebo, 3 (P=0.031)). The present study found that montelukast may be effective in alleviating pain associated with dysmenorrhea in some women. Montelukast is safe and does not influence hormonal levels. Therefore, montelukast is a clinically reasonable management option to consider before prescribing a hormonal agent.

Development of biomaterial scaffold for nerve tissue engineering: Biomaterial mediated neural regeneration. Neural tissue repair and regeneration strategies have received a great deal of attention because it directly affects the quality of the patient's life. There are many scientific challenges to regenerate nerve while using conventional autologous nerve grafts and from the newly developed therapeutic strategies for the reconstruction of damaged nerves. Recent advancements in nerve regeneration have involved the application of tissue engineering principles and this has evolved a new perspective to neural therapy. The success of neural tissue engineering is mainly based on the regulation of cell behavior and tissue progression through the development of a synthetic scaffold that is analogous to the natural extracellular matrix and can support three-dimensional cell cultures. As the natural extracellular matrix provides an ideal environment for topographical, electrical and chemical cues to the adhesion and proliferation of neural cells, there exists a need to develop a synthetic scaffold that would be biocompatible, immunologically inert, conducting, biodegradable, and infection-resistant biomaterial to support neurite outgrowth. This review outlines the rationale for effective neural tissue engineering through the use of suitable biomaterials and scaffolding techniques for fabrication of a construct that would allow the neurons to adhere, proliferate and eventually form nerves.

Regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) by thyroid hormone: role of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC-1 alpha).

Presynaptic BK type Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels are involved in prostanoid TP receptor-mediated inhibition of noradrenaline release from the rat gastric sympathetic nerves. Previously, we reported that prostanoid TP receptor mediates the inhibition of electrically evoked noradrenaline release from gastric sympathetic nerves in rats. Prostanoid TP receptor has been shown to activate phospholipase C (PLC), which catalyzes the hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP(3)) and diacylglycerol; IP(3) triggers the release of Ca(2+) from intracellular stores and diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C. In the present study, therefore, we examined whether these PLC-mediated mechanisms are involved in the TP receptor-mediated inhibition of gastric noradrenaline release using an isolated, vascularly perfused rat stomach. U-46619 (9,11-dideoxy-9alpha,11alpha-methanoepoxy PGF(2alpha)) (a prostanoid TP receptor agonist)-induced inhibition of noradrenaline release from the stomach was reduced by U-73122 [1-[6-[[(17beta)-3-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-trien-17-yl]-amino]hexyl]-1H-pyrrole-2,5-dine] (a PLC inhibitor) and ET-18-OCH(3) (1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine) (a phosphatidylinositol-specific PLC inhibitor), respectively. 2-APB (2-aminoethyldiphenyl borate) (a putative IP(3) receptor antagonist) also abolished the U-46619-induced inhibition of noradrenaline release, but Ro 31-8220 [2-{1-[3-(amidinothio)propyl]-1H-indol-3-yl}-3-(1-methylindol-3-yl)-maleimide] (a protein kinase C inhibitor) had no effect. Furthermore, a small dose of tetraethylammonium and charybdotoxin [blockers of BK type Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel] abolished the U-46619-induced inhibition, but apamin (a blocker of SK-type Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel) had no effect. These results suggest that BK type Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channels are involved in prostanoid TP receptor-mediated inhibition of electrically evoked noradrenaline release from the gastric sympathetic nerve terminals in rats.

Systematic underestimation of oxygen delivery in ventilated preterm infants. Emerging evidence indicates that hyperoxia is a risk factor for bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a common multifactorial long-term complication of prematurity. To date, the equivalence between set and delivered oxygen (O(2)) in ventilated preterm infants has not been rigorously studied. To test the hypothesis of systematic underestimation of O(2) delivery in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants during long-term ventilation. Actually achieved O(2) concentrations were measured and compared to the set inspired oxygen fraction (FiO(2)). A total of 108 O(2) measurements were carried out during the ventilation of 54 ELBW infants: O(2)-Delta error (i.e., the difference between O(2) concentrations achieved by the ventilator and set FiO(2)) was the main study outcome measure. Systematic O(2)-Delta errors were found, with mean values of +9.52% (FiO(2) 0.21-0.40), +2.10 (FiO(2) 0.41-0.60), +2.86% (FiO(2) 0.61-0.80), and +0.016% (FiO(2) 0.81-1.0; p < 0.0001). Theoretical simulations from the observed data indicate that, if not corrected, systematic O2-Delta errors would lead to a non-intentional total O(2) load of 1,202.9 (FiO(2) 0.21-0.40), 252.46 (FiO(2) 0.41-0.60), 342.85 (FiO(2) 0.61-0.80), and 2 (FiO(2) 0.81-1.0) extra liters/kg body weight/100 ventilation hours. Systematic underestimation of the O(2) delivered by infant ventilators can potentially lead to surprisingly large increases in total O(2) load during long-term ventilation of ELBW infants, especially in the lower FiO(2) range (i.e., 0.21-0.40). Underestimation of true O(2) delivery can potentially lead to unrecognized high O(2) loads, and more pronounced and prolonged hyperoxia.


Cytology versus HPV testing for the detection of high-grade cervical lesions in women found positive on visual inspection in Mumbai, India.

The influence of left-ventricular shape on end-diastolic fiber stress and strain. Passive filling is a major determinant for the pump performance of the left ventricle and is determined by the filling pressure and the ventricular compliance. We quantified the influence of left-ventricular shape on the overall compliance and the distribution of passive fiber stress and strain during the filling period in normal myocardium. Hereto, fiber stress and strain were calculated in a finite element analysis during the inflation of left ventricles of different shape, ranging from an elongated ellipsoid to a sphere, but keeping the initial cavity and wall volume constant. The passive myocardium was described by an incompressible hyperelastic material law with transverse isotropic symmetry along the muscle fiber directions. A realistic transmural gradient in fiber orientation was assumed. While compliance was not altered, the transmural distribution of both passive fiber stress and strain was highly dependent on ventricular shape, where more spherical ventricles exhibited a higher subendocardial gradient in both quantities.

Impact of statin use on survival in patients undergoing resection for early-stage pancreatic cancer. It has been suggested that statins exert potential anti-tumor effects. The relationship between statin use and outcomes in pancreatic cancer is controversial. We hypothesized that statin use at baseline would impact survival among patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer and that the effect might vary by individual statin agent. We conducted a retrospective cohort study on data from an integrated healthcare system. We included patients with pancreatic cancer stage I-IIb who underwent resection for curative intent between January 2005 and January 2011. Baseline statin use was characterized as any prior use as well as active use of either simvastatin or lovastatin. Intensity of exposure was calculated as average daily dose prior to surgery. Overall and disease-free survival was assessed from surgery until the end of study (April 2014). We used the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate the impact of baseline statin use on survival, adjusting for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity score, resection margin, disease stage, and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy. Among 226 patients, 71 (31.4%) had prior simvastatin use and 27 (11.9%) had prior lovastatin use at baseline. Prior simvastatin but not lovastatin use was associated with improved survival (median 28.5 months (95% confidence limit (CL) 20.8, 38.4) for simvastatin vs. 12.9 months (9.6, 15.5) for lovastatin vs. 16.5 months (14.1, 18.9) for non-statin users; log-rank P=0.0035). In Cox regression, active simvastatin use was independently associated with reduced risk for mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.56 (95% CL 0.38, 0.83), P=0.004) and risk for recurrence (adjusted HR 0.61 (0.41, 0.89), P=0.01). Survival improved significantly among patients who received moderate-high-intensity (median 42.1 months (24.0,52.7)) doses compared with those who received low-intensity doses of simvastatin (median 14.1 months (8.6, 23.8), log-rank P=0.03). The effects of statins varied by agent and dose. Active use of moderate-high-dose simvastatin at baseline was associated with improved overall and disease-free survival among patients undergoing resection for pancreatic cancer.


Biomaterial considerations for drug-eluting stents.

Can biofeedback training of psychophysiological responses enhance athletes' sport performance? A practitioner's perspective. In recent years, biofeedback has become increasingly popular for its proven success in peak performance training - the psychophysiological preparation of athletes for high-stakes sport competitions, such as the Olympic games. The aim of this research was to test whether an 8-week period of exposure to biofeedback training could improve the psychophysiological control over competitive anxiety and enhance athletic performance in participating subjects. Participants of this study were highly competent athletes, each training in different sport disciplines. The experimental group consisted of 18 athletes (4 women, 14 men), whereas the Control group had 21 athletes (4 women, 17 men). All athletes were between 16 and 34 years old. The biofeedback device, Nexus 10, was used to detect and measure the psychophysiological responses of athletes. Athletes from both groups (control and experimental) were subjected to stress tests at the beginning of the study and once again at its conclusion. In between, the experimental group received training in biofeedback techniques. We then calculated the overall percentage of athletes in the experimental group compared with those in the control group who were able to control respiration, skin conductance, heart rate, blood flow amplitude, heart rate variability, and heart respiration coherence. One year following completion of the initial study, we questioned athletes from the experimental group, to determine whether they continued to use these skills and if they could detect any subsequent enhancement in their athletic performance. We demonstrated that a greater number of participants in the experimental group were able to successfully control their psychophysiological parameters, in comparison to their peers in the control group. Significant results (p < 0.05) were noted in regulation of GSR following short stress test conditions (p = 0.037), in regulation of HR after exposure to STROOP stressor (p = 0.037), in regulation of GSR following the Math and GSR stressors (p = 0.033, p = 0.409) and in achieving HR - breathing coherence following the math stressor (p = 0.042). One year following completion of the training program, all participants from the experimental group indicated that they were still using the biofeedback - psycho-regulation skills. Furthermore, these participants uniformly reported believing that these skills had enhanced their athletic performance and general well-being.

Correlation between sensory evaluation scores of Japanese sake and metabolome profiles. The aim of this study was to explore the association between taste and metabolite profiles of Japanese refined sake. Nontarget metabolome analysis was conducted using capillary electrophoresis mass spectrometry. Zatsumi, an unpleasant not clear flavor, and sweetness, bitterness, and sourness were graded by four experienced panelists. Regression models based on support vector regression (SVR) were used to estimate the relationships among sensory evaluation scores and quantified metabolites and visualized as a nonlinear relationship between sensory scores and metabolite components. The SVR model was highly accurate and versatile: the correlation coefficients for whole training data, cross-validation, and separated validation data were 0.86, 0.73, and 0.73, respectively, for zatsumi. Other sensory scores were also analyzed and modeled by SVR. The methodology demonstrated here carries great potential for predicting the relevant parameters and quantitative relationships between charged metabolites and sensory evaluation in Japanese refined sake.

Dislocation and bicruciate lesions of the knee: epidemiology and acute stage assessment in a prospective series. Knee dislocation and bicruciate lesions are rare. Assessments of results from retrospective series carry an insufficient level of evidence. A prospective multicenter study was therefore set up, under the auspices of the French Society of Orthopedic Surgery. The inclusion period covered the whole of 2007. Clinical, imaging (dynamic X-ray and MRI) and vascular (angioscan and arteriography) assessment was performed systematically. In patients over the age of 60 years, ligament lesions were always managed non-surgically; in those under the age of 60 years, surgery was considered in the absence of associated vascular lesion or open dislocation and if there was frontal laxity exceeding 15 degrees or a posterior drawer test greater than 10mm. The posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) and peripheral ligament tears were repaired or reinforced under arthroscopy or by arthrotomy. The anterior cruciate ligament was never operated on. In all other cases, management was conservative. Sixty-seven knees were included (55 male, 11 female; mean age: 37 years). Fifteen patients (25.4%) had bicruciate lesion, and 44 (74.6%) knee dislocation. Mean trauma-to-reduction interval was 3 hrs 50 min. Only one of the nine cases of popliteal artery lesion exhibited discernible distal pulse wave. Only three of these patients underwent vascular surgical repair. Twelve knees (five bicruciate lesions, seven dislocations) had isolated common peroneal nerve damage. This prospective study detailed the epidemiology and treatment of the lesions encountered, with the option of PCL and peripheral ligament reconstruction. The results, however, still require long-term analysis.

[Effect of iron overload on function of pancreatic beta cells in rats].

Effects of acute ethanol on beta-endorphin release in the nucleus accumbens of selectively bred lines of alcohol-preferring AA and alcohol-avoiding ANA rats. The selectively bred lines of alcohol-preferring alko alcohol (AA) and alcohol-avoiding alko nonalcohol (ANA) rats have been used to demonstrate differences in relevant neurotransmitters which could account for their difference in alcohol consumption. Studies have demonstrated differences in distinct components of the endogenous opioid system in various brain regions associated with the process of reinforcement between the AA and ANA lines of rats. The goal of this current study was to investigate the hypotheses that the AA and ANA rats will show differences in the release of beta-endorphin at the level of nucleus accumbens (NAC) and in locomotor activity in response to acute systemic administration of ethanol. AA and ANA rats were unilaterally implanted with a guide cannula to aim microdialysis probes at the level of NAC. Intraperitoneal injections of 0.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 g ethanol/kg body weight were administered. Dialysate samples were collected at 30-min intervals prior to and following the injection. Radioimmunoassay specific for beta-endorphin was used to determine the dialysate beta-endorphin content. The 2.5-g/kg ethanol dose induced a transient increase in extracellular beta-endorphin at the level of NAC of AA but not of ANA rats. The 2.5-g/kg ethanol dose also attenuated locomotor activity in the AA but not in the ANA rats. The lack of an increase in the beta-endorphin concentration in the NAC of ANA rats in response to ethanol may partially account for their lower alcohol consumption and lower alcohol-induced attenuation of locomotor activity compared to AA rats.

Navigated transcranial magnetic stimulation for preoperative functional diagnostics in brain tumor surgery. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a noninvasive method for analyzing cortical function. To utilize TMS for presurgical functional diagnostics, the magnetic impulse must be precisely targeted by stereotactically positioning the coil. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of TMS for operation planning when combined with a sensor-based electromagnetic navigation system (nTMS). Preoperative functional mapping with nTMS was performed in 10 patients with rolandic tumors. Intraoperative mapping was performed with the "gold standard" of direct cortical stimulation. Stimulation was performed in the same predefined 5-mm raster for both modalities, and the results were compared. In regard to the 5-mm mapping raster, the centers of gravity of nTMS and direct cortical stimulation were located at the same spot in 4 cases and at neighboring spots in the remaining 6 cases. The mean distance between the tumor and the nearest motor response ("safety margin") was 7.9 mm (range, 5-15 mm; standard deviation, 3.2 mm) for nTMS and 6.6 mm (range, 0-12 mm; standard deviation, 3.4 mm) for direct cortical stimulation. nTMS allowed for reliable, precise application of the magnetic impulse, and the peritumoral somatotopy corresponded well between the 2 modalities in all 10 cases. nTMS is a promising method for preoperative functional mapping in motor cortex tumor surgery.

Antioxidant defenses in the ocular surface. The human eye is subjected constantly to oxidative stress due to daily exposure to sunlight, high metabolic activities, and oxygen tension. Reactive oxygen species generated from environmental insults and pathological conditions render the human eye particularly vulnerable to oxidative damage. The ocular surface composed of the tear film, the cornea, and the aqueous humor forms the first physical and biochemical barrier of the eye and plays a pivotal role in combating free radicals. These ocular compartments are enriched in certain antioxidants in the form of metabolic enzymes or small molecules. Such an antioxidant defense system in the ocular surface is essential for the maintenance of redox homeostasis in the eye and protection against oxidative damage. Herein, we review the properties and functions of key constituent antioxidants of the ocular surface.

Effects of floc aluminum on activated sludge characteristics and removal of 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol in wastewater systems. The effects of floc aluminum (Al) on activated sludge performance and 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) removal were studied using bench-scale activated sludge systems. The results showed that higher Al-fed activated sludge led to better settling, dewatering, and effluent quality with better EE2 removal. EE2 concentrations in the effluent revealed correlations with effluent suspended solids and large particulate/colloidal effluent biopolymer (protein+polysaccharide). Furthermore, a significant correlation existed between effluent proteins and EE2 for all size fractions, indicating that hydrophobic proteinaceous colloids provide binding sites for EE2 and washout together into the effluent. These results suggest that aluminum plays a crucial role in bioflocculation of activated sludge and the efficacy of flocculation influences the removal of endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs) from wastewater treatment systems.

Regulation of amygdalar PKA by beta-arrestin-2/phosphodiesterase-4 complex is critical for fear conditioning. Beta-arrestins, key regulators of receptor signaling, are highly expressed in the central nervous system, but their roles in brain physiology are largely unknown. Here we show that beta-arrestin-2 is critically involved in the formation of associative fear memory and amygdalar synaptic plasticity. In response to fear conditioning, beta-arrestin-2 translocates to amygdalar membrane where it interacts with PDE-4, a cAMP-degrading enzyme, to inhibit PKA activation. Arrb2(-/-) mice exhibit impaired conditioned fear memory and long-term potentiation at the lateral amygdalar synapses. Moreover, expression of the beta-arrestin-2 in the lateral amygdala of Arrb2(-/-) mice, but not its mutant form that is incapable of binding PDE-4, restores basal PKA activity and rescues conditioned fear memory. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the feedback regulation of amygdalar PKA activation by beta-arrestin-2 and PDE-4 complex is critical for the formation of conditioned fear memory.

High plasma levels of adipocytokines are associated with platelet activation in patients with coronary artery disease. Previous studies suggested that the adipocytokines, adiponectin and leptin, are associated with the progression and prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD). The aim of this study was to differentially evaluate plasma levels of adiponectin and leptin in patients with CAD and their association with conventional laboratory parameters and markers of platelet activation. We consecutively evaluated 220 patients, who presented with a symptomatic CAD. Among these 83 (37.7%) presented with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 137 (62.3%) with a stable angina pectoris (SAP). All patients have received coronary angiography. Baseline concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Lower detection limits of the assay were 0.079 ng/mL for total adiponectin and 15.6 pg/mL for leptin. Patients with ACS showed significantly enhanced plasma levels of adiponectin and leptin compared with SAP (ACS vs. SAP (mean +/- SD): adiponectin: 9.9 +/- 7.6 microg/mL vs. 7.2 +/- 5.7 microg/mL; P = 0.008; leptin: 20.9 +/- 16.4 ng/mL vs. 15.2 +/- 10.9 ng/mL; P = 0.012). However, a correlation between plasma total adiponectin and leptin levels has not been observed (r = 0.038; P = 0.706). Plasma levels of total adiponectin and leptin positively correlated with C-reactive protein (adiponectin: r = 0.277; P = 0.001; leptin: r = 0.248; P = 0.007) and troponin-I (adiponectin: r = 0.219; P = 0.001; leptin: r = 0.190; P = 0.025). Plasma levels of both adipocytokines have shown an inverse correlation with markers of platelet activation such as platelet glycoprotein VI (adiponectin: r = -0.120; P = 0.048; leptin:r = -0.205; P = 0.036), and in a negative trend with P-selectin (adiponectin: r = -0.116; P = 0.073; leptin: r = -0.172; P = 0.078). To support our findings, we determined high-molecular-weight adiponectin in a subgroup of 37 patients, which showed similar results. Increased concentrations of total adiponectin and leptin were associated with ACS. Intriguingly, high plasma levels of both adipocytokines seem to modulate platelet activation. Further studies should elucidate the adipocytokine regulation in CAD.

The association between internet addiction and self-injurious behaviour among adolescents. To examine the association between internet addiction and self-injurious behaviour (SIB) in adolescence. Population-based cross-sectional survey of 1618 high school students aged 13-18 years in Guangzhou city, Guangdong Province, PR China. Deliberate SIB was measured using self-reported questionnaire; internet addiction was assessed using the Internet Addiction Test (IAT). 263 (16.3%) participants reported having committed some form of SIB in the past 6 months. 73 (4.5%) had committed SIB 6 times or more, and 157 (9.7%) 1-5 times. The majority of respondents were classified as normal users of the internet (n = 1392, 89.2%), with 158 (10.2%) moderately and 10 (0.6%) severely addicted to the internet. After adjusting for potential confounders, the odds ratio for SIB was 2.0 (95% CI 1.1 to 3.7) for those who were classified as moderately and severely addicted to the internet when compared to the normal group. SIB is common in adolescence in the study population in China. Addiction to the internet is detrimental to mental health and increases the risk of self-injury among adolescents. Clinicians need to be aware of potential co-morbidities of other addictions among adolescent self-injured patients.

Operation Access: a proven model for providing volunteer surgical services to the uninsured in the United States. Numerous studies have shown that patients without insurance lack coordinated health care and access to surgical procedures. Operation Access (OA) has coordinated uncompensated, low-risk outpatient surgical and specialty services to the uninsured in a volunteer setting for 15 years. Our objective was to evaluate the quality of outpatient surgical care provided by OA volunteers. Retrospective cohort study using data from OA's secure database to evaluate the quality of care provided to all patients eligible for OA services from 1994 through 2008. Primary outcomes included quality of care as measured by the Institute of Medicine's six quality aims, ie, safety, efficiency, effectiveness, timeliness, patient-centered care, and equity. Six-thousand five-hundred and forty-two patients were referred to OA during the past 15 years; 83.4% met eligibility criteria. Of these, 3,518 unduplicated patients received 3,098 surgical, endoscopic, and minor procedures. Only 12 of 1,880 surgical patients experienced a complication requiring hospitalization. Patient care was efficient, with a 95.3% overall compliance rate; approximately $7.56 of services were provided for every dollar of philanthropic support. OA's strong emphasis on case management, focus on continuity of care, and patient-selection criteria contributed to the organization's provision of safe, efficient, effective, timely, and patient-centered care. A higher percentage of Latinos and a lower percentage of African Americans relative to the geographic demographics received OA services. A volunteer program providing low-risk outpatient operations using the OA model delivers safe, efficient, effective, timely, and patient-centered care.

Joint treatment of landfill leachate with municipal wastewater by submerged membrane bioreactor. Young leachate was a high strength wastewater with regard to carbon and nitrogen matter, and up to now many researchers have focused on a number of treatment methods to treat the leachate. By using various treatment processes, joint treatment of leachate with domestic wastewater, resulted from same community, is one of the most significant methods because domestic wastewater has either larger mass or lower strength than leachate. In this study, a submerged membrane bioreactor (sMBR) was used for treatment of blending wastewater, including differential mixture ratios of domestic wastewater and leachate. In raw leachate, BOD(5)/COD was between 0.40 and 0.67 and total phosphorus was between 17 and 24 mg/l. After the leachate was blended with domestic wastewater in the ratios of 1/5-1/20, the influent COD decreased from 8,500-14,200 mg/l to 750-2,400 mg/l as ammonium decreased from 1,100-2,150 mg/l to 30-180 mg/l. The sMBR, which was aerated intermittently, accomplished both COD oxidation and nutrient removal at optimal conditions without adding the external phosphorus source, providing < 15 mg COD/l, <1.3 mg NH(4) (+)-N/l, and <2.0 mg P/l on average at solid retention times (SRT) higher than 10 days. Consequently, the results showed the mixture of leachate and domestic wastewater could be an acceptable alternative by means of membrane bioreactor technology.

Early outcomes using alemtuzumab induction in lung transplantation. Immunosuppressive regimens for lung transplantation frequently fail to prevent rejection and are toxic. Alemtuzumab was used as induction to investigate whether oral immunosuppression could be reduced. From November 2006 to March 2008, 20 consecutive lung transplant patients received alemtuzumab induction, with reduced maintenance immunosuppression; tacrolimus (target level 10 ng/ml), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 250 mg bid and prednisone 7.5 mg. Twenty control cases transplanted before 2006 were treated with standard immunosuppression; tacrolimus (target level 10 ng/ml), MMF 750 mg bid and prednisone 15 mg qd. End-points included patient and graft survival, acute rejection (AR) and infection rate. There were no significant differences in six-month and 12-month survival (alemtuzumab 90% vs. controls 95%, P=0.52 and 76% vs. 95%, respectively, P=0.19). AR events were similar (alemtuzumab 2/16 vs. controls 5/20, P=0.43) - as were - bacteria positive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures (alemtuzumab 4.9+/-7.3 per patient per year vs. controls 2.7+/-3.3, P=0.26) and viral or fungal infections (alemtuzumab 0.4+/-1.4 per patient per year vs. controls 0.1+/-0.3, P=0.87; alemtuzumab 3.9+/-6.6 vs. controls 2.3+/-1.9, P=0.57, respectively). Alemtuzumab induction and reduced immunosuppression appears to offer comparable early survival, rejection and infection rates to high-dose standard immunosuppression.

[Influence of genetic factors on human sexual orientation. Review]. Human sexual orientation is a complex trait, influenced by several genes, experiential and sociocultural factors. These elements interact and produce a typical pattern of sexual orientation towards the opposite sex. Some exceptions exist, like bisexuality and homosexuality, which seem to be more frequent in males than females. Traditional methods for the genetic study of behavior multifactorial characteristics consist in detecting the presence of familial aggregation. In order to identify the importance of genetic and environmental factors in this aggregation, the concordance of the trait for monozygotic and dizygotic twins and for adopted sibs, reared together and apart, is compared. These types of studies have shown that familial aggregation is stronger for male than for female homosexuality. Based on the threshold method for multifactorial traits, and varying the frequency of homosexuality in the population between 4 and 10%, heritability estimates between 0.27 and 0.76 have been obtained. In 1993, linkage between homosexuality and chromosomal region Xq28 based on molecular approaches was reported. Nevertheless, this was not confirmed in later studies. Recently, a wide search of the genome has given significant or close to significant linkage values with regions 7q36, 8p12 and 10q26, which need to be studied more closely. Deviation in the proportion of X chromosome inactivation in mothers of homosexuals seems to favor the presence of genes related with sexual orientation in this chromosome. There is still much to be known about the genetics of human homosexuality.


Pitfalls in appendicitis.

An experimental evaluation of diffusion tensor image segmentation using graph-cuts. The segmentation of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data is a challenging problem due to the high variation and overlap of the distributions induced by individual DTI measures (e.g., fractional anisotropy). Accurate tissue segmentation from DTI data is important for characterizing the mi-crostructural properties of white matter (WM) in a subsequent analysis. This step may also be useful for generating a mask to constrain the results of WM tractography. In this study, a graph-cuts segmentation method was applied to the problem of extracting WM, gray matter (GM) and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) from brain DTI data. A two-phase segmentation method was adopted by first segmenting CSF signal from the DTI data using the third eigenvalue (lambda(3)) maps, and then extracting WM regions from the fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. The algorithm was evaluated on ten real DTI data sets obtained from in vivo human brains and the results were compared against manual segmentation by an expert. Overall, the graph cuts method performed well, giving an average segmentation accuracy of about 0.90, 0.77 and 0.88 for WM, GM and CSF respectively in terms of volume overlap(VO).

Self-assembled nanoparticle drug delivery systems from galactosylated polysaccharide-doxorubicin conjugate loaded doxorubicin. Xyloglucan was grafted with the doxorubicin (DOX) and galactosamine, a terminal moiety that can be used to target polymeric conjugates to liver hepatocytes. The content of the DOX was over 5% (wt) in the conjugate. The polymeric drug assisted to form nanoparticle drug delivery systems (nanoDDSs) with an average size of 142 nm in diameter when combined with an excess amount of deprotonated doxorubicin in an aqueous phase. A loading content of doxorubicin is as high as 23.8% in the nanoDDS. In an in vitro cytotoxicity experiment, the novel nanoDDS has similar cytotoxicity as free DOX against HepG2 cells. In contrast, for the incubation with HeLa cells of the novel nanoDDS, there was no significant cytotoxicity change. In a human tumor xenograft nude mouse model, the novel nanoDDS generated higher therapeutic effect than non-targeted doxorubicin nanoparticles or free doxorubicin. Together, these results suggest that novel nanoDDS, which has improved transfection efficiency and hepatocyte specificity, may be useful for tumor therapy.

Quality-of-life technology for people with spinal cord injuries. Technology plays a critical role in promoting well-being, activity, and participation for individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI). As technology has improved, so has the realm of possibilities open to people with SCI. School, work, travel, and leisure activities are all facilitated by technology. Advances in materials have made wheelchairs lighter, and developments in design have made wheelchairs that fit individual needs. Software has made computer interfaces adaptive and in some case intelligent, through learning the user's behavior and optimizing its structure. As participatory action design and aware systems take greater hold, transformational change is likely to take place in the technology available to people with SCI.

Optic Disc Ovality in Primary School Children in Beijing. The purpose of this study was to assess the ovality of the optic disc and its associations with myopia-related factors in primary school children in Beijing. This longitudinal school-based study included 382 grade 1 children and 299 grade 4 children who were followed for 2 years. Study participants underwent a comprehensive eye examination including autorefractometry, ocular biometry, and fundus photography. Fundus photographs were available for 562 children (82.5%). The mean optic disc ovality (maximal-to-minimal disc diameter) was 1.17 Â± 0.29 (range, 1.00-1.50). Oval discs defined by an ovality of â¥ 1.33 were detected in 37 children (prevalence: 6.6%; 95% confidence interval: 4.5-8.6). In multivariate linear regression analysis, higher optic disc ovality index was significantly associated with older age (P = 0.001), female sex (P = 0.005), larger parapapillary beta zone (P < 0.001), and shorter time spent indoors with studying (P = 0.003) and was marginally significant (P = 0.057), with greater increase in myopic refractive error from 2011 to 2013. From 2011 to 2013, myopic refractive error increased in the oval optic disc group by 1.03 Â± 0.99 diopters compared to 0.67 Â± 1.31 diopters in the nonoval disc group. The prevalence of oval optic discs in Beijing school children was markedly higher than in the elderly Beijing Eye Study population (6.6% vs. 0.36%), paralleling the higher prevalence of myopia in school children. The association between oval optic discs and less time spent indoors with studying after adjusting for longitudinal change in myopic refractive error, age, sex and parapapillary beta zone may warrant further exploration of external factors associated with oval optic discs.

Detection of Dientamoeba fragilis in Portuguese children with acute gastroenteritis between 2011 and 2013. Dientamoeba fragilis is an inhabitant of human gastrointestinal tract with a worldwide distribution. The first description considered this protozoan a rare and harmless commensal, since then it has struggled to gain recognition as a pathogen. Commercial multiplex real-time PCR was used to detect D. fragilis in fecal samples from hospitalized children (â©½18 years) with acute gastrointestinal disease, admitted to two hospitals of Lisbon area, with different demographic characteristics. A total of 176 children were studied, 103 (58Â·5%) male, 144 (81Â·8%) children between 0 and 5 years and 32 (18Â·2%) above 6 years old. The overall protozoa frequency considering the four tested microorganisms were 8Â·5% (15/176), and the most frequently found protozoan was D. fragilis, 6Â·3% (11/176). Dientamoeba fragilis frequency was higher among older children (21Â·9%), than younger children (2Â·8%), and greater in boys (6Â·8%) than in girls (5Â·5%). All positive children presented with diarrhoea associated with vomiting, fever and abdominal pain. Infection was associated with the age of children (P < 0Â·001), school attendance (P = 0Â·002) and consumption of certain foods (P = 0Â·014), e.g. cakes with crÃ¨me and ham. The frequency of diantamoebiasis found in a cohort of hospitalized Portuguese children, with acute gastrointestinal disease, could be considered a very high value when compared with the protozoan frequency normally associated with this pathology. 


Ageing in animal populations--an epidemiological perspective.

Endocrine complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation during childhood and adolescence. Long-term survivors of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) during childhood and adolescence are at risk of developing endocrine complications. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term endocrine complications and their associated risk factors among such patients. We reviewed the data from 111 patients (59 males and 52 females) who underwent HSCT at the mean age of 8.3+/-4.1 yr. Thirty patients (27.0%) had growth impairment, and seven (21.2%) out of 33 patients who attained final height reached final height below 2 standard deviation (SD). The final height SD score of the patients conditioned with total body irradiation (TBI) was significantly lower than that of the patients conditioned without TBI (-1.18+/-1.14 vs. -0.19+/-0.78, P=0.011). Thirteen patients (11.7%) developed hypothyroidism (11 subclinical, 2 central) 3.8+/-1.8 (range 1.6-6.2) yr after HSCT. Nineteen (65.5%) out of 29 females had evidence of gonadal dysfunction, and 18 (64.3%) out of 28 males had evidence of gonadal dysfunction. The risk for gonadal dysfunction was significantly higher in females conditioned with busulfan/cyclophosphamide (P=0.003). These results suggest that the majority of patients treated with HSCT during childhood and adolescence have one or more endocrine complications. Therefore, multiple endocrine functions should be monitored periodically after HSCT until they reach adult age.

[The association of VACÂ® therapy, titanium plates osteosynthesis and bilateral pectoral muscle flaps in the management of postoperative mediastinitis in an obese and diabetic patient]. Postoperative mediastinitis is one of the most worrisome complications after heart surgery. Until now there is no universally accepted strategy in the management of this infectious complication. Recently, various novel techniques like negative pressure therapy and titanium plates sternal reconstruction have allowed a dramatic decrease of mortality and morbidity after mediastinitis. We report the case of a diabetic patient suffering from morbid obesity who developed a severe postoperative mediastinitis after a coronary artery bypass; she was successfully treated by combining negative pressure therapy, titanium plates osteosynthesis and bilateral pectoral muscle flaps.

Detection of differentially expressed basal cell proteins by mass spectrometry. The ability of cells to modulate interactions with each other and the substrate is essential for epithelial tissue remodeling during processes such as wound healing and tumor progression. However, despite strides made in the field of proteomics, proteins involved in adhesion have been difficult to study. Here, we report a method for the enrichment and analysis of proteins associated with the basal surface of the cell and its underlying matrix. The enrichment involves deroofing the cells with 20 mM ammonium hydroxide and the removal of cytosolic and organellar proteins by stringent water wash. Proteomic profiling was achieved by LC-FTMS, which allowed comparison of differentially expressed or shared proteins under different cell states. First, we analyzed and compared the basal cell components of mouse keratinocytes lacking the cell-cell junction molecule plakoglobin with their control counterparts. Changes in the molecules involved in motility and invasion were detected in plakoglobin-deficient cells, including decreased detection of fibronectin, integrin beta(4), and FAT tumor suppressor. Second, we assessed the differences in basal cell components between two human oral squamous cell carcinoma lines originating from different sites in the oral cavity (CAL33 and UM-SCC-1). The data show differences between the two lines in the type and abundance of proteins specific to cell adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis. Therefore, the method described here has the potential to serve as a platform to assess proteomic changes in basal cell components including extracellular and adhesion-specific proteins involved in wound healing, cancer, and chronic and acquired adhesion-related disorders.

The role of sexuality in sadism: object relations and drive theory perspectives. The sexual components of sadism are conceptualized within the contexts of different forms of sadism. In aggression-drive sadism, sexuality is seen as a generalization of instinctual reactivity. Parallels are presented of such spillover between aggression and anxiety and even between aggression and oral impulses, with the notion that any areas of excitation or partial impulses can be energized by the acute release of energy in another domain. Another dynamic is presented for re-enactment sadists, in which the sexuality has a relational meaning. In such cases, sexuality is intertwined with the aggression, as the sadistic ritual actually re-evokes an original trauma that features these elements. It is further agued that the sexuality in these two sadistic modes is not consistent. The instinctual spillover that occurs in hostile psychopathy is psychosexually rooted in phallic functioning, in which relational implications are absent, while the sexuality in re-enacted sadism is genitally based, and is intrinsically linked to an imagined emotional relationship with the victim that is intended to ameliorate and undo past trauma that haunt the perpetrator.

Identification of cellular partners of Influenza A virus (H5N1) non-structural protein NS1 by yeast two-hybrid system. Influenza A virus (IAV) subtype H5N1 is associated with the re-emergence of severe human influenza. The virus is highly virulent and viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1) is believed to play a crucial role in the viral pathogenesis. A screening for human proteins interacting with NS1 was performed by a yeast two-hybrid system (Y2H). Two bait plasmids that expressed DNA binding domain (BD) fused to either RNA binding domain or to effector domain of NS1 were constructed and transformed into yeast. The bait yeast was mated with a prey yeast containing human macrophage cDNA library fused to DNA activation domain. Obtained clones were interacting with interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), MHC class I HLA-B, cathepsin B, ubiquitin, and adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR1). These proteins play important role in the immune response, targeting for proteosomal degradation, and RNA editing. Thus, IAV H5N1 may use NS1 to manipulate these host proteins for its own benefit and in that way confer an unusual severity to the infection.

[A new combination therapy for diabetic gastroparesis]. According to our knowledge and for the first time we refer about the combination therapy with gastric electric stimulation and injection of botulinus toxin into the pylorus at a patient with increased symptomatic diabetic gastroparesis for the first time. The prospectively documented gastroparesis-symptom-score improved dramatically under this combination therapy, while time of gastric emptying of 50 % (specified by scintigraphy) was showing solely a low decrease. 18 months after beginning the combination therapy its positive effect is to be watched furthermore, complications haven't occurred yet. The combination therapy with gastric electric stimulation and injection of botulinus toxin into the pylorus demonstrates one option of therapy-refractory diabetic gastroparesis, which has to be verified, however, in prospective studies in terms of its effectiveness.


A comparative study of two acoustic measures of hypernasality.

Association between raised inflammatory markers and cognitive decline in elderly people with type 2 diabetes: the Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study. To determine whether circulating levels of the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha are associated with cognitive ability and estimated lifetime cognitive decline in an elderly population with type 2 diabetes. A cross-sectional study of 1,066 men and women aged 60-75 years with type 2 diabetes and living in Lothian, Scotland (the Edinburgh Type 2 Diabetes Study), was performed. Seven cognitive tests were used to measure abilities in memory, nonverbal reasoning, information processing speed, executive function, and mental flexibility. The results were used to derive a general intelligence factor (g). A vocabulary-based test was administered as an estimate of peak prior cognitive ability. Results on the cognitive tests were assessed for statistical association with inflammatory markers measured in a venous blood sample at the time of cognitive testing. Higher IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels were associated with poorer age- and sex-adjusted scores on the majority of the individual cognitive tests. They were also associated with g using standardized regression coefficients -0.074 to -0.173 (P < 0.05). After adjusting for vocabulary, education level, cardiovascular dysfunction, duration of diabetes, and glycemic control, IL-6 remained associated with three of the cognitive tests and with g. In this representative population of people with type 2 diabetes, elevated circulating levels of inflammatory markers were associated with poorer cognitive ability. IL-6 levels were also associated with estimated lifetime cognitive decline.

Pilot Study Evaluating Efficacy of 2 Regimens for Hypovitaminosis D Repletion in Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Vitamin D is critical for skeletal health; hypovitaminosis D is common in pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), yet optimal repletion therapy is not well studied. We aimed to conduct a pilot trial comparing the efficacy of 2 vitamin D regimens of weekly dosing for the repletion of hypovitaminosis D in pediatric IBD. Subjects identified from our IBD clinic with 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations <30 ng/mL were randomized to 10,000 (nâ=â18) or 5000 (nâ=â14) IU of oral vitamin D3/10 kg body weight per week for 6 weeks. Serum 25(OH)D, Ca, and parathyroid hormone concentrations were measured at baseline, week 8, and week 12. In the higher dosing group, serum 25(OH)D increased from 23.7âÂ±â8.5 ng/mL at baseline to 49.2âÂ±â13.6 ng/mL at 8 weeks; Pâ<â0.001. In the lower dosing group, serum 25(OH)D increased from 24.0âÂ±â7.0 ng/mL at baseline to 41.5âÂ±â9.6 ng/mL at 8 weeks; Pâ<â0.001. At 12 weeks, serum 25(OH)D concentrations were 35.1âÂ±â8.4 and 30.8âÂ±â4.2 ng/mL for the higher and lower dose regimens, respectively. Mean serum Ca and parathyroid hormone concentrations did not significantly change during the study. No patient exhibited hypercalcemia, and no serious adverse events occurred. Both treatment arms were safe and effective at normalizing vitamin D nutriture in pediatric IBD. Although significant repletion of 25(OH)D concentration was achieved in both dosing groups at 8 weeks, this effect was lost by the 12-week follow-up. Maintenance vitamin D therapy following initial repletion is likely required to maintain long-term normalized vitamin D status.

Design parameters and sensitivity analysis of polymer-cladded porous silicon waveguides for small molecule detection. The relationship between the design parameters and small molecule detection sensitivity of porous silicon waveguides is theoretically and experimentally analyzed. Perturbation theory calculations suggest that the sensitivity asymptotically approaches infinity as the porosity of the waveguide approaches a critical porosity for a given mode and the resonant coupling angle of light into the waveguide approaches 90 degrees. Experimental measurements confirm the trend of the porosity-dependent sensitivity for multiple waveguide modes. Given the limitations of the available measurement apparatus that restricts the maximum coupling angle to 68 degrees, a high sensitivity of 120 degrees/RIU was demonstrated for the detection of 0.8 nm molecules attached inside a polymer-cladded nanoscale porous silicon waveguide. Optimized porous dielectric waveguides enable enhanced small molecule detection sensitivity due to their large available surface area for molecular binding.

Percutaneous closure of perimembranous ventricular septal defect with an Amplatzer Duct Occluder in a dextrocardia patient. In this article we report an unusual case of dextrocardia patient with perimembranous ventricular septal defect (VSD) whose defect is closed by percutaneous method with Amplatzer Duct Occluder-II device. To our best knowledge, this was the first time this device has been used to close a membranous defect in a patient with dextrocardia. Our case demonstrates the feasibility of percutaneous VSD closure in challenging patients by using appropiate techniques and devices for particular patients.


Exercise training as a treatment for chronic inflammation in the elderly.

Frequent aberrant methylation of the imprinted IGF2/H19 locus and LINE1 hypomethylation in ovarian carcinoma. Epigenetic alteration of tumor-related genes through changes of DNA methylation is a hallmark for carcinogenesis and aberrant DNA methylation modulates the activity of tumor suppressor genes, imprinted genes and repetitive elements. In ovarian carcinoma, frequent loss of imprinting or aberrant methylation of repetitive elements were reported, however, combined analysis were not performed. We analyzed the aberrant methylation of a differentially methylated region (DMR0) and a CTCF binding site of the IGF2-H19 locus and methylation of LINE1 and Satellite 2 in 22 primary ovarian carcinomas (OC) and controls by a quantitative bisulfite restriction analysis (QUBRA). In 91% of OC, a significant hypomethylation of DMR0 was found compared to controls (p<0.05). In 77% of OC, a hypermethylation of a CTCF binding site was found (p<0.05). A combined hypomethylation of DMR0 and hypermethylation of the CTCF binding was observed in 73% of OC. Hypomethylation of LINE1 and Satellite 2 was detected in 100 and 23% of OC, respectively. In summary, we found frequent combined aberrant methylation of the IGF2-H19 locus and LINE1 in the vast majority of OC, suggesting that these changes are important events in tumorigenesis.

Cow's milk protein allergy and other food hypersensitivities in infants. Food hypersensitivity (FHS) is the umbrella term used to describe both food allergy, which involves the immune system, and food intolerances, which do not. It is therefore important that the diagnosis is made by a specialist health care professional such as a paediatrician or allergist. Some experienced dietitians and health visitors may be able to assist in making a diagnosis. The diagnostic work-up includes a medical history and blood tests/skin tests (where applicable). A food and symptom diary followed by a special test diet to identify the foods causing the infant's symptoms may also be needed. Once a diagnosis is made, dietary advice should be given to eliminate or reduce the intake of the offending foods. For cow's milk hypersensitivity in infants, this will include choosing the most appropriate specialised infant formula.

Effects and action mechanism of Diospyros kaki on the differentiation of human leukemia HL-60 cells. Diospyros kaki Thunb. (Ebenaceae) is widely distributed in North-East Asian countries. Almost all parts of this plant have been traditionally used as medicine. Human promyelocytic leukemia cells differentiate into monocytes or granulocytes when treated with 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25-(OH)2D3] or all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA). Combination of low doses of ATRA or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 that do not induce toxicity with another drug is a useful strategy for acute promyelocytic leukemia therapy. Our main aim was to investigate the effect of an acetone extract of D. kaki leaves (KV-1) on HL-60 cell differentiation in combination of ATRA or 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Treatment of HL-60 cells with zero to 100 microg/ml of KV-1 for 72 h induced a small increase in cell differentiation. Surprisingly, a synergistic induction of differentiation was observed when the HL-60 cells were treated with ATRA or 1,25-(OH)2D3 and the extract. The inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC) (alpha and betaI) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), but not of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibited the HL-60 differentiation induced by the extract in combination of ATRA or 1,25-(OH)2D3, suggesting that PKC and ERK were involved in the cell differentiation enhancement by the extract. The results indicate that the acetone extract of D. kaki leaves has the ability to enhance HL-60 cell differentiation and suggest that it may be useful in acute promyelocytic leukemia therapy.

Amniotic fluid interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha at mid-trimester genetic amniocentesis: relationship to intra-amniotic microbial invasion and preterm delivery. To determine the value of amniotic fluid interleukin-6 (AF IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (AF TNF-alpha) in the diagnosis of microbial invasion of the amniotic cavity and in the prediction of preterm delivery (PTD). Following amniocentesis, a sample of amniotic fluid was sent for aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures along with Ureaplasma urealyticum culture and it was also assessed for IL-6 and TNF-alpha. Forty-eight women who delivered preterm (<37 weeks) were matched with 96 controls. The AF IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations of women with spontaneous PTD were significantly higher than those who delivered at term (IL-6: 176.3 pg/ml [130.6-208.6] vs. 52.3 pg/ml [37.2-92.3]; TNF-alpha: 8.8 pg/ml [7.2-10.7] vs. 5.5 pg/ml [5.0-6.3]). AF IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations of >99.3 pg/ml and of >6.6 pg/ml respectively, had a sensitivity of 89.6% and 81.3% and a specificity of 80.3% and 79.2% for the prediction of spontaneous PTD. Moreover, AF IL-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations of >99.3 pg/ml and of 6.3 pg/ml respectively, had a sensitivity of 91.9% and 78.4% and a specificity of 73.8% and 70.1% for the prediction of a positive AF culture. Elevated mid-trimester concentrations of AF IL-6, or/and of TNF-alpha can identify women at risk for intra-amniotic infection and for spontaneous PTD.

A two-equation coupled system model for determination of liver tissue temperature during radio frequency ablation. A model is presented that is an alternative approach to the bio-heat equation for use in radio frequency heating of the liver. The model comprises both a tissue subvolume and a blood subvolume. Separate bio-heat equations are determined for each subvolume, but with an additional term exchanging heat between them, thus creating a coupled system. The derivation for the two coupled differential equations is outlined and sample simulations are presented to demonstrate the importance of considering the two subvolumes separately, even when the blood subvolume is a small fraction of the tissue subvolume.

Fatigue and quality of life in pediatric multiple sclerosis. Fatigue and quality of life are significant concerns in adult multiple sclerosis (MS) but little is known about these factors in pediatric MS. The present investigation evaluates fatigue and quality of life in 51 pediatric MS patients to determine the rate of fatigue and reduced quality of life and assesses the relations between these variables and clinical factors. Fatigue and quality of life were assessed by self- and parent-report via the PedsQL Multidimensional Fatigue Scale and the PedsQL Quality of Life Scale. One-sample t-tests determined if scores were below published data for healthy individuals. Moreover, scores falling one standard deviation from norms were considered mildly affected, with severe difficulties being defined as scores falling two or more standard deviations from norms. Associations between self- and parent-reported difficulties and clinical factors were examined via Pearson correlation analyses. In comparison with healthy samples, pediatric MS patients reported greater difficulties with respect to fatigue, sleep, cognition, physical limitations, and academics. In addition to significant difficulties on these factors, parents reported problems with respect to emotional functioning, and tended to report greater fatigue, sleep, and cognitive difficulties than were self-reported. Expanded Disability Status Scale score was the only neurologic variable significantly related to fatigue or quality of life scores. Fatigue was significantly correlated with reports of sleep difficulties, cognitive problems, and quality of life variables. These findings suggest that fatigue and poorer quality of life is a clear concern in pediatric MS, and is related to overall physical disability.

[Expression and significance of elastin and fibulin-5 in anterior vaginal tissue of women with pelvic organ prolapse]. To investigate the expression and significance of elastin and fibulin-5 in anterior vaginal tissue of women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP). Between November 2006 and June 2008, 68 patients with POP underwent surgical treatment in Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University were enrolled in this study, who were classified into 10 patients with grade I, 21 patients with grade II, 25 patients with grade III and 12 patients with grade IV in accordance with pelvic organ prolapse quantitation (POP-Q). Meanwhile, 18 cases with early cervical cancer at stage of I b were treated by total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, their anterior vaginal tissues were selected as controls. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect the expression of elastin and fibulin-5. (1) Elastin and fibulin-5 were mainly expressed at extracellular matrix(ECM). (2) The positive rate of fibulin-5 expression in anterior vaginal wall were 5% (2/37) in grade III/IV and 26% (8/31) in grade I/IV POP patients, which reached statistical difference (P = 0.035). However, no statistical different expression was found between postmenopausal (13%, 8/60) and non-menopausal patients (2/8), vaginal delivery < or =2 (19%, 5/27) and >2 patients (12%, 5/41, P > 0.05). (3) The positive rate of elastin expression in anterior vaginal wall in POP group was 31% (21/68), which was significantly lower than 72% (13/18) of control group (P = 0.002). Among POP group, 19% (7/37) of elastin expression in grade III/IV POP was significantly lower than 45% (14/31) in grade I/II of POP patients. However, no statistical difference was found between postmenopausal (30%, 18/60) and non-menopausal patients (3/8), vaginal delivery < or =2 (26%, 7/27) and >2 patients(34%, 14/41, P > 0.05). (4) In POP group, both positive expression of fibulin-5 and elastin of anterior vaginal wall was in 6 cases, both negative expression of fibulin-5 and elastin was in 43 cases. It was illustrated that elastin and fibulin-5 had an positive relationship (P = 0.031). The decreased expression of elastin and fibulin-5 was correlated with degree of POP, which indicated that elastin and fibulin-5 may play a role in the pathogenesis of POP.

Upstream mechanotaxis behavior of endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial cell migration, which plays an important role in vascular remodeling, is known to be regulated by hemodynamic forces in the blood vessels. When shear stress is applied on mouse microvessel endothelial cells (bEnd.3) in vitro, cells exhibit upstream migration behavior with respect to the direction of the flow. To determine how shear stress magnitude influences mechanotaxis of the cells, endothelial cells were exposed to different magnitudes of unidirectional shear stress. While a higher flow rate reduces the speed of the motility, the horizontal component of the velocity parallel to the flow increases with the flow rate, indicating the higher alignment of cells in the direction parallel to the flow at a higher level of shear stress. In addition, cells seeded on softer substrate, whose elastic modulus is comparable to that of the blood vessels, show enhanced directional persistence when compared to those seeded on a stiffer substrate. The higher directionality accompanies increased stress fiber formation and focal adhesion turn-over, exhibiting higher mechanotaxis behavior. Therefore, the increased stiffness in the vessel may hinder the mechano-sensing mechanism of the endothelial cells, resulting in reduced mechanotaxis in response to hemodynamic shear stress. This substrate stiffness-dependent migration behavior can further elucidate the endothelial cell remodeling and wound healing in pathologically hardened vessels as well as re-endothelialization of vascular stents and grafted tissues.

Avoiding intelligence failures in the cardiac catheterization laboratory: Strategies for the safe and rational use of dalteparin or enoxaparin during percutaneous coronary intervention. Low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) has been a mainstay for the management of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) for almost a decade. However, several recent developments have seriously threatened the prominence of this drug class: (i) the adoption of an early invasive strategy, frequently leading to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) where the dosing and monitoring of LMWH is unfamiliar to most operators, (ii) the results of the SYNERGY trial, which not only failed to establish the superiority of enoxaparin over unfractionated heparin with respect to efficacy, but also demonstrated more bleeding with LMWH, and (iii) the results of the REPLACE-2 and ACUITY trials, which have demonstrated the advantages of an ACS and PCI treatment strategy based on direct thrombin inhibition with bivalirudin. To confront these challenges, cardiologists committed to the continued use of LMWH must develop safe and user-friendly approaches to transition patients from the noninvasive to invasive settings. This review summarizes an approach that takes advantage of the fact that LMWH can be readily monitored with the point-of-care activated clotting time (ACT) assay. This assay is inexpensive, available in virtually every catheterization laboratory, and familiar to most operators who monitor unfractionated heparin (UFH). A key concept that is presented is that the ACT is a more accurate measure of LMWH-induced anticoagulation than of UFH-induced anticoagulation. Our preliminary work suggests that during PCI operators should target an ACT of 175 seconds in the presence, and 200 seconds in the absence, of adjunctive glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibition. Sheath removal is recommended at an ACT < 160. These guidelines may facilitate continued use of LMWH, which has the potential to reduce cost (less expensive than bivalirudin), diminish the need for intravenous medication (can be administered subcutaneously in the noninvasive setting with minimal to no monitoring), and provide an ideal anticoagulant during PCI (easy to monitor with the ACT, at least partially reversible with protamine in the event of coronary perforation, effective antithrombin with no platelet activation, thereby potentially reducing the need for routine adjunctive IIb/IIIa inhibition).

Predicting the Agitation-Induced Aggregation of Monoclonal Antibodies Using Surface Tensiometry. Adsorption of antibody therapeutics to air-liquid interfaces can enhance aggregation, particularly when the solution does not contain protective surfactant or when the surfactant is diluted as occurs during preparation of intravenous infusion bags. The ability to predict an antibody's propensity for interfacially mediated aggregation is particularly useful during product development to ensure the quality, potency, and safety of the therapeutic. To develop a predictive tool, we investigated the surface pressure and surface excess of a panel of 16 antibodies as well as determined their aggregation propensity at the air-liquid interface in an agitation stress model. Our data demonstrated that the initial rate of surface pressure increase upon antibody adsorption to the air-liquid interface strongly predicted the extent of agitation-induced aggregation. Other factors, including the hydrophobicity, equilibrium surface pressure, and interfacial concentration of an antibody, were not adequate predictors of its susceptibility to aggregation. In addition to developing a predictive tool, we extended the interfacial characterization to better understand the mechanisms of antibody aggregation at an air-liquid interface during agitation stress. We believe that the kinetics of antibody rearrangement and conformational change after adsorbing to the interface, leading to the development of attractive antibody-antibody interactions, dictated the extent of aggregation. Overall, our results demonstrate how surface pressure measurements can be implemented as a rapid screening tool for the identification of antibodies with a high propensity to aggregate upon adsorption to an air-liquid interface while also furthering our understanding of interfacially mediated protein aggregation.

A novel extended Granger Causal Model approach demonstrates brain hemispheric differences during face recognition learning. Two main approaches in exploring causal relationships in biological systems using time-series data are the application of Dynamic Causal model (DCM) and Granger Causal model (GCM). These have been extensively applied to brain imaging data and are also readily applicable to a wide range of temporal changes involving genes, proteins or metabolic pathways. However, these two approaches have always been considered to be radically different from each other and therefore used independently. Here we present a novel approach which is an extension of Granger Causal model and also shares the features of the bilinear approximation of Dynamic Causal model. We have first tested the efficacy of the extended GCM by applying it extensively in toy models in both time and frequency domains and then applied it to local field potential recording data collected from in vivo multi-electrode array experiments. We demonstrate face discrimination learning-induced changes in inter- and intra-hemispheric connectivity and in the hemispheric predominance of theta and gamma frequency oscillations in sheep inferotemporal cortex. The results provide the first evidence for connectivity changes between and within left and right inferotemporal cortexes as a result of face recognition learning.

Falls event detection using triaxial accelerometry and barometric pressure measurement. A falls detection system, employing a Bluetooth-based wearable device, containing a triaxial accelerometer and a barometric pressure sensor, is described. The aim of this study is to evaluate the use of barometric pressure measurement, as a surrogate measure of altitude, to augment previously reported accelerometry-based falls detection algorithms. The accelerometry and barometric pressure signals obtained from the waist-mounted device are analyzed by a signal processing and classification algorithm to discriminate falls from activities of daily living. This falls detection algorithm has been compared to two existing algorithms which utilize accelerometry signals alone. A set of laboratory-based simulated falls, along with other tasks associated with activities of daily living (16 tests) were performed by 15 healthy volunteers (9 male and 6 female; age: 23.7 +/- 2.9 years; height: 1.74 +/- 0.11 m). The algorithm incorporating pressure information detected falls with the highest sensitivity (97.8%) and the highest specificity (96.7%).

Deleterious effects of nicotine on the ultrastructure of oocytes: role of gamma-tocotrienol. Previous studies have shown that nicotine enhances oxidative DNA damage and leads to increased lipid peroxidation, which affects embryo development. The present study investigated the effect of daily supplementation of gamma-tocotrienol on oocytes of nicotine-treated mice. Immature female mice (18-25 g) were divided into three groups. For 30 days, group A (control group) received saline (0.2 ml/day s.c.), group B nicotine (5 mg/kg/day s.c. in saline), and group C nicotine with gamma-tocotrienol (60 mg/kg/day p.o.). The animals were superovulated following these schedules. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that the nicotine-treated oocytes appeared nonspherical with rough surface and the zona pellucida (zp) was torn and became irregular. Supplementation with gamma-tocotrienol in the nicotine-treated mice retained the spherical shape of the oocytes with intact zp; however, the surfaces of the oocytes remained irregular and rough. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) following chronic nicotine treatment showed loosening of the boundary and tearing of the zp. The perivitelline space was also widened. The cytoplasm of the oocytes retained abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum (rER) with numerous vesicles. Mitochondria were highly dense, with no cristae. The administration of gamma-tocotrienol partially reduced the detrimental effects of nicotine by retaining the smooth boundary of the zp with the tight perivitelline space. There was less rER with no visible vesicle and a lower amount of dense mitochondrial matrix. This study documented that chronic nicotine treatment adversely affects the ultrastructure of oocytes, while gamma-tocotrienol treatment at least minimizes the nicotine-induced damage to oocytes.

S-acylation of the Insulin-Responsive Aminopeptidase (IRAP): Quantitative analysis and Identification of Modified Cysteines. The insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP) was recently identified as an S-acylated protein in adipocytes and other tissues. However, there is currently no information on the extent of S-acylation of this protein, the residues that are modified, or the effects of S-acylation on IRAP localisation. In this study, we employ a semi-quantitative acyl-RAC technique to show that approximately 60% of IRAP is S-acylated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. In contrast, S-acylation of GLUT4, a glucose transporter that extensively co-localises with IRAP, was approximately five-fold lower. Site-directed mutagenesis was employed to map the sites of S-acylation on IRAP to two cysteine residues, one of which is predicted to lie in the cytoplasmic side of the single transmembrane domain and the other which is just upstream of this transmembrane domain; our results suggest that these cysteines may be modified in a mutually-exclusive manner. Although S-acylation regulates the intracellular trafficking of several transmembrane proteins, we did not detect any effects of mutating the modified cysteines on the plasma membrane localisation of IRAP in HEK293T cells, suggesting that S-acylation is not essential for the movement of IRAP through the secretory pathway. 

Benefit from spatial separation of multiple talkers in bilateral hearing-aid users: Effects of hearing loss, age, and cognition. To study the spatial hearing abilities of bilateral hearing-aid users in multi-talker situations, 20 subjects received fittings configured to preserve acoustic cues salient for spatial hearing. Following acclimatization, speech reception thresholds (SRTs) were measured for three competing talkers that were either co-located or spatially separated along the front-back or left-right dimension. In addition, the subjects' working memory and attentional abilities were measured. Left-right SRTs varied over more than 14 dB, while front-back SRTs varied over more than 8 dB. Furthermore, significant correlations were observed between left-right SRTs, age, and low-frequency hearing loss, and also between front-back SRTs, age, and high-frequency aided thresholds. Concerning cognitive effects, left-right performance was most strongly related to attentional abilities, while front-back performance showed a relation to working memory abilities. Altogether, these results suggest that, due to raised hearing thresholds and aging, hearing-aid users have reduced access to interaural and monaural spatial cues as well as a diminished ability to 'enhance' a target signal by means of top-down processing. These deficits, in turn, lead to impaired functioning in complex listening environments.

Nutrition and physical activity policies and practices in family child care homes. Family child care homes (FCCHs) are the second-largest provider of nonrelative care in the U.S. However, despite providing care for nearly 1.9 million children aged <5 years, little is known about the nutrition and physical activity practices of FCCHs. To address this gap, this study aims to describe policies and practices related to nutrition and physical activity in a representative sample of FCCHs. A stratified random sample of registered FCCHs operating in Kansas (N=297) completed the Nutrition and Physical Activity Self Assessment for Child Care (NAPSACC) instrument. Prevalence estimates and 95% CIs for meeting or exceeding accepted child care standards were calculated using SAS PROC SURVEYFREQ. Most providers either met or exceeded child care standards related to serving fruit and vegetables and provision of daily physical activity. Very few providers reported serving fried meats or vegetables or unhealthy snack foods on a regular basis. Areas of concern included infrequent servings of low-fat milk, frequent use of unhealthy foods for celebrations, widespread use of TV and video games throughout the day, restricting physical activity for children who misbehave, and lack of appropriate indoor spaces for physical activity. Only a small percentage of providers reported receiving regular training in nutrition or physical activity. Relatively few providers had written guidelines on nutrition or physical activity. Some strengths were exhibited by FCCHs, but substantial weaknesses were shown with respect to meeting established child care standards for nutrition and physical activity. Interventions to promote healthy eating and regular physical activity in FCCHs are thus warranted.

AGER1 regulates endothelial cell NADPH oxidase-dependent oxidant stress via PKC-delta: implications for vascular disease. Advanced glycated end-product receptor 1 (AGER1) protects against vascular disease promoted by oxidants, such as advanced glycated end products (AGEs), via inhibition of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, the specific AGEs, sources, and pathways involved remain undefined. The mechanism of cellular NADPH oxidase (NOX)-dependent ROS generation by defined AGEs, N(epsilon)-carboxymethyl-lysine- and methylglyoxal (MG)-modified BSA, was assessed in AGER1 overexpressing (AGER1(+) EC) or knockdown (sh-mRNA-AGER1(+) EC) human aortic endothelial (EC) and ECV304 cells, and aortic segments from old (18 mo) C57BL6-F(2) mice, propagated on low-AGE diet (LAGE), or LAGE supplemented with MG (LAGE+MG). Wild-type EC and sh-mRNA-AGER1(+) EC, but not AGER1(+) EC, had high NOX p47(phox) and gp91(phox) activity, superoxide anions, and NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation in response to MG and N(epsilon)-carboxymethyl-lysine. These events involved epidermal growth factor receptor-dependent PKC-delta redox-sensitive Tyr-311 and Tyr-332 phosphorylation and were suppressed in AGER1(+) ECs and enhanced in sh-mRNA-AGER1(+) ECs. Aortic ROS, PKC-delta Tyr-311, and Tyr-332 phosphorylation, NOX expression, and nuclear p65 in older LAGE+MG mice were significantly increased above that in age-matched LAGE mice, which had higher levels of AGER1. In conclusion, circulating AGEs induce NADPH-dependent ROS generation in vascular aging in both in vitro and in vivo models. Furthermore, AGER1 provides protection against AGE-induced ROS generation via NADPH.

Identification of Api88 Binding Partners in Escherichia coli Using a Photoaffinity-Cross-Link Strategy and Label-Free Quantification. Gene-encoded antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) kill bacteria very efficiently by either lytic mechanisms or inhibition of specific bacterial targets. Proline-rich AMPs (PrAMPs), for example, produced in insects and mammals rely on the second mechanism. They bind to the 70 kDa bacterial heat shock protein DnaK and the 60 kDa chaperonin GroEL and interfere with protein folding, but this does not explain their strong bactericidal effects. Thus, we looked for further binding partners of apidaecin 1b, originally identified in honey bees, and two rationally optimized analogues (Api88 and Api137). Because affinity chromatography using Api88 as an immobilized ligand enriched only a few proteins at low levels besides DnaK, we synthesized Api88 analogues substituting Tyr7 with p-benzoyl-phenylalanine (Bpa), which can cross-link the peptide to binding partners after UV irradiation. Escherichia coli was incubated with biotinylated Api88 Tyr7Bpa or the corresponding all-d-peptide, irradiated, and lysed. The protein extract was enriched by streptavidin, separated by SDS-PAGE, digested with trypsin, and analyzed by nanoRP-UPLC-ESI-QqTOF-MS/MS. Among the 41 proteins identified, 34 were detected only in the l-Api88 Tyr7Bpa sample, including five 70S ribosomal proteins, DNA-directed RNA polymerase, and pyruvate dehydrogenase, indicating that PrAMPs might interfere with protein translation and energy metabolism. 

Neutrophil elastase inhibitor improves survival of rats with clinically relevant sepsis. Sivelestat sodium hydrate is a selective inhibitor of neutrophil elastase, which is effective in acute lung injury associated with systemic inflammatory response syndrome. However, the effectiveness of sivelestat in sepsis has not been fully examined. In the present study, the effect of sivelestat on severe sepsis in a rat cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model was investigated. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent CLP and were randomly divided into two groups: sivelestat-treated group and saline-treated controls. The serum concentrations of several inflammatory mediators were measured. Hematoxylin-eosin staining, and immunohistochemical staining for high-mobility group box chromosomal protein 1 (HMGB1), IL-8, and CD68 were performed on the lungs to assess pathological changes found 12 h after the CLP procedure. Treatment with sivelestat significantly improved the survival rate of the post-CLP septic animals (P = 0.030). Sivelestat also induced a significant reduction in serum IL-1beta (P = 0.038) and IL-10 (P = 0.008) levels in these CLP rats. Serum HMGB1 levels had no significant difference between the sivelestat-treated and the control group. The lungs from sivelestat-treated rats exhibited less severe pathological changes and decreased the numbers of HMGB1, IL-8, and CD68-positive cells (P < 0.001). Sivelestat significantly improved survival rate of rats with clinically relevant sepsis, possibly by attenuating sepsis-induced systemic inflammatory response and lung injury. This may explain the implicated health benefits of sivelestat in reducing morbidity and mortality from sepsis.

Anti-adhesion and antiproliferative cellulose triacetate membrane for prevention of biomaterial-centred infections associated with Staphylococcus epidermidis. The initial step in preventing biomaterial-associated infections consists of preventing bacterial adhesion to the device surface. One possible approach is the design of antibiotic-releasing biomaterials. Cellulose triacetate (CTA) membranes with the antibiotic imipenem (IPM) entrapped (CTA-IPM) were prepared. The material was characterised in terms of surface morphology by scanning electron microscopy, surface free energy of interaction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Antibiotic release studies were also performed. In vitro adhesion of Staphylococcus epidermidis RP62A to CTA-IPM was investigated using a modified microtitre plate assay, and the antibacterial activity of the CTA-IPM membrane was assessed by a modified Kirby-Bauer test, which showed effective entrapment of the antibiotic as confirmed by XPS and hydrophilicity assays. Release studies showed that this drug-polymer conjugate serves as an adequate reservoir for sustained release of IPM over a period of 71h at an effective bacteriostatic concentration. Moreover, bacterial adhesion tests showed a statistically significant decrease in the adhesion of S. epidermidis RP62A to CTA-IPM compared with its adhesion to CTA alone. The present innovative approach is capable of providing a membrane with anti-adhesive and antiproliferative properties, thus encouraging in vivo studies to provide a better simulation of the clinical situation.

Effect of neem (Azardirachta indica A. Juss) seeds and leaves extract on some plant pathogenic fungi. In this study plant pathogenic fungi Alternaria solani, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum were chosen to study the effect of ethanolic, hexane and methanolic extracts of neem seeds and leaves. Antifungal effects of neem leave and seed extracts obtained by ethanol, hexane and ptrolium ether were examined separately in vitro against Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani, Alternaria solani and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Results indicated that seeds and leaves extracts could cause growth inhibition of tested fungi, although the rate of inhibition of tested fungi varied with different extracts and concentrations. But all these extracts and concentrations of extract inhibited the growth of pathogenic fungi at a significant level. Azadirachtin, nimonol and expoxyazdirodione were detected from neem extract by using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). We can conclude that neem leave and seed extracts were effective as antifungal against all tested fungi but F. oxysporum and R. solani were the most sensitive fungi.

Zebra finches exhibit speaker-independent phonetic perception of human speech. Humans readily distinguish spoken words that closely resemble each other in acoustic structure, irrespective of audible differences between individual voices or sex of the speakers. There is an ongoing debate about whether the ability to form phonetic categories that underlie such distinctions indicates the presence of uniquely evolved, speech-linked perceptual abilities, or is based on more general ones shared with other species. We demonstrate that zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata) can discriminate and categorize monosyllabic words that differ in their vowel and transfer this categorization to the same words spoken by novel speakers independent of the sex of the voices. Our analysis indicates that the birds, like humans, use intrinsic and extrinsic speaker normalization to make the categorization. This finding shows that there is no need to invoke special mechanisms, evolved together with language, to explain this feature of speech perception.

In utero diagnosis of congenital pyloric atresia in a single twin using MRI and ultrasound. Congenital pyloric atresia (CPA) is a rare disorder that has traditionally been diagnosed in the postnatal period. With improvements in ultrasound technology and increasing use of MRI, CPA is now diagnosed with increasing accuracy in utero. This also allows for identification of concomitant anomalies, which greatly affects infant survival. In addition, antenatal diagnosis of CPA and associated anomalies allow for family counseling and planning of treatment for the perinatal period including early referral to a center with pediatric surgical services. Here, we present a case of CPA with preoperative diagnosis using ultrasound and MRI.

Angiopoietin-2 in patients requiring renal replacement therapy in the ICU: relation to acute kidney injury, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and outcome. Endothelial activation has emerged as an early event in the pathogenesis of microcirculatory dysfunction, capillary leakage and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS). Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), a circulating antagonistic ligand of the endothelial-specific Tie2 receptor, has been identified as a non-redundant gatekeeper of endothelial activation. On the basis of our previous report demonstrating release of Ang-2 in endotoxemia and sepsis, we aimed to study the utility of Ang-2 to serve as an outcome-specific biomarker in patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) in the intensive care unit (ICU). We measured circulating Ang-2 by ELISA in 117 critically ill patients with AKI at inception of RRT in the ICU. Mortality, length of stay and renal recovery were prospectively assessed during a study period of 28 days after the inception of RRT. Circulating Ang-2 levels were significantly higher in AKI patients with RIFLE category-Injury or -Failure, compared to patients with RIFLE category-Risk. Elevated levels of circulating Ang-2 correlated with impaired oxygenation, low mean arterial pressure, vasopressor dose and the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Ang-2 concentrations were significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors at day 0 and day 14 after initiation of RRT. Multivariate Cox regression and decision tree analyses confirmed a strong independent prognostic impact of elevated Ang-2 as a predictor of 28-day survival. The results from this study indicate that circulating Ang-2 is as a strong and independent predictor of mortality in ICU patients with dialysis-dependent AKI.

Snail hepatopancreatic lipase: a new member of invertebrates lipases' group. Higher animal's lipases are well characterized; however, much less is known about lipases from mollusks. A lipolytic activity was located in the land snail (Eobania vermiculata) digestive glands (hepatopancreas), from which a snail digestive lipase (SnDL) was purified. Pure SnDL has a molecular mass of 60 kDa; it does not present the interfacial activation phenomenon. It was found to be more active on short-chain triacylglycerols than on long-chain triacylglycerols. The NH2-terminal sequence of the SnDL shows 66% of identity with the 17 NH2-terminal amino acids of a putative lipase from sea urchin (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus). No sequence identity was found with known lipases. Interestingly, neither colipase nor bile salts were detected in the snail hepatopancreas. This suggests that colipase evolved in vertebrates simultaneously with the appearance of an exocrine pancreas and a true liver which produces bile salts. Altogether, these results suggest that SnDL is a member of a new group of digestive lipases belonging to invertebrates.

Synthesis of hetero-telechelic alpha,omega bio-functionalized polymers. Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization was used to synthesize poly[diethylene glycol monomethylether methacrylate] (PDEGMA) (M(n) = 6250 g/mol, PDI = 1.14) with a pentafluorophenyl (PFP) activated ester and a dithioester end group. The hormone thyroxin (T4) was quantitatively attached to the PFP activated ester alpha end group via its amino group. The omega-terminal dithioester was not harmed by this reaction and was subsequently aminolyzed in the presence of N-biotinylaminoethyl methanethiosulfonate, yielding a polymer with a thyroxin and a biotin end group with very high heterotelechelic functionality. The polymer was characterized by (1)H, (13)C, and (19)F NMR, UV-vis, and IR spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography. The thyroxin transport protein prealbumin with two thyroxin binding sites and streptavidin, which has four biotin binding sites, was conjugated using the biotarget labeled polymer, resulting in the formation of a protein-polymer network, confirming the heterotelechelic nature of the polymer. Polymer-protein microgel formation was observed with dynamic light scattering. To realize a directed protein assembly, prealbumin was immobilized onto a surface, exposing one of its two thyroxin binding groups and thus allowing the conjugation with the thyroxin alpha end group of the heterotelechelic polymer. The biotin omega end group of the attached polymer layer enabled the subsequent immobilization of streptavidin, yielding a defined multilayer system of two proteins connected with the synthetic polymer (efficiency of streptavidin immobilization 81% based on prealbumin). Without the polymer, no streptavidin immobilization occurred. The layer depositions were monitored by surface plasmon resonance. The synthetic approach of combining PFP activated esters with functional MTS reagents presents a powerful method for obtaining well-defined heterotelechelic (bio-) functionalized polymers.

Novel rank-based statistical methods reveal microRNAs with differential expression in multiple cancer types. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate target genes at the post-transcriptional level and play important roles in cancer pathogenesis and development. Variation amongst individuals is a significant confounding factor in miRNA (or other) expression studies. The true character of biologically or clinically meaningful differential expression can be obscured by inter-patient variation. In this study we aim to identify miRNAs with consistent differential expression in multiple tumor types using a novel data analysis approach. Using microarrays we profiled the expression of more than 700 miRNAs in 28 matched tumor/normal samples from 8 different tumor types (breast, colon, liver, lung, lymphoma, ovary, prostate and testis). This set is unique in putting emphasis on minimizing tissue type and patient related variability using normal and tumor samples from the same patient. We develop scores for comparing miRNA expression in the above matched sample data based on a rigorous characterization of the distribution of order statistics over a discrete state set, including exact p-values. Specifically, we compute a Rank Consistency Score (RCoS) for every miRNA measured in our data. Our methods are also applicable in various other contexts. We compare our methods, as applied to matched samples, to paired t-test and to the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test. We identify consistent (across the cancer types measured) differentially expressed miRNAs. 41 miRNAs are under-expressed in cancer compared to normal, at FDR (False Discovery Rate) of 0.05 and 17 are over-expressed at the same FDR level. Differentially expressed miRNAs include known oncomiRs (e.g miR-96) as well as miRNAs that were not previously universally associated with cancer. Specific examples include miR-133b and miR-486-5p, which are consistently down regulated and mir-629* which is consistently up regulated in cancer, in the context of our cohort. Data is available in GEO. Software is available at: http://bioinfo.cs.technion.ac.il/people/zohar/RCoS/

Phase I trial of 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), a heat shock protein inhibitor, administered twice weekly in patients with advanced malignancies. Phase I dose-escalation study to determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), a heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) inhibitor, administered on a twice weekly schedule in patients with advanced cancer. 17-DMAG was administered as a 1- to 2-h infusion twice weekly in 4-week cycles. An accelerated titration design was followed until toxicity was observed, at which point standard dose-escalation proceeded. MTD was defined as the dose at which no more than one of the six patients experienced a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Pharmacokinetics were assessed, and Hsp70 mRNA, whose gene product is a chaperone previously shown to be upregulated following the inhibition of Hsp90, was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A total of 31 patients received 92 courses of treatment. The MTD was 21mg/m(2)/d; 20 patients were enrolled at this dose level. Nine patients had stable disease for a median of 4 (range 2-22) months. Both C(max) and AUC increased proportionally with dose. The most common toxicities were grade 1 or 2 fatigue, anorexia, nausea, blurred vision and musculoskeletal pain. DLTs were peripheral neuropathy and renal dysfunction. Expression of Hsp70 mRNA in PBMCs was highly variable. Twice-weekly i.v. infusion of 17-DMAG is well tolerated, and combination phase I studies are warranted.


Residual Parenchymal Volume, Not Warm Ischemia Time, Predicts Ultimate Renal Functional Outcomes in Patients Undergoing Partial Nephrectomy.

Novel cell-penetrating peptide targeting mitochondria. Cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are short, nontoxic peptides with cationic and/or amphipathic properties able to cross the cellular membrane. CPPs are used for the delivery of a wide variety of cargoes, such as proteins, oligonucleotides, and therapeutic molecules. The aim of the present study was to synthesize unusually small novel CPPs targeting mitochondria based on the Szeto-Schiller peptide (SS-31) to influence intramitochondrial processes and to improve the biologic effects. All the peptides used were synthesized manually using 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl chemistry. In the first part of the study, HeLa 705, U87, and bEnd.3 cells were used as in vitro delivery model. Cells were incubated for 24 h at 37Â°C and 5% CO2 with different concentrations of our peptides. Cell proliferation assay was performed to evaluate cell viability. Biologic effects such as mitochondrial membrane potential and antioxidant activity were evaluated. H2O2 was used as positive control. Uptake studies were performed using peptides conjugated with 5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (FAM). Fluorescent microscopy was used to determine presence and localization of peptides into the cells. Isolated mitochondria from pretreated cells and mitochondria treated after isolation were used to confirm the targeting ability of the peptide. Uptake of FAM alone was used as negative control. Microscopy studies confirmed the ability of peptides to penetrate cell. Localization analysis showed increase in uptake by 35% compared with SS-31. Mitochondrial CPP 1 (mtCPP-1) had no effect on mitochondrial membrane potential and prevented reactive oxygen species formation in bEnd.3 cells by 2-fold compared with SS-31. No cytotoxicity was observed even at high concentration (100 ÂµM). These data suggest that mtCPP-1 is a mitochondrial CPP and protect mitochondria from oxidative damage due to its own antioxidant activities.

An innovative continuous flow system for monitoring heavy metal pollution in water using transgenic Xenopus laevis tadpoles. While numerous detection methods exist for environmental heavy metal monitoring, easy-to-use technologies combining rapidity with in vivo measurements are lacking. Multiwell systems exploiting transgenic tadpoles are ideal but require time-consuming placement of individuals in wells. We developed a real-time flow-through system, based on Fountain Flow cytometry, which measures in situ contaminant-induced fluorescence in transgenic amphibian larvae immersed in water samples. The system maintains the advantages of transgenic amphibians, but requires minimal human intervention. Portable and self-contained, it allows on-site measurements. Optimization exploited a transgenic Xenopus laevis bearing a chimeric gene with metal responsive elements fused to eGFP. The transgene was selectively induced by 1 microM Zn(2+). Using this tadpole we show the continuous flow method to be as rapid and sensitive as image analysis. Flow-through readings thus accelerate the overall process of data acquisition and render fluorescent monitoring of tadpoles suitable for on-site tracking of heavy metal pollution.

Cloning humans? Biological, ethical, and social considerations. There are, in mankind, two kinds of heredity: biological and cultural. Cultural inheritance makes possible for humans what no other organism can accomplish: the cumulative transmission of experience from generation to generation. In turn, cultural inheritance leads to cultural evolution, the prevailing mode of human adaptation. For the last few millennia, humans have been adapting the environments to their genes more often than their genes to the environments. Nevertheless, natural selection persists in modern humans, both as differential mortality and as differential fertility, although its intensity may decrease in the future. More than 2,000 human diseases and abnormalities have a genetic causation. Health care and the increasing feasibility of genetic therapy will, although slowly, augment the future incidence of hereditary ailments. Germ-line gene therapy could halt this increase, but at present, it is not technically feasible. The proposal to enhance the human genetic endowment by genetic cloning of eminent individuals is not warranted. Genomes can be cloned; individuals cannot. In the future, therapeutic cloning will bring enhanced possibilities for organ transplantation, nerve cells and tissue healing, and other health benefits. 


Risk factors for articular cartilage lesions in symptomatic discoid lateral meniscus.

A randomized trial of massage therapy after heart surgery. To determine whether massage therapy improves postoperative mood, pain, anxiety, and physiologic measurements; shortens hospital stay; and decreases occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Two hundred fifty-two adults undergoing cardiac surgery were randomized to usual postoperative care (n=126) or usual care plus two massages (n=126). Assessments of mood, depression, anxiety, pain, physiologic status, cardiac rhythm, and hospital length of stay were completed. Logistic and linear regressions were performed. Preoperative pain, mood, and affective state scores were positively associated with postoperative scores; however, there were no postoperative differences between groups for any measures (P=.11 to .93). There were no differences in physiologic variables except lower postoperative blood pressure after massage (P = .01). Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurrence (P = .6) and median postoperative hospital length of stay (P = .4) were similar between groups. Massage therapy is feasible in cardiac surgical patients; however, it does not yield therapeutic benefit. Nevertheless, it should be a patient-selected and -paid option.

Sarcopenia as the Biological Substrate of Physical Frailty. Physical function decreases with aging, which may result in adverse outcomes (eg, disability, loss of independence, institutionalization, death). Physical function impairment is a common trait of frailty and sarcopenia. These two conditions, albeit highly common, have not yet received a unique operational definition, which has impeded their implementation in standard practice. Here, we introduce a conceptual model in which sarcopenia is proposed as the biological substrate and the pathway whereby the consequences of physical frailty develop. This conceptualization may open new venues for the design of interventions against physical frailty and promote the translation of findings to the clinical arena. 

A new non-synchronous preparative counter-current centrifuge-the next generation of dynamic extraction/chromatography devices with independent mixing and settling control, which offer a step change in efficiency. A new and significantly more robust design of non-synchronous coil planet centrifuge is introduced where the degree of mixing between two immiscible phases can be changed independently from the "g" field required to separate out the phases. A hypothesis that an optimum ratio between the speed of the bobbin and the speed of the rotor can be found to optimise the efficiency of the separation for a given force field is upheld for an intermediate polarity phase system. This paves the way for extensive further research to find the optimum non-synchronous conditions for a range of different phase systems that are desirable for the separation of large molecules, proteins and biologics but can tend to emulsify in the standard "J" type centrifuge systems currently available and routinely in use for aqueous organic phase systems. A step change of up to 30% in resolution and 90% in plate efficiency is demonstrated.

Prenatal Maternal Physical Activity and Stem Cells in Umbilical Cord Blood. Early life processes, through influence on fetal stem cells, affect postnatal and adult health outcomes. This study examines the effects of physical activity before and during pregnancy on stem cell counts in umbilical cord blood. We isolated mononuclear cells from umbilical cord blood samples from 373 singleton full-term pregnancies and quantified hematopoietic (CD34(+), CD34(+)CD38(-), and CD34(+) c-kit(+)), endothelial (CD34(+)CD133(+), CD34(+)CD133(+)VEGFR2(+), CD34(+)VEGFR2(+), and CD133(+)VEGFR2(+)), and putative breast (EpCAM(+), EpCAM(+)CD49f(+), EpCAM(+)CD49f(+)CD117(+), CD49f(+)CD24(+), CD24(+)CD29(+), and CD24(+)CD29(+)CD49f(+)) stem/progenitor cell subpopulations by flow cytometry. Information on physical activities before and during pregnancy was obtained from questionnaires. Weekly energy expenditure was estimated based on metabolic equivalent task values. Prepregnancy vigorous exercise was associated positively with levels of endothelial CD34(+)CD133(+), CD34(+)CD133(+)VEGFR2(+), CD34(+)VEGFR2(+), and CD133(+)VEGFR2(+ )progenitor cell populations (P = 0.02, P = 0.01, P = 0.001, and P = 0.003, respectively); positive associations were observed in samples from the first births and those from the second or later births. Prepregnancy moderate and light exercises and light exercise during the first trimester were not significantly associated with any stem/progenitor cell population. Light exercise during the second trimester was positively associated with CD34(+)VEGFR2(+) endothelial progenitor cells (P = 0.03). In addition, levels of EpCAM(+)CD49f(+) and CD49f(+)CD24(+) breast stem cells were significantly lower among pregnant women who engaged in vigorous/moderate exercise during pregnancy (P = 0.05 and P = 0.02, respectively). Vigorous exercise before pregnancy increases the number of endothelial progenitor cells in umbilical cord blood and thus could potentially enhance endothelial function and improve cardiovascular fitness in the offspring. Findings of lower levels of putative breast stem cell subpopulations could have implications on exercise and breast cancer prevention. Prenatal effects of exercise on fetal stem cells warrant further studies.

Effects of nickel on the chloroplasts of the duckweeds Spirodela polyrhiza and Lemna minor and their possible use in biomonitoring and phytoremediation. Toxic effects of Ni(2+) on the chloroplasts of the two duckweed species Spirodela polyrhiza, clone SJ and Lemna minor, clone St were investigated according to the ISO 20079 protocol. Ni(2+) induced a transition from chloroplasts to chloro-amyloplasts and amylo-chloroplasts, but not to gerontoplasts, as shown by electron microscopy. The contents of the chlorophylls a and b decreased strongly, whereas that of carotenoids remained approximately constant. Most striking was, however, the accumulation of transitory starch. Bell-shaped dose-response curves showed that Spirodela and Lemna amassed maximum starch contents of approximately 10% and 7%, respectively, on a fresh weight basis. Because Ni(2+) in the concentrations applied does not stimulate photosynthesis, the Ni(2+)-induced starch accumulation indicates that the export of carbohydrates out of the plastids decreased, most probably due to the lower demand of the rest of the cells as a result of the Ni(2+)-dependent inhibition of growth. The half-maximal concentrations for inhibition of the fresh weight increase over the 7-day test period were 3.7 microM and 6.6 microM for Spirodela and Lemna, respectively: Spirodela was thus somewhat more sensitive to the heavy metal. Both species accumulated approximately 3g of Ni(2+) per kg of dry weight after application of 100 microM NiCl(2). Because of their high sensitivity to phytotoxic effects, however, Spirodela and Lemna do not appear to be particularly suitable for phytoremediation of Ni(2+)-contaminated waste water. The high sensitivity to Ni(2+) makes them instead a suitable system for ecotoxicological testing in accordance with the ISO 20079 protocol.

Periodontal management of a patient with severe aplastic anemia: a case report.

Fixed-time artificial insemination in beef cattle. The study was designed to test the effect of fixed-time artificial insemination (fixed-AI) after the slightly modified Ovsynch protocol on the pregnancy rate in beef cattle in Finnish field conditions. The modification was aimed to optimize the number of offsprings per AI dose. Ninety Charolais cows and heifers were entered into the program an average of 1.8 times. Thus, 164 animal cases were included. Animals were administered 10-12 microg of buserelin. Seven days later animals without a corpus luteum (CL) were rejected (20.7%) while the remaining 130 cases with a CL were administered prostaglandin F2alpha, followed 48 h later with a second injection of buserelin (8-10 microg). Fixed-AI was performed 16-20 hours after the last injection. The pregnancy rate was 51.5% (67/130). The pregnancy rate after a short interval (50-70 d) from calving to entering the program was significantly higher than that after a long interval (>70 d). This protocol seems to give acceptable pregnancy results in beef herds and its effect on saving labour is notable.

The corporatization of community pharmacy: implications for service provision, the public health function, and pharmacy's claims to professional status in the United Kingdom. Pharmacy has experienced both incomplete professionalization and deprofessionalization. Since the late 1970s, a concerted attempt has been made to re-professionalize pharmacy in the United Kingdom (UK) through role extension-a key feature of which has been a drive for greater pharmacy involvement in public health. However, the continual corporatization of the UK community pharmacy sector may reduce the professional autonomy of pharmacists and may threaten to constrain attempts at reprofessionalization. The objectives of the research: to examine the public health activities of community pharmacists in the UK; to explore the attitudes of community pharmacists toward recent relevant UK policy and barriers to the development of their public health function; and, to investigate associations between activity, attitudes, and the type of community pharmacy worked in (eg, supermarket, chain, independent). A self-completion postal questionnaire was sent to a random sample of practicing community pharmacists, stratified for country and sex, within Great Britain (n=1998), with a follow-up to nonresponders 4 weeks later. Data were analyzed using SPSS (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) (v12.0). A final response rate of 51% (n=1023/1998) was achieved. The level of provision of emergency hormonal contraception on a patient group direction, supervised administration of medicines, and needle-exchange schemes was lower in supermarket pharmacies than in the other types of pharmacy. Respondents believed that supermarkets and the major multiple pharmacy chains held an advantageous position in terms of attracting financing for service development despite suggesting that the premises of such pharmacies may not be the most suitable for the provision of such services. A mixed market in community pharmacy may be required to maintain a comprehensive range of pharmacy-based public health services and provide maximum benefit to all patients. Longitudinal monitoring is recommended to ensure that service provision is adequate across the pharmacy network.

Electrophysiological and morphological features underlying neurotransmission efficacy at the splanchnic nerve-chromaffin cell synapse of bovine adrenal medulla. The ability of adrenal chromaffin cells to fast-release catecholamines relies on their capacity to fire action potentials (APs). However, little attention has been paid to the requirements needed to evoke the controlled firing of APs. Few data are available in rodents and none on the bovine chromaffin cell, a model extensively used by researchers. The aim of this work was to clarify this issue. Short puffs of acetylcholine (ACh) were fast perifused to current-clamped chromaffin cells and produced the firing of single APs. Based on the currents generated by such ACh applications and previous literature, current waveforms that efficiently elicited APs at frequencies up to 20 Hz were generated. Complex waveforms were also generated by adding simple waveforms with different delays; these waveforms aimed at modeling the stimulation patterns that a chromaffin cell would conceivably undergo upon strong synaptic stimulation. Cholinergic innervation was assessed using the acetylcholinesterase staining technique on the supposition that the innervation pattern is a determinant of the kind of stimuli chromaffin cells can receive. It is concluded that 1) a reliable method to produce frequency-controlled APs by applying defined current injection waveforms is achieved; 2) the APs thus generated have essentially the same features as those spontaneously emitted by the cell and those elicited by fast-ACh perifusion; 3) the higher frequencies attainable peak at around 30 Hz; and 4) the bovine adrenal medulla shows abundant cholinergic innervation, and chromaffin cells show strong acetylcholinesterase staining, consistent with a tight cholinergic presynaptic control of firing frequency.


Understanding externalizing behavior from children's personality and parenting characteristics.

Coenzyme Q10 is frequently reduced in muscle of patients with mitochondrial myopathy. Coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)) deficiency has been associated with an increasing number of clinical phenotypes. Whereas primary CoQ(10) defects are related to mutations in ubiquinone biosynthetic genes, which are now being unraveled, and respond well to CoQ(10) supplementation, the etiologies, and clinical phenotypes related to secondary deficiencies are largely unknown. The purpose of this multicenter study was to evaluate the frequency of muscle CoQ(10) deficiency in a cohort of 76 patients presenting with clinically heterogeneous mitochondrial phenotypes which included myopathy among their clinical features. A reliable diagnostic tool based on HPLC quantification was employed to measure muscle CoQ(10) levels. A significant proportion of these patients (28 over 76) displayed CoQ(10) deficiency that was clearly secondary in nine patients, who harbored a pathogenic mutation of mitochondrial DNA. This study provides a rationale for future therapeutic trials on the effect of CoQ(10) supplementation in patients with mitochondrial diseases presenting with myopathy among clinical features.

24-Hour versus daytime intraocular pressure phasing in the management of patients with treated glaucoma. To determine the value of daytime and 24-h phasing in patients treated for progressive glaucoma despite apparently adequate intraocular pressure (IOP) control. A retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients that had undergone either daytime phasing (08:00-18:00) or 24-h phasing was conducted. IOP measurements were compared between those taken in clinic, daytime phasing and 24-h phasing. The frequency with which phasing results changed clinical management was also compared between daytime and 24-h phasing. 76 patients fulfilling the study criteria were identified. Clinic and daytime phasing IOP were known for all 76 patients, nighttime IOP measurements were known for 41. There was no significant difference between mean IOP values measured in clinic and daytime phasing (p=0.062) or between clinic values and nighttime phasing (p=0.65). The mean daytime phasing IOP was significantly higher than the mean nighttime phasing IOP (p=0.038) (analysis of variance (ANOVA) for three groups, p=0.058). There was no significant difference between the mean peak IOP in clinic or daytime phasing (p=0.13) or between clinic and nighttime phasing (p=0.44). The mean daytime phasing IOP peak was significantly higher than the mean nighttime phasing IOP peak (p=0.015) (ANOVA for three groups, p=0.074). There was no significant difference in the frequency of a change in management that occurred as a result of phasing between the daytime and 24-h groups (p=0.65). 24-H phasing offers little advantage over daytime phasing in the identification of IOP fluctuations or peaks in patients progressing despite acceptable clinic IOP readings. Daytime phasing is likely to be more cost-effective than 24-h phasing.

Trabeculectomy for normal tension glaucoma: outcomes using the Moorfields Safer Surgery technique. To evaluate long-term outcomes and complications of trabeculectomy for normal tension glaucoma (NTG) with contemporary surgical techniques. Retrospective consecutive, non-comparative case series of 131 eyes of 98 patients undergoing trabeculectomy between 2007 and 2013 in a dedicated NTG clinic. Data collected during routine clinical care were analysed. Assessment of clinical outcomes included intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction, bleb function, final visual acuity, evidence of glaucoma progression, postoperative complications and further surgical intervention. Surgical failure was defined as a failure to meet specified IOP-related criteria, the need to undergo further glaucoma surgery for raised IOP or loss of light perception vision. A further analysis was also performed which considered failure as glaucoma progression following surgery. Outcomes were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier life-table analysis. The cumulative percentages of unqualified success as defined by a â¥30% reduction of IOP from baseline preoperative maximum (95% CI; IOP of all eyes: meanÂ±SD) at 1, 2, 3 and 4âyears after surgery were 91.1% (84.1% to 95.1%; 9.7Â±2.9âmmâHg), 74.1% (63.7% to 81.8%; 10.3Â±3.0âmmâHg), 64.8% (52.7% to 74.6%; 10.6Â±2.5âmmâHg) and 62.1% (49.3% to 72.6%; 10.2Â±2.1âmmâHg), respectively. At 2âyears of follow-up there was no significant association between either previous cataract surgery or ethnicity and failure. Cumulative percentages of unqualified success at 4âyears after surgery as defined by a filtering trabeculectomy bleb or absence of glaucoma progression were 91.6% (83.2% to 95.9%) and 92.3% (81.3% to 97.0%), respectively. Postoperative complications such as early (2.3%) and late (0.8%) hypotony were significantly lower than suggested by the current literature. Trabeculectomy in NTG patients undertaken using contemporary surgical techniques and intensive postoperative management is associated with more successful long-term outcomes and fewer complications than the currently available literature suggests.


Longitudinal MRI and MRSI characterization of the quinolinic acid rat model for excitotoxicity: peculiar apparent diffusion coefficients and recovery of N-acetyl aspartate levels.

Safety and efficacy of deep brain stimulation in refractory cluster  headache: a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial  followed by a 1-year open extension. Chronic cluster headache (CCH) is a disabling primary headache, considering the severity and frequency of pain attacks. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been used to treat severe refractory CCH, but assessment of its efficacy has been limited to open studies. We performed a prospective crossover, double-blind, multicenter study assessing the efficacy and safety of unilateral hypothalamic DBS in 11 patients with severe refractory CCH. The randomized phase compared active and sham stimulation during 1-month periods, and was followed by a 1-year open phase. The severity of CCH was assessed by the weekly attacks frequency (primary outcome), pain intensity,sumatriptan injections, emotional impact (HAD) and quality of life (SF12). Tolerance was assessed by active surveillance of behavior, homeostatic and hormonal functions.During the randomized phase, no significant change in primary and secondary outcome measures was observed between active and sham stimulation. At the end of the open phase, 6/11 responded to the chronic stimulation(weekly frequency of attacks decrease [50%), including three pain-free patients. There were three serious adverse events, including subcutaneous infection, transient loss of consciousness and micturition syncopes. No significant change in hormonal functions or electrolytic balance was observed. Randomized phase findings of this study did not support the efficacy of DBS in refractory CCH, but open phase findings suggested long-term efficacy in more than 50% patients, confirming previous data, without high morbidity. Discrepancy between these findings justifies additional controlled studies (clinicaltrials.gov number NCT00662935).

A Systematic Review of Tools Used to Assess Team Leadership in Health Care Action Teams. To summarize the characteristics of tools used to assess leadership in health care action (HCA) teams. HCA teams are interdisciplinary teams performing complex, critical tasks under high-pressure conditions. The authors conducted a systematic review of the PubMed/MEDLINE, CINAHL, ERIC, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases, key journals, and review articles published through March 2012 for English-language articles that applied leadership assessment tools to HCA teams in all specialties. Pairs of reviewers assessed identified articles for inclusion and exclusion criteria and abstracted data on study characteristics, tool characteristics, and validity evidence. Of the 9,913 abstracts screened, 83 studies were included. They described 61 team leadership assessment tools. Forty-nine tools (80%) provided behaviors, skills, or characteristics to define leadership. Forty-four tools (72%) assessed leadership as one component of a larger assessment, 13 tools (21%) identified leadership as the primary focus of the assessment, and 4 (7%) assessed leadership style. Fifty-three studies (64%) assessed leadership at the team level; 29 (35%) did so at the individual level. Assessments of simulated (n = 55) and live (n = 30) patient care events were performed. Validity evidence included content validity (n = 75), internal structure (n = 61), relationship to other variables (n = 44), and response process (n = 15). Leadership assessment tools applied to HCA teams are heterogeneous in content and application. Comparisons between tools are limited by study variability. A systematic approach to team leadership tool development, evaluation, and implementation will strengthen understanding of this important competency.

Use of a novel robotic interface to study finger motor control. Stroke is the leading cause of permanent adult disability in the U.S., frequently resulting in chronic motor impairments. Rehabilitation of the upper limb, particularly the hand, is especially important as arm and hand deficits post-stroke limit the performance of activities of daily living and, subsequently, functional independence. Hand rehabilitation is challenging due to the complexity of motor control of the hand. New instrumentation is needed to facilitate examination of the hand. Thus, a novel actuated exoskeleton for the index finger, the FingerBot, was developed to permit the study of finger kinetics and kinematics under a variety of conditions. Two such novel environments, one applying a spring-like extension torque proportional to angular displacement at each finger joint and another applying a constant extension torque at each joint, were compared in 10 stroke survivors with the FingerBot. Subjects attempted to reach targets located throughout the finger workspace. The constant extension torque assistance resulted in a greater workspace area (p < 0.02) and a larger active range of motion for the metacarpophalangeal joint (p < 0.01) than the spring-like assistance. Additionally, accuracy in terms of reaching the target was greater with the constant extension assistance as compared to no assistance. The FingerBot can be a valuable tool in assessing various hand rehabilitation paradigms following stroke.

Validity and reliability of the community-environmental index regarding daily living among the mental disorders in community: an assessment instrument based on community nursing activity. The purpose of this study was to examine validity and reliability of a community-environmental assessment instrument analysing community-environmental conditions among the mental disorders in a community. Thirty-three factors were extracted from the data based on a nationwide investigation by the factor analysis. The principal component analysis was applied to these extracted factors, and the first principal component score (1PCS) was interpreted as a synthetic index regarding daily living of the mental disorders in the community. Then, validity and reliability of 1PCS were confirmed. The item analyses from a viewpoint of statistics processing were adopted. As a result, coefficient alpha of the reliability was calculated from the scores and variances, and its value was 0.96. Next, kappa statistic was calculated in order to confirm whether two indices derived from the 52-item and 33-item questionnaires had the correspondence of the actual conditions with 1PCS in regard to the population scale of the municipality. As a result, the kappa was 0.94. In this study, we proposed the 33-item questionnaire composed of 33 factors. This was called as the Morita's community-environmental index (MCEI). It was suggested that the MCEI was useful to assess community-environmental conditions regarding daily living of the mental disorders in the community.

Confirmation and extension of association of blood lead with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and ADHD symptom domains at population-typical exposure levels. Recent studies have suggested that child attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and its symptom domains are related to blood lead level, even at background exposure levels typical in western countries. However, recent studies disagreed as to whether lead was related to inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity within the ADHD domain. More definitive evaluation of these questions was sought. Two hundred and thirty-six (236) children aged 6-17 years participated (61 ADHD-Combined type, 47 ADHD Predominantly Inattentive type, 99 non-ADHD control, 29 unclassified borderline, situational, or not otherwise specified (NOS) cases). Formal diagnosis was reliably established by a best estimate procedure based on a semi-structured clinical interview and parent and teacher ratings. Lead was assayed from whole blood using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry with a method detection limit of .3 microg/dL. Blood lead levels were slightly below United States and Western Europe population exposure averages, with a mean of .73 and a maximum of 2.2 microg/dL. This is the lowest level of blood lead ever studied in relation to ADHD. After statistical control for covariates including IQ and prenatal smoking exposure, blood lead was associated with ADHD-combined type but not inattentive type. Parent and teacher report indicated association of blood lead with Conners cognitive problems, but only teacher report showed effects on DSM-IV inattention symptoms. Blood lead was associated with hyperactivity-impulsivity in parent report regardless of measurement method, whereas teacher report effects depended on child treatment history. These findings confirm that in children with typical US population lead exposure, careful identification of children with ADHD also identifies children with slightly elevated blood lead.

Contribution of genetic influences to animal-to-animal variation in myoglobin content and beef lean color stability. Longissimus thoracis steaks from steers (n = 464) with 0 to 50% inheritance of Angus, Charolais, Gelbvieh, Hereford, Limousin, Red Angus, and Simmental were evaluated during 6 d of display to assess genetic contributions to color stability. Color space values [CIE L* (lightness), a* (redness), b* (yellowness)], chroma, color change (DeltaE), and surface metmyoglobin (K/S 572/525) were determined on d 0 and 6 of display. Myoglobin concentration was highly heritable (0.85), but ultimate pH was weakly heritable (0.06). Day 0 L* values were moderately heritable (0.24). Variation in metmyoglobin, L*, and DeltaE on d 6 was moderately explained by genetic factors (41, 40, and 29%, respectively). Change during display was moderately heritable for a* (0.31), b* (0.23), chroma (0.35), and surface metmyoglobin (0.29). At the start of display, Angus steaks had greater (P < 0.05) L* values than those from all breeds except Charolais. On d 6, Angus steaks had greater (P < 0.05) L* (50.0) values than Gelbvieh, Hereford, and Simmental steaks (46.1, 44.0, and 44.5, respectively). Day 0 values for a*, b*, chroma, and DeltaE were not affected by breed (P > 0.05). On d 6, a* values were greater (P < 0.05) for Charolais and Limousin steaks (31.1 and 30.5) than Angus, Hereford, and Red Angus steaks (27.4, 27.7, and 26.3, respectively). Thus, a* changed less (P < 0.05) in Charolais and Limousin steaks (1.8 and 2.6, respectively) vs. steaks from other breeds. Day 6 b* values were greater (P < 0.05) in Charolais (24.5) and Limousin steaks (24.0) vs. Gelbvieh (22.2), Hereford (21.9), and Red Angus steaks (21.4). Thus, b* values changed less (P < 0.05) in Charolais and Limousin steaks (1.5 and 1.7, respectively) than in Angus, Gelbvieh, Hereford, and Red Angus steaks (4.3, 3.8, 4.4, and 5.1, respectively). After 6 d of display, Charolais and Limousin steaks had greater chroma (P < 0.05; 39.5 and 38.8, respectively) compared with Angus, Hereford, and Red Angus steaks (35.4, 35.3, and 33.9, respectively). Less (P < 0.05) change in chroma occurred for Charolais and Limousin (2.1 and 2.8, respectively) than in Angus, Gelbvieh, Hereford, and Red Angus steaks (7.1, 6.6, 7.4, and 9.0, respectively). Myoglobin concentration was less for Charolais and Limousin (P < 0.05; 2.77 and 2.72, respectively) compared with Gelbvieh, Red Angus, and Simmental steaks (3.62, 3.43, and 3.71, respectively). Breeds did not differ in pH (P > 0.05). These data suggest Charolais- and Limousin-carcasses produced steaks with greater lean color stability than Angus, Hereford, and Red Angus carcasses. Furthermore, these findings suggest that genetics contribute substantially to animal-to-animal variation in lean color, particularly in maintaining color.


A method for robust model order reduction in pharmacokinetics.

Evaluating an organized palliative care approach in patients with severe stroke. A recent survey found few guidelines on the provision of palliative care following stroke; none examined the efficacy or results of any such process. The role of the patient's family in decision making and in conflicts with staff has not been evaluated. We sought to formally evaluate the use of locally-developed palliative care guidelines on our Acute Stroke Unit (ASU). We retrospectively examined records of 104 patients who died on our ASU over a two-year period to determine if our existing palliative guidelines were reflected in clinical practice, and to identify conflicts that arose. Data on medical and nursing care, palliative decisions, and medication use were compared to the ASU's existing palliative care guidelines. Family concerns about the palliative process were also reviewed. Of patients admitted to the stroke unit, 104 (16% of total admissions) died. Ninety-four (90.4%) of these were palliated; all received routine nursing and comfort care prior to death. Median time from admission to palliation was 3.6 days; median time from admission to death was 8.5 days. Most had vital signs (98.9%), investigations (100%) and non-palliative medications (95.7%) stopped, and had nasogastric feeding (96.8%) and intravenous fluids (87.2%) withdrawn or never begun. Most were treated with morphine (93.6%) and scopolamine (81.9%). Concerns raised by family members centered around hydration and feeding (45.7%), doubts about palliative care (27.8%) and patient comfort (18.2%). A formal approach to palliation results in timely decisions regarding end of life care with relatively few conflicts. Further work to address the specific concerns of families is needed.

Community composition of soil bacteria nearly a decade after a fire in a tropical rainforest in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. Soil bacterial community compositions in burnt and unburnt areas in a tropical rainforest in East Kalimantan, Indonesia, were investigated 8 and 9 years after a fire by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis targeting the 16S rRNA gene. Three study sites were set in the forest area devoid of fire damage (control), and in the lightly damaged and heavily damaged forest areas. Succession of aboveground vegetation in the two damaged areas had clearly proceeded after the fire, but the vegetation types still differed from the unburnt area at the time of this study. Community composition of total soil bacteria was similar among the three areas, and so was that of actinobacteria. However, the composition of ammonia oxidizing bacteria clearly differed depending on the presence or absence of past fire damage. These results indicate that even nearly a decade after the forest fire, impacts of the fire remained on the community composition of ammonia oxidizing bacteria, but not apparently on those of dominant bacteria and actinobacteria.

Mesenchymal stem cells transplantation mildly ameliorates experimental diabetic nephropathy in rats.

Anodophilic biofilm catalyzes cathodic oxygen reduction. Poor cathodic oxygen reduction and the detrimental buildup of a pH gradient between anode and cathode are the major hurdles in the development of sustainable microbial fuel cells (MFCs). This article describes and tests a concept that can help overcoming both of these limitations, by inverting the polarity of the MFC repeatedly, allowing anodic and cathodic reactions to occur alternately in the same half-cell and hence neutralizing its respective pH effects. For simplicity, we studied polarity inversion exclusively in one half-cell, maintaining its potential at -300 mV (vs Ag/AgCl) by a potentiostat. An alternating supply of acetate and dissolved oxygen to the biofilm resulted in the tested half-cell repeatedly changing from an anode to a cathode and vice versa. This repeated inversion of current direction avoided the detrimental drifting of the electrolyte pH. Control runs without current inversion ceased to produce current, as a result of anode acidification. The presence of the anodophilic biofilm survived the intermittent oxygen exposure and could measurably facilitate the cathodic reaction by reducing the apparent oxygen overpotential. It enabled cathodic oxygen reduction at about -150 mV (vs Ag/AgCl) compared to -300 mV (vs Ag/AgCl) for the same electrode material (granular graphite) without biofilm. Provided that a suitable cathodic potential was chosen, the presence of "anodophilic bacteria" at the cathode could enable a 5-fold increase in power output. Overall, the ability of an electrochemically active biofilm to catalyze both substrate oxidation and cathodic oxygen reduction in a single bioelectrochemical system has been documented. This property could be useful to alleviate both the cathodic oxygen reduction and the detrimental drifting of electrolyte pH in an MFC system. Further research is warranted to explore the application of such bidirectional microbial catalytic properties for sustainable MFC processes.


Systematic review with meta-analysis: coffee consumption and the risk of gallstone disease.

In vivo evaluation of a new sustained-release formulation of morphine. The pharmacokinetics of a novel sustained-release oral formulation of morphine have been evaluated. The formulation consisted of tablets containing a morphine-EudragitL complex (MEC) which had shown good sustained-release properties in previous in vitro dissolution studies. MEC tablets were administered orally to beagle dogs and the morphine plasma levels and pharmacokinetic parameters obtained were compared with those obtained with MST Continus, a commercially available sustained release form of morphine. Blood samples were withdrawn up to 12 h after dosing and plasma morphine concentrations were determined by HPLC with electrochemical detection. Both formulations presented a relatively rapid absorption of morphine with similar values of Cmax (MST: 53 ng/ml; MEC: 50 ng/ml) and Tmax (MST: 86 min; MEC: 88 min), and prolonged morphine plasma levels. Mean plasma morphine concentrations were higher for the MEC tablets than for MST tablets during the terminal phase of the corresponding curves and the mean AUC(0-12h) for MEC tablets was 138% of that obtained with MST tablets. Our findings indicate that MEC tablets can produce prolonged plasma levels of morphine and could be an alternative to commercially available morphine sustained-release forms.

Robust Algorithm for Systematic Classification of Malaria Late Treatment Failures as Recrudescence or Reinfection Using Microsatellite Genotyping.

Twenty years on: the inner workings of the shoot apical meristem, a developmental dynamo. The shoot apical meristem of angiosperm plants generates leaf, stem and floral structures throughout the plant's lifetime. To do this, the plant must maintain a population of stem cells within the meristem while at the same time carefully controlling the placement and establishment of new leaf primordia. As there is little cell rearrangement in plants, underlying patterning mechanisms must exert careful control of cell division rates and orientations to achieve the correct final form. It has been twenty years since the first genes controlling meristem development were molecularly cloned. In the intervening decades, our understanding of the inner workings directing meristem development has increased enormously. This review summarizes our current knowledge of how the meristem functions as a persistent organ generating center. The story that emerges is one in which transcription factor activity combines with the action of the classic plant growth regulators auxin and cytokinin and with the action of more recently discovered small peptides to control proliferation and cell fate in the shoot apical meristem.


Attention K-Mart shoppers: blowout on Aisle 7!

An audit of the outcome of amblyopia treatment: a retrospective analysis of 322 children. Little is known about the effectiveness of occlusion therapy in hospital settings. A retrospective analysis was conducted to assess modalities, outcome and hospital costs of children treated for amblyopia with patching in a UK clinic. Notes of 322 children with amblyopia discharged after occlusion treatment were selected consecutively and reviewed. Data collated included age at presentation, amblyopia type, visual acuity (VA; before/after occlusion and at discharge), number of prescribed hours of occlusion, duration of patching treatment, number of glasses prescribed and number of visits attended or failed to attend. Hospital treatment costs were estimated. Mixed amblyopes were prescribed the longest amount of patching (mean 2815 h over 23 months) followed by strabismic (1984 h) and anisometropic (1238 h) amblyopes. 319 amblyopes received glasses and five atropine treatment. The percentage of patients reaching VA of 6/12 was best in the anisometropic and strabismic groups (>75%) and worse in mixed amblyopia (64%). Average hospital costs were estimated at pound1365. Although the mean duration of treatment was long, involving many hospital visits, the visual outcome was variable, unsatisfactory (<6/9) and more expensive than necessary. As compliance has been identified as a major problem methods to improve amblyopia treatment are needed, possibly by using educational/motivational intervention.

Budd-Chiari syndrome owing to liver hydatid disease: case report and review of the literature. Liver hydatid disease causes significant morbidity but portal hypertension is a rare complication. The mechanism may be pre-hepatic, hepatic, or post-hepatic. Echinococcus granulosus or E. alveolaris may be involved; the latter is associated with infiltration and liver failure. A 13-year-old girl presented with two large unilocular liver hydatids complicated by chronic Budd-Chiari syndrome. Analysis of the ascitic fluid demonstrated a transudate and results of liver function tests were normal. CT scan showed compression at the level of the hepatic veins opening into the vena cava, with multiple collaterals. The patient underwent cystectomy and capittonage which was followed by reversal of the portal hypertension and ascites. This is probably only the second case to be reported in the English-language literature.

Treatment of early-stage glottic cancer: meta-analysis comparison of laser excision versus radiotherapy. The primary objective of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to compare the oncologic outcomes of external radiation (XRT) and transoral laser (TOL) surgical excision in the treatment of early-stage glottic cancer. The secondary outcome examined was posttreatment voice quality. Meta-analysis. Systematic methods were used to identify published and unpublished data. Two reviewers screened all titles and abstracts for relevance and independently assessed all articles. All identified studies were retrospective. Local control, overall survival, laryngectomy-free survival, and posttreatment voice quality. For oncologic control, case series were pooled as a composite group using a random effects model. The analysis was based on over 7600 patients. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. There were no significant differences between TOL surgery and XRT for local control (OR 0.81, 95% CI 0.51-1.3) and laryngectomy-free survival (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.39-1.35). For overall survival, the analysis favoured TOL surgery (OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.19-1.85). For voice quality, there were no objective differences; however, there was a trend toward superiority for XRT. This is the first study to examine the management of early glottic cancer using meta-analytic methodology. The analysis shows that although there is a trend favouring TOL surgery for overall survival, there is no clear difference in oncologic outcome between TOL surgery and XRT. However, there is a trend toward improved posttreatment voice quality with XRT. This is of questionable clinical significance as objective voice analyses often do not correlate with subjective assessments.

Tamarindus indica L. (Fabaceae): patterns of use in traditional African medicine. To increase the understanding of the ethnopharmacology of a single species, elaboration of dispersed primary data is required. Tamarindus indica L. (Fabaceae), or tamarind, is a common tree, especially in West Africa, with a good potential to contribute to affordable local health care based on traditional medicine (TM). For this single species review, more than 60 references with detailed information on the ethnopharmacology of Tamarindus indica in the African context were selected. It showed that most prominently, the fruits are used as laxative or febrifuge throughout the Sahel and Soudan ecological zones. Tamarind bark and leaves are often involved in the treatment of wounds, especially in central West Africa. While the bark is used to treat diarrhoea in West Africa, the leaves are used for this purpose in East Africa. Our findings suggest a difference in the way tamarind is used between East and West Africa and we assess the similarities of its uses within those regions. This review demonstrates the capability of literature research to reveal knowledge by mining and compiling information from the growing body of primary ethnopharmacologic data, much of which is published in this journal. By creating a specific profile of tamarind in the context of traditional medicine throughout Africa, the authors contribute to the collection of current ethnobotanic species accounts on Tamarindus indica that tend to be qualitative and more general.


Parasternal electromyography to determine the relationship between patient-ventilator asynchrony and nocturnal gas exchange during home mechanical ventilation set-up.

[Protective effect of diclofenac towards the oxidative stress induced by paracetamol toxicity in rats]. Association of paracetamol (PARA) and diclofenac (DiCF) is the aim of our study. 60 male rats "Albinos wistar" were treated by oral gavage (per os) during seven days. A control group was treated by mineral water (0+0) mg/kg and a second group was treated with only a toxic dose of 100 mg/kg of PARA (100+0). Remaining lots were treated with a combination of different toxic doses of PARA and a therapeutic dose of DiCF (15+3, 100+3, 200+3 and 400+3) mg/kg. Plasma concentration of amiotransferases (ASAT, ALAT), alkalines phosphatase (ALP), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione (GSH), glucose, cholesterol, creatinin, direct and total bilirubin, significantly varied in the treated rats regarding to the witness's rats. The toxicity of PARA revealed by a dose dependant blood increases of ASAT, ALAT, ALP, GPx, GR, glucose, creatinin, bilirubin, and by decreases of cholesterol concentration and tissue GSH in comparisons to controls. The depletion of GSH and the increase of the oxidative stress enzymes (GPx and GR) suggest a detoxification function of the glutathione system. The association (PARA + DiCF) revealed a protective effect, resulting in the increase of the concentrations of ASAT, ALAT, ALP, GPx, GR, bilirubin and the increase of GSH. Regarding to all these results, it has been suggested that DiCF has a protective action towards the toxic effects of PARA.

Hypothalamic-brainstem circuits controlling eating. It is now axiomatic that neurons in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus have a primary role in responding to changes in circulating levels of leptin and transmitting signals to downstream circuits that influence eating and energy expenditure. Signals generated from the gastrointestinal tract during meals reach the brainstem, via the vagus nerve and other routes, and impinge on neural circuits that influence the timing and size of meals and amount of food consumed. One of the mechanisms by which leptin exerts its anorexic effects is by increasing the effectiveness of intestinal signals that cause satiation during a meal. It is clear that the effects of gut satiation signals such as CCK can be amplified by leptin acting in the CNS, and in the arcuate nucleus in particular. The present article describes the state of our knowledge about specific neural circuits between the hypothalamus and brainstem that play a role in the interaction of leptin and meal-control signals to control food intake.

Focal epilepsy in the Belgian shepherd: evidence for simple Mendelian inheritance. To establish the mode of inheritance and describe the clinical features of epilepsy in the Belgian shepherd, taking the outset in an extended Danish dog family (199 individuals) of Groenendael and Tervueren with accumulated epilepsy. Epilepsy positive individuals (living and deceased) were ascertained through a telephone interview using a standardised questionnaire regarding seizure history and phenomenology. Living dogs were invited to a detailed clinical evaluation. Litters more than five years of age, or where epilepsy was present in all offspring before the age of five, were included in the calculations of inheritance. results: Out of 199 family members, 66 dogs suffered from epilepsy. The prevalence of epilepsy in the family was 33%. Fifty-five dogs experienced focal seizures with or without secondary generalisation, while four dogs experienced primary generalised seizures. In seven dogs, seizures could not be classified. The mode of inheritance of epilepsy was simple Mendelian. This study identified that the Belgian shepherd suffers from genetically transmitted focal epilepsy. The seizure phenomenology expressed by family members have a strong resemblance to what has been reported for familial partial (focal) epilepsy in humans with variable foci with suggestion of linkage to chromosome 2 and chromosome 22q12.

Altered expression of apoptotic factors and synaptic markers in postmortem brain from bipolar disorder patients. Bipolar disorder (BD) is a progressive psychiatric disorder characterized by recurrent changes of mood and is associated with cognitive decline. There is evidence of excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, upregulated arachidonic acid (AA) cascade signaling and brain atrophy in BD patients. These observations suggest that BD pathology may be associated with apoptosis as well as with disturbed synaptic function. To test this hypothesis, we measured mRNA and protein levels of the pro-apoptotic (Bax, BAD, caspase-9 and caspase-3) and anti-apoptotic factors (BDNF and Bcl-2) and of pre- and post-synaptic markers (synaptophysin and drebrin), in postmortem prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) from 10 BD patients and 10 age-matched controls. Consistent with the hypothesis, BD brains showed significant increases in protein and mRNA levels of the pro-apoptotic factors and significant decreases of levels of the anti-apoptotic factors and the synaptic markers, synaptophysin and drebrin. These differences may contribute to brain atrophy and progressive cognitive changes in BD.

The family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s): deciding between life and death of proteins. The family of ubiquitin-conjugating (E2) enzymes is characterized by the presence of a highly conserved ubiquitin-conjugating (UBC) domain. These domains accommodate the ATP-activated ubiquitin (Ub) or ubiquitin-like (UBL) protein via a covalently linked thioester onto its active-site residue. E2 enzymes act via selective protein-protein interactions with the E1 and E3 enzymes and connect activation to covalent modification. By doing so, E2s differentiate effects on downstream substrates, either with a single Ub/UBL molecule or as a chain. While E3s are involved in substrate selection, E2s are the main determinants for selection of the lysine to construct ubiquitin chains, which thereby directly control the cellular fate of the substrate. In humans, 35 active E2 enzymes have been identified so far, while other eukaryotic genomes harbor 16 to 35 E2 family members. Some E2s possess N- and/or C-terminal extensions that mediate E2-specific processes. During the past two decades, strong support has led to the control of E2 enzymes in decisions concerning the life or death of a protein. Here, we summarize current knowledge and recent developments on E2 enzymes with respect to structural characteristics and functions. From this we propose a shell-like model to rationalize the selectivity of these key enzymes in directing Ub/UBL-conjugation pathways.-Van Wijk, S. J. L., Timmers, H. T. M. The family of ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes (E2s): deciding between life and death of proteins.

Transmission efficacy and plasticity in glutamatergic synapses formed by excitatory interneurons of the substantia gelatinosa in the rat spinal cord. Substantia gelatinosa (SG, lamina II) is a spinal cord region where most unmyelinated primary afferents terminate and the central nociceptive processing begins. The glutamatergic excitatory interneurons (EINs) form the majority of the SG neuron population, but little is known about the mechanisms of signal processing in their synapses. To describe the functional organization and properties of excitatory synapses formed by SG EINs, we did non-invasive recordings from 183 pairs of monosynaptically connected neurons. An intact presynaptic SG EIN was specifically stimulated through the cell-attached pipette while the evoked EPSCs/EPSPs were recorded through perforated-patch from a postsynaptic neuron (laminae I-III). We found that the axon of an SG EIN forms multiple functional synapses on the dendrites of a postsynaptic neuron. In many cases, EPSPs evoked by stimulating an SG EIN were sufficient to elicit spikes in a postsynaptic neuron. EPSCs were carried through both Ca(2+)-permeable (CP) and Ca(2+)-impermeable (CI) AMPA receptors (AMPARs) and showed diverse forms of functional plasticity. The synaptic efficacy could be enhanced through both activation of silent synapses and strengthening of already active synapses. We have also found that a high input resistance (R(IN), >0.5 GOmega) of the postsynaptic neuron is necessary for resolving distal dendritic EPSCs/EPSPs and correct estimation of their efficacy. We conclude that the multiple synapses formed by an SG EIN on a postsynaptic neuron increase synaptic excitation and provide basis for diverse forms of plasticity. This functional organization can be important for sensory, i.e. nociceptive, processing in the spinal cord.

Haemorrhagic bullae associated with a chicken scratch. Complicated skin and soft tissue infection caused by a chicken scratch has rarely been reported. A 3-year-old boy who developed haemorrhagic bullae and necrotising fasciitis following a chicken scratch is reported. Morganella morganii and enterococci were cultured from the aspirate. He received antimicrobial treatment, surgical debridement and a skin graft, and recovered uneventfully.

Seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection and vector control activities in rural communities of the southern Gran Chaco (Argentina). We compared age-related seroprevalence of Trypanosoma cruzi infection with history of vector control interventions and social and ecological changes in three historically endemic departments of Cordoba province, Argentina, covering an area of 42,600 km(2) of the Gran Chaco region. Using a cross sectional design, blood samples of 5240 people between 6 months and 40 years of age, living in 192 rural communities were analyzed to detect T. cruzi infection using ELISA tests, and confirmed with indirect immunofluorescent antibody test and indirect haemoagglutination. Overall seroprevalence was 5.4%, 7.9% and 7.5% in the north, northwest and west studied areas (average for all areas 6.95%). Seroprevalence for T cruzi increased with population age, especially in age classes older than 15 years of age. Communities of the north and west areas showed 0.59% seroprevalence for T. cruzi in children below 15 years of age, whereas children of the same age in the northwest region showed a seroprevalence of 3.08%. Comparative analyses indicate that vector control activities and land use changes during the last decades are the most likely causes of the overall reduction of T. cruzi prevalence. Results suggest that the vectorial transmission of T. cruzi has been strongly reduced and probably interrupted in the north and west areas, but it is still active in the northwestern rural settlements of CÃ³rdoba province.

Impairment of the cortisol stress response mediated by the hypothalamus-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis in zebrafish (Danio rerio) exposed to monocrotophos pesticide. In teleosts, an important component of the stress response is coordinated by the hypothalamic-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis. Environmental contaminants might disrupt the stress axis and consequently affect the stress response in fish. To investigate the effect of monocrotophos (MCP) pesticide on the stress response of fish and its potential mechanisms, adult zebrafish (Danio rerio) were exposed to 0, 1, 10, and 100Î¼g/L of a 40% MCP-based pesticide for 21d, after which time fish were subjected to a 3-min air-exposure stressor. Concentrations of the whole-body cortisol were measured by radioimmunoassay and abundances of transcripts of proteins involved in the HPI axis were determined using quantitative real-time PCR. Results showed that 100Î¼g/L of MCP pesticide decreased whole-body cortisol levels of female zebrafish in response to an acute stressor, but without any effect on the cortisol response in males. 100Î¼g/L MCP pesticide reduced POMC and GR expression in the brain, MC2R and P45011Î² expression in the head kidney, but enhanced 20Î²-HSD2 expression in the head kidney, suggesting that MCP damaged the HPI axis involving acting at pituitary regulatory levels, inhibiting cortisol synthesis and stimulating cortisol catabolism, or disturbing the negative feedback regulation. Additionally, MCP depressed liver GR transcription but did not affect phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and tyrosine aminotransferase expression in zebrafish, suggesting a role for this pesticide in reducing target tissue responsiveness to cortisol. Considered together, the reduced ability to elevate cortisol levels in response to an acute stress may be an endocrine dysfunction occurring in zebrafish subchronically exposed to MCP pesticide. 

Dose response of caffeine on 2000-m rowing performance. To determine whether a dose-response relationship exists between caffeine and 2000-m rowing performance. In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study, 10 competitive male rowers (mean +/- SD: age = 20.6 +/- 1.4 yr, body mass = 87.7 +/- 10.5 kg, height = 186.8 +/- 6.8 cm, (.)VO2peak = 5.1 +/- 0.6 L x min(-1)) consumed 2, 4, or 6 mg x kg(-1) caffeine or a placebo 60 min before completing a 2000-m time trial on a rowing ergometer. The trials were preceded by a 24-h standardized diet (including a light preexercise meal of 2 g x kg(-1) CHO), and subjects were tested preexercise for hydration, caffeine abstinence, and blood glucose concentrations. Time trial performance was not significantly different across the three caffeine doses or placebo (P = 0.249). After the three caffeine trials, postexercise plasma glucose and lactate concentrations were higher compared with the placebo trial (P < 0.05). Plasma caffeine concentrations after 60 min of ingestion were lower than the values reported previously by others following the same dose, and there was considerable interindividual variation in plasma caffeine concentrations in response to the various caffeine doses. The large interindividual response to the caffeine doses suggests that individual characteristics need to be considered when administering caffeine for performance enhancement. In addition, preexercise feeding may significantly affect plasma caffeine concentrations and the potential for caffeine to improve performance.

C. pneumoniae community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in mimicking Mycoplasma pneumoniae meningoencephalitis complicated by asthma. Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniae is a common, non-zoonotic cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in ambulatory young adults. C. pneumoniae clinically presents as a mycoplasma-like illness frequently accompanied by laryngitis. C. pneumoniae CAP may also cause nursing home outbreaks in the elderly. Similar to Mycoplasma pneumoniae in immunocompetent hosts, C. pneumoniae CAP usually manifests as a mild/moderately severe CAP. In contrast with Legionnaire's disease, central nervous system involvement is usually not a feature of C. pneumoniae CAP. M. pneumoniae may rarely present with meningoencephalitis accompanied by high cold agglutinin titers. We present the case of a young man who presented with M. pneumoniae-like illness and was hospitalized for severe CAP that was accompanied by a pertussis-like cough and severe headache. Although his chest x-ray showed a right upper lobe infiltrate, a lumbar puncture was performed to rule out meningitis, but his cerebrospinal fluid profile was unremarkable. Titers for non-zoonotic atypical pneumonia pathogens were negative except for a highly elevated C. pneumoniae immunoglobulin-M titer (1:320). Testing for legionella and pertussis was negative. Q fever and adenoviral titers were also negative. Cold agglutinin titers were repeatedly negative. The patient was successfully treated with moxifloxacin but developed permanent asthma after C. pneumoniae CAP. This case is unusual in several aspects. First, C. pneumoniae usually presents as a mild to moderate CAP, but in this case it was severe. Second, hoarseness was absent, which would have suggested C. pneumoniae. Third, wheezing was an important clue to the diagnosis of C. pneumoniae, which is not a clinical finding with other causes of CAP. Fourth, permanent asthma may follow C. pneumoniae, as well as M. pneumoniae CAP. Fifth, severe headache mimicking M. pneumoniae meningoencephalitis may rarely accompany C. pneumoniae CAP.

Schizophrenia with impulsive and aggressive behaviors. Impulsive and aggressive behaviors are important clinical challenges in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. They occur both in the acute phase as well as in the chronic phase of the disorder and call for differentiated treatment interventions. It is important to always first consider behavioral and nonpharmacological interventions. High levels of structure and organization together with a nonconfrontational approach may be very successful interventions. In terms of acute pharmacological interventions, clinicians now have a broad spectrum of intramuscular antipsychotic compounds available with rapid onset of action and relatively little sedation. There is a need for new compounds with a more acceptable tolerability profile for the long-term treatment of these important syndromes.

The physiological function of lower urinary tract smooth muscle. The lower urinary tract is a muscular system composed of the urinary bladder and the outflow tract. During filling with urine the bladder is relaxed and the outflow tract offers a high resistance; during emptying the outflow resistance falls and the bladder wall generates a high wall tension to raise intravesical pressure. The coordination of these responses is organized in the brainstem and sacral spinal cord to control the activity of autonomic and somatic efferents to the smooth muscle of the bladder (detrusor) and the smooth and skeletal muscle of the bladder base and urethra. Detrusor contraction is predominantly controlled by parasympathetic fibres releasing acetylcholine and ATP; the outflow tract is controlled by parasympathetic and sympathetic fibres to the bladder base (trigone) and urethral smooth muscle (including a nitregic component) and somatic fibres to the urethral rhabdosphincter. The smooth muscles also develop spontaneous contractions that determine the tone of the musculature. The cellular signaling pathways that evoke contraction due to neurotransmitter release and the origin of spontaneous activity are discussed, as well as the electrical properties of the smooth muscle relevant to the propagation of electrical signals. Finally the interaction of muscle cells with other cell types (epithelium and interstitial cells) is considered, relevant to their ability to regulate muscle contractility. Throughout, the basic physiological processes are considered in relation to pathological developments that are prevalent in the human lower urinary tract, in particular the overactive bladder and urinary incontinence, and the identification of drug targets to manage these conditions.

[Mechanosensitivity of cationic channels of DEG/ENaC family]. The presented article is aimed to review modern insights into the possible role of epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) of the DEG/ENaC family in mechanosensitivity of cells. Contradictory results gained during previuos years at the study of native channels in the cells of renal epithelium and channels overexpressed in different model systems are discussed. The variety of methods used to reveal channel mechanosensity is specially reviewed. We have also focused our attention on the explanation of the functional role of mechanosensitivity in polarized kidney cells. The data reviewed allow us to conlude that ENaC is a mechanosensitive channel which is activated in response to laminar shear stress of renal epithelial cells. Possible molecular basis of the ENaC activation by shear forces is discussed.

Expand the pharyngitis paradigm for adolescents and young adults. Current guidelines and review articles emphasize that clinicians should consider group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus in the diagnosis and management of patients with acute pharyngitis. Recent data suggest that in adolescents and young adults (persons aged 15 to 24 years), Fusobacterium necrophorum causes endemic pharyngitis at a rate similar to that of group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus. On the basis of published epidemiologic data, F. necrophorum is estimated to cause the Lemierre syndrome-a life-threatening suppurative complication-at a higher incidence than that at which group A streptococcus causes acute rheumatic fever. Moreover, these estimates suggest greater morbidity and mortality from the Lemierre syndrome. The diagnostic paradigm for adolescent pharyngitis should therefore be expanded to consider F. necrophorum in addition to group A streptococcus. Expanding the pharyngitis paradigm will have several important implications. Further epidemiologic research is needed on both F. necrophorum pharyngitis (especially clinical presentation) and the Lemierre syndrome. Clinicians need reliable diagnostic techniques for F. necrophorum pharyngitis. In the meantime, adolescents and young adults who develop bacteremic symptoms should be aggressively treated with antibiotics for F. necrophorum infection. Physicians should avoid macrolides if they choose to treat streptococcus-negative pharyngitis empirically. Finally, pediatricians, internists, family physicians, and emergency department physicians should know the red flags for adolescent and young adult pharyngitis: worsening symptoms or neck swelling (especially unilateral neck swelling). Adolescent and young adult pharyngitis is more complicated than previously considered.

Parameter estimation in rational models of molecular biological systems. Based on statistical thermodynamics or Michaelis -Menten kinetics, molecular biological systems can be modeled by a system of nonlinear differential equations. The nonlinearity in the model stems from rational reaction rates whose numerator and denominator are linear in parameters. It is a nonlinear problem to estimate the parameters in such rational models of molecular biological systems. In principle, any nonlinear optimization methods such as Newton-Gauss method and its variants can be used to estimate parameters in the rational models. However, these methods may converge to a local minimum and be sensitive to the initial values. In this study, we propose a new method to estimate the parameters in the rational models of molecular biological systems. In the proposed method, the cost function in all parameters is first reduced to a cost function only in the parameters in the denominator by a separable theorem. Then the parameters in the denominator are estimated by minimizing this cost function using our proposed new iteration method. Finally, the parameters in the numerator are estimated by a well defined linear least squares formula. A simple gene regulatory system is used as an example to illustrate the performance of the proposed method. Simulation results show that the proposed method performs better than the general nonlinear optimization methods in terms of the running time, robustness (insensitivity) to the initial values, and the accuracy of estimates.

Mutations in the human naked cuticle homolog NKD1 found in colorectal cancer alter Wnt/Dvl/beta-catenin signaling. Mutation of Wnt signal antagonists Apc or Axin activates beta-catenin signaling in many cancers including the majority of human colorectal adenocarcinomas. The phenotype of apc or axin mutation in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster is strikingly similar to that caused by mutation in the segment-polarity gene, naked cuticle (nkd). Nkd inhibits Wnt signaling by binding to the Dishevelled (Dsh/Dvl) family of scaffold proteins that link Wnt receptor activation to beta-catenin accumulation and TCF-dependent transcription, but human NKD genes have yet to be directly implicated in cancer. We identify for the first time mutations in NKD1--one of two human nkd homologs--in a subset of DNA mismatch repair-deficient colorectal tumors that are not known to harbor mutations in other Wnt-pathway genes. The mutant Nkd1 proteins are defective at inhibiting Wnt signaling; in addition, the mutant Nkd1 proteins stabilize beta-catenin and promote cell proliferation, in part due to a reduced ability of each mutant Nkd1 protein to bind and destabilize Dvl proteins. Our data raise the hypothesis that specific NKD1 mutations promote Wnt-dependent tumorigenesis in a subset of DNA mismatch-repair-deficient colorectal adenocarcinomas and possibly other Wnt-signal driven human cancers.

Mopeia virus-related arenavirus in natal multimammate mice, Morogoro, Tanzania. A serosurvey involving 2,520 small mammals from Tanzania identified a hot spot of arenavirus circulation in Morogoro. Molecular screening detected a new arenavirus in Natal multimammate mice (Mastomys natalensis), Morogoro virus, related to Mopeia virus. Only a small percentage of mice carry Morogoro virus, although a large proportion shows specific antibodies.

The vasa vasorum in diseased and nondiseased arteries. The vasa vasorum form a network of microvasculature that originate primarily in the adventitial layer of large arteries. These vessels supply oxygen and nutrients to the outer layers of the arterial wall. The expansion of the vasa vasorum to the second order is associated with neovascularization related to progression of atherosclerosis. Immunohistological analysis of human plaques from autopsied aortas have defined plaque progression and show a significant correlation with vasa vasorum neovascularization. Recent technological advances in microcomputed tomography have enabled investigation of vasa vasorum structure and function in nondiseased large arteries from pigs and dogs. Smaller mammals, particularly mice with genetic modifications that enable disease development, have been used extensively to study the vasa vasorum in diseased vessels. Despite the fact that most mouse models that are used to study atherosclerosis are unable to develop plaque to the extent found in humans, studies in both humans and mice underscore the importance of angiogenic vasa vasorum in progression of atherosclerosis. Those who have examined the vasa vasorum in occluded vessels of nondiseased pigs and dogs find that inhibition of the vasa vasorum makes the animals atheroprone. Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial disease. There is increasing evidence that factors, produced in response to changes in the arterial wall, collaborate with the vasa vasorum to enhance the disease process.

Arctic plant origins and early formation of circumarctic distributions: a case study of the mountain sorrel, Oxyria digyna. Many plant species comprising the present-day Arctic flora are thought to have originated in the high mountains of North America and Eurasia, migrated northwards as global temperatures fell during the late Tertiary period, and thereafter attained a circumarctic distribution. However, supporting evidence for this hypothesis that provides a temporal framework for the origin, spread and initial attainment of a circumarctic distribution by an arctic plant is currently lacking. Here we examined the origin and initial formation of a circumarctic distribution of the arctic mountain sorrel (Oxyria digyna) by conducting a phylogeographic analysis of plastid and nuclear gene DNA variation. We provide evidence for an origin of this species in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau of southwestern China, followed by migration into Russia c. 11 million yr ago (Ma), eastwards into North America by c. 4Â Ma, and westwards into Western Europe by c. 1.96Â Ma. Thereafter, the species attained a circumarctic distribution by colonizing Greenland from both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Following the arrival of the species in North America and Europe, population sizes appear to have increased and then stabilized there over the last 1 million yr. However, in Greenland a marked reduction followed by an expansion in population size is indicated to have occurred during the Pleistocene.

Evolution of new variants of Vibrio cholerae O1. Vibrio cholerae typically contains a prophage that carries the genes encoding the cholera toxin, which is responsible for the major clinical symptoms of the disease. In recent years, new pathogenic variants of V. cholerae have emerged and spread throughout many Asian and African countries. These variants display a mixture of phenotypic and genotypic traits from the two main biotypes (known as 'classical' and 'El Tor'), suggesting that they are genetic hybrids. Classical and El Tor biotypes have been the most epidemiologically successful cholera strains during the past century, and it is believed that the new variants (which we call here 'atypical El Tor') are likely to develop successfully in a manner similar to these biotypes. Here, we describe recent advances in our understanding of the epidemiology and evolution of the atypical El Tor strains.

[Effects of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine on the amount of exosomes and secreted immuno-associated proteins by hepatoma cells]. To investigate the effects of 5-Aza-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) on the amount of exosomes and immuno-associated proteins produced in hepatoma HepG2 and Hep3B cells. Exosomes derived from HepG2 and Hep3B cells with or without treatment by 5-Aza-CdR were isolated and purified by combination of ultrafiltration centrifugation and sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. The number of exosomes was counted under the electron microscope. The concentration of proteins in exosomes was detected by BCA. The expression of HSP70, HLA-I and NY-ESO-1 proteins in exosomes was assayed by Western blot and immuno-electron microscopy. The mRNA expression of p53 gene was observed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The mRNA expression of p53 gene was increased in both hepatoma cell lines after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR. The number of exosomes and the concentration of total proteins in exosomes were significantly increased after treatment by 5-Aza-CdR (P < 0.05). The immuno-electron microscopy and Western blotting showed that after treatment with 5-Aza-CdR, the contents of HSP70, HLA-I and NY-ESO-1 proteins were increased in exosomes in both HepG2 and Hep3B hepatoma cells. 5-Aza-CdR, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, can increase the amount of exosomes and exosome-containning immuno-associated proteins secreted by hepatoma cells. It may be contributed by up-regulation of p53 gene and demethylation mechanism of 5-Aza-CdR.

Understanding externalizing behavior from children's personality and parenting characteristics. A total of 946 Japanese children in the 5th to 9th grades and their parents were studied in order to investigate the extent to which parenting characteristics (measured by the Parental Bonding Instrument) and the personality of the child (measured by the junior version of the Temperament and Character Inventory) would be associated with the two aspects of the externalizing problems--aggression and delinquency--of the child (measured by the Child Behavior Checklist). A series of regression analyses demonstrated that (1) aggressive children were higher in Novelty Seeking, and delinquent children were higher in Novelty Seeking and lower in Harm Avoidance, and (2) both aggressive and delinquent children were characterised by low maternal care, paternal over-protection, and low maternal overprotection. A structural equation model confirmed these findings except for the link between the two externalizing behaviour scores and the maternal care. Moreover, it was suggested that Novelty seeking of the child would be predicted by low parental care and low paternal and high maternal overprotection. The children's aggression and delinquency could, to some extent, be explainable by their temperament patterns and parental characteristics.

[A Case of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia with Adult-Onset Still's Disease-Like Erythema]. A 62-year-old woman developed B lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) in April 2010, and achieved complete remission after hyper-CVAD/high-dose-MA therapy combined with rituximab. ALL recurred in December 2011, and remission was again achieved with the Japan Adult Leukemia Study Group (JALSG) ALL202 protocol combined with rituximab. Owing to a fever and rash that persisted from July 2012, the patient was examined again. On examination, redness was observed in the pharynx, and poorly defined oval erythemas were seen on the cheeks, posterior region of the neck, and upper arms. Blood test results showed high levels of ferritin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, an d C-reactive protein (CRP), and mild hepatosplenomegaly was identified on abdominal computed tomography (CT), indicative of an adult-onset Still's disease-like condition. Prednisolone therapy was initiated in August 2012, and remission was achieved. A second recurrence of ALL developed in September 2012, and although remission was again achieved using the JALSG ALL202 protocol, a third recurrence of ALL occurred in April 2013, and the patient could not be saved. In this case, adult-onset Still's disease-like erythema developed during the remission phase of ALL.

Environmental and genetic correlates of allocation to sexual reproduction in the circumpolar plant Bistorta vivipara. â¢ Sexual reproduction often requires more energy and time than clonal reproduction. In marginal arctic conditions, species that can reproduce both sexually and clonally dominate. Plants with this capacity may thrive because they can alter reproduction depending on environmental conditions. Bistorta vivipara is a circumpolar herb that predominately reproduces clonally, but certain environmental conditions promote higher investment in flowers (and possible sexual reproduction). Despite largely reproducing clonally, the herb has high levels of genetic variation, and the processes underlying this paradoxical pattern of variation remain unclear. Here we identified environmental factors associated with sexual investment and examined whether sexual reproduction is associated with higher levels of genetic variation.â¢ We sampled 20 populations of B. vivipara across the high Arctic archipelago of Svalbard. In each population, we measured reproductive traits, environmental variables, and collected samples for genetic analyses. These samples permitted hypotheses to be tested regarding sexual investment and ecological and genetic correlates.â¢ Increased soil nitrogen and organic matter content and decreased elevation were positively associated with investment in flowers. Increased investment in flowers significantly correlated with more genotypes per population. Linkage disequilibrium was consistent with predominant clonality, but several populations showed higher genetic variation and lower differentiation than expected. There was no geographical genetic structure.â¢ In B. vivipara, sexual investment is positively associated with habitat quality. Bistorta vivipara predominantly reproduces clonally, but occasional outcrossing, efficient clonal reproduction, and dispersal by bulbils can explain the considerable genetic variation and weak genetic structure in B. vivipara.

[Possible mechanisms of peripheral elevated CD8+ IL-17+ T cells in rheumatoid arthritis]. To identify interleukin-17 (IL-17 )-producing CD8 positive T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and investigate its cytokines as well as their correlations. Peripheral blood got from 39 RA patients and 40 healthy donors. Flow cytometry was used to analyze the subsets of T cells in peripheral blood from these 39 RA patients and 27 healthy donors. 11-17, IL-6, and IL-23 levels in sera of all these people were tested by ELISA. The median of CD8 IL-17+ T cells from RA patients was 2.7% (95% confidence internal was 1.55%-3.74%); the median of these cells from healthy controls was 1.61% (95% confidence internal was 1.25%-2.61%). CD8+ IL-17+ T cells elevated significantly in RA(P < 0.05). As the production of CD8+ IL-17+ T cells, the IL-17 levels in sera of RA patients and healthy controls were (429 +/- 502) ng/L and (13 +/- 30) ng/L respectively. The IL-17 level in RA is higher than that in healthy people (P < 0.01). Meanwhile, to constitute CD8+ IL-17+ T cell polarizing condition, IL-23 and IL-6 in sera of RA were (157.83 +/- 27.07) ng/L and (32.67 +/- 34.50) x ng/L individually. These two cytokines in healthy controls were (21.97 +/- 3.52) ng/L and (1.82 +/- 1.51) ng/L severally. IL-6 and IL-23 increased clearly in peripheral blood of RA patients as compared with healthy donors (P < 0.01). This study suggested that elevated CD8+ IL-17+ T cells which involved in IL-17 secretion may depend on increased IL-6 and IL-23 in peripheral blood of rheumatoid arthritis.

Ultrasonography in patients with ulnar neuropathy at the elbow: comparison of cross-sectional area and swelling ratio with electrophysiological severity. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic value of ultrasonographic measurements in ulnar neuropathy at the elbow (UNE) and to assess the relationship between the measurements and the electrophysiological severity. The largest anteroposterior diameter (LAPD) and cross-sectional area (CSA) measurements of the ulnar nerve were noted at multiple levels along the arm, and the distal-to-proximal ratios were calculated. Almost all of the measurements and swelling ratios between patients and controls showed statistically significant differences. The largest CSA, distal/largest CSA ratio, CSA at the epicondyle, and proximal LAPD had larger areas under the curve than other measurements. The sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing UNE were 95% and 71% for the largest CSA, 83% and 85% for the distal/largest CSA ratio, 83% and 81% for the CSA at the epicondyle, and 93% and 43% for the proximal LAPD, respectively. There was a statistically significant correlation between the electrophysiological severity scale score (ESSS) and the largest CSA, the CSA at the epicondyle and 2 cm proximal to the epicondyle, and the LAPD at the level of the epicondyle (P < 0.05). None of the swelling ratios showed a significant correlation with the ESSS. The largest CSA measurement is the most valuable ultrasonographic measurement both for diagnosis and determining the severity of UNE.

[CAMDEX-R and dementia diagnosis in Brazil: translation and transcultural adaptation of the informant interview]. The Cambridge Examination for Mental Disorders of the Elderly - revised (CAMDEX-R) is an instrument developed in England and used as an aid to the diagnosis of dementia, mainly in its initial forms. It contains nine sections (named from A to I), including a neuropsychological evaluation and an interview with an informant (section H). This kind of interview has proved to be useful in the detection of dementia. To translate and transculturally adapt to Brazilian Portuguese the section H of CAMDEX-R. The section under study is a structured interview, composed by 130 items, applied to an informant aiming at diagnosing a demential state. The study was conducted by the universalist approach, with evaluation of conceptual, item, semantic and operational equivalences. Two independent translations into Portuguese were done by two bilingual Brazilians. Those were backtranslated into English by two bilingual Americans, also independently, without knowing the original version. From the translations, backtranslations and original text, another bilingual Brazilian suggested a synthesis-version. Based on the synthesis-version, a multidisciplinary group of two geriatricians and two gerontologists made the test-version with the transcultural adaptations needed. The test-version was used in the pre-test in the geriatric outpatient department of <<Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro>>, and it was carried out with twenty-five caregivers who were stimulated to comment and paraphrase the questions. The main focus was the items considered by the group of specialists to be of greater difficulty to adapt. The identified problems returned to the group of specialists, who produced the final-version then. The Portuguese version was made with some modifications to the literal translation, aiming at keeping a semantic equivalence to the original interview. The conceptual, item and semantic equivalences were considered established. The operational equivalence is in progress. The concern about our target population's low level of schooling was present during the whole transcultural adaptation process, leading us to choose more popular words. The Brazilian version of CAMDEX-R's Section H was considered suitable for daily clinical use.

No evidence of PGRN or MAPT gene dosage alterations in a collection of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Alterations in gene dosage have recently been associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, and deletions of the progranulin (PGRN) locus were recently described in patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). FTLD is a genetically complex neurodegenerative disorder with mutations in the PGRN and the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) genes being the most common known causes of familial FTLD. In this study, we investigated 39 patients with FTLD, previously found negative for mutations in PGRN and MAPT, for copy number alterations of these 2 genes. Gene dosage analysis of PGRN and MAPT was performed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. We did not identify any PGRN or MAPT gene dosage variations in the 39 FTLD patients investigated. We therefore conclude that alterations in gene copy number of PGRN and MAPT are not a cause of disease in this collection of FTLD patients.

Mania associated with antidepressant treatment: comprehensive meta-analytic review. To review available data pertaining to risk of mania-hypomania among bipolar (BPD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) patients with vs. without exposure to antidepressant drugs (ADs) and consider effects of mood stabilizers. Computerized searching yielded 73 reports (109 trials, 114 521 adult patients); 35 were suitable for random effects meta-analysis, and multivariate-regression modeling included all available trials to test for effects of trial design, AD type, and mood-stabilizer use. The overall risk of mania with/without ADs averaged 12.5%/7.5%. The AD-associated mania was more frequent in BPD than MDD patients, but increased more in MDD cases. Tricyclic antidepressants were riskier than serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SRIs); data for other types of ADs were inconclusive. Mood stabilizers had minor effects probably confounded by their preferential use in mania-prone patients. Use of ADs in adults with BPD or MDD was highly prevalent and moderately increased the risk of mania overall, with little protection by mood stabilizers.

Carboplatin and paclitaxel in combination with oral enzastaurin in advanced ovarian or primary peritoneal cancer: results from a safety lead-in study. This safety lead-in study examined the pharmacokinetic and adverse event profile of combining enzastaurin with paclitaxel plus carboplatin as first-line therapy for the treatment of advanced-stage ovarian cancer and primary peritoneal carcinoma. The specific objectives of this study were to assess safety and tolerability after 2 cycles of treatment, to determine if enzastaurin alters paclitaxel and carboplatin pharmacokinetics, and to determine if enzastaurin pharmacokinetics is affected by paclitaxel and carboplatin. After debulking surgery, patients with previously untreated epithelial ovarian or primary peritoneal carcinoma received sequential paclitaxel (175 mg/m) and carboplatin (area under the curve, 5 mg x min/mL) on day 1 every 3 weeks for 6 cycles. Patients ingested an oral loading dose of 1125 mg enzastaurin on day 4 of cycle 1, followed by oral 500-mg enzastaurin daily until the end of therapy. Adverse events were graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. There were 5 serious adverse events in 4 of 11 patients: soft tissue injury, wound infection, intestinal fistula, clostridial infection, and anemia. Coadministration with enzastaurin did not significantly alter paclitaxel and carboplatin pharmacokinetics (area under the curve ratio of treatment comparison asymptotically equal to 1.05 and 1.06, respectively). Enzastaurin exposures were unchanged (Cav,ss ratio of treatment comparison asymptotically equal to 0.95 for average steady-state total analyte concentrations of enzastaurin and its metabolite). Adding enzastaurin to paclitaxel plus carboplatin chemotherapy is feasible for advanced ovarian cancer after radical cytoreduction. Enzastaurin did not alter paclitaxel or carboplatin pharmacokinetics, and enzastaurin exposures were not significantly changed by carboplatin and paclitaxel.

Effects of clinical factors on psychosocial variables in renal transplant recipients. This paper is a report of a study investigating the effects of clinical factors (side effects of immunosuppressive medications, transplant-related hospitalizations, donor type, duration of dialysis before transplantation and time post-transplant) on cognitive appraisal of health, perceived self-efficacy, perceived social support, coping and health-related quality of life after renal transplantation. Some clinical factors such as hospitalizations, side effects of medications, donor type and dialysis, which influence the health-related quality of life of renal transplant recipients, have been investigated. However, the effects of these clinical factors on psychosocial variables after renal transplantation have not been well documented. Method. Using a descriptive cross-sectional design, a convenience sample of 160 renal transplant recipients was recruited (N = 55 < 1 year post-transplant; N = 105 1-3 years post-transplant) from May, 2005 to January, 2006. Standardized instruments were used to measure the key constructs. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to examine the effects of clinical factors on the psychosocial outcome measures. Participants reporting more (>17) immunosuppressive medication-associated side effects appraised their health more negatively, used more disengagement coping, had lower degrees of perceived self-efficacy, and reported lower physical and mental health-related quality of life than those with fewer symptoms (<or=17). Participants less than 1 year post-transplant used more engagement coping, reported higher degrees of perceived self-efficacy and perceived social support than participants in the later period post-transplant. Interventions aimed at alleviating bothersome medication side effects are needed to help these patients cope with transplantation and improve their health-related quality of life.

Effects of ethyl pyruvate and other Î±-keto carboxylic acid derivatives in a rat model of multivisceral ischemia and reperfusion. Ethyl pyruvate (EP) has been shown to ameliorate hepatic, renal, and intestinal mucosal injury and down-regulate expression of several pro-inflammatory mediators in a wide variety of preclinical models of critical illnesses, such as sepsis, burn injury, acute pancreatitis, stroke, and hemorrhagic shock. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the therapeutic effects of EP remain poorly understood, but might be related to the compound's structure as the ester of an Î±-keto carboxylic acid. Herein, we tested the hypothesis that EP and other Î±-keto carboxylic acid derivatives can modulate organ injury after lower torso ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). Rats were subjected to 50 min of supraceliac aortic occlusion. Over a 20-min period, starting 2 min before the release of the aortic clamp, the animals received 2 Î¼L/g of Ringer's lactate solution (RL, n = 5) or an equivalent volume of a solution containing EP (n = 5), benzoyl formate (BF, n = 5), parahydroxyphenyl pyruvate (PHPP, n = 5) or sodium pyruvate (NaPyr, n = 5). The total dose of each compound was 0.86 mMol/kg. After 1h of reperfusion, we measured ileal mucosal permeability to fluorescein-labeled dextran (mw 4000 Da), liver malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and TNF. Rats in the control group (CT, n = 4) were subjected to laparotomy and surgical isolation of the supraceliac aorta, but not visceral I/R. Ileal mucosal permeability, plasma levels of ALT and TNF, and hepatic MDA content increased significantly in the RL group relative to the CT group. Both EP and BF significantly ameliorated the development of systemic arterial hypotension, mucosal hyperpermeability, and significantly decreased plasma levels of TNF. MDA content was significantly decreased by EP, PHPP, BF, and NaPyr. In general, EP is more efficacious in this model than is NaPyr. Although more remains to be learned about the pharmacologic differences between EP and pyruvate, one important factor may the greater lipophilicity of the former compound. This insight may permit the development of even more effective cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory agents based on the pyruvoyl moiety.


Potential medical adverse events associated with death: a forensic pathology perspective.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics, maximum entropy production and Earth-system evolution. The present-day atmosphere is in a unique state far from thermodynamic equilibrium. This uniqueness is for instance reflected in the high concentration of molecular oxygen and the low relative humidity in the atmosphere. Given that the concentration of atmospheric oxygen has likely increased throughout Earth-system history, we can ask whether this trend can be generalized to a trend of Earth-system evolution that is directed away from thermodynamic equilibrium, why we would expect such a trend to take place and what it would imply for Earth-system evolution as a whole. The justification for such a trend could be found in the proposed general principle of maximum entropy production (MEP), which states that non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems maintain steady states at which entropy production is maximized. Here, I justify and demonstrate this application of MEP to the Earth at the planetary scale. I first describe the non-equilibrium thermodynamic nature of Earth-system processes and distinguish processes that drive the system's state away from equilibrium from those that are directed towards equilibrium. I formulate the interactions among these processes from a thermodynamic perspective and then connect them to a holistic view of the planetary thermodynamic state of the Earth system. In conclusion, non-equilibrium thermodynamics and MEP have the potential to provide a simple and holistic theory of Earth-system functioning. This theory can be used to derive overall evolutionary trends of the Earth's past, identify the role that life plays in driving thermodynamic states far from equilibrium, identify habitability in other planetary environments and evaluate human impacts on Earth-system functioning.


Increased expression of TLR7 in CD8(+) T cells leads to TLR7-mediated activation and accessory cell-dependent IFN-gamma production in HIV type 1 infection.

Cytology versus HPV testing for the detection of high-grade cervical lesions in women found positive on visual inspection in Mumbai, India. To compare the utility of cytology and HPV testing in women from Mumbai, India, suspected of having cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) on visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA), Lugol's iodine (VILI), or both. The sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of these tests for the detection of CIN 2 and/or 3 were evaluated in this cross-sectional study with 756 women suspected of having CIN on visual inspection. There were 25 women with CIN 2, 20 with CIN 3, and 21 with invasive cancer. The sensitivity to detect CIN 3 lesions was 85.0% (95% CI, 62.1-96.8) and 70.0% (95% CI, 45.7-88.1) for cytology testing at the ASCUS and LSIL thresholds, respectively, and it was 89.5% (95% CI, 66.9-98.7) for HPV testing. The specificity to detect CIN 3 lesions was 94.5% (95% CI, 92.5-96.1) and 96.1% (95% CI, 94.4-97.5) for cytology testing at the ASCUS and LSIL thresholds, and it was 91.1% (95% CI, 88.5-93.2) for HPV testing. Cytology and HPV testing were both found to be accurate triaging methods for women suspected of having CIN on visual inspection, especially for those with CIN 3 lesions.

Treatment options for threatened miscarriage. Threatened miscarriage, as demonstrated by vaginal bleeding with or without abdominal cramps, is a common complication of pregnancy. It occurs in about 20% of recognised pregnancies. Risk of miscarriage is increased in older women and those with a history of miscarriage. Low serum levels of progesterone or human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) are a risk factor for miscarriage. Other risk factors include heavy bleeding, early gestational age and an empty gestational sac of >15-17 mm diameter. Clinical history and examination, maternal serum biochemistry and ultrasound findings provide valuable information about the prognosis and are important to establish in order to determine potential treatment options. Although bed rest is the most common choice of treatment, there is little evidence of its value. Other options include luteal support with progesterone, dydrogesterone or hCG. There is some evidence from clinical studies indicating that progesterone or dydrogesterone may reduce the rate of miscarriage, although further data from double-blind, randomised-controlled trials are necessary to confirm efficacy.

Oral immunotherapy with inactivated nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae reduces severity of acute exacerbations in severe COPD. Acute exacerbations of COPD reflect in part an inappropriate host response to abnormal bacterial colonization. Orally administered inactivated nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) can drive a specific T-cell response that by promoting intrabronchial phagocytosis down-regulates bronchus inflammation. Subjects with recurrent exacerbations of COPD were studied in a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, to test efficacy of an NTHi oral immunotherapeutic (HI-164OV). This report describes the outcome in 38 subjects with severe COPD defined as having an FEV(1) < or = 50% of predicted normal. Exacerbations defined as an increase in volume and purulence of sputum were reduced by 16% (not significant) in the active group. However, moderate-to-severe exacerbations (defined as requiring corticosteroid therapy) were reduced by 63% (P = .05). The proportion with any acute exacerbation was little changed with treatment, but the proportion with episodes requiring corticosteroid therapy was reduced by 56% (P = .07). The mean duration of episodes was reduced by 37% (P = .01) and prescribed courses of antibiotics were reduced by 56% (P = .03) following therapy. Exacerbations requiring admission into hospital were reduced by 90% (P = .04) in the active group. No specific adverse effect was detected. Treatment of severe COPD with frequent exacerbations with HI-164OV was safe and effective, especially with respect to reduction in parameters of severity.

Nitro-Assisted BrÃ¸nsted Acid Catalysis: Application to a Challenging Catalytic Azidation.

Fetal heart rate patterns of pregnancies with vasa previa and velamentous cord insertion. To investigate the fetal heart rate (FHR) patterns in pregnancies complicated with vasa previa and velamentous cord insertion (VCI). A retrospective study comparing FHR patterns in pregnancies and subsequent pregnancies with/without VCI and in pregnancies with/without vasa previa was conducted. For each patient, FHR patterns were compared to the subsequent pregnancy. Deliveries occurred between the years 1988 and 2012 in a tertiary medical center. FHR patterns were evaluated according to the ACOG guidelines. During the study period, there were 184 pregnancies with VCI and 37 pregnancies with vasa previa, undetected during pregnancy. FHR patterns of the VCI group included more cases of abnormal baseline (7 vs. 2Â %, pÂ <Â 0.05), out of which 7Â % were fetal tachycardia (vs. 2Â %) and 4Â % were bradycardia (vs. 1Â %). There were also more cases of abnormal baseline and abnormal variability (7 vs. 2Â % and 32 vs. 22Â %, respectively, pÂ <Â 0.05) in the VCI group. FHR categories also differed between the velamentous cord insertion pregnancies and subsequent ones. VCI pregnancies had more category 2 patterns, not statistically significant (64 vs. 55Â %, pÂ =Â 0.11). FHR patterns of the vasa previa group included more cases of abnormal baseline (27 vs. 7Â %, pÂ <Â 0.05), out of which 18Â % were tachycardia and 9Â % were bradycardia. Decelerations were recorded in a total of 61Â % of the vasa previa cases (61 vs. 31Â %, pÂ =Â 0.02), most of which were variable decelerations (48 vs. 17Â %). Vasa previa pregnancies had more category 2 patterns (64 vs. 52Â %). Fetal heart rate patterns in pregnancies complicated with VCI or vasa previa have several non-specific pathological characteristics; none can be used for early detection of these conditions.

"Double wire" angio-seal closure technique after balloon aortic valvuloplasty. To report the feasibility of a collagen-mediated closure device using a modified Angio-Seal closure technique for access site management following percutaneous balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV). With the advent of percutaneous aortic valve replacement therapies, there has been a resurgence of interest in BAV procedures. Vascular complications, including bleeding, are a common source of morbidity post procedure as a result of the requirement for large bore femoral artery access. The use of vascular closure devices may reduce bleeding complications. We describe a new technique for vascular closure in this setting. At the conclusion of the valvuloplasty procedure, two 0.035'' wires are inserted through the femoral artery sheath. A conventional collagen-mediated closure device (8F Angio-Seal) is deployed over the first wire and along side the second wire. If immediate hemostasis is not achieved, a second device is loaded onto the second wire and deployed to achieve hemostasis. Percutaneous BAV was performed in 21 patients. Hemostasis was successfully achieved in all patients with either a single 8F Angio-Seal closure device (18 patients) or after placement of a second device (three patients). The modified "Double Wire" Angio-Seal technique is a feasible method for hemostasis following percutaneous BAV.

Bacterial meningitis: epidemiology, pathogenesis and management update.

Metabolism and tissue distribution of trace elements in broiler chickens' fed diets containing deficient and plethoric levels of copper, manganese, and zinc. Supplementation of broiler diets with copper, manganese, and zinc at levels higher than that stipulated by the National Research Council 1994 reportedly improved live weight, feed conversion, and cured leg abnormality supposedly caused by inadequate intake of Mn and Zn. The objective of the study was to ascertain the effects of plethoric supplementation of copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), and zinc (Zn) on performance and metabolic responses in broiler chickens. The study also aimed to discriminate the responses of the birds when the mineral elements were supplemented either in an inorganic or in an organic form. Cobb 400 broiler chickens (1-day old, n = 300) were assigned to three dietary treatments each containing nine replicates with ten birds for 39 days. The treatments included a control in which the diet was devoid of supplemental trace elements and treatments supplemented with an inorganic trace element premix (ITM) and supplemented with a combination of the inorganic and an organic trace element premix (OTM). The ITM contained (per kilogram) copper, 15 g; iron, 90 g; manganese, 90 g; zinc, 80 g (all as sulfated salts); iodine (as potassium iodide), 2 g; and selenium (as sodium selenite), 0.3 g. The OTM on the other hand, contained copper, 2.5 g; iron, 15 g; manganese, 15 g; zinc, 13.33 g; and chromium, 0.226 g (all as protein chelates). Plethoric supplementation of trace elements improved live weight gain and feed/gain ratio (p < 0.05). Leg abnormality developed in the 16% of the control group of birds but not in the supplemented group. Metabolizability of dry matter, organic matter, and protein was higher (p < 0.01) in the ITM and OTM groups. Excretion of Cu, Fe, and Zn decreased (p < 0.1) due to supplementation of the trace elements leading to increased apparent absorption of the said mineral elements (p < 0.01). Concentration of the concerned trace elements in serum, liver, and composite muscle samples was higher (p < 0.05) in the ITM and OTM dietary groups indicating an increased deposition of the said mineral elements due to supplementation. Although the study revealed subtle difference between the inorganic and organic mineral premixes with regards to the parameters mentioned above, it became apparent that it is possible to reduce excretion of these trace elements by a judicious escalation in the level of supplementation. The results of the present investigation further revealed that the trace mineral requirement of broiler chickens suggested by the National Research Council may not be optimum to support the maximum growth potential of the high yielding strains, and it is reasonable to consider a review of the current NRC recommendations to meet the needs of the modern birds.

Quality of life technology: the state of personal transportation. Motor vehicles are a technology that has been embedded in the built environment since the early 1900s. Personal transportation is important for the quality of life of individuals who have disabilities because it gives a feeling of freedom and enables individuals who have mobility impairments to participate in the community. This article describes the evaluation of individuals and their cognitive, sensory, and physical abilities that are important for (safe) driving. A case is made for independent mobility for individuals who have disabilities and elderly individuals by first giving an overview of the functional, cognitive, and sensory abilities that are critical for driving. Second, the types of vehicle modifications and state-of-the-art controls that are available and on the horizon are described and the way in which these technologies are selected to meet driver needs is explained. Requirements for driver safety systems for drivers who remain in their wheelchairs are then discussed. Finally, emerging and innovative driving enhancement systems, such as obstacle avoidance and navigation, are discussed, as are their benefits in helping drivers who have disabilities and elderly drivers to experience safe and independent driving.

Replacement of C305 in heart/muscle-type isozyme of human carnitine palmitoyltransferase I with aspartic acid and other amino acids. Liver- and heart/muscle-type isozymes of human carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (L- and M-CPTI, respectively) show a certain similarity in their amino acid sequences, and mutation studies on the conserved amino acids between these two isozymes often show essentially the same effects on their enzymatic properties. Earlier mutation studies on C305 in human M-CPTI and its counterpart residue, C304, in human L-CPTI showed distinct effects of the mutations, especially in the aspect of enzyme stability; however, simple comparison of these effects on the conserved Cys residue between L- and M-CPTI was difficult, because these studies were carried out using different expression systems and distinct amino acids as replacements. In the present study, we carried out mutation studies on the C305 in human M-CPTI using COS cells for the expression system. Our results showed that C305 was replaceable with aspartic acid but that substitution with other amino acids caused both loss of function and reduced expression.

Pain assessment in non-communicative patients: the Italian version of the Non-Communicative Patient's Pain Assessment Instrument (NOPPAIN). Although pain in the elderly is a common and important problem, it is frequently underestimated and undertreated. Pain assessment in elderly people is often more difficult than in the general population, because of the occurrence of dementia and other cognitive impairments that may compromise the ability to communicate the presence and the intensity of pain to hospital staff. Recently, several observational tools have been developed in order to assess pain behaviors in non-communicative patients. The aim of the present study was to verify if the Italian version of the Non- Communicative Patient's Pain Assessment Instrument (NOPPAIN) could be used in a hospital setting. Sixty severely demented patients (MMSE </=12, language test score </=3) and 42 cognitively intact ones (MMSE >/=23, language test score >/=4) were selected on the basis of their cognitive status and language skills. NOPPAIN forms were filled in at the same time by two nursing staff members after patients' daily care activities; behavioral indicators of the affective state and communicative patients' reports of pain were also collected. Significant interrater agreement was found in the subscores of the four main sections of the NOPPAIN and also in the total score. In addition, in cognitively intact patients there was a moderate (about 0.50) but significant correlation between NOPPAIN ratings and pain self-reports. A positive correlation between pain scores and negative affective state scores was also found, especially in cognitively impaired patients. The preliminary data of the present study support the reliability and validity of the Italian version of the NOPPAIN, which appears to be an easy-to-use tool in the assessment of pain in hospitalized non-communicative patients.

Solar energy powered microbial fuel cell with a reversible bioelectrode. The solar energy powered microbial fuel cell is an emerging technology for electricity generation via electrochemically active microorganisms fueled by solar energy via in situ photosynthesized metabolites from algae, cyanobacteria, or living higher plants. A general problem with microbial fuel cells is the pH membrane gradient which reduces cell voltage and power output. This problem is caused by acid production at the anode, alkaline production at the cathode, and the nonspecific proton exchange through the membrane. Here we report a solution for a new kind of solar energy powered microbial fuel cell via development of a reversible bioelectrode responsible for both biocatalyzed anodic and cathodic electron transfer. Anodic produced protons were used for the cathodic reduction reaction which held the formation of a pH membrane gradient. The microbial fuel cell continuously generated electricity and repeatedly reversed polarity dependent on aeration or solar energy exposure. Identified organisms within biocatalyzing biofilm of the reversible bioelectrode were algae, (cyano)bacteria and protozoa. These results encourage application of solar energy powered microbial fuel cells.

Pharmaceuticals from development to practice: learnings from an online curriculum. To report outcomes of a pilot online curriculum educating clinicians about off-label prescribing, finding unbiased sources of pharmaceutical information, and responding to patient inquiries about direct-to-consumer advertised medications. Case study. We developed 3 case-oriented Internet modules to educate healthcare professionals about off-label prescribing, accessing and appraising unbiased drug information, and talking with patients about direct-to-consumer advertising. Modules included reflective questions and opportunities to asynchronously ask questions of faculty. Pilot testing occurred among 52 Kaiser Permanente Colorado prescribing clinicians from May 2007 through September 2007. We assessed self-reported changes in knowledge, intent-to-change practice, and barriers to practice change. We also examined curriculum participant pre-post changes in prescribing of selected highly advertised medications. Most participants reported changes in knowledge after curriculum completion, many made intent-to-change practice statements at curriculum completion, and several reported changes in practice 3 to 6 months after curriculum completion. Six categories of barriers to practice change were noted. Prescribing of targeted medications rose by 0.8 prescription per month in the intervention group and by 6.3 prescriptions per month in the control group, but this difference was not significant (P = .17). Targeted curricula on aspects of the pharmaceutical development, approval, and marketing process can lead to subjective changes in clinician knowledge and can facilitate intent-to-change practice. Larger studies are needed to assess the effect of such interventions on prescribing patterns.

The passive distraction test: a new diagnostic aid for clinically significant superior labral pathology. The purpose of this report is to present a new provocative maneuver, the passive distraction test (PDT), as an examination tool to be used in the evaluation of patients thought to have a SLAP lesion and to compare its accuracy, precision, and reproducibility alone and in conjunction with previously published maneuvers. A retrospective analysis of 319 consecutive arthroscopies performed between May 2001 and November 2003 was performed. A total of 65 cases were excluded, 53 because of limitation of elevation to less than 150 degrees or pain in the starting test position and 12 who had previous shoulder procedures performed by the senior author, leaving 254 cases for review. A thorough history was obtained and a thorough physical examination performed with a focus on the involved shoulder including specific provocative maneuvers for the clinical diagnosis of a SLAP lesion. The active compression test, the anterior slide test, and the PDT were used to clinically diagnose a SLAP lesion. The results from the 3 provocative maneuvers were compared with the arthroscopic findings to determine the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value of each test alone and in a logical combination. Of 254 shoulder arthroscopies, 61 had a clinically significant SLAP lesion, for an incidence of 24%. The sensitivity and specificity for the PDT were 53% and 94%, respectively, with an NPV of 87% and positive predictive value of 72%. In combination, the PDT and the active compression test yielded an NPV of 90.5%. The PDT can be used alone or in combination to aid in the clinical evaluation and diagnosis of a SLAP lesion. Level IV, retrospective, diagnostic, sensitivity-specificity study.


Structure of laminin-binding adhesin (Lmb) from Streptococcus agalactiae.

Cardiac adrenergic control and atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and it causes substantial mortality. The autonomic nervous system, and particularly the adrenergic/cholinergic balance, has a profound influence on the occurrence of AF. Adrenergic stimulation from catecholamines can cause AF in patients. In human atrium, catecholamines can affect each of the electrophysiological mechanisms of AF initiation and/or maintenance. Catecholamines may produce membrane potential oscillations characteristic of afterdepolarisations, by increasing Ca(2+) current, [Ca(2+)](i) and consequent Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange, and may also enhance automaticity. Catecholamines might affect reentry, by altering excitability or conduction, rather than action potential terminal repolarisation or refractory period. However, which arrhythmia mechanisms predominate is unclear, and likely depends on cardiac pathology and adrenergic tone. Heart failure (HF), a major cause of AF, causes adrenergic activation and adaptational changes, remodelling, of atrial electrophysiology, Ca(2+) homeostasis, and adrenergic responses. Chronic AF also remodels these, but differently to HF. Myocardial infarction and AF cause neural remodelling that also may promote AF. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists (beta-blockers) are used in the treatment of AF, mainly to control the ventricular rate, by slowing atrioventricular conduction. beta-Blockers also reduce the incidence of AF, particularly in HF or after cardiac surgery, when adrenergic tone is high. Furthermore, the chronic treatment of patients with beta-blockers remodels the atria, with a potentially antiarrhythmic increase in the refractory period. Therefore, the suppression of AF by beta-blocker treatment may involve an attenuation of arrhythmic activity that is caused by increased [Ca(2+)](i), coupled with effects of adaptation to the treatment. An improved understanding of the involvement of the adrenergic system and its control in basic mechanisms of AF under differing cardiac pathologies might lead to better treatments.

[Projecting from the superior olivary complex to the inner ear in the cat: a retrograde fluorescent labelling study]. To investigate the distribution and projective feature of cat olivocochlear neurons. Eleven adult cats were divided into two groups randomly. The experimental group of eight cats was injected of 1% cholera toxin B (CTB) to the left cochlea, while injected of 5% fluoro gold (FG) to the right cochlea. The control group of three cats was injected of saline to bilateral cochlea. After a survival time of 7 days, serial frozen sections were cut in the cat brainstem. All the sections were processed by immunofluorescent procedure for CTB and FG, and the labeled olivocochlear neurons were observed by fluorescent microscope. In the experimental group, the mean total of olivocochlear neurons labeled by CTB and FG was 3210 +/- 168, including lateral olivocochlear neurons (LOC, 2298 +/- 120) and medial olivocochlear neurons (MOC, 913 +/- 64). The labeled neurons were divided into three different types according to their feature of projection: neurons which only projected to the ipsilateral cochlea, neurons which only projected to the contralateral cochlea, and double-labeled neurons which projected both to the ipsilateral and contralateral cochlea, but the double-labeled neurons comprised 3.9% and 15.1% in the LOC and MOC system respectively. No labeled neurons were found in the control group. There are three types of neurons in the cat olivocochlear system. The neurons which projected to the bilateral cochlea may distribute both in the LOC and MOC system.

Botulinum toxin for the correction of asymmetric crying facies. The clinical hallmark of asymmetric crying facies (ACF) is a symmetric appearance of the oral aperture and lips at rest, but significant depression of one side of the lower lip with animation (crying or smiling). ACF can resolve spontaneously in the first year of life, but surgical intervention may be required at some point to ensure a good cosmetic outcome. The authors report on the successful use of botulinum toxin type A to achieve temporary facial symmetry in two children with ACF with results lasting up to six months and suggest that such treatments may be helpful in providing more time to consider and/or plan surgical intervention.

Effect of biostimulation and bioaugmentation on degradation of polyurethane buried in soil. This work investigated biostimulation and bioaugmentation as strategies for removing polyurethane (PU) waste in soil. Soil microcosms were biostimulated with the PU dispersion agent "Impranil" and/or yeast extract or were bioaugmented with PU-degrading fungi, and the degradation of subsequently buried PU was determined. Fungal communities in the soil and colonizing buried PU were enumerated on solid media and were analyzed using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Biostimulation with yeast extract alone or in conjunction with Impranil increased PU degradation 62% compared to the degradation in untreated control soil and was associated with a 45% increase in putative PU degraders colonizing PU. Specific fungi were enriched in soil following biostimulation; however, few of these fungi colonized the surface of buried PU. Fungi used for soil bioaugmentation were cultivated on the surface of sterile wheat to form a mycelium-rich inoculum. Wheat, when added alone to soil, increased PU degradation by 28%, suggesting that wheat biomass had a biostimulating effect. Addition of wheat colonized with Nectria haematococca, Penicillium viridicatum, Penicillium ochrochloron, or an unidentified Mucormycotina sp. increased PU degradation a further 30 to 70%, suggesting that biostimulation and bioaugmentation were operating in concert to enhance PU degradation. Interestingly, few of the inoculated fungi could be detected by DGGE in the soil or on the surface of the PU 4 weeks after inoculation. Bioaugmentation did, however, increase the numbers of indigenous PU-degrading fungi and caused an inoculum-dependent change in the composition of the native fungal populations, which may explain the increased degradation observed. These results demonstrate that both biostimulation and bioaugmentation may be viable tools for the remediation of environments contaminated with polyurethane waste.

Infection studies with two highly pathogenic avian influenza strains (Vietnamese and Indonesian) in Pekin ducks (Anas platyrhynchos), with particular reference to clinical disease, tissue tropism and viral shedding. Pekin ducks were infected by the mucosal route (oral, nasal, ocular) with one of two strains of Eurasian lineage H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus: A/Muscovy duck/Vietnam/453/2004 and A/duck/Indramayu/BBVW/109/2006 (from Indonesia). Ducks were killed humanely on days 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7 after challenge, or whenever morbidity was severe enough to justify euthanasia. Morbidity was recorded by observation of clinical signs and cloacal temperatures; the disease was characterized by histopathology; tissue tropism was studied by immunohistochemistry and virus titration on tissue samples; and viral shedding patterns were determined by virus isolation and titration of oral and cloacal swabs. The Vietnamese strain caused severe morbidity with fever and depression; the Indonesian strain caused only transient fever. Both viruses had a predilection for a similar range of tissue types, but the quantity of tissue antigen and tissue virus titres were considerably higher with the Vietnamese strain. The Vietnamese strain caused severe myocarditis and skeletal myositis; both strains caused non-suppurative encephalitis and a range of other inflammatory reactions of varying severity. The principal epithelial tissue infected was that of the air sacs, but antigen was not abundant. Epithelium of the turbinates, trachea and bronchi had only rare infection with virus. Virus was shed from both the oral and cloacal routes; it was first detected 24 h after challenge and persisted until day 5 after challenge. The higher prevalence of virus from swabs from ducks infected with the Vietnamese strain indicates that this strain may be more adapted to ducks than the Indonesia strain.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors associated with neurofibromatosis type 1: report of two clinical cases. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a sarcoma with a high grade of malignancy originating in the nerve sheath components, fibroblasts, perineural cells, and Schwann cells. It is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) with a risk of 10-13%. We present two cases of NF-1-associated MPNST. The first patient presented moderate pain with no apparent cause, in addition to the presence of intraspinal lesion demonstrated by nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI), which was managed surgically on two occasions. Histologically, it corresponded to a neurofibromatosis lesion in transition with malignant neoplasm. The second case manifested with thoracic kyphoscoliosis, pain, and an increase in volume. Associated with the deformity, MRI showed a withering tumor in the posterior thoracic region (T1-T8), observing an infiltrating, cellular sarcomatous neoplasm with immunopositivity for S-100 protein and vimentin. MPNSTs are sarcomas with a high index of recurrence with the ability to produce distant metastasis during early stages. Despite wide resection, patients did not survive due to the advancement and size of the lesions (determining factors in the prognosis). Due to the progressive growth of MPNST and the anatomic difficulty for its approach, there should be strict surveillance of patients with NF-1 for early detection of malignant transformation in these lesions.

Classification of breathing events using load cells under the bed. Sleep disturbances are prevalent, financially taxing, and have a negative effect on health and quality of life. One of the most common sleep disturbances is obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) which frequently goes undiagnosed. The gold standard for diagnosing OSAHS is polysomnography (PSG)-a procedure that is inconvenient, time-consuming, and interferes with normal sleep patterns. We are investigating an alternative to PSG in which unobtrusive load cells fitted under the bed are used to monitor movement, heart rate, and respiration. In this paper we describe how load cell data can be used to distinguish between clinically relevant disordered breathing (apneas and hypopneas) and normal respiration. The method correctly classified disordered breathing segments with a sensitivity of 0.77 and a specificity of 0.91.

[Magnetic resonance imaging in patients with pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators: a systematic review]. The presence of a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator was historically considered a contraindication to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), due to the risks for both patient and device: reed-switch closure responsible for asynchronous pacing, inhibition of pacing, rapid ventricular pacing, heating on the lead tip or even device displacement... However, many recent studies demonstrate that if MRI is crucial for the management of the patient, it can be performed under specific monitoring and scanning conditions and after device reprogramming. The growing implication of device constructors in constructing a MRI safety device will perhaps extend in the future the indications of this imaging modality in implanted patients.


Fine-tuning of GPCR activity by receptor-interacting proteins.

Do we really know the outcomes of prolapse surgery? The exact success rate from conventional as well as new surgical procedures for pelvic organ prolapse is unknown possibly due to the lack of standardisation of outcome measures. Usually objective measures, e.g. Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POPQ) assessment have been used as the primary outcome in most studies which show that procedures such as anterior repair have a poor outcome. However these outcomes correlate poorly with subjective assessment and re-operation rates are lower than the anatomical failure rate suggesting that conventional surgery might not have as poor an outcome as previously suggested. Nonetheless, new procedures have been introduced for which efficacy and safety data are required via well conducted randomised controlled trials.

[Pelvic and spinal MR follow-up of multiple myeloma patients after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant]. To evaluate the changes of bone marrow lesions on pelvic and spinal MR in patients with multiple myeloma after high-dose chemotherapy and autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplant. Pelvic and spinal MR examinations were obtained at presentation (myeloma diagnosis) and 1 year after transplant in 20 patients that were part of a group of 39 patients enrolled in a prospective study. The type of marrow replacement (classified in stages with stage 0: normal; stage 1: salt and pepper; stage 2: focal infiltration; stage 3: diffuse infiltration), the number and size of marrow lesions and the number of vertebral compression fractures were recorded. We have compared the findings prior to and following transplant, with correlation to the response to treatment and the use of biphosphonates. The type of marrow replacement was improved following transplant in 65% of patients (not statistically significant). The number and size of nodules > 20 mm showed significant reduction (p = 0.0224 and p = 0.0237 respectively). Lesions on MR improved in 50% of patients with good response and 75% of patients with poor response to treatment. Patients receiving biphosphonates showed more vertebral compression fractures. The evolution of marrow replacing lesions on MR is discordant compared to the biological and clinical response to treatment. Pelvic and spinal MR evaluation at the time of diagnosis does not appear to be a good predictive factor of response to treatment. Biphosphonates do not appear to prevent new vertebral compression fractures. Pelvic and spinal MR provides interesting data in the follow-up of patients with myeloma following autologous transplant, especially in the local evolution of marrow replacing lesions, but our results do not justify its use in routine clinical practice.

Cadmium and copper inhibit both DNA repair activities of polynucleotide kinase. Human exposure to heavy metals is of increasing concern due to their well-documented toxicological and carcinogenic effects and rising environmental levels through industrial processes and pollution. It has been widely reported that such metals can be genotoxic by several modes of action including generation of reactive oxygen species and inhibition of DNA repair. However, although it has been observed that certain heavy metals can inhibit single strand break (SSB) rejoining, the effects of these metals on SSB end-processing enzymes has not previously been investigated. Accordingly, we have investigated the potential inhibition of polynucleotide kinase (PNK)-dependent single strand break repair by six metals: cadmium, cobalt, copper, nickel, lead and zinc. It was found that micromolar concentrations of cadmium and copper are able to inhibit the phosphatase and kinase activities of PNK in both human cell extracts and purified recombinant protein, while the other metals had no effect at the concentrations tested. The inhibition of PNK by environmentally and physiologically relevant concentrations of cadmium and copper suggests a novel means by which these toxic heavy metals may exert their carcinogenic and neurotoxic effects.

[Human enteroviruses and respiratory infections]. Enteroviruses (EV) (Picornaviridae) are common infectious agents divided into 4 species, including 108 serotypes and responsible for a wide range of human pathologies including upper and lower respiratory tract infections occurring in adults and infants. Recent clinical studies indicated that these viruses are considered as the third etiological cause of bronchiolitis in young infants aged 1-12 months. Moreover, several clinical case studies reported the etiological role of the coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16), the enterovirus 71 (EV-71) and of a newly discovered genotype (EV-104) in the development of acute or fatal pneumonia indicating that EV belonging to species A to C can be responsible for severe lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompetent infants or adults. Taking into account these recent epidemiological and clinical data and because of frequent mutations and intra-species enteroviral RNA genomic recombination events, the EV respiratory strains have to be considered as potential agents of further emerging infectious diseases in human populations.

Molecular analysis of gamma-globin promoters, HS-111 and 3'HS1, in beta-thalassemia intermedia patients associated with high levels of Hb F. The nucleotide (nt) variations in the promoter region of the gamma-globin genes, HS-111 and 3'HS1 regions, were studied in Iranian patients with beta-thalassemia intermedia (beta-TI), beta-thalassemia major (beta-TM) and healthy individuals. Of the five nt variations at the 5' end of the (A)gamma-globin gene, -369 (C>G), -611 (-T) and -603/604 (GA>AG) were found in all samples, whereas -588 (A>G) and -AAGC at -222 to -225 were found at different frequencies in the studied groups. Therefore, the -369, -611 and -603/604 variations were considered common mutations in this population, and the difference with respect to the -AAGC deletion was not significant. However, the A allele of the -588 variation and [+] allele of the XmnI polymorphism were more frequent in beta-TI patients, especially those who had the IVS-II-1(G>A)/IVS-II-1(G>A) genotype. The + allele of XmnI also had complete correlation with the A allele of -588 variation. The HS-111 (-21 A) variation also showed association with beta-TI patients who had high levels of Hb F. Bearing in mind that the -588 variation lies within the postulated adult-specific silencer region and that the majority of beta-TI patients had allele A, then it can be envisaged that this allele could have a role in altering the repressor function at this region. Therefore, the A allele of -588, [+] allele of XmnI and HS-111 (-21 A) variation are useful genetic markers to differentiate between beta-TM and beta-TI patients. However, these nt changes alone may not be the only elements raising the level of Hb F, other regulatory and modifying factors also play a role in Hb F production.

Nano-scale control of cellular environment to drive embryonic stem cells selfrenewal and fate.

Gaining new insights into food reward with functional neuroimaging. The notion that eating is intimately related to feelings of pleasure is not new. Indeed, in an environment characterised by many varied and palatable foods, hedonistic drives are likely to play a greater role in modulating food intake than homeostatic ones. Until recently however, a neurobiological account of the rewarding properties of food was lacking. The ability to reveal functional brain activity has been made possible with the advent of functional neuroimaging techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), positron emission tomography (PET) and most recently, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Neuroimaging studies in fed and fasted, lean and obese, normal and pathological states have revealed variations in food-related reward processing. Eating is a multi-sensory experience and understanding the precise mechanisms by which food modulates reward circuits will be important in understanding the aetiology of obesity and eating disorders. Here we review the development of functional neuroimaging as a research tool and recent neuroimaging studies relating to food reward. In particular, we evaluate the ability of leptin and the gut hormones peptide YY3-36 and ghrelin to modulate activity in reward-related brain regions. Finally, we discuss the potential to use such information to guide development of pharmaceuticals, functional foods and life-style modifications.

Intestinal volvulus with coagulative hepatic necrosis in a chicken. A 7-week-old SPF chicken inoculated at 4 weeks of age with chicken anemia virus was puffed up depressed and had ruffled feathers and a good body condition. Intestinal volvulus involving the jejunum and part of the duodenum forming two loops with one knob was observed. Microscopically, venous infarction of the obstructed loops, periportal and sublobular multifocal coagulative hepatic necrosis and granulomatous inflammation of the cecal tonsils were observed. Gram staining revealed no bacteria in hepatic tissue; however, gram-positive bacilli were detected in the necrotic debris in the intestinal lumen. Immunosuppression might have predisposed the chicken to intestinal and cecal tonsil infection that then progressed to volvulus. Loss of the mucosal barrier in infarction might allow bacterial toxins and vasoactive factors to escape into the systemic circulation (toxemia) and be responsible for the hepatic necrosis.

Breast cancer in very young women (<30 years): Correlation of imaging features with clinicopathological features and immunohistochemical subtypes. Early diagnosis of breast cancer in very young women (<30 years) is challenging and the characteristic imaging findings are not yet fully understood. We evaluated the imaging findings of breast cancer in very young women (<30 years) and to correlate them with clinicopathological features. A total of 50 surgically confirmed breast cancers were included in our retrospective study. The medical records were reviewed and the radiological features were analyzed according to the new 5th edition of the ACR BI-RADS lexicon. The breast cancers in our study population most commonly presented as a self-detected mass (74%), T2-3 stage (58%), histological grade III (52.3%) and ER-positive (80%) subtype. The most common finding was an irregular (87.5%) hyperdense (66.7%) mass with indistinct margins (50%) on mammography and an irregular (75.6%) indistinct (57.8%) hypoechoic/heterogeneous (77.8%) mass without a posterior acoustic feature (60%) on ultrasonography. MRI revealed an irregular shape (63.3%), irregular margins (43.3%), and heterogeneous enhancement (60%) with washout kinetics (69.4%). Mammographically, microcalcifications were correlated with the HER2-enriched type, and mass-type lesions were correlated with triple-negative cancer (p=0.04). An oval/round mass on ultrasound (p=0.005), rim enhancement (p=0.004) and intralesional T2 high signal intensity (p=0.04) on MRI were associated with the triple-negative type. On all imaging modalities, breast cancer in very young women usually presented as an irregular mass, and certain radiological features could be used for predicting the specific tumor type.

Quantified gene expression levels for phase I/II metabolizing enzyme and estrogen receptor levels in benign prostate from cohorts designated as high-risk (UK) versus low-risk (India) for adenocarcinoma at this organ site: a preliminary study. Risk of clinically significant prostate adenocarcinoma (CaP) varies worldwide, although there is a uniform prevalence of latent disease. A hormone-responsive tissue, the prostate possesses the metabolizing capacity to biotransform a variety of environmental procarcinogens or endogenous hormones. Whether such metabolizing capacity or estrogen receptor (ER) status underlies these demographic differences in susceptibility to CaP remains unclear. With appropriate ethical permission, verified-benign tissues were obtained following transurethral resection of the prostate from a high-risk region (n = 12 UK-resident Caucasians) and a typically low-risk region (n = 14 India-resident Asians). Quantitative gene expression analysis was employed for cytochrome P450 (CYP)1B1, N-acetyltransferase (NAT)1, NAT2, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT), sulfotransferase (SULT)1A1, ERalpha, ERbeta and aromatase (CYP19A1). To quantify the presence or absence of CYP1B1, ERalpha or ERbeta, and to identify their in situ localization, immunohistochemistry was carried out. The two cohorts had reasonably well-matched serum levels of prostate-specific antigen or hormones. Expression levels for the candidate genes investigated were similar. However, clear differences in protein levels for CYP1B1 and ERbeta were noted. Staining for CYP1B1 tended to be nuclear-associated in the basal glandular epithelial cells, and in UK-resident Caucasian tissues was present at a higher (P = 0.006) level compared with that from India-resident Asians. In contrast, a higher level of positive ERbeta staining was noted in prostates from India-resident Asians. These study findings point to differences in metabolizing capacity and ER status in benign prostate tissues that might modulate susceptibility to the emergence of clinically significant CaP in demographically distinct populations.

MR enterography in the management of patients with Crohn disease. Crohn disease is a complex pathologic process with an unpredictable lifelong course that includes frequent relapses. It often affects young patients, who are most vulnerable to the potential adverse effects of repeated exposure to ionizing radiation from computed tomography performed for diagnosis and surgical planning. The small intestine is the bowel segment that is most frequently affected, but it is the least accessible with endoscopic techniques. Magnetic resonance (MR) enterography has the potential to safely and noninvasively meet the imaging needs of patients with Crohn disease without exposing them to ionizing radiation. Appropriate use of MR enterography requires a carefully crafted protocol to depict signs of active inflammation as well as complications such as bowel obstruction, fistulas, and abscesses. Interpretation of MR enterographic images requires familiarity with the imaging signs and mimics of active bowel inflammation and stenosis. Although MR enterography currently is helpful for management in individual patients, the standardization of acquisition protocols and interpretive methods would increase its usefulness for more rigorous, systematic assessments of Crohn disease treatment regimens.

Entonox for labor pain: a randomized placebo controlled trial. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of nitrous oxide on pain of labor contractions and on maternal SaO2. The patients were randomized to receive either a pre-prepared mixture of 50% nitrous oxide and oxygen or 50% oxygen by a coin. Study drugs started as early as the onset of pain with each contraction. The patient herself administered gases via a facemask connected to the uni-directional valve which enables the patients to breathe fresh gas in each inspiration. The gas administration was continued to the end of contraction pain at which the patient breathed the room air. Variables such as SaO2, blood pressure, pain and side effects were recorded. 534 ASA I and II parturients, aged from 16 to 35 years, scheduled for elective labor from September 2004 to 2006 were evaluated. Four patients were lost from the study. The mean age of patients was 25.5+/-4.3 years. During the first three measurements, the SaO2 was significantly higher in control group. In addition, the mean arterial pressure was comparable between groups except two first measurements in which the control group was higher. All the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) values were significantly lower in nitrous oxide group. There were no significant differences in 1st and 5th min apgar scores between groups. All of the side effects were significantly higher among patients in nitrous oxide. In conclusion, our data indicate that using nitrous oxide 50% provides significant pain relief. Nonetheless, it is associated with few side effects, nitrous oxide can be quickly implemented during advanced painful labor.

Analysis of RR intervals time series of congestive heart failure patients with Higuchi's fractal dimension. We study time series of RR intervals of subjects with normal sinus rhythm (NSR) during sleep and wake phases and we also analyze time series of subjects with congestive heart failure (CHF) in both phases with the method of Higuchi's fractal dimension. We have found the presence of oscillations in the plots we have used to evaluate the Higuchi's fractal dimension; these oscillations seem to be associated with the appearance of periodicities in the time series of CHF patients in the sleep phase. These periodicities do not appear in all the six hours of the sleep phase, so this regular behavior is not observed in all sleep stages. It could be possible that patients that always show these periodicities are in worst condition, and it is possible that the disease worsens when periodicities appear in the Higuchi's graph.


Inter-DRG resource dynamics in a prospective payment system: a stochastic kernel approach.

Synthesis and examination of sulfated cyclofructans as a novel class of chiral selectors for CE. Cyclofructans (CFs) are a class of cyclic oligosaccharides with a crown ether skeleton. No enantioseparations have previously been reported using this class of chiral oligosaccharides in chromatography or electrophoresis. CFs and their sulfated derivatives were examined as chiral selectors using CE. The native CFs showed no enantioselectivity toward any tested compounds, while the sulfated CFs showed exceptional selectivity toward many cationic analytes, including primary, secondary, and tertiary amines and amino acids. Enantiomeric resolution factors as high as 15.4 were achieved within short analysis times (generally below 10 min). The effect of buffer type, buffer concentration, buffer pH, chiral selector concentration and organic modifier concentration was examined and optimized.

Modeling the need for hip and knee replacement surgery. Part 1. A two-stage cross-cohort approach. To explore inequalities in the need for hip/knee replacement surgery using a 2-stage cross-cohort approach. In the first stage, a small-area population-based survey, the Somerset and Avon Survey of Health, was used to provide a high-quality measure of need for hip/knee replacement using the New Zealand (NZ) score. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to validate a simplified NZ score, excluding information from clinical examination. In the second stage, a nationally representative population-based survey, the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing, was used to explore inequalities in need for hip/knee replacement using the simplified NZ score. Multilevel Poisson regression modeling was used to estimate rates of need for surgery. Exposures considered were age, sex, social class, ethnicity, obesity, Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004 deprivation quintiles, rurality, and ethnic mix of area. Rates of need for hip/knee replacement increase with age and are lower in men than in women (rate ratio [RR] 0.7, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.6-0.9 for hips; RR 0.8, 95% CI 0.7-1.0 for knees). Those of lowest social class have greater need. Need was greatest for people living in more deprived areas. Individual ethnic group did not predict the need for surgery. For hip replacement, there was no rurality effect; for knee replacement, those in town and fringe areas had greater need. Obesity was a strong predictor of need for surgery (RR 2.3, 95% CI 1.9-2.8 for hips; RR 2.4, 95% CI 2.0-2.8 for knees). This study provides evidence of greater variations of inequalities in need for hip/knee replacement than previous studies. Further research should explore geographic variation and produce small-area estimates of need to inform local health planning. It is important to complement data on need with willingness to undergo surgery.

[Association between HSV-2 infection and serum anti-rat brain antibodies in patients with autism]. Some cases of autism could be linked to viral infections able to induce autoimmune mechanisms directed against the encephalon. Neurothophic virus infections in animals are associated with clinical signs that are similar to those observed in neurodevelopment disorders. Thus, in this study, we determined the co-existence of antibodies against nerve tissue and viruses with neurothophic competence (HSV-1/2, Epstein-Barr-EBV, cytomegalovirus, measles and rubella) in serum of forty autistic children and forty healthy children. The presence of antibodies against nerve tissue was detected in slices of rat encephalic tissue by indirect immunofluorescence. The levels of anti-viral IgG and IgM antibodies were measured by indirect ELISA. The proportion of autistics with anti-encephalon IgG antibodies (77% anti-amygdala, 70% anti-caudate nucleus, 47.5% anti-cerebellum y anti-brain stem, 45% anti-hippocampus, 40% anti-corpus callosum and 17,5% anti-cortex) was significantly greater than that of controls (10% anti- amygdala y 5% anti- cerebellum) and was directly related to the severity of the autism. The proportion of children with positive levels (greater than 1.1.mg/dL) for anti-HSV IgM antibodies (indicative of acute infection) was significantly greater in autistics (65%) than in healthy children (17.5%). Ninety six percent of the autistics with anti-HSV antibodies also had anti-encephalon antibodies, percentage that was significantly greater than that of autistics negative to the anti-HSV-antibody (43%). In contrast, there were no significant differences for IgG and IgM antibodies for EBV, cytomegalovirus, measles and rubella. This suggests that autoimmunity against encephalic structures elicited by HSV infections could be involved in autism.

Emerging applications of fluorescence spectroscopy in medical microbiology field. There are many diagnostic techniques and methods available for diagnosis of medically important microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. But, almost all these techniques and methods have some limitations or inconvenience. Most of these techniques are laborious, time consuming and with chances of false positive or false negative results. It warrants the need of a diagnostic technique which can overcome these limitations and problems. At present, there is emerging trend to use Fluorescence spectroscopy as a diagnostic as well as research tool in many fields of medical sciences. Here, we will critically discuss research studies which propose that Fluorescence spectroscopy may be an excellent diagnostic as well as excellent research tool in medical microbiology field with high sensitivity and specificity.

[Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]. Heparin-induced thrombopenia (HIT) may occur as a complication of any type of heparin but is more frequently observed after administration of unfractioned heparins. Such a complication is scarce but potentially severe and may cause life-threatening thromboembolic and hemorrhagic disorders. Tow types of HIT are described. Type I HIT are of non immunologic origin. They have no clinical expression and spontaneously resolve after heparin therapy has been stopped. Type II HIT which are potentially severe and of immunologic origin, are related to the formation of a IgG-platelet factor 4 complex which activates platelets. They are characterized by an absolute or relative reduction of the platelet number observed on two successive assays. Once other causes of thrombopenia have been ruled out, the diagnostic relies on immunologic or functional tests evidencing the platelet anti-factor 4. Stopping heparin administration is mandatory and surrogate anti-thombotic measures must be instituted. An early diagnosis and an appropriate treatment of this complication result in a significant reduction of morbidity and mortality.


Common cold decreases lung function in infants with recurrent wheezing.

Unsuspected coagulopathy rarely prevents IV thrombolysis in acute ischemic stroke. American Heart Association/American Stroke Association guidelines recommend initiating treatment with IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) in acute ischemic stroke patients without suspected coagulopathy prior to availability of clotting results; however, little or no data support this practice. We sought to identify how often blood clotting abnormalities were responsible for withholding IV tPA at our institution. We conducted a retrospective review of our prospectively acquired Get With the Guidelines Stroke database from January 2003 to April 2008. All patients underwent clinical evaluation by a neurologist, diagnostic neuroimaging, and laboratory testing on admission. We classified patients with absolute contraindications to IV tPA as ineligible, and those with warnings/relative contraindications or potentially treatable factors as potentially eligible. Of 2,335 considered for analysis, 470 (20.1%) patients presented to our emergency department (ED) within 3 hours. Among these, 147 (31.3%) received IV tPA in our ED, 102 (21.7%) had an absolute contraindication, and 221 (47%) had a reason to consider withholding tPA. Only 30/470 (6.4%) of potential thrombolysis patients were discovered to have international normalized ratio > or =1.7 or platelets < or =100,000/microL, and of these, 28 were suspected a priori due to known coagulopathy from medication or illness. Only 2/470 (0.4%) patients had an unsuspected coagulopathy that ultimately prevented thrombolysis. Based on the experience of a large thrombolysis referral center, stroke patients without suspected clotting abnormality can safely begin thrombolytic therapy before clotting results are available. These data support the current practice guidelines, and may reassure clinicians that the benefits of early administration greatly outweigh the risks due to an unsuspected bleeding diathesis.


Genomic analysis distinguishes phases of early development of the mouse atrio-ventricular canal.

New data on biochemical mechanism of programmed senescence of organisms and antioxidant defense of mitochondria. Much evidence has recently been reported suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in mitochondria play a crucial role in the programmed senescence of organisms. In particular, it has been shown that antioxidants addressed to mitochondria slow down the appearance of symptoms of senescence and development of senile diseases and increase the median lifespan of various organisms from fungi to mammals. At the biochemical level, the mechanism of action of such rechargeable antioxidants as plastoquinonyldecyltriphenyl phosphonium (SkQ1) includes, in particular, prevention of oxidation of mitochondrial cardiolipin by ROS. The hormone melatonin also exhibits a number of such effects, and decrease in its level with age could explain the weakening of antioxidant protection upon aging. According to Moosmann et al., there exists a natural mechanism of antioxidant protection that, like SkQ1, is localized in the internal mitochondrial membrane and is rechargeable. It involves methionine residues in the surface regions of proteins encoded by mitochondrial DNA. It appears that in organisms with high respiratory metabolism the genetic code in the mitochondrial system of protein biosynthesis has changed. In these organisms (including some yeasts, insects, crustaceans, and vertebrates), the AUA codon codes for methionine rather than isoleucine, as in the case of synthesis of proteins encoded either in the nucleus or in mitochondria of organisms with lower rates of metabolism (other yeast species, sponges, and echinoderms). Methionine quenches ROS, being converted to methionine sulfoxide, which is re-reduced to the initial methionine by NADPH.


A unified diabatic description for electron transfer reactions, isomerization reactions, proton transfer reactions, and aromaticity.

Stem cells are units of natural selection for tissue formation, for germline development, and in cancer development. It is obvious that natural selection operates at the level of individuals and collections of individuals. Nearly two decades ago we showed that in multi-individual colonies of protochordate colonial tunicates sharing a blood circulation, there exists an exchange of somatic stem cells and germline stem cells, resulting in somatic chimeras and stem cell competitions for gonadal niches. Stem cells are unlike other cells in the body in that they alone self-renew, so that they form clones that are perpetuated for the life of the organism. Stem cell competitions have allowed the emergence of competitive somatic and germline stem cell clones. Highly successful germline stem cells usually outcompete less successful competitors both in the gonads of the genotype partner from which they arise and in the gonads of the natural parabiotic partners. Therefore, natural selection also operates at the level of germline stem cell clones. In the colonial tunicate Botryllus schlosseri the formation of natural parabionts is prevented by a single-locus highly polymorphic histocompatibility gene called Botryllus histocompatibility factor. This limits germline stem cell predation to kin, as the locus has hundreds of alleles. We show that in mice germline stem cells compete for gonad niches, and in mice and humans, blood-forming stem cells also compete for bone marrow niches. We show that the clonal progression from blood-forming stem cells to acute leukemias by successive genetic and epigenetic events in blood stem cells also involves competition and selection between clones and propose that this is a general theme in cancer. 


[Proangiogenic cell-based therapy for treatment of ischemic diseases].

UHRF1 is associated with epigenetic silencing of BRCA1 in sporadic breast cancer. BRCA1 is closely related to the pathogenesis of breast cancer, BRCA1 mRNA is reduced in sporadic breast cancer cells despite the lack of mutations. In the present report, we found that overexpression of UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like, containing PHD and RING finger domains 1) was closely related to DNA methylation, deacetylation, and methylation of histones, recruitment of an inhibiting transcriptional complex on the BRCA1 promoter in sporadic breast cancer. Overexpression of UHRF1 induced deacetylation of histones H3 and H4, which was facilitated by recruitment of histone deacetylase1 (HDAC1) to the BRCA1 promoter. Loss of acetylation was accompanied by loss of binding of the key transcription factors MyoD, CBP, and p300. UHRF1 also recruited histone lysine methyltransferase G9a to the BRCA1 promoter and histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) was demethylated, and histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) was methylated. Finally, overexpression of UHRF1 leaded to methylation of BRCA1 promoter by recruitment of DNMT1 to the BRCA1 promoter, locking in marked suppression of BRCA1. It is the first to describe that UHRF1 is responsible for regulating BRCA1 transcription by inducing DNA methylation, histone modifications, and recruitment of transcriptional complex on the BRCA1 promoter, UHRF1 is a new bio-marker in sporadic breast cancer.

Ambivalent effects of compound C (dorsomorphin) on inflammatory response in LPS-stimulated rat primary microglial cultures. It was proven that compound C displays beneficial effects in models of inflammatory-induced anemia, ischemic stroke, and fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva. Compound C influence on microglia, playing a major role in neuroinflammation, has not been evaluated yet. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of compound C on cytokine release, NO, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The rat microglial cultures were obtained by shaking the primary mixed glial cultures. Cytokine and nitrite concentrations were assayed using ELISA kits. ROS were assayed with nitroblue tetrazolium chloride. AMPK activity was assayed using the SAMS peptide. The expression of arginase I, NF-kappaB p65, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) was evaluated using Western blot. Compound C displayed ambivalent effect depending on microglia basal activity. It up-regulated the release of TNF alpha and NO production and increased the expression of arginase I in non-stimulated microglia. However, compound C down-regulated IL-1 beta, IL-6 and TNF alpha release, NO, ROS production, and AMPK activity, diminished NF-kappaB and HIF-1 alpha expression, as well as increased arginase I expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia. Compound C did not affect iNOS expression and IL-10 and TGF-beta release in non-stimulated and LPS-stimulated microglia. The observed alterations in the release or production of inflammatory mediators may be explained by the changes in NF-kappaB, HIF-1 alpha, and arginase I expression and 3-(4,5-dimethylthazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolinum bromide values in response to LPS, whereas the basis for the compound C effect on non-stimulated microglia remains to be investigated.

Intrathoracic splenosis: evaluation by superparamagnetic iron oxide-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and radionuclide scintigraphy. Splenosis represents the heterotopic autotransplantation of splenic tissue after either splenic trauma or surgery. Intrathoracic splenosis is a rare condition resulting from concomitant rupture of the spleen and the left hemidiaphragm. We report a case of splenosis in a 41-year-old male patient who had experienced severe thoracoabdominal injury including rupture of the spleen and left hemidiaphragm and post-traumatic splenectomy 20 years previously. Abnormal opacities in the cardiac region were noted on a chest radiograph at an annual checkup. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest demonstrated multiple, well-circumscribed pleura-based nodules at the posterior base of the left hemithorax and the left subdiaphragmatic area. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the lesions were hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. After administration of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO), the lesions showed decreased signal intensity but remained slightly hyperintense relative to liver parenchyma on T2-weighted images. (99m)Tc-labeled Sn colloid scintigraphy revealed multiple areas of increased activity consistent with the lesions on the CT and MRI scans. In addition to the history of splenic trauma and left hemothorax, SPIO-enhanced MRI and radionuclide scintigraphy, which can demonstrate phagocytic ability in the ectopic splenic tissue, were useful for confirming the diagnosis.

Guidewire versus conventional contrast cannulation of the common bile duct for the prevention of post-ERCP pancreatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis. The use of a guidewire (GW) for cannulation of the bile duct during ERCP may prevent post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP). A systematic review and meta-analysis of GW-guided versus conventional contrast (CC)-guided bile duct cannulation for the prevention PEP. A November 2008 search of gray literature, databases, reference lists, and meeting abstracts was conducted for randomized, controlled trials comparing GW and CC. Two independent reviewers extracted the data. The outcomes included PEP, primary cannulation success, and other adverse events. From 2132 citations, 7 randomized, controlled trials (5 noncrossover trials and 2 crossover trials) were included. Among noncrossover trials only, there was significant reduction in PEP when using a GW (3.2%) compared with CC (8.7%) (relative risk [RR] 0.38; 95% CI, 0.19-0.76). Subgroup analysis showed a significantly lower occurrence of PEP after GW entry versus CC injection of the pancreatic duct (1.1% vs 9.5%; RR 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06-0.58). Among patients with a precut sphincterotomy from a failed primary cannulation, there was less PEP with GW cannulation compared with CC (2.4% vs 21.7%; RR 0.21; 95% CI, 0.04-1.04). The other adverse event rates were comparable between GW and CC groups (2% vs 2%; RR 1.05; 95% CI, 0.39-2.83). Primary cannulation success was significantly greater with GW use compared with CC (89% vs 78%; RR 1.19; 95% CI, 1.05-1.35). ERCP GW cannulation reduces the risk of PEP compared with the use of CC. GW cannulation is associated with a higher cannulation success rate and less PEP after pancreatic duct entry.

Molecular identification of enteroviruses including two new types (EV-98 and EV-107) isolated from Japanese travellers from Asian countries. Of 58 enterovirus strains isolated from Japanese travellers returning from Asian countries, eight were non-serotypable with existing antisera. By sequencing a part of the VP1 region, six of these strains were typed as echovirus 9, enterovirus (EV)-73, EV-79 or EV-97. The nucleotide identity of the VP1 region of isolate T92-1499 to all enterovirus prototypes was <70 %. The VP1 sequence of isolate TN94-0349 was closely related to coxsackievirus (CV)-A9 (73.3 % nucleotide identity), but the virus could not be neutralized with a serum raised against the prototype CV-A9 strain. On the basis of complete molecular comparisons, T92-1499 and TN94-0349 were identified as EV-98 and EV-107, respectively, by the ICTV Picornavirus Study Group. Serum neutralization tests of Japanese individuals revealed a seroprevalence rate of 11 % for EV-73, and even lower seroprevalence rates, 1.0-3.8 %, were found for the other new enteroviruses, suggesting that prior circulation of these viruses in Japan was unlikely.

Pathogenicity of IgG subclass autoantibodies to type VII collagen: induction of dermal-epidermal separation. In different autoimmune diseases, tissue damage is mediated by the Fc portion of autoantibodies. These include autoimmunity to type VII collagen, a major hemidesmosomal skin constituent, where autoantibodies activate both complement and leukocytes, leading to separation within the dermal-epidermal junction. Fc-dependent effector functions differ among IgG subclasses. To elucidate the still controversial role of IgG subclasses in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity to type VII collagen, we generated a unique set of V gene-matched recombinant chimeric anti-type VII collagen autoantibodies of the four human IgG subclasses. Binding specificities and avidities of all four autoantibodies were comparable. Using ex vivo models, our results demonstrate that a monoclonal autoantibody is sufficient to activate complement and to induce dermal-epidermal separation. However, only IgG1 and IgG3, but not IgG2 and IgG4 against type VII collagen, were pathogenic in our ex vivo model systems. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a full-length recombinant disease-related human autoantibody has been investigated. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of recombinant antibody technology to dissect the contribution of F(ab')(2) and Fc portions of autoantibodies to their biological effects. These findings may eventually contribute to novel diagnostic tools for monitoring disease and to the development of more specific therapies in autoantibody-mediated diseases, i.e. the generation of subclass-specific adsorbers, used for extracorporal immunoapheresis, or the shifting of the autoimmune response to production of non-pathogenic autoantibodies.

To evaluate the performance of MIRUs (mycobacterial interspersed repetitive units) genotyping alone, IS6110-RFLP (IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism) genotyping alone and their combination applied in the molecular epidemiological study of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) isolates circulating in rural China. A cross-sectional study was designed to collect MTB isolates from the TB patients registered in local TB dispensaries of Deqing county and Guanyun county from 2004 to 2005. The proportion method was used to determine drug susceptibility of MTB isolates to the first line anti-TB drugs (isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol and streptomycin). The Beijing family of MTB was identified by Spoligotyping. All isolates were genotyped by MIRUs alone, IS6110-RFLP alone and their combination. Of the 351 studied MTB isolates, 243 (69.2%) had the genotypes that belonged to the Beijing family, and 223 (63.5%) were resistant to at least 1 anti-TB drug, including 53 (15.1%) resistant to isoniazid and rifampin simultaneously or multidrug resistant (MDR). The heterogeneity of 12 MIRUs loci differed from 0.76 in MIRU26 to 0.003 in MIRU2. MIRUs alone identified 235 genotypes (HGI = 0.9317), including 46 "clusters" containing 162 isolates and 189 "unique" pattern/isolates. Thirty-eight isolates comprised the largest MIRUs defined cluster and presented MIRUs type 2233 2517 3533. MIRUs based clusters were further identified by IS6110-RFLP into 28 subgroups containing 80 isolates (HGI = 0.9989). In comparison, IS6110-RFLP determined 267 genotypes from all isolates, including 46 "clusters" containing 130 isolates (HGI = 0.9684) and 221 "unique" pattern/isolates. All the 46 IS6110-RFLP defined clusters could also be further identified by MIRUs into 31 subgroups (HGI = 0.9992). The performance of MIRUs prior to IS6110-RFLP combination was comparable to that of IS6110-RFLP prior to MIRUs combination, especially in Beijing genotype strain (HGI: 0.9930 vs 0.9933) and MDR-TB strains (HGI: 0.9965 vs 0.9963). For feasibility, cost and discriminatory power, MIRUs prior to IS6110-RFLP combination is more suitable for the massive epidemiological investigation of MTB in rural China.


Mental workload classification using heart rate metrics.

Short peptides allowing preferential detection of Candida albicans hyphae. Whereas the detection of pathogens via recognition of surface structures by specific antibodies and various types of antibody mimics is frequently described, the applicability of short linear peptides as sensor molecules or diagnostic tools is less well-known. We selected peptides which were previously reported to bind to recombinant S. cerevisiae cells, expressing members of the C. albicans Agglutinin-Like-Sequence (ALS) cell wall protein family. We slightly modified amino acid sequences to evaluate peptide sequence properties influencing binding to C. albicans cells. Among the selected peptides, decamer peptides with an "AP"-N-terminus were superior to shorter peptides. The new decamer peptide FBP4 stained viable C. albicans cells more efficiently in their mature hyphal form than in their yeast form. Moreover, it allowed distinction of C. albicans from other related Candida spp. and could thus be the basis for the development of a useful tool for the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis. 

Functional variation of the dopamine D2 receptor gene is associated with emotional control as well as brain activity and connectivity during emotion processing in humans. Personality traits related to emotion processing are, at least in part, heritable and genetically determined. Dopamine D(2) receptor signaling is involved in modulation of emotional behavior and activity of associated brain regions such as the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex. An intronic single nucleotide polymorphism within the D(2) receptor gene (DRD2) (rs1076560, guanine > thymine or G > T) shifts splicing of the two protein isoforms (D(2) short, mainly presynaptic, and D(2) long) and has been associated with modulation of memory performance and brain activity. Here, our aim was to investigate the association of DRD2 rs1076560 genotype with personality traits of emotional stability and with brain physiology during processing of emotionally relevant stimuli. DRD2 genotype and Big Five Questionnaire scores were evaluated in 134 healthy subjects demonstrating that GG subjects have reduced "emotion control" compared with GT subjects. Functional magnetic resonance imaging in a sample of 24 individuals indicated greater amygdala activity during implicit processing and greater dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) response during explicit processing of facial emotional stimuli in GG subjects compared with GT. Other results also demonstrate an interaction between DRD2 genotype and facial emotional expression on functional connectivity of both amygdala and dorsolateral prefrontal regions with overlapping medial prefrontal areas. Moreover, rs1076560 genotype is associated with differential relationships between amygdala/DLPFC functional connectivity and emotion control scores. These results suggest that genetically determined D(2) signaling may explain part of personality traits related to emotion processing and individual variability in specific brain responses to emotionally relevant inputs.

Dynamics of hydrated polyurethane biomaterials: Surface microphase restructuring, protein activity and platelet adhesion. Microphase separation is a central feature of segmented polyurethane biomaterials and contributes to the biological response to these materials. In this study we utilized atomic force microscopy (AFM) to study the dynamic restructuring of three polyurethanes having soft segment chemistries of interest in biomedical applications. For each of the materials we followed the changes in near surface mechanical properties during hydration, as well as fibrinogen activity and platelet adhesion on these surfaces. Both AFM phase imaging and force mode analysis demonstrated that these polyurethane biomaterials underwent reorientation and rearrangement resulting in a net enrichment of hard domains at the surface. Fibrinogen activity and platelet adhesion on the polyurethane surfaces were found to decrease with increasing hydration time. The findings suggest that water-induced enrichment of hydrophilic hard domains at the surface changes the local surface physical and chemical properties in a way that influences the conformation of fibrinogen, changing the availability of the platelet-binding sites in the protein. This work demonstrates that the hydrated polyurethane biomaterial interface is a complex and dynamic environment where the surface chemistry is changing, altering the activity of fibrinogen and affecting blood platelet adhesion.

Antagonistic factors control the unproductive splicing of SC35 terminal intron. Alternative splicing is regulated in part by variations in the relative concentrations of a variety of factors, including serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins. The SR protein SC35 self-regulates its expression by stimulating unproductive splicing events in the 3' untranslated region of its own pre-mRNA. Using various minigene constructs containing the terminal retained intron and flanking exons, we identified in the highly conserved last exon a number of exonic splicing enhancer elements responding specifically to SC35, and showed an inverse correlation between affinity of SC35 and enhancer strength. The enhancer region, which is included in a long stem loop, also contains repressor elements, and is recognized by other RNA-binding proteins, notably hnRNP H protein and TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43). Finally, in vitro and in cellulo experiments indicated that hnRNP H and TDP-43 antagonize the binding of SC35 to the terminal exon and specifically repress the use of SC35 terminal 3' splice site. Our study provides new information about the molecular mechanisms of SC35-mediated splicing activation. It also highlights the existence of a complex network of self- and cross-regulatory mechanisms between splicing regulators, which controls their homeostasis and offers many ways of modulating their concentration in response to the cellular environment.


Effects of olive leaf extract and its main component oleuroepin on acute ultraviolet B irradiation-induced skin changes in C57BL/6J mice.

Assessment of air pollutant emissions from the Akrotiri landfill site (Chania, Greece). Air pollutants emitted from landfills affect air quality, contribute to the greenhouse effect and may cause serious problems to human health under certain circumstances. The current study was focused on the determination of air emissions from the Akrotiri landfill site which is located in the Akrotiri area (Chania, Greece). The landfill consists of two phases, phase A (first phase) which is currently closed (operational between 2003 and 2007) and phase B (second phase, operation between 2007 and (foreseen) 2013). Three different emission models (the EPA LandGEM model, the triangular model and the stoichiometric model) were used for the quantification of emissions. The LandGEM 3.02 software was further adopted and used in conjunction with the long-term dispersion model ISC3-LT for the evaluation of the dispersion of gaseous chemical components from the landfill. The emission and meteorological conditions under which the models were applied were based on the worst-case emission scenario. Furthermore, the concentration of hydrogen sulfide, vinyl chloride and benzene were determined in and around the landfill site. The concentrations of hydrogen sulfide and benzene were calculated to be far below the limit value proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for human health safety. However, the vinyl chloride concentrations were above the WHO reference lifetime exposure health criteria for the phase B area.


Deletions and point mutations of LRRC50 cause primary ciliary dyskinesia due to dynein arm defects.

A new technique for reconstruction of the middle hepatic vein without graft interposition: "the digging technique". Ill-located liver metastases close to the cavo-hepatic confluence often require resection and reconstruction of hepatic veins. However, most of the current techniques for reconstruction of the hepatic veins require graft interposition or complex venoplasty. The present case report describes a new surgical procedure which allows reconstructing the middle hepatic vein (MHV) by direct end-to-end anastomosis after a right hepatectomy for colorectal liver metastases invading the right and middle hepatic veins. This technique is called the "digging technique", in which an additional atypical resection of a part of segment 4a "digging" around the distal end of the MHV in order to further mobilize the liver and to achieve, with an upward lifting of the remnant liver, a tension-free end-to-end reconstruction of the MHV. The immediate postoperative course was uneventful. After 6 months of follow-up the patient was well and the MHV was patent. In selected patients with liver metastases close to the MHV-inferior vena cava confluence, requiring a right hepatectomy, the "digging technique" allows a safe direct end-to-end anastomosis avoiding graft interposition.

CC-chemokine ligand 18/pulmonary activation-regulated chemokine expression in the CNS with special reference to traumatic brain injuries and neoplastic disorders. Pulmonary activation-regulated chemokine (PARC) now designated CC-chemokine ligand 18 (CCL18) has been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of various tissue injuries and diseases in a proinflammatory or immune suppressive way to limit or support the inflammation or disease. While much is known about the roles of CCL18/PARC in non-neural tissues, its expression in the CNS has remained largely unexplored and controversial. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and double immunohistochemical staining, we analyzed the expression of CCL18/PARC in the human brain with special reference to traumatic brain injuries and tumors. The RT-PCR analysis revealed the expression of CCL18/PARC mRNA both in the traumatic brain and glioma tissues examined. Immunoexpression of CCL18/PARC protein was consistently detected in all cases of traumatic brain injuries examined by immunohistochemical staining. Double immunofluorescence labeling has extended the study that CCL18/PARC positive cells were macrophages/microglia, astrocytes or neurons. The CCL18/PARC expression was localized in macrophage-like cells in two of eight glioblastoma tissues whose cancer cells were CCL18/PARC negative. Unexpectedly, CCL18/PARC mRNA weakly and constitutively expressed by glioblastoma cell line was upregulated after endotoxin stimulation. The present results indicated a significant production of CCL18/PARC in different CNS traumatic and neoplasm tissues by specific cellular elements expressing the chemokine. An anti-inflammatory mechanism jointly exerted by these cells via CCL18/PARC may be involved in the CNS immunity after traumatic injury and tumorigenesis.

Coding of on-line and pre-planned movement sequences.

Comparison of the efficiencies of three neural induction protocols in human adipose stromal cells. The aim of this study was to compare the neural differentiation potential and the expression of neurotrophic factors (NTFs) in differentiated adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) using three established induction protocols, serum free (Protocol 1), chemical reagents (Protocol 2), and spontaneous (Protocol 3) protocols. Protocol 1 produced the highest percentage of mature neural-like cells (MAP2ab(+)). Protocol 2 showed the highest percentage of immature neural-like cells (beta-tubulin III(+)), but the neural-like state was transient and reversible. Protocol 3 caused ADSCs to differentiate spontaneously into immature neural-like cells, but not into mature neural cell types. The neural-like cells produced by Protocol 1 lived the longest in culture with little cell death, but Protocol 2 and 3 led to the significant cell death. Therefore, Protocol 1 is the most efficient among these protocols. Additionally, soon after differentiation, the mRNA levels of nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in dADSCs were sharply decreased by Protocol 1 and 2 (acute induction protocol), but not by Protocol 3 (chronic induction protocol). The results indicate that NTFs played an important role in neural differentiation via acute responses to NGF and BDNF, but not chronically during the transdifferentiation process.

Childhood abuse uncovered in a palliative care audit.

Automatic detection of sleep macrostructure based on bed sensors. This study analyses the spectral components of the heart rate fluctuations of a new contact-less technology for sleep evaluation. Both heart beat interval (HBI) and movement activity were extracted from the multichannel ballistocardiographic (BCG) measurements, based on Emfit sensor foils placed into bed mattress. Powers spectral densities (PSD) of HBI have been compared with the ones obtained from the standard ECG during sleep stage 2. In addition, spectral features obtained from the contact-less technology and standard ECG has been used to automatically classify the sleep macrostructure through a time-varying autoregressive model and a Hidden Markov Model. Whole night recordings from six subjects were analyzed in this study. Spectral components did not show significant differences between the two measurements. Further, contactless technology achieved a total accuracy of 83 % and kappa index of 0.42, while standard ECG achieved an accuracy of 84 % and kappa index of 0.43 when compared to clinical sleep staging from polysomnography.

Aging alters the perception and physiological representation of frequency: evidence from human frequency-following response recordings. Older adults, even with clinically normal hearing sensitivity, have auditory perceptual deficits relative to their younger counterparts. This difficulty may in part, be related to a decline in the neural representation of frequency. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of age on behavioral and physiological measures of frequency representation. Thirty two adults (ages 22-77), with hearing thresholds 25 dB HL at octave frequencies 0.25-8.0 kHz, participated in this experiment. Frequency discrimination difference limens (FDLs) were obtained at 500 and 1000 Hz using a two-interval, two-alternative forced choice procedure. Linear regression analyses showed significant declines in FDLs at both frequencies as age increased. Frequency-following responses (FFRs) were elicited by 500 and 1000 Hz tonebursts, as well as at frequencies within and outside those FDLs. Linear regression of FFR phase coherence and FFR amplitude at frequencies at and slightly below 1000 Hz showed significant decreases as age increased. Therefore, pitch discrimination, as measured by FDLs, and neural representation of frequency, as reflected by FFR, declined as age increased. Although perception and neural representation concurrently declined, one was not predictive of the other.

Counseling in fetal medicine: evidence-based answers to clinical questions on morbidly adherent placenta. Although the incidence of morbidly adherent placenta (MAP) has risen progressively in the last two decades, there remains uncertainty about the diagnosis and management of this condition. The aim of this review is to provide up-to-date and evidence-based answers to common clinical questions regarding the diagnosis and management of MAP. Different risk factors have been associated with MAP; however, previous Cesarean section and placenta previa are the most frequently associated. Ultrasound is the primary method for diagnosing MAP and has a good overall diagnostic accuracy for its detection. When considering the different ultrasound signs of MAP, color Doppler seems to provide the best diagnostic performance. Magnetic resonance imaging has the same accuracy in diagnosing MAP as does ultrasound examination; its use should be considered when a resective procedure, such as hysterectomy, is planned as it can provide detailed information about the topography of placental invasion and predict difficulties that may arise in surgery. The optimal gestational age for delivery in pregnancies with MAP is yet to be established; planning surgery between 34 and 36âweeks of gestation provides the best balance between fetal maturity and the risk of unexpected episodes of heavy bleeding, which are more likely to occur with delivery after this timepoint, especially in severe cases of MAP. The optimal surgical approach to MAP depends on multiple factors, including availability of an experienced team, specific surgical skills and hospital resources. Copyright Â© 2015 ISUOG.

An empirical study for medication delivery improvement based on healthcare professionals' perceptions of medication delivery system.

Rationale and evidence for menu-labeling legislation. Menu-labeling legislation is a proposed public health intervention for poor diet and obesity that requires chain restaurants to provide nutrition information on menus and menu boards. The restaurant industry has strongly opposed menu-labeling legislation. Using scientific evidence, this paper counters industry arguments against menu labeling by demonstrating that consumers want chain restaurant nutrition information to be disclosed; the current methods of providing nutrition information are inadequate; the expense of providing nutrition information is minimal; the government has the legal right to mandate disclosure of information; consumers have the right to know nutrition information; a lack of information reduces the efficiency of a market economy; and menu labeling has the potential to make a positive public health impact.

Effects of clozapine on behavioral sensitization induced by cocaine. Using cocaine-sensitized mice as a model for psychosis, this study investigated whether subchronic treatment with clozapine could affect the sensitized state of the animals and examined the accompanying molecular changes in the brain. To induce sensitization, ICR mice (n=44) were treated with cocaine for 5 days. After 7 days of withdrawal, sensitization was confirmed by a cocaine challenge. Then, the sensitized animals were treated with clozapine for 5 days and rechallenged with cocaine. The frontal cortices were removed from the mice (n=16) 24 h after the last challenge, and the phosphorylation status of some key signaling molecules was investigated. Compared with the sensitized mice receiving the vehicle treatment, the sensitized mice receiving subchronic clozapine showed less locomotor activity, with an activity level similar to that of non-sensitized mice. However, clozapine did not directly affect the stimulatory effect of cocaine. Clozapine also reversed some of the sensitization-induced biochemical changes, including increased phosphorylation of GSK-3beta and CREB, in the frontal cortex. Subchronic treatment with clozapine apparently de-sensitized the sensitized mice. The long-term effect of clozapine on stimulant-induced sensitization may be related to the therapeutic effect of the drug as an antipsychotic agent.


Agitation and pain assessment using digital imaging.

Non-surgical management of paraesthesia and pain associated with endodontic sealer extrusion into the mandibular canal. The aim of this report was to present a case of endodontic sealer extrusion into the mandibular canal in a 42-year-old woman. The patient was referred to the Endodontology and Stomatology Clinics, School of Dentistry, EstÃ¡cio de SÃ¡ University, complaining of 5-day duration intense spontaneous pain and paraesthesia, both arising after an endodontic intervention. Conventional radiographs and computed tomography of the mandible showed the presence of radiopacities inside the right mandibular canal. History and these radiographs confirmed extrusion of endodontic sealer. Treatment included an anti-inflammatory drug, completion of endodontic treatment and follow up. The patient reported gradual improvement, becoming asymptomatic after 2 months. Radiographs 30 months after initial examination revealed partial resorption of the foreign material. In conclusion, iatrogenic extrusion of endodontic materials should be included in differential diagnosis of endodontic pain and can sometimes be managed through non-surgical interventions in some cases.


Elevated Plasma Soluble CD14 Levels Correlate with the Monocyte Response Status During Hantaan Virus Infection in Humans.

Treatment persistence and compliance with a combination of calcium and vitamin D. The persistence and compliance of patients in Spain with calcium and vitamin D supplementation are unknown, and thus the purpose of the present study was to determine the current figures. This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study. Throughout Spain, 1342 primary-care physicians and specialists were asked to recruit 7888 patients aged 45 years or over, who had been prescribed with a calcium and vitamin D combination (CaVitD) at least 1 year prior to the study. Data on biodemographics, the reason for prescription and fracture risk factors were collected. Persistence with treatment, reasons for discontinuation, and compliance among persistent patients were assessed and patients' profiles analyzed. From the recruited sample, a total of 7624 patients were finally analyzed. Most subjects were postmenopausal (mean age 65.7âÂ±â9.4 years). The main reason for CaVitD prescription was osteoporosis (56.3%), started 2-5 years earlier. A family history of osteoporosis (41.4%) and previous fractures (40.7%) occurred frequently in the patients' clinical histories. At the study visit, 27.7% had discontinued CaVitD treatment, the main reason being fatigue due to the long-term treatment. Just 31.2% of persistent patients were adherent. Non-persistent patients were more likely to be smokers, alcohol consumers, have a long immobilization history, malabsorption syndrome and previous bone fractures. Only two in ten patients effectively comply with CaVitD treatment after 1 year or more of its prescription.

Serum antibody responses to Wolbachia surface protein in patients with human lymphatic filariasis. Wolbachia surface protein (WSP), which is the most abundantly expressed protein of Wolbachia from the human filarial parasite Brugia malayi, was chosen for the present study. B-cell epitope prediction of the WSP protein sequence indicates a high antigenicity, surface probability and hydrophilicity by DNA STAR software analysis. ProPred analysis suggests the presence of HLA class II binding regions in the WSP protein that contribute to T-cell responses and isotype reactivity. In order to validate these findings, the gene coding for endosymbiont WSP was PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA of the human filarial parasite Brugia malayi and cloned in T-7 expression vector pRSET-A. Western blot and ELISA at the total IgG level with recombiant WSP indicated a significantly elevated reactivity in CP compared to MF, EN and NEN individuals. Isotype ELISA also suggested an elevated reactivity in CP patients at the IgG1 level. In contrast, WSP-specific IgG4 levels were found to be elevated in MF patients compared to CP and EN. Besides this, WSP-specific IgE levels indicated an elevated reactivity in CP and MF patients compared to normals. Observations from ELISA supported the in silico predictions that indicate the presence of B- and T-cell epitopes. Hence, a combinatorial approach of in silico predictions and wet-lab studies provides interesting insights into the role of Wolbachia proteins in filarial pathogenesis.

A device to measure oxygen consumption during the hypothermic perfusion of the liver. This work deals with the construction and performance of a device designed to measure the oxygen consumption by the liver during hypothermic perfusion in the rat model. Due to its simple design and the utilization of standard materials, it could serve to determine the role of oxygenation during hypothermic perfusion of the liver. The system consists of a reservoir containing the preservation solution, a peristaltic pump and an internal oxygenator made of silicone tube. A five ports manifold connects the circulation to the liver (inflow), to a hydrostatic manometer and to two sample ports; the liver outflow and temperature sensor or gas calibration. Finally the exit port connects the circulation fluid with an oxygen electrode. The preservation solution is pumped through the liver at a constant pressure (77 i 15 mm H2O) and a perfusion flow of 0.39 - 0.49 mL per min per g liver. To test the system, two to four hours perfusion experiments were performed, at temperatures of 5 and 10 degree C. Two preservation solutions were evaluated: Custodiol and Bes-Gluconate-Sucrose. The solubility of oxygen in the preservation solutions was determined, and the oxygen consumption by preserved rat livers was measured.

Novel complex gel beads composed of hydrolyzed polyacrylamide and chitosan: an effective adsorbent for the removal of heavy metal from aqueous solution. A novel kind of complex gel beads containing HPAM (hydrolyzed polyacrylamide) and chitosan components (HPAM-chitosan gel beads) was prepared and applied in the removal of Cu(2+), Pb(2+), and Hg(2+) ions from aqueous solutions. These gel beads exhibited a good performance for heavy metal removal. Moreover, the average diameter of these gel beads was about 1mm, which could be appropriate for use in column system. The removal order was Pb(2+)>Cu(2+)>Hg(2+) under the same conditions. The effects of different experimental parameters, such as adsorbent dosage, initial pH, temperature, and initial metal concentration, on the adsorption capacities were studied. The Freundlich model gave a better fit to the experimental data than the Langmuir model in adsorption isotherm study. Desorption study indicated that the gel beads were easy to be regenerated.

[Enhancing effect of tissue engineered bone on bone defect repair in rats]. To evaluate the effects of composite bone in strategy of tissue engineering on bone defect repair in rats. Sixteen matured Wistar rats (male or female, weighing 250-300 g) were used to prepare platelet lysate (PL). PL/allogeneic decalcified bone granules (ADBG)/Col I (PAC) and ADBG/Col I (AC) were prepared by mixing Col I gel ADBG with or without PL. BMSCs of 8 Wistar rats (male or female, weighing 250-300 g) were isolated and cultured. The 5th passage of BMSCs were co-cultured with PAC at the density of 1 x 10(6) cells/mL to fabricate the tissue engineered composite PACB in vitro. Forty healthy Wistar rats were made bilateral bone defects in femoral condyles and divided into 4 groups (A, B, C and D, n=10). The defects were filled with equivalent PACB, PAC, AC and Col I in groups A, B, C and D respectively. At 4 weeks, the defect repair was evaluated with radiology, histology, ALP biochemical tests. At 4 weeks, the bone density measurement was (7.31 +/- 0.54), (4.36 +/- 0.67), (2.12 +/- 0.47), and (1.09 +/- 0.55) pixels in groups A, B, C, and D, respectively. The area of new bone formation in defect area under single view was (412.82 +/- 22.31), (266.57 +/- 17.22), (94.34 +/- 20.22), and (26.12 +/- 12.51) pixels in groups A, B, C and D respectively. The ALP contents in femoral condyles were (94.31 +/- 7.54), (69.88 +/- 4.12), (41.33 +/- 3.46), and (21.03 +/- 3.11) U/L, respectively. The above indexes of group A were significantly higher than those of groups B, C or D (P < 0.05). Three-color flow cytometry assay showed that the T lymphocyte subsets of CD3(+)CD4(+)CD8(-), CD3(+)CD8(+)CD4(-), and the ratio of CD4/CD8 displayed no significant difference among four groups (P > 0.05). Tissue engineered bone PACB is capable to promote the bone defect repair.

Translation, cross-cultural adaption and validation of the German version of the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure for patients with chronic ankle instability. The evaluation of health-related quality of life and physical function is important for determining therapeutic strategies following ankle injuries. The Anglo-American Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM) is a valid and reliable self-reported measure to detect functional deficits in chronic lateral ankle instability. The purpose of this study was to translate, cross-culturally adapt and validate the FAAM questionnaire for use with German-speaking patients with chronic lateral ankle instability. Preoperative and conservatively treated patients with chronic lateral ankle instability. Sport students and volleyball athletes served as control groups. The FAAM was forward and back translated, cross-culturally adapted and validated. The study population completed the FAAM-G questionnaire twice within 3-5 days. Additionally, the patients were scored with the Good ankle laxity classification system. Test-Retest reliability, construct validity and internal consistency were calculated. Reliability and validity of the FAAM-G were examined in presurgical chronic ankle instability patients (n=24), conservatively treated chronic ankle instability patients (n=17), university sport students (n=31) and volleyballers (n=37). Test-retest reliability revealed fair, good, or excellent reliability (inter-class correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.590-0.998; Ï=0.528-1.000). Construct validity, tested between the FAAM-G subscores and the Good et al ankle laxity classification system demonstrated strong correlations (Ï = -0.819 to -0.861). The original FAAM questionnaire was successfully translated and cross-culturally adapted from English to German. Corresponding to the Anglo-American version, the FAAM-G is a reliable and valid questionnaire for self-reported assessment of pain and disability in German-speaking patients suffering from chronic ankle instability.

The role of radiotherapy alone in patients with merkel cell carcinoma: reporting the Australian experience of 43 patients. To review the role of radiotherapy (RTx) alone in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC). The records of 43 patients with MCC treated with RTx alone between 1993 and 2007 at the Westmead and Royal Brisbane/Mater Hospitals, Australia, were reviewed. Multivariate analysis was performed by use of Cox regression analysis. The median age was 79 years (range, 48-91 years) in 19 women (44%) and 24 men (56%). All patients were white, and 5 (12%) had immunosuppression. A majority (56%) underwent irradiation at initial diagnosis, with the remainder (44%) treated in the relapse setting. The median duration of follow-up was 39 months. The head and neck comprised the most frequently treated site (47%). The median maximum lesion size was 30 mm (range, 5-130 mm). Relapse developed in 60% of patients, with most being out-of-field relapses. The in-field control rate was 75%. Most out-of-field relapses were to visceral organs. Relapse developed outside the irradiated field in 53% of patients. On multivariate analysis, only nodal status (negative nodes vs. nodes present) was significantly associated with relapse-free survival, with p = 0.005 (hazard ratio, 0.25; 95% confidence interval, 0.96-0.663). Overall survival at 2 and 5 years was 58% and 37%, respectively. Patients with MCC treated with RTx have a high likelihood of obtaining in-field control. Doses of 50 to 55 Gy in 20 to 25 fractions are recommended. A minority of patients are cured, with many dying of systemic relapse. Lower dose fractionation schedules (e.g., 25 Gy in 5 fractions) may be considered in patients with a very poor performance status.

Differential biomechanical development of elastic tissues in the bovine fetus. Mechanical loading conditions are important factors in the gestational development of fetal tissues. However, little is known about how mechanical loading during development modulates the structure and function of elastic tissues. We hypothesized that developing elastic tissues functionally adapt to their loading conditions. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the changes in the composition, viscoelasticity, and thermoelastic properties of elastic tissue from bovine aortas (functional during gestation) and nuchal ligaments (nonfunctional during gestation). Clear differences in the developmental timeline of elastic tissue structure and function were observed between aortic and ligament elastic tissue. Elastic tissue in the aorta developed earlier than that of the nuchal ligament, indicating a role for loading conditions in the timeline of development. Ligament elastic tissue, however, underwent rapid remodeling in late gestation-likely as a preadaptation to the sudden-onset of tensile load it experiences at birth. Finally, while the same fundamental structure-mechanical relationships were seen in both tissues, there was a clear difference in mechanical properties between the elastic tissues from the adult nuchal ligament and the adult aorta, indicating that postnatal loading conditions continue to influence tissue structure and mechanical properties, tailoring them to their functional roles in adult life.


Tandem affinity purification of miRNA target mRNAs (TAP-Tar).

Mycobacterium tuberculosis spoligotypes in Monterrey, Mexico. Although tuberculosis is still a public health problem in Mexico, there is little information about the genetic characteristics of the isolates. In the present study, we analyzed by spoligotyping 180 Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates from the urban area of Monterrey, Mexico, including drug-susceptible and drug-resistant isolates. The spoligotype patterns were compared with those in the international SITVIT2 spoligotyping database. Four isolates presented spoligotype patterns not found in the database (orphan types); the rest were distributed among 44 spoligo international types (SITs). SIT53 (clade T1) and SIT119 (clade X1) were predominant and included 43 (23.8%) and 28 (15.5%) of the isolates, respectively. In order to determine if there was a dominant spoligotype in the group of multidrug-resistant isolates, 37 of them were analyzed by IS6110-based restriction fragment length polymorphism assays, and scarce clustering of strains with more than five bands was observed. Fourteen isolates of this multidrug-resistant group presented four bands or less and were distributed in four SITs: SIT53 (n = 8), SIT92 (n = 3), SIT70 (n = 2), and SIT3038 (n = 1). When the molecular detection of mutations in the katG and rpoB genes were analyzed in these isolates with low copy numbers of IS6110, only two isolates shared the same IS6110, spoligotyping, and mutations patterns. When the distribution of the spoligotypes was analyzed by age cohort, SIT119 was predominantly found in patients 0 to 20 years old, especially in males, accounting for up to 40% of the isolates. In contrast, SIT53 was more prevalent in older females. This analysis demonstrates the variability of M. tuberculosis isolates in Monterrey and the partial dominance of SIT53 and SIT119 in that area of Mexico.

Reconstruction of the defects in the middle of the nose with subcutaneous pedicled nasolabial island flap: report of two cases. Two cases with basal cell carcinomas on the middle of the nose were treated by using subcutaneous pedicled nasolabial island flap. There were no partial or total flap losses in either case and neither of the cases had local recurrence during the follow-up period. The subcutaneous pedicled nasolabial flap should be considered to be an alternative to the paramedian forehead flap for the reconstruction of defects on the middle of the nose. In this article two cases in whom subcutaneous pedicled nasolabial island flap method was applied for the reconstruction of middle defects of the nose are presented in the light of the literature.

[Association of male infertility with (CAG)n polymorphism of the androgen receptor gene: a meta-analysis]. To assess the association of male infertility with CAG repeat polymorphism of the androgen receptor (AR) gene by meta-analysis. We identified the case-control studies on the relationship of male infertility with CAG repeats of the AR gene by searching Medline/PubMed and CBM databases, and conducted meta-analysis on the data obtained with the RevMan 4.2 software. Thirty-two eligible articles were selected in this study, including 3,153 idiopathic infertile men and 2,314 controls. The combined data statistics showed that all the infertile men had a significantly higher mean of CAG repeats than the controls (SMD = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.17-0.37, P < 0.01). The specific SMD between the infertile patients and controls was 0.29, 95% CI: 0.08-0.50 for the azoospermic men, 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13-0.41 for the moderate oligozoospermic men, and 0.18, 95% CI: 0.02-0.33 for the severe oligozoospermic cases. The results of sensitivity analyses were consistent with those mentioned above. The increased length of CAG repeats in the AR gene may be correlated with the risk of the impairment of spermatogenesis.

Consumer Shell Egg Consumption and Handling Practices: Results from a National Survey. Numerous cases and outbreaks of Salmonella infection are attributable to shell eggs each year in the United States. Safe handling and consumption of shell eggs at home can help reduce foodborne illness attributable to shell eggs. A nationally representative Web survey of 1,504 U.S. adult grocery shoppers was conducted to describe consumer handling practices and consumption of shell eggs at home. Based on self-reported survey data, most respondents purchase shell eggs from a grocery store (89.5%), and these eggs were kept refrigerated (not at room temperature; 98.5%). As recommended, most consumers stored shell eggs in the refrigerator (99%) for no more than 3 to 5 weeks (97.6%). After cracking eggs, 48.1% of respondents washed their hands with soap and water. More than half of respondents who fry and/or poach eggs cooked them so that the whites and/or the yolks were still soft or runny, a potentially unsafe practice. Among respondents who owned a food thermometer (62.0%), only 5.2% used it to check the doneness of baked egg dishes when they prepared such a dish. Consumers generally followed two of the four core "Safe Food Families" food safety messages ("separate" and "chill") when handling shell eggs at home. To prevent Salmonella infection associated with shell eggs, consumers should improve their practices related to the messages "clean" (i.e., wash hands after cracking eggs) and "cook" (i.e., cook until yolks and whites are firm and use a food thermometer to check doneness of baked egg dishes) when preparing shell eggs at home. These findings will be used to inform the development of science-based consumer education materials that can help reduce foodborne illness from Salmonella infection.

Phage library-screening: a powerful approach for generation of targeting-agents specific for normal pancreatic islet-cells and islet-cell carcinoma in vivo. Phage display technology is a powerful approach for the generation of peptides and antibodies that target specific organ- or tumor-structures. By applying this approach to rats in vivo or freshly isolated rat islets in vitro, we have recently reported the successful isolation of internalizing single-chain antibodies (SCA-antibodies), which are highly specific for the endocrine-cells of a pancreatic islet (either beta- or alpha-cells) both in rodents and in humans. Moreover, others have reported peptides targeting specifically the vascular endothelium of normal or pre-malignant islets or advanced islet-cell tumors. The features of these antibodies and peptides are compatible with a potential use for in vivo delivery of molecular cargos (e.g. imaging agents and therapeutics). Therefore, this article reviews the principles of phage display, provides an overview about agents either specific for the endocrine-cells or the vascular endothelium of islets, discusses methododical key elements for the generation of these ligands and highlights remaining questions and potential future perspectives.

Inflammation: a bridge between postoperative cognitive dysfunction and Alzheimer's disease. Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) which is a decline in cognitive function after surgery can present days to weeks after surgery and may remain a permanent disorder. The exact pathophysiological mechanism of POCD is still unknown. In view the incidence of POCD does not seem to be influenced by the depth and the type of anesthesia, many investigators believe that inflammatory response plays a key role in the pathogenesis of POCD. Animals and human studies show POCD associates with peripheral inflammatory and neuroinflammatory response. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a insidious and progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the elderly. In clinical practice AD trials have not provided a satisfactory approach for the prevention and therapy. It is because we still do not know its exact etiological factor and pathogenesis. Similarly, neuroinflammatory response is involved in the pathophysiological process of AD. The activation of microglia may be the common pathogenesis of POCD and AD. We hypothesize that inflammatory response is the initial factor of the occurrence and development of POCD and AD. Neuroinflammatory response associates with POCD and AD. The effective pathway to prevention and therapy of POCD and AD should consider measures against inflammatory response, especially against neuroinflammatory response.

Some historical notes on the diagnosis of death--the emergence of the brain death concept. This paper demonstrates that discussions about the diagnosis of death and the meaning of states of suspended animation existed long before the publication of the Harvard criteria in 1968. The surgeons who started retrieving kidneys from heart beating cadavers have been accused to redefine death in order to obtain high quality organs. In fact, they were not aware of modifying a definition. They did not view death as a philosophical concept but considered that it was a biological phenomenon of which brain death was merely a new expression resulting from the development of resuscitation and intensive care procedures.

Heat shock protein 27 is over-expressed in tumor tissues and increased in sera of patients with gastric adenocarcinoma. In a previous study, we found that heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) was over-expressed in gastric adenocarcinoma (GA) tissue. In this study, our goal was to further verify the expression profile of HSP27 in patients with GA. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were employed to determine HSP27 expression in 50 paired tumor and adjacent normal tissue. ELISA was used to quantify serum HSP27 concentrations in the same 50 GA patients and 50 healthy individuals. Compared to adjacent normal tissues, HSP27 was over-expressed in 25 (50%, p=0.000) and 24 (48%, p=0.000) cases of GA tissue by Western blot and immunohistochemistry, respectively. ELISA revealed significantly higher serum concentrations of HSP27 in patients with GA patients (mean=986 pg/mL) compared to healthy individuals (mean=573 pg/mL) (p=0.003). In addition, infection with Helicobacter pylori (HP) in healthy individuals was associated with increased expression of HSP27 in both gastric mucosa and serum. These data suggest that HSP27 is over-expressed in GA tissue and serum concentrations of HSP27 are increased in patients with GA. Over-expression of HSP27 may indicate a gastric malignant/infectious process. The detection of serum HSP27 concentrations by ELISA may be useful for screening for GA.

Characterization of Abnormal Optic Nerve Head Morphology in Albinism Using Optical Coherence Tomography. To characterize abnormalities in three-dimensional optic nerve head (ONH) morphology in people with albinism (PWA) using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and to determine whether ONH abnormalities relate to other retinal and clinical abnormalities. Spectral-domain OCT was used to obtain three-dimensional images from 56 PWA and 60 age- and sex-matched control subjects. B-scans were corrected for nystagmus-associated motion artefacts. Disc, cup, and rim ONH dimensions and peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (ppRNFL) thickness were calculated using Copernicus and ImageJ software. Median disc areas were similar in PWA (median = 1.65 mm2) and controls (1.71 mm2, P = 0.128), although discs were significantly elongated horizontally in PWA (P < 0.001). In contrast, median optic cup area in PWA (0.088 mm2) was 23.7% of that in controls (0.373 mm2, P < 0.001), with 39.4% of eyes in PWA not demonstrating a measurable optic cup. This led to significantly smaller cup to disc ratios in PWA (P < 0.001). Median rim volume in PWA (0.273 mm3) was 136.6% of that in controls (0.200 mm3). The ppRNFL was significantly thinner in PWA compared with controls (P < 0.001), especially in the temporal quadrant. In PWA, ppRNFL thickness was correlated to ganglion cell thickness at the central fovea (P = 0.007). Several ONH abnormalities, such as cup to disc ratio, were related to higher refractive errors in PWA. In PWA, ocular maldevelopment is not just limited to the retina but also involves the ONH. Reduced ppRNFL thickness is consistent with previous reports of reduced ganglion cell numbers in PWA. The thicker rim volumes may be a result of incomplete maturation of the ONH.


A comprehensive cardiopulmonary simulation model for the analysis of hypercapnic respiratory failure.

Oxidative stress studies in yeast with a frataxin mutant: a proteomics perspective. Cellular response of wild-type Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the Delta yfh1 mutant to oxidative stress (OS) was examined by stressing cells through the addition of H(2)O(2) to the growth medium. The Delta yfh1 mutant is unusual in that it accumulates iron in it is mitochondria. Wild-type growth was immediately arrested and recovered in 2 h following H(2)O(2) treatment. No change in viability was observed. Growth of the mutant, on the other hand, was similar to wild-type yeast for 4 h but then rapidly declined, eventually reaching zero. Levels of carbonyl groups and reactive oxygen species (ROS) reached their maximum at 3 h following exposure. The impact of OS on protein function was also evaluated by proteomic techniques targeting protein carbonylation. Oxidized proteins were selected by affinity chromatography, and following trypsin digestion, peptide fragments were identified by RPLC-MS/MS. A total of 53 proteins were identified in both wild-type and mutant cells, respectively.

Do infants show generalized imitation of gestures? II. The effects of skills training and multiple exemplar matching training. The determinants of generalized imitation of manual gestures were investigated in 1- to 2-year-old infants. Eleven infants were first trained eight baseline matching relations; then, four novel gestures that the infants did not match in probe trials were selected as target behaviors. Next, in a generalized imitation test in which matching responses to baseline models were intermittently reinforced, but matching responses to target models were not eligible for reinforcement, the infants matched baseline models but not the majority of their target behaviors. To ensure their failure to match the target behaviors was not due to motor constraints, the infants were trained, in a multiple-baseline procedure, to produce the target responses under stimulus control that did not include an antecedent model of the target behavior. There was no evidence of generalized imitation in subsequent tests. When the infants were next trained to match each target behavior to criterion (tested in extinction) in a multiple-baseline-across-behaviors procedure, only 2 infants continued to match all their targets in subsequent tests; the remaining infants matched only some of them. Seven infants were next given mixed matching training with the target behaviors to criterion (tested in extinction); they subsequently matched these targets without reinforcement when interspersed with trials on which matching responses to baseline models were intermittently reinforced. In repeat tests, administered at 3-week intervals, these 7 children (and 2 that did not take part in mixed matching training) continued to match most of their target behaviors. The results support a trained matching account, but provide no evidence of generalized imitation, in 1- to 2-year-old infants.

In vitro and in vivo pharmacological characterization of two novel selective cannabinoid CB(2) receptor inverse agonists. We have previously developed quinolone-3-carboxamides with the aim of obtaining new ligands for both cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2. Our preliminary screening led to the identification of cannabinoid receptor ligands characterized by high affinity and, in some cases, also selectivity for CB(2) receptors. Specifically, three compounds, 1, 2 and 3 showed high affinity for CB2 as well as high selectivity over CB1 receptors. In addition, the activity shown by 1 against the formalin-induced nocifensive response in mice, reported in our previous paper, suggests that quinolone-3-carboxamides possess anti-nociceptive properties. In the present work, we have performed functional in vitro bioassays with the aim of investigating the functional activity in the [35S]GTPgammaS binding assay of the other two compounds that, like 1, behave as CB2 selective ligands, and their potential analgesic actions in vivo. We found that both 2 and 3 behave in vitro as CB2 inverse agonists and are able to decrease nociceptive behaviour in the late phase of the formalin test only at the highest dose tested, although, at lower doses, they prevent the anti-nociceptive effects of a selective CB2 partial agonist in the formalin test. These results identify in 2 and 3 two novel, potent and selective CB2 antagonists/inverse agonists and confirm previous reports in the literature that, in addition to agonists at cannabinoid CB2 receptors, also inverse agonists/antagonists at these receptors show promise as anti-inflammatory agents.

[EUREGIO MRSA-net Twente/MÃ¼nsterland: "search & follow" by Euregional network building]. Staphylococcus aureus causes the majority of healthcare-associated infections worldwide. Particularly critical are infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), for which there are few possibilities of antibiotic therapy. It is known that the occurrence of MRSA is directly associated with increased morbidity and mortality. There is also evidence for an increased lethality in hospital-acquired MRSA infections and MRSA bacteraemia in comparison to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus. Besides prolonged and severe disease conditions, the occurrence of MRSA results is extremely laborious and has for the hospitals very expensive consequences, in extreme cases the closure of an entire ward. Nosocomial infections due to MRSA lead to a significantly prolonged length of stay of the patient and leads therefore to extra costs due to recommended hygiene measures (e. g. isolation in a single room). The long-term treatment options can have side effects and are often limited to expensive antibiotics. The growing number of patients treated with severe underlying diseases and the increasing number of expensive medical treatments leads to a further exacerbation of this situation. In times of limited financial resources, this might lead to irresolvable conflicts between the patient safety required and the health funding available.

Whole Exome Sequencing Identified MCM2 as a Novel Causative Gene for Autosomal Dominant Nonsyndromic Deafness in a Chinese Family. We report the genetic analysis of autosomal dominant, nonsyndromic, progressive sensorineural hearing loss in a Chinese family. Using whole exome sequencing, we identified a missense variant (c.130C>T, p.R44C) in the MCM2 gene, which has a pro-apoptosis effect and is involved in the initiation of eukaryotic genome replication. This missense variant is very likely to be the disease causing variant. It segregated with hearing loss in this pedigree, and was not found in the dbSNP database or databases of genomes and SNP in the Chinese population, in 76 patients with sporadic hearing loss, or in 145 normal individuals. We performed western blot and immunofluorescence to test the MCM2 protein expression in the cochlea of rats and guinea pigs, demonstrating that MCM2 was widely expressed in the cochlea and was also surprisingly expressed in the cytoplasm of terminally differentiated hair cells. We then transiently expressed the variant MCM2 cDNA in HEK293 cells, and found that these cells displayed a slight increase in apoptosis without any changes in proliferation or cell cycle, supporting the view that this variant is pathogenic. In summary, we have identified MCM2 as a novel gene responsible for nonsyndromic hearing loss of autosomal dominant inheritance in a Chinese family.

Transfer of gene to human retinal pigment epithelial cells using magnetite cationic liposomes. To present a new method called magnetolipofection which can transfect cells in a specific area of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) by magnetic force as a non-viral gene transfection. ARPE-19 (a human RPE cell line) cells were cultured with a mixture of cationic lipid, plasmid DNAs and magnetite nanoparticles. A sheet of ARPE-19 cells was transfected in the vertical direction by placing a magnet under the centre of the culture plate. Horizontal gene transfection was also performed. When magnetolipofection was performed in the vertical direction, there was a significantly larger number of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive cells where the magnet was placed than in the peripheral area, and the number was equivalent to the number transfected with Lipofectamine2000. In the horizontal direction, there was also a significantly larger number of GFP-positive cells, but there was almost no gene transfer detected using Lipofectamine2000. The area of gene transfection can be controlled by the placement of a magnet in the area selected to be transfected in vitro by magnetolipofection. This method can be used to transfect RPE cells in selected areas which should be helpful for experimental and clinical applications.

[Simulation study of anti-hypoxia active fraction of Xiangdan injection by support vector machine]. To investigate the anti-hypoxia active fraction of Xiangdan injection. The anti-hypoxia experiment under normal pressure with mice was adopted on the basis of orthogonal design, and a support vector machine model was established for pharmacodynamics prediction of TCM prescriptions. Moreover, the anti-hypoxia active fraction of Xiangdan injection was determined by experimental confirmation. The prediction model established in this study could predict the drug actions of different formulas. As indicated in model prediction and experimental confirmation, the pharmacodynamic actions of several formulas are superior to that of the original formula, and ADE has the best effect.

Screening for depression in adults: U.S. preventive services task force recommendation statement.

AGEs increased migration and inflammatory responses of adventitial fibroblasts via RAGE, MAPK and NF-kappaB pathways. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and vascular adventitial fibroblasts (AFs) are involved in diabetes-related vascular complications. However, the effect of AGEs on AFs remains unclear. The aim of this study was to observe the impact of AGEs on cell migration capacity and associated inflammatory responses of AFs. Isolated vascular AFs of Sprague-Dawley rats were cultured, harvested after 24h synchronization and challenged with AGE-HSA. AGE-HSA upregulated the expression of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), significantly increased the migration capacity and inflammatory mediators MCP-1, IL-6, VCAM-1 expressions on AFs. These effects could be significantly attenuated by anti-RAGE neutralizing antibody, p38, ERK1/2 and JNK MAPK inhibitors as well as by candesartan. AGE-HAS also upregulated NF-kappaB transcriptional activity and I-kappaB-alpha phosphorylation, effect that was significantly inhibited by candesartan. AGE-HSA increased the migration capacity and inflammatory responses of rat AFs via RAGE-MAPK-NF-kappaB pathways. Candesartan effectively inhibited these effects which might be a novel vascular protection mechanism of candesartan.

Myocarditis in children and detection of viruses in myocardial tissue: implications for immunosuppressive therapy. There is scarce information on the potential benefits of immunosuppression in children with myocarditis and viral genomes in myocardium. We investigated the occurrence of myocarditis in children with a preliminary diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, the frequency of cardiotropic viruses in the myocardium, and the response to immunosuppression. Thirty patients (nine months to 12 years) with left ventricular ejection fraction of 22.8 Â± 4.1% were subjected to right cardiac catheterization and endomyocardial biopsy. Specimens were analyzed for the presence of inflammatory elements (Dallas criteria) and viral genome (polymerase chain reaction). Patients with active myocarditis received immunosuppressants (azatioprine and prednisone) and were re-catheterized nine months later. A historical control group of nine patients with myocarditis who did not receive immunosuppressants was included. Active myocarditis was diagnosed in ten patients (five with viral genomes detected). Immunosuppression resulted in a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction from 25.2 Â± 2.8% to 45.7 Â± 8.6% (versus 20.0 Â± 4.0% to 22.0 Â± 9.0% in historical controls, p<0.01) and cardiac index from 3.28 Â± 0.51 L/min/m(2) to 4.40 Â± 0.49 L/min/m(2) (versus 3.50 Â± 0.40 L/min/m(2) to 3.70 Â± 0.50 L/min/m(2) in controls, p<0.01), regardless of the presence of viral genomes (p=0.98 and p=0.22, respectively for the two variables). No relevant clinical events were observed. Non-inflammatory cardiomyopathy was diagnosed in 20 patients (seven with viral genomes). While on conventional therapy, there were four deaths and three assignments to transplantation, and no improvement of left ventricular ejection fraction in the remaining ones (22.5 Â± 3.6% to 27.5 Â± 10.6%). Children with chronic myocarditis seem to benefit from immunosuppressive therapy, regardless of the presence of viral genome in the myocardium.

Short hairpin RNA-mediated inhibition of S100A4 promotes apoptosis and suppresses proliferation of BGC823 gastric cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. S100A4 has been found to be over-expressed in gastric cancer and associated with poor prognosis of the patients, yet the exact role and molecular mechanism of S100A4 in gastric cancer has not been determined. We found that S100A4 inhibition by RNAi lead to reduced proliferation and increased apoptosis of gastric cancer cell line BGC823. Intratumoral injection of pS100A4-shRNA suppressed tumor growth in nude mice. We also found that S100A4 inhibition decreased the expression of both NF-kappaB p65 and phospho(Ser32)-I-kappaB-alpha. Our results suggested that S100A4 may be an attractive candidate for the therapeutic targeting of gastric cancer.

Using architecture and technology to promote improved quality of life for military service members with traumatic brain injury. Today, injured service members are surviving wounds that would have been fatal in previous wars. A recent RAND report estimates that approximately 320,000 service members may have experienced a traumatic brain injury (TBI) during deployment, and it is not uncommon for a soldier to sustain multiple associated injuries such as limb loss, paralysis, sensory loss, and psychological damage. As a result, many military service members and their families face significant challenges returning to a high quality of independent life. The architectural concepts of universal design (UD) and evidence-based design (EBD) are gaining interest as an integral part of the rehabilitation process of veterans with TBI. This article examines the possibilities presented by UD and EBD in accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, in terms of high-end building and interior design quality, and possible technological options for individuals with disabilities.

Predictive factors for negative outcomes in initial non-operative management of suspected appendicitis. Acute appendicitis has been reported to be managed with non-operative therapy at relatively high successful rate. However, risk factors for negative outcome have not been established. Three hundred eighty consecutive patients who underwent initial therapy for suspected appendicitis were reviewed. They were divided into three groups: operation group, the group successfully managed with non-operative therapy (success group), and the group required surgical conversion (failure group). Preoperative clinical data were compared among the groups and risk factors for negative outcomes were investigated. Thirteen patients were excluded due to contraindication for non-operative therapy. Of the remaining 367 patients, 143 patients (39.0%) were primarily treated with surgery, and 224 patients (61.0%) were initially managed with antibiotics. Among the 224 patients, 91 patients (40.6%) were refractory to antibiotics and converted to surgery after more than 24 h usage of antibiotics. Multivariate analysis revealed that elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) level (>4 mg/dL) and presence of appendicolith were significant risk factors for conversion. Morbidity rate showed no significant difference between the operative and failure groups. Elevated CRP concentration and appendicolith may predict the negative outcome in non-operative management. However, immediate appendectomy can possibly be avoided at least 24 h without increasing morbidity under the usage of antibiotics.

Reduction of the onset response in high frequency nerve block with amplitude ramps from non-zero amplitudes.

The relationship between slowing EEGs and the progression of Parkinson's disease. The previous association study confirmed that diffuse slowing of EEGs was present in Parkinson's disease (PD), demonstrated with the use of the quantitative EEG technique. This study was the first to assess the relationship between progression of PD and quantitative EEG. A total of 106 patients with PD with a mean Hoehn-Yahr stage of 2.73 were serially enrolled. Lack of ischemic lesions was confirmed in all patients by magnetic resonance imaging. Absolute power values were measured for four frequency bands from delta to beta. The electrodes were divided among six locations: frontal pole, frontal, central, parietal, temporal, and occipital locations. Spectral ratio was calculated as the sum of power values for the alpha and beta waves divided by the sum values for the slow waves. The relationship between the progression of PD and spectral ratio was assessed by the Jonckheere-Terpstra trend test. At all electrode locations, spectral ratio significantly decreased with progression of Hoehn-Yahr stage (frontal pole, P = 0.007; frontal, P = 0.005; central, P = 0.031; parietal, P = 0.017; temporal, P = 0.005; occipital, P = 0.010). This shows that the slowing of EEGs became more obvious with PD progression.

Prevalence of temporomandibular disorders in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease: a case-controlled study. The present study estimated the prevalence of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). A study group consisting of 60 adult patients (34 women and 26 men) diagnosed with GERD was matched by age and gender to a control group of 60 patients without any signs or symptoms of GERD. The diagnosis of TMD was established using the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders. Of the 60 patients in the study group, 22 (36.6%) had TMD compared with 11 (18.3%) in the control group (P = .025). Most patients with TMD in both groups were diagnosed with myofascial pain: 19 (31.7%) in the study group versus 9 (15%) in the control group (P = .031). The increased TMD prevalence in patients with GERD should be explored further to better characterize the association between TMD and GERD. The physicians treating the 2 disorders should consider the clinical implications of this association.

Diagnostic value of exhaled nitric oxide to detect interstitial lung disease in systemic sclerosis. Increased alveolar concentration of nitric oxide (CA(NO)) is related to the severity of interstitial lung disease (ILD) in systemic sclerosis (SSc). However, cut-off levels of CA(NO) to rule out, or to rule in, the presence of ILD in individual patients are unknown. We aimed to assess the validity of CA(NO) for the diagnosis of ILD in SSc and to determine the thresholds of CA(NO) that can be used in clinical practice to predict the likelihood of ILD in SSc. Lung HRCT scan, PFTs and partitioned exhaled NO measurements were performed in 65 consecutive SSc patients. ILD was diagnosed on pulmonary HRCT according to the presence of ground glass or reticular opacities. Diagnostic performance of CANo for ILD diagnosis was assessed using ROC curves. 38 out of 65 SSc patients had ILD. CA(NO), at a cut-off level of 4.3 ppb, had a sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of ILD of 87% (95% CI: 77 to 99) and 59% (95% CI: 41 to 78), respectively. The same cut-off level of CA(NO) could detect impairment of gas exchange with a sensitivity and specificity of 78% (95% CI: 67 to 90) and 73% (95% CI: 46 to 99), respectively. Moreover, ILD could be ruled in (positive predictive value > 95%) when CA(NO) > or = 10.8 ppb, and ruled out C(ANO) values < or = 3.8 ppb (negative predictive value > 95%). CA(NO) could be a valid non-invasive biological marker of ILD in SSc, and be of use in clinical practice.

[Hair micrograft technique for eyebrow reconstruction]. The eyebrow reconstruction should restore an eyebrow with a natural shape and with matching hair direction. We describe the micrograft hair technique for eyebrow reconstruction, using either hair from the opposite eyebrow or hair from the scalp. We illustrate our technique with three clinical cases: a traumatic eyebrow injury, a burn scar and a progressive hair loss. We insist on the advantages of this technique which is simple, "taylor-made" and which allows to choose the hair direction according to the eyebrow topography. The micrograft hair technique has many advantages in comparison with scalp strip grafting or hair-bearing island scalp flap techniques. The eyebrow reconstruction using micrograft hair technique is a simple effective technique offering a better cosmetic result than usual techniques by achieving a natural hair direction and density.

[Clinical evaluation on the cornea flap with different thickness after LASIK]. To investigate morphologically the different changes of cornea tissue between thick and thin cornea flap with confocal microscope, and to compare visual function between thick and thin cornea flap after LASIK. 70 cases (70 eyes) who had received LASIK were divided into the thin cornea flap group (36 eyes, group A) and the thick cornea flap group (34 eyes, group B). The age was (23 +/- 5) years old, spherical equivalent diopter (SE) were ( - 4.76 +/- 2.30) D and (- 3.03 +/- 2.20) D. Inspection items included visual acuity (VA), refraction, wave-front analysis, contrast sensitivity analysis (KONTRASTOMETER BA4, Germany) during pre-and post-LASIK, at the same time, all eyes were examined by confocal microcopy (HRT III, Germany). Using Moria 90 microm and 130 microm keratome with Allegretto Excimer laser machine. Refraction: there was no difference between the two groups. Post-LASIK 3 to 6 months: group A (0.35 +/- 0.21) D; group B (0.45 +/- 0.69) D (P > 0.05). Comparison results by confocal microscope. The thickness of cornea flap: group A (107.37 +/- 20.5) microm, group B (149 +/- 25.2) microm (P < 0.05). The thickness of wrinkle: group A (63.71 +/- 15.8) microm; group B (48.16 +/- 20.7) microm (P < 0.05). The thickness of acellular area: group A (69.93 +/- 15.8) microm; group B (55.63 +/- 23.7) microm (P < 0.05). The thickness of activation cornea cells: group A (60.15 +/- 30.9) microm; group B (51.86 +/- 27.9) microm (P < 0.05). The density of anterior stromal: group A (825.14 +/- 156.9) mm2; group B (853.54 +/- 126.8) mm2 (P < 0.05). There were significant differences on the thickness of cornea flap, the thickness of wrinkle, the thickness of acellular area, the thickness of activation cornea cells, the density of anterior stromal, but there was no difference on posterior stromal (P > 0.05). Wavefront analysis:there was no difference between two groups in Z3(-3), Z3(-1), Z3(1), Z3(3), Z4(0), RMS3, RMS4, RMS5, RMS6, RMSh (P > 0.05) pre-and post-operation. Contrast sensitivity analysis: there was also no difference between two groups (P > 0.05) pre-and post-LASIK 1-6 month. From the point of confocal microscope view, morphologic changes of cornea was significant with different thick flap. It is not cicatricial healing between the cornea flap and stromal. The cell injury of cornea tissue in the thin cornea flap was severe than that of in the thick cornea flap even though there was no significant difference between thin and thick cornea flap group in clinical refraction correction, wavefront and contrast sensitivity.


Nocardia pseudobrasiliensis as an emerging cause of opportunistic infection after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Synthesis and study of the antifungal activity of new mono- and disubstituted derivatives of a genetically engineered polyene antibiotic 28,29-didehydronystatin A1 (S44HP). Mono- and disubstituted novel derivatives of the heptaene nystatin analog 28,29-didehydronystatin A(1) (S44HP, 1) were obtained by chemical modification of the exocyclic C-16 carboxyl and/or an amino group of mycosamine moiety. The strategy of preparation of mono- and double-modified polyene macrolides was based on the use of intermediate hydrophobic N-Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) derivatives that facilitated the procedures of isolation and purification of new compounds. The antifungal activity of the new derivatives was first tested in vitro against yeasts and filamentous fungi, allowing the selection of the most active compounds that were subsequently tested for acute toxicity in mice. 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethylamide of 1 (2) and 2-(N,N-dimethylamino)ethylamide of N-fructopyranosyl-28,29-didehydronystatin A(1) (2a) were then selected for further evaluation in a mouse model of disseminated candidosis, and showed high efficacy while being considerably less toxic than amphotericin B (AmB). The compound with improved water solubility (2G, L-glutamic acid salt of 2) showed better chemotherapeutic activity than AmB in the mouse model of candidosis sepsis on a leucopenic background. Very low antifungal effect was seen after treatment with AmB, even if it was used in maximum tolerated dose (2 mg kg(-1)). Unlike AmB, compound 2G exhibited high activity in doses from 0.4 up to 4.0 mg kg(-1), despite leucopenic conditions.

Traumatic cervical discoligamentous injuries: correlation of magnetic resonance imaging and operative findings. Retrospective review using prospectively collected data. The purpose of the study was to investigate the diagnostic properties of cervical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in detecting surgically verified disruptions of the anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL), intervertebral disc, and posterior longitudinal ligament (PLL). Cervical MRI findings commonly provide the basis for the decision to stabilize cervical injury operatively. The correlation of cervical MRI findings with direct visualization of the cervical discoligamentous structures during operative management is a subject of debate. The cervical spine MRI scans of patients who subsequently underwent anterior surgical stabilization after traumatic discoligamentous injury of the cervical spine were reviewed. The level and severity of ALL, disc and PLL disruption was compared with surgical findings. The sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of MRI in the detection of surgically verified injuries were calculated. The MRI and surgical findings were compared on 31 consecutive patients, with the kappa values for ALL, intervertebral disc, and PLL disruption measuring 0.22, 0.25, and 0.31, respectively. MRI scans provided reasonable sensitivity to disc disruption (0.81) but poor sensitivity to ALL (0.48) and PLL (0.50) injury. Specificity for ALL and PLL disruption was 1.00 and 0.87, respectively, but 0.00 for disc disruption. The positive predictive value of MRI for ALL and intervertebral disc injury was 1.00 and 0.96, respectively, but 0.63 for PLL disruption. The false-negative rates for disruption of the ALL, disc and PLL were 0.52, 0.19, and 0.50, respectively. The ability of cervical MRI to detect surgically verified disruptions of the ALL, intervertebral disc, and PLL varied depending on the structure examined. MRI was sensitive but not specific for disc injury, and specific but not sensitive to ALL and PLL disruption. In this series, the comparison of cervical MRI and operative findings indicated that MRI was reliable only when positive for ALL and disc injury, and a reasonably reliable indicator of PLL status only when negative for PLL injury. Additionally, the high false-negative rates for ALL and PLL injury are concerning.

Liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease in Europe: a study from the ELTR (European Liver Transplant Registry). Alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) is one of the most common indications for liver transplantation (LT). Long-term outcome after LT for ALD versus other etiologies is still under debate. The aim of this study was to compare outcome after LT of patients with ALD, viral (VIR), and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Donor, graft and recipient ELTR variables were analysed in transplants for alcoholic and nonalcoholic cirrhosis (1988-2005) and were correlated with patient survival. Causes of death and/or graft failure were compared between groups. Nine thousand eight hundred eighty ALD, 10,943 VIR, 1478 ALD+VIR and 2410 cryptogenic (CRYP) liver transplants were evaluated. One, 3, 5 and 10 years graft survival rates after LT in ALD patients were 84%, 78%, 73%, 58%, significantly higher than in VIR and CRYP (p=0.04, p=0.05). By multivariate analysis, ALD+VIR (RR 1.14) and viral alone (RR 1.06) were significant risk factors for mortality. De novo tumors, cardiovascular and social causes were causes of death/graft failure in higher percentage in ALD groups versus other etiologies. LT for ALD cirrhosis has a favorable outcome, however, hepatitis C virus co-infection seems to eliminate this advantage. Screening for de novo tumors and prevention of cardiovascular complications are essential to provide better long-term results.

Association of Porphyromonas gingivalis with high levels of stress-induced hormone cortisol in chronic periodontitis patients.

Equine herpesvirus type 1 mutant defective in glycoprotein E gene as candidate vaccine strain. An equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV-1) mutant, DeltagE, defective in glycoprotein E (gE) was evaluated as a modified live virus (MLV) vaccine. Colostrum-deprived Thoroughbred foals inoculated intranasally (i.n.) or intramuscularly (i.m.) with DeltagE did not exhibit any clinical signs of respiratory disease except for a mild nasal discharge in 1 i.n. inoculated foal on Days 1 and 3 post-infection. In contrast, the intranasal inoculation of foals with the revertant of DeltagE resulted in biphasic pyrexia, mucopurulent nasal discharge and swelling of submandibular lymph nodes. These results indicated that gE plays an important role as regards EHV-1 virulence in horses. The ability of DeltagE to protect against wild type EHV-1 challenge infection was assessed using i.m. vaccinated foals. Foals inoculated twice i.m. with 10(5) or 10(6) plaque-forming units (pfu) of DeltagE at an interval of 3 weeks exhibited no clinical evidence of local inflammation, respiratory disease or deleterious systemic responses. Remarkable increases in SN antibody titer to EHV-1 were observed in all vaccinated foals after the 2nd inoculation with DeltagE. Following a wild type EHV-1 challenge infection, vaccinated foals showed milder clinical symptoms than foals vaccinated with a placebo. Specifically, 1 of 3 foals vaccinated with 10(6) pfu of DeltagE exhibited no clinical symptoms other than a mild nasal discharge for 1 day. Additionally, the virus load of nasal shedding and viremia were reduced by vaccination. These results suggest that DeltagE would be a good candidate as an MLV vaccine.

Salvage Surgery After Chemoradiotherapy in the Management of Esophageal Cancer: Is It a Viable Therapeutic Option? The aim of this large multicenter study was to assess the impact of salvage esophagectomy after definitive chemoradiotherapy (SALV) on clinical outcome. Data from consecutive adult patients undergoing resection for esophageal cancer in 30 European centers from 2000 to 2010 were collected. First, groups undergoing SALV (n = 308) and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by planned esophagectomy (NCRS; n = 540) were compared. Second, patients who benefited from SALV for persistent (n = 234) versus recurrent disease (n = 74) were compared. Propensity score matching and multivariable analyses were used to compensate for differences in some baseline characteristics. SALV versus NCRS groups: In-hospital mortality was similar in both groups (8.4% v 9.3%). The only significant differences in complications were seen for anastomotic leak (17.2% v 10.7%; P = .007) and surgical site infection, which were both more frequent in the SALV group. At 3 years, groups had similar overall (43.3% v 40.1%; P = .542) and disease-free survival (39.2% v 32.8%; P = .232) after matching, along with a similar recurrence pattern. Persistent versus recurrent disease groups: There were no significant differences between groups in incidence of in-hospital mortality or major complications. At 3 years, overall (40.9% v 56.2%; P = .046) and disease-free survival (36.6% v 51.6%; P = .095) were lower in the persistent disease group. The results of this large multicenter study from the modern era suggest that SALV can offer acceptable short- and long-term outcomes in selected patients at experienced centers. Persistent cancer after definitive chemoradiotherapy seems to be more biologically aggressive, with poorer survival compared with recurrent cancer.

Mimotope vaccination for therapy of allergic asthma: anti-inflammatory effects in a mouse model. One of the concerns of allergen-specific immunotherapy is the possible boost of inflammatory allergen-specific T lymphocytes. To address this problem, treatment with B cell epitopes devoid of allergen-specific T cell epitopes would be a promising alternative. In this study, we examined the therapeutic potency of a single mimotope, mimicking a structural IgE epitope of grass pollen allergen Phl p 5 in an established memory mouse model of acute allergic asthma. In the experimental set-up, BALB/c mice were primed with intraperitoneal injections of recombinant Phl p 5a (rPhl p 5a) and subsequently aerosol challenged with the nebulized allergen. Mice developed signs of bronchial asthma including hypereosinophilia around bronchi, goblet cell hyperplasia and enhanced mucus production. When the mice were subsequently treated with the grass pollen mimotope coupled to keyhole limpet haemocyanin, bronchial eosinophilic inflammation and mucus hypersecretion decreased. Further, a decrease of Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 could be observed in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). In contrast to rPhl p 5a, the mimotope was in vitro not able to stimulate splenocytes to proliferation or IL-5 production. Despite not affecting the levels of pre-existing IgE, vaccination with the single mimotope thus rendered anti-inflammatory effects in a mouse model of acute asthma. From our data, we conclude that vaccination with a mimotope peptide representing a single IgE epitope of the allergen Phl p 5a and being devoid of allergen-specific T cell epitopes is able to down-regulate inflammation in acute asthma.

[Diagnosis of peripheral tuberculous lymphadenitis in Tunisia]. The aim of the study was to evaluate the contribution of microbiology, cytology, and anatomopathology in 50 cases of peripheral tuberculous lymphadenitis. Our patients underwent bacteriological tests and cytology and/or histopathology for lymphadenitis. Ziehl-Neelsen stains and cultures were positive in only 29.7% and 10.8% of cases respectively. The diagnosis was confirmed by cytology in 31.3% of cases (10/32) and by histology in 58.6% of cases (27/46). Granulomas were observed in 46.8% (15/32) of needle aspirates and 76% (35/46) of surgical biopsies. Our study reveals a weak contribution of conventional microbiological techniques. Cytology remains the procedure of choice in endemic countries. Excisional biopsy may be performed in case of doubt.

Diagnosing cochlear dead regions in children. A dead region (DR) is defined as a region in the cochlea where inner hair cells and/or neurons are functioning so poorly that a tone producing peak vibration in this region is detected by off-frequency listening, i.e., via a place on the basilar membrane with a characteristic frequency different from that of the tone. The presence of a DR can have a significant effect on the perception of speech. People with and without DRs may differ in the benefit obtained from amplification and require different hearing aid settings. The Threshold Equalizing Noise (TEN) test and psychophysical tuning curves (PTCs) are two procedures used to identify a DR in adults. Because diagnosing a DR involves measuring masked thresholds, and there are reports in the literature that young children perform poorly compared with adults in background noise, it may be possible that the criteria used with adults may not be appropriate when testing children. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the consistency of the fast-PTC and TEN tests in diagnosing a DR in hearing-impaired children. In addition, the masked thresholds for normal-hearing children were measured with different TEN levels to assess whether any age-related effect in children compared with adults may occur. Participants were divided into two groups: eight normal-hearing children (16 ears) and 12 hearing-impaired children (21 ears), aged 7 to 13 yr. TEN is based on measuring masked threshold in TEN. For normal-hearing participants, the masked thresholds were measured for five levels of noise (30, 40, 50, 60, and 70 dB per averaged equivalent rectangular bandwidth). For hearing-impaired participants, the level of the TEN was selected separately for each ear based on the highest acceptable level minus 5 dB. The TEN test results in hearing-impaired children were further validated by measuring fast-PTCs. The fast-PTC technique involves measuring the level of the narrowband noise masker needed to mask the signal. The center frequency of the masker sweeps across the required frequency range. The masked thresholds in TEN measured for normal-hearing children were usually below and never higher than 5 dB above TEN level per averaged equivalent rectangular bandwidth. This suggests that no age-related effect on masked threshold in children compared with adults was observed. All hearing-impaired children were able to perform the TEN test and fast-PTCs. The results of the two tests were consistent in 17 of 21 ears (81%): eight ears did not show evidence of a DR and nine ears did. In three ears, the criteria for a DR were met on the TEN test, but there was no evidence of a DR on the fast-PTC test. In one ear, the TEN test did not show evidence of DRs at two frequencies, whereas fast-PTCs did. The results of this study suggest that DRs can be detected in children using the fast-PTC technique and the TEN test interpreted with the adult criteria, which are the most appropriate in terms of specificity and sensitivity. However, in cases in which the masked threshold is 10 to 15 dB above the TEN level, it is recommended to confirm DR diagnosis with fast-PTC measurement.

Detection of a new yellow fever virus lineage within the South American genotype I in Brazil. Nucleotide sequences of two regions of the genomes of 11 yellow fever virus (YFV) samples isolated from monkeys or humans with symptomatic yellow fever (YF) in Brazil in 2000, 2004, and 2008 were determined with the objective of establishing the genotypes and studying the genetic variation. Results of the Bayesian phylogenetic analysis showed that sequences generated from strains from 2004 and 2008 formed a new subclade within the clade 1 of the South American genotype I. The new subgroup is here designated as 1E. Sequences of YFV strains recovered in 2000 belong to the subclade 1D, which comprises previously characterized YFV strains from Brazil. Molecular dating analyses suggested that the new subclade 1E started diversifying from 1D about 1975 and that the most recent 2004-2008 isolates arose about 1985.

Idiopathic intrafascicular reentrant left ventricular tachycardia in an elite cyclist athlete. A 32 year-old Caucasian male, an elite athlete, was admitted to the emergency department because of a sudden onset of palpitations which had lasted more than 12 hours and were associated with chest discomfort. He had a two-year history of recurrent stress-induced palpitations. He denied either episodes of syncope or any family history of sudden death. Physical examination was normal. He had no evidence of structural heart disease. The electrocardiography (ECG) documented during the event supported the diagnosis of idiopathic reentrant left ventricular tachycardia. Ventricular tachycardia ablation was successful. This case demonstrates that a careful physical examination and correct ECG diagnosis can lead to an appropriate arrhythmia management.

[A neonate with ambiguous genitalia]. In a neonate with ambiguous genitalia, physical examination revealed a phallus. Ultrasonography showed a vagina and uterus, but no gonads. Because of severe undervirilisation in the presence of a uterus, probably due to 46,XY gonadal dysgenesis, parents were advised female sex assignment. When after a few weeks the phallus had increased in size, abdominal laparoscopy showed an underdeveloped uterus. Gonadal biopsy confirmed gonadal dysgenesis. Sex assignment was reconsidered and changed into the male gender.

DNA-array of gene variants in venous leg ulcers: detection of prognostic indicators.

Effects of pesticides on freshwater diatoms. The study of pesticide effects on algae, and diatoms in particular, was focused on photosynthesis and biomass growth disturbances. Few studies have been performed to investigate the effects of these toxic agents on intracellular structures of diatom cells. Nuclear alterations and cell wall abnormalities were reported for diatoms exposed to toxic compounds. Nevertheless, the cellular mechanisms implicated in the development of such alterations and abnormalities remain unclear. Sensitivity to pesticides is known to be quite different among different diatom species. Eutrophic and small species are recognized for their tolerance to pesticides exposure. More pronounced cell defenses against oxidative stress may explain this absence of sensitivity in species of smaller physical size. Notwithstanding, on the whole, explaining the rationale behind tolerance variations among species has been quite difficult, thus far. In this context, the understanding of intracellular toxicity in diatoms and the relation between these intracellular effects and the disturbance of species composition in communities represent a key target for further research. The original community species structure determines the response of a diatom community to toxic agent exposure. Diatom communities that have species capable of switching from autotrophic to heterotrophic modes, when photosynthesis is inhibited (e.g., after pesticide exposure), can continue to grow, even in the presence of high pesticide pollution. How diatoms respond to toxic stress, and the degree to which they respond, also depends on cell and community health, on ecological interactions with other organisms, and on general environmental conditions. The general structural parameters of diatom communities (biomass, global cell density) are less sensitive to pesticide effects than are the specific structural parameters of the unicellular organisms themselves (cell density by species, species composition). For benthic species, biofilm development and grazing on this matrix as a source of food for invertebrates and fishes may also modify the response of diatom communities. Environmental parameters (light exposure, nutrient concentrations, and hydraulic conditions) affect, and often interfere with, the response of diatoms to pesticides. Therefore, the complexity of aquatic ecosystems and the complexity of pesticide to easily detect the effects of such pollutants on diatoms. Clearly more research will be required to address this problem.

[Update of asthenospermia-related genes and proteins]. One of the most common causes of male infertility is asthenospermia, whose pathogenesis, however, is not yet clear. Recent researches have found that some genes (such as tektin-2, DNAI1, DNAH5, DNAH11, AKAP4, SEPT4 and Smcp) and proteins (such as sperm proteins ACTB, ANXA5, PRM1, PRM2 and SABP and seminal proteins Tf, PSA, PAP and Fractalkine) are associated with asthenospermia. The finding of these molecular markers has provided a base for the explanation of the molecular mechanism of asthenospermia, and these markers may become the diagnostic and therapeutic targets of the disease.

[Effect of dendritic cells pulsed with Talpha146-162 on autoimmune myasthenia graves and the role of B cells activation]. To explore the therapeutic effect of Talpha146-162-iMDCs on C57BL/6 mice with EAMG and the role of changes in B cell activation regulated by Cbl. Thirty four adult male C57BL/6 mice were randomly divided into EAMG group (A group), EAMG group with interventions (B group) and control group (C group). T-AChR antigens were injected to the mice in A and B groups to induce EAMG. Meanwhile, dendritic cells from immature bone marrows were cultured and pulsed with Talpha146-162, and injected to the mice in the intervention group. The mRNA expression of Cbl was detected by RT-PCR 90 days after the termination of experiment. The expression and phosphorylation of Syk and Lyn proteins were measured by Western blot. More mice (9/12, 75%) in A group developed EAMG than in B group (3/12, 25%, P<0.05). Mice in A group also suffered more serious illness in terms of clinical scores than mice in B group (1.69+/-1.12 vs 0.35+/-0.67, P<0.01). No EAMG occurred in mice in C group. Mice in B group had lower mRNA expressions of Cbl in the spleens and lymphonodes than mice in A groups, but both had higher expressions than mice in C group (P<0.05). Mice in B group had higher mRNA expression of Cbl than mice in A group (P<0.05). Talpha146-162-iMDCs prevent EAMG, possibly through negative regulation of Cbl on BCR signaling.

Detrusor after-contraction: a new insight. Detrusor after-contractions (DAC) are non-common in adults. Both definition (nothing in ICS reports) and significance (artefact, link with detrusor overactivity (DO) or bladder outlet obstruction (BOO)) remain discussed. Our purpose was to carry out an analysis of the urodynamic parameters during voidings with DAC and, using the VBN model, to simulate pathophysiological conditions able to explain both voiding phase and DAC. From large urodynamic database of patients referred for evaluation of lower urinary tract dysfunction, DAC were observed in 60 patients (5.7%). Criteria for DAC were post-void residual <30mL and increase of detrusor pressure >10cmH(2)O. VBN model was used for analysis of both pressure and flow curves, and simulations of pathophysiological conditions. Onset of DAC (ODAC) occurred when Q=7.3Â±5.7mL/s and bladder volume=17.9Â±15.4mL. Urgency-frequency syndrome and urodynamic diagnosis of DO were the more frequent scenarios associated with DAC. ODAC was associated to an inversion of the slope of detrusor pressure curve without any perturbation in flow curve. Among tested pathophysiological hypothesis (great, abnormal, detrusor force, sphincter contraction), none allowed restoring all recorded curves (flow rate, voiding pressure and DAC). No urodynamic characteristic of the first part of voiding is an index of occurrence of DAC. ODAC is a significant phenomenon linked with the bladder collapse. DAC is not associated with BOO but more probably with DO and appears as the result of local conditions in an almost empty bladder (concentration of stresses around a transducer); thus DAC seems of weak clinical significance.

Novel/conceptual floating pulsatile system using high internal phase emulsion based porous material intended for chronotherapy. The aim of the present study was to design a novel/conceptual delivery system using ibuprofen, anticipated for chronotherapy in arthritis with porous material to overcome the formulation limits (multiple steps, polymers, excipients) and to optimize drug loading for a desired release profile suitable for in vitro investigations. The objective of this delivery system lies in the availability of maximum drug amount for absorption in the wee hours as recommended. Drug loading using 3(2) factorial design on porous carrier, synthesized by high internal phase emulsion technique using styrene and divinylbenzene, was done via solvent evaporation using methanol and dichloromethane. The system was evaluated in vitro for drug loading, encapsulation efficiency, and surface characterization by scanning electron, atomic force microscopy, and customized drug release study. This study examined critical parameters such as solvent volume, drug amount, and solvent polarity on investigations related to drug adsorption and release mostly favoring low-polarity solvent dichloromethane. Overall release in all batches ranged 0.98-52% in acidic medium and 71-94% in basic medium. These results exhibit uniqueness in achieving the least drug release of 0.98%, an ideal one, without using any release modifiers, making it distinct from other approaches/technologies for time and controlled release and for chronotherapy.

Isotopic composition of formaldehyde in urban air. The isotopic composition of atmospheric formaldehyde was measured in air samples collected in urban Seattle, Washington. A recently developed gas chromatography-isotope ratio mass spectrometry analytical technique was used to extract formaldehyde directly from whole air, separate it from other volatile organic compounds, and measure its (13)C/(12)C and D/H ratio. Measurements of formaldehyde concentration were also made concomitant with isotope ratio. Results of the analysis of nine discrete air samples for delta(13)C-HCHO have a relatively small range in isotopic composition (-31 to -25 per thousand versus VPDB [+/-1.3 per thousand]) over a considerable concentration range (0.8-4.4 ppb [+/-15%]). In contrast, analyses of 17 air samples for deltaD-HCHO show a large range (-296 to +210 per thousand versus VSMOW [+/-50 per thousand]) over the concentrations measured (0.5-2.9 ppb). Observations of deltaD are weakly anticorrelated with concentration. Isotopic data are interpreted using both source- and sink-based approaches. Results of delta(13)C-HCHO are similar to those observed previously for a number of nonmethane hydrocarbons in urban environments and variability can be reconciled with a simple sink-based model. The large variability observed in deltaD-HCHO favors a source-based interpretation with HCHO depleted in deuterium from primary sources of HCHO (i.e., combustion) and HCHO enriched in deuterium from secondary photochemical sources (i.e., hydrocarbon oxidation).

Relationships between early gestures and later language in children with fragile X syndrome. The authors hypothesized that significant positive relationships would exist between early gesture use and later language attainments in children with fragile X syndrome (FXS), as has been reported in studies with other populations. Participants were young children with FXS and limited expressive language (21 boys, 4 girls), divided into 2 subgroups based on the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS; Schopler, Reichler, & Renner, 1988) scores. Data were collected when participants were about 2 years of age and again when they were about 5 years of age. Communication was assessed through the analysis of video samples obtained in the children's homes for both observation periods. Correlational analyses were completed between early prelinguistic communication and later verbal communication scores for all participants and for children with high (>30) versus low (<30) scores on the CARS. Although no significant relationships were found between prelinguistic gesture use and language outcomes for the group of children as a whole, significant negative correlations were found for the group of children who had high CARS scores. These outcomes did not support the authors' initial hypotheses. It was concluded that extensive use of developmentally early gestures by children with FXS who also have many symptoms of autism may not be a positive indicator of later language.

Having a child with asthma--quality of life for Jordanian parents. This study was conducted to assess the quality of life (QoL) of Jordanian parents of children with asthma and its associated factors. Three hundred and twenty-six parents of 200 children participated in the study. The Pediatric Asthma Caregivers' Quality of Life Questionnaire (PACQLQ) was used to measure how parents of children with asthma disease impaired their daily life during the previous week on two domains 'activity limitations' and 'emotional function'. In this study, parents of children with asthma scored their QoL during the past week moderately to the positive end of the scale but they scored more limitations in the domain of activities than in emotions. Parents in the same family scored activity domain fairly similar and there was a significant difference in their scoring of total emotional function. Parents with older children, living in the rural areas, mothers of children with mild asthma were associated with higher QoL. Children received needed daily asthma medication during the preceding week. Asthma medication might mean to the parents that the child was getting the best possible treatment. Further studies to identify the factors that influence QoL of parents of children with asthma in Jordan are needed.


New therapeutic choices for infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.


Protein phosphatase 2A regulatory subunit B56Î± limits phosphatase activity in the heart.

The XPA-binding domain of ERCC1 is required for nucleotide excision repair but not other DNA repair pathways. The endonuclease ERCC1-XPF incises the damaged strand of DNA 5' to a lesion during nucleotide excision repair (NER) and has additional, poorly characterized functions in interstrand cross-link repair, double-strand break repair, and homologous recombination. XPA, another key factor in NER, interacts with ERCC1 and recruits it to sites of damage. We identified ERCC1 residues that are critical for the interaction with XPA and assessed their importance for NER in vitro and in vivo. Mutation of two conserved residues (Asn-110 and Tyr-145) located in the XPA-binding site of ERCC1 dramatically affected NER but not nuclease activity on model DNA substrates. In ERCC1-deficient cells expressing ERCC1(N110A/Y145A), the nuclease was not recruited to sites of UV damage. The repair of UV-induced (6-4)photoproducts was severely impaired in these cells, and they were hypersensitive to UV irradiation. Remarkably, the ERCC1(N110A/Y145A) protein rescues the sensitivity of ERCC1-deficient cells to cross-linking agents. Our studies suggest that ERCC1-XPF engages in different repair pathways through specific protein-protein interactions and that these functions can be separated through the selective disruption of these interactions. We discuss the impact of these findings for understanding how ERCC1 contributes to resistance of tumor cells to therapeutic agents such as cisplatin.

Non-contact respiratory rate measurement validation for hospitalized patients. This paper presents the first clinical results for validating the accuracy of respiratory rate obtained for hospitalized patients using a non-contact, low power 2.4 GHz Doppler radar system. Twenty-four patients were measured in this study. The respiratory rate accuracy was benchmarked against the respiratory rate obtained using Welch Allyn Propaq Encore model 242, the Embla Embletta system with Universal XactTrace respiratory effort sensor and Somnologica for Embletta software, and by counting chest excursions. The 95% limits of agreement between the Doppler radar and reference measurements fall within +/-5 breaths per minute.

Sexual dysfunctions and lower urinary tract symptoms in ankylosing spondylitis. To determine sexual dysfunctions and urinary symptoms in male ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients and their association with various disease and patient factors. In this prospective case control study conducted at a tertiary care teaching institution, 100 males with AS were compared to 100 controls using International Index of Erectile Function-15 (IIEF), International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and a global question for overall relationship with their partners. Bath AS Functional Index (BASFI), visual analogue scale pain scores, patient global assessment scale and Bath AS Disease Activity Index were also assessed in the AS group. Chi-square test, unpaired t-test and univariate and multivariate binary logistic regression analyses were used to analyze the data. Anxiety, depression, erectile dysfunction (ED), orgasmic dysfunction, intercourse dissatisfaction, overall sexual dissatisfaction, altered overall relationship with partner and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the AS group as compared to controls. Sexual desire, severe LUTS and bothersome LUTS (quality of life score > 2) were not different (P = 0.76, 0.82 and 0.30 respectively) between the two groups. ED was associated with anxiety, depression, longer disease duration, higher BASFI and higher age in AS patients (P = 0.02, 0.001, 0.02, 0.003 and 0.001 respectively). AS is associated with higher incidence of sexual dysfunction in male patients. ED is associated with anxiety, depression, longer duration of disease, higher BASFI score and higher age in AS patients.

Smallpox Vaccination of Laboratory Workers at US Variola Testing Sites. To evaluate the need to revaccinate laboratory workers against smallpox, we assessed regular revaccination at the US Laboratory Response Network's variola testing sites by examining barriers to revaccination and the potential for persistence of immunity. Our data do not provide evidence to suggest prolonging the recommended interval for revaccination. 

Characteristics and outcomes of patients undergoing debridement of pancreatic necrosis. Pancreatic necrosis is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The Atlanta Classification underwent proposed revisions in 2007 to better categorize acute pancreatitis. From 1999 to 2008, patients with pancreatic necrosis treated with surgical debridement were analyzed. Computed tomography (CT) images were independently reviewed to classify of pancreatic collections according to the revised Atlanta classification. Seventy-three patients were categorized as infected extrapancreatic necrosis (40%), sterile extrapancreatic necrosis (29%), infected pancreatic necrosis (15%), sterile pancreatic necrosis (11%), or post-necrotic collection (5%). Mortality was 14%, and morbidity was 55%. Debridement with external drainage or open packing was associated with higher mortality than cystgastrostomy (p = 0.03). Atlanta Classification was not associated with operative procedure or mortality. Degree of chronic disease, demonstrated by albumin level, and infection were associated with longer stay (p < 0.05). Type of necrosis by the revised Atlanta Classification was not associated with outcomes or type of operation. Debridement by cystgastrostomy was associated with lower mortality rates than external drainage or open packing. Length of stay was increased in patients with evidence of chronic disease, infection, and postoperative complications. Necrotizing pancreatitis continues to be associated with significant morbidity and mortality and should undergo aggressive treatment at tertiary care centers.

G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunits 1 and 2 are down-regulated in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons and spinal cord after peripheral axotomy. Increased nociceptive neuronal excitability underlies chronic pain conditions. Various ion channels, including sodium, calcium and potassium channels have pivotal roles in the control of neuronal excitability. The members of the family of G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) channels, GIRK1-4, have been implicated in modulating excitability. Here, we investigated the expression and distribution of GIRK1 and GIRK2 in normal and injured dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) and spinal cord of rats. We found that ~70% of the DRG neurons expressed GIRK1, while only <10% expressed GIRK2. The neurochemical profiles of GIRK1- and GIRK2-immunoreactive neurons were characterized using the neuronal markers calcitonin gene-related peptide, isolectin-B4 and neurofilament-200, and the calcium-binding proteins calbindin D28k, calretinin, parvalbumin and secretagogin. Both GIRK subunits were expressed in DRG neurons with nociceptive characteristics. However, while GIRK1 was widely expressed in several sensory neuronal subtypes, GIRK2 was detected mainly in a group of small C-fiber neurons. In the spinal dorsal horn, GIRK1- and -2-positive cell bodies and processes were mainly observed in lamina II, but also in superficial and deeper layers. Abundant GIRK1-, but not GIRK2-like immunoreactivity, was found in the ventral horn (laminae VI-X). Fourteen days after axotomy, GIRK1 and GIRK2 were down-regulated in DRG neurons at the mRNA and protein levels. Both after axotomy and rhizotomy there was a reduction of GIRK1- and -2-positive processes in the dorsal horn, suggesting a presynaptic localization of these potassium channels. Furthermore, nerve ligation caused accumulation of both subunits on both sides of the lesion, providing evidence for anterograde and retrograde fast axonal transport. Our data support the hypothesis that reduced GIRK function is associated with increased neuronal excitability and causes sensory disturbances in post-injury conditions, including neuropathic pain.

Perspectives on the pathophysiology and treatment of sudden idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss. Sudden, idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss is an acute dysfunction of the inner ear whose cause cannot be determined with the currently available methods of clinical diagnosis. This continuous medical education article is based on a selective review of the literature and on the revised S2 guidelines for acute sensorineural hearing loss of the Association of the Scientific Medical Societies in Germany (AWMF), which were issued on 28 January 2009. Recent surveys in Germany suggest that the incidence of sudden, idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss may be as high as 300 per 100,000 persons per year. To distinguish this entity from acute hearing loss of other causes, special tests are necessary, including ear microscopy, pure-tone audiometry, and acoustic evoked response audiometry. No clinical trial of the highest evidence level has yet been published to document the efficacy of any type of treatment for sudden, idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss. Nonetheless, there is evidence from trials with lower levels of evidence, post-hoc analyses, and assessments of secondary endpoints of clinical trials indicating that plasma-expander therapy, the systemic and local (intratympanic) administration of cortisone, and the reduction of acutely elevated plasma fibrinogen levels may be beneficial. Further clinical trials are needed to validate these preliminary results. Until clear data are available, the predicted benefit and risk of any proposed treatment for sudden, idiopathic sensorineural hearing loss should be discussed in detail with the patient before the treatment is begun.

Seasonal Patterns of Buruli Ulcer Incidence, Central Africa, 2002-2012.

Mimetic total coronary sinus occlusion due to superselection with the balloon catheter. A 77-year-old man with dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, QRS duration of 140 ms, and NYHA functional class III was referred for cardiac resynchronization therapy device implantation. Coronary sinus (CS) contrast venography by balloon catheter showed no evidence of tributary veins, mimicking total occlusion of the CS. It was found to be due to superselection of a side branch with the balloon catheter.

Genome Sequence and Architecture of the Tobacco Downy Mildew Pathogen Peronospora tabacina. Peronospora tabacina is an obligate biotrophic oomycete that causes blue mold or downy mildew on tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum). It is an economically important disease occurring frequently in tobacco-growing regions worldwide. We sequenced and characterized the genomes of two P. tabacina isolates and mined them for pathogenicity-related proteins and effector-encoding genes. De novo assembly of the genomes using Illumina reads resulted in 4,016 (63.1 Mb, N50 = 79 kb) and 3,245 (55.3 Mb, N50 = 61 kb) scaffolds for isolates 968-J2 and 968-S26, respectively, with an estimated genome size of 68 Mb. The mitochondrial genome has a similar size (approximately 43 kb) and structure to those of other oomycetes, plus several minor unique features. Repetitive elements, primarily retrotransposons, make up approximately 24% of the nuclear genome. Approximately 18,000 protein-coding gene models were predicted. Mining the secretome revealed approximately 120 candidate RxLR, six CRN (candidate effectors that elicit crinkling and necrosis), and 61 WY domain-containing proteins. Candidate RxLR effectors were shown to be predominantly undergoing diversifying selection, with approximately 57% located in variable gene-sparse regions of the genome. Aligning the P. tabacina genome to Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis and Phytophthora spp. revealed a high level of synteny. Blocks of synteny show gene inversions and instances of expansion in intergenic regions. Extensive rearrangements of the gene-rich genomic regions do not appear to have occurred during the evolution of these highly variable pathogens. These assemblies provide the basis for studies of virulence in this and other downy mildew pathogens.

Mechanisms of mutations in myeloproliferative neoplasms. In recent years, a series of studies have provided genetic insight into the pathogenesis of myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs). It is now known that JAK2V617F mutations are present in 90% of patients with polycythaemia vera (PV), 60% of patients with essential thrombocytosis (ET) and 50% of patients with myelofibrosis (MF). Despite the high prevalence of JAK2V617F mutations in these three myeloid malignancies, several questions remain. For example, how does one mutation contribute to the pathogenesis of three clinically distinct diseases, and how do some patients develop these diseases in the absence of a JAK2V617F mutation? Single nucleotide polymorphisms at various loci and somatic mutations, such as those in MPLW515L/K, TET2 and in exon 12 of JAK2, may also contribute to the pathogenesis of these MPNs. There are likely additional germline and somatic genetic factors important to the MPN phenotype. Additional studies of large MPN and control cohorts with new techniques will help identify these factors.


Retrospective analysis of preoperative embolization of spinal tumors.

Atrial natriuretic peptide modulation of albumin clearance and contrast agent permeability in mouse skeletal muscle and skin: role in regulation of plasma volume. Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) via its guanylyl cyclase-A (GC-A) receptor participates in regulation of arterial blood pressure and vascular volume. Previous studies demonstrated that concerted renal diuretic/natriuretic and endothelial permeability effects of ANP cooperate in intravascular volume regulation. We show that the microvascular endothelial contribution to the hypovolaemic action of ANP can be measured by the magnitude of the ANP-induced increase in blood-to-tissue albumin transport, measured as plasma albumin clearance corrected for intravascular volume change, relative to the corresponding increase in ANP-induced renal water excretion. We used a two-tracer method with isotopically labelled albumin to measure clearances in skin and skeletal muscle of: (i) C57BL6 mice; (ii) mice with endothelium-restricted deletion of GC-A (floxed GC-A x tie2-Cre: endothelial cell (EC) GC-A knockout (KO)); and (iii) control littermates (floxed GC-A mice with normal GC-A expression levels). Comparison of albumin clearances in hypervolaemic EC GC-A KO mice with normovolaemic littermates demonstrated that skeletal muscle albumin clearance with ANP treatment accounts for at most 30% of whole body clearance required for ANP to regulate plasma volume. Skin microcirculation responded to ANP similarly. Measurements of permeability to a high molecular mass contrast agent (35 kD Gadomer) by dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) enabled repeated measures in individual animals and confirmed small increases in muscle and skin microvascular permeability after ANP. These quantitative methods will enable further evaluation of the contribution of ANP-dependent microvascular beds (such as gastro-intestinal tract) to plasma volume regulation.

Clinical definition of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors in non-small-cell lung cancer. Ten percent of North American patients with non-small-cell lung cancer have tumors with somatic mutations in the gene for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Approximately 70% of patients whose lung cancers harbor somatic mutations in exons encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR experience significant tumor regressions when treated with the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) gefitinib or erlotinib. However, the overwhelming majority of these patients inevitably acquire resistance to either drug. Currently, the clinical definition of such secondary or acquired resistance is not clear. We propose the following criteria be used to define more precisely acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs. All patients should have the following criteria: previous treatment with a single-agent EGFR TKI (eg, gefitinib or erlotinib); either or both of the following: a tumor that harbors an EGFR mutation known to be associated with drug sensitivity or objective clinical benefit from treatment with an EGFR TKI; systemic progression of disease (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] or WHO) while on continuous treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib within the last 30 days; and no intervening systemic therapy between cessation of gefitinib or erlotinib and initiation of new therapy. The relatively simple definition proposed here will lead to a more uniform approach to investigating the problem of acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in this unique patient population. These guidelines should minimize reporting of false-positive and false-negative activity in these clinical trials and would facilitate the identification of agents that truly overcome acquired resistance to gefitinib and erlotinib.

Cytotoxic constituents of propolis from Myanmar and their structure-activity relationship. Thirteen cycloartane-type tritepenes (1-13) and four prenylated flavanones (14-17) isolated from propolis collected in Myanmar, were evaluated for their cytotoxic activity against a panel of six different cancer cell lines; three murine cancer cell lines (colon 26-L5 carcinoma, B16-BL6 melanoma, and Lewis lung carcinoma) and three human cancer cell lines (lung A549 adenocarcinoma, cervix HeLa adenocarcinoma and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma). Among them, a cycloartane-type triterpene, 3alpha,27-dihydroxycycloart-24E-en-26-oic acid (3), showed the most potent cytotoxicity against B16-BL6 cells with an IC(50) value of 5.91 microM, comparable to those of positive controls, doxorubicin (IC(50), 5.66 microM) and 5-fluorouracil (IC(50), 4.88 microM). In addition, (2S)-5,7-dihydroxy-4'-methoxy-8,3'-diprenylflavanone (14) exhibited strong cytotoxicity against all the tested cancer cell lines with the IC(50) values ranging from 14.0 to 26.4 microM. Based on the observed results, the structure-activity relationships are discussed.

Characterization of pancreatic cancer and intra-abdominal lymph node malignancy using spectrum analysis of endoscopic ultrasound imaging. This study assessed the ability of spectral analysis of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) RF signals acquired in humans in vivo to distinguish between (1) benign and malignant intraabdominal and mediastinal lymph nodes and (2) pancreatic cancer, chronic pancreatitis, and normal pancreas. Mean midband fit, slope, intercept, and correlation coefficient from a linear regression of the calibrated RF power spectra were computed over regions of interest defined by the endoscopist. Linear discriminant analysis was then performed to develop a classification of the resulting spectral parameters. For lymph nodes, classification based on the midband fit and intercept provided 67% sensitivity, 82% specificity, and 73% accuracy for malignant vs. benign nodes. For pancreas, classification based on midband fit and correlation coefficient provided 95% sensitivity, 93% specificity, and 93% accuracy for diseased vs. normal pancreas and 85% sensitivity, 71% specificity, and 85% accuracy for pancreatic cancer vs. chronic pancreatitis. These promising results suggest that mean spectral parameters can provide a non-invasive method to quantitatively characterize pancreatic cancer and lymph malignancy in vivo.

Use of floating balls for reducing bacterial aerosol emissions from aeration in wastewater treatment processes. The microorganism emissions from aeration in the wastewater treatment process may adversely affect air quality and human health. To control the liquid-to-air transport of microorganisms, commercially available balls were used and their control efficiencies were evaluated by a lab-scale aeration system. Escherichia coli as the test agent were aerosolized by the aeration system and size-fractionated E. coli-containing aerosol samples were collected by using an Andersen six-stage impactor with eosin methylene blue agar for subsequent culturing and enumeration of colonies. Aerosol samples were obtained without any control measure and with balls of four diameters (1.9, 2.9, 3.4 and 4.8 cm) in one, three and five layers covering the bubbling liquid surface. Experimental results showed that the control efficiencies of balls on bacterial aerosols varied from over 50% to nearly 100% under various control settings and substantially increased as the ball size decreased and the number of applied layers increased.

Development of a multi--electrode electrical stimulation device to improve chronic wound healing. A new device has been developed for the application of Electrical Stimulation to improve healing of chronic wounds. The device enables the creation of a composite electrode hence matching the electrode(s) to the size and shape of the wound. Up to 49 electrodes in an array can be combined, delivering High Voltage Pulsed Current (HVPC) in the range 60-120 Hz with a pulse duration range from 90-110 mus and the possibility of treating the patient with direct current instead of HVPC. In addition, the software can import the measurements from the ImpediMap device, analysing the electrical impedance of the tissues involved. A test on healthy volunteers did not prove a statistically significant rise in skin temperature, TcPO2 or impedance due to the stimulation, even though a slight reddening of the stimulated site was observed.

Idiopathic pes cavus in adults is not associated with neurophysiological impairment in the lower limbs. The nerve conduction characteristics of adults with idiopathic pes cavus/hammer toes have not been studied extensively. Among 2048 out-patients (59.5 Â± 13.9 years) referring to a laboratory of Neurophysiology in Rome, we recruited 18 patients with idiopathic pes cavus (61.3 Â± 12.5 years). Fifty-four age/sex-matched controls were also studied. No nerve conduction differences were observed between patients with and without cavus foot (p > 0.05). The absence of deep tendon reflexes and slight muscle weakness and hypotrophy in the lower limbs were more common in subjects with cavus foot deformity than in controls (p < 0.001). Adult patients with idiopathic pes cavus/hammer toes do not differ from healthy controls from a neurophysiological standpoint, but they could show minor signs of clinical impairment, such as lower limb weakness, hypotrophy and areflexia.

Effect of anatomical variability on neural stimulation strength and focality in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST). We present a quantitative comparison of two metrics-neural stimulation strength and focality-in electrocon-vulsive therapy (ECT) and magnetic seizure therapy (MST) using finite-element method (FEM) simulation in a spherical head model. Five stimulation modalities were modeled, including bilateral ECT, unilateral ECT, focal electrically administered seizure therapy (FEAST), and MST with circular and double-cone coils, with stimulation parameters identical to those applied in clinical practice. We further examine the effect on the stimulation metrics of individual-, sex- and age-related variability in tissue layer thickness and conductivity. Neural stimulation by MST is shown to be more focal and superficial than ECT. This result suggests that it may be advantageous to reduce the current used in ECT. The stimulation strength in MST is also less sensitive to variations in head geometry and tissue conductivity than in ECT. Individualization of pulse amplitude in both ECT and MST could compensate for anatomical variability, which could lead to more consistent clinical outcomes.

The role of bone marrow edema and lymphangiogenesis in inflammatory-erosive arthritis. A common feature of autoimmune diseases is the perpetual production of macrophage, dendritic and/or osteoclast effector cells, which mediate parenchymal tissue destruction in end organs. In support of this, we have demonstrated previously that patients and mice with inflammatory-erosive arthritis have a marked increase in circulating CD11b+ precursor cells, which are primed for osteoclastogenesis, and that this increase in osteoclast precursors (OCPs) is due to systemically increased TNF production. From these data, we proposed a unifying hypothesis to explain these osteoimmunologic findings during the pathogenesis of inflammatory-erosive arthritis, which has three postulates: (1) myelopoiesis chronically induced by TNF has profound effects on the bone marrow and joint tissues that should be evident from a longitudinal MRI; (2) TNF alters the chemokine/chemokine receptor axis in the bone marrow to stimulate OCP release into the blood, and (3) OCP-mediated lymphangiogenesis occurs in the end organ as a compensatory mechanism to drain the inflammation and remove by-products of joint catabolism. Here, we describe our recent experimental findings that support these hypotheses and speculate on how this information can be used as diagnostic biomarkers and tools to discover novel therapies to treat patients with inflammatory-erosive arthritis.

Kaposi sarcoma related to an ectopic hypothalamic adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting adenoma: case report. We aim to report a case of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) with Cushing's syndrome caused by endogenic glucocorticoid-induced immunosuppression. A 43-year-old woman presented with delirium, hirsutism, fatigue, and hypertension. At the time of presentation, physical findings showed a Cushingoid appearance, with moon-like facies, hirsutism, and hyperpigmentation. Laboratory findings showed the following: adrenocorticotropic hormone, 86.7 pg/mL (normal range, 0-46 pg/mL); baseline cortisol level, 50 microg/dL (normal range, 6.2-19 microg/dL); potassium, 2.2 mEq/L (normal range, 3.5-5 mEq/L); and midnight cortisol level, 33 microg/dL. Serum cortisol levels failed to suppress after low and high doses of dexamethasone; these findings confirmed the diagnosis of ectopic adrenocorticotropic hormone production. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 12 x 15-mm, round, hypothalamic mass lesion in the center of the median eminence. Endoscopic biopsy from the floor of the third ventricle was performed, and pathological examination of the lesion showed a diffuse adrenocorticotropic hormone-secreting adenoma. The patient developed diffuse skin lesions that were proven to be a KS by skin biopsy while she was prepared for transcranial surgery. After surgical removal of the adenoma, she became hypocortisolemic and required cortisol replacement. Within 1 month after surgery, all KS lesions disappeared spontaneously. Excessive cortisol may induce immunosuppression. KS is one of the most common malignant tumors of patients with immunosuppression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of Cushing's syndrome with KS caused by endogenous glucocorticoid-induced immunosuppression.

Developing outcome measures for serious mental illness; using early intervention as an example. Developing useful outcome measures for the treatment of serious mental illness remains an important challenge for the newly re-configured Mental Health Services in the United Kingdom, towards the latter part of the ten year period covered by the National Service Framework. The present authors have taken the opportunity to develop a method for measuring outcomes in psychotic illness while developing a service for Early Intervention in Psychosis. The results are mentioned shown, but will be discussed in detail elsewhere. This article will focus on the development of the method for measurements which demonstrate functional improvement and improvement in quality of life. We shall show that, in order to measure outcomes, it is necessary to systematically record information from the first presentation of the case, so as later to be able to demonstrate what change has been accomplished. We shall also demonstrate that this activity is part of a necessary ongoing audit activity for services, but that, since there is no certain knowledge of what outcomes could have been expected prior to the implementation of new service developments, it is necessary to include a control group recruited from previous services, in order to establish meaningful benchmarks or norms to which the outcomes of a new service such a control group constitutes audit rather than research, but should be still amenable to statistical analysis. In order to be meaningful, and since serious mental illness may well be chronic, it is necessary that outcome measures should be carried out regularly, after specified periods of time. We also argue for the use of appropriate rating scales, which measure both the number and the intensity of symptoms and for computer base notes in order to facilitate regular audit.

Investigations on the role of base excision repair and non-homologous end-joining pathways in sodium selenite-induced toxicity and mutagenicity in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Selenium (Se) belongs to nutrients that are essential for human health. Biological activity of this compound, however, mainly depends on its dose, with a potential of Se to induce detrimental effects at high doses. Although mechanisms lying behind detrimental effects of Se are poorly understood yet, they involve DNA damage induction. Consequently, DNA damage response and repair pathways may play a crucial role in cellular response to Se. Using Saccharomyces cerevisiae we showed that sodium selenite (SeL), an inorganic form of Se, can be toxic and mutagenic in this organism due to its ability to induce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Moreover, we reported that a spectrum of mutations induced by this compound in the stationary phase of growth is mainly represented by 1-4 bp deletions. Consequently, we proposed that SeL acts as an oxidizing agent in yeast producing oxidative damage to DNA. As short deletions could be anticipated to arise as a result of action of non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and oxidative damage to DNA is primarily coped with base excision repair (BER), a contribution of these two pathways towards survival, DSB induction, mutation frequency and types of mutations following SeL exposure was examined in present study. First, we show that while NHEJ plays no role in repairing toxic DNA lesions induced by SeL, cells with impairment in BER are sensitized towards this compound. Of BER activities examined, those responsible for processing of 3'-blocking DNA termini seem to be the most crucial for manifestation of the toxic effects of SeL in yeast. Second, an impact of NHEJ and BER on DSB induction after SeL exposure turned to be inappreciable, as no increase in DNA double-strand breakage in NHEJ and BER single or NHEJ BER double mutant upon SeL exposure was observed. Finally, we demonstrate that impairment in both these pathways does not importantly change mutation frequency after SeL exposure and that NHEJ is not responsible for generation of short deletions after SeL treatment, as these were comparably induced in the wild-type and NHEJ-defective cells.

Radon hazard in shallow groundwaters: amplification and long term variability induced by rainfall. (222)Rn concentrations have been determined with a RAD7 radon detector in shallow groundwaters of the Pietramelara Plain, north-western Campania, southern Italy, where pyroclastic deposits, along with recent stream alluvial sediments, come in contact with Mesozoic carbonate reservoirs. The aim of this study has been to study the annual variation of (222)Rn concentration in the shallow groundwaters, scarcely considered in the literature and of obvious relevance for radon hazard evaluation. Our results definitely show that (222)Rn levels are characterized by a clear annual periodicity, strictly related to rainfall and water table levels, with a pronounced difference between the dry and the wet season. In this last case with concentrations increasing up to two orders of magnitude (up to two times the lower threshold given in the Recommendation 2001/928/EURATOM for public waters). In relation to this, experimental field data will be presented to demonstrate that this variability is due to purely hydrological mechanisms, mainly rinse out and discharge that control leaching efficiency. The detected cycle (Radon Hydrological Amplification Cycle, RHAC) has been generalized for the Mediterranean Tyrrhenian climate. The marked and seasonally persistent amplification in (222)Rn levels poses the problem of evaluating the epidemiological risk brought up by this previously not yet reported mechanism. This mechanism, occurring in shallow groundwaters, very likely should strongly influence indoor radon levels via groundwater-soil-building exchange.

[One case report of tracheo-innominate artery fistula responsible of massive haemoptysis in a tracheotomized patient: which strategy to adopt?]. The tracheo-innominate artery fistula is a rare but life-threatening complication of the tracheotomy. Its care management requires a rapid airway control to allow haemostasis by compression and ventilation. The haemostasis must be immediate and two techniques exist: surgery opencast (sternotomy) or interventional radiology. The choice between the two depends largely on the technical platform available. Our case report describes a tracheo-innomninate artery fistula surgically managed with success. The patient carried an anatomic variant, the two carotids come from innominate artery.

Changes in extracellular kynurenic acid concentrations in rat prefrontal cortex after D-kynurenine infusion: an in vivo microdialysis study. Using a microdialysis technique, we continuously infused D-kynurenine (KYN) (0, 50, and 100 microM) into the prefrontal cortices (PFCs) of male Sprague-Dawley rats. We then used column-switching high-performance liquid chromatography to assess the alterations in the concentration of kynurenic acid (KYNA)-an antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate and alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors-in the extracellular fluid in the PFC. Local infusion of D-KYN into the PFC remarkably increased the extracellular KYNA concentration, indicating that D-KYN is metabolized to KYNA in the PFC. The D-KYN-induced increase in KYNA levels was significantly attenuated by the co-administration of 3-methylpyrazole-5-carboxylic acid (AS057278)-a specific inhibitor of D-amino acid oxidase (DAAO). These results suggest that DAAO may be involved in the production of KYNA from D-KYN in the PFC in vivo.

The implantable electrical stimulator is usually not suitable for long term use because of its large size and short battery life, besides the magnetic stimulation can not provide deep nerve stimulation. Therefore, this paper developed a method of the electrical stimulation by using the magnetic induction. We implanted a small inductive coil which was connected with nerve electrodes. When the stimulation was applied, a coaxial coil containing a pulsed current was placed outside. So the electrical field evoking the nerve was formed because of the generation of inductive electromotive force in the inductive coil. Finite element analysis was used to analyze the electric field in the nerve and fiber model was used to predict the generation of action potential. This innovative method was applied on the sciatic nerves of rats. EMG was successfully recorded after the electrical stimulation by the magnetic induction. The results demonstrated that this new method was effective to stimulate the deep nerve.

'Smart' nanoparticles as drug delivery systems for applications in tumor therapy. In the therapy of clinical diseases such as cancer, it is important to deliver drugs directly to tumor sites in order to maximize local drug concentration and reduce side effects. This objective may be realized by using 'smart' nanoparticles (NPs) as drug delivery systems, because they enable dramatic conformational changes in response to specific physical/chemical stimuli from the diseased cells for targeted and controlled drug release. In this review, we first briefly summarize the characteristics of 'smart' NPs as drug delivery systems in medical therapy, and then discuss their targeting transport, transmembrane and endosomal escape behaviors. Lastly, we focus on the applications of 'smart' NPs as drug delivery systems for tumor therapy. Biodegradable 'smart' NPs have the potential to achieve maximum efficacy and drug availability at the desired sites, and reduce the harmful side effects for healthy tissues in tumor therapy. It is necessary to select appropriate NPs and modify their characteristics according to treatment strategies of tumor therapy.


Metabolic activities of biotechnological interest in Yarrowia lipolytica grown on glycerol in repeated batch cultures.

Anomalous surplus energy transfer observed with multiple FRET acceptors. FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a mechanism where energy is transferred from an excited donor fluorophore to adjacent chromophores via non-radiative dipole-dipole interactions. FRET theory primarily considers the interactions of a single donor-acceptor pair. Unfortunately, it is rarely known if only a single acceptor is present in a molecular complex. Thus, the use of FRET as a tool for measuring protein-protein interactions inside living cells requires an understanding of how FRET changes with multiple acceptors. When multiple FRET acceptors are present it is assumed that a quantum of energy is either released from the donor, or transferred in toto to only one of the acceptors present. The rate of energy transfer between the donor and a specific acceptor (k(D-->A)) can be measured in the absence of other acceptors, and these individual FRET transfer rates can be used to predict the ensemble FRET efficiency using a simple kinetic model where the sum of all FRET transfer rates is divided by the sum of all radiative and non-radiative transfer rates. The generality of this approach was tested by measuring the ensemble FRET efficiency in two constructs, each containing a single fluorescent-protein donor (Cerulean) and either two or three FRET acceptors (Venus). FRET transfer rates between individual donor-acceptor pairs within these constructs were calculated from FRET efficiencies measured after systematically introducing point mutations to eliminate all other acceptors. We find that the amount of energy transfer observed in constructs having multiple acceptors is significantly greater than the FRET efficiency predicted from the sum of the individual donor to acceptor transfer rates. We conclude that either an additional energy transfer pathway exists when multiple acceptors are present, or that a theoretical assumption on which the kinetic model prediction is based is incorrect.

A preliminary study of action potential propagation in paretic muscle of stroke survivors. Individual motor unit action potential (MUAP) propagation along the muscle fibers was assessed in paretic muscle of stroke survivors. Single motor unit activity was recorded from the biceps brachii muscle on the paretic side of stroke survivors using a surface electrode array. Among the 15 clearly identified low-threshold motor units, six units showed little delay between MUAPs on different electrodes aligned along muscle fibers, resulting in abnormally high values of calculated propagation velocities, while clear action potential delay was observed for the other motor units. Several factors that possibly lead to this observation are discussed.

Ligand-induced conformation changes drive ATP hydrolysis and function in SMARCAL1. Mutations and deletions in SMARCAL1, an SWI2/SNF2 protein, cause Schimke immuno-osseous dysplasia (SIOD). SMARCAL1 preferentially binds to DNA molecules possessing double-stranded to single-stranded transition regions and mediates annealing helicase activity. The protein is critical for alleviating replication stress and maintaining genome integrity. In this study, we have analysed the ATPase activity of three mutations â A468P, I548N and S579L â present in SIOD patients. These mutations are present in RecA-like domain I of the protein. Analysis using active DNA-dependent ATPase A domain (ADAAD), an N-terminal deleted construct of bovine SMARCAL1, showed that all three mutants were unable to hydrolyse ATP. Conformational studies indicated that the Î±-helix and Î²-sheet content of the mutant proteins was altered compared to the wild-type protein. Molecular simulation studies confirmed that major structural changes had occurred in the mutant proteins. These changes included alteration of a loop region connecting motif Ia and II. As motif Ia has been implicated in DNA binding, ligand binding studies were done using fluorescence spectroscopy. These studies revealed that the Kd for protein-DNA interaction in the presence of ATP was indeed altered in the case of mutant proteins compared to the wild-type. Finally, in vivo studies were done to complement the in vitro and in silico studies. The results from these experiments demonstrate that mutations in human SMARCAL1 that result in loss in ATPase activity lead to increased replication stress and therefore possibly manifestation of SIOD.

Improved asthma control with breath-actuated pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI): the SYSTER survey. Poor inhalation technique may impact both asthma control and compliance in patients with asthma. The SYSTER survey is therefore aimed at assessing the influence of starting or switching an existing therapy to a breath-actuated pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI, Autohaler) on these parameters. 709 French general practitioners (GP) enrolled 2588 asthmatic patients in whom therapy with the breath-actuated pMDI was either initiated, or a switch from an existing inhalation device to the said inhaler was deemed necessary. Asthma control was assessed at inclusion and after 4 weeks of treatment with the Juniper Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ). In addition, patient adherence was estimated according to the self-reported Morisky scale. 1510 patients (mean age 39 years, standard deviation 18 years; 53% male) completed follow-up after 4 weeks. The main reasons for inhaler change were poor asthma control (49%) and poor coordination (40%). After 4 weeks of therapy with the breath-actuated pMDI, asthma control significantly improved from 2.35 +/- 1.05 to 1.32 +/- 0.93 in the ACQ (p < 0.0001). Also, self-reported patient adherence improved from 2.11 +/- 1.43 to 1.57 +/- 1.53 on the Morisky scale (p < 0.0001). These results suggest that by focusing on the inhalation devices, asthma control and compliance with treatment are improved.

Croup presentations to emergency departments in Alberta, Canada: a large population-based study.

Trimethyltin chloride induced chloride secretion across rat distal colon. TMT (trimethyltin chloride), an organotin, is ubiquitous in the environment. The consumption of contaminated food may cause exposure of the human diet to this toxic compound. The present study was to investigate the effects of TMT on the regulation of ion transport across the rat distal colon. The rat colonic mucosa was mounted in Ussing chambers. The effects of TMT were assessed using the Isc (short-circuit current). Both apical and basolateral TMT induced, dose-dependently, an increase in Isc, which was due to a stimulation of Cl- secretion as measured using ion substitution experiments and pharmacological manoeuvres. The secretion was also inhibited by several K+ channel blockers administrated at the basolateral side. When the apical side was permeabilized by nystatin, the TMT-induced K+ conductance was effectively blocked by tetrapentylammonium, a Ca2+-sensitive K+ channel blocker. The response of TMT was sensitive to the basolateral Ca2+ and the intracellular Ca2+ store, which could be disclosed by applying the inhibitors of ryanodine receptors and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors. In conclusion, TMT led to Cl- secretion, which was essentially regulated by basolateral Ca2+-sensitive K+ channels. These results suggest the importance of K+ channels in the toxicity hazard of TMT.

The functional anatomy of human cardiac valves and unique visualization of transcatheter-delivered valves being deployed. The reanimation of large mammalian hearts, including those of humans, using Visible Heart methodologies provides a unique perspective of functional cardiac anatomy. This knowledge is critical for design engineers and clinicians who seek less invasive cardiac repair approaches for patients with acquired or congenital structural heart defects.

Update and critique of natural remedies as antidepressant treatments. The popularity of natural or "alternative" remedies to treat medical and psychiatric disorders has accelerated dramatically over the past decade, in the United States and worldwide. This article reviews the evidence for clinical efficacy, active ingredients, mechanisms of action, recommended dosages, and toxicities of the 3 best-studied putative natural antidepressants, St. John's wort (hypericum), S-adenosyl methionine, and the Omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. Despite growing evidence for efficacy and safety, more comprehensive studies are required before these remedies can be recommended as safe and effective alternatives or adjuncts to conventional psychotropic agents. There are limited data regarding safety in pregnancy and during lactation, and caution is therefore recommended in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

Successful treatment with Yokukansan for behavioral and psychological symptoms of Parkinsonian dementia. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Yokukansan, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, for treating behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) in patients with Parkinson disease (PD; n=7) and those with PD with dementia (PDD; n=7). BPSD are often seen in patients with senile dementia and have serious deleterious effects on the lives of patients and caregivers. Recent studies indicate that the traditional Chinese herbal medicine Yokukansan may be safe and beneficial for the treatment of BPSD patients. We treated 7 PD and 7 PDD patients for 4 weeks with Yokukansan and observed them without Yokukansan for 4 weeks. Changes in behavioral and psychological symptoms were evaluated every 4 weeks according to the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) scale. Significant improvements in behavioral and psychological symptoms, particularly in the incidence and duration of hallucinations, were observed in most PD and PDD patients after 4 weeks of Yokukansan treatment. No significant changes were observed in the laboratory tests, cognitive function, activities of daily living, or parkinsonism. Our results suggest that Yokukansan improves BPSD in both PD and PDD patients without worsening their cognitive function, ability to perform activities of daily living, or parkinsonism.

Calcium activity in different classes of myenteric neurons underlying the migrating motor complex in the murine colon. The spontaneous colonic migrating motor complex (CMMC) is a cyclical contractile and electrical event that is the primary motor pattern underlying fecal pellet propulsion along the murine colon. We have combined Ca(2+) imaging with immunohistochemistry to determine the role of different classes of myenteric neurons during the CMMC. Between CMMCs, myenteric neurons usually displayed ongoing but uncoordinated activity. Stroking the mucosa at the oral or anal end of the colon resulted in a CMMC (latency: 6 to 10 s; duration: 28 s) that consisted of prolonged increases in activity in many myenteric neurons that was correlated to Ca(2+) transients in and displacement of the muscle. These neurons were likely excitatory motor neurons. Activity in individual neurons during the CMMC was similar regardless of whether the CMMC occurred spontaneously or was evoked by anal or oral mucosal stimulation. This suggests that convergent interneuronal pathways exist which generate CMMCs. Interestingly, Ca(2+) transients in a subset of NOS +ve neurons were substantially reduced during the CMMC. These neurons are likely to be inhibitory motor neurons that reduce their activity during a complex (disinhibition) to allow full excitation of the muscle. Local stimulation of the mucosa evoked synchronized Ca(2+) transients in Dogiel Type II (mitotracker/calbindin-positive) neurons after a short delay (1-2 s), indicating they were the sensory neurons underlying the CMMC. These local responses were observed in hexamethonium, but were blocked by ondansetron (5-HT(3) antagonist), suggesting Dogiel Type II neurons were activated by 5-HT release from enterochromaffin cells in the mucosa. In fact, removal of the mucosa yielded no spontaneous CMMCs, although many neurons (NOS +ve and NOS ve) exhibited ongoing activity, including Dogiel Type II neurons. These results suggest that spontaneous or evoked 5-HT release from the mucosa is necessary for the activation of Dogiel Type II neurons that generate CMMCs.

Contribution of ClpE to virulence of Streptococcus pneumoniae. The ATP-dependent caseinolytic proteases (Clp) play a fundamental role in stress tolerance and virulence in many pathogenic bacteria. Although ClpE of Streptococcus pneumoniae is required for growth at high temperatures, little is known about the role of ClpE in pathogenesis. In this study, we observed that the virulence of the clpE mutant of S. pneumoniae strain D39 was strongly reduced in a mouse intraperitoneal infection model. The clpE mutant also showed substantially reduced adherence to the human lung epithelial carcinoma A549 cell line and human umbilical-vein-derived endothelial cells. The underlying mechanism of virulence attenuation induced by the mutation of clpE was further investigated with real-time RT-PCR and 2-dimensional protein gel analysis. The results indicate that ClpE affects pneumococcal pathogenesis by modulating the expression of some important virulence determinants and metabolism-related factors in S. pneumoniae.

Hydroxyproline-containing dipeptides and tripeptides quantified at high concentration in human blood after oral administration of gelatin hydrolysate. Several hydroxyproline (Hyp)-containing food-derived collagen peptides were identified in human blood after oral ingestion of gelatin hydrolysates. However, these types of peptides were not quantified in human plasma. In this report, a sensitive LC-MS/MS method was introduced for simultaneous quantitative analysis of Hyp-containing peptides. All peptide concentrations were determined accurately, with all coefficients of determination (r(2)) >0.999. The method achieved detection and quantification limits of 0.01 pmol/ml and 12.5-1,000 pmol/ml in plasma, respectively. Concentrations were quantified for nine Hyp-containing peptides in human plasma by this method, identifying Pro-Hyp (C(max) = 60.65 +/- 5.74 nmol/ml) as the major constituent of food-derived collagen peptides, while the minor components were Ala-Hyp-Gly, Ser-Hyp-Gly, Ala-Hyp, Phe-Hyp, Leu-Hyp, Ile-Hyp, Gly-Pro-Hyp, and Pro-Hyp-Gly (C(max) from 23.84 to 0.67 nmol/ml). Thus a total of nine Hyp-containing peptides in human plasma were successfully quantified by this approach. The concentration of Hyp-containing peptides is substantially higher than that following oral administration of other peptides.

Dynamic acclimation of photosynthesis increases plant fitness in changing environments. Plants growing in different environments develop with different photosynthetic capacities--developmental acclimation of photosynthesis. It is also possible for fully developed leaves to change their photosynthetic capacity--dynamic acclimation. The importance of acclimation has not previously been demonstrated. Here, we show that developmental and dynamic acclimation are distinct processes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dynamic acclimation plays an important role in increasing the fitness of plants in natural environments. Plants of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were grown at low light and then transferred to high light for up to 9 d. This resulted in an increase in photosynthetic capacity of approximately 40%. A microarray analysis showed that transfer to high light resulted in a substantial but transient increase in expression of a gene, At1g61800, encoding a glucose-6-phosphate/phosphate translocator GPT2. Plants where this gene was disrupted were unable to undergo dynamic acclimation. They were, however, still able to acclimate developmentally. When grown under controlled conditions, fitness, measured as seed output and germination, was identical, regardless of GPT2 expression. Under naturally variable conditions, however, fitness was substantially reduced in plants lacking the ability to acclimate. Seed production was halved in gpt2- plants, relative to wild type, and germination of the seed produced substantially less. Dynamic acclimation of photosynthesis is thus shown to play a crucial and previously unrecognized role in determining the fitness of plants growing in changing environments.

Tizanidine does not affect the linear relation of stretch duration to the long latency M2 response of m. flexor carpi radialis. The long latency M2 electromyographic response of a suddenly stretched active muscle is stretch duration dependent of which the nature is unclear. We investigated the influence of the group II afferent blocker tizanidine on M2 response characteristics of the m. flexor carpi radialis (FCR). M2 response magnitude and eliciting probability in a group of subjects receiving 4 mg of tizanidine orally were found to be significantly depressed by tizanidine while tizanidine did not affect the significant linear relation of the M2 response to stretch duration. The effect of tizanidine on the M2 response of FCR is supportive of a group II afferent contribution to a compound response of which the stretch duration dependency originates from a different mechanism, e.g., rebound Ia firing.

The use of Cytokeratin 19 (CK19) immunohistochemistry in lesions of the pancreas, gastrointestinal tract, and liver. Cytokeratin immunostaining forms the bedrock of the immunohistochemical evaluation of tumors. Cytokeratin 19 (CK19) belongs to a family of keratins, which are normally expressed in the lining of the gastroenteropancreatic and hepatobiliary tracts. CK19 immunohistochemistry has been used successfully in thyroid tumors to recognize papillary carcinomas for some time. However, its use in the pancreas, liver, and gastrointestinal tract (GIT) has only recently come to the fore. The purpose of this review is to look at the use of CK19 immunohistochemistry in tumors occurring at these sites. CK19 has been shown to be an independent prognostic factor for pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, especially the insulin-negative tumors. CK19 positive tumors are associated with poor outcome irrespective of the established pathologic parameters such as size, mitoses, lymphovascular invasion, and necrosis. It is recommended that CK19 be part of the immunohistochemical panel in the work-up of pancreatic endocrine tumors. CK19 is positive in the most of neuroendocrine tumors occurring in the rest of the GIT, except rectal tumors, which are negative. In the liver, CK19 is of prognostic value in hepatocellular carcinomas and is of use in distinguishing cholangiocarcinoma from hepatocellular carcinomas. It can also be used to highlight native ductules in the liver and helps separate conditions such as focal nodular hyperplasia from hepatic adenoma. The vast majority of adenocarcinomas in the GIT and pancreas are CK19 positive.

Ten-year experience with nephrogenic systemic fibrosis: case-control analysis of risk factors. To analyze all cases of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) at our institution and to compare them with controls. After the institutional review board approval, 13 biopsy-proven NSF cases were identified. Ten cases had complete records and were compared in a case-control format with 10 age- and sex-matched, dialysis-dependent controls. Analyzed risk factors included single and cumulative gadolinium dose, medication and transplant history, and serum electrolytes at the time of gadolinium exposure. There were 1.9% of dialysis-dependent, gadolinium-exposed patients who developed NSF. There was no difference in gadolinium dose, transplant history, or serum electrolytes. Seven of 10 cases and 3 of 10 controls were treated with erythropoietin (P = 0.13). At the time of NSF diagnosis, 7 of 10 cases were on immunosuppressive therapy. Two of 7 cases developed NSF only after immunosuppressive therapy was initiated. Two of 10 controls were on immunosuppressive therapy (P = 0.06). All cases of NSF occurred in dialysis-dependent, gadolinium-exposed patients. Associations between immunosuppressive and erythropoietin therapies and NSF need further investigation.

A FGF3 mutation associated with differential inner ear malformation, microtia, and microdontia. Analysis of association between genotype and phenotype. Prospective genetic study in a family. Auditory investigations, computer tomography, and genetic sequencing of the fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3) gene were performed on a Somali family presenting with autosomal recessive, hearing impairment, microdontia, and outer ear morphologies ranging from normal auricle development to microtia assessed as type 1 Weerda dysplasia in affected individuals. Computed tomography imaging identified differential inter- and intraindividual malformations of the inner ear including labyrinth aplasia, development of a common cavity to the presence of a cochlear with 1.5 windings (Mondini malformation) in affected individuals, symptoms similar to those described as labyrinth aplasia, microtia, and microdontia (LAMM) syndrome, caused by mutations in FGF3. Genetic sequencing revealed the presence of a novel p.R95W missense mutation in FGF3 segregating with pathology. The p.R95W mutation substitutes a positively charged arginine for a polar tryptophan in the highly conserved RYLAM consensus of the beta 6 sheet of FGF3 that interacts with FGFR2. These findings describe, for the first time, variable inner ear malformations and outer ear dysplasia in the presence of constant microdontia, associated with homozygous inheritance of the p.R95W mutation in FGF3, mirroring phenotypes observed in mouse models ablating FGF3/FGFR2 signaling.

The effect of shortening history on isometric and dynamic muscle function. Despite numerous reports on isometric force depression, few reports have quantified force depression during active muscle shortening (dynamic force depression). The purpose of this investigation was to determine the influence of shortening history on isometric force following active shortening, force during isokinetic shortening, and velocity during isotonic shortening. The soleus muscles of four cats were subjected to a series of isokinetic contractions at three shortening velocities and isotonic contractions under three loads. Muscle excursions initiated from three different muscle lengths but terminated at a constant length. Isometric force produced subsequent to active shortening, and force or shortening velocity produced at a specific muscle length during shortening, were compared across all three conditions. Results indicated that shortening history altered isometric force by up to 5%, force during isokinetic shortening up to 30% and shortening velocity during isotonic contractions by up to 63%. Furthermore, there was a load by excursion interaction during isotonic contractions such that excursion had the most influence on shortening velocity when the loads were the greatest. There was not a velocity by excursion interaction during isokinetic contractions. Isokinetic and isotonic power-velocity relationships displayed a downward shift in power as excursions increased. Thus, to discuss force depression based on differences in isometric force subsequent to active shortening may underestimate its importance during dynamic contractions. The presence of dynamic force depression should be realized in sport performance, motor control modeling and when controlling paralyzed limbs through artificial stimulation.


Does price transparency legislation allow the uninsured to shop for care?

The diet quality of rural older adults in the South as measured by healthy eating index-2005 varies by ethnicity. The 2005 Dietary Guidelines for Americans publication placed increased emphasis on the importance of consuming a wide range of healthful foods and further reducing the consumption of less healthful ones. These recommendations are challenging for rural elders whose functional limitations, fewer resources, and limited access to foods negatively affect the quality of their diets. The purpose of this study was to characterize the diet quality of a multiethnic population-based sample of older adults (N=635) in the southern United States. Data were collected via home visit; dietary intakes were assessed using a food frequency questionnaire and converted into Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005) scores used to monitor adherence to dietary guidelines. The mean total HEI-2005 score was 61.9/100 with fewer than 2% meeting the recommended score of 80/100. After controlling for age, sex, marital status, poverty status, and education, African Americans (n=136) had higher total HEI-2005 scores compared to American Indians (n=195) and non-Hispanic whites (n=304) (64.5 vs 60.1 and 61.1 respectively, P=0.001). Certain HEI-2005 foods were consumed in greater amounts by particular groups, such as total fruit and meat and beans (African Americans), whole fruit and grains (African Americans and American Indians), milk (non-Hispanic whites), and energy from solid fat, alcohol, and added sugars (American Indians). The overall diet quality of these rural elders was not adequate as determined by the HEI-2005; however, intakes of dark green and orange vegetables were adequate, and many participants were in compliance with the added fat and sugar guidelines. Determination of factors that promote or prevent the consumption of healthful foods among rural elders may help tailor nutrition education programs for these vulnerable communities.

Synthesis and in vitro opioid receptor functional antagonism of methyl-substituted analogues of (3R)-7-hydroxy-N-[(1S)-1-{[(3R,4R)-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dimethyl-1-piperidinyl]methyl}-2-methylpropyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (JDTic). In previous structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies, (3R)-7-hydroxy-N-[(1S)-1-{[(3R,4R)-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dimethyl-1-piperidinyl]methyl}-2-methylpropyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-3-isoquinolinecarboxamide (JDTic, 3) was identified as the first potent and selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist from the trans-3,4-dimethyl-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)piperidine class of opioid antagonists. In the present study, we report the synthesis of analogues 8a-p of 3 and present their in vitro opioid receptor functional antagonism using a [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding assay. Compounds 8a-p are analogues of 3 containing one, two, or three methyl groups connected to the JDTic structure at five different positions. All the analogues with one and two added methyl groups with the exception of 8k had subnanomolar K(e) values at the kappa receptor. The three most potent analogues were the monomethylated (3R)-7-hydroxy-N-[(1S,2S)-1-{[(3R,4R)-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dimethylpiperidine-1-yl]methyl}-2-methylbutyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxamide (8a) and (3R)-7-hydroxy-N-[(1S)-1-{[(3R,4R)-4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3,4-dimethylpiperidin-1-yl]methyl}-(2-methylpropyl)]-3-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxamide (8e) with K(e) values of 0.03 nM at the kappa receptor and (3R)-7-hydroxy-N-[(1S)-1-{[(3R,4R)-4-(3-methoxyphenyl)-3,4-dimethylpiperidin-1-yl]methyl}-2-methylpropyl]-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxamide (8d) with K(e) = 0.037 nM at the kappa receptor. All three compounds were selective for the kappa receptor relative to the micro and delta receptors. Overall, the results from this study highlight those areas that are tolerant to substitution on 3.

Papilledema Outcomes from the Optical Coherence Tomography Substudy of the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial. To assess treatment efficacy using spectral-domain (SD) optical coherence tomography (OCT) measurements of papilledema in the Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension Treatment Trial (IIHTT), which evaluated the effects of acetazolamide and weight management and of placebo and weight management in eyes with mild visual loss. Randomized double-masked control clinical trial of acetazolamide plus weight management compared with placebo plus weight management in subjects with mild visual field loss and previously untreated idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Eighty-nine (43 acetazolamide treated, 46 placebo treated) of 165 subjects meeting IIHTT entry criteria. Subjects underwent perimetry, papilledema grading (FrisÃ©n method), high- and low-contrast visual acuity, and SD OCT imaging at study entry and 3 and 6 months. Study eye results (worse perimetric mean deviation [PMD]) were used for most analyses. Retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness, total retinal thickness (TRT), optic nerve (ONH) volume, and retinal ganglion cell layer (RGCL) measurements derived using 3-dimensional segmentation. Study entry OCT values were similar in both treatment groups. At 6 months, the acetazolamide group had greater reduction than the placebo group for RNFL thickness (175 Î¼m vs. 89 Î¼m; PÂ = 0.001), TRT (220 Î¼m vs. 113 Î¼m; PÂ = 0.001), and ONH volume (4.9 mm(3) vs. 2.1 mm(3); PÂ = 0.001). The RNFL thickness (PÂ = 0.01), TRT (PÂ = 0.003), and ONH volume (PÂ = 0.002) measurements also showed smaller increases in subjects who lost 6% or more of study entry weight. The acetazolamide (3.6 Î¼m) and placebo (2.1 Î¼m) groups showed minor RGCL thinning (PÂ = 0.06). The RNFL thickness, TRT, and ONH volume measurements showed moderate correlations (rÂ = 0.48-0.59; P â¤ 0.0001) with FrisÃ©n grade. The 14 eyes with RGCL thickness less than the fifth percentile of controls had worse PMD (PÂ = 0.001) than study eyes with RGCL in the fifth percentile or more. In IIH, acetazolamide and weight loss effectively improve RNFL thickness, TRT, and ONH volume swelling measurements resulting from papilledema. In contrast to the strong correlation at baseline, OCT measures at 6 months show only moderate correlations with papilledema grade.

The endogenous siRNA pathway is involved in heterochromatin formation in Drosophila. A new class of small RNAs (endo-siRNAs) produced from endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) precursors was recently shown to mediate transposable element (TE) silencing in the Drosophila soma. These endo-siRNAs might play a role in heterochromatin formation, as has been shown in S. pombe for siRNAs derived from repetitive sequences in chromosome pericentromeres. To address this possibility, we used the viral suppressors of RNA silencing B2 and P19. These proteins normally counteract the RNAi host defense by blocking the biogenesis or activity of virus-derived siRNAs. We hypothesized that both proteins would similarly block endo-siRNA processing or function, thereby revealing the contribution of endo-siRNA to heterochromatin formation. Accordingly, P19 as well as a nuclear form of P19 expressed in Drosophila somatic cells were found to sequester TE-derived siRNAs whereas B2 predominantly bound their longer precursors. Strikingly, B2 or the nuclear form of P19, but not P19, suppressed silencing of heterochromatin gene markers in adult flies, and altered histone H3-K9 methylation as well as chromosomal distribution of histone methyl transferase Su(var)3-9 and Heterochromatin Protein 1 in larvae. Similar effects were observed in dcr2, r2d2, and ago2 mutants. Our findings provide evidence that a nuclear pool of TE-derived endo-siRNAs is involved in heterochromatin formation in somatic tissues in Drosophila.

Hydrous silica coatings: occurrence, speciation of metals, and environmental significance. Si-enriched coatings form on the surface of silicate minerals under acidic conditions. Although they are often only a few nanometers thick, their large specific surface area may control the interaction between silicate minerals in acidic soils, aquifers, and mine tailings. Micrometer thick, hydrous-silica coatings occur on the surface of a granite outcrop in contact with acidic pond water at the Coppercliff mine-tailings area in the Greater City of Sudbury, Ontario, and are ideal to study the concentration and speciation of metals and metalloids inside Si-enriched coatings. These coatings have higher average concentrations of Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Pb than coatings composed of schwertmannite, Fe(8)O(8)(OH)(4.4)(SO(4))(1.8) (H(2)O)(8.4). Microscopic and spectroscopic examination of the hydrous-silica coating indicates the occurrence of Fe- and Cu-Zn-oxy-hydroxide particles, tetrahedrally coordinated Fe(3+) and a high proportion of M-O-Si bonds (M = metal). These observations suggest that metals occur either finely distributed in the hydrous-silica matrix or in oxy-hydroxide particles. The latter particles are products of the diffusion of metals into the hydrous silica and the subsequent nucleation of oxy-hydroxide phases.

ADAMTS13 gene deletion aggravates ischemic brain damage: a possible neuroprotective role of ADAMTS13 by ameliorating postischemic hypoperfusion. Reperfusion after brain ischemia causes thrombus formation and microcirculatory disturbances, which are dependent on the platelet glycoprotein Ib-von Willebrand factor (VWF) axis. Because ADAMTS13 cleaves VWF and limits platelet-dependent thrombus growth, ADAMTS13 may ameliorate ischemic brain damage in acute stroke. We investigated the effects of ADAMTS13 on ischemia-reperfusion injury using a 30-minute middle cerebral artery occlusion model in Adamts13(-/-) and wild-type mice. After reperfusion for 0.5 hours, the regional cerebral blood flow in the ischemic cortex was decreased markedly in Adamts13(-/-) mice compared with wild-type mice (P < .05), which also resulted in a larger infarct volume after 24 hours for Adamts13(-/-) compared with wild-type mice (P < .01). Thus, Adamts13 gene deletion aggravated ischemic brain damage, suggesting that ADAMTS13 may protect the brain from ischemia by regulating VWF-platelet interactions after reperfusion. These results indicate that ADAMTS13 may be a useful therapeutic agent for stroke.

Imaging of systemic vasculitis in childhood. The term "systemic vasculitis" encompasses a diverse set of diseases linked by the presence of blood-vessel inflammation that are often associated with critical complications. These diseases are uncommon in childhood and are frequently subjected to a delayed diagnosis. Although the diagnosis and treatment may be similar for adult and childhood systemic vasculitides, the prevalence and classification vary according to the age group under investigation. For example, Kawasaki disease affects children while it is rarely encountered in adults. In 2006, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the Pediatric Rheumatology European Society (PReS) proposed a classification system for childhood vasculitis adopting the system devised in the Chapel Hill Consensus Conference in 1993, which categorizes vasculitides according to the predominant size of the involved blood vessels into small, medium and large vessel diseases. Currently, medical imaging has a pivotal role in the diagnosis of vasculitis given recent developments in the imaging of blood vessels. For example, early diagnosis of coronary artery aneurysms, a serious complication of Kawasaki disease, is now possible by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart and multidetector computed tomography (MDCT); positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) helps to assess active vascular inflammation in Takayasu arteritis. Our review offers a unique approach using the integration of the proposed classification criteria for common systemic childhood vasculitides with their most frequent imaging findings, along with differential diagnoses and an algorithm for diagnosis based on common findings. It should help radiologists and clinicians reach an early diagnosis, therefore facilitating the ultimate goal of proper management of affected children. 

Crop and non-crop productivity in a traditional maize agroecosystem of the highland of Mexico. In Mexico, the traditional maize cultivation system has resisted intensification attempts for many decades in some areas, even in some well-connected regions of the temperate highlands. We suggest that this is due to economics. The total useful biomass of several fields in Nanacamilpa, Tlaxcala, are evaluated for productivity and costs. Maize grain production is low (1.5 t ha(-1)) and does not cover costs. However, maize stover demands a relatively high price. If it included, a profit is possible (about 110 US $ ha(-1)). We show that non-crop production (weeds for food and forage) potentially has a higher value than the crop. It is only partially used, as there are constraints on animal husbandry, but it diversifies production and plays a role as a back-up system in case of crop failure. The diversified system described is economically rational under current conditions and labor costs. It is also stable, low-input and ecologically benign, and should be recognized as an important example of integrated agriculture, though some improvements could be investigated.

Sun Protection Belief Clusters: Analysis of Amazon Mechanical Turk Data. This study aimed (i) to determine whether people could be differentiated on the basis of their sun protection belief profiles and individual characteristics and (ii) explore the use of a crowdsourcing web service for the assessment of sun protection beliefs. A sample of 500 adults completed an online survey of sun protection belief items using Amazon Mechanical Turk. A two-phased cluster analysis (i.e., hierarchical and non-hierarchical K-means) was utilized to determine clusters of sun protection barriers and facilitators. Results yielded three distinct clusters of sun protection barriers and three distinct clusters of sun protection facilitators. Significant associations between gender, age, sun sensitivity, and cluster membership were identified. Results also showed an association between barrier and facilitator cluster membership. The results of this study provided a potential alternative approach to developing future sun protection promotion initiatives in the population. Findings add to our knowledge regarding individuals who support, oppose, or are ambivalent toward sun protection and inform intervention research by identifying distinct subtypes that may best benefit from (or have a higher need for) skin cancer prevention efforts.

Gastric Emptying in the Elderly. Aging is characterized by a diminished homeostatic regulation of physiologic functions, including slowing of gastric emptying. Gastric and small intestinal motor and humoral mechanisms in humans are complex and highly variable: ingested food is stored, mixed with digestive enzymes, ground into small particles, and delivered as a liquefied form into the duodenum at a rate allowing efficient digestion and absorption. In healthy aging, motor function is well preserved whereas deficits in sensory function are more apparent. The effects of aging on gastric emptying are relevant to the absorption of oral medications and the regulation of appetite, postprandial glycemia, and blood pressure. 


The influence of cardiac rehabilitation on inflammation and metabolic syndrome in women with coronary heart disease.

An automated method to segment the femur for osteoarthritis research. In this paper we develop a fully automated method for the segmentation of the femur in axial MR images and its use in the analysis of imaging biomarkers for osteoarthritis (OA). The proposed method is based on anatomical constraints implemented using morphological operations to extract the femur medulla and a level set evolution to extract the femur cortex. The average agreement of the automated segmentation algorithm with ground truth manual segmentations was 0.94 +/- 0.03 calculated using the Zijdenbos similarity index (ZSI). A pooled variance t-test analysis found significant associations between the KL grade, a clinical measure of OA severity, and both the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the femur medulla (p = 0.02) and the ratio of the femur medulla CSA to the femur cortex CSA (p = 0.04) for women. No significant association between femur measurements and KL grade was found for men.

Risk of serotonin syndrome with complementary and alternative medicines: importance to child and adolescent psychiatry. Evaluate how child and adolescent psychiatrists rate themselves regarding their knowledge and clinical skills in assessing interactions between non-prescribed complementary and alternative medicines (CAM) and prescribed medications. A brief questionnaire about the practice of asking patients about CAM use was given to child and adolescent psychiatrists. The questionnaire was completed by 20 child and adolescent psychiatrists. Only 35% of the sample stated that they always asked about CAM use although 55% stated that they aware of the importance of prescribed drug interactions with CAM. Of the sample, 90% stated that they could recognize serotonin syndrome, but only 65% answered correctly to the description of the syndrome. Given a list of possible CAM that could interact with prescribed drugs to produce serotonin syndrome, only 10% identified all the drugs correctly. CAM training should be included in training programs and in continued education curriculums for practicing child psychiatrists.

Association between suicidal behaviour and impaired glucose metabolism in depressive disorders. Disturbances in lipid metabolism have been linked to suicidal behaviour, but little is known about the association between suicide risk and abnormal glucose metabolism in depression. Hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia may increase the risk of depression and also the risk for suicide, we therefore studied associations between suicidal behaviour and disturbances in glucose metabolism in depressive patients who had been referred to depression nurse case managers. Patients aged 35 years and older (N = 448, mean age 51 years) who were experiencing a new depressive episode, who were referred to depression nurse case managers in 2008-2009 and who scored â¥10 on the Beck Depression Inventory were enrolled in this study. The study was conducted in municipalities within the Central Finland Hospital District (catchment area of 274 000 inhabitants) as part of the Finnish Depression and Metabolic Syndrome in Adults study. The patients' psychiatric diagnoses and suicidal behaviour were confirmed by the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. Blood samples, for glucose and lipid determinations, were drawn from participants after 12 h of fasting, which was followed by a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) when blood was drawn at 0 and 2 h. Insulin resistance was measured by the Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) method. Suicidal ideation (49 %) and previous suicide attempts (16 %) were common in patients with major depressive disorder or dysthymia. Patients with depression and suicidal behaviour had higher blood glucose concentrations at baseline and at 2 hours in the OGTT. Glucose levels associated positively with the prevalence of suicidal behaviour, and the linearity was significant at baseline (p for linearity: 0.012, adjusted for age and sex) and for 2-hour OGTT glucose (p for linearity: 0.004, adjusted for age and sex). QUICKI levels associated with suicidal behavior (p for linearity across tertiles of QUICKI: 0.026). Total and LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels were also higher in those patients with suicidal behaviour. Multivariate analysis revealed that blood glucose levels, BDI scores and antidepressive medications associated with suicidal behaviour. Insulin resistance and disturbances in glucose and lipid metabolism may be more common in middle-aged depressive patients with suicidal behaviour.

NanoART synthesis, characterization, uptake, release and toxicology for human monocyte-macrophage drug delivery. Factors limiting the efficacy of conventional antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection include treatment adherence, pharmacokinetics and penetration into viral sanctuaries. These affect the rate of viral mutation and drug resistance. In attempts to bypass such limitations, nanoparticles containing ritonavir, indinavir and efavirenz (described as nanoART) were manufactured to assess macrophage-based drug delivery. NanoART were made by high-pressure homogenization of crystalline drug with various surfactants. Size, charge and shape of the nanoparticles were assessed. Monocyte-derived macrophage nanoART uptake, drug release, migration and cytotoxicity were determined. Drug levels were measured by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. Efficient monocyte-derived macrophage cytoplasmic vesicle uptake in less than 30 min based on size, charge and coating was observed. Antiretroviral drugs were released over 14 days and showed dose-dependent reduction in progeny virion production and HIV-1 p24 antigen. Cytotoxicities resulting from nanoART carriage were limited. These results support the continued development of macrophage-mediated nanoART carriage for HIV-1 disease.

Scope of super-resolution in central vision. The term super-resolution refers to computational enhancement of detail in sets of similar images, particularly undersampled images. Undersampling is a key feature of visual disorders associated with neuroretinal matrix damage. It is conceivable that a neurophysiological equivalent of super-resolution might be recruited in these settings. The need for sets of similar images might be satisfied by augmenting retinal image movements. Monocular letter acuity thresholds were measured by computer graphics in normal subjects, with and without controlled test target movements. Various degrees of neuroretinal matrix defects were simulated by superposing stationary masks on the test targets. Static acuity thresholds increased monotonically with increased mask densities. The addition of target movement partially counteracted the threshold increment. The effect was barely measurable at small mask densities and increased monotonically to a gain of approximately two lines on a decimal acuity scale with masks simulating loss of 90% of neural matrix elements. Similar results were obtained from a patient with an acquired neuroretinal matrix defect, attesting to the validity of the mask experiments. Super-normal retinal image movements have subtle effects on visual resolution in normal eyes, whereas eyes with neuroretinal matrix defects may improve markedly. This finding may have implications for the development of aids for the visually handicapped.

The need for specialized preanesthesia clinics for day admission cardiac and major vascular surgery patients. The majority of patients undergoing surgical procedures today are not admitted to the hospital prior to the morning of surgery. In a medical world that strives not only for patient safety, but also for cost containment, Day Admission Surgery (DAS) plays an important role in our healthcare systems. This is true even for patients undergoing cardiac and major vascular (CMV) procedures. However, CMV patients often present with more complicated pre-, intra- and post-operative issues than other surgical patients.In order to optimize the preoperative evaluation and care of CMV patients, we developed a specialized Pre-Anesthesia Clinic (PAC). We believed that patients, surgeons, anesthesiologists, and intensive care unit (ICU) teams would all benefit when appropriate preoperative evaluations are thoughtfully performed by those specializing in the care of these complicated patients. Planning for this specialized clinic included a survey of other institutions' practices. Following initiation of our clinic, we performed a patient satisfaction survey. We report these findings along with the demographic data concerning the patients and types of surgeries evaluated in our initial experience. Finally, we discuss the preoperative evaluation including various areas of assessment provided by our PAC.

A microarray analysis of sex- and gonad-biased gene expression in the zebrafish: evidence for masculinization of the transcriptome. In many taxa, males and females are very distinct phenotypically, and these differences often reflect divergent selective pressures acting on the sexes. Phenotypic sexual dimorphism almost certainly reflects differing patterns of gene expression between the sexes, and microarray studies have documented widespread sexually dimorphic gene expression. Although the evolutionary significance of sexual dimorphism in gene expression remains unresolved, these studies have led to the formulation of a hypothesis that male-driven evolution has resulted in the masculinization of animal transcriptomes. Here we use a microarray assessment of sex- and gonad-biased gene expression to test this hypothesis in zebrafish. By using zebrafish Affymetrix microarrays to compare gene expression patterns in male and female somatic and gonadal tissues, we identified a large number of genes (5899) demonstrating differences in transcript abundance between male and female Danio rerio. Under conservative statistical significance criteria, all sex-biases in gene expression were due to differences between testes and ovaries. Male-enriched genes were more abundant than female-enriched genes, and expression bias for male-enriched genes was greater in magnitude than that for female-enriched genes. We also identified a large number of genes demonstrating elevated transcript abundance in testes and ovaries relative to male body and female body, respectively. Overall our results support the hypothesis that male-biased evolutionary pressures have resulted in male-biased patterns of gene expression. Interestingly, our results seem to be at odds with a handful of other microarray-based studies of sex-specific gene expression patterns in zebrafish. However, ours was the only study designed to address this specific hypothesis, and major methodological differences among studies could explain the discrepancies. Regardless, all of these studies agree that transcriptomic sex differences in D. rerio are widespread despite the apparent absence of heterogamety. These differences likely make important contributions to phenotypic sexual dimorphism in adult zebrafish; thus, from an evolutionary standpoint, the precise roles of sex-specific selection and sexual conflict in the evolution of sexually dimorphic gene expression are very important. The results of our study and others like it set the stage for further work aimed at directly addressing this exciting issue in comparative genomics.


Potassium channels: the 'master switch' of renal fibrosis?

Stochastic resonance can enhance information transmission of supra-threshold neural signals. Stochastic resonance (SR) has been shown to improve detection of sub-threshold signals with additive uncor-related background noise, not only in a single hippocampal CA1 neuron model, but in a population of hippocampal CA1 neuron models (Array-Enhanced Stochastic Resonance; AESR). However, most of the information in the CNS is transmitted through supra-threshold signals and the effect of stochastic resonance in neurons on these signals is unknown. Therefore, we investigate through computer simulations whether information transmission of supra-threshold input signal can be improved by uncorrelated noise in a population of hippocampal CA1 neuron models by supra-threshold stochastic resonance (SSR). The mutual information was estimated as an index of information transmission via total and noise entropies from the inter-spike interval (ISI) histograms of the spike trains generated by gathering each of spike trains in a population of hippocampal CA1 neuron models at N = 1, 2, 4, 10, 20 and 50. It was shown that the mutual information was maximized at a specific amplitude of uncorrelated noise, i.e., a typical curve of SR was observed when the number of neurons was greater than 10 with SSR. However, SSR did not affect the information transfer with a small number of neurons. In conclusion, SSR may play an important role in processing information such as memory formation in a population of hippocampal neurons.

A high-affinity inhibitor of human CD59 enhances complement-mediated virolysis of HIV-1: implications for treatment of HIV-1/AIDS. Many pathogenic enveloped viruses, including HIV-1, escape complement-mediated virolysis by incorporating host cell regulators of complement activation into their own viral envelope. The presence of complement regulators including CD59 on the external surface of the viral envelope confers resistance to complement-mediated virolysis, which may explain why human pathogenic viruses such as HIV-1 are not neutralized by complement in human fluids, even in the presence of high Ab titers against the viral surface proteins. In this study, we report the development of a recombinant form of the fourth domain of the bacterial toxin intermedilysin (the recombinant domain 4 of intermedilysin [rILYd4]), a 114 aa protein that inhibits human CD59 function with high affinity and specificity. In the presence of rILYd4, HIV-1 virions derived from either cell lines or peripheral blood mononuclear cells of HIV-1-infected patients became highly sensitive to complement-mediated lysis activated by either anti-HIV-1 gp120 Abs or by viral infection-induced Abs present in the plasma of HIV-1-infected individuals. We also demonstrated that rILYd4 together with serum or plasma from HIV-1-infected patients as a source of anti-HIV-1 Abs and complement did not mediate complement-mediated lysis of either erythrocytes or peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results indicate that rILYd4 may represent a novel therapeutic agent against HIV-1/AIDS.

[Sexual orientation and mental health: a review]. The aim of this paper is to review available knowledge on sexual orientation and mental health, especially for women. Papers published in English or French, between 1997 and 2007, were selected in PubMed using the following keywords "homosexuality/sexual orientation and mental health/depression/suicide". To be retained, papers had to contain findings from quantitative surveys comparing homosexual and heterosexual adults. In all, this review analyses 22 papers including two that are based on the same survey. This review found a general pattern of poorer mental health for homosexuals and even more so for bisexuals compared to heterosexuals. Results are especially consistent regarding elevated risk of suicide attempts.

Patch-basis electrocortical source imaging in epilepsy. In this study, we developed numerical methods for investigating the sources of epileptic activity from intracranial EEG recordings acquired from intracranial subdural electrodes (iEEG) in patients undergoing pre-surgical evaluation at the epilepsy center of the Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN). The data were analyzed using independent component analysis (ICA), which identifies and isolates maximally independent signal components in multi-channel recordings. A realistic individual head model was constructed for a patient undergoing pre-surgical evaluation. Structural models of gray matter, white matter, CSF, skull, and scalp were extracted from pre-surgical MR and post-surgical CT images. The electromagnetic source localization forward problem was solved using the Boundary Element Method (BEM). Source localization was performed using the Sparse Bayesian Learning (SBL) algorithm. The multiscale patch-basis source space constructed for this purpose includes a large number of dipole elements on the cortical layer oriented perpendicular to the local cortical surface. These source dipoles are combined into overlapping multi-scalepatches. Using this approach, we were able to detect seizure activity on sulcal walls and on gyrus of the cortex.

Evaluation of an error-reduction training program for surgical residents. To reduce errors in surgery using a resident training program based on a taxonomy that highlights three kinds of errors: judgment, inattention to detail, and problem understanding. The training program module at the University of South Florida incorporated a three-item situational judgment test, video training (which included a lecture and behavior modeling), and role-plays (in which residents participated and received feedback from faculty). Two kinds of outcome data were collected from 33 residents during 2006-2007: (1) behaviors during the training and (2) on-the-job surgical complication records 12 months before and 6 months after training. For the data collected during training, participants were assigned to a condition (19 video condition, 13 control condition); for the data collected on the job, an interrupted time series design was used. Data from 32 residents were analyzed (one resident's data were excluded). One of the situational judgment items improved significantly over time (d = 0.45); the other two did not (d = 0.36, 0.25). Surgical complications and errors decreased over the course of the study (the correlation between complications and time in months was r = -0.47, for errors and time, r = -0.55). Effects of video behavior modeling on specific errors measured during role-plays were not significant (effect sizes for binary outcomes were phi = -0.05 and phi = 0.01, and for continuous outcomes, d ranged from -0.02 to 0.34). The training seemed to reduce errors in surgery, but the training had little effect on the specific kinds of errors targeted during training.

Therapeutic effect of genetically engineered mesenchymal stem cells in rat experimental leptomeningeal glioma model. Disseminating disease of high grade gliomas is difficult to treat. We examined the therapeutic effect of intrathecal administration of mesenchymal stem cells transduced with herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase gene (MSCtk) followed by systemic ganciclovir (GCV) administration in rat experimental leptomeningeal glioma model. First, to examine in vivo bystander effect, rats were intrathecally co-injected with a mixture of MSCtk and C6 cells and then, intraperitoneally administered with GCV or saline for 10days (co-injection model). Next, to examine the therapeutic effect of MSCtk/GCV therapy, MSCtk cells were intrathecally administered 1day after C6 injection and then, GCV or saline was administered (treatment model). GCV administration significantly reduced tumor size on day 14 both in the co-injection model (0.41+/-0.22 vs. 3.10+/-0.97mm(2), p<0.01) and in the treatment model (0.73+/-.29 vs. 2.84+/-0.82mm(2), p<0.01). Survival was also significantly prolonged in GCV group both in the co-injection model (29.2+/-3.3 vs. 18.8+/-0.8days, p<0.001) and in the treatment model (21.5+/-1.5 vs. 17.2+/-0.5days, p<0.001). This study provided a novel treatment strategy for leptomeningeal glioma dissemination using intrathecal MSCtk injection followed by systemic GCV administration.

Radiosurgery in the treatment of spinal metastases: tumor control, survival, and quality of life after helical tomotherapy. The effectiveness and limitations of spinal radiosurgery using a helical TomoTherapy system for the treatment of spinal metastases are reviewed in this article. This is a retrospective review of patients who underwent stereotactic radiosurgery for spinal metastases between July 2004 and December 2007. Radiographic follow-up consisted of magnetic resonance imaging to assess tumor growth control as well as pre- and posttreatment x-rays, which were used to measure changes in segmental angulation and deformity. Clinical performance was assessed using the Karnofsky Performance Scale, Oswestry Disability Index, and visual analog scale. Forty patients were treated for 110 metastatic tumors (range, 1-6 tumors per patient). The mean age at the time of radiosurgical treatment was 67 years (age range, 35-81 years). Twenty-three patients (57.5%) had undergone previous surgical resection. Pain was the most common presenting symptom, seen in 32 patients (80%). The mean Oswestry Disability Index score at presentation was 43 (range, 20-90), and the mean visual analog scale score was 6.2 (range, 0-10). The mean radiosurgical dose to the tumor was 17.3 Gy (range, 10-24 Gy). At a mean follow-up duration of 12.7 months (range, 4-32 months), decreased or stable tumor volume was seen in 90 (82%) of the tumors treated. There was improvement in pain in 34 patients (85%). The mean postradiosurgical Oswestry Disability Index score was 25 (range, 10-90), whereas the postradiosurgical visual analog scale score was 3.2 (range, 0-9). Progression of kyphosis was the most common radiographic sequela, experienced by 73% of patients alive at 12 months, with a mean change in angulation of 7.3 +/- 4.5 degrees. Radiosurgery is effective as either primary or adjunctive treatment of metastatic tumors of the spine.

Pre-exposure prophylaxis for men and transgender women who have sex with men in Brazil: opportunities and challenges. The World Health Organization recently released guidelines on the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for prevention of HIV infection among men and transgender women (TGW) who have sex with men based on results of randomized clinical trials. The aim of this commentary is to discuss the opportunities and challenges of incorporating PrEP into the Brazilian continuum of HIV care and prevention for men who have sex with men (MSM) and TGW. Key aspects of the AIDS epidemic among MSM and TGW in Brazil and the comprehensive Brazilian response to the epidemic are presented. The universal access to health care provided through the Brazilian Unified Health System (SUS) and the range of prevention and care services already available countrywide to HIV-positive individuals and at-risk MSM and TGW are identified as the main facilitators for the implementation of PrEP. Limited PrEP awareness among MSM, TGW and health care providers, low HIV testing frequency and low HIV risk perception among MSM and TGW represent the core challenges to be addressed. Data generated by demonstration projects in Brazil will provide an important contribution to PrEP rollout in Brazil. The implementation of PrEP in Brazil is feasible. A synergistic rollout of treatment as prevention and PrEP will maximize public health and individual benefits of the country's comprehensive response to the AIDS epidemic.

Wrist Actigraphy: A Simple Way to Record Motor Activity in Elderly Patients with Dementia and Apathy or Aberrant Motor Behavior. In dementia, behavioral psychological symptoms are frequent and variable. To assess the value of wrist actigraphy as a measure of disorder in motor behavior especially apathy, aberrant motor behavior, agitation and anxiety. Cross sectional observational study of consecutive patients older than 75 years admitted to an intermediate care unit of a geriatric hospital ward during a two-year period. Psycho behavioral symptoms and cognitive status were assessed using the NPI scale and MMSE and diagnosis of dementia was done using DSMIV criteria. A wrist actigraph was worn for 10 days to record motor activity, sleep time and number of periods of sleep. 183 patients were included. Among patients with dementia, a significant decrease in motor activity was recorded in those with apathy from 9h to 12h and 18h to 21h (p <0.05) and in those with anxiety from 21h to 24h (p <0.05). Aberrant motor behavior in dementia was associated with a significant increase in motor activity from 21h to 24h (p <0.01). Agitation was not associated with a significant differences in motor activity. Wrist actigraphy can be used to record motor activity in elderly patients with dementia especially in those with apathy and aberrant motor behavior.

EMG analysis of concurrent activation potentiation. This study evaluated the effect of remote voluntary contractions(RVC) on concentric isokinetic knee extensor and flexor peak torque, rate of torque development, power, and work, the activation of the affected muscles, and gender differences therein. Eleven men and 12 women were evaluated with EMG and isokinetic dynamometry during knee extension and flexion tests in RVC and baseline (NO-RVC) test conditions. The RVC condition included jaw clenching, hand gripping, and the Valsalva maneuver. A two-way mixed ANOVA with repeated measures for test condition was used to evaluate the main effects for each isokinetic measure, as well as the EMG of the prime movers, their antagonist,and the muscles involved in the RVC, and the interaction between test condition and gender. Significant interactions between test condition and gender indicate differences in response to RVC during knee extension tests for power and work (P < or = 0.05) and for knee flexion tests for peak torque and power (P < or = 0.05). All subjects produced higher peak torque and power during knee extension in the RVC condition (P < or = 0.05). Men produced a higher rate of torque development and work during knee extension (P < or = 0.05) and a higher peak torque and power during knee flexion in the RVC condition (P < or = 0.05). Prime mover activation was greater in the RVC condition for most tests (P < or = 0.05). Women demonstrated lower bilateral flexor digitorum superficialis activation than men during all tests in the RVC condition (P < or = 0.05). RVC increased the performance of several outcome variables assessed, which coincides with the concomitant increase in EMG of the prime movers.

Current tests for the diagnosis of these diseases are based on the detection of an abnormal misfolded form of the host protein PrP which is found within the central nervous and lymphoreticular systems of affected animals. Recently, concern that this marker may not be as reliable as previously thought, coupled with an urgentneed for a pre-clinical live animal test, has led to the search for alternative assays for the detection of TSE disease. This "proof of concept" study, examines the use of differential protein expression profiling using surface enhanced laser desorption and ionisationtime of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF) for the diagnosis of TSE disease. Spectral output from all proteins selectively captured from individual murine brain homogenate samples, are compared as "profiles" in groups of infected and non-infected animals. Differential protein expression between groups is thus highlighted and statistically significant protein "peaks" used to construct a panel of disease specific markers.Studies at both terminal stages of disease and throughout the time course of disease have shown a disease specific protein profile or "disease fingerprint" which could be used to distinguish between groups of TSE infected and uninfected animals at an early time point of disease. Our results show many differentially expressed proteins in diseased and control animals, some at early stages of disease. Three proteins identified by SELDI-TOF analysis were verified by immunohistochemistry in brain tissue sections. We demonstrate that by combining the most statistically significant changes in expression, a panel of markers can be constructed that can distinguish between TSE diseased and normal animals. Differential protein expression profiling has the potential to be used for the detection of disease in TSE infected animals. Having established that a "training set" of potential markers can be constructed, more work would be required to further test the specificity and sensitivity of the assay in a "testing set". Based on these promising results, further studies are being performed using blood samples from infected sheep to assess the potential use of SELDI-TOF as a pre-mortem blood based diagnostic.


Serum ropivacaine concentrations and systemic local anesthetic toxicity in trauma patients receiving long-term continuous peripheral nerve block catheters.

Molecular strain typing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates to detect cross-contamination events. Proposed modifications to prevent its recurrence. To investigate possible cross-contamination events of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures, and also to shed light on cross-contamination problems in our laboratories. At the TB Research Unit in the Department of Comparative Medicine Research Centre of King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Centre, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we received 22 TB isolates sub-cultured on Lowenstein-Jensen media from a local laboratory in Riyadh on 1st July 2005. We finger printed all 22 isolates in question using a polymerase chain reaction-based spoligotype molecular technique. The epidemiological and clinical data were reviewed. All 22 cases had been proven to be cross-contaminated as a result of processing all specimens using a contaminated buffer. All of these patients had no clinical course consistent with tuberculosis. The discordant clinical pictures, and a deoxyribonucleic acid fingerprint that matches those of other culture-positive specimens processed concurrently, in addition to a lack of an epidemiological link between the patients suggest cross-contamination events. Using molecular techniques has become an absolute necessity to detect cross-contamination events in our laboratory, to prevent the deleterious consequences of cross-contamination in patients.

Liquid extraction surface analysis field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry mass spectrometry for the analysis of dried blood spots. Liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA) is a surface sampling technique that allows electrospray mass spectrometry analysis of a wide range of analytes directly from biological substrates. Here, we present LESA mass spectrometry coupled with high field asymmetric waveform ion mobility spectrometry (FAIMS) for the analysis of dried blood spots on filter paper. Incorporation of FAIMS in the workflow enables gas-phase separation of lipid and protein molecular classes, enabling analysis of both haemoglobin and a range of lipids (phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin species) from a single extraction sample. The work has implications for multiplexed clinical assays of multiple analytes. 

Mitochondrial genomes are retained by selective constraints on protein targeting. Mitochondria are energy-producing organelles in eukaryotic cells considered to be of bacterial origin. The mitochondrial genome has evolved under selection for minimization of gene content, yet it is not known why not all mitochondrial genes have been transferred to the nuclear genome. Here, we predict that hydrophobic membrane proteins encoded by the mitochondrial genomes would be recognized by the signal recognition particle and targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum if they were nuclear-encoded and translated in the cytoplasm. Expression of the mitochondrially encoded proteins Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1, Apocytochrome b, and ATP synthase subunit 6 in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells confirms export to the endoplasmic reticulum. To examine the extent to which the mitochondrial proteome is driven by selective constraints within the eukaryotic cell, we investigated the occurrence of mitochondrial protein domains in bacteria and eukaryotes. The accessory protein domains of the oxidative phosphorylation system are unique to mitochondria, indicating the evolution of new protein folds. Most of the identified domains in the accessory proteins of the ribosome are also found in eukaryotic proteins of other functions and locations. Overall, one-third of the protein domains identified in mitochondrial proteins are only rarely found in bacteria. We conclude that the mitochondrial genome has been maintained to ensure the correct localization of highly hydrophobic membrane proteins. Taken together, the results suggest that selective constraints on the eukaryotic cell have played a major role in modulating the evolution of the mitochondrial genome and proteome. 

[Effects of probucol, aspirin and atorvastatin combination therapy upon atherosclerosis]. To investigate the effects of probucol, aspirin and atorvastatin (PAS) combination therapy upon atherosclerosis. A total of 436 patients with coronary artery disease were selected and randomly divided into control group (aspirin 100 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg daily) and PAS group (aspirin 100 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg and probucol 0.25 g daily). After a 1-year treatment course, 378 cases remained in the study (201 in control group vs. 177 in PAS group). These patients were followed for throughout the study course and their serum levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL), ox-LDL, TXB2 and MMP-9 were measured at 6 and 12 months respectively. Twenty cases were diagnosed with carotid artery plaque by carotid ultrasound and 16 cases remained in the PAS group. They were followed with ultrasound for plaque thickness. In the control group, the pre-treatment level of MMPs and ox-LDL were not statistically different from the post-treatment level (P > 0.05). In the PAS group, the pre-treatment level of ox-LDL was (23.46 +/- 0.01) mmol/L and the post-treatment level (16.13 +/- 0.02) mmol/L. There was a decrease of 31.7% (P < 0.05). The pre-treatment level of MMPs and MMP-9 in the control group was not statistically different from the post-treatment level. The pre-treatment level of MMP-9 in the PAS group was (7.15 +/- 0.01) mmol/L and the post-treatment level (4.19 +/- 0.02) mmol/L. There was a decrease of 42.4% (P < 0.05). During the course of follow-up, the hospitalization rate, angina recurrence rate, myocardial infarction rate and mortality rate for the control group were 23 (11.4%), 28 (13.9%), 4 (2.0%) and 2 (1.0%) respectively. In the PAS group, the corresponding values were 6 (3.4%), 13 (7.3%), 1 (0.6%) and 0 respectively. All parameters of adverse events showed a significant decrease in the PAS group (P < 0.05). Among the cases with carotid plaque, the pretreatment measurements of intima thickness and plaque thickness were (0.103 +/- 0.002) cm and (0.248 +/- 0.001) cm while the post-treatment corresponding measurements (0.097 +/- 0.001) cm and (0.209 +/- 0.002) cm respectively. There was a significant difference between the PAS group and the control group (P < 0.05). Antioxidant probucol significantly inhibits the generation of ox-LDL and MMP-9. PAS therapy also reduces the plaque thickness and decreases the rate of adverse event in patients with atherosclerosis. Antioxidants can be considered as a new adjunct therapy in the treatment of atherosclerosis.

Impact of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, 2004 to 2014. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) was established in 2004 to facilitate the development of effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) by validating biomarkers for AD clinical trials. We searched for ADNI publications using established methods. ADNI has (1) developed standardized biomarkers for use in clinical trial subject selection and as surrogate outcome measures; (2) standardized protocols for use across multiple centers; (3) initiated worldwide ADNI; (4) inspired initiatives investigating traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder in military populations, and depression, respectively, as an AD risk factor; (5) acted as a data-sharing model; (6) generated data used in over 600 publications, leading to the identification of novel AD risk alleles, and an understanding of the relationship between biomarkers and AD progression; and (7) inspired other public-private partnerships developing biomarkers for Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. ADNI has made myriad impacts in its first decade. A competitive renewal of the project in 2015 would see the use of newly developed tau imaging ligands, and the continued development of recruitment strategies and outcome measures for clinical trials.

Quantitative nuclear proteomics identifies mTOR regulation of DNA damage response. Cellular nutritional and energy status regulates a wide range of nuclear processes important for cell growth, survival, and metabolic homeostasis. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) plays a key role in the cellular responses to nutrients. However, the nuclear processes governed by mTOR have not been clearly defined. Using isobaric peptide tagging coupled with linear ion trap mass spectrometry, we performed quantitative proteomics analysis to identify nuclear processes in human cells under control of mTOR. Within 3 h of inhibiting mTOR with rapamycin in HeLa cells, we observed down-regulation of nuclear abundance of many proteins involved in translation and RNA modification. Unexpectedly, mTOR inhibition also down-regulated several proteins functioning in chromosomal integrity and up-regulated those involved in DNA damage responses (DDRs) such as 53BP1. Consistent with these proteomic changes and DDR activation, mTOR inhibition enhanced interaction between 53BP1 and p53 and increased phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase substrates. ATM substrate phosphorylation was also induced by inhibiting protein synthesis and suppressed by inhibiting proteasomal activity, suggesting that mTOR inhibition reduces steady-state (abundance) levels of proteins that function in cellular pathways of DDR activation. Finally, rapamycin-induced changes led to increased survival after radiation exposure in HeLa cells. These findings reveal a novel functional link between mTOR and DDR pathways in the nucleus potentially operating as a survival mechanism against unfavorable growth conditions.

The role of 15-LOX-1 in colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer. Chronic inflammation is known to be mechanistically linked to the development of cancer. This article reviews and discusses the role of 15-lipoxygenase-1 (15-LOX-1) in the resolution of colitis and prevention of colitis-associated colorectal cancer. 15-LOX-1 is an inducible and highly regulated enzyme in cells that play an important role in the production of lipid signaling mediators from linoleic acid and arachidonic acid. Together, these acids and 15-LOX-1 are the driving force for the resolution of acute and chronic inflammation in normal cells. Widespread inflammation can progress from local inflammation to ulcerative colitis, tumorigenesis, and finally invasive, metastatic, or benign colon cancer. Thus, reversing inflammation will halt the proliferation of cancerous cells. Decreased expression of 15-LOX-1 may lead to the development of colitis-associated colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer. n-3 Polyunsaturated fatty acids are potent anti-inflammatory and pro-resolution products of 15-LOX-1 that can potentially prevent colitis-associated colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer.

Effects of prophylaxis with iodised salt in an area of endemic goitre in north-eastern Sicily. In developed countries, the use of iodised salt represents the best prophylaxis of endemic goitre in areas exposed to iodine deficiency. In the present study we re-evaluated goitre prevalence and iodine intake 10 years after the introduction of iodised salt in an area of goitre endemia in north-eastern Sicily (Italy), and we compared these results with those obtained in previous surveys. Three centres with known moderate goitre endemia (Bronte, Nicosia, and Gagliano) and three other smaller ones with severe goitre endemia (Sperlinga, Villadoro, and Maniace) were studied. We surveyed 697 schoolchildren. Goitre prevalence was assessed by thyroid palpation and by a thyroid ultrasound scan. Iodine urinary excretion was also measured. Iodised salt consumption was 44% of total salt consumption. Goitre prevalence assessed by thyroid palpation was significantly decreased in all towns studied compared to previous surveys. However, the persistence of a mild goitre endemia was observed in some small rural centres (5.8% in Sperlinga/Villadoro, and 11.4% in Maniace). Goitre prevalence evaluated by thyroid ultrasound scan was greater than 5% in all centres of the endemic area and was always greater than that assessed by thyroid palpation. Iodine urinary excretion was above 100 microg/l in all localities studied. In conclusion, our studies indicate a progressive reduction in goitre prevalence over a period of about 30 years in schoolchildren in a well-characterised endemic area in northeastern Sicily. The decrease in goitre prevalence was associated with a significant increase in urinary iodine excretion. However, it may be speculated that iodine deficiency is the pre-eminent, but not the exclusive cause of goitre endemia in this area.

An extremely late complication of a Roux-en-Y jejuno-ileal bypass. We report the case of a patient who underwent an open Roux-en-Y jejuno-ileal bypass for morbid obesity in February 1976. Having enjoyed a normal and stable body mass index for 30Â years, she presented acutely with an intussusception of the blind limb.

[Influence of age on quality of life of patients with intestinal stoma]. The work presents the research data on quality of life of 63 patients with temporary intestinal stoma. The basic group was made of 35 patients aged 60+ years, 38 patients younger than 60 years were included in the control group. Researches were carried out by means of a scale of an estimation of quality of life MOS-SF-36 in 3 and 6 months after the colostomy. In 3 months after colostomy, the indicators estimating physical well-being were above in the control group, the indicators estimating mental well-being were comparable. In 6 months the positive dynamics of indicators of physical health was marked in the group of 60+ patients but it was less than in the control group. Indicators of mental health in elderly patients did not vary considerably in this period, unlike the indicators of younger patients where authentic improvement was marked. The conclusion is drawn that age is the independent factor influencing quality of life of stomas patients, thus quality of life suffered more in older patients.

Low level laser therapy does not modulate the outcomes of a highly bioactive glass-ceramic (Biosilicate) on bone consolidation in rats. The main purpose of the present work was to evaluate if low level laser therapy (LLLT) can improve the effects of novel fully-crystallized glass-ceramic (Biosilicate) on bone consolidation in tibial defects of rats. Forty male Wistar rats with tibial bone defects were used. Animals were divided into four groups: group bone defect control (CG); group bone defect filled with Biosilicate (BG); group bone defect filled with Biosilicate, irradiated with LLLT, at 60 J cm(-2) (BG 60) and group bone defect filled with Biosilicate, irradiated with LLLT, at 120 J cm(-2) (BG 120). A low-energy GaAlAs 830 nm, CW, 0.6 mm beam diameter, 100 W cm(-2), 60 and 120 J cm(-2) was used in this study. Laser irradiation was initiated immediately after the surgery procedure and it was performed every 48 h for 14 days. Fourteen days post-surgery, the three-point bending test revealed that the structural stiffness of the groups CG and BG was higher than the values of the groups BG60 and BG120. Morphometric analysis revealed no differences between the control group and the Biosilcate group. Interestingly, the groups treated with Biosilicate and laser (BG 60 and BG120) showed statistically significant lower values of newly formed bone in the area of the defect when compared to negative control (CG) and bone defect group filled with Biosilicate (CB). Our findings suggest that although Biosilicate exerts some osteogenic activity during bone repair, laser therapy is not able to modulate this process.

Survival and failure pattern of patients with endometrial cancer after extensive surgery including systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. We investigated the survival and the failure pattern of 288 patients with endometrial cancer treated with extensive surgery including systematic pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy followed by cisplatin-based chemotherapy from 1982 to 2002. We correlated the failure pattern with various clinicopathologic factors to find the predictors of recurrence sites. The 5-year overall survival rates were 97.5% for stage I, 87.5% for stage II, 85.2% for stage III, and 12.5% for stage IV. Notably, the 5-year survival rate was 76.5% for patients with stage IIIC disease. Among patients with a low risk (n = 92) for recurrence who received no adjuvant chemotherapy, 2 (2.2%) showed recurrent disease. Among those with intermediate (n = 98) and high (n = 98) risks for recurrence who received adjuvant chemotherapy, 9 (9.2%) and 20 (20.4%) showed recurrent disease, respectively. The recurrence sites were described as follows: distant (n = 12), vaginal (n = 8), peritoneal (n = 7), pelvic (n = 2), and lymphatic (n = 2). Lymphatic failure was found beyond the area of lymphadenectomy. Architectural and nuclear grades; myometrial, lymph-vascular space, and cervical invasions; and lymph node metastasis were predictors of distant failure. Cervical invasion and lymph node metastasis were predictors of vaginal failure. For patients with stage I/II cancer, the architectural and nuclear grades were related to distant failure. Seven (63.6%) of 11 patients with a low or intermediate risk survived after relapse, whereas only 1 (4.8%) of 21 patients with a high risk survived after a recurrence. We conclude that we need to further test the efficacy of systemic adjuvant therapy using new chemotherapeutic regimens to prevent distant failure and to improve the survival of patients with endometrial cancer.

In vitro and in vivo characterization of glycoprotein C-deleted infectious laryngotracheitis virus. Infectious laryngotracheitis is an important respiratory disease of chickens that is caused by an alphaherpesvirus [infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV); Gallid herpesvirus 1]. As herpesvirus envelope glycoproteins are main targets of the humoral host immune response, they are of particular interest for development of vaccines, as well as of diagnostic tools. The conserved, N-glycosylated envelope protein gC has been identified as a major surface antigen of ILTV. To study the function of gC, we now isolated a gC-deleted ILTV recombinant as well as a gC rescuant after co-transfection of permissive chicken cells with virion DNA and transfer plasmids containing engineered subgenomic fragments. Like other alphaherpesvirus homologues, ILTV gC proved to be non-essential for replication. ILTV-DeltagC exhibited delayed penetration kinetics and slightly reduced plaque sizes in cultured chicken cells, whereas virus titres were not reduced significantly compared with wild-type or gC-rescued virus. In vivo studies revealed that ILTV-DeltagC is attenuated in chickens. However, infection with high doses of ILTV-DeltagC was still fatal for approximately 20 % of the animals, whereas wild-type or gC-rescued ILTV led to 50 % mortality. Interestingly, innate and specific immune responses against ILTV-DeltagC were not reduced but enhanced, and surviving chickens were protected completely against challenge infection. Furthermore, ILTV-DeltagC might serve as a basis for marker vaccines permitting differentiation between vaccinated and field-virus-infected animals, as gC-specific antibodies could be detected easily in sera of animals infected with wild-type ILTV.

Learning to use a brain-machine interface: model, simulation and analysis. This paper presents a model of the learning process occurring during operation of a closed-loop brain-machine interface. The model consists of a population of simulated cortical neurons, a decoder that transforms neural activity into motor output, a feedback controller whose role is to reduce the error based on an error-descent algorithm, and an open-loop controller whose parameters are updated based on the corrections made by the feedback controller. We present evidence of the convergence of the internal model to the decoder's inverse model and use global sensitivity analysis to study the convergence's dependence on the parameters of the overall learning model. This model can be used as a simulation tool that predicts the outcome of closed-loop BMI experiments.

Absence of ERRalpha in female mice confers resistance to bone loss induced by age or estrogen-deficiency. ERRalpha is an orphan member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, which acts as a transcription factor and is involved in various metabolic processes. ERRalpha is also highly expressed in ossification zones during mouse development as well as in human bones and cell lines. Previous data have shown that this receptor up-modulates the expression of osteopontin, which acts as an inhibitor of bone mineralization and whose absence results in resistance to ovariectomy-induced bone loss. Altogether this suggests that ERRalpha may negatively regulate bone mass and could impact on bone fragility that occurs in the absence of estrogens. In this report, we have determined the in vivo effect of ERRalpha on bone, using knock-out mice. Relative to wild type animals, female ERRalphaKO bones do not age and are resistant to bone loss induced by estrogen-withdrawal. Strikingly male ERRalphaKO mice are indistinguishable from their wild type counterparts, both at the unchallenged or gonadectomized state. Using primary cell cultures originating from ERRalphaKO bone marrow, we also show that ERRalpha acts as an inhibitor of osteoblast differentiation. Down-regulating ERRalpha could thus be beneficial against osteoporosis.

Estimates of mammography coverage according to health surveys in Brazil. Population surveys constitute an essential tool to monitor mammography coverage and factors associated with its performance. Estimates tend to be overestimated in surveys based on the population living in households with a telephone. The study aimed to estimate mammography coverage from population-based surveys. Based on mammography coverage levels in women aged between 50 and 69 years, with and without a fixed telephone line, from the Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de DomicÃ­lios 2003 (PNAD--2003 National Household Survey), ratios between these coverage levels and their respective variation coefficient were calculated. The coverage ratio was multiplied by the coverage estimated by the VigilÃ¢ncia de Fatores de Risco e ProteÃ§Ã£o para DoenÃ§as CrÃ´nicas por InquÃ©rito TelefÃ´nico (VIGITEL--Telephone-based Surveillance of Risk and Protective Factors for Chronic Diseases), enabling coverage in women without telephones in 2007 to be estimated. These estimates were applied to the female population, with and without a telephone, obtained from the PNAD 2006, thus achieving the final estimates for the capitals. In 2007, mammography coverage was estimated at about 70% for the group of capitals, varying from 41.2% in Porto Velho (Northern Brazil) to 82.2% in FlorianÃ³polis (Southern Brazil). In 17 cities, coverage was higher than 60%; in eight, between 50% and 60%; and in two, below 50%. In absolute terms, the difference between VIGITEL coverage levels and those estimated was 6.5%, varying from 3.4% in SÃ£o Paulo (Southeastern Brazil) to 24.2% in JoÃ£o Pessoa (Northeastern Brazil). Differences in magnitudes of mammography coverage estimates for population surveys are mostly a reflection of study designs. In the specific case of mammography, it would be more appropriate to estimate its coverage by combining VIGITEL data with those from other surveys that include information about women with and without a fixed telephone line, especially in cities with low fixed telephone line coverage.

Comparative deacetylase activity of wild type and mutants of SIRT1. SIRT1, human ortholog of yeast SIR2 protein, deacetylates histones and several other transcription factors. Recently, SIRT1 has emerged as a drug target for treating age related diseases, type II diabetes, neurodegeneration, inflammation and cancer. Here, we have optimized production of functionally active wild type full-length SIRT1 protein and its N-terminal deleted mutants. In a comparative study, we found that the region containing 192-208 amino acids towards the N-terminus is critical for right conformational folding of the protein to retain its deacetylase activity. The EC(50) and IC(50) values obtained with standard modulators showed that the SRT(748) & SRT(556) can deacetylate substrate and are activated by resveratrol, whereas, deacetylase activity of all the other deletion mutants (SRT(540), SRT(532), SRT(507) and SRT(503)) was lost. We further report that the peptide substrate K(m) for SRT(748) (70+/-5.2 microM) was comparable to SRT(556) (93+/-5.4 microM). The K(m) for NAD(+) substrate was 176 & 274 microM for SRT(748) and SRT(556), respectively. Similar substrate affinity studies demonstrate that either of the protein (SRT(748) or SRT(556)) can be utilized for screening SIRT1 modulators. We have also examined critical regions in SIRT1 required for deacetylase activity as well as kinetic analyses of SIRT1 proteins.

[Anthropological analysis of interactions between health care providers and children in some paediatrics services in Western Africa (Abidjan, Bamako, Conakry)]. Africa represents a major part of infant global mortality. But if the medical causes of these deaths are well-known, the quality of the medical care provided to the children and the way it affects them are not really studied. Our study conducted in three countries of western Africa describes how much the care given to children involves a part of violence and emphasizes how the social status and the children educational popular modes influence the quality of care. The article underlines how the improvement of the quality of care in pediatrics services cannot be limited to a simple improvement of techniques but must also include all these socio-emotional aspects which constitute the foundations of real ethics.

Drug-induced proarrhythmia: risk factors and electrophysiological mechanisms. Drug-induced ventricular tachyarrhythmias can be caused by cardiovascular drugs, noncardiovascular drugs, and even nonprescription agents. They can result in arrhythmic emergencies and sudden cardiac death. If a new arrhythmia or aggravation of an existing arrhythmia develops during therapy with a drug at a concentration usually considered not to be toxic, the situation can be defined as proarrhythmia. Various cardiovascular and noncardiovascular drugs can increase the occurrence of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia of the 'torsade de pointes' type. Antiarrhythmic drugs, antimicrobial agents, and antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs are the most important groups. Age, female sex, and structural heart disease are important risk factors for the occurrence of torsade de pointes. Genetic predisposition and individual pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic sensitivity also have important roles in the generation of arrhythmias. An increase in spatial or temporal dispersion of repolarization and a triangular action-potential configuration have been identified as crucial predictors of proarrhythmia in experimental models. These studies emphasized that sole consideration of the QT interval is not sufficient to assess the proarrhythmic risk. In this Review, we focus on important triggers of proarrhythmia and the underlying electrophysiological mechanisms that can enhance or prevent the development of torsade de pointes. 


Mating changes the subcellular distribution and the functionality of estrogen receptors in the rat oviduct.

The expression of serum steroid sex hormones and steroidogenic enzymes following intraperitoneal administration of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in male rats. The adrenals of humans and primates could secrete large amounts of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulphate ester (DHEA-S) in the circulation, which act as precursors of active steroid hormones in a long series of peripheral target intracrine tissues. The marked decline of serum DHEA and DHEA-S concentrations with age in humans has been incriminated in the development of various pathologies. Therefore, this study aims to provide detailed information on the effects of the intraperitoneal injection of DHEA on circulating steroid hormones and their metabolites and their trade-off relationship over 24 h in male rats. In this study, 100 healthy adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups: control, 25 mg kg(-1) DHEA-treated and 100 mg kg(-1) DHEA-treated. The animals were sacrificed at 0, 1.5, 3, 6, 12 or 24 h, and the samples were collected for subsequent analysis. Total cholesterol (TC) markedly decreased 3h after the administration of 100 mg kg(-1) DHEA, but markedly increased 12h after administration. The DHEA-S, progesterone (P), testosterone (T), oestradiol (E(2)), cortisol (Cor) and aldosterone (Ald) concentrations also markedly increased after DHEA administration, with serum DHEA-S, T, E(2) and Cor levels peaking at 1.5 h. Over time, steroid hormone levels were depressed, but serum Cor and Ald levels were markedly elevated relative to the control group at 24 h. Furthermore, DHEA treatment produced a significant increase in P450scc, 17beta-HSDIII, CYP17alpha and 3beta-HSD mRNA expression at 1.5 h, but a decided decrease in P450scc and StAR mRNA expression at 12 and 24 h, and CYP17alpha and 17beta-HSDIII expression at 12 h in the 100 mg kg(-1) DHEA group. In total, the results of the present study indicate that DHEA at high pharmacological doses may affect steroid through an effect on steroidogenic enzymes.


Decelerated vascularization in tissue-engineered constructs in association with diabetes mellitus in vivo.

YAP-dependent induction of amphiregulin identifies a non-cell-autonomous component of the Hippo pathway. The Hippo signalling pathway regulates cellular proliferation and survival, thus has profound effects on normal cell fate and tumorigenesis. The pivotal effector of this pathway is YAP (yes-associated protein), a transcriptional co-activator amplified in mouse and human cancers, where it promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and malignant transformation. So far, studies of YAP target genes have focused on cell-autonomous mediators; here we show that YAP-expressing MCF10A breast epithelial cells enhance the proliferation of neighbouring untransfected cells, implicating a non-cell-autonomous mechanism. We identify the gene for the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand amphiregulin (AREG) as a transcriptional target of YAP, whose induction contributes to YAP-mediated cell proliferation and migration, but not EMT. Knockdown of AREG or addition of an EGFR kinase inhibitor abrogates the proliferative effects of YAP expression. Suppression of the negative YAP regulators LATS1 and 2 (large tumour suppressor 1 and 2) is sufficient to induce AREG expression, consistent with physiological regulation of AREG by the Hippo pathway. Genetic interaction between the Drosophila YAP orthologue Yorkie and Egfr signalling components supports the link between these two highly conserved signalling pathways. Thus, YAP-dependent secretion of AREG indicates that activation of EGFR signalling is an important non-cell-autonomous effector of the Hippo pathway, which has implications for the regulation of both physiological and malignant cell proliferation.


[Role of the PAP smear in adolescence].

Primary yolk sac tumor within the lateral ventricle. A 13-year-old girl presented with an exceedingly rare case of primary yolk sac tumor located within the lateral ventricle, manifesting as headache, nausea, and diplopia. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 4-cm-diameter solid enhanced mass within the left inferior horn of the lateral ventricle. The tumor was removed subtotally via left middle temporal corticotomy. The histological and immunohistochemical diagnosis was pure yolk sac tumor. The serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated at 1957.2 ng/ml and the serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin level was 4 mIU/ml after surgery. The patient underwent radiotherapy (whole brain, 30 Gy; tumor bed, 21 Gy; whole spinal axis, 30 Gy) and chemotherapy (ifosfamide, cisplatin, etoposide). After three treatment cycles, the serum AFP level had decreased to 4.5 ng/ml. However, the tumor recurred with cerebrospinal fluid dissemination after nine cycles of chemotherapy. She died 18 months after surgery. The possibility of germ cell tumor should be considered in pediatric patients with brain tumors occurring outside the pineal or suprasellar region.

Isolation and culture of ventral mesencephalic precursor cells and dopaminergic neurons from rodent brains. The ability to isolate ventral midbrain (VM) precursor cells and neurons provides a powerful means to characterize their differentiation properties and to study their potential for restoring dopamine (DA) neurons degenerated in Parkinson's disease (PD). Preparation and maintenance of DA VM in primary culture involves a number of critical steps to yield healthy cells and appropriate data. Here, we offer a detailed description of protocols to consistently prepare VM DA cultures from rat and mouse embryonic fetal-stage midbrain. We also present methods for organotypic culture of midbrain tissue, for differentiation as aggregate cultures, and for adherent culture systems of DA differentiation and maturation, followed by a synopsis of relevant analytical read-out options. Isolation and culture of rodent VM precursor cells and DA neurons can be exploited for studies of DA lineage development, of neuroprotection, and of cell therapeutic approaches in animal models of PD.

Transient receptor potential channel A1 and noxious cold responses in rat cutaneous nociceptors. The role of transient receptor potential channel A1 (TRPA1) in noxious cold sensation remains unclear. Some data support the hypothesis that TRPA1 is a transducer of noxious cold whilst other data contest it. In this study we investigated the role of TRPA1 in cold detection in cutaneous nociceptors in vivo using complementary experimental approaches. We used noxious withdrawal reflex electromyography, and single fibre recordings in vivo, to test the hypothesis that TRPA1-expressing primary afferents mediate noxious cold responses in anaesthetised rats. TRPV1 and TRPM8 agonists sensitise their cognate receptors to heat and cold stimuli respectively. Herein we show that the TRPA1 agonist cinnamaldehyde applied to the skin in anaesthetised rats did not sensitise noxious cold evoked hind limb withdrawal. In contrast, cinnamaldehyde did sensitise the C fibre-mediated noxious heat withdrawal, indicated by a significant drop in the withdrawal temperature. TRPA1 agonist thus sensitised the noxious reflex withdrawal to heat, but not cold. Thermal stimuli also sensitise transient receptor potential (TRP) channels to agonist. Activity evoked by capsaicin in teased primary afferent fibres showed a significant positive correlation with receptive field temperature, in both normal and Freund's complete adjuvant-induced cutaneous inflammation. Altering the temperature of the receptive field did not modulate TRPA1 agonist evoked-activity in cutaneous primary afferents, in either normal or inflamed skin. In addition, block of the TRPA1 channel with Ruthenium Red did not inhibit cold evoked activity in either cinnamaldehyde sensitive or insensitive cold responsive nociceptors. In cinnamaldehyde-sensitive-cold-sensitive afferents, although TRPA1 agonist-evoked activity was totally abolished by Ruthenium Red, cold evoked activity was unaffected by channel blockade. We conclude that these results do not support the hypothesis that TRPA1-expressing cutaneous afferents play an important role in noxious cold responses.

Multiple lentigines confined to a resolving psoriatic plaque. Development of nevus spilus-like lentigines in zones previously affected by plaques of psoriasis has been described. Most cases have appeared following phototherapy; then it has been suggested that the mechanism involved could be an abnormal reaction to UV light. However, cases of multiple lentigines arising within resolving psoriatic in patients who had not received phototherapy or photochemotherapy have been described as a result of possible post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. We report the case of patient who developed nevus spilus-like lentigines following therapy with topical calcipotriol on psoriatic plaques. We consider that the mechanism of production of lentigines is an unusual form of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.

Evaluating the Impact of Information Technology Tools to Support the Asthma Medical Home. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of information technology tools on the outcomes of children with asthma in the medical home. A registry was established for children aged 4 to 18 years with an ICD-9 code for asthma. Changes to the electronic health record included modifications to notes, care plans, and orders. A retrospective analysis of emergency department and in-patient utilization for a cohort of patients was conducted from July 2009 through June 2013. Of the study population (n = 1217), 65% had a classification of asthma severity and 63% were risk-stratified. Seventy percent had a control assessment at least once. Care plan use increased from 5% to 22% and enrollment in care coordination increased from 0.1% to 4%. After 3 years, there was a reduction of emergency department and inpatient admissions for asthma (P < .05 and P < .005, respectively). The implementation of information technology tools was associated with improved asthma outcomes.

The Rapid Cognitive Screen (RCS): A Point-of-Care Screening for Dementia and Mild Cognitive Impairment.

[Differences between cold and hot natures of processed Radix ginseng rubra and Panax quinquefolius L. based upon mice temperature tropism]. To establish an objective method to estimate the disparity between the cold and hot natures on the basis of an intrinsic correlation between temperature tropism of mice and the cold and hot natures of Chinese medicines. Male KM mice were randomly divided into 7 groups of 6 each, namely the normal group (NM), the weak model group (WM), the strong model group (SM), the weak model plus Radix ginseng rubra group (WM + RG), the weak model plus Panax quinquefolius L. group (WM + PQ), the strong model plus Radix ginseng rubra group (SM + RG) and the strong model plus Panax quinquefolius L. group (SM +PQ). The specific herbal drugs were administered intragastricly. To induce the weak model, mice were fed with a limited supply of feed and forced to swim in cold water until almost drowning while the strong model induced by feeding a high-protein diet with an unlimited feed access. The doses of Radix ginseng rubra and Panax quinquefolius L. were 35 mg/g of body weight per day (counted by the quantity of crude material) and lasting for seven days. The NM and model groups without dosing were intragastricly administered with physiological saline of the same volume to the dosing groups. The percentage of the remaining time of mouse on a high temperature (40 degrees C) pad to the total monitoring time was recorded by a self-designed intelligent animal behavior monitoring system. Meanwhile, the drinking volume of mice in each group was measured. Immediately after experiment, the activities of Na(+)K(+)-ATPase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in liver tissue were measured by assay kits of phosphorus and xanthine oxidase methods respectively. The features of deficient and cold symptom, such as fatigue, stagnant weight growth, decreased water intake, cold limbs and tail etc, were observed in WM group. And the features of heat symptom, such as increased weight and water intake, hyperactivity etc, were observed in SM group. The percentage of time that the mouse remained on 40 degrees C pad of the WM group within the seven days experiment was significantly higher than that of the normal group (70.6% +/- 21.3% vs 52.1% +/- 6.5%, P < 0.05). While the value of SM group (45.7% +/- 4.6% ) was significantly lower than that of the normal group (P < 0.05); the value of WM + RG group and WM + PQ group were 65.6% +/- 7.8% and 75.3% +/- 13.0% respectively (both P < 0.05 compared with WM group); the values of SM + RG group and SM + PQ group were 36.1% +/- 15.5% and 55.5% +/- 7.7% respectively (both P < 0.05 compared with SM group). The activities of Na(+)K(+)-ATPase and SOD of WM mice treated with either Radix ginseng rubra or Panax quinquefolius L. were found to have a significant up-regulation (P < 0.05) as compared with untreated WM mice. But only the Panax quinquefolius L. showed an up-regulating effect upon Na(+)K(+) ATPase and SOD in SM mice. The external cold and hot natures of Radix ginseng rubra and Panax quinquefolius L. can be represented in an ethological way by the changes of animal's temperature tropism. And such a tropism may be internally regulated by body's energy metabolism.


Admission criteria and prognostication in patients with cancer admitted to the intensive care unit.

Regulatory B cells shape the development of Th2 immune responses in BALB/c mice infected with Leishmania major through IL-10 production. Recent evidence indicates that B cells are required for susceptibility to infection with Leishmania major in BALB/c mice. In this study, we analyzed the role of the IL-10 produced by B cells in this process. We showed that B cells purified from the spleen of BALB/c mice produced IL-10 in response to stimulation with L. major in vitro. In vivo, early IL-10 mRNA expression is detected after L. major infection in B cells from draining lymph nodes of susceptible BALB/c, but not of resistant C57BL/6 mice. Although adoptive transfer of naive wild-type B cells prior to infection in B cell-deficient BALB/c mice restored Th2 cell development and susceptibility to infection with L. major of these otherwise resistant mice, adoptive transfer of IL-10(-/-) B cells mice did not. B cells stimulated by L. major, following in vitro or in vivo encounter, express the CD1d and CD5 molecules and the IL-10 produced by these cells downregulate IL-12 production by L. major-stimulated dendritic cells. These observations indicate that IL-10 secreting B cells are phenotypically and functionally regulatory B cells. Altogether these results demonstrate that the IL-10 produced by regulatory CD1d+ CD5+ B cells in response to L. major is critical for Th2 cell development in BALB/c mice.

The effect of beta-alanine supplementation on power performance during repeated sprint activity. The dipeptide carnosine has been shown to contribute to the buffer capacity of hydrogen ions (H) during intense exercise. Increasing skeletal muscle carnosine levels through beta-alanine (BA) supplementation has been shown to maintain acid-base balance, delay fatigue, and improve exercise performance. We designed this study to examine the effect of 5 weeks of BA supplementation on repeat high-intensity sprint performance. Nineteen, physically active, college men were divided into 2 groups (control [C], n = 10 or BA, n = 9). We performed double-blind placebo-controlled study where subjects ingested 4 g per day during the first week and 6 g per day over the next 4 weeks of a placebo (rice flour) or a BA supplement. Subjects completed 2 sets of 5 5-second sprints with 45-second recovery separated by 2 minutes of active recovery. All tests were conducted on a non-motorized treadmill against a resistance of 15% of the participant's body weight. We recorded horizontal power (HP) of the running sprint. Post-exercise capillary blood samples were analyzed for lactate to determine the metabolic demands. There were no significant between-group differences (p > 0.05) in HPpeak or HPmean for the repeat sprint protocol. No significant between-group differences were found for performance decrement (% fatigue) for HPpeak or HPmean. In addition, no significant interactions were observed. Post-exercise blood lactate values were similar pre and post supplementation in both groups. The results of this study clearly indicate that 5 weeks of BA supplementation provides no benefit for repeat sprint performance.

Influence of birthplace on breast cancer diagnosis and treatment for Hispanic women. Research has shown that Hispanic women in the United States are diagnosed with breast cancer at more advanced stages and initiate treatment later than non-Hispanic white women. We investigated whether stage at breast cancer diagnosis and receipt of primary therapy differ by ethnicity and birthplace among US-born Hispanic, foreign-born Hispanic, and white women. We studied 31,012 Hispanic women and 372,313 white women with a first diagnosis of invasive breast cancer during 1988 and 2005 living in a SEER area. We used multinomial logistic regression to assess the association of ethnicity and birthplace with stage at diagnosis and, among women with stage I or II cancers, primary therapy [mastectomy, breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with radiation, BCS without radiation], adjusting for other patient and tumor characteristics. Rates of stage at diagnosis differed significantly by race/ethnicity and birthplace (P < 0.001). Foreign-born Hispanics had lower adjusted rates of stage I breast cancer at diagnosis (35.4%) than US-born Hispanics (40.6%), birthplace-unknown Hispanics (42.3%), and whites (47.4%). Receipt of primary therapy also differed significantly by race/ethnicity and birthplace (P < 0.001). Foreign-born Hispanics and birthplace-unknown Hispanics had lower rates of BCS with radiation (34.9%, 30.7%) than US-born Hispanics (41.5%) and whites (38.8%). Foreign-born Hispanic women in the United States have a lower probability of being diagnosed at earlier stages of breast cancer and, for women with early-stage disease, of receiving radiation following BCS compared to US-born Hispanics and whites. Identifying factors mediating these disparities may help in developing culturally and linguistically appropriate interventions and improving outcomes.

Molecular modeling of dissociative and non-dissociative chemisorption of nitrosamine on close-ended and open-ended pristine and Stone-Wales defective (5,5) armchair single-walled carbon nanotubes. The nitrosamine adsorbed on close-ended and open-ended pristine and Stone-Wales defective (5,5) armchair single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) was studied using the B3LYP/6-31G(d) method. Structure optimization of all possible adsorption configurations based on the combination of two nitrosamine (amino- and imino-) isomers and four types of nanotubes was carried out. The most stable configuration for the nitrosamine adsorbed on the (5,5) armchair SWCNTs was found to be dissociative chemisorption. The adsorption energies of the most stable structures of the adsorption complexes of close-ended and open-ended pristine SWCNTs with the imino isomer of nitrosamine were -127.15 and -137.14 kcal mol(-1), respectively.

[Retrospective cohort study on the rate of mother-to-child transmission among mothers infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 through blood transfusion]. To study the rate of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) on HIV-1. All local residents from 8 townships in a region were screened for mothers who had a history of only one blood transfusion and 63 were found HIV-1 positive. A further study on these HIV-1 positive mothers and their children was conducted with the emphasis on the date of receiving blood transfusion, date and type of nationality, history regarding breastfeeding and so on. Sera specimens from 84 children born from 63 HIV-1 positive mothers were screened, using ELISA for HIV-1 antibody, and positive specimens were confirmed by Western-blot. The rate of MTCT was 32.1% (27/84) for children with all risk factors related to MTCT. Another 36.8% (7/19) were related to factors on intrauterine, intrapartum and breastfeeding, 35.7% (5/14) to intrapartum and breastfeeding factors, 14.3% (2/14) to intrauterine and intrapartum factors, 37.9% (11/29) to breastfeeding factor alone. By group combination analysis, the MTCT rate was 36.9% (24/65) with breastfeeding, 11.8% (2/17) with artificial feeding, and the former was significantly higher than the latter. HIV-1 MTCT rate among mothers caused by a single blood transfusion varied with different risk factors. Breastfeeding played an important role in MTCT, appeared in our study.

Exercise intervention and cardiovascular risk factors in obese children. Comparison between obese youngsters taking part in a physical activity school-based programme with and without individualised diet counselling: the ACORDA project. To determine the effects of a school-based exercise intervention programme on cardiovascular risk factors, including body fat (BF), metabolic profile and physical activity (PA) in children with and without individualised dietary counselling approach (IDC and WIDC). Forty-six overweight children from 6-16 years old (25 girls, 54.3%; ageâ=â10.3âÂ±â2.8) of six schools took part in an 8-month interdisciplinary, school-based intervention programme. All children were engaged in PA classes, but only one group was exposed to individualised counselling. Blood pressure (BP), lipids and lipoproteins, accelerometer-based PA, percentage of body fat (%BF) and trunk fat (%TF) measures were taken before and after intervention. General Linear Model (Repeated Measures ANOVA) adjusted for age, maturation and height change was used to analyse the longitudinal effect of individualised counselling between two evaluations in each group. Favourable changes were observed for %BF, %TF, systolic BP and total cholesterol in the IDC group. Subjects WIDC only increased light and moderate-vigorous PA. In IDC, significant effects for time * group interactions were found for systolic BP, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, indicating that counselling might add favourable changes in these markers, beyond those explained by PA and growth. School-based interventions can contribute to counteracting obesity in youth, particularly when individualised dietary counselling is provided. Therefore, the link between schools and professional counselling should be strengthened to ensure consolidated changes towards healthy behaviours.

Effect of Polymer Micelles on Antifungal Activity of Geranylorcinol Compounds against Botrytis cinerea. Herein, we explore the potential use of two micelle-forming block copolymers, i.e., Pluronic F-127 and poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(caprolactone), for application of fungicide agents. The polymer effect on the in vitro fungicide activity of a series of geranyl orcinol derivatives against Botrytis cinerea has been assessed. The results show that, for all test compounds, the incorporation into micelles, formed by Pluronic F-127, produces a great enhancement of the inhibitory effect on the growth of B. cinerea. For some compounds, at the lowest tested concentration (50 ppm), the percentage of inhibition increases significantly (from 0-10 to 80-90%) when the application is made using a polymer solution instead of an ethanol/water mixture. The synthesis and structural determination of a series of eight geranylphenols/diacetates, which were used as fungicide agents, are also discussed. These results suggest that polymer micelles are promising systems for application of crop-protecting agents. 

A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial of oral selegiline hydrochloride for smoking cessation in nicotine-dependent cigarette smokers. The primary aim of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of the monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitor selegiline hydrochloride (SEL, l-Deprenyl; Eldepryl) as an aid for smoking cessation in cigarette smokers. One hundred and one nicotine-dependent adult cigarette smokers without current psychiatric or substance use disorders participated in this 8-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants received either SEL (5mg bid, n=51) or placebo (PLO, n=50), in combination with brief (<10 min) manualized smoking cessation counseling. The main smoking outcome measures were 7-day point prevalence abstinence at end of trial (EOT), 4-week continuous smoking abstinence at end of trial (CA), and 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 6-month follow-up (6MFU). Abstinence was determined by an absence of self-reported cigarette smoking and biochemically verified by expired breath carbon monoxide and plasma cotinine levels. Rates of smoking abstinence did not differ by medication group (EOT: SEL=16%, PLO=20%, p=0.57; CA: SEL=14%, PLO=18%, p=0.56; 6MFU: SEL=12%, PLO=16%, p=0.54). Adverse events were modest and comparable between medication groups. Participants receiving SEL were more likely than those receiving PLO to report dry mouth (25.5% versus 8.2%, p<0.05). Our results suggest that SEL was safe and well-tolerated by adult cigarette smokers, but did not improve smoking abstinence rates compared to PLO.

Psychological flexibility in adults with chronic pain: a study of acceptance, mindfulness, and values-based action in primary care.

Perioperative changes in PIVKA-II. Proteins induced by vitamin K absence for factor II (PIVKA-II) is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay that monitors uncarboxylated prothrombin and responds to vitamin K deficits prior to changes in the prothrombin test. The aim of this project was to study perioperative PIVKA-II changes during various types of surgery in a prospective observational study. Patients undergoing abdominal or orthopaedic surgery were included. Blood was sampled on the day of surgery (preoperatively) and up to 5 days after surgery. The activated partial thromboplastin time, Quick and Owren prothrombin times were analyzed, together with PIVKA-II. Thirty-nine patients were included, 27 +male and 12 +female. All but 7 +patients had elevated PIVKA-II levels preoperatively. PIVKA-II levels had already increased significantly (p < 0.017) on day 1 after surgery as compared to presurgery plasma levels. The median PIVKA-II was highest on day 5. Routine tests were mostly normal. No significant difference in PIVKA-II was seen when comparing patients undergoing abdominal versus orthopaedic surgeries. There was no significant correlation between PIVKA-II and routine coagulation tests. Patients with anterior resection, emergency laparotomy and emergency hip fractures had higher postoperative increases, which could be linked to increased gastrointestinal recovery times, paralytic ileus, peritonitis and comorbidities. PIVKA-II levels increase during the perioperative period, despite mostly normal routine coagulation tests. Pre- and perioperative vitamin K supplementation in patients with elevated PIVKA-II levels should be studied, and its clinical significance be defined in future studies.


Fibrinogen kinetics and protein turnover in obese non-diabetic males: effects of insulin.

Family-based association study of interleukin 6 (IL6) and its receptor (IL6R) functional polymorphisms in schizophrenia in the Polish population. Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disorder and its etiology remains incompletely elucidated. Among possible causes, immunological factors have been implicated in its pathogenesis and course. The inflammatory system may trigger or modulate the course of schizophrenia through complex mechanisms influencing neurodevelopment, neuroplasticity and neurotransmission. Recent studies indicate a role of excessive interleukin-6 (IL6) signaling in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Findings regarding changes in the circulating levels of soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL6R) in schizophrenia have been equivocal. The study was performed on a group of 147 trio (patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and their healthy parents). Polymorphisms of IL6 (rs1800795, rs1800797) and IL6R (rs4537545, rs4845617, rs2228145) genes were genotyped with the use of TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays. No association of the polymorphisms from IL6 and IL6R genes with schizophrenia was found. We also investigated haplotypes in IL6 gene (consisting of rs1800795 and rs1800797) and in IL6R gene (consisting of rs4537545, rs2228145). We also found no preference in transmission of any haplotype. Our results do not support the theory that polymorphisms of IL6 and IL6R genes are involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. It seems advisable to carry out further examinations of the role of these polymorphisms in schizophrenia by means of TDT method and classical (case-control) association method. 

Risk of Stroke-Associated Pneumonia With Acid-Suppressive Drugs: A Population-Based Cohort Study. Acid-suppressive drugs, including histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs) and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), are common medications used for treating upper gastrointestinal tract disorders. However, acid-suppressive drugs have been reported to increase the risk of pneumonia in numerous disease populations. However, the relationship between acid-suppressive drugs and stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between acid-suppressive drug usage and pneumonia among patients with stroke by using a nationwide data set. A population-based cohort study was conducted using a data set from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database. Data on patients with new-onset stroke from 2010 to 2011 were collected. Patients with and without acid-suppressive drug usage were followed up to identify the occurrence of any type of pneumonia. We estimated the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) by using the Cox proportional hazards model. The study cohort comprised 7965 patients with new-onset stroke. The incidence of pneumonia was 6.9% (552/7965) and more than 40% (225/552) of patients developed pneumonia within 3 months after an acute stroke. Acid-suppressive drug usage was an independent risk factor of pneumonia. The adjusted HR for the risk of pneumonia in patients with new-onset stroke using acid-suppressive drugs was 1.44 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.18-1.75, P < 0.01). Only PPI usage increased risk of chronic SAP (adjusted HR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.04-2.05). Acid-suppressive drug usage was associated with a slightly increased risk of SAP. Physicians should exercise caution when prescribing acid-suppressive drugs to patients with stroke, particularly at the chronic stage.

Achieving quality in health care through language access services: lessons from a California public hospital. Provision of language services is central to the delivery of equitable, safe, high-quality health care for patients with limited English proficiency. However, there are many barriers to ensuring access to such services. We analyzed the experience of a model language service program at a public hospital to develop recommendations applicable to all hospitals that wish to create an effective language service program. Our case study demonstrates that with organizational commitment, early information technology involvement, attention to clinical needs, active engagement of stakeholders, and coordinated project management, it is possible to provide high-quality language services in a setting of financial constraints.

Phosphodiesterase 3 inhibition reduces platelet activation and monocyte tissue factor expression in knee arthroplasty patients. Tissue damage during surgery activates platelets and provokes a prothrombic state. The current study attempted to determine the impact of phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors on platelet activation, platelet-leukocyte aggregate formation, and monocyte tissue factor expression during and after total knee arthroplasty. Thirty-four patients undergoing scheduled total knee arthroplasty were randomly assigned to receive either the phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor milrinone or the same amount of saline perioperatively. The effects of milrinone on platelet and leukocyte function in vitro were then assessed in healthy volunteers. Perioperative infusion of milrinone significantly attenuated platelet activation; phosphorylation of intraplatelet p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and Akt; and platelet-leukocyte aggregation. Furthermore, perioperative tissue factor expression on monocytes and fibrin monomer complex production were reduced by milrinone infusion in patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. In vitro studies using adenosine diphosphate- and collagen-stimulated blood samples from healthy volunteers confirmed the antiplatelet effects and reduced monocyte tissue factor expression by milrinone. These studies further showed that platelet aggregation and integrin alpha(IIb)beta(3) activation were modified by intraplatelet phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways, and that P-selectin expression on platelets and platelet-leukocyte aggregation were modulated by intraplatelet p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. Continuous milrinone infusion has the potential to reduce platelet activation and monocyte tissue factor expression during the perioperative period in total knee arthroplasty. These events may be mediated in part by the ability of milrinone to reduce activation of intraplatelet mitogen-activated protein kinases and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. The clinical impact of phosphodiesterase 3 inhibition on perioperative hemostasis remains to be elucidated.

How can neuroimaging help in the diagnosis of movement disorders? The main role of computed axial tomography in the field of movement disorders was to exclude uncommon but potentially reversible structural abnormalities including tumors, chronic subdural hematoma, and communicating hydrocephalus presenting with parkinsonism. In the past 20 years magnetic resonance has had greater impact in facilitating accurate diagnosis but its clinical usefulness is less than in some other neurologic fields. Dopamine transporter SPECT imaging is helpful in distinguishing benign tremulous Parkinson disease from atypical tremor syndromes and other clinical scenarios where the demonstration of nigrostriatal dopamine denervation is helpful. We use eight case vignettes to illustrate how MR imaging findings can assist in the diagnosis of movement disorders and, in some cases, change the course of patient management.


Understanding the lack of understanding: invalidation from the perspective of the patient with fibromyalgia.

Deployment of regulatory genes during gastrulation and germ layer specification in a model spiralian mollusc Crepidula. During gastrulation, endoderm and mesoderm are specified from a bipotential precursor (endomesoderm) that is argued to be homologous across bilaterians. Spiralians also generate mesoderm from ectodermal precursors (ectomesoderm), which arises near the blastopore. While a conserved gene regulatory network controls specification of endomesoderm in deuterostomes and ecdysozoans, little is known about genes controlling specification or behavior of either source of spiralian mesoderm or the digestive tract. Using the mollusc Crepidula, we examined conserved regulatory factors and compared their expression to fate maps to score expression in the germ layers, blastopore lip, and digestive tract. Many genes were expressed in both ecto- and endomesoderm, but only five were expressed in ectomesoderm exclusively. The latter may contribute to epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition seen in ectomesoderm. We present the first comparison of genes expressed during spiralian gastrulation in the context of high-resolution fate maps. We found variation of genes expressed in the blastopore lip, mouth, and cells that will form the anus. Shared expression of many genes in both mesodermal sources suggests that components of the conserved endomesoderm program were either co-opted for ectomesoderm formation or that ecto- and endomesoderm are derived from a common mesodermal precursor that became subdivided into distinct domains during evolution.

Characterization of MSCs from human placental decidua basalis in hypoxia and serum deprivation. Recently, we reported that human PDB (placental decidua basalis) is an excellent source of MSCs (mesenchymal stem cells), meanwhile, PDB-MSCs could survive under hypoxia and serum deprivation. Herein, we investigated the proliferation, clonogentic efficiency, phenotypes, metabolic activity and cytokines secretion of PDB-MSCs in hypoxia and serum deprivation. PDB-MSCs were cultured in four groups: normoxia (20% O2) and complete medium [10% FBS (foetal bovine serum)+DMEM-HG (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-high glucose)], hypoxia and complete medium, normoxia and serum deprivation (0% FBS), and hypoxia and serum deprivation. After 96 h of culture in the above groups, PDB-MSCs maintain the phenotypes stably. Interestingly, hypoxia notably enhanced the proliferation, colony-forming potential and lactate/glucose ratio in complete medium, but suppressed the secretion of BMP-2 (bone morphogenetic protein-2) and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor), while it did not change the quantity of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) and bFGF in serum deprivation. Although PDB-MSCs grew slowly and seldom formed a colony unit in hypoxia and serum deprivation, they possessed a moderate metabolism. In conclusion, our results indicate that PDB-MSCs appear to be promising seed cells for ischaemia-related tissue engineering.


Progress in Understanding Algal Bloom-Mediated Fish Kills: The Role of Superoxide Radicals, Phycotoxins and Fatty Acids.

Acaricidal properties of the essential oil from Hesperozygis ringens (Lamiaceae) on the cattle tick Riphicephalus (Boophilus) microplus. Hesperozygis ringens (Benth.) Epling (Lamiaceae) is a strongly aromatic plant employed popularly for its antiparasitic properties. The leaves afforded 4% of essential oil constituted mainly by pulegone (86%). Laboratory tests were carried out to determine the toxicity of the essential oil species on engorged females and larvae of the cattle tick Riphicephalus (Boophilus) microplus using the adult immersion test (AIT) and the larval immersion test (LIT). It was observed that the essential oil at the concentration of 50 microL/mL and 25 microL/mL inhibited the egg laying significatively in relation to the controls and the eggs from these treated females were affected by the oil; the hatching was inhibited in 95% and 30%, respectively. In the LIT it was verified that the LC(99.9), LC(50) and LC(1) was 0.541 microL/mL, 0.260 microL/mL and 0.015 microL/mL, respectively. Pulegone, isolated from the oil, showed similar effect on the females and on the larvae, indicating that it is responsible for the oil activity.


Phase I trial of 17-dimethylaminoethylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG), a heat shock protein inhibitor, administered twice weekly in patients with advanced malignancies.

A multi-level parcellation approach for brain functional connectivity analysis. Most brain functional connectivity methods in fMRI require a brain parcellation into functionally homogeneous regions. In this work we propose a novel parcellation approach based on a spatial hierarchical clustering, that provides clusters within a multi-level framework. The method has the advantage of producing several brain parcellations rather than a single one from a fixed size-homogeneity criterion. Results obtained on real data demonstrate the relevance of the approach. Finally, a connectivity study shows the benefit of a prior multi-level parcellation of the brain.


High expression of microRNA-15b predicts a low risk of tumor recurrence following curative resection of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Strategies to optimize HIV treatment outcomes in resource-limited settings. Although the availability of antiretroviral therapy has increased rapidly to reach over three million people in low- and middle-income countries, coverage remains low as only 31% of people in need were receiving antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa. Antiretroviral therapy scale-up needs to continue to grow exponentially to meet the need for universal access and keep pace with or exceed the new HIV infections. This calls for strategies that will have the greatest impact on the reduction of opportunistic infections, toxicities, and early mortality after antiretroviral therapy initiation as well improve adherence, clinical, immunological, and virologic responses, patient retention in antiretroviral therapy programs, and overall quality of life of people living with HIV/AIDS. Expanding antiretroviral therapy to all those eligible requires evidence-based decisions about how, when, and where expansion should occur. In this article we highlight some of the strategies that have optimized HIV treatment outcomes within the constraints of limited resources in sub-Saharan Africa. Key strategies to optimize HIV treatment outcomes include, i) scaling up HIV testing to identify all in need of HIV treatment, ii) strengthening the links between HIV diagnosis and comprehensive HIV/AIDS care, iii) timely initiation of antiretroviral therapy, iv) optimal diagnosis and treatment of opportunistic infections and comorbidities, v) investing in laboratory tests to support clinical monitoring of patients on antiretroviral therapy, vi) maximizing adherence to antiretroviral medication and retention of patients in HIV/AIDS care, viii) improving the health infrastructure, and increasing the human resources to handle the growing numbers of people in need of HIV treatment.


Depressive mood changes and psychiatric symptoms during 12-month low-dose interferon-alpha treatment in patients with malignant melanoma: results from the multicenter DeCOG trial.

Comparing cone-beam CT intensity correction methods for dose recalculation in adaptive intensity-modulated photon and proton therapy for head and neck cancer. Adaptive intensity-modulated photon and proton radiotherapy (IMRT and IMPT) of head and neck (H&N) cancer requires frequent three-dimensional (3D) dose calculation. We compared two approaches for dose recalculation on the basis of intensity-corrected cone-beam (CB) x-ray computed tomography (CT) images. For nine H&N tumor patients, virtual CTs (vCT) were generated by deformable image registration of the planning CT (pCT) to the CBCT. The second intensity correction approach used population-based lookup tables for scaling CBCT intensities to the pCT HU range (CBCTLUT). IMRT and IMPT plans were generated with a commercial treatment planning system. Dose recalculations on vCT and CBCTLUT were analyzed using a (3%, 3 mm) gamma-index analysis and comparison of normal tissue and tumor dose/volume parameters. A replanning CT (rpCT) acquired within three days of the CBCT served as reference. Single field uniform dose (SFUD) proton plans were created and recalculated on vCT and CBCTLUT for proton range comparison. Dose/volume parameters showed minor differences between rpCT, vCT and CBCTLUT in IMRT, but clinically relevant deviations between CBCTLUT and rpCT in the spinal cord for IMPT. Gamma-index pass-rates were found increased for vCT with respect to CBCTLUT in IMPT (by up to 21 percentage points) and IMRT (by up to 9 percentage points) for most cases. The SFUD-based proton range assessment showed improved agreement of vCT and rpCT, with 88-99% of the depth dose profiles in beam's eye view agreeing within 3 mm. For CBCTLUT, only 80-94% of the profiles fulfilled this criterion. vCT and CBCTLUT are suitable options for dose recalculation in adaptive IMRT. In the scope of IMPT, the vCT approach is preferable.

Acid sphingomyelinase, cell membranes and human disease: lessons from Niemann-Pick disease. Acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) plays an important role in normal membrane turnover through the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, and is one of the key enzymes responsible for the production of ceramide. ASM activity is deficient in the genetic disorder Types A and B Niemann-Pick disease (NPD). ASM knockout (ASMKO) mice were originally constructed to study this disorder, and numerous defects in ceramide-related signaling have been shown. Studies in these mice have further suggested that ASM may be involved in the pathogenesis of several common diseases through the reorganization of membrane microdomains. This review will focus on the role of ASM in membrane biology, with a specific emphasis on what a rare genetic disorder (NPD) has taught us about more common events.

The clinical investigator-subject relationship: a contextual approach. The nature of the relationship between a clinical investigator and a research subject has generated considerable debate because the investigator occupies two distinct roles: clinician and scientist. As a clinician, the investigator has duties to provide the patient with optimal care and undivided loyalty. As a scientist, the investigator has duties to follow the rules, procedures and methods described in the protocol. In this article, I present a contextual approach to the investigator-subject relationship. The extent of the investigator's duty to provide the patient/subject with clinical care can vary from one situation to the next, as a function of several factors, including: the research design, benefits and risks of the research; the subject's reasonable expectations, motivations, and vulnerabilities; the investigator's ability to benefit the subject; and the investigator's prior relationship with the subject. These and other factors need to be considered when determining the clinical investigator's obligations to provide clinical care to human research subjects. In some research contexts, the investigator has extensive clinical obligations to the patient/subject; in others, the investigator has minimal ones.

Environmental pollutants parathion, paraquat and bisphenol A show distinct effects towards nuclear receptors-mediated induction of xenobiotics-metabolizing cytochromes P450 in human hepatocytes. Environmental pollutants parathion, bisphenol A and paraquat were not systematically studied towards the effects on the expression of phase I xenobiotics-metabolizing cytochromes P450 (CYPs). We monitored their effects on the expression of selected CYPs in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. Moreover, we investigated their effects on the receptors regulating these CYPs, particularly arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR), pregnane X receptor (PXR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) by gene reporter assays. We found that parathion and bisphenol A are the activators of AhR. Moreover, they are the inducers of CYP1A1 mRNA in hepatoma cells HepG2 as well as in human hepatocytes by AhR-dependent mechanism via formation of AhR-DNA-binding complex, as revealed by gel shift assay. All three compounds possessed anti-glucocorticoid action as revealed by GR-dependent gene reporter assay and a decline in tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) gene expression in human hepatocytes. Moreover, parathion and bisphenol A are the activators of PXR and inducers of CYP3A4 mRNA and protein in the primary cultures of human hepatocytes. In conclusion, the studied compounds displayed distinct activities towards nuclear receptors involved in many biological processes and these findings may help us to better understand their adverse actions in pathological states followed after their exposure. 

Active Living Logan Square: joining together to create opportunities for physical activity. The Active Living Logan Square target audience is the community of the southwest corner of Logan Square, an urban Chicago community of 84,466 residents, mostly Latinos. Through the Active Living by Design (ALbD) initiative, the Logan Square Neighborhood Association leveraged its 48 years of existence in the neighborhood to create opportunities and build partnerships. Activities addressed three primary goals: (1) enhance school environments and practices to support physical activity before, during, and after the school day; (2) encourage individuals and families to enjoy outdoor activities in their own communities; and (3) create safe, inviting places for activity that connect to surrounding communities. The partnership's participatory approach involved a variety of community stakeholders in developing and implementing affordable, accessible, culturally acceptable, and sustainable physical activities for children and their families. The partnership successfully piloted Open Streets (temporary street closures) and advocated for development of the Bloomingdale Trail, an elevated rails-to-trails project. In schools, the partnership changed the culture at McAuliffe Elementary to support healthy behaviors through new policies, physical projects, and programs. Vital components of the project's success included a full-time coordinator with strong community ties; time to build healthy relationships within the partnership and community; the use of culturally relevant strategies; and flexibility to welcome complementary opportunities. The partnership intentionally did not produce a single community-recognized campaign; instead, it chose to use limited resources to promote tangible programs and projects that led to sustainable and replicable changes that promote physical activity.

[tMfn2 gene transfer promotes vascular smooth-muscle cells apoptosis via activation of the mitochondrial cell death pathway]. To investigate the effect of tMfn2 gene transfer on promoting the apoptosis of vascular smooth-muscle cells (VSMCs). VSMCs were infected by adenovirus-mediated tMfn2 (Adv-tMfn2) or adenovirus-mediated Mfn2 (Adv-Mfn2). FACS analysis, cell death ELISA and TUNEL staining were used to investigate the role of tMfn2 and Adv-Mfn2 gene transfer on VSMCs apoptosis. Western blot was used to analyze the protein expression of p-Akt, Bcl-2, Bax and cleaved caspase-9. FACS and ELISA results showed that tMfn2 was superior to Mfn2 in promoting VSMCs apoptosis and tMfn2 gene transfer induced VSMCs apoptosis in a time-dependent manner (P < 0.01). TUNEL staining evidenced that there were more positive-apoptotic VSMCs in tMfn2 group than that in Mfn2 group (P < 0.01). The protein expressions of phosphorylated Akt and Bcl-2 were significantly decreased, whereas Bax and cleaved caspase-9 protein expressions were significantly upregulated in tMfn2-transfected VSMCs. tMfn2 transfer promoted apoptosis of VSMCs in a time dependent manner via the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.

Bacillus amyloliquefaciens GA1 as a source of potent antibiotics and other secondary metabolites for biocontrol of plant pathogens. Phytopathogenic fungi affecting crop and post-harvested vegetables are a major threat to food production and food storage. To face these drawbacks, producers have become increasingly dependent on agrochemicals. However, intensive use of these compounds has led to the emergence of pathogen resistance and severe negative environmental impacts. There are also a number of plant diseases for which chemical solutions are ineffective or non-existent as well as an increasing demand by consumers for pesticide-free food. Thus, biological control through the use of natural antagonistic microorganisms has emerged as a promising alternative to chemical pesticides for more rational and safe crop management. The genome of the plant-associated B. amyloliquefaciens GA1 was sample sequenced. Several gene clusters involved in the synthesis of biocontrol agents were detected. Four gene clusters were shown to direct the synthesis of the cyclic lipopeptides surfactin, iturin A and fengycin as well as the iron-siderophore bacillibactin. Beside these non-ribosomaly synthetised peptides, three additional gene clusters directing the synthesis of the antibacterial polyketides macrolactin, bacillaene and difficidin were identified. Mass spectrometry analysis of culture supernatants led to the identification of these secondary metabolites, hence demonstrating that the corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters are functional in strain GA1. In addition, genes encoding enzymes involved in synthesis and export of the dipeptide antibiotic bacilysin were highlighted. However, only its chlorinated derivative, chlorotetaine, could be detected in culture supernatants. On the contrary, genes involved in ribosome-dependent synthesis of bacteriocin and other antibiotic peptides were not detected as compared to the reference strain B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42. The production of all of these antibiotic compounds highlights B. amyloliquefaciens GA1 as a good candidate for the development of biocontrol agents.

Entner-Doudoroff pathway for sulfoquinovose degradation in Pseudomonas putida SQ1. Sulfoquinovose (SQ; 6-deoxy-6-sulfoglucose) is the polar head group of the plant sulfolipid SQ-diacylglycerol, and SQ comprises a major proportion of the organosulfur in nature, where it is degraded by bacteria. A first degradation pathway for SQ has been demonstrated recently, a "sulfoglycolytic" pathway, in addition to the classical glycolytic (Embden-Meyerhof) pathway in Escherichia coli K-12; half of the carbon of SQ is abstracted as dihydroxyacetonephosphate (DHAP) and used for growth, whereas a C3-organosulfonate, 2,3-dihydroxypropane sulfonate (DHPS), is excreted. The environmental isolate Pseudomonas putida SQ1 is also able to use SQ for growth, and excretes a different C3-organosulfonate, 3-sulfolactate (SL). In this study, we revealed the catabolic pathway for SQ in P. putida SQ1 through differential proteomics and transcriptional analyses, by in vitro reconstitution of the complete pathway by five heterologously produced enzymes, and by identification of all four organosulfonate intermediates. The pathway follows a reaction sequence analogous to the Entner-Doudoroff pathway for glucose-6-phosphate: It involves an NAD(+)-dependent SQ dehydrogenase, 6-deoxy-6-sulfogluconolactone (SGL) lactonase, 6-deoxy-6-sulfogluconate (SG) dehydratase, and 2-keto-3,6-dideoxy-6-sulfogluconate (KDSG) aldolase. The aldolase reaction yields pyruvate, which supports growth of P. putida, and 3-sulfolactaldehyde (SLA), which is oxidized to SL by an NAD(P)(+)-dependent SLA dehydrogenase. All five enzymes are encoded in a single gene cluster that includes, for example, genes for transport and regulation. Homologous gene clusters were found in genomes of other P. putida strains, in other gamma-Proteobacteria, and in beta- and alpha-Proteobacteria, for example, in genomes of Enterobacteria, Vibrio, and Halomonas species, and in typical soil bacteria, such as Burkholderia, Herbaspirillum, and Rhizobium.

[A comparative study of the clinical effects between two kinds of negative-pressure wound therapy]. To compare the differences of the clinical effects, side effects and treatment-related cost between two kinds of negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT). Forty-four inpatients with acute, subacute, and chronic wounds were divided into simplified NPWT group (A group) and conventional NPWT group (B group) according to the random number table. Wounds of patients in A group were treated with gauze + continuous suction with hospital central negative pressure (-10.64 kPa) for 24 hs; wounds of patients in B group were treated with sponge + interrupted suction with a purpose-designed suction appliance (-16.63 kPa) for 24 hs. Gross wound condition, treatment time, survival rates of skin graft and flap, changes of bacterial species on wound, treatment cost, and ratio of side effects between two groups were compared. There was no significant difference between A and B groups in respect of gross wound condition, treatment time [A group (29 +/- 12) d, B group (26 +/- 13) d, P > 0.05], changes of bacterial species, survival rates of skin graft [A group (98 +/- 4)%, B group (98 +/- 4)%, P > 0.05] and flap (A group 98%, B group 100%, P > 0.05). Treatment cost of A group yen(374 +/- 134) was obviously lower than that of B group yen(9825 +/- 4956) (P < 0. 01), while more side effects were observed in A group (33.3%) than that in B group (5.0%) (P < 0.05). Both simplified NPWT and NPWT with purpose-designed appliance can effectively improve wound healing. The simplified method may cause many side effects and has a potential risk of inciting nosocomial infection, but it can be conveniently employed with a low cost. In contrast, the cost of using purpose-designed appliance should be cut down to meet the aim of generalization.

Malachite green adsorption onto natural zeolite and reuse by microwave irradiation. Natural zeolite was used for the removal of malachite green (MG) from aqueous solution in batch mode and reused by microwave irradiation. The isotherm data were analyzed by the Langmuir, Freundlich, Redlich-Peterson, and Koble-Corrigan isotherm model. The better fit for the equilibrium process was Koble-Corrigan model. The kinetic studies indicated that the adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic. Thermodynamic calculations showed that the adsorption was spontaneous and endothermic process. Spent zeolite was treated by microwave irradiation and it was found that yield of regeneration was 85.8% in the case of microwave irradiated time 10 min at 160 W.

Baicalin protects thymus of rats with severe acute pancreatitis. To study the protective role of Baicalin on rats thymus with severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). The SAP rats were randomly assigned to the model control, Baicalin treated and Octreotide treated groups. Normal rats were assigned to the sham-operated group. The rat survival rates, pathological changes of thymus, apoptotic indexes and expression levels of NF-kappaB, Bax, Bcl-2, Caspase-3 and P-selectin of all groups were observed and recorded at 3, 6 and 12 h after operation, respectively. Rat survival rates were significantly higher in both Baicalin- and Octreotide-treated groups than those in the model control group at 12 h (P < 0.05). The thymus pathological score was significantly lower in Baicalin treated group than in control group at 3 and 12 h (P < 0.05). The expression of NF-kappaB, Bax and Bcl-2 in thymus tissue was negative in all groups. At 3 h after operation, the staining intensity, positive staining rate and intensity of Caspase-3 protein in the thymuses of the Baicalin treated group were significantly higher than those in the model control group (P < 0.01). At different time points after operation, no marked difference was observed in the staining intensity of P-selectin protein between the Baicalin treated group and the model control group (P > 0.05). At 6 h after operation, the positive staining rate and intensity of P-selectin protein in the Baicalin treated group was significantly lower than those in the model control group (P < 0.05). The apoptotic indexes were significantly higher in treated group than in model control group at 6 h (P < 0.05). Baicalin has a protective role on the thymus of SAP rats, and its effect of decreasing inflammatory mediators level in blood, inhibiting P-selectin expression and inducing apoptosis of thymocytes may involve in the mechanism of its protective role.

[Prevalence of physical abuse in childhood and exposure to parental violence in a Brazilian sample]. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of physical abuse and exposure to parental violence during childhood, in relation to socio-demographic characteristics. Multi-stage sampling was used to select 3,007 individuals 14 years or older in 2005-2006, from all regions of the country. The study detected cases of physical abuse (beating, striking with objects, burning or scalding, threatening and/or using knives or firearms) and exposure to parental violence (witnessing parental threats and/or actual physical aggression) during childhood. Analyses were performed with the Pearson chi-square test. Prevalence of history of physical abuse in childhood was 44.1% (33.8% moderate, 10.3% severe). Prevalence of exposure to parental violence was 26.1% (7.5% witnessed moderate parental violence and 18.6% severe). Combined analyses of these two types of violence showed significant associations between them. The findings may help implement intervention strategies to call the attention of health professionals to the high prevalence of this type of violence.

An ancestral deuterostome family of two-pore channels mediates nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent calcium release from acidic organelles. Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a potent and widespread calcium-mobilizing messenger, the properties of which have been most extensively described in sea urchin eggs. The molecular basis for calcium release by NAADP, however, is not clear and subject to controversy. Recent studies have provided evidence that members of the two-pore channel (TPC) family in mammals are the long sought after target channels for NAADP. Here, we show that the TPC3 gene, which has yet to be functionally characterized, is present throughout the deuterostome lineage but is a pseudogene in humans and other primates. We report the molecular cloning of the complete ancestral TPC gene family from the sea urchin and demonstrate that all three isoforms localize to acidic organelles to mediate NAADP-dependent calcium release. Our data highlight the functional divergence of this novel gene family during deuterostome evolution and provide further evidence that NAADP mediates calcium release from acidic stores through activation of TPCs.

Firmness measurement of peach by impact force response. The impact force response of a peach impacting on a metal flat-surface was considered as nondestructive determination of firmness. The objectives were to analyze the effect of firmness, drop height, fruit mass, and impact orientation on the impact force parameters, and to establish a relationship between the impact force parameter and firmness. The effect of fruit firmness, drop height and fruit mass on the impact force parameters (coefficient of restitution, percentage of energy absorbed, and coefficient of force-time) was evaluated. The study found that the coefficient of restitution, percentage of energy absorbed, and force-time impact coefficient were significantly affected by fruit ripeness, but not affected by drop height, impact position (fruit cheek), and mass. The percentage of absorbed energy increased with ripeness, while the force-time impact coefficient and coefficient of restitution decreased with ripeness. Relationships were obtained between the three impact characteristic parameters (force-time impact coefficient, coefficient of restitution, and percentage of energy absorbed) and peach firmness using a polynomial model (R(2)=0.932), S model (R(2)=0.910), and exponential model (R(2)=0.941), respectively.

Alemtuzumab versus interleukin-2 receptor antibodies induction in living donor kidney transplantation. Alemtuzumab use has been increasing in kidney transplantation. We aimed to compare posttransplantation outcomes between alemtuzumab and interleukin-2 receptor antibodies (IL-2RA) in living donor kidney transplant recipients in the United States. Organ Procurement Transplant Network/United Network of Organ Sharing data, as of August 2007, were used to identify all living donor kidney transplants performed in adults in the United States from 2003 to 2006 where induction therapy with alemtuzumab or IL-2RA (daclizumab or basiliximab) was used. Primary outcomes included incidence of acute rejection, graft survival, and patient survival. One thousand nine hundred thirteen recipients received alemtuzumab and 7011 received IL-2RA. There were few significant differences in baseline characteristics. The incidence of acute rejection at discharge was lower in the alemtuzumab group, when compared with that in the IL-2RA group (0.8% vs. 4.4%, respectively, P<0.001), but it was similar by 1 year posttransplant (9.8% vs. 11%, respectively). After adjusting for confounding factors, those in alemtuzumab group had a higher adjusted relative risk of graft loss (hazard ratios 1.23, 95% CI 1.03-1.48) in 4 years. Patient survival was comparable between the study groups. A higher rate of acute rejection and graft failure was seen in the recipients who used triple regimen (calcineurin-mycophenolate-steroid) in association with alemtuzumab. The incidence of acute rejection at discharge was lower with alemtuzumab but was comparable with IL-2RA up to 1 year posttransplant. There was no difference in patient survival, but the risk of graft loss among patients who received alemtuzumab was higher compared with those who received IL-2RA induction.

Ten-year results of transscleral resection of large uveal melanomas: local tumour control and metastatic rate. To describe the long-term tumour control and metastatic rate after transscleral resection (TSR) of large uveal melanomas in a single-centre study. The sample included 210 patients with large uveal melanomas. Univariate analysis of local tumour control and metastatic risk by Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank testing. Cox proportional HR analysis with forward and backward selection was used to identify independent prognostic factors in patients submitted to TSR of a large uveal melanoma. A residual tumour was diagnosed in 6% of the patients. The 5- and 10-year local tumour recurrence rates were 24% and 32%, respectively. Older age, a large basal tumour diameter, the lack of adjuvant ruthenium brachytherapy and retinal detachment led to a 2.6, 2.4, 4.4 and 7.8 times higher risk of melanoma recurrence, respectively. The 5- and 10-year metastatic rates were 28% and 44%, respectively, and were statistical significantly affected by extraocular spread, tumour thickness and local tumour recurrence. TSR is an alternative to enucleation for the treatment of large uveal melanomas. Results should improve with better patient selection and more effective methods of adjuvant radiotherapy.

Diagnostic features of real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound in focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver. The typical appearance of focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) in radiological contrast techniques (helical CT or MRI) includes homogeneous enhancement in the arterial phase, but the exact timing for the best visualization of this pattern is unknown. The aim of the present study was to assess the ultrasound pattern of FNH with special attention to real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) appearance and specifically to the timing of perfusion patterns. 72 patients (60 females, 12 males) with a total of 90 FNH nodules with a diameter ranging from 8 to 100 mm (mean +/- SD, 40.6 +/- 21.5 mm) were examined continuously for at least 4 minutes using CnTI and CPS methods (ESAOTE, Genoa, Italy and Acuson-Siemens) after bolus injection of SonoVue (BRACCO, Milan, Italy). 87 of 90 nodules showed the typical coin-like hyperechogenicity in the arterial phase. The remaining three nodules were all in the same patient and were diagnosed as FNH after resection. Contrast started to appear within the lesions after a mean of 15.7 +/- 4.6 seconds (range 7 - 27 s) and reached peak signal intensity, with the greatest differentiation between the lesion and the surrounding parenchyma, at around 22.6 +/- 7.0 seconds (range 14 - 72 s). In the late phase, 65 lesions (72.2 %) became isoechoic (after a mean of 80.8 +/- 85.7 s, range 20 - 300 s), 22 (24.4 %) slightly hyperechoic and 3 (3.3 %) faintly hypoechoic. FNH shows a typical homogeneous hyperechoic pattern during the arterial phase in real-time CEUS which disappears slowly on average but occasionally even as soon as 20 seconds after contrast injection. If the first scans are taken later than 20 seconds after injection (which is still considered to be a full arterial phase), the ultrasound hyperechogenicity may be missed in some cases. Real-time study of these lesions is therefore strongly recommended to avoid possible false-negative results.

Leifsonia lichenia sp. nov., isolated from lichen in Japan. An actinobacterial strain, 2SbT, isolated from lichen was characterized taxonomically using a polyphasic approach. Strain 2SbT was Gram-positive, strictly aerobic, rod-shaped and non-motile. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain 2SbT was located in the genus Leifsonia. Level of 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity between the isolated strains and the type strains of Leifsonia species were 95.0-99.2%. The value of DNA-DNA relatedness between strain 2SbT and Leifsonia poae, a phylogenetically related and phenotypically similar species, was 39.9/25.2%. The DNA G+C content of the strain 2SbT was 61.7 mol%. Cell wall peptidoglycan type (2,4-diaminobutyric acid), major cellular fatty acids (anteiso-C(15:0), anteiso-C(17:0) and iso-C(16:0)) and quinone type (MK-11 and MK-10) of the isolate support their affiliation to the genus Leifsonia. On the basis of phylogenetic position, physiological and chemotaxonomic properties, strain 2SbT represent a novel species of the genus Leifsonia, for which the name Leifsonia lichenia sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is 2SbT (=IAM 15426T =JCM 23226T =KCTC 13122T).


Increasing nursing faculty research: the Iowa gerontological nursing research and regional research consortium strategies.

Water and its role in food and health security--the importance of water to food production. Water is vital to food production: every calorie of plant food requires at least one litre of water, while one calorie of meat or dairy product can require up to 10 litres of water. Water is supplied either through rainfall or through irrigation. Irrigated agriculture uses 18 per cent of agricultural land, and produces 40 per cent of agricultural products. But urbanisation, agricultural land degradation, the mandating of biofuels, drought and climate change are reducing the amount of water available to agriculture. The green revolution of last century doubled cereal production with only a very small increase in land. This century we need a blue revolution, a dramatic increase in the amount of food produced from irrigation or blue water. The blue revolution must be based on knowledge, with that knowledge accessible, and useful, to farmers in both the developed and developing world.

Moral pluralism versus the total view: why Singer is wrong about radical life extension. Peter Singer has argued that we should not proceed with a hypothetical life-extension drug, based on a scenario in which developing the drug would fail to achieve the greatest sum of happiness over time. However, this is the wrong test. If we ask, more simply, which policy would be more benevolent, we reach a different conclusion from Singer's: even given his (admittedly questionable) scenario, development of the drug should go ahead. Singer's rigorous utilitarian position pushes him in the direction of an implausible "total view" utilitarianism when it encounters the problems presented by certain thought experiments. A more pluralistic account of the nature of morality promises to solve these problems, and in this case it reaches a benevolent recommendation on life-extension technology.

Routine opt-out HIV testing strategies in a female jail setting: a prospective controlled trial. Ten million Americans enter jails annually. The objective was to evaluate new CDC guidelines for routine opt-out HIV testing and examine the optimal time to implement routine opt-out HIV testing among newly incarcerated jail detainees. This prospective, controlled trial of routine opt-out HIV testing was conducted among 323 newly incarcerated female inmates in Connecticut's only women's jail. 323 sequential entrants to the women's jail over a five week period in August and September 2007 were assigned to be offered routine opt-out HIV testing at one of three points after incarceration: immediate (same day, n = 108), early (next day, n = 108), or delayed (7 days, n = 107). The primary outcome was the proportion of women in each group consenting to testing. Routine opt-out HIV testing was significantly highest (73%) among the early testing group compared to 55% for immediate and 50% for 7 days post-entry groups. Other factors significantly (p = 0.01) associated with being HIV tested were younger age and low likelihood of early release from jail based on bond value or type of charge for which women were arrested. In this correctional facility, routine opt-out HIV testing in a jail setting was feasible, with highest rates of testing if performed the day after incarceration. Lower testing rates were seen with immediate testing, where there is a high prevalence of inability or unwillingness to test, and with delayed testing, where attrition from jail increases with each passing day.

Characterization of pre-curved needles for steering in tissue. Needles with tip asymmetry deflect upon insertion into soft tissue, an effect that can be used to steer needles within the body. This paper presents a phenomenological characterization of the steering behavior of pre-curved needles, which have tip asymmetry due to curvature of the needle near the tip. We describe needle construction methods and a needle shaft triangulation algorithm to compute the shape of the needle based on images. Experimental results show that pre-curved needles possess greater dexterity than bevel-tipped needles and achieve radii of curvature similar to pre-bent needles. For long pre-curve arc lengths, the radius of curvature of the needle was found to approach the radius of curvature of the pre-curve. Pre-curved needles were found to display behaviors not seen with bevel-tipped needles, such as the insertion velocity influencing the path of the tip within the tissue and the ability to plastically deform the needle during steering.

Racial and ethnic differences in reproductive potential across the life cycle. To review variations in specific reproductive health outcomes by race and ethnicity. A growing number of reports have explored potential gaps in the quality of reproductive health and healthcare across racial and ethnic groups. Diverse results from numerous investigations have made it challenging for practitioners to confirm the significance of these disparities. Three specific areas of the reproductive life cycle were examined: pubertal onset, outcomes from treatment with assisted reproductive technologies (ART), and the menopausal transition. These areas were selected as they encompass a continuum of events across the reproductive life span of women. Outcomes were compared in black, white, Asian, and Hispanic women. Medline searches querying on keywords puberty, IVF, ART, menopause, menopausal symptoms, racial disparity, race, Asian, Japanese, Chinese, African American, black, Hispanic, and Latino were performed to isolate relevant publications for review. Differences across race and ethnicity were noted in each clinical endpoint. The most notable findings included earlier puberty in blacks and Hispanics compared with whites, significantly lower live birth rates after ART in all racial and ethnic groups compared with whites, and differences in perimenopausal symptomatology and possibly timing in various racial/ethnic groups compared with whites. Additional research is needed to completely unravel the full significance and basic underpinnings of these disparities. Some of the limitations of the current state of the literature in drawing conclusions about the independent effect of race/ethnicity on reproductive disparities include small samples sizes in some studies, inconsistencies in the characterization of racial/ethnic groups, and incomplete control of potential confounding. Race and ethnicity appear to be important correlates of outcomes from the initiation of reproduction functioning through to its conclusion. The ultimate goal of identifying racial disparities in reproduction is to isolate the basic determinants of disparities and formulate strategies to improve outcomes for women at risk. The differences demonstrated in this review of the literature could represent environmental, sociocultural, and/or genetic correlates of race that influence these important milestones.

Racial discrimination and physical activity among low-income-housing residents. Although discrimination has been identified as a potential determinant of existing racial/ethnic health disparities, no studies have investigated whether racial discrimination contributes to disparities in physical activity. The primary aim of the current study was to examine the association between interpersonal racial discrimination and physical activity. Baseline data were collected during 2004-2005 among a predominately black and Hispanic sample of adult residents living in 12 low-income-housing sites in Boston MA (n=1055). Residents reported experiences of lifetime racial discrimination during interviewer-administered surveys and wore a pedometer for 5 days to measure physical activity. For analyses, performed in 2009, linear regression models with a cluster design were conducted to predict physical activity, measured as steps per day. Nearly 48% of participants reported ever experiencing racial discrimination, and discrimination was most commonly experienced on the street or in a public setting. No association was found between discrimination and physical activity, when examined in bivariate, multivariable, or race-stratified models. The current results indicate that self-reported racial discrimination is not a key determinant of physical activity among residents living in low-income housing. However, additional research is warranted to address current limitations of this study.

Effects of maximal oxygen uptake test and prolonged cycle ergometer exercise on sway density plot of postural control. This work aims at testing the influence of the maximal oxygen uptake test and prolonged cycle ergometer exercise on sway density plot (SDP) parameters of postural control. Sixteen healthy male subjects were submitted to stabilometric tests with eye open and closed, before and after two different exercises. The maximal oxygen uptake test caused decrease of the mean duration of peaks in SDP, decreasing the stability level, without modify the rates of central and muscular torque controls. Conversely, 60 min exercise increased the mean time interval between two consecutive peaks in SDP, thus decreasing the control rate but not changing the stability level. Visual privation had a greater effect on body sway than these exercises, which were applied to muscles that are not the main actuators in body sway control. Concluding, the changes in postural control are dependent on the intensity and duration of exercise.

Some control-related issues in mini-robotics for endoluminal surgery. This paper introduces some issues related to the development of robotics for endoluminal surgery from control point of view. Endoluminal surgery are incisionless procedures performed through natural orifices within the natural pathways. New devices are then required to achieve these new surgical procedures. Besides the development of new devices, control issues arise in both technological and theoretical aspects. The paper presents some of them and we propose a teleoperation architecture that has already been tested for needle insertion that could be used for teleoperated endoluminal surgery especially for instance for biopsies or anastomoses.

Strengthening individual memories by reactivating them during sleep. While asleep, people heard sounds that had earlier been associated with objects at specific spatial locations. Upon waking, they recalled these locations more accurately than other locations for which no reminder cues were provided. Consolidation thus operates during sleep with high specificity and is subject to systematic influences through simple auditory stimulation.

Use of a three-dimensional, normative database of pediatric craniofacial morphology for modern anthropometric analysis. Surgical correction of cranial abnormalities, including craniosynostosis, requires knowledge of normal skull shape to appreciate dysmorphic variations. However, the inability of current anthropometric techniques to adequately characterize three-dimensional cranial shape severely limits morphologic study. The authors previously introduced three-dimensional vector analysis, a quantitative method that maps cranial form from computed tomography data. In this article, the authors report its role in the development and validation of a normative database of pediatric cranial morphology and in clinical analysis of craniosynostosis. Normal pediatric craniofacial computed tomography data sets were acquired retrospectively from the Duke University Picture Archive and Communications System. Age increments ranging from 1 to 72 months were predetermined for scan acquisition. Three-dimensional vector analysis was performed on individual data sets, generating a set of point clouds. Averages and standard deviations for the age and gender bins of point clouds were used to create normative three-dimensional models. Anthropometric measurements from three-dimensional vector analysis models were compared with published matched data. Preoperative and postoperative morphologies of a sagittal synostosis case were analyzed using three-dimensional vector analysis and the normative database. Three- and two-dimensional representations were created to define age-incremental normative models. Length and width dimensions agreed with previously published data. Detailed morphologic analysis is provided for a case of sagittal synostosis by applying age- and gender-matched data. Three-dimensional vector analysis provides accurate, comprehensive description of cranial morphology with quantitative graphic output. The method enables development of an extensive pediatric normative craniofacial database. Future application of these data will facilitate analysis of cranial anomalies and assist with clinical assessment.

Pandemic influenza as 21st century urban public health crisis. The percentage of the world's population living in urban areas will increase from 50% in 2008 to 70% (4.9 billion) in 2025. Crowded urban areas in developing and industrialized countries are uniquely vulnerable to public health crises and face daunting challenges in surveillance, response, and public communication. The revised International Health Regulations require all countries to have core surveillance and response capacity by 2012. Innovative approaches are needed because traditional local-level strategies may not be easily scalable upward to meet the needs of huge, densely populated cities, especially in developing countries. The responses of Mexico City and New York City to the initial appearance of influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus during spring 2009 illustrate some of the new challenges and creative response strategies that will increasingly be needed in cities worldwide.

Renal outcomes analysis after endovascular and open aortic aneurysm repair. The purpose of this study was to compare renal outcomes (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] and renal volume) after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and open repair (OR) of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). All AAA repairs performed between November 2009 and July 2011 were included in this retrospective study. Patients requiring suprarenal clamping and renal bypass or reimplantation and patients requiring fenestrated endografting were excluded from the OR and EVAR groups, respectively. All EVARs were performed with transrenal proximal fixation. Renal volume (calculated with a three-dimensional workstation) and GFR (estimated with the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula) were evaluated before the procedure, at 12 months after the procedure, and yearly thereafter. The study included 90 patients (41 ORs and 49 EVARs). Both groups were comparable except for age at intervention, body mass index, smoking, peripheral arterial disease, arrhythmia, and vitamin K antagonist treatment. Median follow-up was 2.8 years for OR (2.5-2.9 years) and 3.2 years for EVAR (3.0-3.4 years). In both groups, we found a significant decrease when comparing postoperative estimated GFR with 1-year (14.4% decrease [3.8%-23.8%]; P = .002) and 3-year (12.8% decrease [3.8%-20.9%]; P = .0007) levels. In both groups, total renal volumes significantly diminished. Median preoperative total renal volume (372 cm(3) [311-349]) significantly decreased (6.7% [2.8%-10.5%]; P = .008) between 1 year and 2 years of follow-up. Renal function impairment is similar after open and endovascular AAA repair. It is associated with a decrease in total renal volume, which seems to be an early and constant marker of postoperative renal impairment.

[Determination of the detergent efficiency of the detergents disinfecting for surfaces]. Since the disinfecting activity of disinfectants is evaluated by standards, the intrinsic detergent activity is not easily quantifiable and no standard have been suggested yet. Beyond the physicochemical parameters like wettability or foaming presented by the manufacturers, it appears necessary to us to objectively measure the real effect of the detergent agent. The objective of our work is to propose a simple, fast and reproducible method to evaluate detersive activity of the disinfecting detergents. We measured three factors (total amount of extracted bacteria, extraction efficiency and slope of extracting curve) by using Rodac prints technique on two different supports (PVC, stainless steel) that have been contaminated by either E. coli or S. aureus. An increasing mark from 1 to 6 is given to each of these factors in case of statistically differences. The three factors allowed us to calculate a "Specific Index of detersion" (SI) for each germ/support couple (3 to 18). Addition of the marks given to each couple for each disinfecting detergent allowed to calculate a "Globally Index of detersion" (GI) (9 to 72). We tested 4 commercialised disinfecting detergents: Surfanios, Aniosurf, Major C100 and Ecodiol. All detergents may be classified according to their effectiveness on a bacterium/support couple (value of the SI). This enlights a specific spectrum for each disinfecting detergents. As a result, Ecodiol seems to be the most effective deterging agent on 3 of the 4 germ/support couples (S. aureus/PVC, E. coli/PVC and E. coli/stainless steel), whereas Aniosurf is most effective on the S. aureus/stainless steel couple. The GI is very useful to choose the best compromise between activities for all situations. GI rankings of the tested agents were as follows: water < Aniosurf < Surfanios < neutralizing < Major C100 < Ecodiol. This experimental model will be used to test and compare the intrinsic detergent activities of other commercialised products which are usually used for the biocleaning of the medical devices (i.e. endoscopes or reusable dialysis device).

Paramutation: the tip of an epigenetic iceberg? Paramutation describes the transfer of an acquired epigenetic state to an unlinked homologous locus, resulting in a meiotically heritable alteration in gene expression. Early investigations of paramutation characterized a mode of change and inheritance distinct from mendelian genetics, catalyzing the concept of the epigenome. Numerous examples of paramutation and paramutation-like phenomena have now emerged, with evidence that implicates small RNAs in the transfer and maintenance of epigenetic states. In animals Piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)-mediated retrotransposon suppression seems to drive a vast system of epigenetic inheritance with paramutation-like characteristics. The classic examples of paramutation might be merely informative aberrations of pervasive and broadly conserved mechanisms that use RNA to sense homology and target epigenetic modification. When viewed in this context, paramutation is only one aspect of a common and broadly distributed form of inheritance based on epigenetic states.

Decreased numeric density of succinic dehydrogenase-positive mitochondria in CA1 pyramidal neurons of 3xTg-AD mice. Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. In this study, we investigated succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) activity in mitochondria of hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons obtained from 10-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, an animal model of AD, as well as from age-matched control mice PS1-KI. In SDH-positive mitochondria, we measured numeric density (Nv, number of mitochondria/microm(3) of cytoplasm), average organelle volume (V), volume density (Vv, volume fraction of mitochondria/microm(3) of cytoplasm), average length (Fmax), and the ratio (R) between the total area of the cytochemical precipitate due to SDH activity and the total mitochondrial area. Our results indicate that 3xTg-AD mitochondria show a significant decrease of Nv, increase in V and Fmax, as well as a trend toward a reduction of R, whereas Vv is unchanged. Our findings further support the idea that mitochondrial dysfunction is involved in AD and are in line with studies indicating that both amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid-beta (Abeta) localize to mitochondria.

Chronic kidney disease as a predictor of coronary lesion morphology. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the main cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). We investigated whether CKD stage affected coronary lesion morphology in patients with established CAD. Coronary angiograms of 264 patients were evaluated. Chronic kidney disease was staged using the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from the serum creatinine prior to coronary angiography. Patients were divided into 3 groups: dialysis or severe decrease in GFR <30 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (group 1; n = 60), patients with moderate kidney failure (group 2; n = 116), and patients with normal renal function or mild decrease in GFR (group 3; n = 88). The likelihood of CAD and lesion complexity increased with decreasing eGFR (P = .001). Patients with CKD also had more significant CAD. The risk of significant coronary obstruction and lesion complexity increased progressively with decreasing eGFR. The eGFR may predict lesion complexity among patients with CKD undergoing coronary angiography.


Bing-Neel syndrome: a case report and systematic review of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment options.

Reduction of the onset response in high frequency nerve block with amplitude ramps from non-zero amplitudes. High frequency alternating current (HFAC) waveforms reversibly block conduction in mammalian peripheral nerves. The initiation of the HFAC produces an onset response in the nerve before complete block occurs. An amplitude ramp, starting from zero amplitude, is ineffective in eliminating this onset response. In fact, it makes the onset worse. We postulated that initiating the ramp from a non-zero amplitude would produce a different effect on the onset. This was tested in an in-vivo rat sciatic nerve model. HFAC was applied at supra block threshold amplitudes and then reduced to a lower amplitude (0%, 25% 50 %, 75% and 90% of the suprathreshold amplitude). The amplitude was then increased again to the original supra block threshold amplitude. This normally produces a second period of onset response if increased as a step. However, an amplitude ramp was successful in eliminating this onset. This was always possible for the ramps up from 50%, 75 % and 90% block threshold amplitude, but never from 0% or 25% of the block threshold amplitude. This maneuver can potentially be used to maintain complete nerve block, transition to partial block and then resume complete block without initiating another onset.

Eicosapentaenoic acid increases cytochrome P-450 2J2 gene expression and epoxyeicosatrienoic acid production via peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor Î³ in endothelial cells. Ï-3 fatty acids, such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), have beneficial effects on cardiovascular diseases. Cytochrome P-450 (CYP) 2J2 that is expressed in endothelial cells metabolizes arachidonic acids to biologically active epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) that possess anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects. We studied the effects of EPA and DHA on the expression of CYP 2J2 mRNA by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and found that EPA, but not DHA, increased the expression of CYP 2J2 mRNA in a dose-dependent and a time-dependent manner. EPA-induced CYP 2J2 expression was significantly inhibited by pretreatment with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) Î³ antagonist, GW9662. EPA, but not DHA, caused a significant increase in cellular levels of 11,12-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid that is a stable metabolite of 11,12-EET, which was blocked by pretreatment with GW9662. These data demonstrate that EPA increases CYP 2J2 mRNA expression and 11,12-EET production via PPARÎ³ in endothelial cells and indicate a novel protective role of EPA and PPARÎ³ against vascular inflammation.

Case Report of Autopsy and Placental Examination After Radiofrequency Ablation of an Acardiac Twin. We report the autopsy and placental findings in a monochorionic twin gestation complicated by twin reversed arterial perfusion (TRAP) sequence. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) was performed at 24 weeks gestation to abort the acardiac fetus, and vaginal delivery of the co-twin and acardiac fetus occurred at 33 weeks gestation. An autopsy of the acardiac fetus revealed multiple congenital anomalies including complete absence of the upper extremities and poor development of the skull and facial structures. In contrast to the upper body, the lower half of the body, although malformed, was more developed. The monochorionic twin placenta showed velamentous, atrophied, proximal artery-artery and vein-vein intertwin vascular connections which essentially bypassed the placental parenchyma for the acardiac fetus. Ink injection and histologic examination confirmed thrombosis of these critical intertwin vascular connections after RFA. This report highlights the fetal and placental anatomy of TRAP sequence and stresses the importance of placental examination after fetal surgical techniques.

Reversal of nail changes after liver transplantation in a child. We report a 6-year-old girl who received a left-lobe live-related liver transplant for decompensated liver disease after a failed Kasai's surgery for biliary atresia. Preoperatively, her nails were white, dystrophic, brittle with severe onycholysis, clubbing and watch-glass deformities. Nail scrapings were negative for fungus. Five months after transplantation, her nails had become near normal. There is only one such documented case in literature on reversal of nail changes in an adult.

Changes in material flows, treatment efficiencies and shifting of environmental loads in the wastewater treatment sector. Part I: case study of the Netherlands. The material that is separated from wastewater in wastewater treatment plants has to be transferred from the water phase to the atmosphere, lithosphere, and/or biosphere (and also the technosphere). After the initial discharges into the different environmental media (and the technosphere), there are further 'inter-sphere' leakages or redirections. However, these happen over protracted periods of time and have not been accounted for in this paper. The paper presents a case study on the wastewater treatment plants in the Netherlands, examines how the degree of separation of COD (BOD), nitrogen, phosphorus and heavy metals from the wastewater have increased over time, and studies the changes in proportions separated out to the atmosphere and lithosphere. The hydrosphere has benefited from a decline in the degree of eutrophication and marine/fresh water toxicity, owing to the favourable combination of higher degrees of separation, over time, and source control, especially in the industrial sector. Global warming is a major concern owing to the increasing conversion of COD to carbon dioxide (and methane). Heavy metal and nitrogen emissions have been curbed thanks to source reduction within industries. Technologies have, of course, enabled some mitigation of the problems associated with atmospheric (global warming and toxicity) and lithospheric (toxicity) pollution, though these are beyond the scope of this paper, which assumes a hypothetical worst-case scenario in this regard for the study period 1993-2005.

The influence of surgical procedure and the effect of chemotherapy on nodal and distant metastases of human malignant melanomas that have been grafted into nude mice. Malignant melanoma of the oral mucosa is common in Japan. The effects on metastasis of puncturing the tumor before surgery or using chemotherapy after extirpation of the tumor were studied using animal models. G-361 cells were transplanted subcutaneously into mice. In half the animals, the subcutaneous tumor was punctured with an 18G needle twice a week from 2 weeks after transplantation until death. In the other mice, the subcutaneous tumor was extirpated 6 weeks after transplantation; the animals were killed 2 weeks later. Dimethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide (DTIC) or cisplatin (CDDP) were injected into the peritoneal cavity 3 days before extirpation or during extirpation. Metastases to the axilla lymph node and the lung were examined in both groups. The animals that received puncturing developed lymph node and pulmonary metastasis earlier and more frequently than those without puncturing. 50% of mice that received no anticancer agent, had lymph node and pulmonary metastases after tumor extirpation. Preoperative DTIC or CDDP reduced the frequency of metastasis to 25-35%. DTIC or CDDP administration during extirpation, significantly reduced the metastasis rate to 7-10%. Prognosis for oral melanoma patients may be better when surgery and postoperative chemotherapy are performed simultaneously without preoperative surgical procedures.


A clinic-based lifestyle intervention for pediatric obesity: efficacy and behavioral and biochemical predictors of response.

Antiangiogenic activity of herboxidiene via downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î±. Antiangiogenesis is now thought of as one of the most important approaches for anticancer therapy. In this study, we determined the antiangiogenic property of herboxidiene, a polyketide natural product. Herboxidiene effectively inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) at concentrations not exhibiting cytotoxicity. Furthermore, the natural product significantly suppressed vascular endothelial growth factor-induced invasion and tube formation in HUVECs as well as neovascularization of the chorioallantoic membrane in developing chick embryos. We also identified an association between the antiangiogenic activity of herboxidiene and the downregulation of both the phosphorylation of VEGF receptor 2 (KDR/Flk-1) and the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1Î± at the transcriptional level. These results suggest that herboxidiene functions as a potential antiangiogenic agent and may be applicable for anticancer therapy by targeting tumor angiogenesis. 

Burden of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Medicare beneficiaries residing in long-term care facilities. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. COPD increases health care resource utilization and spending and adversely affects quality of life. Data from the clinical and economic outcomes in Medicare beneficiaries with COPD who reside in long-term care (LTC) facilities are limited. The purpose of this study was to investigate the clinical and economic outcomes associated with COPD in Medicare beneficiaries residing in LTC facilities. This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from MarketScan Medicaid, a large US administrative claims database containing data on Medicaid programs in 8 states. The study cohort comprised LTC facility residents aged > or =60 years who had a diagnosis of COPD. Eligible patients also had a prescription filled between January 1, 2003, and June 30, 2005, for one of the following COPD treatments: fluticasone propionate + salmeterol xinafoate, tiotropium bromide, ipratropium bromide, or ipratropium bromide + albuterol sulfate. The date of the first prescription fill was considered the index date. Measures of health care resource utilization included COPD-related and all-cause hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits. Cost analysis outcomes included COPD-related and all-cause inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, LTC, and total costs during the 12-month postindex period. Data from 3037 patients were included (63.0% women; 82.2% white; mean [SD] age, 78.1 [10.0] years). A total of 43.3% of patients had > or =1 hospitalization; 90.0%, > or =1 ED visit. With the exception of age <70 years, age was associated with all-cause hospitalization (age 70-<75 years, hazard ratio [HR] = 1.31 [95% CI, 1.03-1.68]; age 75-<80 years, HR = 1.40 [95% CI, 1.11-1.78]; age > or =80 years, HR = 1.48 [95% CI, 1.19-1.85]). Age was not associated with COPD-related hospitalization, all-cause ED visits, or COPD-related ED visits. The risk for all-cause hospitalization in white patients was significantly lower compared with that in nonwhite patients (HR = 0.79 [95% CI, 0.69-0.91]). Patients with comorbid asthma had a higher risk for a COPD-related ED visit (HR = 1.34 [95% CI, 1.08-1.66]) than did patients without asthma. Preindex all-cause hospitalization was associated with COPD-related hospitalization (HR = 1.78 [95% CI, 1.49-2.14]) and all-cause hospitalization (HR = 2.05 [95% CI, 1.932.19]). Twelve-month COPD-related and all-cause direct expenditures per beneficiary were US $7391 and $48,183. In COPD-related and all-cause estimates, mean (SD) LTC costs were the largest cost components ($5629 [$12,562] and $32,966 [$14,871], respectively), followed by pharmacy costs ($956 [$957] and $5565 [$3873]), inpatient costs ($466 [$3393] and $6436 [$22,603]), and outpatient costs ($341 [$1793] and $3216 [$6458]). This study found that the utilization of health care resources and economic burden of LTC residents with COPD were primarily due to LTC, pharmacy, and inpatient costs.


"I-MOVE" towards monitoring seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine effectiveness: lessons learnt from a pilot multi-centric case-control study in Europe, 2008-9.

Early changes in the biophysical properties of the aorta in pre-adolescent children born small for gestational age. To assess the biophysical properties of the aorta in children born small for gestational age (SGA) with an echo-Doppler method and to determine associations with known perinatal risk factors. In this cross-sectional study, 39 SGA and 41 control subjects aged 8 to 13 years were recruited. Perinatal risk factors were recorded. The aortic diameters and pulse wave transit time around the aortic arch were measured with echo-Doppler and the blood pressure recorded. Pulse wave velocity, aortic input impedance (Zi), characteristic impedance (Zc), arterial pressure-strain elastic modulus (Ep), and arterial wall stiffness index (beta-index) were calculated. Pulse wave velocity (374 +/- 46 vs 348 +/- 47 cm/sec, P < .02); Zi (177 +/- 39 vs 142 +/- 27 dynes x sec/cm(5), P < .0001); Zc (185 +/- 29 vs 152 +/- 37 dynes x sec/cm(5), P < .0001); Ep (286 +/- 101 vs 216 +/- 41 mm Hg, P < .0001); and beta-index (2.43 +/- 0.32 vs 2.17 +/- 0.15, P < .0001) were all higher in SGA. We found negative associations between the following: birth weight and Zi, Zc, Ep, and beta-index; as well as body mass index and Zi, Zc. This simple echo-Doppler method demonstrated abnormal biophysical properties of the aorta in a cohort of pre-adolescent patients born SGA who remain small in stature and continue to have normal blood pressure.


Shift work aggravates metabolic syndrome development among early-middle-aged males with elevated ALT.

Requisite role of the cholinergic alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor pathway in suppressing Gram-negative sepsis-induced acute lung inflammatory injury. Although activation of the alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 nAChR) modulates the response to sepsis, the role of this pathway in the development of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI) is not known. In this study, we addressed the contribution of alpha7 nAChR in mediating endotoxin- and live Escherichia coli-induced ALI in mice. Because we found that alpha7 nAChR(+) alveolar macrophages and neutrophils were present in bronchoalveolar lavage and injured lungs of mice, we tested whether acetylcholine released by lung vagal innervation stimulated these effector cells and thereby down-regulated proinflammatory chemokine/cytokine generation. Administration of alpha7 nAChR agonists reduced bronchoalveolar lavage MIP-2 production and transalveolar neutrophil migration and reduced mortality in E. coli pneumonia mice, whereas vagal denervation increased MIP-2 production and airway neutrophil accumulation and increased mortality. In addition, alpha7 nAChR(-/-) mice developed severe lung injury and had higher mortality compared with alpha7 nAChR(+/+) mice. The immunomodulatory cholinergic alpha7 nAChR pathway of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils blocked LPS- and E. coli-induced ALI by reducing chemokine production and transalveolar neutrophil migration, suggesting that activation of alpha7 nAChR may be a promising strategy for treatment of sepsis-induced ALI.

The disappearing defined benefit pension and its potential impact on the retirement incomes of baby boomers. This article uses a microsimulation model to estimate how freezing all remaining private-sector and one-third of all public-sector defined benefit (DB) pension plans over the next 5 years would affect retirement incomes of baby boomers. If frozen plans were supplemented with new or enhanced defined contribution (DC) retirement plans, there would be more losers than winners, and average family incomes would decline. The decline in family income would be much larger for last-wave boomers born from 1961 through 1965 than for those born from 1946 through 1950, because younger boomers are more likely to have their DB pensions frozen with relatively little job tenure. Higher DC accruals would raise retirement incomes for some families by more than their lost DB benefits. But about 26 percent of last-wave boomers would have lower family incomes at age 67, and only 11 percent would see their income increase.

Changes in the tinnitus handicap questionnaire after cochlear implantation. To determine (a) changes in the Tinnitus Handicap Questionnaire (THQ) for patients using cochlear implants, (b) differences between patients who receive total or partial relief, and (c) identifiable characteristics of those who report tinnitus after implantation. Pre- and postoperatively, 244 adults were administered the THQ when they reported tinnitus. Of the 153 patients who had tinnitus preoperatively, 94 (61%) patients reported total suppression and 59 (39%) reported a partial reduction. In 91 patients who did not have tinnitus before implantation, 11 (12%) reported tinnitus postimplantation. The THQ score decreased from 41% preimplant to 30% postimplant. The largest reductions involved social handicap and hearing. Patients with a more severe hearing loss might be more likely to experience an exacerbation of their tinnitus. We were not able to clearly identify differences between patients who received total or partial relief and the characteristics of patients who reported tinnitus after implantation. Those who acquired tinnitus had the shortest duration hearing loss (5.6 years) and were the oldest (63 years). The average THQ score of patients getting tinnitus was 29%. Most tinnitus patients benefit from receiving a cochlear implant.

Relation of quantitative visual and neurologic outcomes to fatigue in multiple sclerosis. The relation of fatigue in multiple sclerosis (MS) to the visual system, an emerging structural and functional surrogate in MS, has not been well established. We examined how physical and cognitive fatigue could be associated with visual dysfunction and neurologic impairment. At a single time-point, we assessed 143 patients with: Low-contrast letter acuity (LCLA) and high-contrast visual acuity (VA) testing, the 25-Item National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ-25) and Neuro-Ophthalmic Supplement, the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), the MS Functional Composite (MSFC), and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). Worse binocular LCLA scores were associated with increased levels of total and physical fatigue (pâ¤0.026). Greater levels of fatigue were also associated with reduced vision-specific QOL (p<0.001). Patients with more physical, but not cognitive, fatigue had greater levels of impairment by the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25W, r=0.39, p<0.001), 9-Hole Peg Test (9HP r=0.22, p=0.011) and EDSS (r=0.45, p<0.001). Reduced vision in MS is highly associated with physical fatigue and could be used to capture more global, difficult to describe, symptoms. The potential differences in physical vs. cognitive fatigue and their correlates may begin to provide insight into their underlying mechanisms.

Adult orbital xanthogranulomatous disease: review of the literature. This article provides an overview of the pathologic features of adult orbital xanthogranulomatous disease, a rare heterogeneous group of disorders that includes 4 clinical syndromes: adult-onset xanthogranuloma, necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, adult-onset asthma and periocular xanthogranuloma, and Erdheim-Chester disease. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of the lesion, demonstrating tissue infiltration by the hallmarks of xanthoma cells and Touton giant cells. The differential diagnosis is broad, including syndromes within the adult xanthogranulomatous disease category as well as other entities involving the eyelid and the orbital tissues. Because of its rarity and sometimes close similarity to other disease entities, it is often misdiagnosed initially. This article focuses on the morphology and immunohistochemical patterns in diagnosis of adult orbital xanthogranulomatous disease with emphasis on adult-onset asthma and periocular xanthogranuloma in particular, its clinical features and associated systemic manifestations in differential diagnosis, as well as the current management strategy.

Does thighplasty for upper thigh laxity after massive weight loss require a vertical incision? After massive weight loss (MWL), many patients present with concerns about skin excess and laxity. The thigh is one of the more complex regions to address in MWL patients because of the differing degree, location, and quality of skin excess and fatty tissue, as well as surgical risk factors. The authors describe a technique called the anterior proximal extended (APEX) thighlift to effectively treat upper thigh skin excess with a hidden scar while also enhancing adjacent body regions. A review was performed of 97 MWL patients who underwent thighlift surgery between March 1998 and October 2007. Eighty-six women and 11 men, with average weight loss of 146 lb and average body mass index (BMI) at contouring of 29.8, were included in the study. The risk factors that were assessed included age, gender, medical conditions, tobacco use, BMI, weight of skin excised, and surgery performed. The outcomes that were assessed included wound healing and lymphedema. Extended vertical thighlift was performed in 11 patients and anterior superior thighlift in 86 patients. Complications of thighlift included wound healing problems (n = 18; 18.6%); lymphedema (n = 8; 8.3%); cellulitis (n = 7; 7.2%); seroma (n = 3; 3.1%); and bleeding (n = 1; 1%). On multivariate statistical analysis, age and BMI were found to impair healing in the entire thighlift group. For patients with a BMI greater than or equal to 35, the odds ratio (OR) for a wound healing complication was 13.7 (P = .03). Hypothyroidism was strongly associated with lymphedema, with an OR of 23 (P = .06). Extended thighlift trended toward lymphedema (OR = 16.7; P = .08). Thighlift can be a satisfying procedure for both the patient and surgeon because it provides aesthetic improvement in terms of skin excess and laxity. The APEX thighlift is a new technique that expands upon those previously described in the literature to effectively treat upper thigh laxity with a hidden scar after MWL.

A meta-analysis of the effects of conjugated linoleic acid on fat-free mass in humans. Treatment of laboratory animals with a 50:50 mixture of c9,t11 and t10,c12 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) results in fat loss and, to a smaller degree, fat-free mass (FFM) gain. In a previous meta-analysis, we found that CLA produced a fat loss, but that humans were not as responsive as mice. We performed a similar meta-analysis in the same 18 studies to test whether CLA increased FFM. Only placebo-controlled trials that measured body composition were included. We found that FFM increased during CLA treatment (0.3 +/- 0.7 kg; p = 0.05), but that the change did not display an effect of length of treatment (0.001 +/- 0.005 kg.week(-1); p = 0.8), or an effect of dosage (0.1 +/- 0.1 kg.g CLA(-1).day(-1); p = 0.3). We conclude that FFM does increase in humans during CLA treatment, but the onset of the increase is rapid and the total increase is small (<1%).

Assessing Helping and Hurting Behaviors Through the Tangram Help/Hurt Task. Across six studies, we validated a new measure of helpful and hurtful behaviors, the Tangram Help/Hurt Task. Studies 1 to 3 provided cross-sectional correlational convergent and discriminant validity evidence for the Tangram Task using college-based and adult online samples. Study 4 revealed that previously validated empathy primes increase helpful behaviors on the Tangram Task. Studies 5 and 6 revealed that previously validated provocation manipulations increase hurtful behaviors on the Tangram Task. The effects of various experimental manipulations on the Tangram Task were similar to or larger than on other established indices of helpful and hurtful behaviors. In addition, motivation items in all studies indicate that tangram choices are indeed associated with the intent of helping and hurting. We discuss the advantages and limitations of the Tangram Help/Hurt Task relative to established measures of helpful and hurtful behaviors. 

Effective removal of leptin via hemodiafiltration with on-line endogenous reinfusion therapy. Leptin is a middle-molecular weight uremic toxin. Hemodiafiltration with on-line endogenous reinfusion (HFR) is a novel dialytic method combining the processes of diffusion, convection and adsorption. We performed a prospective crossover study of patients with end-stage renal disease to investigate the effect of HFR therapy on the level of leptin as compared to conventional low flux hemodialysis (LHD). Eleven stable hemodialysis patients were treated with LHD for 12 weeks and then treated with HFR (SG30 Plus; Sorin Group Italia S.r.1, Mirandola, Italy) for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of HFR treatment, serum leptin levels significantly decreased (17.1 (2.66 - 39.5) at Week 12 vs. 12.3 (1.80 - 24.3) ng/ml at Week 24, p = 0.014). Although serum adiponectin levels also decreased (1.66 (1.44 - 1.86) at Week 12 vs. 1.12 (0.79 - 1.34) g/ml at Week 24, p = 0.001), the ratio of leptin to adiponectin did not increase after HFR treatment. Serum beta2-microglobulin (beta2M) levels significantly decreased (37.7 (29.8 - 42.6) at Week 12 vs. 28.3 (26.5 - 32.2) mg/dl at Week 24, p = 0.002). Dry weight, Kt/V(urea), normalized protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance, subjective global assessment, and serum albumin levels of the patients were not changed after HFR treatment. There was no difference in the serum levels of C-reactive protein or interleukin-6 between Week 12 and Week 24. The results of our study indicate that HFR may be a better therapy than LHD for removal of middle-molecular-weight uremic toxins such as leptin and b2M.

Comparative study of two image space noise reduction methods for computed tomography: bilateral filter and nonlocal means. Optimal noise control is important for improving image quality and reducing radiation dose in computed tomography. Here we investigated two image space based nonlinear filters for noise reduction: the bilateral filter (BF) and the nonlocal means (NLM) algorithm. Images from both methods were compared against those from a commercially available weighted filtered backprojection (WFBP) method. A standard phantom for quality assurance testing was used to quantitatively compare noise and spatial resolution, as well as low contrast detectability (LCD). Additionally, an image dataset from a patient's abdominal CT exam was used to assess the effectiveness of the filters on full dose and simulated half dose acquisitions. We found that both the BF and NLM methods improve the tradeoff between noise and high contrast spatial resolution with no significant difference in LCD. Results from the patient dataset demonstrated the potential of dose reduction with the denoising methods. Care must be taken when choosing the NLM parameters in order to minimize the generation of artifacts that could possibly compromise diagnostic value.

Analysis of small RNA in fission yeast; centromeric siRNAs are potentially generated through a structured RNA. The formation of heterochromatin at the centromeres in fission yeast depends on transcription of the outer repeats. These transcripts are processed into siRNAs that target homologous loci for heterochromatin formation. Here, high throughput sequencing of small RNA provides a comprehensive analysis of centromere-derived small RNAs. We found that the centromeric small RNAs are Dcr1 dependent, carry 5'-monophosphates and are associated with Ago1. The majority of centromeric small RNAs originate from two remarkably well-conserved sequences that are present in all centromeres. The high degree of similarity suggests that this non-coding sequence in itself may be of importance. Consistent with this, secondary structure-probing experiments indicate that this centromeric RNA is partially double-stranded and is processed by Dicer in vitro. We further demonstrate the existence of small centromeric RNA in rdp1Delta cells. Our data suggest a pathway for siRNA generation that is distinct from the well-documented model involving RITS/RDRC. We propose that primary transcripts fold into hairpin-like structures that may be processed by Dcr1 into siRNAs, and that these siRNAs may initiate heterochromatin formation independent of RDRC activity.

Changes of calf muscle-tendon properties due to stretching and active movement of children with cerebral palsy--a pilot study. A portable ankle rehabilitation robot with intelligent stretching and game-based active movement training was used to treat the spastic impaired ankle of children with cerebral palsy over six weeks. The subject's calf muscles and Achilles tendon properties were evaluated before and after treatment using ultrasonography and biomechanical measures. It was found that there were decreased Achilles tendon resting length (2.5%), increased cross-sectional area (5.5%), increased stiffness (22.9%), increased Young's modulus (13.8%), decreased soleus muscle fascicular stiffness (53.7%), and decreased medial gastrocnemius fascicular stiffness (46.1%).

Study of floristic diversity and the structural dynamics of some species providers of non woody forest products in the vegetable formations of the Centre East of Burkina Faso. The goal of this study is to contribute to a better knowledge of certain species providing Non Woody Forest Products (NWFP) in the Centre East of Burkina Faso. This study aims to determine the state of the resources in Vitellaria paradoxa, Balanites aegyptiaca, Tamarindus indica and Lannea microcarpa. For this purpose, an inventory of the vegetation was carried out in circular pieces of land of 1250 m2, as a sample of the zone of work, based on the chart of occupation of the grounds. We are identified 158 species comprising 90 genera and 47 families. Those species represent more than 90% of the trees from which various parts are used in food, traditional pharmacopeia and the craft industry. We also showed that because of the strong anthropisation of the zone, the bad pedoclimatic conditions and the permanent bush fires, the regeneration and growth of Vitellaria paradoxa, Balanites aegyptiaca, Tamarindus indica and Lannea microcarpa are disturbed.

[Molecular biological approaches to differential diagnosis of skin melanoma]. Twenty-two surgical biopsy specimens from patients with pigmented skin neoplasms were studied. The patients were divided into 3 groups: 1) 11 patients who had a histological verified diagnosis of melanoma; 2) 10 patients who were diagnosed as having nevi with lentiginous melanocytic dysplasia; 3) 1 patient who had an unclear diagnosis of presumptively, nevus with melanocytic dysplasia. By applying fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) by means of a Vysis LSI RREBI/LSI MYB/LSI CCNDI/ CEP 6 probe, the authors employed to test a new probe designed for the genetic diagnosis of melanoma by FISH studies and confirmed in all the 22 patients the diagnosis previously made from the results of the routine histological study and the presumptive diagnosis in 1 patient. Furthermore, it should be noted that multiple genetic disorders were revealed in 3 patients (14% of the total sample and 30% of the sample of patients diagnosed as having nevus with lentiginous melanocytic dysplasia) in the absence of the morphological criteria of melanoma. The patients with such disorders belong to a risk group and need a more meticulous further follow-up.

Effect of immobilized collagen type IV on biological properties of endothelial cells for the enhanced endothelialization of synthetic vascular graft materials. Regeneration of healthy endothelium onto vascular graft materials is imperative for prevention of intimal hyperplasia and thrombogenesis. In this study, we investigated the effect of collagen type IV (COL-IV) immobilized onto electrospun nanofibers on modulation of endothelial cell (EC) function, as a potential signal to rapid endothelialization of vascular grafts. COL-IV is assembled in basement membrane underneath intimal layer and regulates morphogenesis of blood vessels. For immobilization of COL-IV, poly(l-lactic acid) (PLLA) nanofibers (PL) were prepared as a model vascular graft substrate, onto which acrylic acid (AAc) was then grafted by using gamma-ray irradiation. AAc graft was dependent on irradiation doses and AAc concentrations, which allowed us to select the condition of 5% (v/v) AAc and 10 kGy for further conjugation of COL-IV. COL-IV immobilization was proportionally controlled as a function of its concentration. Atomic force microscope (AFM) analysis qualitatively supported immobilization of COL-IV, demonstrating increase in root mean square roughness of the PL from 665.37 Â± 13.20 nm to 1440.74 Â± 33.24. However, the Young's modulus of nanofibers was retained as approximately 1 MPa, regardless of surface modification. The number of ECs attached on the nanofibers with immobilized COL-IV was significantly increased by 5 times (1052 Â± 138 cells/mm(2)) from pristine PL (234 Â± 41 cells/mm(2)). In addition, the effect of immobilized COL-IV was profound for enhancing proliferation and up-regulation of markers implicated in rapid endothelialization. Collectively, our results suggest that COL-IV immobilized onto electrospun PLLA nanofibers may serve as a promising instructive cue used in vascular graft materials.

Chemical fate and biological effects of several endocrine  disrupters compounds in two echinoderm species. Two echinoderm species, the sea urchin Paracentrotus lividus and the feather star Antedon mediterranea, were exposed for 28 days to several EDCs: three putative androgenic compounds, triphenyltin (TPT), fenarimol (FEN), methyltestosterone (MET), and two putative antiandrogenic compounds, p,p'-DDE (DDE) and cyproterone acetate (CPA). The exposure nominal concentrations were from 10 to 3000 ng L(-1), depending on the compound. This paper is an attempt to join three different aspects coming from our ecotoxicological tests: (1) the chemical behaviour inside the experimental system; (2) the measured toxicological endpoints; (3) the biochemical responses, to which the measured endpoints may depend. The chemical fate of the different compounds was enquired by a modelling approach throughout the application of the 'Aquarium model'. An estimation of the day-to-day concentration levels in water and biota were obtained together with the amount assumed each day by each animal (uptake in microg animal(-1) d(-1) or ng g-wet weight(-1) d(-1)). The toxicological endpoints investigated deal with the reproductive potential (gonad maturation stage, gonad index and oocyte diameter) and with the regenerative potential (growth and histology). Almost all the compounds exerted some kind of effect at the tested concentrations, however TPT was the most effective in altering both reproductive and regenerative parameters (also at the concentration of few ng L(-1)). The biochemical analyses of testosterone (T) and 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) also showed the ability of the selected compounds to significantly alter endogenous steroid concentrations.

Criminalising HIV transmission: punishment without protection. Allegations of the reckless or intentional transmission of HIV raise challenging questions about how states can best address a disease which is transmitted primarily through behaviours that both states and community "police" in different ways. This paper argues that in the rare cases in which someone engages in specific behaviour with the intent to infect another person with HIV, existing laws such as laws against battery are sufficient to allow for the application of the criminal law. It discusses three key points: the potential consequences of new laws criminalising the transmission of HIV, why vague laws criminalising the knowing transmission of HIV fail to meet key requirements of criminal law and are an abuse of the state's policing power, and thirdly, the growing inclusion of such laws within sexual offences legislation. Laws criminalising the transmission of HIV risk bringing within the scope of legal sanction people living with HIV who are acting in ways that do not merit punishment and may as a result of prosecution face adverse human rights consequences.


Barriers to treatment seeking for anxiety disorders: initial data on the role of mental health literacy.

Corticosteroid injection treatment to the ischiadic spine reduced pain in women with long-lasting sacral low back pain with onset during pregnancy: a randomized, double blind, controlled trial. Randomized double blind controlled clinical trial. To evaluate the pain relief effect of locally injected corticosteroid treatment in women with long-lasting sacral low back pain with onset during pregnancy. Pregnancy-related low back pain is a global problem. Almost 1 of 10 women still experienced disabling daily back pain 2 years after childbirth with high impact on the individual, family, and society. On spite of this, the sources of pain and effective treatment are uncertain. Thirty-six women were allocated to injection treatment, with slow-release triamcinolone and lidocaine or saline and lidocaine, given at the sacrospinous ligament insertion on the ischiadic spine bilaterally with 4 weeks follow-up time. Primary outcome measure was reported pain intensity on visual analogue scale and secondary outcome measures number of pain-drawing locations and pain-provoking test results. RESULTS.: The triamcinolone treatment group had significantly reduced pain intensity, number of pain locations, and pain-provoking test results between baseline and follow-up as compared with the saline treatment group. The absolute median change of visual analogue scale score in the triamcinolone treatment group was -24 mm and in the saline group +4.5 mm (P < 0.05). A reduced number of pain drawing locations was reported by 16 of 18 women in the triamcinolone group as compared with 10 of 18 in the saline group (P < 0.05). In the triamcinolone treatment group, 17 of 18 women had an improved pain provocation test result as compared with 9 of 18 in the saline treatment group (P < 0.01). The anatomic region around the sacrospinous ligament insertion on the ischial spine is suggested to be one source of long-lasting sacral low back pain with onset during pregnancy. The pain was relieved by slow-release corticosteroid injection treatment to the ischial spine.

fMRI activation pattern recognition: A novel application of PCA in language network of pediatric localization related epilepsy. In this study, a novel application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is proposed to detect language activation map patterns. These activation patterns were obtained by processing functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) studies on both control and localization related epilepsy (LRE) patients as they performed an auditory word definition task. Most group statistical analyses of fMRI datasets look for "commonality" under the assumption of the homogeneity of the sample. However, inter-subject variance may be expected to increase in large "normal" or otherwise heterogeneous patient groups. In such cases, certain different patterns may share a common feature, comprising of small categorical sub-groups otherwise hidden within the main pooling statistical procedure. These variant patterns may be of importance both in normal and patient groups. fMRI atypical-language patterns can be separated by qualitative visual inspection or by means of Laterality Indices (LI) based on region of interest. LI is a coefficient related to the asymmetry of distribution of activated voxels with respect to the midline and it lacks specific spatial and graphical information. We describe a mathematical and computational method for the automatic discrimination of variant spatial patterns of fMRI activation in a mixed population of control subjects and LRE patients. Unique in this study is the provision of a data-driven mechanism to automatically extract brain activation patterns from a heterogeneous population. This method will lead to automatic self-clustering of the datasets provided by different institutions often with different acquisition parameters.

Predicting survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest: role of the Utstein data elements. Survival after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest depends on the links in the chain of survival. The Utstein elements are designed to assess these links and provide the basis for comparing outcomes within and across communities. We assess whether these measures sufficiently predict survival and explain outcome differences. We used an observational, prospective data collection, case-series of adult persons with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest from December 1, 2005, through March 1, 2007, from the multisite, population-based Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium Epistry-Cardiac Arrest. We used logistic regression, receiver operating curves, and measures of variance to estimate the extent to which the Utstein elements predicted survival to hospital discharge and explained outcome variability overall and between 7 Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium sites. Analyses were conducted for all emergency medical services-treated cardiac arrests and for the subset of bystander-witnessed patient arrests because of presumed cardiac cause presenting with ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Survival was 7.8% overall (n=833/10,681) and varied from 4.6% to 14.7% across Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium sites. Among bystander-witnessed ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia, survival was 22.1% overall (n=323/1459) and varied from 12.5% to 41.0% across sites. The Utstein elements collectively predicted 72% of survival variability among all arrests and 40% of survival variability among bystander-witnessed ventricular fibrillation. The Utstein elements accounted for 43.6% of the between-site survival difference among all arrests and 22.3% of the between-site difference among the bystander-witnessed ventricular fibrillation subset. The Utstein elements predict survival but account for only a modest portion of outcome variability overall and between Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium sites. The results underscore the need for ongoing investigation to better understand characteristics that influence cardiac arrest survival.

Differential effect of hot water treatment on whole tubers versus cut setts of yam (Dioscorea spp.). The use of thermotherapy or hot water treatment (HWT) is recommended for the management of plant-parasitic nematodes and other pathogens for a range of planting material, especially vegetatively propagated crops including yams, Dioscorea spp. The sprouting (germination) and consequent viability of yam following HWT, however, appear to be influenced by the post-treatment method of planting (whole or cut setts) and cultivar. The present study was established to evaluate the sensitivity of the most popular yam cultivars in Benin and Nigeria, West Africa, to HWT at 50-53 degrees C for 20 min. Sprouting of both setts and whole tubers of most cultivars was affected by HWT. Across experiments, 47% of HWT material, compared with 61% of non-HWT material, sprouted over 8 weeks. When cut into setts, 41% of HWT or untreated tubers sprouted, compared with 72% of whole tubers. Whole, untreated tubers had highest sprouting rates (84%), and setts following HWT had the lowest (38%). Yam planting material was also not completely free of parasitic nematodes following HWT. The reaction to HWT or cutting was highly cultivar specific. Yam cultivars vary in their sensitivity to hot water therapy. Care is therefore advised in selecting yam cultivars for HWT, especially when using cut setts.

Excellent fluoride decontamination and antibacterial efficacy of Fe-Ca-Zr hybrid metal oxide nanomaterial. The aim of the present study is to develop an efficient nanomaterial for the removal of fluoride and disinfection of harmful bacteria in order to make water potable according to Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) guidelines. Hydrous hybrid Fe-Ca-Zr oxide nanoadsorbent presented a marked fluoride adsorption capacity of 250 mg/g at pH 7.0 (Â±0.1) much greater than other commercially accessible adsorbents for both synthetic and real water samples. The adsorption isotherms, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) fitted reasonably well fine having high coefficient of regression values. The adsorption of fluoride was established well using pseudo-second-order kinetics. The fluoride loaded adsorbent was efficiently regenerated by using an alkali solution. Interestingly, the developed nanomaterial not only showed excellent fluoride removal capacity but also demonstrated good antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli with IC50 (25 Î¼g/mL).

Integrins, especially Î±(v)Î²(3) and Î±(v)Î²(5), are upregulated in tumor cells and activated endothelial cells and as such, serve as cancer biomarkers. We developed a novel near-infrared-labeled optical agent for the in vivo detection and quantification of Î±(v)Î²(3)/Î±(v)Î²(5). A small peptidomimetic Î±(v)Î²(3) antagonist was synthesized, coupled to a near-infrared fluorescent (NIRF) dye, and tested for binding specificity using integrin-overexpressing cells, inhibition of vitronectin-mediated cell attachment, binding to tumor and endothelial cells in vitro, and competition studies. Pharmacokinetics, biodistribution, specificity of tumor targeting, and the effect of an antiangiogenic treatment were assessed in vivo. The integrin NIRF agent showed strong selectivity towards Î±(v)Î²(3/)Î±(v)Î²(5) in vitro and predominant tumor distribution in vivo, allowing noninvasive and real-time quantification of integrin signal in tumors. Antiangiogenic treatment significantly inhibited integrin signal in vivo but had no effect on a cathepsin-cleavable NIR agent. Simultaneous imaging revealed different patterns of distribution reflecting the underlying differences in integrin and cathepsin biology during tumor progression. NIRF-labeled integrin antagonists allow noninvasive molecular fluorescent imaging and quantification of tumors in vivo, improving and providing more refined approaches for cancer detection and treatment monitoring.

Towards control of Streptococcus iniae. Streptococcus iniae is an emerging zoonotic pathogen; such infections generally occur through injuries associated with preparing whole fresh fish for cooking. Those infected to date have been of Asian descent, are usually elderly (average age 68 years), and have had >/=1 underlying conditions that may predispose them to infection. Studies of the foundations of growth characteristics of S. iniae and its interactions with piscine host cells have recently been complemented by molecular studies. Advances in molecular biology have allowed research groups to identify numerous virulence factors and to explore their roles in the progression of S. iniae infection. Many of these virulence factors are homologous to those found in the major human pathogen S. pyogenes. An increased understanding of the properties of these factors and their effect on the success of infection is leading to novel approaches to control S. iniae infection; in particular, vaccination programs at fish farms have reduced the reservoir of infection for additional clinical cases.


[Chronic blepharitis: which role for Demodex folliculorum? A case report].

Local electrical stimulation of single adherent cells using three-dimensional electrode arrays with small interelectrode distances. In this paper, we describe the localized and selective electrical stimulation of single cells using a three-dimensional electrode array. The chip consisted of 84 nail-like electrodes with a stimulation surface of 0.8 microm(2) and interelectrode distances as small as 3 microm. N2A cells were used to compare bipolar stimulation between one electrode in- and one outside the cell on the one hand, and two electrodes in the same cell on the other hand. Selective and localized stimulation of primary embryonic cardiomyocytes showed the possibility to use this chip with excitable cells. The response of the cells to applied electrical fields was monitored using calcium imaging whereas assessment of electroporation was determined following influx of propidium iodide. Arrays of these three-dimensional electrodes could eventually be used as a tool to selectively electroporate the membrane of single cells for genetic manipulation or to obtain electrical access to the inner compartment of the cell.

Population dynamics of PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and their targets in Drosophila.

Impact of age, sex, physical function, health-related quality of life, and treatment with adalimumab on work status and work productivity of patients with ankylosing spondylitis. To determine factors associated with work in patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS). Three hundred fifteen patients with AS were enrolled in a 24-week, randomized controlled study of adalimumab with a longterm, open-label, adalimumab extension phase. Patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures included the Medical Outcome Study Short Form 36 Health Survey (SF-36), AS Quality of Life Questionnaire (ASQOL), Health Utilities Index Mark 3 (HUI-3), and Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Specific Health Problem Questionnaire (WPAI-SHP). Multivariate logistic regression was used to analyze differences between working and nonworking patients. The relationships between PRO and WPAI-SHP scores were assessed using Pearson correlation coefficients. Multivariate modeling was applied to determine factors associated with productivity while at work. WPAI-SHP was assessed through 3 years of adalimumab exposure. Younger age (p = 0.002) and male sex (p < 0.001) were significantly and independently associated with working patients with AS. The SF-36 Physical Component Summary score (p < 0.001), ASQOL score (p < 0.001), HUI-3 scores (p < 0.001), and both patient's global assessment of disease activity (p < 0.001) and nocturnal pain (p < 0.001) scores were independently associated with working status. Work absenteeism due to AS was weakly correlated with all PRO scores. WPAI-SHP components of work presenteeism (lack of productivity at work), activity impairment, and overall work productivity loss due to AS were moderately correlated with quality of life as measured by the ASQOL, the SF-36 Physical Component Summary score, and the SF-36 Bodily Pain domain. Linear multivariate analyses indicated that work presenteeism was significantly associated with pain, functioning, and disease activity. Longterm adalimumab treatment was associated with sustained improvements in WPAI-SHP scores. Quality of life and the physical consequences associated with AS have a direct relationship with a patient's ability to work. Adalimumab sustains improvements in work outcomes in patients with AS.


Screening of genes encoding adhesion factors and biofilm formation in Staphylococcus aureus isolates from poultry.

Automated discrimination method for measuring the thickness of muscular and subcutaneous fat layers based on tissue elasticity. The balance between human body composition, e.g. bones, muscles, and fat, is a major and basic indicator of personal health. This paper proposes a new discrimination method for measuring the thickness of subcutaneous fat and muscular layers based on tissue elasticity. The validity of the proposed method was evaluated in twenty-one subjects (twelve women, ten men; aged 20-70 yr) at three anatomical sites. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve considerably high discrimination performance.


Conduction analysis in mixed cardiomyocytes-fibroblasts cultures using microelectrode arrays.

A computer study of the effects of branching dimension on safety factor distribution and propagation in a cardiac conduction network. Branching conduction networks are responsible for coordinated distribution of activation throughout the heart, but the effects of branching geometry on the efficiency of distribution and the safety of propagation remain unclear. We have developed a simplified computer model to investigate this issue in a systemic fashion. A simplified 2D model that reproduces key features of the right atrial pectinate muscle network has been developed. This consists of a large main strand that gives rise to regularly spaced perpendicular branches. Safety factor (SF) and activation time (AT) within the network are estimated for a range of different branch dimensions. The SF is reduced as branch dimension is increased due to the larger current load and is least at the proximal edge of the junction between the main strand and branches. On the other hand, activation efficiency depends on appropriate balance between the load imposed by branching and source which they subsequently provide. With repeated stimulation at progressively decreasing coupling intervals, the SF and conduction fall within the network, but the locations of block varied with branching dimension, again reflecting spatial variation in the balance between current source and current load. We hypothesize that the observed geometry of the branching network optimizes distribution efficiency and propagation safety.

Postoperative nomogram for invasive bladder cancer: does it really work? A multicenter cohort study. Nomograms are statistical models designed to maximize predictive accuracy. We have tested the statistical correlation between the predictions of International Bladder Cancer Nomogram Consortium and the clinical outcomes in a multicenter Italian cohort of patients treated with radical cystectomy (RC) and pelvic lymph-nodes dissection. Two hundred four patients who underwent RC were selected for multiple variable and then enrolled in the study. Patients were tested by the "online tool" based on the nomogram, then stratified and risk grouped for 5-year predicted disease-free survival (pDFS): low risk (67%-100%), intermediate risk (34%-66%), and high risk group (0%-33%). Receiving operating characteristic curve (ROC) quantified the area under curve (AUC) as predictive accuracy. Actual overall survival (aOS) and actual disease-free survival (aDFS) were calculated with Kaplan-Meyer analysis. Median of pDFS was compared with 5-year aDFS. AUC was 0.69 (P < 0.001). The aOS is 50% (95% confidence interval (95% CI, -7.68/+8.23) at 5-years after RC, the aDFS is 65.5% (95% CI, -7.56/+8.98). The 5-year aDFS is 75.3% (-8.82/+12.53) in low risk group; 67.3% (-12/+16.4) in intermediate risk group; 28.3% (-20/+17.2) in high risk group. The 5-year aDFS was well calculated by the nomogram but in all groups the nomogram slightly underestimated the prediction. In intermediate risk group, 5-year aDFS overscored both the nomogram pDFS and the pDFS range of this group (34%-66%). In all patients investigated, the pDFS was 65%, a value close to the 5-year aDFS found (65.6%). Statistical correlation between postoperative nomogram prediction and the clinical reality was observed.

Vaccination against the influenza virus and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases in the city of Sao Paulo. The effect of vaccination against the influenza virus on the mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remains controversial. To analyze the mortality by CVD before and after the start of the vaccination against the Influenza virus in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. We analyzed the mortality due to ischemic heart diseases (IHD), cerebrovascular diseases (CbVD) and external causes (EC) in the population of the metropolitan region of the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, aged > or = 60 years, before and after the start of the vaccination program against Influenza. The population estimates and mortality data were obtained, respectively, from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE; www.ibge.gov.br) and from the Brazilian Ministry of Health (www.datasus.gov.br) for the period between 1980 and 2006. The risk of death was adjusted by the direct method, using the 1960 world standard population. The comparisons between the inclinations of the regression lines were similar for CbVD (p = 0.931) and EC (p = 0.941); however, for IHD (p = 0.022), a significant decrease was observed in the regression line of the post-vaccination period, when compared to the pre-vaccination period. A change in the tendency towards mortality after 1996 was significant only for the IHD (p = 0.022), remaining unaltered for the CbVD (p = 0.931) and EC (p = 0.941). The vaccination against the Influenza virus was associated with a significant decrease in the mortality due to IHD.

Impact of rurality on maternal and infant health indicators and outcomes in Maine. Rural residents may face health challenges related to geographic barriers to care, physician shortages, poverty, lower educational attainment, and other demographic factors. In maternal and child health, these disparities may be evidenced by the health risks and behaviors of new mothers, the health of infants born to these mothers, and the care received by both mothers and infants. To determine the impact of rurality on maternal and child health in Maine, USA, 11 years of data (2000-2010) for the state of Maine from the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) project were analyzed. PRAMS is a national public health surveillance system that uses questionnaires to survey women who had delivered live infants in the previous 2-4 months. Using a geographic information system, each questionnaire response was assigned a rurality tier (urban, suburban, large rural town, or isolated rural community) based on the rural-urban commuting area code of the town of residence of the mother. Results from the four rurality tiers were compared using the survey procedures in Statistical Analysis Software to adjust for the complex sampling strategy of the PRAMS dataset. Means (for continuous variables) and percentages (for categorical variables) were calculated for each rurality tier, along with 95% confidence intervals. Significant differences between rurality tiers were tested for using F-tests or Ï2 tests. If significant differences between rurality tiers existed (p<0.05), specific tiers were judged to be different from each other if their 95% confidence intervals did not overlap. A total of 12 600 mothers responded to the PRAMS questionnaire during the study period. Compared to mothers from more urban areas, rural mothers were younger (10.5% of mothers from isolated rural areas were teenagers compared to 6.2% of mothers from urban areas), less well educated, less likely to be married, and more likely to live in lower income households (39.6% of isolated rural mothers had household incomes â¤US$20 000/year vs 28.8% of urban mothers). Rural mothers had higher pre-pregnancy body mass indexes (BMIs; average BMI 26.1 for isolated rural women vs 25.3 for urban women) and were more likely to smoke but less likely to drink alcohol (both before and during pregnancy). Compared to mothers from more urban areas, rural mothers were not sure they were pregnant until a later gestational age but received prenatal care just as early and were just as likely to receive prenatal care as early as they wished. There were no differences among rurality tiers in Caesarean section rates, rates of premature births (<37 weeks gestation), or rates of underweight births (<2500 g). However infants born to rural mothers were less likely to be breastfed (52.9% of isolated rural vs 60.9% of urban infants breast fed for â¥8 weeks). These results show that, while rural women face significant demographic and behavior challenges, their access to prenatal care, the care they receive while pregnant, and the outcomes of their pregnancies are similar to those of urban women. These results highlight areas where focused pre-pregnancy and prenatal education may improve maternal and child health in rural Maine.


HLA-C cell surface expression and control of HIV/AIDS correlate with a variant upstream of HLA-C.

Identification of natural pneumococcal isolates expressing serotype 6D by genetic, biochemical and serological characterization. The recently discovered pneumococcal serotype 6C was created when the original wciN gene in the 6A capsule gene locus was naturally replaced with a new gene. Since the capsule gene loci of 6A and 6B serotypes may differ by only one base pair in the wciP gene, it was speculated that a new serotype '6D' would be possible if the new wciN gene were inserted into the 6B capsule gene locus. Although pneumococci expressing serotype 6D could be produced in the laboratory, initial searches for natural pneumococcal isolates expressing serotype 6D were unsuccessful. However, we now report the discovery of two naturally occurring pneumococcal isolates from Korea that have the serological, genetic and biochemical features predicted for serotype 6D.

Quantitative estimation of muscle fatigue using surface electromyography during static muscle contraction. Muscle fatigue is commonly associated with the musculoskeletal disorder problem. Previously, various techniques were proposed to index the muscle fatigue from electromyography signal. However, quantitative measurement is still difficult to achieve. This study aimed at proposing a method to estimate the degree of muscle fatigue quantitatively. A fatigue model was first constructed using handgrip dynamometer by conducting a series of static contraction tasks. Then the degree muscle fatigue can be estimated from electromyography signal with reasonable accuracy. The error of the estimated muscle fatigue was less than 10% MVC and no significant difference was found between the estimated value and the one measured using force sensor. Although the results were promising, there were still some limitations that need to be overcome in future study.

[Carbon and energetic metabolism of Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 under photoautotrophic conditions]. Metabolic flux analysis is a very powerful tool to understand CO2 fixation and light energy utilization of microalgae during photoautotrophic cultivation. A comprehensive network structure for the autotrophic growth of Synechococcus sp. PCC7942 was proposed, and the carbon and energetic metabolism under different incident light intensity was investigated based on metabolic flux analysis in this paper. These results showed that CO2 fixation was the main energy and reducing potential trap which accounted for 85% and 70% of the total energy and reducing potential consumption respectively. We also found that the cell yield and the maximum cell yield based on ATP synthesis were maintained 2.80 g/mol and 2.97 g/mol respectively under the appointed incident intensity. But the cell yield on absorbed light energy their corresponding energy conversion efficiency were descended with the increasing of incident intensity.

Metabolic and chemical origins of cross-reactive immunological reactions to arylamine benzenesulfonamides: T-cell responses to hydroxylamine and nitroso derivatives. Exposure to sulfamethoxazole (SMX) is associated with T-cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions in human patients. T-cells can be stimulated by the putative metabolite nitroso SMX, which binds irreversibly to protein. The hydroxylamine and nitroso derivatives of three arylamine benzenesulfonamides, namely, sulfamethozaxole, sulfadiazine, and sulfapyridine, were synthesized, and their T-cell stimulatory capacity in the mouse was explored. Nitroso derivatives were synthesized by a three-step procedure involving the formation of nitro and hydroxylamine sulfonamide intermediates. For immune activation, female Balb-c strain mice were administered nitroso sulfonamides four times weekly for 2 weeks. After 14 days, isolated splenocytes were incubated with the parent compounds, hydroxylamine metabolites, and nitroso derivatives to measure antigen-specific proliferation. To explore the requirement of irreversible protein binding for spleen cell activation, splenocytes were incubated with nitroso derivatives in the presence or absence of glutathione. Splenocytes from nitroso sulfonamide-sensitized mice proliferated and secreted interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, and granulocyte monocyte colony-stimulating factor following stimulation with nitroso derivatives but not the parent compounds. Splenocytes from sensitized mice were also stimulated to proliferate with hydroxylamine and nitroso derivatives of the structurally related sulfonamides. The addition of glutathione inhibited the nitroso-specific T-cell response. Hydroxylamine metabolites were unstable in aqueous solution: Spontaneous transformation yielded appreciable amounts of nitroso and azoxy compounds as well as the parent compounds within 0.1 h. T-cell cross-reactivity with nitroso sulfonamides provides a mechanistic explanation as to why structurally related arylamine benzenesulfonamides are contraindicated in hypersensitive patients.

Dose-rounding of adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer: an audit of toxicity. dose-rounding of chemotherapy is increasingly being used in oncology departments to improve the efficiency of outpatient clinics. There is, however, no published data on the effect of this strategy on drug toxicity. we have analysed acute chemotherapy side effects in a cohort of 662 consecutive patients receiving adjuvant FEC (5-fluorouracil, epirubicin, cyclophosphamide) for breast cancer. A dose-rounding algorithm was used to deliver drug doses that were within 5% of the standard dose based on body surface area. patients receiving a rounded dose of chemotherapy that was higher than that calculated from their body surface area were not at increased risk of acute haematological or non-haematological toxicity. dose-rounding of adjuvant FEC within the range Â± 5% is not associated with any difference in acute chemotherapy side effects. Longer term follow-up is required to determine whether patients receiving rounded doses below that calculated from their body surface area are at increased risk of relapse.

Comparison between logopedic and MRI findings in evaluating tongue function. The logopedic examination according to Kittel (1998) is a method frequently used to diagnose tongue dysfunction. There has been a lack of reliable parameters to confirm this analysis. MR images visualize resting position and tongue movement as well as surrounding structures relevant to oral function. The aim of this study was to compare logopedic and MRI findings in evaluating tongue function and to assess whether MRI findings can replace logopedic examination for diagnostic purposes. 56 subjects were examined by the following methods: - Logopedic examination according to Kittel (1998) - MR images of the tongue resting position (T1-weighted) and deglutition process (2D-FIESTA technique) - MRI analysis according to Fujiki et al. (2000) We observed marked differences between the logopedic and MRI findings, yet there were no significant correlations between the logopedic outcome and distances measured via MRI in tongue resting position and swallowing patterns. We noted little concordance between logopedic findings according to Kittel and MRI analysis according to Fujiki et al. Which of these findings correctly reflects the actual clinical situation remains unclear.

Time Course for Onset and Recovery from Effects of a Novel Male Reproductive Toxicant: Implications for Apical Preclinical Study Designs. In the pharmaceutic ICH S5(R2) guidelines for reproductive toxicity testing, a premating dose duration of 14 days is considered sufficient for assessment of male fertility for compounds that are not testicular toxicants. A novel Î±7 subtype of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (Î±7nAChR) agonist, originally intended for treatment of Alzheimer's disease, did not cause changes in sperm counts, motility, or testicular histopathology in rat toxicity studies of up to 6 months duration. However, profound decrements in male fertility (reduced pregnancy rates and litter sizes) occurred after 11 weeks of dosing in male rats. In two time-course investigations, dosed male rats were paired with undosed females after 5, 14, and 28 daily doses and again after 2 and 4 weeks off-dose. Effects on male fertility were undetectable after 5 days. After 14 days, there was no effect on pregnancy rate, but preimplantation losses were increased. Effects on both pregnancy rates and preimplantation losses were clearly detectable after 28 days, but were of lesser magnitude than after 11 weeks of dosing. Fertility recovered rapidly after dose cessation. These studies illustrate the sensitivity of a long premating dose period at revealing hazard and determining the magnitude of effect on male fertility for compounds that are intended for chronic administration and do not affect testicular histopathology.

Symmetrical Curvilinear Cytotoxic Edema Along the Surface of the Brain Stem: A Probable New Magnetic Resonance Imaging Finding of Leptomeningeal Carcinomatosis. Lung cancer is one of the most common neoplasms to appear leptomeningeal metastasis (LM). Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is better diagnostic choice for LM and usually shows focal nodular or diffuse linear enhancement on the leptomeninges along the sulci and tentorium in the brain. We experienced atypical 2 cases of lung cancer in patients who showed unusual brain MRI finding of symmetrical curvilinear or band-like, nonenhancing cytotoxic edema along the surface of the brain stem. This finding is unique and different from the general findings of leptomeningeal metastasis. This unique imaging finding of symmetric curvilinear nonenhancing cytotoxic edema along the brainstem is extremely rare and represents a new presentation of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis.

The effects of treadmill exercise training on hip bone density and tibial bone geometry in stroke survivors: a pilot study. Individuals with stroke often sustain bone loss on the hemiparetic side and are prone to fragility fractures. Exercise training may be a viable way to promote bone mineral density (BMD) and geometry in this population. This was a pilot study to evaluate the effects of a 6-month treadmill exercise program on hip BMD and tibial bone geometry in chronic stroke survivors. Twenty-one individuals with chronic stroke, with a mean age of 64.5 years and mean post-stroke duration of 8.3 years participated in the study. The treatment group underwent a treadmill gait exercise program (two 1-hour sessions per week for 6 months), whereas the control group participated in their usual self-selected activities in the community. The primary outcomes were hip BMD and bone geometry of the midshaft tibia on the paretic side, whereas the secondary outcomes were gait velocity, endurance, leg muscle strength, balance self-efficacy, and physical activity level. Mann-Whitney U tests were used to compare the change in all outcome variables between the 2 groups after treatment. Significant between-group differences in change scores of tibial cortical thickness (P = .016), endurance ( P = .029), leg muscle strength on the paretic side (P < .001) and non-paretic side (P < .001), balance self-efficacy (P = .016), and physical activity level (P = .023) were found. The treadmill exercise program induced a modest improvement in tibial bone geometry in individuals with chronic stroke. Further studies are required to explore the optimal training protocol for promoting favorable changes in bone parameters following stroke.

Relationship between pseudoexfoliation syndrome and erectile dysfunction: a possible cause of endothelial dysfunction for development of erectile dysfunction. Pseudoexfoliation syndrome (PES) is a common age-related fibrillopathy related to accumulation of pseudoexfoliation material (PEM) in certain places in the body, especially blood vessels. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is another condition related to vascular pathology and in this study it is aimed to identify the relationship between ED and PES. Data of 92 patients were investigated. There were 34 patients in the PES group and 58 patients in the control group. Presence of diabetes, hypertension, smoking history, BMI, and serum levels of lipids and testosterone were recorded. The groups were compared for ED rates and severity. Also logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for development of ED. Mean age of the population was 67.3. No significant difference was observed between the two groups regarding the presece of DM, HT, smoking, BMI and laboratory measurements. ED rate was significantly higher in the PES group (70.6% vs 48.3%, p=0.002). Also, severe ED rate was higher in the PES group (p=0.002). PES was detected as an independent risk factors for the development of ED. ED is a possible consequence of PES. ED rate and severity is found to be higher in the PES group and PES is detected as an independent risk factor for development of ED. Patients with PES should be informed about development of ED and further prospective trials with objective measurements of penile blood flow should be conducted to verify the erectile status and penile blood flow in PES patients.


Heterogeneous prevalence of recurrent BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Spain according to the geographical area: implications for genetic testing.

Comparison of low-energy versus high-energy biphasic defibrillation shocks following prolonged ventricular fibrillation. Since the initial development of the defibrillator, there has been concern that, while delivery of a large electric shock would stop fibrillation, it would also cause damage to the heart. This concern has been raised again with the development of the biphasic defibrillator. To compare defibrillation efficacy, postshock cardiac function, and troponin I levels following 150-J and 360-J shocks. Nineteen swine were anesthetized with isoflurane and instrumented with pressure catheters in the left ventricle, aorta, and right atrium. The animals were fibrillated for 6 minutes, followed by defibrillation with either low-energy (n = 8) or high-energy (n = 11) shocks. After defibrillation, chest compressions were initiated and continued until return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Epinephrine, 0.01 mg/kg every 3 minutes, was given for arterial blood pressure < 50 mmHg. Hemodynamic parameters were recorded for four hours. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed and troponin I levels were measured at baseline and four hours following ventricular fibrillation (VF). Survival rates at four hours were not different between the two groups (low-energy, 5 of 8; high-energy, 7 of 11). Results for arterial blood pressure, positive dP/dt (first derivative of pressure measured over time, a measure of left ventricular contractility), and negative dP/dt at the time of lowest arterial blood pressure (ABP) following ROSC were not different between the two groups (p = not significant [NS]), but were lower than at baseline. All hemodynamic measures returned to baseline by four hours. Ejection fractions, stroke volumes, and cardiac outputs were not different between the two groups at four hours. Troponin I levels at four hours were not different between the two groups (12 +/- 11 ng/mL versus 21 +/- 26 ng/mL, p = NS) but were higher at four hours than at baseline (19 +/- 19 ng/mL versus 0.8 +/- 0.5 ng/mL, p < 0.05, groups combined). Biphasic 360-J shocks do not cause more cardiac damage than biphasic 150-J shocks in this animal model of prolonged VF and resuscitation.

Pretreatment risk factors for parametrial involvement in FIGO stage IB1 cervical cancer. All patients with stage IB1 cervical cancer do not need to undergo parametrectomy. Some low-risk criteria for parametrial involvement (PI) have been proposed based on pathological findings. The aim of this study was to determine pretreatment risk factors for PI in stage IB1 cervical cancer. We retrospectively reviewed 115 patients with stage IB1 cervical cancer who underwent radical hysterectomy or radical trachelectomy. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed and serum concentrations of squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) and cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) were determined in all patients before initial treatment. The following pretreatment factors were investigated: histological variant, maximum tumor diameter, tumor volume (volume index), pelvic lymph node enlargement, and serum tumor markers. Logistic regression analysis was used to select the independent risk factors for PI. Eighteen of the 115 patients (15.7%) were pathologically diagnosed with PI. Multivariate analysis confirmed the following independent risk factors for PI: MRI-based tumor diameter â¥ 25 mm (odds ratio [OR], 9.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.1 to 48.1), MRI-based volume index â¥ 5,000 mmÂ³ (OR, 13.3; 95% CI, 1.4 to 125.0), and positive serum tumor markers SCC-Ag â¥ 1.5 ng/mL or CA-125 â¥ 35 U/mL (OR, 5.7; 95% CI, 1.3 to 25.1). Of 53 patients with no risk factors for PI, none had PI. Less radical surgery may become one of the treatment options for stage IB1 cervical cancer patients with MRI-based tumor diameter <25 mm, MRI-based volume index <5,000 mmÂ³, and negativity for SCC-Ag and CA-125.

Behavioral and neural Darwinism: selectionist function and mechanism in adaptive behavior dynamics. An evolutionary theory of behavior dynamics and a theory of neuronal group selection share a common selectionist framework. The theory of behavior dynamics instantiates abstractly the idea that behavior is selected by its consequences. It implements Darwinian principles of selection, reproduction, and mutation to generate adaptive behavior in virtual organisms. The behavior generated by the theory has been shown to be quantitatively indistinguishable from that of live organisms. The theory of neuronal group selection suggests a mechanism whereby the abstract principles of the evolutionary theory may be implemented in the nervous systems of biological organisms. According to this theory, groups of neurons subserving behavior may be selected by synaptic modifications that occur when the consequences of behavior activate value systems in the brain. Together, these theories constitute a framework for a comprehensive account of adaptive behavior that extends from brain function to the behavior of whole organisms in quantitative detail.

Phase II trial of oral topotecan and intravenous carboplatin with G-CSF support in previously untreated patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer: A North Central Cancer Treatment Group Study.

Rapid, enhanced, and persistent protection of patients with renal insufficiency by AS02(V)-adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine. The adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine, HB-AS04, elicits more rapid and persistent protective antibody concentrations than double doses of conventional recombinant vaccines in patients with renal insufficiency. We compared the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and safety of the AS02(V)-adjuvanted hepatitis B vaccine HB-AS02 with that of HB-AS04. In this phase III, open, randomized study, 151 hepatitis B vaccine-naÃ¯ve pre-dialysis, peritoneal dialysis, and hemodialysis patients aged 15 years and older received three doses of HB-AS02 at 0, 1, and 6 months. Another 149 similar patients received four doses of HB-AS04 at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months, and all were followed up for 12 months. HB-AS02 elicited more rapid and persistent seroprotection than HB-AS04, with rates of 77 and 39%, respectively, 1 month after the second vaccine dose, and 94 and 79%, respectively, at 12 months. Superiority of HB-AS02 over HB-AS04 in anti-hepatitis B geometric mean concentrations was found at all time points. HB-AS02 was more reactogenic than HB-AS04, but adverse events were mainly transient, of mild to moderate intensity with no reportable vaccine-related serious events. We conclude that a three-dose primary course of HB-AS02 induced more rapid, enhanced, and persistent protection in patients with renal insufficiency than the licensed four-dose primary schedule of HB-AS04. This adjuvanted vaccine affords greater protection with reduced need for booster doses in patients at high risk of hepatitis B infection.

Proximal row carpectomy with capsular interposition arthroplasty for advanced arthritis of the wrist. Advanced osteoarthritis of the wrist or the distal articulation of the lunate with the capitate has traditionally been treated surgically by arthrodesis. In order to maintain movement, we performed proximal row carpectomy with capsular interposition arthroplasty as an alternative to arthrodesis in eight patients with advanced arthritis and retrospectively reviewed their clinical and radiographic outcomes after a mean follow-up of 41 months (13 to 53). The visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain at its worst and at rest, and the patient-rated wrist evaluation score improved significantly after surgery, whereas ranges of movement and grip strength were maintained at the pre-operative levels. Progression of arthritis in the radiocapitate joint was observed in three patients, but their outcomes were not significantly different from those without progression of arthritis. Proximal row carpectomy with capsular interposition arthroplasty is a reasonable option for the treatment of patients with advanced arthritis of the wrist.

Personality, perceived luck and gambling attitudes as predictors of gambling involvement. A quantitative observational study was undertaken to examine the relationship between individual factors and level of gambling involvement, in particular problem gambling (PG). The specific factors under study were personality, perceived luck, and attitudes towards gambling. A sample of university students (N = 185) completed a battery of questionnaires, consisting of the 16PF, Canadian Problem Gambling Index, Belief in Good Luck Scale (BIGL), Gambling Attitudes Scale (GAS), and the Impulsive Non-Conformity subscale (ImpNon) from the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences. Four groups were formed (Non-PG, Low-Risk, Moderate-Risk, and PG). Personality profiles varied between groups, and there were significant main effects and interaction effects on gender and personality factors. The PG group was higher on impulsivity, and belief in luck, and had more positive attitudes towards gambling. Multiple Regression Analysis and Discriminant Functions Analysis, using variables including some 16PF factors, BIGL and GAS variables, produced models that were highly predictive of gambling severity and gambling membership. In both models, impulsivity was the strongest predictor. These results were discussed in terms of their implications for future research and treatment of PG.

Inhibition of acute pulmonary and systemic inflammation by 1,7-dimethylxanthine. The nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerse-1 (PARP-1) has previously been reported to play an important role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pulmonary inflammation and is highly activated in COPD patients. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory efficacy of a previously identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) inhibiting caffeine metabolite, 1,7-dimethylxanthine, was both in vivo as well as ex vivo evaluated. Orally administered 1,7-dimethylxanthine significantly attenuated lung myeloperoxidase-levels, transcription of IL-6, TNF-alpha, MIP1alpha and MIP2 genes as well as PAR-polymer formation in a mouse model of intratracheally LPS-induced acute pulmonary inflammation. Serum amyloid P component and plasma IL-6 were also lowered in 1,7-dimethylxanthine treated mice, indicating a reduced systemic inflammatory response. In addition, at 24h after LPS administration anti-inflammatory effects of 1,7-dimethylxanthine appeared more pronounced than those of the orally administered PARP-1 inhibitor 3-aminobenzamide. In the second model, in blood of COPD-patients and healthy controls ex vivo pre-incubated with a physiological concentration of 1,7-dimethylxanthine (10microM), LPS-induced production of the cytokines IL-6 and TNF-alpha was significantly suppressed. 1,7-Dimethylxanthine exerts anti-inflammatory effects, both in vivo mouse as well as ex vivo human. These results suggest that the PARP-1 inhibiting caffeine metabolite 1,7-dimethylxanthine may have therapeutic potential in pulmonary inflammatory diseases such as COPD.

Identification of Patient Benefit From Proton Therapy for Advanced Head and Neck Cancer Patients Based on Individual and Subgroup Normal Tissue Complication Probability Analysis. The purpose of this study was to determine, by treatment plan comparison along with normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) modeling, whether a subpopulation of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) could be identified that would gain substantial benefit from proton therapy in terms of NTCP. For 45 HNSCC patients, intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) was compared to intensity modulated proton therapy (IMPT). Physical dose distributions were evaluated as well as the resulting NTCP values, using modern models for acute mucositis, xerostomia, aspiration, dysphagia, laryngeal edema, and trismus. Patient subgroups were defined based on primary tumor location. Generally, IMPT reduced the NTCP values while keeping similar target coverage for all patients. Subgroup analyses revealed a higher individual reduction of swallowing-related side effects by IMPT for patients with tumors in the upper head and neck area, whereas the risk reduction of acute mucositis was more pronounced in patients with tumors in the larynx region. More patients with tumors in the upper head and neck area had a reduction in NTCP of more than 10%. Subgrouping can help to identify patients who may benefit more than others from the use of IMPT and, thus, can be a useful tool for a preselection of patients in the clinic where there are limited PT resources. Because the individual benefit differs within a subgroup, the relative merits should additionally be evaluated by individual treatment plan comparisons.

Selective attention for masked and unmasked threatening words in anxiety: Effects of trait anxiety, state anxiety and awareness. We investigated the effects of awareness on selective attention for masked and unmasked verbal threat material using a computerised version of the emotional Stroop. Participants were assigned to the high trait anxious (HTA) and low trait anxious (LTA) groups on the basis of questionnaire scores, and state anxiety was manipulated within participants through the threat of electric shock. To investigate the effects of awareness on responses to threat, the mode of exposure was blocked such that half the participants received masked trials before the unmasked trials, whereas the other half received the reverse order. The results revealed that there was no difference between the HTA and LTA groups in responses to threat for those who received the masked trials before the unmasked trials. However, when unmasked trials were presented before the masked trials HTA individuals were significantly slower to respond to both masked and unmasked threat words compared to the LTA group, and these effects were not further modified by participants' state anxiety status. The results are discussed in terms of the automatic nature of threat processing in anxiety.

[Regulatory effects of streptococcal protein on the immunologic activity of RAW264.7 murine macrophages.]. To investigate the regulatory effects and the related mechanisms of streptococcal protein on the immunologic activity of RAW264.7 murine macrophages. RAW264.7 cells were incubated with different concentrated streptococcal protein respectively. The proliferation of RAW264.7 cells was determined by MTT assay. The phagocytosis of macrophages was analyzed by neutral red phagocytosis assay. The activities of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in the cultured supernatants were measured by bio-chemical methods. The mRNA expression of TNF-alpha, IL-6 and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in cells was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in peritoneal cells was measured by flow cytometry. Streptococcal protein significantly enhanced the activities of proliferation and phagocytosis of macrophages (P<0.05), induced the release of IL-6, TNF-alpha and the expression of IL-6, TNF-alpha mRNA (P<0.05).The streptococcal protein, meanwhile, also up-regulated the expression of TLR2 and TLR4 in macrophages in vitro (P<0.05). Streptococcal protein may promote proliferation, phagocytosis and cytokines production in regulation of the activity of murine macrophages.

Emerging translational bioinformatics: knowledge-guided biomarker identification for cancer diagnostics. Advances in high-throughput genomic and proteomic technology have led to a growing interest in cancer biomarkers. These biomarkers can potentially improve the accuracy of cancer subtype prediction and subsequently, the success of therapy. In this paper, we describe emerging technology for enabling translational bioinformatics by improving biomarker identification. Specifically, we present an application that uses prior knowledge to identify the most biologically relevant gene ranking algorithm. Identification of statistically and biologically relevant biomarkers from high-throughput data can be unreliable due to the nature of the data--e.g., high technical variability, small sample size, and high dimension size. Furthermore, due to the lack of available training samples, data-driven machine learning methods are often insufficient without the support of knowledge-based algorithms. As a case study, we apply these knowledge-driven methods to renal cancer data and identify genes that are potential biomarkers for cancer subtype classification.


Cyclostreptin and microtubules: is a low-affinity binding site required?

Candida albicans Quorum Sensing Molecules Stimulate Mouse Macrophage Migration. The polymorphic commensal fungus Candida albicans causes life-threatening disease via bloodstream and intra-abdominal infections in immunocompromised and transplant patients. Although host immune evasion is a common strategy used by successful human fungal pathogens, C. albicans provokes recognition by host immune cells less capable of destroying it. To accomplish this, C. albicans white cells secrete a low-molecular-weight chemoattractive stimulant(s) of macrophages, a phagocyte that they are able to survive within and eventually escape from. C. albicans opaque cells do not secrete this chemoattractive stimulant(s). We report here a physiological mechanism that contributes to the differences in the interaction of C. albicans white and opaque cells with macrophages. E,E-Farnesol, which is secreted by white cells only, is a potent stimulator of macrophage chemokinesis, whose activity is enhanced by yeast cell wall components and aromatic alcohols. E,E-farnesol results in up to an 8.5-fold increase in macrophage migration in vitro and promotes a 3-fold increase in the peritoneal infiltration of macrophages in vivo. Therefore, modulation of farnesol secretion to stimulate host immune recognition by macrophages may help explain why this commensal is such a successful pathogen.

Policies to enhance the efficiency of prescribing in the Spanish Catalan region: impact and future direction. To assess the impact of recent national and regional initiatives on the utilization and expenditure of four high-volume classes to provide future guidance. These were proton pump inhibitors, statins and ezetimibe, and renin-angiotensin drugs, as well as newer antidepressants. An observational study of prescriptions dispensed in ambulatory care in Catalonia was conducted from 2003 to 2007. Utilization was converted into defined daily doses (DDDs) and DDDs per 1000 inhabitants per day, and compared over the study period, as well as with other European countries. As expected, there was increasing utilization of statins and renin-angiotensin drugs during the study period, as well as increased utilization of generics versus originators in each class; the latter figures were substantially greater than those published previously. There was also increased utilization of the proton pump inhibitors, which is a cause for concern. There were substantial reductions in the expenditure/DDDs of generics and originator products in 2007 versus 2003. For instance, expenditure/DDDs of generic and originator simvastatin were 81 and 72%, respectively, below 2003 originator prices. These reductions were much greater than those seen in previous publications. The increased utilization of generics, coupled with lower expenditure/DDDs for the classes, led to reduced reimbursed expenditure for the proton pump inhibitors, statins and newer antidepressants over time. The findings are in line with expectations and do provide direction to other European countries, especially those with higher expenditures/DDDs for generics. There is an opportunity for Catalonia to learn from other countries to further enhance the quality and efficiency of its prescribing, and possible initiatives are discussed.


Sex steroids and the thyroid.

Life-threatening arrhythmia caused by primary aldosteronism. Arrhythmias are one of the typical complications of primary aldosteronism (PA), is commonly characterized by hypertension and hypokalemia. In this report, we present 3 cases of subjects in whom primary aldosteronism manifested with life-threatening arrhythmias. In 2 subjects, after excluding organic heart disease, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator was inserted and, only after the second episode of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia accompanied with low plasma potassium levels, the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism was made. It is important to include diagnosis of primary aldosteronism in the diagnostic work-up of hypertensive subjects without any structural cardiovascular impairment who present with malignant arrhythmia and hypokalemia. Appropriate treatment of primary aldosteronism may avoid insertion of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.


Safety of Exposure From Extremely Low Frequency Magnetic Fields During Prenatal Ultrasound Examinations in Clinicians and Pregnant Women.

Multiple functions of Nm23-H1 are regulated by oxido-reduction system. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (NDPK, Nm23), a housekeeping enzyme, is known to be a multifunctional protein, acting as a metastasis suppressor, transactivation activity on c-myc, and regulating endocytosis. The cellular mechanisms regulating Nm23 functions are poorly understood. In this study, we identified the modifications and interacting proteins of Nm23-H1 in response to oxidative stress. We found that Cys109 in Nm23-H1 is oxidized to various oxidation states including intra- and inter-disulfide crosslinks, glutathionylation, and sulfonic acid formation in response to H(2)O(2) treatment both in vivo and in vitro. The cross-linking sites and modifications of oxidized Nm23-H1 were identified by peptide sequencing using UPLC-ESI-q-TOF tandem MS. Glutathionylation and oxidation of Cys109 inhibited the NDPK enzymatic activity of Nm23-H1. We also found that thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) is an interacting protein of Nm23-H1, and it binds specifically to oxidized Nm23-H1. Oxidized Nm23 is a substrate of NADPH-TrxR1-thioredoxin shuttle system, and the disulfide crosslinking is reversibly reduced and the enzymatic activity is recovered by this system. Oxidation of Cys109 in Nm23-H1 inhibited its metastatic suppressor activity as well as the enzymatic activities. The mutant, Nm23-H1 C109A, retained both the enzymatic and metastasis suppressor activities under oxidative stress. This suggests that key enzymatic and metastasis suppressor functions of Nm23-H1 are regulated by oxido-reduction of its Cys109.

Eukaryotic release factor 1-2 affects Arabidopsis responses to glucose and phytohormones during germination and early seedling development. Germination and early seedling development are coordinately regulated by glucose and phytohormones such as ABA, GA, and ethylene. However, the molecules that affect plant responses to glucose and phytohormones remain to be fully elucidated. Eukaryotic release factor 1 (eRF1) is responsible for the recognition of the stop codons in mRNAs during protein synthesis. Accumulating evidence indicates that eRF1 functions in other processes in addition to translation termination. The physiological role of eRF1-2, a member of the eRF1 family, in Arabidopsis was examined here. The eRF1-2 gene was found to be specifically induced by glucose. Arabidopsis plants overexpressing eRF1-2 were hypersensitive to glucose during germination and early seedling development. Such hypersensitivity to glucose was accompanied by a dramatic reduction of the expression of glucose-regulated genes, chlorophyll a/b binding protein and plastocyanin. The hypersensitive response was not due to the enhanced accumulation of ABA. In addition, the eRF1-2 overexpressing plants showed increased sensitivity to paclobutrazol, an inhibitor of GA biosynthesis, and exogenous GA restored their normal growth. By contrast, the loss-of-function erf1-2 mutant exhibited resistance to paclobutrazol, suggesting that eRF1-2 may exert a negative effect on the GA signalling pathway. Collectively, these data provide evidence in support of a novel role of eRF1-2 in affecting glucose and phytohormone responses in modulating plant growth and development.

Metformin-diet ameliorates coronary heart disease risk factors and facilitates resumption of regular menses in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome. In 20 adolescents age < or = 17 (16 +/- 1 yr) with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), we assessed efficacy and safety of metformin-diet for 1 year in treatment of endocrinopathy and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors. Calories were targeted to 1,500-1,800/ day if body mass index (BMI) was < 25 or to 1,200-1,500/day if BMI was > or = 25, along with 2,550 mg metformin. Median weight fell from 85.5 to 78.4 kg (p = 0.004), waist circumference from 91 to 84 cm (p = 0.017), triglyceride from 108 to 71 mg/dl (p = 0.008), insulin from 20.5 to 15 microU/ml (p = 0.018), HOMA-IR from 2.0 to 1.5 (p = 0.026), and testosterone from 45.5 to 31.5 ng/dl (p = 0.03). The percentage of cycles with normal menses rose from a pre-treatment median of 8% to 100%, p < 0.0001. In adolescents (< or = age 17 yr) with PCOS, metformin-diet safely ameliorates CHD risk factors and endocrinopathy while facilitating resumption of regular menses.

[The relationship between inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and complications of urinary and male genital tracts]. Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) that may often involve organs other than those of the gastrointestinal tract. We investigated retrospectively the frequency, diagnosis and treatment of urinary and male genital complications of CD and UC. From February 1998 to July 2007, 93 patients with CD and 75 patients with UC consulted our department for urinary and male genital complications. Thirty, 19 and 16 of the 93 patients with CD were diagnosed as having fistulas to the urinary and male genital systems, urolithiasis and hydronephrosis, respectively. Fifteen, 14 and 13 of the 75 patients with UC were diagnosed as having urolithiasis, urinary tract infection (UTI) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), respectively. Fistula to the urinary and male genital systems in CD occurred more often in men. In 22 CD patients who had undergone surgical operation and were definitively diagnosed as fistula, the positive rate of cystogram (CG) was 38.1% (8/21). They presented with pyuria (10 cases), pneumaturia (7), hematuria (7), fecaluria (2) and urorrhea (2). Cystoscopy was performed in 20 patients. Fistula opening in the urinary bladder was found in only 2 patients. Other findings in the bladder were edema (14 cases), redness of mucosa (6) and debris (3). Hydronephrosis in CD occurred in 16 patients. Placing a percutaneus nephrostomy (PNS) or ureteral stent was performed in 11 patients and surgical therapy was performed in 12 patients. Only two of the 34 patients with urolithiasis (CD 19, UC 15 cases) underwent ESWL and/or TUL. Almost all patients with UTI in UC were treated with antibiotics and improved, but one patient died from Fournier's Gangrene due to erirectal abscess.

The adoption of a new diagnostic technology for tuberculosis in two Brazilian cities from the perspective of patients and healthcare workers: a qualitative study. This article presents the qualitative component linked to a larger study of implementation of the Xpertâ¢ MTB/Rif technology in two Brazilian cities. Despite intrinsic advantages of new health technologies, its introduction can be disruptive to existing routines, and it is thus important to understand how these innovations are perceived by the different groups involved in its regular use. This study was based on semi-structured interviews with patients, lab technicians, health care workers and managers involved with diagnosis and care of Tuberculosis (TB). The interviews had their content analyzed in order to abstract the different perspectives for the various actors. For patients the changes were not perceived as significant, since their greatest concerns were related to treatment and the stigma associated with TB. The professionals in general welcomed the new technique, which dramatically decreases the workload, time and reliability of diagnosis, in their view. However, we noted difficulties with the concomitant implementation of new IT technology for recording and reporting test results, which negatively impacted the time necessary to get lab diagnosis to physicians. Through this analysis we detected some bottlenecks in the surrounding environment, not necessarily linked to the technology itself but which could hamper considerably its advantages.

[New normal ranges for TSH: when to treat?]. Subclinical forms of thyroid dysfunction rest purely on a biochemical definition. An increase or decrease of TSH compared to the laboratory norm defines the condition with thyroid hormone concentrations still within the norm. Recent population based large surveys defined a much narrower range of TSH levels between 0.3 and 2.5 mU/l. As TSH determinations are subject to modulations due to endogenous and exogenous factors including substantial variations due to the laboratory methods, therapeutic intervention should not be considered when TSH levels are below the long accepted threshold of 4.5-5 mU/l. This is supported by the lack of current data on an increased morbidity under these conditions. In contrast, subtle alterations of TSH in the context of subclinical hyperthyroidism are associated with a significantly higher risk particularly of atrial fibrillation.

Heart failure guidelines and implications for surgically treating heart failure. In 2005, the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association released updated guidelines for the diagnosis and management of chronic heart failure in the adult, yielding new insights into the progression and treatment of this disease. Perioperative nurses need a working knowledge of these guidelines to provide optimal care when patients require surgical interventions for heart failure. This article provides an overview of the pathophysiology, classifications, and treatments for heart failure.

An ultra-sensitive DeltaR/R measurement system for biochemical sensors using piezoresistive micro-cantilevers. Piezoresistive micro-cantilevers are interesting bio-sensing tool whose base resistance value (R) changes by a few parts per million (DeltaR) in deflected conditions. Measuring such a small deviation is always being a challenge due to noise. An advanced and reliable DeltaR/R measurement scheme is presented in this paper which can sense resistance changes down to 6 parts per million. The measurement scheme includes the half-bridge connected micro-cantilevers with mismatch compensation, precision op-amp based filters and amplifiers, and a lock-in amplifier based detector. The input actuating sine wave is applied from a function generator and the output dc voltage is displayed on a digital multimeter. The calibration is performed and instrument sensitivity is calculated. An experimental set-up using a probe station is discussed that demonstrates a combined performance of the measurement system and SU8-polysilicon cantilevers. The deflection sensitivity of such polymeric cantilevers is calculated. The system will be highly useful to detect bio-markers such as myoglobin and troponin that are released in blood during or after heart attacks.


Mechanisms of nitric oxide synthase uncoupling in endotoxin-induced acute lung injury: role of asymmetric dimethylarginine.

Amyloid PET in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease with BF-227: comparison to FDG-PET. We recently developed a novel PET tracer, (11)C-labeled 2-(2-[2-dimethylaminothiazol-5-yl]ethenyl)-6-(2-[fluoro]ethoxy)benzoxazole ([(11)C]BF-227), and had success with in vivo detection of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains (Kudo et al. in J Nucl Med 8:553-561, 2007). We applied this tracer to subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD in order to elucidate the status of amyloid plaque deposition in MCI and compared the diagnostic performance of BF-227-PET with that of FDG-PET in AD cases. We studied 12 aged normal (AN) subjects, 15 MCIs and 15 ADs with PET using [(11)C]BF-227. PET images were obtained after administration of BF-227 and the regional standardized uptake value (SUV) and the ratio of regional to cerebellar SUV were calculated as an index of BF-227 binding. AD patients showed increased uptake of [(11)C]BF-227 in the neocortical areas and striatum as well as decreased glucose metabolism in temporoparietal, posterior cingulate and medial temporal areas. MCI subjects showed a significant increase in BF-227 uptake in the neocortical areas similar to AD, and the most significant difference of BF-227 retention was observed in the parietal lobe if its retentions for MCI were compared to those for AD and AN. On the other hand, glucose hypometabolism in MCI was confined to cingulate and medial temporal cortices. Neocortical BF-227 uptake negatively correlated with glucose metabolism. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated higher specificity and sensitivity with BF-227-PET than those with FDG-PET for differential diagnosis between AD and normal control. We conclude that [(11)C]BF-227-PET has a possibility to be a useful technology for early detection of AD pathology and also even in the MCI stage.

MRI after implantation of a novel femoral closure device following intra-arterial catheterisation: implications for subsequent contrast-enhanced MR angiography. To assess MRI safety aspects and artefacts of a novel femoral artery closure device during contrast-enhanced MR angiography in patients following intra-arterial catheterisation. Ten consecutive patients underwent MRI within 24 h of coronary angiography and placement of a femoral artery closure device. We used a T2-weighted gradient-echo MRI sequence to measure the device-related artefact size in comparison with a phantom image, phase-contrast flow measurement proximal to, at the level of and distal to the device to quantify potential differences in flow velocity and contrast-enhanced 3D gradient-echo MR angiography to differentiate potential femoral artery stenosis from device-related artefacts. The mean size of the oval-shaped artefact was 8.4 x 6.6 mm (+/-1.0 x 0.8 mm) and was almost identical to the maximum artefact size of the phantom measurement (8.3 x 5.7 mm). Device placement did not result in an increased peak velocity (proximal 69 +/- 23 cm/s, at the level of 64 +/- 11 cm/s and distal to the device 63 +/- 12 cm/s, p = 0.67). The mean artefact penetration into the vessel lumen was 0.5 +/- 0.5 mm (percentage vessel narrowing 7.0 +/- 6%; range 0-16%). The MR conditional StarClose femoral artery closure device was used safely within 24 h of deployment at 1.5 T. Despite clip-related artefacts MR angiography will allow for easy differentiation of clip-related artefacts from high-grade atherosclerotic stenosis.

Re-orienting a remote acute care model towards a primary health care approach: key enablers. The objective of this study was to identify the key enablers of change in re-orienting a remote acute care model to comprehensive primary healthcare delivery. The setting of the study was a 12-bed hospital in Fitzroy Crossing, Western Australia. Individual key informant, in-depth interviews were completed with five of six identified senior leaders involved in the development of the Fitzroy Valley Health Partnership. Interviews were recorded and transcripts were thematically analysed by two investigators for shared views about the enabling factors strengthening primary healthcare delivery in a remote region of Australia. Participants described theestablishment of a culturally relevant primary healthcare service, using a community-driven, 'bottom up' approach characterised by extensive community participation. The formal partnership across the government and community controlled health services was essential, both to enable change to occur and to provide sustainability in the longer term. A hierarchy of major themes emerged. These included community participation, community readiness and desire for self-determination; linkages in the form of a government community controlled health service partnership; leadership; adequate infrastructure; enhanced workforce supply; supportive policy; and primary healthcare funding. The strong united leadership shown by the community and the health service enabled barriers to be overcome and it maximised the opportunities provided by government policy changes. The concurrent alignment around a common vision enabled implementation of change. The key principle learnt from this study is the importance of community and health service relationships and local leadership around a shared vision for the re-orientation of community health services.


Deep brain stimulation that abolishes Parkinsonian activity in basal ganglia improves thalamic relay fidelity in a computational circuit.

Dysfunctional nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) activity in ribosomes enhances adriamycin toxicity in budding yeast. To elucidate the role of ribosomes in the manifestation of adriamycin toxicity, ribosome-binding proteins involved in adriamycin sensitivity were identified using budding yeast as a eukaryotic model. This revealed that adriamycin toxicity was enhanced byloss of the Egd1 or Egd2 subunits of the nascent polypeptide-associated complex(NAC). NAC is a heterodimer consisting of alpha (Egd2) and beta (Egd1 or Btt1)subunits, and is known to be involved in the translocation of nascent polypeptides into mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum and in transcriptional activation in the nucleus. Because the loss of the Btt1 subunit had no effect on adriamycin sensitivity, the NAC conformation responsible for resistance to adriamycin appears to be the Egd1/Egd2 complex. We propose that functional NACin the ribosome is involved in resistance to adriamycin toxicity.


A method for automatic detection and classification of stroke from brain CT images.

Current concepts in ablation of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice. It occurs particularly frequently in cardiac surgical patients and is associated with significant excess mortality and morbidity. Pharmacological management of AF is relatively ineffective and associated with significant side effects and complications. Clinicians have therefore pursued more definitive treatment options, both catheter based and surgical, to treat patients with AF. Surgical techniques designed to cure AF have developed in parallel with an improved understanding of the pathophysiological processes underlying this condition. This review describes the rationale behind current surgical approaches to AF and summarizes the results achieved with current techniques.

Potential correlations of dentogenic factors to the development of clinically verified fungus balls: A retrospective computed tomography-based analysis. Fungus balls are a common disease of the paranasal sinuses, usually involving the maxillary sinus. To clarify the pathology, we analyzed patients treated for maxillary sinus fungus balls to see whether the latter correlated with dentogenic factors. Retrospective case analysis. Cases of maxillary sinus fungus balls diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2013 were analyzed retrospectively. Patients' charts were reviewed for diagnosis, gender, and age. Paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) scans were reviewed according to the side of the fungus ball, calcifications/opacifications, and dentogenic factors. In 98/102 patients (96.1%), 157 dentogenic factors could be identified on the side affected by a fungus ball. On the contralateral healthy side, there were 125 dentogenic factors. In four (3.9%) of the patients, no dentogenic pathology was identified on the CT scan. The presence of dentogenic factors (regardless of number) was significantly associated with a fungus ball compared to the healthy side (P = .024, Ï(2) test, odds ratio: 2.72 [95% confidence interval: 1.02-7.23]). Dentogenic factors regardless of type potentially correlate with the presence of maxillary sinus fungus ball. Unlike the overall presence of dentogenic factors, the particular dentogenic factors in an individual patient do not significantly influence the development of fungus balls. After diagnosis of dentogenic pathology in penetrated maxillary sinus floors, patients should be closely monitored and informed about their higher risk of developing a fungus ball.

Gene expression profiling in multiple sclerosis: a disease of the central nervous system, but with relapses triggered in the periphery? The aetiology of multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS), includes both genetic and environmental factors, but the pathogenesis is still incompletely known. We performed gene expression profiling on paired cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) samples from 26 MS patients without immunomodulatory treatment, sampled in relapse or remission, and 18 controls using Human Genome U133 plus 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix). In the CSF, 939 probe sets detected differential expression in MS patients compared to controls, but none in PBMCs, confirming that CSF cells might mirror the disease processes. The regulation of selected transcripts in CSF of MS patients was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Unexpectedly however, when comparing MS patients in relapse to those in remission, 266 probe sets detected differential expression in PBMCs, but not in CSF cells, indicating the importance of events outside of the CNS in the triggering of relapse.

Synergistic contributions of fullerene, ferrocene, chitosan and ionic liquid towards improved performance for a glucose sensor. The paper describes an ingenious approach for the fabrication of a promising glucose sensor, GOx/C(60)-Fc-CS-IL, that exploits the synergistic beneficial characteristics of fullerene (C(60)), ferrocene (Fc), chitosan (CS) and ionic liquid (IL) for glucose oxidase (GOx). Cyclic voltammetry, impedance spectroscopy and chronoamperometry were used to evaluate performance of the biosensor, respectively. Since efficient electron transfer between GOx and the electrode was achieved, the biosensor exhibits a high sensitivity (234.67 nA nM(-1) cm(-2)), low detection limit (S/N=3) (3x10(-9) M), fast response time (0.752 s), wide calibration range (from 1x10(-8) M to 1x10(-5) M) and excellent long-term stability (30 weeks). The apparent Michaelis-Menten constant (K(M)) of GOx on the composite medium, 0.03 mM, shows high bioelectrocatalytic activity of immobilized enzyme toward glucose oxidation. Due to low operating potential (100 V), the biosensor is relatively insensitive to electroactive interfering species in human blood such as ascorbic acid, and uric acid, which are commonly found in blood samples. Excellent electrochemical reversibility, high sensitivity and stability, technically simple and possibility of preparation at short period of time are of great advantages of these glucose biosensors.

Evaluation of steroidomics by liquid chromatography hyphenated to mass spectrometry as a powerful analytical strategy for measuring human steroid perturbations. This review presents the evolution of steroid analytical techniques, including gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS), immunoassay (IA) and targeted liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and it evaluates the potential of extended steroid profiles by a metabolomics-based approach, namely steroidomics. Steroids regulate essential biological functions including growth and reproduction, and perturbations of the steroid homeostasis can generate serious physiological issues; therefore, specific and sensitive methods have been developed to measure steroid concentrations. GC-MS measuring several steroids simultaneously was considered the first historical standard method for analysis. Steroids were then quantified by immunoassay, allowing a higher throughput; however, major drawbacks included the measurement of a single compound instead of a panel and cross-reactivity reactions. Targeted LC-MS methods with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) were then introduced for quantifying a small steroid subset without the problems of cross-reactivity. The next step was the integration of metabolomic approaches in the context of steroid analyses. As metabolomics tends to identify and quantify all the metabolites (i.e., the metabolome) in a specific system, appropriate strategies were proposed for discovering new biomarkers. Steroidomics, defined as the untargeted analysis of the steroid content in a sample, was implemented in several fields, including doping analysis, clinical studies, in vivo or in vitro toxicology assays, and more. This review discusses the current analytical methods for assessing steroid changes and compares them to steroidomics. Steroids, their pathways, their implications in diseases and the biological matrices in which they are analysed will first be described. Then, the different analytical strategies will be presented with a focus on their ability to obtain relevant information on the steroid pattern. The future technical requirements for improving steroid analysis will also be presented. 

Multiple electrode aggregometry predicts stent thrombosis better than the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation assay. The prognostic value of the vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP) phosphorylation assay and multiple electrode aggregometry (MEA) for thrombotic adverse events has been shown in independent studies. As no direct comparison between the two methods has been made so far, we investigated which laboratory approach has a better predictive value for stent thrombosis. The VASP phosphorylation assay and MEA were performed in 416 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The rate of stent thrombosis was recorded during a 6-month follow-up. Definite stent thrombosis occurred in three patients (0.7%) and probable stent thrombosis in four (1%). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis demonstrated that MEA distinguishes between patients with or without subsequent stent thrombosis better than the VASP phosphorylation assay: the area under the ROC curve was higher for MEA (0.92; P=0.012) than for the VASP phosphorylation assay (0.60; P=0.55). At equal levels of sensitivity (100%), the specificity was greater for MEA than for the VASP phosphorylation assay (86% vs. 37%). Stent thrombosis occurred in 9% of patients with platelet hyperreactivity in MEA, who were simultaneously clopidogrel non-responders in the VASP phosphorylation assay. Interestingly, clopidogrel non-responders in the VASP phosphorylation assay without platelet hyperreactivity in MEA did not suffer from stent thrombosis. Platelet hyperreactivity in MEA might be a better risk predictor for stent thrombosis than the assessment of the specific clopidogrel effect with the VASP phosphorylation assay.

The science and art of hyaluronic acid dermal filler use in esthetic applications. The number of dermal fillers has expanded dramatically; clinicians can benefit from practical information on their optimal use. To review key determinants of dermal filler performance, to discuss technical considerations, and to illustrate these factors based on the author's clinical experience. Current literature pertaining to the physicochemical properties of hyaluronic acid (HA) dermal fillers and implications for clinical use was reviewed. The author provides clinical guidelines for optimizing outcomes, illustrated with three case examples. Hyaluronic acids are nonimmunogenic, versatile, reversible, and have excellent benefit-risk profiles, making them near-ideal filling agents. They differ in their manufacturing processes, viscosity, hardness, cohesivity, ease of injection, and ideal uses. Patient counseling and education with individualized selection of the appropriate agent is critical to provide satisfactory outcomes. Clinicians must be technically proficient, balance esthetic need with facial anatomy, and consider HA properties to provide optimal outcomes.

Gastric necrosis and perforation as a severe complication of pancreatic pseudocyst. Patients with acute pancreatitis may present with stress-related gastrointestinal mucosal lesions. But severe gastrointestinal complications such as gastric perforation are very rare. Here, we report a 40-year-old man who was admitted due to acute pancreatitis and pseudocyst formation. During hospitalization, panendoscopic examination found multiple scattered stress ulcers over the gastric antrum and a large ulcerative area with suspicious malignant features at the body and fundus. The patient received surgical intervention due to worsening of his clinical condition. Postoperative findings showed a perforation of the gastric wall at the region in contact with the pseudocyst, and microscopic examination found diffuse ischemia and necrosis with intravascular thrombus and emboli in gastric vessels. We suggest keeping in mind that pancreatic pseudocyst may cause serious gastrointestinal complications including massive necrosis and perforation of the gastric wall.

Stochastic drift in mitochondrial DNA point mutations: a novel perspective ex silico. The mitochondrial free radical theory of aging (mFRTA) implicates Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)-induced mutations of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) as a major cause of aging. However, fifty years after its inception, several of its premises are intensely debated. Much of this uncertainty is due to the large range of values in the reported experimental data, for example on oxidative damage and mutational burden in mtDNA. This is in part due to limitations with available measurement technologies. Here we show that sample preparations in some assays necessitating high dilution of DNA (single molecule level) may introduce significant statistical variability. Adding to this complexity is the intrinsically stochastic nature of cellular processes, which manifests in cells from the same tissue harboring varying mutation load. In conjunction, these random elements make the determination of the underlying mutation dynamics extremely challenging. Our in silico stochastic study reveals the effect of coupling the experimental variability and the intrinsic stochasticity of aging process in some of the reported experimental data. We also show that the stochastic nature of a de novo point mutation generated during embryonic development is a major contributor of different mutation burdens in the individuals of mouse population. Analysis of simulation results leads to several new insights on the relevance of mutation stochasticity in the context of dividing tissues and the plausibility of ROS "vicious cycle" hypothesis.

[Health issues and preventive health strategies for adolescent girls]. As adolescent girls have specific healthcare needs, this paper was designed to provide a better understanding of their healthcare needs in both physical and psychosocial terms. After conducting a targeted review of the literature on children and adolescents, we identified factors of importance to physical health as body weight, physical activity, menstruation, sexual knowledge and attitude and to psychosocial health as anxiety, interpersonal relationships, depression, and suicide behavior. Reflecting these factors, this paper presents four preventive suggestions to clinical practice, education, and research to facilitate improvements in adolescent girl's health. These suggestions include: 1) strengthening health education and media responsibility with regard to adolescent girl health; 2) improving awareness of the needs of adolescent girls within healthcare and education organizations; 3) making health guidelines for promoting proper health behavior in adolescent girls; and 4) mobilizing nurses to assert the health of adolescent girls in clinical, education, and research fields. This is the first paper that focuses on the health needs of adolescent Taiwanese girls. The authors hope that more people become involved in the care of adolescent girl's health in Taiwan.

Non-pharmacological self-management of sleep among the Japanese general population. The present study was conducted to clarify the prevalence of non-pharmacological self-management (nPSM) practices for obtaining good sleep and to identify favorable nPSM practices that could be applied for reducing excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). We analyzed epidemiological data for an authentic representative sample of the Japanese population. Data obtained from 24,686 adults via a self-administered questionnaire completed in the Active Survey of Health and Welfare 2000 were used for analyses. The prevalence of individual nPSM practices was calculated by gender. Subsequently, the associations between such practices and EDS were examined using logistic regression analyses. "Having a bath" was the most prevalent nPSM practice for both men (59.0%) and women (64.4%), followed by "maintaining a regular schedule" (men: 49.0%, women: 58.6%), "reading or listening to music" (men: 43.4%, women: 49.4%), "snacking on food and/or beverages" (men: 36.1%, women: 27.9%), and "exercising" (men: 26.2%, women: 29.4%). The prevalence of "maintaining a regular schedule" increased with age. Multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that having a bath and maintaining a regular schedule had negative associations with EDS, whereas snacking on food and/or beverages had a positive association. Having a bath and maintaining a regular schedule were identified as favorable nPSM practices for reducing EDS, whereas snacking on food and/or beverages was considered to be an unfavorable nPSM practice.

[Study on family and economic burden caused by chronic Schistosomiasis japonica]. To evaluate the family and economic burden of chronic Schistosomiasis japonica. Relevant information on 226 chronic schistosomiasis patients from four surveillance sites in Yangxin county was collected. A questionnaire survey was conducted on 219 of them who agreed to corporate. Family burden was estimated with standard Family Burden Scale of Disease (FBS). Direct economic burden was calculated by questionnaire survey. Human capital method combined with Years Lived with Disability (YLDs) was adopted to evaluate the indirect economic burden. The positive rates on the dimensions of family economic burden and family entertainment were 54.8 percent and 47.0 percent respectively. The remaining dimensions were lower than 40.0 percent. Results of the questionnaire survey among 219 chronic Schistosomiasis patients showed that the total economic burden was 353,480.59 Chinese Yuan, which was 1614.07 Yuan per person. The direct and indirect economic burden were 61,679 and 291,801.59 Yuan respectively. The average direct and indirect economic burden when counted on money losses, were 281.64 and 1332.43 Yuan per person, respectively. The family burden caused by chronic Schistosomiasis japonica was serious, economically in particular. With regard to the income level of local residents, the economic burden of chronic Schistosomiasis was heavy to every household with indirect economic burden accounted for major proportion, suggesting close attention to be paid.

Antibody-based protein multiplex platforms: technical and operational challenges. The measurement of multiple protein biomarkers may refine risk stratification in clinical settings. This concept has stimulated development of multiplexed immunoassay platforms that provide multiple, parallel protein measurements on the same specimen. We provide an overview of antibody-based multiplexed immunoassay platforms and discuss technical and operational challenges. Multiplexed immunoassays use traditional immunoassay principles in which high-affinity capture ligands are immobilized in parallel arrays in either planar format or on microspheres in suspension. Development of multiplexed immunoassays requires rigorous validation of assay configuration and analytical performance to minimize assay imprecision and inaccuracy. Challenges associated with multiplex configuration include selection and immobilization of capture ligands, calibration, interference between antibodies and proteins and assay diluents, and compatibility of assay limits of quantification. We discuss potential solutions to these challenges. Criteria for assessing analytical multiplex assay performance include the range of linearity, analytical specificity, recovery, and comparison to a quality reference method. Quality control materials are not well developed for multiplexed protein immunoassays, and algorithms for interpreting multiplex quality control data are needed. Technical and operational challenges have hindered implementation of multiplexed assays in clinical settings. Formal procedures that guide multiplex assay configuration, analytical validation, and quality control are needed before broad application of multiplexed arrays can occur in the in vitro diagnostic market.

Spinal root origins and innervations of the suprascapular nerve. The suprascapular nerve branches provide efferent innervation to the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles as well as sensory innervation to the shoulder joint. This study was carried out to verify the spinal root origins and innervations of the suprascapular nerve. Fifty samples of the suprascapular nerve taken from 37 adult Korean cadavers were used in this study. The suprascapular nerve was found to comprise the ventral rami of the C5 and C6 in 76.0% of the fifty samples; C4, C5, and C6 nerves in 18.0%; and C5 nerve in only 6.0%. The C5 nerve was consistently shown to be the largest in mean diameter and was found to be a major contributor of nerve fibers leading to the suprascapular nerve. This study shows that the main spinal component of the suprascapular nerve is C5 nerve. In most cases, the rate of the involvement of the C4 and C6 nerves (18.0 and 94.0%, respectively) with the suprascapular nerve was less than that of C5 nerve. C4 and C5 nerves were shown to contribute nerve fibers to the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscles and to both shoulder joints, whereas C6 nerve displayed variable patterns of innervation.

Human rhinovirus causes severe infection in preterm infants. Data of 11 infants (median gestational age and birth weight 30 weeks and 1520 g, respectively) with severe human rhinovirus infection (HRV) are described. Nine of 11 (82%) were preterm infants and 7 of these 9 (78%) became infected during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit. All infants presented with respiratory distress and all needed respiratory support for a median of 6 days. Radiologic findings included perihilar streakiness, atelectasis, focal consolidation, and hyperinflation. The diagnosis of HRV infection was made by real-time polymerase chain reaction in nasopharyngeal aspirate. All infants recovered from their HRV infection. HRV can cause severe disease in preterm infants requiring respiratory support.

[Autophosphorylation of erythrocyte insulin receptors in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome].

Sp2 is a maternally inherited transcription factor required for embryonic development. The Sp family of transcription factors is required for the expression of cell cycle- and developmentally regulated genes, and the deregulated expression of a handful of family members is associated with human tumorigenesis. Sp2 is a relatively poorly characterized member of the Sp family that, although widely expressed, exhibits little or no DNA binding or transcriptional activity in human and mouse cell lines. To begin to address the role(s) played by Sp2 in early metazoan development we have cloned and characterized Sp2 from zebrafish (Danio rerio). We report that 1) the intron/exon organization and amino acid sequence of zebrafish Sp2 is closely conserved with its mammalian orthologues, 2) zebrafish Sp2 weakly stimulates an Sp-dependent promoter in vitro and associates with the nuclear matrix in a DNA-independent fashion, 3) zebrafish Sp2 is inherited as a maternal transcript, is transcribed in zebrafish embryos and adult tissues, and is required for completion of gastrulation, and 4) zebrafish lines carrying transgenes regulated by the Sp2 promoter recapitulate patterns of endogenous Sp2 expression.

[Effect of hepatocyte-like cells induced by CD34+ cells in vitro on the repair of injured hepatic tissues of mice in vivo].

Effects of a grapeseed procyanidin extract (GSPE) on insulin resistance. Flavonoids are beneficial compounds against risk factors for metabolic syndrome, but their effects and the mechanisms on glucose homeostasis modulation are not well defined. In the present study, we first checked the efficacy of grapeseed procyanidin extract (GSPE) for stimulating glucose uptake in insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Results show that when resistance is induced with chronic insulin treatment, GSPE maintain a higher stimulating capacity than insulin. In contrast, when dexamethasone is used as the resistance-inducing agent, GSPE is less effective. Next we evaluated how effective different GSPE treatments are at improving glucose metabolism in hyperinsulinemic animals (fed a cafeteria diet). GSPE reduced plasma insulin levels. The lower dose (25 mg GSPE/kg body weight per day) administered for 30 days improved the HOmeostasis Model Assessment-insulin resistance index. This was accompanied by down-regulation of Pparg2, Glut4 and Irs1 in mesenteric white adipose tissue. Similarly, a chronic GSPE treatment of insulin-resistant 3T3-L1 adipocytes down-regulated the mRNA levels of those adipocyte markers, although cells were still able to respond to the acute stimulation of glucose uptake. In summary, 25 mg/kg body weight per day of GSPE has a positive long-term effect on glucose homeostasis, and GSPE could be targeted at adipose tissue, where it might directly stimulate glucose uptake. This work also highlights the need to carefully consider the bioactive dose, since a higher dose does not necessarily correlate to a greater positive effect.

[Lymphangioleiomyomatosis]. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare pulmonary disease encountered almost exclusively in women of reproductive age. Pulmonary involvement is characterized by multiple thin-walled cysts in the lungs, recurrent pneumothorax, obstructive lung disorders, and progression to chronic respiratory failure over a mean period of 10 years. Certainty of diagnosis requires a lung biopsy, but international criteria have been proposed for a diagnosis without such a biopsy. International recommendations were recently issued for the diagnosis and treatment of lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Treatment is principally symptomatic and relies on the management of bronchial obstruction by bronchodilators; of hypoxemia by oxygen therapy; of pleural complications by pleurodesis, most often surgical; and of renal angiomyolipomas by percutaneous embolization in cases of hemorrhagic risk. Hormone treatment is not recommended. Hopes are high for mTor inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus) and treatment trials are currently underway. Lung transplantation must be considered when chronic respiratory failure occurs in patients younger than 60 years.

Texture-based computer-assisted diagnosis for fiberscopic images. Flexible endoscopes based on fiber bundles are still widely used despite the recent success of so-called tipchip endoscopes. This is partly due to the costs and that for extremely thin diameters (below 3 mm) there are still only fiberscopes available. Due to the inevitable artifacts caused by the transition from the fiber bundles to the sensor chip, image and texture analysis algorithms are severely handicapped. Therefore, texture-based computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems could not be used in such domains without image preprocessing. We describe a CAD system approach that includes an image filtering algorithm to remove the fiber image artifacts first and then applies conventional color texture algorithms that have been applied to other endoscopic disciplines in the past. The concept is evaluated on an image database with artificially rendered fiber artifacts so that ground truth information is available.

[Self-medication with antibiotics obtained from private pharmacies in Abidjan, Ivory Coast]. Self-medication with antibiotics is all the more disturbing in developing countries where this type of medication is easily available, and often without any prescription. The authors wanted to assess and describe self-medication with antibiotics and identify the factors and public perception associated with this type of self-medication. Eighteen private pharmacies were randomly selected in Abidjan. Data was collected through structured questionnaires and reports. Group meetings were organized for private pharmacy clients and the pharmacy staff. Two hundred and forty-two out of 1,123 purchases of antibiotics were for self-medication (21.5 %). Out of the 1,765 people interviewed, 1,054 (59.7 %) had bought antibiotics for self-medication in the 12 months prior to our study. Pharmacy staff very rarely provided any information to purchasers concerning dose, when to take the medicine, or treatment duration. A logistic regression analysis showed that the probability of self-medication with antibiotics increased with several factors: age, education level, and the possibility of purchasing antibiotics on the marketplace. However, this risk decreased when patients were covered by medical insurance, when the public perceived the risks of self-medication, and when bacterial resistance was clearly defined. This study was the first in the Ivory Coast to analyze the factors involved in antibiotic self-medication. It stressed the need to establish sustainable interventions to control the antibiotic use.

Mental State Inferences Abilities Contribution to Verbal Irony Comprehension in Older Adults with Mild Cognitive Impairment. The present study examined mentalizing capacities as well as the relative implication of mentalizing in the comprehension of ironic and sincere assertions among 30 older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 30 healthy control (HC) subjects. Subjects were administered a task evaluating mentalizing by means of short stories. A verbal irony comprehension task, in which participants had to identify ironic or sincere statements within short stories, was also administered; the design of the task allowed uniform implication of mentalizing across the conditions. Findings indicated that participants with MCI have second-order mentalizing difficulties compared to HC subjects. Moreover, MCI participants were impaired compared to the HC group in identifying ironic or sincere stories, both requiring mental inference capacities. This study suggests that, in individuals with MCI, difficulties in the comprehension of ironic and sincere assertions are closely related to second-order mentalizing deficits. These findings support previous data suggesting a strong relationship between irony comprehension and mentalizing.

Single- and repeated-dose oral toxicity studies of citicoline free-base (choline cytidine 5'-pyrophosphate) in Sprague-Dawley rats. The dietary supplement Citicoline free-base (choline cytidine 5'-pyrophosphate) was toxicologically evaluated in Sprague-Dawley rats using oral gavage. In an acute 14-day study, 2000 mg/kg was well tolerated. In a 90-day study, 100, 350, and 1000 mg/kg/day doses resulted in no mortality. In males, slight significant increases in serum creatinine (350 and 1000 mg/kg/day), and decreases in urine volume (all treated groups) were observed. In females, slight significant increases in total white blood cell and absolute lymphocyte counts (1000 mg/kg/day), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (100 and 350, but not 1000 mg/kg/day) were noted. A dose-related increase in renal tubular mineralization, without degenerative or inflammatory reaction, was found in females (all treated groups) and two males (1000 mg/kg/day). Renal mineralization in rats (especially females) is influenced by calcium:phosphorus ratios in the diet. A high level of citicoline consumption resulted in increased phosphorus intake in the rats, and likely explains this result.
