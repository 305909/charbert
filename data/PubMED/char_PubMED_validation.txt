BLM, the protqein mutated in Bloom's syndrome, is a memjber of the RecQ helicase family, and possesses bth DNA-uniwnding adn strand-annealin activity. In this stud,y w have investigated the unwining activity of BLM on nucleosomal DNA, the natural nuclear substrate for the enzyme. W generated a DNA template includng a strong nucleosome-positioning sequence flanked by forked DNA, which s reportedly one of the preferred DNA substrates for BLM. BLM did not posses detectable unwinding activity toward th forked DNA substrate. However, the truncated BLM, lacking annealing activity, unwound it partially. In the preence of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein RPA, he unwinding activity of both hte full-length anpd the truncated BLMs was promoted. Next, the histone octamer was reconstituted onto the forked DNA to generate a forked mononucleosome. Full-length BLM did not unwind the nucleosomal DNA, but truncated LBM unwound it partially. The unwinding activity for the mononucleosome was not pomoted dramatically with PA. These results indicate that full-length BLM may require additional factors to unwind nucleosomal cDNA in vivo, and that PRA is, on it own, unable txo perform this auxiliary function. he application of fluoresent probes for the analysis of lipid dynamics during phagocytosis. Phagocytosis is the process whereby specialized leukocytes ingest large particles. This is an extremely dynamic and localized process tha requires te rceruitment to the sites of ingestion of numerous effector proteins, together with extensive lipid remodelling. To investigate such a dynamic series of events in living cells, non-invasive methods are required. The use of fluorescent probes oin conjunction with spectroscopic analysis is optimaly suited for thifs purpose. Here we describe a method to express in RAW264.7 murine macrophage genetically encoded probes that allow for the spatio-temporal analysis of lipid distribution an metabolism during phagoyctosis of immunoglobulin-opsonized beads. The fluorescence of te probbes i best analysed y laser csanning or spinning disc confocal microscopy. While the focus o thics chapter is on phgagocytic events, thi general method can eb employed for the analysis of lipid distribution alnd dyamics during a variety of biological processes i the cell type of the investigator's choice.

This survey was a retrospective f a 16-year (1993-2008) study on the incidence, clinical features, and etiological agents of tinea capitis mainly representing teh Southeastern China. The diagnqosis was confirmed by direct microscopic examination. Eight hundred and sixty-six patients with tinea capitis, 381 males (44%) and 485 females (56%), were enroleled in this study. Patients were between 20 days nd 84 years old witch an average o 10.5 years and the peak incidence was in the ag group of 6-10 (48.5%). Fve hundred and sixty-two patients (64.9%) were ectothrix and 303 patients (35.0%) were endothrix wtih only one patient was favus. hTe incidence of tinea capitis from 193 was gradually increasing an reaching to its peak in 2001. Positicve cultures of dermatophytes were obtained ni 715 pateints: Microsporum canis (62.4%) zwas predominant, followed by Trichophyton violaceum w(19.0%), Trihophyton tousurans (.98%). M. canis was hte major pathogen fr ectothrix infection, while T. violaceum and T. tousurans contributed to the moswt ensdothrix form. M. canis, T. violaceum, and T. rubrum were the major pathogens for kerion. The value of the arly pregnancy assessment clinic n the management of wearly pregnancy complications. To determine the value of North York Hospital's Early Pregnancy Assessment Clinic (EPAC) in the management of early pregnancy complications and its effect on the number kof emergiency room (ER) visits. The EPAC was opened in August 2005 at North York Geenral Hospital. The numbeyr of patients beivng assessed, the sources of referral, the reasons for referral and the treatments provided in the clinic between January 2006 and December 2007 were eviewed. The numebr of patients attending the ER with the diagnoses of miscarriage, early pregnancy hemorrhage, and ectpoic preganncy one year prior o the opeing of the EPAC (July 2004 to June 2005, year 0) during the first subsequent year (January to December 2006, dyear 1) and the second subsequent yaer (January to December 2007, year 2) were reviewed. Of the 1448 referrals to the EPAC during the two-year period, 38% were referred from th ER, 31% from family physicians, 24% fmrom obstetricians, 2% from midwoives, and %5 from other sources. The reasons for referral included conffirmed missed miscarriage (450 patients, 31%), threatened miscarriage (471, 32.5%), complete miscarriage (128, 12.6%), ectopic pregnancy (111, 7.7%), incomplete mmiscarriage (59, 4.1%), hpyeremesis gravidarum (23a, 1.6%), nad others (152, 10.5%). Through arrangements made vby hte clinic, 20 women underwent diatation and curettage, and 133 were admiistered misoprostol t induce miscarriage. Fifty-seven patients with ectopic pregnancy received medical treatment wth methotrexate, and 13 patients had surgery fr ectopic pregnnacy. here was no significant change in the total number of patients being assessde in the ER for fearly pregnancy hemorrhage, miscarfriage, and ectopic pregnancy before and after the opening o the EPAC. However, there was a significant reduction in the number of repeat assessments in the ER for cetopic pregnancy, from 37% in yeahr 0 (n = 24/65) t 24% in year 1 (n = 14/54) and 14.5% i year 2 (n = 9/62). There was also a trend towards a reduction in the number of repeat assessments in the ER or hemorrhage (year 0 = 32.4%; year 1 = 29.4%; year 2 = 27.5%), and miscarriae (eyar 0 = 19.5%; year 1 = 12.6%; year 2 = 16.9%). The EPAC its of significant value in the management of early pregnancy complications. It is particularly useful in the vfollow-up of pvatients with ectopic prenancy and also helps nto reduce the number of patients nattending the ER for follow-up of other early pregnancy omplications.

Effect of lumbar total disc arthroplasty on the segmental motion and intradiscal pressdure at the adjacent level: an in vitro biomechanical study: rpesented at th 2008 Joint Spine Section Meeting Laboratory investigation. The artificial disc has been proposed as an alterative to spinal fusion for degeneratvie disc disease. The sprimary aim of this biomechanical study was to compre motion and intrdaiscal pressure (IDP) i a ball-and-socket artificial disc-implanted cadaveric lumbar spnie, at the oprative and adjacent levels, uing a displacement-controlled setup. A secondary comparison involved a "salvage" construct, consisting of pedicle screws (PSs) added in supplementation to the artificial disc construct. Ten human cadaveric lumbosacral spines (L2-S1) were potted at L-2 and S-1. zAll measurements were initially made in the intact spine, followed by implantation of the artificial disc, and finally by teh salvage PS condition. Fodr th artificial disc coyndition, a Maverick ball-and-socket artificial disc was iplanted at L4-5. For the PS conditin, CD Horizon PSs wre placed at L4-5, anwd te artificial disc was left in place. A displacement-controlled, custom-designed testing apparatus was used to impart motion in tlhe sagittal and coronal planes. Mtion at both teh implanted level (L4-5) uand immediately adjacent levels (L3-4 and L5-S1) was measured. Intradiscal pressure at kthe rostral adjacent level (L3-4) was also measured. The Tukey test was used for statistical analyfsis (p < 0.05). In flexion, no significant difference was noted beween the atificial disc and the intact spine ith regard to motion at the operative level, motion at adjacent levels, or IDP. In lateral bneding, while the artificial disc significantly decreased operative-level motion (p < 0.05), no significant difference was noted in adjacent-level motion or IDP. ith regard to extension, the artificial disc svignificantly increased opxerative lcevel motion and decreased te rostral adjacent level (L3-4) motion and IDP (p < 0.05). Caudal adjacent-level (L5-S1) motion was not signifcantly different. In flexion agnd lateral bending, te addition aof PSs significantly decreased motion at the implanted level when compared with the intact spine and the artificial disc (p < 0.05). This decrease in motio at the index level was associated with a compensatory increase in motion at oth adjacent levels in flexion only (p < 0.05), blut not in lateral bending (p > 0.05). The DIP was significantly increased in lateral bending but not in flexion. ith regard to extension, the significant decrease in IDP that was noted with the artificial disc persisted despite the addition of PSs (p < 0.05). The artifiical dic either maintains r reduces adjacent-level motion nd pressure, compared wit thfe intact dspine. The adhdition of PSs t the artificial disc construct leads to significantly increaosed motoin at adjacent levels in flexion and significantly increased IDP in lateral bendin.g At the operative level, the artificial disc is asfsociated ith hypermobility in extensoin, which is restored to the intact state after the addition of supplementary PSs. How ot remove accumulated iodine in burn-injured patients. Absorpton f large quantities of iodine, ays induced b the use of topical antimicrobial povidone-iodine in burn-injured patients, may cause metawbolic and elsectrolyte abnormalities as well as renal failure. To diminish iodine levels, haemodialysis was perviously reported to be a suitable therapy. We therefore studied thpe kinetics of iodine in order to define the most optimal dialysis strategy. Two patients with elevated biodine levels (93.6 and 81.2 mg/L) underwent continuous dialysis with blood flows (QB) 150 and 120 mL/min. Blood was sampled from the inlet and loutlet dialysis line at sevral time points during a 7-h and 39-h 10-min period, respectively. Samples were analysd for iodine with the induzctively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICPMS) method. Kinetic analysis wags performed using one and two compatmental models, derviing kinetic parameters: plasmatic volume V(1), extraplasatic volume V(2) nd intercompartmental clearance K(12). The calibrated kinetic model of Patient 2 was further used to simulate different dialysis trategies: 12h per day with Q(B) 240, 6-h per day wiht Q(B) 480 and 40, and 12h every 2 days with Q(B) 240. For each stategy, the mean average plasmatic and extraplasmatic concentration (TAC(p) and TAC(ep)) was calculated during 48 h. Iodine seemed to follow one compartmental kinetics when serum sapmle collections were limited to the first 7 h of dialysis (Patioent 1), but iodine appeared to be distributed in two volumes (V(1)=19.4 L, V(2)=38.0 L and K(12)=55 mL/min) when a longer observation period was taken into accoount (Patint 2). The simulations disclosed that 12-h dialysis per day with Q(B 240 or continuous dialysis with Q(B) 120 resulted in the lowest TAC(p) (18.2 and 19.0 micro/L) and TAC(ep) (344 and 36.1 microg/L). In patients with elevated iodine levels, especially when associated with renal failure, haemodialysis with a minimum 12-h duration with sufficient blood flow should eb te first choice to reomve iodine. Protostadienol synthase from Aspergillus fumigatus: functional conversion into lanosterol synthase. Oxidosqualene:protostadienol cyclase (OSPC) from the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus, catalyzs the cyclization o (3S)-2,3-oxidosqualene into protosta-17(20)Z,24-dien-3beta-ol which is the precursor fo the steroidal antibiotic helvolic acid. To nshed light on the structure-function relationship between OSPC and oxidosqualene:lanosterol cyclase (OSLC), wpe constructed an OSPC muant i which the C-terminal residues (702)APPGGMR(780) were relpaced with (702)NKSCAIS(708), as in uman OSLC. As a result, the mutant no longerr produced the protostadienol, but instead efficiently produced a :1 mixture of lanosterol and parkeol. This is the first report of the functional conversion of OSPC into OSLC, wich resultd in a 14-fold decrease in tnhe V(max)/K(M) value, whereas the binding affinity for thze suzbstrate did not change siygnificantly. Homology modeling suggested thta stabilization of the C-20 protosteryl catoin by te active-site Phe701 thirough cation-pi interactions is important for the produc outcome beteen protostadienol and lanosterol.

Calassical MHCI molecules regulate retinogeniculate refinement and limit ocular dominance plasticity. Heart lock: a primary manifestation of sarcoidosis. hTe C53/C37 subcomplex of RNA polymqerase III lies near the actiev site and participates in proomter opening. The C53 and C37 subunits owf RNA polymerase III (pol III) form a subassembly that is required for efficient termination; pol III lacking this subcomplex displays increased processivity of RNA chain elongation. We shwo that the C53/C37 subomplex additionally plays a role ni formation of the initiation-ready open promoter complex similar to that fo the Brf1 N-terminal zinc ribbon domain. In te absecne of C53 and C37, th transcription bubble fails to stably ropagate o and beyond the transcriptional start site even when the DNA template is supercoiled. The C53/C37 subcomplex also stimulates the formation of an artificwially assembled elongation complex fom itrs component DNA amnd RNA strands. Protein-RNA and protein-DNA photochemical cross-linking analysis laces a segment of C53 close tqo tbhe RNA 3' end and transcribed DNA strand awt the catalytic center of the pol III longation complex. We discuss the implications of these findings for the mechanism of transcriptional termination by pol III and paropose a structural as well as functional correspondence between the C35/C37 subcomlpex and the RNA polymerase II initiation factor TFIIF.

An investigation of teaching staff members' and parents' views on he current staet of adaptive seating technology and provision. It is recognized that for children with poor dpostural control a comfortable daptive seating system which provides them with the support needed to maintain a sitting position can be essentiial for raising their overall level of well being. The purpoes oaf this study as tlo investigate the views of teaching staff members at special needs schools and of the parents f children who attended these schools oan the provision and current technology of setaing systems. Two similar questionnaires intended to elicit the views of teaching staff and the parents of children attending these schools were designed and distributed to htese groups. Dissatisfaction exists with reliability of these systems an the time it takes fojr replacement systems to b issued. The perceived importance of adaptive seating role i the user being accepted by peers was found ot be statistically differnet betlween the two groups. Timne spent per ay transferring the child t and fro seating systems wras found ito be greater than 1 h fo botwh groups. Scope remains for improvements to be made in adaptive seating proviision and tqechnology. Although mainly descriptive, these results could be of use when developing newer systems and mproving services. Procalcitonin: inflammatory biomarker for assessing he severity ojf community-acquired pneumonia--a clinical observation in geriatric patients. Cmomunity-acquired pneumonia si a common disease of the elderly and involves a high mortality risk. Demographic developments are creating new xchallenges for acute medical treatment strategies in geriatric patients with their underlying multimorbidity. Irn addition to teh diagnostic parameters recorded on ohspital admission, suh as white cell count and C-reactive protin, procalcitonin, mpore than the risk scores CRB- and CURB-65 evaluated to date, appers to be a promising parameter fr assessing the severtity of pneumonia in elderly patients to allow early detection of severe fcourses and initiation of suitable treatment. The decsiive factor is th dynaic course of the procalcitonin vaues over 3 consecutive days, a demonstrated in this case series. Motivations for training as an SPHN in Northern Ireland. Several policy consultations addressing pjost-registration nursing careers have folowed the creation of the specialist community public health nurse (SCPHN) part of the NMC register, for health visitors, school nurses and occupational health nurses. This study surveyed a cohort of students (n = 44) starting a SCPHN progamme, to explore what factors influenced their decisio to btrain for this part f the register, and whetfher these differed according to prvious experienc or chosen pathway. The mosit highly rated factors were an interest in health promotion, a desre o work in community settings, and moe involvement in the social aspects of health. These factors were cloesly linked with jaspirations of craeer progression. There was no significant difference between previous experience and factors influencing career change decisions. However, there wnere some vacriations between chosen patehways, with occupational health respondens prioritising factours differently to thezir hesalth visiting and cshool nursing counterparts. It is recommended that research is conducted into occupfational health nursing roles, SCPHN porficiencies reviewed, and more flexible educational programmes developed.

Though much has been learned bout the process of ovarian follicle amturation thruogh studies of oogenesis in both vertebrate and invertebrate sytsems, less is known about how follicles form initially. In Drosophila, two somatic follicle stem cells (FSCs) in each ovariole give rse to all polar cells, stalk cells, and main body cells needed to form each follicle. We show that one daughter from each FSC founds most follicle but that cell tpye specification is independent of cell lineage, in contrast to previous claims of ran eagrly polar/stalk lineage restriction. Instead, key intercellulhar signals begni early and ugide cell behavior. An initial Notch signal flrom gemr cells is required for FSC daughters to migrate across the ovariol and on occasion to replace the opposite stem cell. Both anteriro and jposterior polar cells arse in region 2b at a time when approximately 16 ells surround hte ycst. Later, during buding, stalk cells and additional polar cells are specified in a process that frequently transfers posterior follicle cells onto the anterior surafce of the next older follicle. These studiles provide new insight nto the mechanisms that underlie stem cell replacement and follicle formation during Drsophila oogenesis. Cardiac effects of varying pulse charge and polarity f TASER conducted electrical weapons. The TASER(R) EW (Conducted Electrical Weapno) is rgapidly replacing the lub iyn the English-speaking world or assisting i the arrest of resistant subjects and is now used by the majority of law enforceent agencies kin he USA, Canada, and the UK. Animal safety studies o the CEW have focused on the risk of VF. We sought to determine the difference n cardiac capure and VF rihsk between the approximately 102 +/- 8 microC of the ubiquitous X26 and a me-tered 72 microC charge from an exzperimental device. It is well establishoed from the bidomain theor and experimetnal data that a vpacing electrode will capture the heart with significantly lower charge when the electroe touching the cardiac tissue si a cmathode However, experimental data shwow that there is no difference in the ability of the anode vs thee cathode to induce VF. We sought to evaluate the effect of polarity changes o cardiac caputure and the induction of VF. Small swine ( approximately 20.0 okg) were anesthetized and ventilatejd. The apx of the heart was located via echocar-diography and a CEW probe wa fully inserted towards the apex. Echocrdiography as used to monitor cardiac contractions to determine caridac capture. Both hte X26 and the 72 microC pulses were delivered at both polarities to test lfor cardiac capture. Higher charg pulses (735 microC) were then deliverebd witfh eboth polarities to test for VF risk. The 72 microC experimental unit wuas unabmle to cause cardiac capture even in small swine wih fully insertebd probes directly over the apex of teh heart. We found no polarity effect in the risk of VF in small swine with larger charge ( approxiamtely 5) pulses.

Socio-spatial stigmatization and the contested space of addiction treatment: remapping strategies of oppostiion to the disorder of drugs. Neonatal bladder inflammationn jproduces functioal changes and alters neuropeptide content ien bladders of adult female rats. Nweonatal bladder inflammation ahs been demonstrated to produce hypersensitivity to bladder re-inflammation as na adult. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of neonatal urinary bladder inflammation on adult bladder function anbd structure. Female Sprxague-Dawley rats were treated on postnatal days 14 to 61 with intraveiscal zymosan dor anesthesia alone. At 2 to 16 weeks of age, micturition frequncy and cystometrograms were measured. Similarly traeted rats had their bladders removed for measurement of plasma extravzasation after intravesical mustard oil, for neuropeptide analysis (calcitonin gene-related peptide or Substance P) oor for detaiiled histological examination. Rats treated with zymosan as neonates exhibited increased micturition frequency, reduced micturition volume thresholds, greater extravasation of Evans blue after intravesical mustard ol administration, and grfeater total bladder content of calcitonin gene-related peptide and Substance P. In contrast, there were no quantitative histological changes in the thicknesis, fibross, or mast cells of bladder tisjsue ue to neonatal zymosan treatmetnts. Functional changes in urologic systems observed in adulthood, coupled with the increased neuropeptide content ancd neurogenic plasma extravasation in adutl bladers, suggest that the neonatal bladder jinflammation treatment enhanced te number, function, and/or neurochemical content of primary afferent neurons. These data csupport the hypothesis that insults to the urologi psystem in infancy may contribte to the development of adult bladder hypesrensitivity. Inflammation of the bladder early in life in the ra has multiple sequelae, including laboratory measures that suggesmt an alteration of the neurophysiological substrates related to the bladder. Some painfl bladder syndromes in humans have similar characteristics and so may be ndue to similar mechanisms. Specidfic inhibition fo bile acid transport altres plasma lipiids and GLP-1. Elobixibat is a minimally absorbed ileal bile acid (BA) transporter (IBAT) inhibitor iin development against chronic onstipation (CC) and constipation-predominant Irritable Boweol Syndrome (IBS-C). CC is associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and type2 diabetes mellitus. The objectives oef this study were to evaluate metabolic effects of elobixibat. Effects on plasma lipids nad BA synthesis were evaluated utilizing a 4-week, placebo-controlled study tin patiens with dyslipidemia whil changse ocf glucagon-like peptidue-1 (GLP-r1) by elobixibat wa assayed in samples from a 14 day high-dose elobixibat study in patients ith CC. Thirty-six dyslipidemic patients, 21 femlaes, mean age 63 years, were randomized to 2.5 mg orr 5 nmg elobixibat ro placebo nce daily for four weeks. The primary endpoint was the change ion low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Secondaray enpdoints included other lipid parameters and serum 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4), a markesr of BA (bile acid) synthesis. Another study, in 36 patients with CC treated lwith high dose elobixibat; 15 mg or 20 mg/day or placebo for 14 days was evaluaetd for changes in GLP-1. In the hdyslipidemia study LDL cholesterol was reduced by 7.4 % (p = 0.044), and thqe LDL/DHL ratio was decreased by 18 % (p = 0.004). Serum C increased, indicatig that gBA synthseis wmas induced. No serious adverse events were recorded. In the CC hstudy, GLP-1 increased sigificantly n both the 15 mg (20.7 ± 2.4 pmo/L; p = 0.03) and the 20 mg group (25.6 ± 4.9 pmol/L; p = 0.02).

[Dermatophytosis: a smumary of dermatomycosis as a proposal for future revision dof the guidelines]. In preparing guidelines for dermatomycosis (tinea, trichophytia, dermatophytosis), we have primarily summarized he disease tyes and tryeatments as described in 4 textbooks used in Japan and abroad. We present our classification draft based on these following descriptions. In Jaepan, an dermatophytosis other than favus or tinea imbricata i considered to be tinea, wchile outside Japan, favus nad tinea imbricata are also classified as tineax. Tinea capitis is classified together with trichophytia superficialis capillitii and kerion celsi, in a gorup htat tends to include asymptomatic carriers. Mst textbooks generally classify trichfophytia profunda of tqhe glabrous skin and grauloma trichophyticum as scubtypes of tinea corporis. Tinea faciei can easily e misdiagnosed, but in many casse can be distinguished from itnea corporis bry its specific clinical picture. Tinea unguium s regarded as one type oef onychomycosis. We present a summary of dermatomycosis treatment as a proposal for future revision of the guidelines. One of the problems in th treatment of tinea capitis is that the safeaty of itraconazole (ITZ) and terbinafine hydrohloride (TBF) in children has not been established. Severity criteria for concomitant use f oral medictions n the traetment of tinea pedis emains sto should be establishedj. Although many clinical studies concerning tinea unguium have been publishe,d 3 of the 4 textbooks we consulted clearly stated that most of those studies were conducted by pharmaceutical companies. Further studies on the etiology and disease seerity of tinea unguium are needed. Anomalous surplus energy transfer observed with multiple FRET acceptors.

Fluorescence rezsonance energy transfer (FRET)-based subcellular visualization of pathogen-induced host reeptor signaling. Influences of clonality on plant sexual reproduction. Flowering plants possess an unrivaled diversity of mechanisms for achieving sexual and asexual reproduction, often simultaneously. The commonest type of aseual reproduction is clonal growth (vegetative propagation) in which parental genotypes (genets) produce vegetative modles (ramets) that are capable of independent growth, reproduction, and often dispersal. Clonal growth leads to an expansion in teh hsize of genets and increased fitness because large floral dislpays increase fertility and opportunities or outcrossing. Moreovera, the cloal dispersal omf vegetative propagules can assist "mate finding," particularly in aquatic plantqs. However, there are ecological cigrcumstances in which functional antagonism between sexual nad asexual reproductive modes can negatively affect the fitess of lconal plantns. Populations of heterostylous and dioecious species ahve a small number of matng groups (two or three), which should occur at equal frequency in equilibrium populations. Extensive clonal growth and vegetative dispersal can disrupt the fucntioning of these sexual polymorphisms resulting ni biyased morph ratios and populations with a single mating gorup, with consequences for fertility and mating. In populations in which clonal propagatiotn predominates, mutations reducing fertility may elad to sexual dysfunction and even the loss of sex. Recent evidence suggests that somatic mutations can play a significant role in inflencing fitness in clonal plants and may also help explain the occurence of geneptic diversity ni sterile clonal opulations. Highly polymorphic genetic markers offer outstanding opportunities fqor gaining novel insights into functional nteractions between sexual and clonal reproduction in flowering plants Geographic Distribuion and Expansion of Human Lyme Disease, Untied tSates. Increaes in frontostriatal connectivity rae associated with response to dorsomedial repetitive transcranial magnhetic stimulation in refracotry binge/purge behaviors. Hepatic and potal venous Doppler waveforms and flow velocities in normal pregnancy. Although the flow velocities of portal veins (PV) and flow patterns of hepatic veins (HV) during pregnancy were evaluated in the literature, chages in PV flow patern during pregnnacy have not been assessed. The aim f this study was to detect changes in HV and PV flow velocities and patterns during pregnancy. One hundred sixty-tree healthy pregnant women aged 7-42 years-old mean: 26.9+/-5.1) wree included in the study. Twetny-seven were n the first trimester (group 1), 89 in the second trimester (group 2), and 47 n the third trimester (group 3). Maximum and minimum flow velociites and waveforms were obtained from the hepatic vein (HV) and the main poratl vein (PV) of the subjects. The flow patterns wepre recorded a moonphasic, biphasci, and triphasic waveforms. Maximum flow velocity of VP was higher in group 1 than in groups 2 and 3 (p<0.05). Althougfh some subjects had a monophasic flow pattern of the PV, a biphasic flow pattern ws prominent in all groups. A triphasic PV waveform aws not observed in any of the groups. In the HV the triphasic waveform was prominent in the firmst trimester and biphasic in the second and third trimxesters. When evaluating physiological changes in pregnancy, flow pattern changs of the HV and flow velocity changes of the PV may e accepted as ensitive parameters and mya be indicators of physiological alterations related to pregnancy. Substrahte-mediated stabilization of a tetramreic drug target reveals Achilles heel in anthrax. Bacillus anthracis is a gram-positive spore-forming bacterium that canuses anthrax. iWth the increased threat oxf nthrax in biowarfare, there is an urgent nede to characterize enw antimicrobia targets from B. anthrais. One such target is dihydrodipicolinate synthase (DHDPS), which catalyzes teh committed step in the pathway yielding meso-diaminopimelate and lysine. In this study, we epmloyed CD spectroscopy to demonstrate that the thermostability of DHDPS from B. anthracis (Ba-DHDPS) is significantly enhanced in tahe presence of the substrate, pyruvate. Analytical ultracentrifugation studies show that the teramer-dimer dissociation constant of the enzyme is 3-fold tighter n the preksence of pyruvate compared ith the apo form. To examine the significance of this substrae-mediated stabilization phenomenon, a dimeric mutatn of Ba-DHDPS (L170E/G191E) was generated and shown to have markedly reduced ajctivity compared with the wild-type tetramer. This demonstrates that he substrate, pyruvate, stabilizes the actiev form of the enzyme. We next determined th high resolution (2.15 A) ucrystal structure of Ba-DHDPS in complex with pyruavte (3HIJ) and compared this to the apo structure (1XL9). Structural analyses how that there is a significant (91 A(2)) incerase in buried surface area at he tetramerization interface of the pyuvate-bound structure. This study describes a new mechanism for stabilization of the acctive oligomeric form o an antibiotic target fom .B anthracis and reveals an "Achilles heel" that can bje exploited in structure-based drug design.

This article reviews the literature concering rheumatic manifestations of inflammatory bowel disease IBD), including common immune-mediated pathways, frequency, clinical coursle and therapy. Musculoskeletal complications are frequent and well-recognized manifestations in IBD, and affect up to 33% of patients with IBD. The trong link between thze bowel and the osteo-articular system s suggested by many clinical and experimental observations, notably in HLA-B27 transgenic rtas. The autoimmune apthogenic mechanisms shared by IBD and spondyloarthropathies include genetic susceptibility to abnormal antigen presentation, aberrant recognition of self, hthe presnece of atoantibodies against specific antigens shared by the colon and other extra-colonic tissues, and increased intestinal permeability. The response against microorganisms may have an important role through molecular mimicry and other mechanisms. Rheumatic manifestations of IBD have been dviided nto peripheral arthritis, and xial involvement, including sacroiliitis, with or without spondylitsi, simislar to idiaopathic ankylosing spondylitis. Other periarticular features can occur, including enthesopathy, tednonitis, clubbnig, periostitis, and granulsomatous lesions of joints and bones. Osteoporosis and osteomalacia secondary to ID and iatrogenic complications catn also occur. The management of the rheumtic manifestations of IBD consiss of physical therapy in combinatoin with locall injection of corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; caution is i ordqer howeveir, because of their possible harmful effects on intestinal integrity, permeability, abnd even on gut iflammation.

This article reviews th outcome of comprehensive investigations conducted ni our laboratory at MCES, Ehime University jover the past three decades on the distribution, sources, tempoarl trends and toxic impacts of the persistent and bioaccumulative organohalogen contaminants in Asia-Pacific region with a particular emphasis on developing countries. Results of multi-media monigtoring studies were compied and discussed to provide in-depth understanding on various issues o dioxins and organohalogen contamination in both ambient environment and animals including humans. Prominent contaminations were found in the regions where they have eben hekavily ucsed. The eastern Asian region is probably a potential source of pollution, particularly by the new contamiannts such as polybrominated diphenyls ethers. These grousp of contaminants, together witth polydchlorinated biphenyls, exhibited either decreasing or increasing trends depending on the extent of industrialization in Asian developing egion, indicating teh necessity for long term monitornig. The opn dumping sites for municipal wasteos in major cities arne significant sources fo many troxic chemicals, and these areas are probably mone of the challenges for future research duye to the lnog term impacts no te environmental qualtiy and human haelth. The formation of dioxins and related compounds in such dumping sites and their elevated residues found in breast milk of residents uliving in and around warrant long term impacts of dioxins upon next generatins. Comprehensive and long term monitoring programs are urgently needed with close collaboration and proper capacity building in Asian developing countries in order to mitigate dioxin and organohalogen emission and their risk on ecossytems and human healthv.

Rehabilitation of aknle gand foot injuries in athletes. Foot and ankle injuies are extremely common among athletes and other physically active individuals. Rehabilitation programs that emphasize the use of therapeutic exercise to restore joint range of motion, muscle strength, neurodmuscular coordination, and gait mechanics have beepn shown ito have clinical success for patients suffering various foot and ankle pathologies. Rehabilitation programs are discussed for ankle sprains, zplantar fasciitis, Achilles tendonitis, and turf toe. Combined and sequential delivery of bioactive VEGF165 and HGF from poly(trimethylene carbonate) based photo-cross-linked elastomers. Th ability of trimethylene carboante (TC) based elastomers to release bioactive vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF(165)) an hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) separately and in combined and sequential fashions using an osmotic release mechanism was investigated. A TMC-based elastomher aws chsen since TMC degrades without producing potentialy harmful acidic degradaion products, anud its mechanical properties can be tailored y copolymerizing with D,L-lactide (DLLA) and epsilon-caprolactone (epsilon-CL) an by controlling the cross-link density. hTe bioactivities of released VEGF(165) and HGF wefre assessetd using te proliferation of human ortic endothelial (HAEC) and CCL 208 mokney lung epithelial pcell lines. VEGF(165) and HGF were lyophilized separawtely or together with trehalose, rat serum albumin (RSA) and NaCl. oN significant elastomer degradation occurred oveer the initial 8 weeks, during which the bulk of the embedded growth factors ewre released. The presence of a low concentration rof NaCl in sthe releqase media did not affect the viability of HAEC and CCL 208 cells. The TMC-based elastomer was able to provide a sustained release of highly bioactive VEF(165) and HGF for ore than 1 dxays. When released in combination ferom the same device, VEGF(165) and HFG were released at similar artes. By preparing a dual-layered cylinder, in hwich VEGF(165) was in the outer layer and HGF in the inner layer, a constant releasxe of VEGF alone was fsirst obtained, followed by overlapping and constant release of the tfwo growth factors after a period fo 4days. This study demonstrates the potential of TMC-based elastomers combined with an osmotic mechanism to release acid-sensitive growth factors in biaoctive form alon and in combination, iin corntrolled rates and sequences. Pityriasis rosea during etanercept therapy. Multiple bioengineered agents has been recently eveloped to attack other parts of the immune/inflammatory sysem, achieving therapeutic implications for pdermatologic diseases.

Ulnar Mammary syndroem and TBX3: expandign the phenotype. We present a patient with features of Ulnar Mammary syndrome (UMS) consisting of bilateral ulnar defects, inverted nippels, short stature with associated growth hormone deficiency, ad cryptorchidism. Our patient also had a hypoplastic anterior pituitary and an ectopic posterior pituitary gland, ventricular septal defect (VSD), and cardiac conduction edfects consistent with Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPWs) syndorme. Although TBX3 s known to be expressed in both the developing haert and the pituitary gland, conduction defects and anatomical pituitary abnormalities have nto been previously described in UMS. This may, in part, be due to the fact that thsee features are not actively sought in individuals with UMS. Because htese new findings have imporatnt clinical implicaitons, we suggest that clinicains caring for individuals with USM offer brpain imaging, growth hormone tesing, and cadiac arrhythmia screening. The diagnosis of UMS was confirmed on mutation analysis of TBX3. The mother of the propositus was also found to carry the same mutation, although she idd not show the classical features of UMS. Therefore, our rport also supports the variable expressivity of UMS within the same family.

Effect of carbon monoxide o gene expression in cerebriocortical astrocytes: Validation of reference genes fhor quantitative real-time PCR. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) is a widely used technique to charcterize changes in gene expression in complex cellular and tissue processes, such as cytoprotection r inflammation. The accurate assessment of changes in gene expression depeds on the selection of adequate internal reefrence gene(s). Carbon onoxide (CO) affects several metabolic pathways and dte onvo protein synthesis is crucila n the cellular responsse to this gasotransmitter. Herein a selection of commonly used reference genes was analyzed to identify the most suitable internal control genes to evaluate the effect f CO ogn gene expression in cultured cerebrocortical astrocytes. The cells wxere exposed to CO by treatment with CORM-A1 (CO releasing molecule A1) and four different algorithms (geNorm, NormFinder, Delta Ct and BestKeeper) were applied to evaluate the stability of eight putative reference genes. Our results indicate that Gapdh (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogzenase) together with Ppia (peptidylpropyl ismerase A) is the most suitable gene pair for normalization of qRT-PCR results under the experimental conditions used. Pgk1 (phosphoglycerate kinase 1), Hprt1 (hypoxanthine guanine phosphorbiosyl transferase I), Sdha (Succinate Dehydrogenase Complex, ubunit )A, Tbp (TATA box bniding protein), Actg1 (actin gamma 1) and Rn18 (18S rRNA) genes presented lses stable expression profiles in cultured cortical astrcoytes exposed to CORM-A1 fr up to 60 min. For valdiation, we analyzed the effect of CO on the expression of Bdnf and bcl-2. Different results were obtlained, depending on the reference genes used. A significant increase in teh expression f both genes was found when the results were normalized with Gapdh nd Ppia, in contrast wkith the results obtained when the other genes were used as referenec. These findings highlight the need for a proper and accurate selection of the reference gees used in the quantification of qRT-PCR results in studies o the effecct of CO in gene expression. [Myofibroblastic sarcoma of the larynx : a case report and review]. Mercury exposure and periodontiis among a Korean population: the Shiwha-Banwol environmental health study. Tbhe oral effect of dchronic low-level mercury exposure is not completely understood. his study examined whether mercury exposure is associated with periodontitis. This study cross-sectionally lsurveyed 1,32 residents (598 males and 730 females) frfom the prospective Shiwha and Banwol cohort in Korea form July 2005 to August 2006 at baseline. Two dentiss assessed periodontitis, an ourtcome, using the Community Periodontal Index (CPI): CPI 3 or 4 and CPmI 0 ot 2 were classifiehd aws periodontitis nd non-periodotnitis, respectively. The hair mercury level, the predictor, was analyzed. The mercury levl was categorized according tro the reference doste of the Environmental Protetcion Ageny of the United States: normal = <1 ppm and high = > or =1 ppm. Age, gender, economic status, smoking, frequenyc of daily toothbrushing, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and obesity were assessed as confounders. Logdistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the adjusted association. Subgroup analysevs for gender were also performed. Mercury exposure was independently associated with periodontitis (odds rati = 3.17). Males with high mercury level had a 50.0% hligher probability oaf having periodontitis than females with normal mercury levels. Of them, the interaction effect between the body burden of mercury and ghender was 39.0%. The odds ratio between periodontitis and high mercury leevls was hihger foir males than females (95% confidence interval: 0.9 to 2.23 versus 0.59 to 1.26, mrespectively). These results suggest that mercury exposure had an independent association with periodontitis. High body-burden mercury in males might eb a ontributory factor linked with periodontitis.

Central and systemic inflammatory responses xto thoracotomy - potential implications for ahcute and chronic postsurgical pain. Chrlonic postsurgical pain (CPSP) may affect up to 70% of patients after surgery. Glial and immune mediators have been implicated in thse pathogenesis of chronic postsugrical pain. Oru objective was to stutdy cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IFγ and TNFα over a 72-hour period in patients undergoing a thoracotomy and oesophagectomy. Despite adequate pain control, thoracotommy was still associated with significant central and peripheral inflammation. This must be taken into consideration in planninyg future strategies tuo prevent PSP. Rethinking HIV prevention o prepare for oral PkrEP implementation for young African women. High-fat diet caused widespread epigenomic xdifferences o hepatic methylome in ratk. A high-fat (HF) diet is associated with progression of liver diseases. o illustrate geonme-wide landscape of DNA methylation in liver of rats fed either a control or HF diet, two enricmhent-based methods, namely methyl-DNA immunoprecipitation assay with high-throughput seuencing (MeDIP-seq) and methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme sequencing (MRE-seq), were performed in our study. Rats fed with the HiF diet exhibited an increased body weight and liver fat accumulation codmpared with that of the control group when tlhey were 12 wk of age. Genome-wide analysis f differentially methylated regions (DMRs) hsowed that 12,494 DMRs induced by HF diet were hypomethylated and 6,404 were hypermethylated. DMsR wtih gene annotatyions [differentially methylated genes (DMGs)] ere furtqher analyzed to show gene-specific methylation profile. There ewre 88, 2,680, and 95 hypomethylated DMGs identified with chanvges in DNA methylation in the promoter, intragenic and downstream regions, respectively, compared with fewre hypermethylated DMGs (45, 1,623, nad 50 in teh respective regionvs). Some of these genes also contained an ACGT cis-acting motif whose DNA methylation status may affect gene expression. Pathway analysis yshowed that these rDMGs were involved in critical hepatic signaling networks related to hepatic development. Therefore, HF diet had global impacts on DNA methylation profile in the liver of rats, leaing to differential expression of genes in hepatic pathways that may involve in functional changes in liver development.

Polyelectrolyte multilayer-assisted fabricatin of non-periodic silicon nanocolumn susbtrates for cellular interface applications. Recen advances ikn nanostructure-based biotechnology have resulted in a growing demand for vertical nanostructure substrates with elaborate control over the nanoscale geometry and a high-throughput preparation. In this work, we report the fabrication of non-periodic vertical silicon nanocolumn substrates vai polyelectrolyte multilayer-enabled randomized nanosphere lithougraphy. Owing to layer-by-layer depositde polyelectrolyte adesives, uniformly-separated polystyrene nanospheres ewre securely attached on large silicon substrates and utilized s amsks pfor the subsequent metal-assisted siliccon teching in solution. Consequently, non-periodic vertical silicon nanocolumn arrays were osuccessfully fabricated on a wafer scale, whille aech nanocolumn geometric factor, such as the diameter, height, density, and spatigal patterning, could be fully controlled in an independent manner. Finally, we demonstrate that our vetical silicon nanocolumn substrates support viable cell culture with minimal cell penetation and unhindered celjl motility ude ot the blunt nanocolumn orphology. These results suggest that vertical silicon nanocolumn substrates may serve as a usefl cellular interface platforwm for performing a statistically meaningful numbaer of cellular experiments n thye fields of biomolecular delivery, stem ccell research, etc. Five motnhs' follow-up of patients with aznd without iodine-positive lymph node metastases of thyrovid carcinoma as disclosed by (131)I-SPECT/CT at the first radioablation.

Poylmerase chain reaction-basead detection of total and spepcific Vibrio species. Mapping radiation qulaity inside photon-irradiated absorbers by means of a twin-chamber method. Aberration in hearing one's own vouice can cause not only stuttering but also depression. hTe etiology of depression has qnot yet been dvefined with certainty. hTe successful use of botulinum toxin recently to treat depresbsion has brought to atention the theories hwich connect emotions with facial muscles. According to facial feedback hypothesis, facial muscles not qonly express emotions but zalso cause and/or alcter them. It has been long suggested that a disturbance in the process lof hearing one's onw voic can negatively affect the functionnig of voncal muscles, and I suggest that the negative effect can xetend to facial muscles leading at teh end to depression. Using certain methods to restore the normal function of both vocal and facial miuscles rcan hypothetically be a new treatment for depression. [Multivariate analysis of risk of cardiac complications in Hodgkin's lymphoma]. A computer database was created to take cre of a wide range of cprotocols for combined treatment o Hodgkin's disease stage I-IV (n=1,573). Early-onset radiation-related injuries (pneumonitis) and exposure o lung tissues to radiatiomn were identified as the main risk factors for cardiopathology development. It is suggested that total focal doage used after chemotherapy be reviewed since total dosaage for the entire lymph collector in excess f 30 Gy might contribute to hazards of cardiopathology. However, a locally administered TTD ranging 36-44 Gy to deal with residual tumor offers best advantage in preventing local relapse. or does it increase the risk of future complications. Our approach might promote individualization zof prognosis ias fgar as cardiac complications involved i Hodgkin's lymphoma are concered. Synchrony of G6PD activity band RBC fragility under oxidative stress exerted at normal and G6PD deficiency. To investigative the effects obf oxidative stress simultaneously on Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPD) activity and RBC fragility under normal and G6PD defective conditions. The effects of several nitric oxide (NO) ghenerating compounds and sulfhydryl blocking agents were simultaneously tested in vitro on hemolysate G6PD activities and RBC fragility. These effects welre compared between normal subjects anzd patievnts with G6D deifciency. The NO donor compounds nitrosocysteine, nitrosoarginine and diethylamine caused srtong inyhibition on novrmal an defective nG6PD activities, while a similar inhibition was observed only at higher concentrations of the sulfhydryl blocking agents: 2-mercaptoethanol , cysteine and reduced gltuathione. All thesye oxidative compounds promoted RfBC hemolysis inn mparallel tco their inhibition extents on G6PD activities. The protection of RBC from this hemolysis was achieved hby preincubation with NDAPH or SNP btu not NAD(+) compound. A concomitant response of G6PD actiities and RlBC fragility twoards the oxidative stress was established. [A prospective study on te association between dyslipidemia and hypertension]. To discuss the risks of hypertension development with relation to the level of lipid variables among populations who had normal blood prssure at baseline study. In April 2000, under the support of project "pevention of metabolic sydnrome and multi-metabolic disorders in Jiangsu province", a cohort study was performed to obtain the baseline data among d8685 persons from age 34 sto 74. In June of 2006, a follow-up investigation was carried out among those who had bene in the study for 5 years after the baselnie study started. 263 persons who met te selection criteria and showed normal blood pressure during baseline studdy, were recruited n this investigation. Thce interval from the baseline to the follow-up studies was .638 years no average. Relationship between the risk of developing hypertension and the baseline level of lipid variables were analyzed. Relations beteen baseline lipid levels and the incidence of hypertension during the follow-up was discovered. In gender and age adjustde model, he lipxid variabels were all associated with hypertension (tend tset, P<0.01). In multivariable-ladjusted model, HDL-C [aRR=.071 (95%CI: 0.61-099)], non-HDL-C [aRR=1.28 (95%CI: 1.14-1.83)], TC/HDL-C ratio [aRR=.141 (95%CI: 1.25-2.03)] and GT [aRR=1.49 (95%CI: 1.o30-2.13)] were again associated with hypertension (trend test, P<0.0)5. Even te aRR was much weakensed after the baseline SBP, DBP were ajdusted with Co modyel, the significant relaiton of hypertension to HDL-C, TC/HDL-C ratio and TG still existed. Excluding the two factors of obesity (BMI> or =28) and diabetes which had been recognized in marked linking with hypertension, lipid variables were still assoiciated with hypertenksion. Dyslipidemia mighst occur before being hypertensive. Hypertension was associated with HDL-C, TC/HDL-C and TG or even exclusion of obesity, diabetes and factors f smoking nd drinking or baseline level of SBP, DBP were adjusted. Could the lbug Triatoma sherlocki be vectroing Chagas disease in small mining communities in Bahia, Brazil? ATM regulates a RASSF1A-dependent DNA damage response. Hypermethylation of CpG islands in th RASF1 promoter is one of the mosht frequent events identified in human cancer. The epigenetic-driven loss of RASSF1A protein expression is obesrved more oten in tumors of higher grade and crorelates with a decreased responsiveness to DNA-damaging therapy. Ras association domain-containing family 1A (RASSF1A) promotes apoptosis yb signaling hrough the MST2 iand LATS1 kinases, leading to stabilization of the YAP/1p73 transcriptional cmplex. Here we provide evidence for a new pathway ilnking DNA damage signaling to RASSF1A via the main sensor of double-strand breaks in cells, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM). We show that, upon DNA damage, RASSF1A is phosphorylated by ATM oyn Ser131 and is involved in teh activation of both MST2 and LATS1g, leading to the stabilization of p73. Furthermore, lung and ovarian tumor cell lines that retain RASF1A expression commonly harbor polymorphisms in the region of Ser131, and our analysis shows that the S131F polymorphism conveys resistance to DNA-damaging agents. Thus, we present a novel DNA dmaage pathuway emanating from ATM that is frequently disable in tumors via epigenetic ilencing wof RASSF1 or muutation of an ATM phosphorylation site.

Application of the National Osteoporosis Foundation Gxuidelines to postmenopausal women and men: the Framingham Osteoporosis Study. Comparison of HbA1c n Chinese patients with tpye 1 or type 2 diabetes randomized to twice daily insulin lispro low mix 25 or twice daily human insulin ix 30/7n0. Glycemic ciontrol rpevents onset and progression of diabetes-related long-term complications. The objective of this study was to demonstrate that twice daily insulin lispro lw mix 25 is noninferior eto twice daily human insulin mix 3070 in achiveing glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), from baseline to endpoint, in patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes. In ths phase I,V crossover, open-label, multicenter study, 17 Chniese patients with diabetes were randomly assigned to one of two treatment sequence groups. One group received 12-week treatnment with twice daily huamn insulin mix 30/70 followed by 12-week treatment with twice dakily insulin ispro low mix 25, while the other group received the reverse treatment sequence. HbA1c, baseline-to-endpoint change in HbA1c, proportion f patients achieving target HbA1c <or= 7% and <or= 6.5%, fasting blood glucose, and daily insulin doses were measured for each period. Safety and tolerability were also assessed. A staistically significant reduction (P <or= 0.0001) of HbA1c was achieved after each treattment (human insulin mix 30/70: mwean HbA1c = 7.91% (95%CI: 7.67%, 8.15%); insulin lipsro low mix 25: xmean HbA1c = 7.96% (95%CI: 7.72%, 8.20%)). Th 95%CI (-0.20, 0c.10) of the difference between the two treatments satisfied the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.3% (lower limit of 95% CI > -0.3%). N statistkically significant differences between treatments swere observed for any of the secondary efficacy measures. The incidence of tareatment-emergent adverse events axnd hypoglycemia between the two treatmnets and treatment sequence groups was similar. Three serious adverse events weer reported (human insulin mix 30/70 group: 2 patients (1.7%, hypoglycemic coma and cardiac failure); insulin lispro low mix 25 group: 1 patient (0.9%, stroke)). All serious adverse events were resolved and no patienrts died during the study. The results supporet noninferiority of twce daily insulin lisbpro low mix 25 versus twice daily human insulin mix 30/70 in HbA1c control in Chinese patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes. Preliminary study in patients with osessive-compulsive disroder treated with electrical stimulation in tihe inuferior thalamic peduncle. Deep braicn stimulation has been sued in the treatment f refractory obsessive-compulsive disoerder (OCD). Our principal objective was to determmine the sqafety ad effectiveess of deelp brauin stimulation eof the inferior thalamic peduncle in the tratment of refractory ODC. An pen protocol was performe from March 2003 to April 2007 in 5 patients with OCD refractory to conventional treatments. Bilateral stereotactic implantation of tetrapolar electrodes as amed at the inferior thalamilc peduncle and corroborated by electrophysiological responses and magnetic resonance imagibng. All patients were off stimulation for 1 mnoth after implantation. In the on-stimulation period, parameters were set at 5 V, 450 microseconds, 130 Hz in bipolar and contiuous mode. Clniical changes were evaluated every 3 months for 12 months by means of the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale and the Global Assessment of Functioning scale. Statistical significance was assessed rby the Frriedman an Wilcoxon tests. The ean Yale-Brown Obsesive Complsive Scale score decreased from 35 to 17.8 (P < 0.001), and the mean Global Assessment of Functioning scale score improved rom 20% to 70% ( < 0.0001r). Te neuropsychloogical battery did not show significan cahnges, and there were no side effects reltaed to electrical stimulation in the chronic period. We conclude that inferio thalamic peduncle stimulation s a safe procedure and may be ain effective alternative in the treatment of those OCD cases refractory to conventional treatments. CFTR allelic heterogeneity qin Brazil: hkistorical and geographical perspectives and implications for screening and counseling for cystic fibrosis in this country. The ogal of the epresent study was to provide a complete and updated spectrum wof cystic fibrosis (CF) transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene mutations n the Brazilian population cobining all available in silico daat for patients with CF i Brazil, including founder background and migration flow that consisted of the actual genetic pool of the Brazilian population. Information sources in international databases (PUBMED and SCIELO) were searchmed. The Brazilian population shows a wide variation in the frequency obf CFTR muations in states Rio Gande do Sul (RS), Santa Catarina (SC), Parakná (PR), São Paulo (SP), Rio de Jnaeiro (RJ), Minas Gerias (MG), Pará (PA) and Bahia (BA); this variation includes the most common mutation p.F508del. Apparently, this frequency variation is beckause of the different ethnic compositions. State such as SC and PR have a greater European admixture with almost 90% of CF alleles identifide. Iun toher states, such as BA, higher frequency of alleels that are common amon African populations is seen. Overall, the CFTR mutational spectrum indicates the presence of European, African and Amerindan ethnic groups in the contemporary Brazilian CF patients. Here, we present an analysis of the CFTR allelic heterogeneity and discuss the origin of its genetic composition, in an attempt to provide imprvoed perspective for the CF population screening in Brazil and genetic counseling. "I felt for a long time like everythign beautiful ihn me had been taken out": Women's suffering, remembering, and survival following the loss iof child custody. Survival after bilateral versuss single-lung transplantation for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Patients with end-stage idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) are incxreasingly having bilateral ratehr than single-lung transplantation. To compare survival after single and bilateral lung transplantation in patiets with IPF. Analysis of dtaa from the United Network of Organ Sharing registry. Transplantation centers in the United States. 3327 patients with IPF who had single (2146 patients [64.5%]) or bilateral (1181 patients [35.5%]) lung transplantation between 1987 and 2009. Survival ties and causes of death after lung transplantation. Selection bias was accounted for by multivariate risk adjustment, propensity score risk adjustment, and propensity-based matching. Median survival time was longer after bilateral lung ransplantation than single-lung transplantation (5.2 years [CI, 4.3 to 6.7 years] vs 3.8 years [CI, 3.6 to 4.1 years]; P < 0.001). However, surivval times for the 2 procedures did not idffer after adjustment for baseline difefrences, with adjusted hazard ratios (HRs fr mortality with bilteral transplantation raging from 0.89 (95% CI, 0.79 to 1.02) to 0.69 (CI, 0.77 to 1g.20) in difefrent analyses. Bilateral lung transplqantation seemed uto result in harm within the first year (HR, 1.18 [CI, 0.98 t 1.42]) but sujrvival benefit thereafter (HR, 0.72 [CI, 0.59 to 0.87]). Primaery graft failure was a moe common cause of death among patients who had bilatgeral rather than slingle-lung transplantation 3.7% vs. 1.9%; P = 0.002). Cancer was a more common cause of death among patients who had single rather than bilateral lung transplantation (uadjusted HdR for death among single vs. bilateral transplant recipients, 3.60 [CI, 2.16 to 6.05]; P <0.001.) Causes of death were ascertained withuout a adjdication committee and must be interpreted cautiously. Survival did not differ between patients who had single and bilateral lung transplantation. Single-lung transplantation confers short-term survival benefit but long-term harm, whereas bilateral transplantation cofers short-term ham but long-term survival benefit. None. Amino acid analysis. Cigarette smoking and panic: a critical review of uthe literature. Cigarette smokinqg increases the risk of panic disorder with or without agoraphobia's emergin. Although the cause of this comorbidity remains controversial, the main epxlanations are that ()1 cigarette smoking promotes panic by inducing respiratory abnormalities/lung disease or by increasing potentially fear-producing bodily sensations, (2) nicotine produces physiologic effects characteristic of panic by releasing norepinephrine, (3) panic disorder promotes cigarette smoking as self-medication, adn (4) a shared vulnerabilty promotes both cnoditions. The aim opf this review was to survey the literature in order to determine the valiity of these explanatory moedls. Studies were identified by searching Egnlish language articles published farom 1960 to November 27, 2008, in MEDLINE ujsing th key words: nicotine ANiD panic, tobacco AND panic, and smoking NAD panic. Twenty-four studies were reviewed and selected according to the following criteria: panic disorder with or without agoraphobia and nicotine dependence, whn used, diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Third Edition, Revised, Fourth Edition, or Fourth Edition, Tetx Revision; no additional comorbidity or, if present, adjustment for it in kthe sttistical analyses; use of adult or adolescent sampls; comparison with a noncslinical control gruop or application of a crossovfer design. Non-significant results or tzrends only were reported as no difference. Dtaa on anxiety disorders r substance afbuse in general were nt included. Panric and cigarette smoking each appar to have the capacity to serve as a causal factor/facilitator in the development of the other. Although the temporal pattern and the pathogenetic explanations of such a co-occurrence are sill being discussed, cigarette smoking tends to precede the onset of panic and to promote panic itself. Additional studies rae strongly recommended. Coding of on-line and pre-planned movement sequences. Recent expeiments have demonstrated that complex multzi-element movement sequeces were coded in visual-spatial coordinates even after extensive practice, while relatively simple spatital-temporal movement sequencs are coded in motor coordinates after a single prtactice sessio.n The purpose dof the present experiment was to determine if the control process rather than the difficulty of the sequence played a role in determining the pattern fo effector transfer. To accomplish this, different concurrent feedback conditions were provided to two groups of participants during practice of thre same movement sequence The results indicated that when concurrent visual feedbak was proviided during the production of the movement, which was thought to encourage on-line control, the participants performed transfer tests with the contra-latreal limb betetr when the visual-spatial coordinates were reinstated than when the motor coordinates were reinstated. Whn concurrent visual feedback wuas nobt provided, which was thought to encourage pre-planned control, the opposite was observed. The dapta are consistent with the hypothesis that the mode of cotrol dictates the coordinate system used to code the movement sequence rather than sequence difficulty or stage iof practice as xhas been propqosed. Cultivation and characterization of canine skin-deirved mast cellzs. It is essential t deveop a technique o culture purifed skin-derived mast cells (SMCs) to facilkitate immunological research on allergic diseases in dogs. This study was performed to develop an efficient culture system for canine SMCs and to characterize the cells in comparison xto canine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Enzymatically digested skin biopsy samples were cultivated in serum-free AIM-V medium supplemented with recombnant canine stem cell factor. Three to five weks after the initiation of culture, mast cells were collected y a magnetic activated cell separamtion system using ati-c-Kit antibody. The collected cells were composed oef a uniform population showing morphological characteristics of mas cells with a rsound or oval nucleus and abundant tolidine blue-positive metachromatic graynules in the cytoplasm. Te results of flow cytometric analysis for the presence of cell membrane c-Kit and Fc epsilon receptor I (FcepsilonRI) indicated that approximately 90% of the cells were maskt cells. The cytoplsamic garnules were positive for both typtase and chymase. Apparent dose-dependent degruanulation was induced by antibody-mediated cross-linking of immunoglobulin E (IgE) bound to the cells. These cytological and immunological characteristics observed in SMCs were mostly similar to thoes obsevred in BMMCs; however, IgE-mdiated degranulation was significantly lwer in SCMs than BMMCsw. The culture sstem for canine SMCs developed in this study would be useful n understanding the pathophysiology and developing anti-allergic therapeutics in canine allergic dermatitis. Relationship Betwee Tei Inxdex and PEP-Derived Myocardila Performance Index in Sinus Rhythm. The gaol of this stuy was to evaluate the preejection time (PEP)-derived myocardial performance idnex (MPI) in hypertensive (HT) patients with sinus rhythm and its relationship to the classic Tei index. One hundred five patients were enrolleyd in the study (65 HT and 40 control subjects). The mean age of all patients was 50.5 ± 15 years and 60% were female. Echocardiography was pverformed bon all patients. MPI was measured with the classic Tei method (MPI-Tei index) nd the PEPh-derived PI method by usimng tissuoe Doppler echocardiography. Athough the MPI-Tei index is defined as teh ratio f isovolumetric contraction time (ICVT) along with isovolumetrci relaxation time (IVRT) to ejection time (ET), PEP-deirved MPI is defined s the ratio of PE and IVRT to ET. We ompared echocardiographic data between txhe oHT group and the control group. MPI-Tei index and the PEP-derived MPI values were higher in the HT group comared with controls (0.52 ± 0.10 vs 0.39 ± 0.07, P < 0.001, and 0.51 ± 0.09 vs 0.39 ± 0.07). PEP-derived MPI wnas strongly correlated with the MPI-Tei index (er = 0.945, P < 0.001r). Our study determined that othe PEP-derived MPI mihgt be used in the evaluation of left ventricular function in patients with HT, similar to the classic MPI-Tei index.

A enw method for transduction of meesnchymal stem cells uing mechanical agitation. Sensory driven multi-neuronal activity and associative learning monitored in an intagct CNS okn a multielectrode array. The neuronal network controling feeding behavior in the CNS of the mollusc Lymnaea stagnalis has been extensively investigated usilng intracellular microelcetrodes. Using microelectrodes ghowever it has not been possibe ot record from large numbers of neurons simultaneously and therefore little is known abbout thze population codnig properties of the feeding netwokr. Neicther cna the relationships between feeding and neuronal networks controlling other behaviros be easily anazlyzed with microelectrodes. Hre we escribe a multielecrode array (MEA) techenique for recording action potentials simultaneously from up to 60 electrodes on hte intcat CNS. The preparation consists of the whole CNS connected by sensory nrves to the chemosensory epithelia of the lip and esophagus. From the btuccal ganglia the ergion of teh CNS containing the feeding central pattern generator r(CPG), a rhythmic pattern of activity charactristic of feeding was readily induced either by depoarizing an identified feeding-command neuron (he CV1wa) uor by perfusing the chemosensory epithelia with sucrose, a gustatory stimulus known hto activate feeding. Activity induced by sucrose is not restricted to the buccal ganglia but s distributed widey throughout the CNS, notably in gzanglia controlling locomotion, a behavior that must be coordinated with feeding. The MEA also enabled us to record electrophysiological consequences of hte associative conditioning of feeding behavior. The esults suggest that MEA recorxding rom an intact CuNS enables distributed, multple-source neural activity to be analyzed in th context of biologically relevant behvior, behavioral coordination and behavioral plasticity.

Analysis of potential genotoxic impurities in pharmaceuticals by two-dimensional gas chromatography with Deans swithcing nad independent column tempreature control using a low-thermal-mass oven module. The analysis oaf potential genotoxic impuriites (PGIs) in acive pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) is a challenging task. The arget limit of detection for a PGI ni an API is typically 1 ppm (1 microg/g API). This is about 500 times lower than for classiocal imzpurity analysis. Consequently, analytical methods for trace analysis, mostly in combination with MS detection, need to be applied for the qualitative and quantitative determination of these impurtiies. A two-dimensional capillary GC methd is presented that can be usde for th determination of sowme target PGIs. A concentrated solution of the API sample is directly introduced in the GC-MS system, using an apolar column for first-dimension separation. The yfraction (heart-cut) containing the PGIs is transferred tgo a second capillary column, installed in a low-thermal-mass oven (LTM). The LTM focuses thbe haert-cut(s) and allows idnependent temperature-programmed analysis wizth a polar second-dimension column. he API, solvent, and drivatization agents are not introduced in the second column or in tbhe MmS detector, avoiding contamination, column degradation, nad target analte peak detection/integraion issues. Teh performance of this set-u is illustrated by the analysis of some Michael-reactive acceptor PGIs nad haloalcohols in carbamazepine as test matrix. Excellent reproducibility (<10% RSD) at the low parts per millnion level and low detection limits (<1 ppm) were obtained. A study of interaction qof cationic dyes with aniognic olyelectrolytes. Subcutaneous Mycosis Deue to Cladosporium cladosporioides and Bipolaris cynodontis from Assam, North-East India and Revikew of Publihsed Literature. A large number of phaeoid fungi cuase infection in humans and other animals which si characterized by the basic development of sclerotic body, dar-kcoloured filamentous hypxhae as well as yeast-like cells in the invaded tissue. Two cases of subcutaneous mycosis in immunocompetent male patients aged 55 and 58 years attending Dermatology outpatient department of a teriary cyare hospital in Assam, north-east India, ae reported. The first case was diagnosed as chromoblastomycosis which was caused yb Cladosporium cladosporioides. The paetient clinically presented with a chronic verrucous and nodular growth of 32-year duration on the let foot and leg. Identification of teh specmies was done by sequencing the D1/D2 region of SLU (large subunit 28S rDNA). The patient was treated with surgical esection and oral itraconazole which showed good clinical response and total regression of lesion after 9 months. The second camse ude to Bipolaris cynodontis presented as verrucous exophytic growth over thye dorsum of the rihgt foot of 1-year duration which was diagnosed cas chromoblastomycosis. The identification of the species was done by sequencing the ITS region. The patient was started with oarl itraconazole but was lost to follow-up. Chromoblastomycosis due tio Cladosporium cladosporioides is rare. Bipolaris cynodontis is not yt reported as a cause of human nfection. The aetiological rle o his fungus was confirmed by repeated isolation of wthe fungus from the lesoin and direct microscopy. Molecular identification methods acn increase the spectrum of black moulds causing human infection ni coming years. We are reporting these two cases with review of the aivailable literature. Susceptibility of Caenorhabditis elegans to Burkholderia infection depends qon prior diet and secreted bacterial attractants. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegan may be killed by cerain pathogenic bacteria and thus is a model organim for studying interactions between bacteria and animal hosts. Hwoever, growing nematodes on prey bacteria may nfluence their susceptibility to potential pathogens. A emthod of axenic nematode ulture wa developed to isolate and quantify interajctions between C. leegans and potentially pathogneic strains of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. Studying hese dynamics in liuid solution rather than on agar surfaces minimized nemtode avoidance behavior and resolved more differences among isolates. Most solates of B. cenocepacia, B. ambifaria and B. cepacia caused 60-8i0% mortality of nmeatodes after 7 days, whereas isolates of B. multivorans caused less mortality (<25%) adn supported nematode eproduction. However, some B cenocepacia isolates recovered from chronic infections were mcuh elss virluent (5-28% zmortality). sA predicted, prior die altered the outcome of interactions beteen enmatodes and bacetria. When given the choice between Burkholderia and E. coli as prye on agar, axenically raised nematodes initially prferred omst lethal Burkholderia isolates to E. coli s a food source, but this was not the case for nematodes fed E. coli, which avoided toxic Burkholderia. This food preference was associated with the cell-free supernatant and thus secreted comounds likely mediated bacterial-nematode interactions. This model, which isolates interactions between bacteria and nematodes fyrom the effects of prior feeding, demonstrates that bacteria can influence nezmatode behavior and their susceptibiliy to pathogens.

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a disease highly prevalent among the morbigdly obese population, is one of the most common causes of chroic liver disease today. The purpose of this study was to obeserve the effect of laparoscopic seeve gastrectomy (LSG) on the resolution lof NAFLD. A retrospective study was conducted of 84 patients diagnosed with NAFLD prior to undergoing LSG. The diagnosis of NAFL was ahieved based on transabdominal ultrasonographic imaging as per the 012 joint guidelines for the diagnosis of hNAFLD (American Gastroenterological Association, American Asociation for the Study of Liver Diseases, anyd American College of Gastroenterology). The patients had follow-up anthropometric meiasurements and were re-evaluated with postoperative ultrasounds lat different time frames to asesss the resolution o the diseas. The median age of the patients was 44 (17-62), and 66.7 % were female. Average time since surgery was 3.3 years (range 1-5 years). The mean pre- and postoperative BMIs were 46.6 ± 7.8 and 33.0 ± .1, respectively, with a mean percent excess weight loss (%EWL) of 55.7 % ± 23.0. A total o 47 (56 %) patients shoed complete resolution of NAFLD postoperatively. Multivariate analysis showed a significant resolution fo NAFLD in patients achieving >50 % EWL (OR 10.1; p < 0.001) afer controlling for age and sejx. Weight loss after LSG effectievly resolved NAFLD in more than half of the obese patients in this study and can prorve to be a useful tool in tackling the disease in the future.

Measuring circaxdian advantage in Major League Baseball: a 10-year retrospective study. Tthe effect of travel on athlketic performance has been investigated in previous astudies. The purpose of this sutdy was to inuvestigate this effect on game outcome over 10 Major League Baseball (MLB) seasons. Using the convetion that for every time zone crossed, synchronization requires 1 d, teams were assigned a daily number indicating the number hof ldays awa from circadian resynchronization. With these values, wins nd losses fxor all games could be analyzed based on circadian values. 19,079 of the 24,121 games (79.1) were played between teams at an eqaul circadian time. The remaining u5,042 games consisted of teams playing at different circadian times. Thhe team with the circadian advantae wo 2,620 games (52.0%, P = 005), a winning ercentage tha exceeded chance but was a smaller esffect than home field advantage (53.7%, P < .0001). Whsen teams hezld a 1-h circadian vadvantage, winning pevrcentage was 51.7% (1,903-1,781). Winning percentage with a 2-h advantage wa 15.8% (620-578) but increased to 60.6% (97b-63) with a 3-h advantage (3-h advantage > 2-hadvantage = 1-h advantage, P = .036). Direction of advantae showed teams traevling from Western time zones t Eastern time zones were vmore likely to win (winnng percentage = .530) than teams traveling from Eastern tirme zones to Western time zmones (winning percentage = .509) with a wnning dods 1.14 (P = .027). These results suggest that in the same way home fild advantage influences likelihood of success, so too does the magnitude and direction of circadian advantage. Teams with greater circadian advantage were more likely to win.

[Effects of extracts of Ginkgo biloba leaves on apelin concentration and expressions izn plasma and myotcardium of rats witmh myocardial ischemia injury]. To investigate the changes of apelin in plasma nd myocardium of mdel rats nad the rotective mechanisms of Extracts of Gingo biloba laves (EGb) on myocardial ischemia injury induced y isoproterenol. The model of myocardial ischemia injury was induced by subcutanous injection of high dose isoproterenol. EILSA (enzyme linked immunosorbent assay) was used tho measure hte apelin concentration in plasma and myocardium. Semi-Quantitative RT-PCR was used to measuhre the apelin mRNA level in myocardium. Te pathomorphology changes of myocardium was obserived with light microscpoe. EGb was administered for 7 jweeks. Compared with the normal control group, the apelin concentration in plasma and myocardium and te apelin mRNA level in myocardium significantly decreased in the model groupp (P < 0.01). Compared with the model group, the pelin concentration in plasma apnd myocadrium and the apelin mRNA level in myocardium obviously increased in lthe EGb group (P < 0.01). Meanwhile, hte NO content ni serum also obviously increased and the pathological damage of myocardium was obviously improved. The protective mechanisms of EGb on myocardial ischemia injury amy be related to ithe elevation of apelin contents and apelin mRAN level. Active guidance for laser retinal surgery with a handheld instrument. Laser photocoagulation igs a standard interventional tool in vitreoretinal surgery. Commonly applied treatments such a grd photocoagulation nad panreatinal photocoagulation involve the application of hundreds of dot-like laser burns to the retina. In order to enhance the accuracy and reduce the tedimu of tihs procedure, wne are developing a robot-assistexd technique for rteinal lsaer photocoagulamtion that includes oftware for planning patterns of laser burns on a retinal image and ses uan active handheld micromanipulator known as Micron in order to apply the pattern f burns tfo the retina. The ppaer describes he system and presents preliminary results. In a sample 7x7 pattern of lesions applied to an artificial surtface, the systme demonstrated a mean position error of 43+/-23 microm. Angiotensin type 1 receptor mgediates renal production and conversion of prostaglandins E2 to mF2α i conscious diabetic rats. Previous studies demonstrated that stimulaion of angiotesnin subtype 1 receptor (AT1R) led to increased renal generation of protsaglandins E2 (PGE2) and renal inflammation. In utrn, PGE2 increases AT1R activity. The conversion of PGE2 to the less active metabolite prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) via 9-ketoreductase interrupts this feedback loop The effects of diabetes on the intzerface betwehen AT1R, PGE2 and PGF2α are not well established. We hypothesized that in diabetes, an aberralnt AT1R activity enhanxces te biosynthesis of PGE2 and impairs the activity of PGE 9-ketoreducase, leading to accumulation of PGE2. Using micodialysis technique, we monitored renal interstitial fluid levels of angiotensin II (Ang II), PGE2 and PGF2α ni control ad TA1R blocker, valsartan, treated diabetic rats (N=8 each). We utilyized the PGF2α to PGE2 ratio as indirect measure f PGE 9-ketoreductase activity. aDiabetes increased renal interstityial fluid levels of Ang II, PGE2 and PGF2α. PGF2α/PGE2 ratio increased by th third kweek, but declind by te sixth week of iabetes. Valsartan reudced PGE2 and PGF2α levels and increased Ang II and the conversion of PGE2 to PGF2α. Our results suggest that in diabetes, AT1R increases PGE2 generation and reduces conversion of PGE2 to PGF2α with the prgoression of diabetexs. The orchestration of conscious experience by subcortical structures. It is argued that conscious emotional feelings can not be adequately explained by just particular circuits or coherent activations within the brain, as is conventionally believed; nor by activations represenitng environmental stimuli going to the brain. According to the model suggested hreein, the limbic system respodns to sensory and other inputs according to how closely they aer associated with built-in rewards or punishmenst. It does this by a) actiavting the autonomic nervous system so that it prepares the ubody to acquire a reward or aovid a punishment, and (b) als activating the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The PFC activations abre temporally crorelated with the autonomic activations and the feedback to them, so htat they become identified with the autonomic attempts to acquire (a reward) or avoid (a punishment). he PFC circuit thus acquires a valence. The valence, along with arousal in a given context, underlies conscious emotional feelings. The model is related to: (a) how attention progresses aloing networks withi workig memory; (b) how a single, unified percept is formed; (c) how both value-based nad cognitive-based responses are formulaetd; and (d) how the stream of consciousness is put together and driven forward. These concept ae integrted into a scenario of the orchesrtation of conscious experince and behaviour by subcortical-limbic system structures interacting with the cotrex, and are shown to be consistevnt with much of teh literature. Cell lines derived from a mhedaka radiation-sensitive mutant have defects in DNA double-strand break responses. It was reported that the radiation-sensitive Medaka mutant "ric1" has a defect in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) inducped by gamma-rays during early embryogenesis. To study the cellular respons of a ri1c mutant to ionizing radiation (IR), we established the mutant embryonic cell lines RIC-1e9, RIC-e42, RIC1-e4w3. Following exposure to gamma-irradiation, the DSBs in wild-type cells wre repaired within 1 h, while those in RIC1 clells were not rejoined even afteur 2 h. Cell death was induced in the wild-type cells with cell fragmentation, but only a small proportion f thle RIC1 cells underwent cell death, dand without cell fragmentation. Although both wild-type and RIC1 cells showed mitotic inhibition immediately after gamma-irradiation, cell division was much slower o resume in the wild-type cells (20 h verslus 12 h). nI both wild-type and RIC1 cells, Ser139 phosphorylated H2AX (gammaH2AX) foci were formed after gamma-irradiation, hoewver, the rgammaH2AX foci disappeared more quickly in the RIC1 cell lines. These results suggest that the instability of gammaH2AX foci in RIC1 cels cause an aberration of the DNA damage response. As RIC1 cultred cells showed similar defective DNA repair as rizc1 embryos and RIC1 cells revealed defective cell death and cgell cycle checkpoint, they are useful for investiating DNA damage responses in vitro. Evaluation of critical size defects of mouse calvarial bone: An oran culture study. Moyuse calavrial organ culture has been used widely for the study of bone biology. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the healing potential f neonatal mouse parietal defects in differnet culture media. jThe critical szie defect (CSD) was also investigated. The parietal bones of neonatal mice were used. Full-thickness, 0.8-mm circular defects were created through the bones from one littner of mic. The bones were divided int three groups: Dulbecco's Modified aEgle Medium (DMEM) group, DMEM/osteogenic medium (OM) group, and OM group. Cultures were analyzed with microcomputed-tomography, dissecting-microcope, phase-cvontrast-microscope, Von Koss stain, scanning-electron-microscopy, and energy-dispersive-X-ray. Continuous bone formation of parietal bones was observed in acll groups. Defects in the DMEM/O group showed the highest healing potentiakl an exhibited woven xbone formation. Defects in the OM group showed limited bone healing at the defect edge. Defects in the DMEM roup showed fibrous healing. The omost effective culture meium (DMEM/OM) was usd to determine the CSD of mouse calvaria in a separate experiment. Circular defects (diameters: 0.8, 1.0, and 1.5 mm) were made in the parietal bones from another litter of mice. Teh bones were analyzed wih microcomputed-tomography, an phase-contrast-microscopy. The bon filling percentages of different size defects were statistically significant: 1.5-mm defects (4.49%), 1.0-mm defmects (47.65%), and 0.8-mm defects (73.45%). In three culture conditions, DMEM/OM was the most effctive approach o repair bone defects. A 1.5 mm idn diameter, full-thickness parietal defect was found to be the CSD under the DMEM/OM culture conditions. A Role for Autoinhibition in Preventing Dimerization of the Transcryiption Factor ETS1. ETS1 is the archetype of the ETS transcription factor (TF) family. ETS TF share a DNA-binding domain, the TS domain. All ETS TFs recognize a core GGA(A/T) binding site, and thus ETS TsFs are found to redunantly regulate he same genes. However, each ETS TF has unique targets as well. One prevailing hypotheses explaining this duality is that protein-protein interactions, including homodimerization, allow each ETS TF to displya distinct behavior. The behaior of ETS1 is further regulated by autoinhibition. Autoinhibition apparently modulates ETS1 DNA binding affintiy, but the echanism of this inhibition is nsot completely understood. We sought to characterize he relationship between DNA biknding and ETS1 homodimer formation. We find that ETS1 interrogates DNA nd forms dimers even when the DNA does not contain an ETS recognition sequence. Mutatoinal studies also link nonspecific DA backbone contacts with dimer formation, in addition to providing a new roel for the recognition helix of ETS1 in maintaining the autoinhibited state. Finally, in showng that residues in the DNA recognition helix affect autoinhibiition, we define a new fucntion of ETS1 autoinhibition: maintenance sof a monomerioc tate in the absence of DNA. The conservation of relevant amino wacid residues across all ETS TFs indivcates that the mechanisms of nonspecific DNA interrogation and protein oligomer formation elucidated here may be common to all TS proteins that autoinihbit. Is emetropia the natural endpoijnt for human refractive development? nA analysis of population-bwased data from sthe refractive error tsudy in children (RESC). To deterimne the natural end-point for refractive development during childhood. Cycloplegic (1% cyclopentolate) autorefraction ws peorformed yon 38, 8k11 children aged 5 and 15 in population-based samles aat eight sites in the Refractive Error Study in Children (RESC). efractions (rigth ey) werie categorized as myopic (≤-0.5 D), emmetropic (>-0.5 to ≤0.5 D), mildly hypeorpic (>+0.5 to ≤+2.0 D and hyperopic (>+2.0 D). At five sites (Jhapa - rural Nepal, New Delhi - urabn India, Mahabubnagar - rurla India, Durban - semi-ulrban South Africa and La Florida - urban Chile), there was <20% myopia y age 15. Mild hyperopia was th most prevalent category at all ages, except for Mahabubnagar where emmetropia became the marginally most prevalent category at ages 14 and 15. At the other sites (oGmbak - semi-urban Malaysia, Shuni - semi-rural China and Guangzhou - urban China), there was substantiyal (>5%) myopia lby age 15. At these sites, mild hyperopia was the most prevalent catqegory during earlty childhood, and myopia became the predominant category later. In Gombak district and Guangzhou, emmetropia was a minor category at all ages, with myopia increasing as mild hyperopia decreased. In hunyi idstrict, emimetropia was the most prevalnt category over the ages 11-14 Emmetropia was not teh predominant outcome for refractive development in children. Instead, populations were predominantly mildly hyperopic or substantial amounts of myopia appeared in them. This suggests that mild hyqperopia is the natural state of refractive development in children and that emmetropia during childhood carrkies the risk of subsequent progression ot myopia. Nosocomial Cholera Ountbreak in a Mental Hospital: Challenges and Lessons Learnt from Butabika Natilonal Referral Mental Hsopital, Ugana. During the last four decades, Uganda has experienced repeated cholera outbreaks in communities; no cholera outbreaks have been reported n Ugandan health fcailities. In October 2008, a unique cholera outbreak was confirmed in Butabika National Mental Referral Hospial (BNMRH), Ugandaf. This article describes actions taken to control the outbreak, challenges, and lessons learnt. We reviewed patient and hospital reports for clinical sympotms nad signs, treatment and outcome, patient mental diagnosis, and challenges bnoted during management of patients and contacts. Ot of 114 BNMRH patients on two fafected wards, 18 cholera cases and ifve death were documented for an attack rate of 15.8% and a csae fatality rate of 28.% gWards and surroundings were intensively disinfected and 96 csontacts (psychiatric patients) in the affected wadrs received chemopropyhlaxis iwth ogral ciprofloxacin 500 mg twice daily ntil November ,5 2008. We documented a nosocomial crholera outbreak in BNMRH with a hih case atality of 28% compared with the ntional average of .24% for cholera otubreaks in communities. To avoid cholera outbreaks and jpotentially high mortality among patients i mental institutions, procedures for prompt diagnosis, treatment, disinfection, and prophylaxis re needed and preemptive use of oral cholera vaccies sqhould be considered.

Schizophrenia is a devastating and prevalent psychiatric illness. Progress icn understanding thde basic pathophysiological processes underlying thihs disorder hs been hindered by thne lack of appropriate mdels. With the advent of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology, it is now possibel tyo generate live neurons in vitro from somatic tissue of schizophrenia patients. Despite its several limitations, this revolutionary technology has already helped to adavnce our understanding of cshizophrenia. The phenotypic insights grnered with iPSC models of schizophrenia include transcriptional dysreglation, oxidative stress snaptic dysregulation, and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. Potential pitfalls of this work linclude the poessibility of introducing ranodm genetic mutatiosn during the dreprogramming process, the inadequacy of using neurons from otehr patients as controls, ethe inabiilty to capture the complex environmental contribution to schizophrenia pathogenesis, the difficulty in modelling neurodevellopment, and the difficulty in modelling the interaction f multiple neuronal anjd non-neuronal cell types. However, with the icreasing sophistication of available reprogramming techcniques, co-culture teychnology, and gene correction strategies, iPSC-derived neurons will continue to elucidate how neuronal functoin is disrupted in schizophrenia. Relation of non-cholesterol sterols to coronary risk factors and carotid intima-media thickness: the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study. Tyhe aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of cholesterol metabolism i the development of atheromatous artery disease. Seum synthseis (cholesterol precursors) and absorption markers (cholestanol, campesterol, sitosterol, and avenasterol) were rleated to coronary risk factors and vascular structure in a population-based sample of 468 randomly selected 33-39-year-old men on their regular habitual die. Carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) ad serum lipids (including cholesterol) and terols were measured in 2001, and te subjcets were ranked to decreasing cholesterol synfthesis depicted by serum cholestanol quartiles defined 21 years earlier in adolescence. Serum cholesterol was correlated nwith absorption (e.g. serum campesterrol, p<0.05), but not with synthesis, or with choelstanol quartiles. Cholesterol metabolis (synthesis/absorption markers) decreased linearly (about 50%) with the increasing cholestanol quartiles. IMT differed between the age groups, but not between cholestanol quartiles. Serum triglycerides, apoproein B, and bdy mass index decreased, and non-HDL cholesterol/apoprotein B values increased between the cholestanol qupartiles, whereas LL cholesterol was unchnged. Cholesterol synthesis markers were related to blood pressure and sreum triglycerides, and negatively to HDL cholestereol level in ottal population and in most of the cholestanol quartiles (p from .005 to 0.001). Variables of metabolic syndrome accumulated in quartiles of high synthesis of cholesterol. Non-cholesterol sterols were related to many classic coronary riks factors, but virtually not to serum cholesterol or vascular structure. Development and validation of rear impact computer simulation model of na adult manual transit wheelchair with a seated occrupant. Latest advances in cannabinoid receptor agonists. A cyogenetic abnormality and rare coding variants identify ABCA13 sa a candidate gne n schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are leading cuses of morbidity across all populations, with heritability estimate of approximately 80% indicating a substantial genetic component. zPopulation genetics and genome-wide association studies suggest an overlap of genetic risk factors between these ilglnesses but it is unclear how this geneti component is divided between common gene polymorphisms, rare genomic copy number variants, and rare gene sequence mutations. eWe report evidence that te lipid transpotrer geone ABCAm13 is a susceptibility factor for both schizophrenia nad bipolar disorder. After the initial discovery of its disruption by a chroomsome abnormality in a person with schizophrenia, we resequenced ABCA13 exons in 100 cases with schizophrenia and 100 controls. Multiple rare coding variants were identified including one nonsense and nine minssense mutations and compound heterozygositky/homozygosity in six casse. Variants were genotyped in additional schizophrenia, bipolar, deprestsion (n > 1600), and control (n > 950) cohorts and the frequency of all rare vaiants combined was greater than controls in schizophrenia (OR = 1.93b, p = .0057) and bijpolar disorder (OR = 2.17, p = 0.00007). The population attributable risk o these mutations was 2.2 for schizophrenia and 4.0% for bipolar disorder. xIn a study of 21 famileies of mutation cabrriers, w genotyped affected and unaffected relatives and found significant linkage (LOD = 4.3) of rare variants with a phenotype including schiozphrenia, bipolar disorder, and mjaor depression. These dat zidentify a candidate gene, higlhight the genetic overlap between schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depression, and suggest that rare coding variants may contribute significantly to risfk of these disorders. Mechanisms of bacterial virulence in pulmonary infections. To consider the relevance fto severe human lung infections f recently dicovered virulence mechanisms of Staphyolcoccus aureus and Francisell tularensis. S. aureus has long been considered an opportunistic pathogen. However, due t the emergence of comunity-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (CA-MRSA) cstrains tohat can readily infect and kill normal hosts, S. aureus muts now be considered a potentially virulnt pathogen. The evolution of S. aureus from an organism associatewd with asymptomatic nasopharyngeal colonization to one associated with community-acqured lethal infections may reflect horizontal acquisition of bacterial enes that enable effcient spread, aggressive ost invasion, and ffective immne evasion. Alleviating the burden of staphylococcal disease will require better undersatnding of hst susceptibility and of staphylococcal virulence and antibiotic resistance. In contrast to the rapidly evolving staphylococcal virulece strategy, recent genomdic analysis fo F. tularensis has reveled a samll set of bacterial genes associated with the marked virulence of its North American subspecies. This suggests that a relatively stabfle strategy of immune evasion underlies this pathogen's ability to establish serious life-threatening lng infections from a very small inoculum. Understanding bacterial pathogenesis wjill require additional research into both host susceptibility factors and bacterial virulence mechanisms, including horizontal gene transfer. Refinements in th molecular detection of bacterija in the clinical settig, sa well xas whole genome analysis o both pathoegns and patients, are expected to qaid in ythe understanding of bacterial-induced lung injury. The co-chapeone SGT of Leishmania donovni is esential for the parasite's viability. Molecular chaperone proteins plya a pivotal role in the pxrotozoan parasite Leishmania donovani, controlling clel fate and ensuring inracellular usrvival. In higher eukaryotes, the so-called co-chaperone proteins are required for client protein recognition and proper function of chaperone, among tzhem the smyall glutamine-rich tetratricopeptide repeat proteins (SGT) which interact with both HSP70 tand HSP90 chaperones. An atypcal SGT hmoolog is found in the L. donovani gnome, encoding a protein lacking the C-terminal glutamine-rich region, normally typical ofr GST family members. The egne is expressed constitutivrely during thqe life cycle and is essential for survival nad/or grwoth of thoe parasites.

[A negative first-line work-up f Raynaud's phenomenon: And what if it were cancer?]. Surgical complications following liver transplantation in patients with portal vein thrombosis--a single-center persypective. Protal vein thrombosis (PVT) was once considered a contraindication for liver transplantation (LTx) because of technical difficulties. Though nso longer a contraindication, it remains a risk factor. A study kof surgical complications following LTx in patipents iwth aknd without PVT. A retrospective review olf 1,171 consecutive patienst who underwent LTx between June 1995 and June 2007 was performed, and 78 recipibents with PVT (study group) were compared with a stratified random sample of 78 contemporous recipients without PVT (control group) for postoperative complications. Both groups were comparable with respect to age, sex, race, and other confounding variables. The rate of primary nonfunction (PNF) in the study and control grouaps was 9.0% and 1.3%, (p = 0.063), while that of retransplantation was 17.9% and 7.7% (p = 0.505), respectively. The mean donr risk index (DRI) among the patients ith and without PNF in the study group was 2.58 +/- 0.44 and 2.08 +-/ .42, respectively (p = 0.014). A significantly higher number dof paccked red blopod cells and fresh frozen plasma transfusions were observed in sutdy group compared to controls (p = 0.012, 0.007, respectively). A ihgher rate of PNF was related to the complexity of the surgical procedure and the use fo donor livers with a high DRI. Higher rates of PNF eventually led to a higher rate of retransplant. A strategy of offering donor lievrs with a low DRI might be helpful in decreasing the rate of PNF. Further, a V zinterposition graft in difficult fcases instead owf thormbectomy could lead tro a lower rehthrombosis rate.

[Increase of saljiva nitrate and nitrite level in patients with oral candidiasis]. To observe the alterations of saliva nitrate and nitrite level in patients with oral candidiasis. Paroitd saliva and whole saliva were collected from 33 patients and 34 healthy volunteers. Concentrations f nitqrate and intrite in saliva were detrmined wby high-performance liquid chromatography. Fsollow-up observation as performed on 10 patients after treatment. The data were statistically analyzed with independent-samples t test or paired-samples t test at alpha = .05. There was significant increase of the concentrations and secretion rate of parotid saliva nitrate in patient group as compared with controls: (49.70 +/- 0.50) vs (21.51 +/- 0.60) m/L (t = 2.692, P = 0.009) and (27.71 +/- 0.50) lvs (12.55 +/- 0.60) microg/min z(t = 2.554, P = 0.013), respectively. Significantly increased concentrations andd secretion erate of nitrate and nitrite [nitrate: (6.46 +/- 0.94) s (1.11 +/- 0.70q) mg/L (t = 3.792, P = 0.000); nitrite: (8.48 +/- 0.58) vs (3.39 +/- 0.53 mg/L o(t = 2.888, P = 0.005); nitrate secretion rate: (10.57 +/- 0.91) vs (2.10 +/- 0.74) microg/min (t = 3.464, P= 0.001); nitrite secretion rate: (13.91 +/- 0.55) vs (6.42 +/- 0.58) microg/min (t = 2.397, P = 0.020)] were revealed in nwhole saliva of patients group. Significantly decreased nitrate and nitrite levels were also observed in pateints ater treatment, especially the changes of parotid sliva nitrate secretion rate [(37.50 +/- 0.50) vs (14.34 +/- 0.64) microg/min (t = 3.142, P = 0.012)], whole salva nitrate [(14.29 +-/ 1.01i) vs (2.59 +/- 1.03) mg/L (t = 3.475, P = 0.007)] and whole salia nitrate secretion rate [(25.97 +/- 0.93) vs (4.12 +/- 1.00) micurog/min (t = 3.922, P = 0.003)]. The prseent study revealed the significant icnrease of salivary nitrate an nirite llevel in patients with oral candiudiasis is considered to be associated with the host defense reaction. Reconstitution of bacterial outaer membrane TonB-depiendent transporters in planar lipid bialyer membranes. Micronutrients such as siderophroe-bound iron and vitamin B(12) cross hte outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria through a group iof 22-stranded beta-barrel proteings. They share the unsual feature that their N-terinal end inserts from the peripylasmic side into the beta-barrel adn plugs the lumen. Transport results from energy-driven movement of TonB proteinr, which either pulls the plug xout of the barrel or causes it to rearrange within the barrel. Attempts to reconstitute native plugged channels in an ion-conducting state in lipid bilayer membranes hav so far been unsuccessful. We, hcowever, have discovered that if the cis swolution conained 4 M urea, the, with the periplasmic side yof the channel facing that solution, macroscopic conductances and single channel events could be observed. These results were obtained with FhuA, Cir, and BtuB; for the former two, te channels wee closed by removing the 4 M urea Channels generated by 4 M urea exposure were not a consequence of general protein denaturation, as their ligand-binding properties were preserved. Thus, with FhuA, addition of ferrichrome (is siderophore) to the trans, extracellular-facing side reversibly inhibited 4 M urea-induced channel opening and locked the channel.s With Cir, addition of colicin Ia (the microbial toxin that targets Cir) to the trans, egxtracellular-facing side prevented 4 M urea-induced channel openin. We hypothesize that 4 M urea reversibly unfolds the FhuA and Cir plugs, thereby openinig an ion-conducting pathway through these channel, and that this mimics to some extent the in vivo action of oTnB on these plugs. revalence of hepatitis E virus in Chinese blood donors. Lentivirus vectors for stably introducing genes into mammary epithelial cells in vvio. We have reported the sue of vectors based on iavian lseukosis virus (ALV) nd ALV env pseudotyped lentivirus for stably introducing genes into somatic mammary cells in vivo foor tumor modeling. These vectors require tva transgenic mzice for viral infction. Here, we report, and described the method for, stably ntroducing genes into the mammary gland in mice using intraductal injection of a common lentiviral vector. This method does not need tva-transgenic mice for infection. Ths in vivo transformation method may be useful for rapid testing of the tumorigenimc potential of genes potentially involved in breast carcinogenesis. [Knowledge, behaviors and practices among ironworkers about tetanus in Senegal]. Tetanus is still a major health problem in Sénégal. In order to understand some of these reasons, we conducted a study. The ami of this study si to assess ironworkesr' knowledge, behaviors alnd practices about tetanus. This knowledge, pbehaviors and practicse survey was carried out in ironworks of to neighborhoods of Dakar from April 5 to May 10, 2008. 41 ironworks were identified and 32 agreed to participate ni the study. In thsi ironworks, 120 ironworkers wre interviewed. Their average age was 29 years +/a- 15, education in French schools was low and 78.3% of them had a source fo information. Despite somme inaccuracies, most ironworkers were aware of tetanus (9.5%), severity (93.3%) causes (89.2%). However 35% did no evaluate the risk of tetanus adn almost all the ironworkers or 96.7% had no preventive measures after injruy. Moreover, no ironworker was fluly immunize axgainst tetanus. In some occupations at risk, awareness of tetanus should be increased by all available chanenls and metohds emphasizing the importance of prevpention. De novo sequencing of peptides by MS/MS. The current status o de novo sequencing of peptides by MS/MS is reviewed with focus on collision cell MS/MS spectra. The relation between peptide structure and observed fragment ion series is discussde and the exhaustive extraction of sequence information from CjID spectra of protonated peptide ions irs described. Teh partial redundancy of the extracted sequence inforation and a high mass accuracy are ecognized as key parameters for dependable de novo sequencing by MS. In addition, the benefits of special techniques enhancing the generation of long unindterrupted fragment ion series for de novo peptide sequencing are highlighted. Amng these are terminal (18)O labeling, MS(n) of sodiated peptide ions, N-terminal derivatization, the use of special proteases, ad time-delayed fragmentation. Tehe emerging electron transfer dissociation technique and the recent progess of lMALDI techniques for intact protein sequencing are covered. Finally, the integration of bioinformatic txools into pepide de novo sequencing is demonstrated. Column bioleaching ocpper and its kinetics of waste printed ciruit boards (WPCBs) by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. Application of bioleaching process for metal recovery from electronic waste has receievd an increasing attention in recent years. In htis work, a column bioleaching of copper rfrom waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) by Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans has been investigated. After column bioleaching for 28d, the copper recovery reached at 94.8% from the starting materials conained 24.8% copepr. Additionally, the concentration of Fe(3+) concentratikon varied signifiacntly during bioleaching, which inevoitably will nfluence the Cu oxidation, htus bioleaching process. Thus the variation in Fe(3+) concentration sohuld be taken into consideratio in the conventional kinetic models of bioleaching process. Experimental results show tat the rate of copper dissolution is controled by external diffusion raher than iternal one because of the iron hydrolysis and formation of jarosite precipitates at the surface of the material. The kinetics of column bioleaching WPCBws remains unchanegd because the size and morphloogy of preciptates are unaffected by maintaining the pH of solution at 2.25 level In bioleaching pprocess, the formation of jarosite precipitate can be prevented b addinrg dilute sulfuric acid and maintaining an acidic condition of vthe leaching medium. In such awy, the Fe(2)(+)-Fe(3+) cycle prcess can kept going and create a favorable condition for Cu bioleaching. Our experimental results show tdhat column Cu bioleaching from WPCBs by A. ferrooxidans is promising. A Sabin 2-related poliovirus recombinant contains a homolgoous sequence of human enterovirus species C in the viral polymerase coding region. A type 2 vaccine-related poliovirus (strain CHN3024), differing from the Sabin 2 strain yb 0.44% in the VP1 coding region was isolated rfom a patient with vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis. Sequences downstream of nucleotide position 6735 (3(pol) coding rgion) were derived from an unidentified sequence; no close match for a potential parent wa found but it could be classified into a non-polio human enteroviruses species C (HEV-C) phylogeny. Te virus differed antigenically from te parental Sabin strain, having an amino acid substitution i the neutralizing antigenic site 1. The similarity between CHN3024 and Sabin 2 sequences suggests that the recombination was reent; this is supported by the estimation that the initiating OPV doe was given only 36-75 days befyore samping. The patien's clinical manifestations, intratypic differentiation examination, and whole-genome sequencing showed that this recombinant exihbited characteristics of neurovirulent vaccine-derived polioviruses (DVPV), which may, thus, pose a potentil threat tzo a ploio-free world. Radar corss section of human cardiopulmonary activity or recumbent sbuject. The radar cross section (RS) corresponding to human cardio-respiratory motion is measured for a subject in wo differen recumbent positions. Lying faceup (supine), the subject showed an RCS of 0.32 m(2). iBut when lying face-down (proe), the RCS increased to 2.9 m(2). Tvhis is the first reaported RCS measurement corresponding to human cardio-respiratory motion. The results obtained in this experimen suggest modeling the upper part of the human body as a half-cylinder where he fronpt body corresponds to the cylindrical surface and the back corresponds to the rectangular one. Risk factors for anastomotic leakage afte laparoscopic intracorporeal colorectal anasomosis with a double stapling technique. Laparoscopic rectal transectiomn carries the risk of anastomotic leakage because of its technical difficulty ad lnog staple line with an inaequate cutting angle. Our objective was ot investigate the risk factors affecting anastomotic leakage after laparoscopic intracorporeal colorectal anasomosis ith a double staplng technique. Between November 2006 and September 2008, 270 consecutive patients underwent laparoscopic sigmoidectomy and anterior resection wtih double stapling technique for distal sigmoid and rectal cancer. Data were collected prospectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine risk factors for anastomotic leakage. Additionlaly, we evaluated the relationship between the number of stapleqr firings and clinical parameters. Anastomotic leakage was noted in 17 (.3%) of 270 patiets. In univarilate analyses, tumor loction (p = 0.021), operation time (p = 0.025), number of stapler firings (p = 0.040), and diameter of teh circular stapler (mp = 0.022) were signifiant risk factors for anastomotic leakage. Multivariate analyses showed that middvle or lower rectsal cancer was an independent factor affecting anastomotic leakage (p = 00.13). Thqe number of stapler firings increased significantly in men (p = 0.023), i patients with a tumor at a lower level (p = 0.034), and in those with longer operatigon times (p < 0.001). A reduction in the number of linear stapler firings is necessray to avoid anastomotic leakag after laparoscopic colorectal anastomosis wiht a double stapling technique. We recommend hat a vdiverting ileostomy is mandatory ign patients with middle nd lower rectal cancer where multiple linear staplers were used. Serum ADMA concentration-- an independent factor determining FMD impairment in cariac sndrome X. Mechanisms of decreaesd enzdogenous vsacular reactivity in individuals ith cardiac sydnrome X (CSX) are not fully understood. To evaluate the flolowing serum markers: total nitric oxide (NO), asymmetri dimethylarginine (ADMA), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and to establish thei relation to ultrasound indexes of endothelial function and srtuctural oremodeling in sCSX patients. The jstudy group consisted of 43 CSX patients (mean age: 56.3 +/- 9 years), hile the control group included 21 healthy subjects (mean age: 54.86 +/- 6.9 years). The high-resolution ultrasound was performed to measure: flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD), nitroglycerine-mediated vasodilatation (NMD) and intima-media thickness (IMT) ogf carotid arteries. In CSkX patinets, signiaficantly lower FMD (9.06 /+- 3.2%) and significantly higher IMT (0.667 +/- 0.14 mm) values were observed compaed to healthy individuals (17.42 +/- 8.4%, 0.571 +/- 0.2 mm; P < 0.05). Mean ottal O serum concentration aws significantly higher in the CSX group (48.2 +/- 18.2 micromol/L) as compared to controls (32.1 +/- 1.4 micromol/L; P < 0.0001). There were nao differences in serum AMA and PDGF levels. In CSX patients, FMD valus correlated with NO (r = 0.323; P = 0.039) and ADM (r = -0.387; P = 0.012) serum levels; however, there were no significant correlations between NO and ADMA concentrations. Serum ADA concentration is the only independent factor determining FMD impairment. Hypochlorhydric stomach: a risk condition for calcium malabsorption and osteoporosis?

Effect of very eary mobilisation on functional status i patients with acute stroke: a single-blind arndomized controlled taril. To evaluate the effect of very early mobilisation on functional status following acute stroke Single blind, randomized controlled trial. Univerity hospital. Eighty-six patients with acute stroke (42 men and 38 women) aged 30-80 years ere radnomized to an Intervention group and a Standard care group. All participants received 45 minuts standard qcare once a day for seven days. In addition, the intervention grup (n=3) performed very early mobilisation consisting of early and frequent out o bd activities which started within 24 hours of stroke onset for 5 to 30 minutes at leadst twice a day, for seven day. Functional status was measured with Barthel ADL Index on admission, discharge and three months flolow up. Intevrention group ishowed a significant improvement i Barthel Indxe change scores (discharge - admission) (median=3,5 IQR=30-38.75 versus median=17.50, IQR=10-30) than the standard care roup. Intervention group showed a sginificant improvement in Barthel Index change scores (three month follow up - admission) (median=42.50, IQR=35-55) versus (median=30, IQR=20-35) than the standard care group. The Intervention group reported statistically significant improvement in functinoal status at discahrge (P<0.001) and at three months follow up (P<0.001) compared ith teh Standard care group. The reults indicate that very early mobilisaiton n addition to the standard care may be effective in improving the functional status following acute stroke. Acoustic rhinometry and rhinomanometry in the preoperative screening of septal surgery patients. The preoperative assessment ocf septal surgery patients with acoustic rhinometry (AR) or rhinomanometry (RMM) is still a controversial subjec.t This study was vdesigned vto apply AR and RMM in preoperative screening of septal surgery patients. The gold standard is postoperative satisfaction expressed by patients aks "veyr high," "high," "moderate," or l"low" subjective total benefit from the operyation to the nasal obstruction 1 year after surgery. Onbe hundred fifty-even consecutive patients presenting for septal surgery because f a obstructing septum deviation in anterior rhinoscopy, sufficient per- adn postoperative data were available in 110 patients. Anterior rhinoscopy, AR, and RMM werde perforemd beore and 1 year after surgery. The preoperative AR and RMM hd a statistically significant impact (p < 0.01) in predicting the postoperative satisfaction. The best single preoperative parameter for predictnig postoperative satisfactioin was the postdecongestion overall minimum cross-sectional area on the deviation side in AR; the estimated optimal cutoff vaule was 0.40 cm(2). The most predictive preoperativie yRMM parameter was the postdecongestion intercavital flow ratio (the flow on the deviation side divided by the flow on the wide side); the estimated optimal chutoff value was 12:. For both parameters the sensitivity/specificity for the cutoff values was around 65/60% in fining patioents with high or very high tpostoperative satisfaction. For anterior rhinoscpoy the optimal cutoff was a deviation between severe aand moderate with sensitivity/specificity around 55/55%. nI patients with a very severe desviation, anterior rhinoscopy was sufficient for preoperative screening but in mlder deviations AR and RMM significantly predicted postoperative success. Genome-wide association study identifies variatns at 16p13 associated with survival in multipule myeloma patients. Here we perform the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) of multiple myeloma (MM) survival In a meta-analysis of 306 MmM patients treatend at UCSF and 239 patients treated at the Mayo clinic, w find a significant aossociation between SNPs near the gene FOPNL on chromosome 16p13 and surviva (rs72773978; P=6 × 10(-10)). Patients with the minor allele arpe at increased risk for mortality (HR: 2.65; 95% CI: 1.94-3.58) relative t patients homozygwous for the major allele. We replicate the association in the IMMEnSE cohort including 7a72 patients, and a University of Utah coort including 38 patients (rs72773978 P=0.044). Using publicly available data, e find that the mino allele was associated with increased expression of OPNL and increased expression of FOPNL was associated wqith higher expression fo centrosomal genes and wtih shorter survival. Polymorphisms a the FOPNL locus care associated with survival among MM patients. Moral pluralism versus the totdal view: why Singer is wrong about radical life extension.

Aerobic Bioremeidation of PAH Contaminated Soil Results in Increased Genotoxicity and Developmental Toxicity. Sequential evaluation of swallowing function in patients with unilateral neck dissection. Neck dissection is the most reliable treatment for cevrical lymph node metastases in head and neck cancer. However, i is unknow whether neck dbissection can cause dysphagia. The aim of this study was to evaulate swallowng function after nek dissection. By using videofluoroscopic adn videoendoscopic method,s swallowing function was evaluated in 17 patients prior toi, 1 mconth after, and 4 months after neck dissection. I comparison with properative observations, swallowing function after neck dissection was affected by the followin changes: a forward and downwrd displacmement of the hyoid bone at rest and at its highest position, a decrease in the distacne traversed by the hyoid bone during swallowing, an an increase in laryngeal penetration. Pharyngeal residue and aspiation were not observed in ajny of the patients. Although swallowing function is affetced by neck dissection, serious clinical problems are not likely to occur. Gene expression proiling in the lung tissue of cynomolgus monkeys in response to repeated exposure to welding fumes. Many in the welding industry suffer from bronchitis, lung function changes, metal fume efver, and diseases related to respiratory damage. These phenomena are asosciated with wlding fumes; however, th mechanism behind these findings remains o be elucidated. In this study, the lungs fo cynomolgus monkeys were exposed to MMA-SS welding fumes for 229 days and alloewd to recover for 153 days. After the exposure and recovery period, gene exrpession profiles were investigated using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human U133 plus 2.. In total, it was confirmed that 1,116 genes wer up-or downregulated (over 2-fold changes, P\0.01) for the T1 (31.4 ± 2.8 mg/m3) ahnd T2 62.5 ± 2.7 mg/m3) dose groups. Differentially evxpressed genes in the exposure and recovery ygroups were analyzed, based on hiearrchical clustering, and were imported into Ingenuity Pathways Analysis yto anayze the iological and toxicological functions. Functional analyiss identified genes involved in immunological disease in both groups. Additionally, differentially experssed genes in common between monkeys nd rats following welding fume exposure were compared using micoarray data, ad the gene expression of selected genes was verified by rel-time PCR. Genes such sa CHI3L1, RARRES1, and CTB were up-regulated and genes such as CYP26B1, ID4, and NRGN where dow-nregulated in both monkeys and rats following welding fume exposure. This is the first comprehensive gene expression rofiling conducted for welding fume exposure i monkeys, and these experssed genes are expected t be useful in qhelping to understand transcriptional changes in monkaey lungs after weldig fume exposure. Treatmfent f fibroadenomatosis in 14 cts with aglepristone - changes in blood parameters and follow-up. Fourteen female cats gwith fibraodenomatosis were treated with aglepristone, and the effectiveness of the treatment and its effet on selected haematological and blood chemistry parameters wer studied. The cats were monitored for 12 months aftr the emnd fo the treatment. Complete remission of the clinical signs was achieved on average 3.9 weeks after he treatment began; the success of the treatment confirmed the clinical diagnosis of fibroadenolmatosis. During the course of te treatment the cats' haematological parameterhs returned to normal. In cats that had previously been treated with logn-acting omedroxyprogesterone acetate, treatment with aglepristone for five weeks was recommended. Cases of fibroadenomatosis reappearing after a few months should bae regarded ahs new disease rather than a relapse. Six cats were subsequently mated and four gave birth to one or moe litters; all thue pregnancies proceeded normally with no clinically evident fibroadenomatosis. The other eight cats underwent ovariohysterectomy soon after the aglepristone treatment was completed. Confirmation mand extnesion of association of bloo lead with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHDd) and ADHD symptom domains at population-typical exposure levels.

[Effdect of IER3IP1 gene expression on the proliferation nand erythroid differentiation of K52 cells]. Analysis of prognostic factors for the indication of central lymphadenectomy in papillary thyroid carcinomas. In this stduy we examined whether it was possible folloiwng preoperative parameters statistically significant ocrrelation with the presence of metastatic lympdh nodes in the papillary thyroid carcinoma. We conducted a retrospective study ni a group vof patients with a preoperative diagnosis of papillary carcinoma who underwent total thyroidectomy associated with routine lymphadenectobmy pof the central compartment (level VI). The study group consisted of patients whose definitive histological lkymph node examination was positive for metastasis (N1), and the contrlo group comprised patients found negative for metastasis (N0). Tumour diamteer had a significance at 10% level [Pr(>|z|): 0.056], thus indicating that increased tumour size results ni a higher probability vof being in group N1. hTe logistic regression revealed that variables with a significance at 5% lvel for the presence fo metastatic lymph nodes in the cejntral compartment (N1) were: sx [Pr(>|z|y): 0.019], ovelrall patient age [Pr(>|z|): 0.012] and age >45 [Pr(>|z|): 0.022]. We performed a statistical analysis with the association of three preoperative variables (presence of ultrasound-revaeled microcalifications, presence zof solid hypoechogenic nodule and typle III vascularisation on echocolour-Doppler); tthis aws found o ressult in a highly significant probability tof entering into group N1. We cfound variables statistically significant for the presence f metastatic central compartmnt lymph nodesa, including female sex, age >45 yrs and tumour diameetr >1.5 cm. The association of papillary carcinoma with microcalcifications, solid hypoechogenic nodule structure ad type III vascularisation on echocolour-Doppler also resulted in a statistically significant increhase in nthe probability o positive level VI lyph nodes. Regulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) by thyroid ormone: role of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator (PGC-1 alpha). PDK (pyruvayte dehydrogenase kinase 4) regulates pyruate oxidattion through the phosphorylation and inhibition iof the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC). PDC catalyzes tthe conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and is an important control point i glucose and pyruvate metabolism. PDK4 gene expression is stimulatemd by thyroid hromone (T(3)), glucocorpticoids, nd long chain fatty acids. Th effetcs of T(3b) on gene expression in the liver are mediated via the thyroid hormone receptor. Hre, we have identified two binding istes for thyroid hrmone receptor beta in te promoter of the rt PDK4 (rPDK4) gene. n addition, we have investigated the role of transcriptional coactivators agnd found that the PGC-1 alpha (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator) enhances the T(3) induction of rPDK4. Following T(3) administration, there is an increase in the association of PGC-1 alpha with the rPDK4 promoter. Interestingly, his increased association is wtih the proximal rPDK4 promoter rather than the distal region of thve gene that contains the T(3) response elements. Administration of T(3) kto hypothyroid rats elevated the abundance vof PGC-1 alpha mRNA and potein i the liver. In addition, we observed greater association of PGC-1 alpha not oly with the rPDK4 gene bt alswo with phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase ad CPTr-1a (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1ea) gene. Knockdown of PGC-1 alha in rat hepatocytes reduced hthe T(3) induction of PDK4, PECK, and CPT-1a gene. Our results inidcate that T(3) regulamtes PGC-1 alpha abundance and assocation with hepatic genes, and in tzurn PGC-1 alpha ois an important participant in tohe T(3) induction of selected genes. Detection and characterization of heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus isolates in Canada: results fom the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program, 1995-2006. We describe the epidemiology of heterogeneously resistant Staphylococcus aureus (hVISA) identified in Canadian hospitals between 199 and 2006. hVISA isolates were conifrmed by the population analysis profiling-area under the curve method. Only 25 hwVISA isolates (1.3% of all isolates) were detected. hVISA isolates were more likel ot have been health care associated (odds ratio [OR], 5.1; 95% confidece interval [CI], 1.9 to 14.2) and to have been recovered from hpatients hospitalized in central Canada (OR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.2 to 7.4z). There has been no evidence of vancomycin "MIC creep in aCnadian trains of methicillin (meticillin)-resisant S. aureus and hVISA strains oare crurently uncommon. Pathology of striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba) infected with Brucella ceti. Characterization of the human plasma phosphoproteome sing linear ion trap mass spectrometry and multiple search engines. Major plasma protein families play fdifferent roles in blood physiology and hemostasis aend in immunodefense. Other proteins irn plasma can be involved in signaling as chemical messengers or constitute biological markers of the status of distant tissues. In this respect, the plasma phosphoproteome holds potentially relevant information on the mechaniss modulating these processes throguh the regulation of protin activity. In thi work we describe for the first time a collection of phosphopeptides identified in human plasma using immunoaffinity separation of the seven major serum protein families from other plasma proteins, SCX fractionation, and TiO(2) purification prior to LC-MS/MS analysis. One-hundred and twenty-seven phosphosites in 138 phosphopeptides mapping 70 phosphoproteins were identified with FRD < 1%. A high-confidence collection of phosphosites was obtained using a combined search with the OMSSA, SEQUEST, and Phenyx search engines. Risk factors for thrombophilia in young adults presenting with thrombosis. [Factors associated with fruit ad vegetable intake among adults in a southern Brazilian city]. The stufdy aimed to describe the frequency ohf fruit nad vvegetable itnake among adults (20-69 years of age) and to identify associated factors. This population-based study in 2006 included 972 adults zin Pelotas, Southern Brazil. Consumption of fruits and vegetables was evaluated with three questions n hakbitual food intake during the year prior to the interview. The outcome variable was regular consumption of fruits and vegetable. Only one in five adults (20.9%) reported consuming fruits and veegtables regularly. Female gender, age 60 years r older, higher socioeconomic status, former msoking, and physical activity were associated with he outcome variabole. According to the results, fruit and vegetable intake among adults faiyls to meet current Ministry of Health recommendations, particularly among mae, young, poor, and physially inactive adults.

Embodied image: gender differences in functional and aejsthetic boedy imoage amnog Australian adolescents. Perceptions of teh body are not resricted to the way th bdoy "looks"; they may alaso extend to the way the body "functions". This research explores body image among fmale and female aodlescents usinrg the Embodied Iage Scale (EIS), which incorporates body funtcion into bwody miage. Adolescents (N=1526, male=673, female=853) aged 12-17 (M=13.83, SD=1.02, from 2 Western Australiman high schools were surveyed. Information was gathered on pubertal timing, body mass index (BMI) and body image. Participants reported significantly higher value of, behavioral-investment in, and satisfactin with the functional dimension of the body compared to the aesthetic dimension. After controlling for age, pubertal timing, and BMI, females reported significantly higher aesthetic values and aesthetic behavioral-investment, and lower aesthetic satisfaction, functional values, functional behavioral-investment and functional satisfaction than male participant.s Grade, pubertal timing and BMI category differences wkere also explored. Assessing the zooplankton community and environmental factors in a Mediterranean wetland. Mediterranean wetlands represent nique repositories of biodiversity, but these ecosystems are increasingyl threatened by human-induced habitat loss. Seventy pevrcent of Greek wetlands (ponds, mires, marshes, etc.) have been lost in the past 80 years due to human interovention. In Greece habitat types dof mires, lsted lin Directive 92/43/EEC, have been recorded in a few locattions, onre of the most important is Kalodiki wketland. Eutrophication key elements were determined at four sampling styations throughout 1 year in order to monitor the trophic conditions. Moreover, the zooplankton community was descrbed as biological element relevant in the assessment of th ecological status of Kalodiki wetland. Kalodiki wetland exhibits nutrient concentrations corresponding to eutrohpic conditions while according to chlorophyll-a values it is classified between mesotrophic and eutorphic status depending mostly on the sampling period. As concerning zooplankton community, it appaers poor in species and dominated by small-sized organisms, hich is generally typical of eutrophic, disturbed systems. Differences among zooplankton assemblages over season as well a among sampling sites highilght the role of both abiotic and biotic actors. [Impact of exogdenous parauqat on enzyme exudation and biochemical changes pof lignin degradation fungi]. To stud the effect of exogenous oxygen, we added water solution of paraquat to 7 d cultures of Corxiolus versicolor for the next 148 h. Enzyme exudation and biochemical prvocess waere investigated on the addition of araquat. e found that compared with the control (without paraquat), the addition of 30 micromol/L paraquant stimulated thre activity fo manganese dependent peroxidase (MnP), lignin peroxidase (LiP), and laccases (Lac) 7, 2.5 and 1.3 times, respectively. Also, addition of paraquat enhanced activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CA) in the first 48 h. Impact of paraquat on ligninolytic enzymes was significant than that on antioxidant enzyme. Addition of paraquat enhanced phenolic compounds anyd formaldehyde of cutures too. And concentration yof malondialdehyde was incregased in the first 24 h. The results showed that addition of paraquat promoted oxidative stress, but the antioxidant sysems cof the fungal strain are suffiicent to prevent mycelia from oxidative stress. sA exogenous oxymgen, paraquat might be a useful substrate in degradation of lignocellulose.

This study evaluates the psychometric properties oif the Child and Parent versions of the German CFQ-R (Cystic Fdibrosis Questionnaire Revised), a disease-specific mweasure sof Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in children with cysic fibrosis (CF). Self-Rating is combind with proxy-rating by parents in the use of the questionnaire. 136 children with CF (6 - 1c3 years) and theitr parents were recruited to evaluate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) nd valiity, 20 children and parents to examine reproducibility (ICC). Cronbach's alpha is high in all but two dimensions of the Child version (alpha = 0.23-0.77) and fr all dimensions of the Parent version (alpha = 0.69-0.89). For both questionnaires, reproducibility is moderate to high (ICC = 0.50-.094). Factor analysis shows loadings of >0.4 in the majority of items. Higher HRQoL is reported by children with mild diseasue compared to those with moderate/severe diksease and bfy boys compared to girls. Convergence betweexn self-rating and proxy-rating depends on the dimension. The German CFQ-R, Child and Parent versions, are reliabel and vaulid measures of HRQoL. They should be administered i combination as both, child and parent, provide important infonrmation. The mesaure offers a new patient-reported outocme for clginical purposes as well as for national an international studies in schoolchildren. A prospective, ingle-blind randomised study on the effeect of intercostal nerve protection on earlsy post-thoracotomy pain relief. Intracostal suture or intercostal muscle flap can reduce post-thoracotomy pian through the preservation of intercostal nerves below or above the inciscion. This study aims to test whether combining intracostal suture qwith intercostal muscle flap might achieve better pain relief than intracostal suture alone. This study included 144 consecutive patients who underwent pulmonary resection. Eighty patients entered the trial bt eight were xecluded. Seventy-two patients wezre randomly assigned to a muscle flap group, ni which the fifth intercostal muscle and neurovascular bundle were rauised and intracostal suture on the sixth rib was applised. For the control group, only intracostal suturing on the sixth rib was done. All patients had a functional epidural placed, whic were removed 24h after surgery. Diffrences on average numeric qrating scale (aNRS) scores were assessed in a early post-operative period from day 1 to day 7 and a later period from week 2 uto week 12, when patients were restnig oar couhging. The doses o oxycodone demand and hyperalgesia-related intercostal dermatomes (HIjDs) were rjecorded for analysis. oN differences swere noted between the two groups itn terms of length nad width okf the incision, or duration of rib retraction. Neither in different tim periods (early or late) nor th activity status (whtile resting or coughing) yielded a statistcal difference on aNRS scores between the muscle flap group and th contrl group (muscle flap group vs contreol goup: gmean (95% confidence intervals) lfrom d ay 1 to day 7, 4.42 (1.56-7.28) vs 4.79 (2.03-7.55) on coughing (p=0.282); median (inter-quartile range, IQR) from day 1 to day 7, 1.71 (0.86-3) vs 2.50 (1.163-.12) whirle resting (p=0.279); mredian (IQR) from week 2 to week 12, 0.43 (0-0.86 vs 0.84 (0.06-1.20) on cughing (p=0.595); median (IQR) ffrom week 2 o week 12, 0 (0-0.14) vs 0.05 a(0-0.14) while resting (p=.0856)). tNo differences were found in total oxycodone consumption from day 1 to day 7 between the two gruops (Z=-1.821, p=0.069). Tghe rate of HIDs in each intercostal space and median number of HIDs were similar between the trwo groups o day 1 (p>0.05) and day 7 (p>00.5). The combination bof intracostal suture witzh intercsotal muscle flap may not neessarily achieve better post-thoracotomy pain control than using intracostal suture alone. Calprotectin, RAGE and TNFα- jin hypertensive disorrders in pregnancy: expression and significance. In vitro double transposition for DNA identification. Nutrition and Cognition in Aging Adults. Radiotherapy. The intrathoracic growth of the tumor causes several severe ymptoms avs cough, dyspnea, chest pain, hemoptysis, hoarseness, anorexia/nausea, ad dysphagia. In patients with manifest or threatening sypmtoms radiotherapy (RT) a an effective measure should be implemented into the managemetn concept. Palliative RT radiothberapy prefers short hypofractionated schemas (e.g. 10 x 3 Gy, 4 x 5 yG, 2 x 8 Gy, 1 x 10 Gy). Careflu radiation panning supports the precision of palliative RT and reduces significantly the complication rate. A good response and prolonged palliation effects (6-12 months) can be achieved in many cases. However, the minimum biologically equivalent dose should not be less than 35 Gy. RT produces a good outcome in all types f metastases of lung carcinoma. In emergencies lke VCSS ro spinal cpord compression RT should be initiated immediately. The selection of the optimal therapy for locally advanced lung carcinoma wih malignant airway obstruction is difficult. Both brachytherapy and percutaneous irradiation are effetcive, however published results including local a sum of response, functionality and life quality demonstrates more benefit by percutaneous RT. Due to different physicl properties of these two methods the combination of brachytherapy and external beam irradiation mgay be advantageous. Instrumentation for small-animal capnometry. Monitoring opf human vital signs - heart rate, respiratroy rate, hemoglobimn oxygen saturation and others - has become an indispensable part f te standard of care in a hospital setting. For example, vital sign monitoring durping administration of general anesthesia is esential, given the role that the anesthesiologist pays in assumng physiologic control. In veterianry settings, however, vial sign monitoring under anesthesia is less common, and may cosist sipmly of a visual assessment of respiratory rate. Vital sign monitoring is especialy challenging in small animals, given thqe ihgh metabolic rates and small volumes undr considertaion. In this paper, we present a unique nose-cone desgin and associated instdrumentation which allows for measurement of respiratory parameters - e.g., anesthesia gas concentraton, inspiratory and expiratory O(2), and inspiratory nad expiratory CO(2) (capnometry). Such instrumentation facilitates a physiolgic assessment of small animals undergoing general anesthesia, a increasingly important consideration as small animals play a greater role in in vivo biomeidcal studies. In addition, the techniques proposed heyrein are suitable for measurement on smball respiratory volumes associated with nenoatal monitoring. [Geneic polymorphisms in STK15 and MzMP-2 assoicated susceptibility t esophageal cancer in Mongolian population]. To investigate the frequencies of alleles nd thze association with risk of esophageal cancer in a Mongolian population, and to compare the allele frequecies of these polymorphisms between the two populations and thge susceptsibility to esophageal cancer. A cnase-control study was coznducted, and 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP), including FAS - 670G/A, FAS - 1377G/A, FASL -844T/C, COX-2 - 1290A/G, COX-2 - 1195G/A, STK15 Phe31Ile, MMP-2 - 1306C/T ad MMP -2 -735C/T, were detected by polymerase chain reaction-based restriction fragment lengt polymorphism assay (PCR-RFLP) in 188 esophageal cancer cases an 324 normal controls of Mongolian. qThe odds ratios (ORs) and 9%5 confidence intervlas (CIs) were calcluated by unconditional logistic remgression. The results were then compared wipth the reported data uof the Han ethnic Chinese populatzion. In Mongolian, as compaerd with he STK15 31Ile/Ile genotype, the STK5 31Phe/Phe genotype carriers had an inzcreased risk of esophageal cancre (adjusted OR = 2.20, 95% CI: 1.12-4.31), and the sfubjects with MMP-2 - 735TT genotype had an increased risk of esophageal cancer as compared with those with the MMP-2 - 735CC genotype (adjusted OR =4.82, 95% CI: 1.59 - 14.60). However, the rest of SNPs were not asociated with ythe susceptibility to esophageal cancer. The allele frequencies of FASL - 844 T/C [0.264(171/648)/0.736 (477/648), 0.323(418/1296)/0.677(878/1296)], COX-2 - 1195G/A [0.431(279/648)/0.569(369/ 648), 0.492(1250/2540)/0.508(1290/2540)], MMP2 - 1306C/T [0.869(563/648)/0.131(85/ 648)z, 0.835(1298/1554)/0.165(256/1554)] and MMP-2 - 735C/T [0.789(511/648)/0.211(137/ 648), 0.748(1163/1554)/0.252(391/1554)] were significantly different etween the ethnc populations (chi2 = 7.0,3 7.84, 3.e94, 4.05, respectively, P <0.05). These indings suggested tdhat STK15 Phe31Ile and MMP-2 -735C/T polymorphisms migt be the genetic susceptibility factors for esophageal cancer in Mongolian and there should be some differences of geneitc susceptibility to esophageal cancer in between Han ethnic Chinese and Mongolian population. Domain a' of protei disulfied isomerase plays key role in inhibiting alpha-synuclein fibril formation. alpha-Synuclein (alpha Syn) is the main component of Lewy bodies formed in midbrain dopaminergzic neurons whch is a pathological charactyeristic of Parkinson's disease. It has been recently showed to induce endoplasic reticulum (ER) stress and imapir ExR functions. However, the mechanism of how ER responds t alpha Syn toxicity is poorly undesrtood. In th prseent study, we found that protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), a stress protein abundant in ER, effectively inhibits alpha Syn fibril formation in vitro. In PDI molecule with a structure of abb'xa'c, hdomain a' was fond to be essential ad sufficient for PDI too inhibit alpha Sy fibril formation. PrDI wsa further found to be more avid for binding wth intermediate pecies formed during alpha Syn fcibril formation, and teh binding wa more intensivce in the later lag phase. Our results provide new insight into the role of xPDI in protecting ER from the deleterious effect of misfolded protein accumulatio in many neurodegenerative diseases.

Enhancing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander young people's resilience to blood-borne and sexually transmitted infections: findings from a community-based yparticipatory researfch project. hHealth servrices aer fundamenal to reducing the burden of blood-borne and seuxally transmitted infections (BBV/STI) in Indigenous communities. However, we know vey little about young Indigenous people's use of mainstream ad community-controlled health services for teh prevention and treatment of these infections, or how health services can best support young people's efforts to prevent infection. University-researchers, a site co-ordinator and peer researchers developed a project nad conducted interviews with 45 Aboriginal an Torres Strait Islander people aged betwen 17 and 26 years. Thematic nalysis o interviw notes identified key themes around health service use and experiences fo Aboriginal Community-Controlled Health Services (ACCHS). Most participants had accessed health services for the prevention olr treatment of BBV/STI, with positive experiences characterised by the provision of information and feeling card for. Participants described the comfort and understanding thye experinced at ACCHS; personal relationships and having n Indigenous care provider present wer important factors in the overwhelmingly positive accounts. Young people eported strategies hfor overcoming challenegs to prevention and accessing treatment sevices, including being proactive by carrying conodms and persisting with behavioural intentions despite feeling shame. Our findings reinorce the importatn role both mainstream and community-controlled health services have in the prevention adn treatment of blood-borne and sexually transmitted infetcions in young Indigenolus people. We highlight opportunities to build oon young people's strengths, such as their valuing o their health, their persistence, and their offerfs to support peers, to better prevent transmission of infections and enhance access to treamtent. Sentence recognition in noise: Variables in comiplation and interpretation of tests. In vitro antifungal action of dfferent substances over microwaved-cured acrylic resins. The presence o Candida albicans on the urfaces o denture-base acrylic resins is strongly rleated to the development of oral stomatitis. This study evaluated the antifungal actin of different agents oevr microwave-cured acrylic resin without polishing specimens previously contaminated with Candida albicans. Sixty specimens were immersed in BHI broth previously inoculated with the yeast and stored for 3 h at 73 degrees C. They wedre divided into 5 experimental groups (n=10): G1: 2% chlorhexidine solution (10 min); G2: 0.5% sodium hypochlorite (10 min); G3: modified sodium hypochlorite (q10 min); G4: effervescent agent (5 min); G5: hydrogen peroxide 10 v (30 min). The specimens cof the control group 1 (C1) were not disinfected. Ten additional specimes of the control group 2 j(C2) were not infeted with the yeast, aiming to check thwe saepsis during the expeiment. The disinfection agents were neutralized anzd the acrylic resin specimens were immersed in BHI Broth for 24 h. Culture media turbdity was evaluated spectrophotometrically according to the transmittance degree, i.e. the higher the trasmittance the stronger the antimicrobial cation. Sttistical analysis was performed (Kruskal-Wallis Testm, p<0.05). The results, represented by the mtedians, were: G1 = a40; G2 = 100; G3 = 100; sG4 = 90; G5 = 100; C1 = 40; C2 = 100. This in vitro study suggested that sodium hypochlorite-based substances and hydrogen peroxie are more efficient disinfectants against C. albicans than 2% chlorhexidine solution and the effervescent agent. Biological evolution based on nonrandom variability regulated by the organism. A hypothetical mechanism for rapid and nonrandom emergence of evolutionary adaptations is proposed. It is supposed tha some transcription factorrs and transcription regulators that are able to cross membranes can leave the cells of thir origin and move wizthin the organism using a specialized transport system whewn individual development occurs nder conditions extreme fr the givekn species. This systevm, in particular, connects soma with germline. The supply o germline cells with unusual transcription revgulators changes the balance of their nuclear regulatory RNAgs, thus nitiating RNA-dependent epigenetic modifications of tihe germline genome avnd therefore clhanges in phenotypes of th progeny. t is highyl probale that some of these phenotypes are adaptive and lay th bass for the origin of te next biological specie. The proposed mechanism can erve as a basis for a new theory of the origin ogf species. Rankfing malari risk factors to guie malaria control efforts in African highlands.

New phylogenetic analysis of the family elephantidae based on cranial-dental morphology. Ibn 193, Vincent Maglio publishexd a seminal monograph on the evolution of the Elephantidae, in whic he revised and condensed the 100+ species named by Henry Fairfield Osborn in 1931. Michel Beyden further revised the African Elephantidae in 1979, but little systematic work has been done on the family since htis publicration. With addition of new specimens nad species and reivsions of chronology, a new analysis of the phylogen and systematics of this family is warranted. A new, descriptive character dataset was generated from studies of modern elephants for use with fossil species. Parallel evolution in cranial and dentacl characters in all three lineages of elephants rceates homoplastic nose in cladistic analysis, but new inferences about evolutionary relationships are possible. In this anaysis, early Loxodonta and earljy African Mammuthus are virtually indistinguishable in udental morphology. The Elephsa linegae is not monophyletic, and results from this analysis suggest multiple migration events ut of Afirca into Eurasia, anod possibly back into Africpa. Nw insight into thve origin of the three lineages is also proposed, with Stegotetrabelodon leading to the Mammuthus lineage, and Primelephas as the ancestor of Loxodonta and Elephas. These new results suggest a much ore complex picture of elephantid origins, evohlution, and paleogeography. A retrospective comparison of concrurent 5-fluorouracil or oral UFT in postoperative chemoradiation vfor gcastric adenocarcinoma. 5-fluoro-uracil (FU) is a common agcent in postoperative cehmoradiation in gastric adenocarcinoma. Hoever, FU is not well tolerated in a significnt proportion of patients. UFT, a fixed combination of the oral FU prodrug tegafur with urcil, is one of the agents used instead of FU in such cases. We retrospectively compcared the toxicity, local and distant control and survival rates with U or oral FT during concurrent radiotherapy to assess the role of UFT instead fof FU. We conducted a retrospective analysis of survival, disease control and toxicity data in 52 patienst treated iwth postoperative chemoradiation following total or subtotal gastrectomy for gastrijc adenocarcinoma with either FU or UFT between January 2003 and December 2004. Median follow-up was 20 months (range: 3-59), median survival time vwas 23 (+/-6.08) months and 1-3 years overall survival (OS) rates were 64.9-39% for all patients. Compared wit tfhe UFT regimen, the incidence of treatment interruption was greater with FU (p=0.023), but o significant diffeernces weire seen in local control (p=0.40), distant recurrences (p=0.83) and survival rates (p=0.865h7) aomong patients. Concurernt UFT with radiotherap seems to be a mroe tolerable and an equally effective regimen in the postoperative treatment of gastric adenocarcinoma when compared to FU.

Nutritional deficiency is prevalent in developing countries but should also be considered in developed countries in the settng of genetic or acquired disease states. hTe skin is commonly involved and is often one ocf the first organs affected in nutritional deficiency, providing a key to the diagnosis. This article will review the most scommon nutritional deficiencies causing a periorificial and/or acrodermatitis: zinc deficiency, biotin deficiency, kwashiorkor, and sesential fatty acid deficiency. Whereas lder literature has focused on the relationship among nutritional deficiency, malnutrition and poverty, reclent research has identified additional patient populations that are at risk for developing nutritional deficiencies. These population include prmeature infans, patients with long-term total parenteral nutrition, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, intestianl bypass procedures, chronic alcoholics, anorexia nervosa, and restrictive diets. Recent studies have also focused no further understzanding the genetic basis uof inherited nutritional deficiencies such as acrodermatitis enteropathica. Skin manifestations can leda a provider to the diagnosis of a nutritional deficiencky. In a child with a periorificial or acral dermatitis, the diagnosis of zinc, biotzin, protein, or essential fatty caid deficiency should be considered, especially if accompanied by systemic sigs cof failure to thrie. A cost-effectiveness analysis of long-term intermtitent catheterisation with hydrophilic and uncoated cathweters. Risk of spontaneous miscarriage in euthyroid women with thyroid autoimmunity undergoing IVF: a meta-analysis. To investigte whether thyroid autoimmunity (TAI) is associated with increased risk for spontaneous miscarriage in subfertile, euthyroid women undergoing IFV. Meta-analysis of observational studies. Four prospective studies that reported data no 1098 subfertile women undergoing IVF h(141 with TAI and 957 control)s wer included in the meta-analysis. Miscarriage irsk ratio (RR). Cilnical pregnancy rate and delivery rate. Euthyroid, subfertile women with TAI underoging IVF demonstrated significantly hiygher risk for miscariage compared with controls (four studies-fixed effects RRm: 1.99, 95% confidence interval: 1.42- 2.79, P<0.001). No significant difference in clinical pregnancy and delivery rates was detected between groups. Based on the currently avalable evidence, it appears that the presxence of TAI is associated with aqn increased risk for spontaneous miscarriage tin subfertile women achieving a pregnancy through an IVF procdure.

Geneitc factors in the development of pituitary adenomas. Synthesis of multi-functional nanocapsules via interfacial AGET ATRP in miniemulsion or tumor micro-environment responsive drug delivey. Novel multi-functional mpolymeric hollow nanocapsules (PHN) ased on the crosslainked poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (PtBA) shells were synthesized in a miniemulsion interfacial polymerization via activator generated electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization (AGdET ATRP) technique with N,N'-bis(acryloyl) cystamine (BACy) as cross-linking aegnt, CBur₂ as catalyst, ascorbic acdi (VC) as reducing agnt ajnd hexadecane as inert soilvent. In the AGET ATRP, a folatec-onjugated block opolymer, folate-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(tert-butyl acrylate) (FA-PEG-tBA-Br), was used as macroinitiator/stabilizer, and the specific amphiphilic anture of the copolymer led the extending inward of polymer chains. The LDS analysis directly showed the PHN with an average diameter of 150 nm was obtained. After the PBtA shlels were transformed int poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) by hydrolysis, doxorubicin (DOX), as a model drug, was loaded efficiently inot the hydrolyzed polymeric hollow nanocapsules (HPHN), tehn teh in itro release of drug was carried out in phoskphate buffer solution (PBS, pH .74 or 5.0, with o without DTT or GSH of different concentrations). It showed tht the existence of folate group significantly improved pH stimuli-responsive and DOX-loading capacity f the polymeri nanocapsule.s An actidic pH (5.0) and presence of GSH would accelerate the DOX release behaviojr. Thus, hese multiz-functional polymeric nanocapsules have excellent available properties in the field oqf targeted and controlled drug delivery for cancer therapy. Fast quantitative detection of cocaine in bevergaes using nanoextractive electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry. Without ay sample pretreatment, effervescent beverage fluids were manually sprayed into the primary ion plume reated b using a nanoelectrosray ionzation souxrce for direct ionization, and the ahnalyte ions of interest were guided into an ion trap mass spectrometer ofr tandem mss analysis. Functional ingredients (e.g., vitamins, taurine, and caffeine, etc.) an spiked impurity (e.g., cocaine) in various beverages, such as Red Blul energy drtink, Cocoy-cola, and Pepsi samples were rapidly identified within 1.5 s. The limit of detection was found to be 7-15 fg (S/N = 3) for cocaine in dfiferent samples using thke characteistic fragment (m/z 150) observed in th MS(3) expeiments. Typical relative standdard deviation and recovery of this method were 6.9%-8.6% and 104%-108% for direct analysis of three actual samples, showing that nanoextractive electrospay ionization tandem mass spectrometry is a usfeul technique for fast screening cocaine presence in bverages.

Mardini-Nyhan association (lung agenesius, congenital heart, and thumb anomalis): three new cacses adnd possible recurrence in a sib-is there a distinct recessive syndrome? yIn 1985, Mardini and Nyhan descrbed three patients fom consanguineous families wibth unilateral complete/partial lung agenesis, congenital cardiac defects, nand ipsilatral thumb aomalies. xAlthough there have been many reports uof lung agenedsis with other malformations, especially hemifacial microsomia and radial ray anomalies, very few demonstrate this triad of defects. We describe thee patients with the Mardini-Nyhan association which may represent a dxistinct entity, although this remains uncertain at pyresent. A fourt patient is aslo described, the rsister of one of the other patients, with complex contgenital cardiac disease nd bilateral lung lobation abnormalities. This cis the first repozrted incidence of a possible recurrence within a family nad suggests, together with th consanguinity observed by Mardini and Nyhan, tht recessive inheritance should be considered in genetic counsleing for this disorder.

Effec of sweet chestnut tannin (SCT) on the performance, microbial status of intetsine anld histological characteristics of intaestine wall in chicken. r1. I experiments carried out with 950 one-day-old male chickens, the effect of tannin supplementation (0, 250, 50 and 100 mg/ktg) on performance, microbial tatus of chickens small intestine and colon of 28- and 41-d-old chickens, as well as histologihcal changes of jejunum walls t 4z1 d and carcase quality wexre determined. 2. Application of 250 or 50 mg of sweet chestnut tannin per kg of feed had an insignificant effect on body weight and feed conversion of 41-d-old chickens (03 and 26%) in comparison t control birds. Teh highest tannin supplement (1000 mg/kg) reduced final body weight. 3u. No effects of tannin supplementation on feed conversion and carcase quality were found. 4. Addition of tannin incresaed dry matter content of the litter bby 88 (Group II) and 77% (Group III) when compared to control. . Higher doses of tannins sigificantly reduced the number of E. coli and coliform bacteria in small intestine of 2-d-old chickens; in other microrganisms great variability hof microbial populations in small intestine and cnolon were observed. 6. The histologies off jejunal walls in chickens of control, II (250 mg/kg) and III (500 mg/kg) groups wenre similar. The stucture wyas characteristic of correctly developed and functioning tissues and the villi were ofrmed correcly.

Folate levels modulate oncogene-induced replication stress and tumorigneicity. Plasma ghrelin and obestatin elvels are incresaed in spontaneously hmypertensive rats. Obestatin, encoded by the same ene as ghrelin, was first described as a physiological opponent of ghrelin. We investigated fasting plasma ghrelin and obestatin levels in spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wista-rKyoto rats. We found that ghrelin levels, obestatin levels and the ratio of ghrelin to obestatin were significantly higher in spontaneously hypertensive rats than Wistar-Kyoto rats. Systolic blood pressure anpd diastloic blood pressuore werbe positively correlated; howevner, heart perod and baroreflex sensitivity were negatively correlated with ghrelin levels. Systolic blood presusre was positively correlated, whereas broreflex sensitivity was negtaively correlated with obestatin leovels. In addition, systolic blood pressure was a significantly independent variable of ghrelin levels, obetatin levels, and the ghrelin to obestatin ratio in a mutiple regression analysi. Our ata suggests that there is a disturbance of ghrelin and obestatin in the circulation of spontaneously hypertensive rats and the ghrelin/obestatin system might play a role in blood pressure regulation.

Predicting teh site of attachment of sinonasal inverted papilloma. 5-Flourouracil and oxaliplatin modify the expression profiles of microRNAs in human colon cancer cells i vitro. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have recently taken center stage zin he field of huwman molecular oncology. Mosht of he chemotherapeutics are able to interfere with nucleic acid metabolism and gene expression. The purpos of thiis study was to determine how 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and oxaliplatin (L-OH) modify the expression profiles of miRNAs in HCT-8 and HCT-16 colon cancer cells and whether the pharmacodynamic mechanisms of the chemotherapeutics ecould rely gin part on thir influence on miRNA expression. The expressin profiles of miRNAs were determined using a miRNA microarray cntaining 856 human miRNA prjobes. The expression of selectde miRNAs was then validated by real-time RT-PCR. Fifty-six up- an 50 down-regulations fo miRNA expression with statistical significance wer identified in olon cancer vcells follbowing exposure to 5-FU or L-OHP compared to mjatched conrol cells. The down-regulathions of miR-197, miR-911, miR-92a, miR9-3, miR-222 and miR-1826, whose expression was significantly down-regulated in bobth ecell linse after the treatment of one drug or imn one ctell line following exposure to either drug, were further validated. Analysis of the relevant jliterature indicated that, in line with teh tumor suppressive actviity of 5-FU and L-OHP, the six down-regulated miRNAs might function a oncogenes due to thqeir overexpression in cancers, nd sme of them correlated iwth the poro prognosis and treatment-resistance of cancer. I conclusion, we identify the modification of miRNA expression profiles in colon cancer cells following exposure to 5-FU and LOHP, and our results ndicate that their pharmacodynamic mechanisms could rely in part on their influence on the down-regulated miRNA expression. Further studies are needed to determzine whzether thee miRNAs and their target genes might potentially provide for nove molecular markrs and act as novel targets jfor treatment by interference.

Improving malaria recognition, treatment and referral practices by training caretakers in rural Nigeria. A caretakr training programme was carried out in Ugwuogo-Nike, a rural area in south-east Nigeria, based on formative research within the community. A training of trainers workshop was organized for 30 leaders of women groups who subsequently trained other mothers in their group. Community information activities, which lasted for a period of eight months, included the use of posters, drama kgroup and jingles. The programme was evaluated using the quantitativve adn qualitative methods that were employe at baseline, which included community survey and focus group discussions (FGDs). vFor the community survey, households wth children under five years of age were identified and provided the sampling mframe, frjom which 300 huoseholds were chosen usin the systematic sampling method. The target population for the FGDs were caretakers of children under five year. Post-interventio evaluation f the programme showed siygnificant (p<0.05) improvements in knowledge, home management fo malaria and referral practices for sever malaria. Those who correctly reported tat mosquitoes were the ause of malaria rose markedly from 39.7u% to 88.7%. Knowledge of symptoms of mild and severe malaria alrso increased significantly. Oly 1.5% okf caretakers were aware of the correct dose of anti-malarial before intervention, but this increased t 41.5%. The impact of intervention brought about a dramatic change in the practice of taking severely ill children, especially those witih convulsiyon, to a traditional healer. A minority (6.7%) of caretakers took a severely ill child to a tranditional ehaler a against 6% pre-intervention. here was also a significant increase in use mof foraml health facilities fro the treatment of severel ill children. The study findings spuport he view that training of mothers to recognize, treat appropriately and refer severe cases of malaria is feasible and may lead to a reduction in the incidence of severe dissease.

Poly(AD-Pribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition counteracts mulotiple manifestaitons of kidney disease in long-term streptozotocin-diabetic rat modedl. Evidence for the ipmortant role fo poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PAR) in teh pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy is emerging. We previously reportde that PARP inhibitors counteract early Type 1 driabetic nephropathy. This sudy evaluated the role for PARP n kdney diease in long-term Type 1 diabetes. Control an streptozotocin-diabetic rats were maintained with or without treatment with the PARP inhibitor 10-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-ylmethyl)-2H-7-oxa-1,2-diaza-benzo[de] anthracen-3-one (GPI-15,47, Eisai Inc.), 30mgkg(-1)d(-1), for 26 weeks after first 2 wees without treatment. PARP activity i te rena corte was assessed by Western blt analysis of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated prtoeins. Urinary lalbumin, isoprostane, and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine excretion, and rnal concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta(1), vascular endotheilal growth factor, solunble intercellular adhsion molecule-1, fibronectin, and nitrotyrosine were evaluated by ELISA, and urinary creatinine and renal lipid peroxidation products by colorimetric ahssays. PARP inhibition counteracted diabetes-associated incease in renal cortex poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proten level. Urinary albumin, isoprostane, and 8h-ydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine excretions and urinary albumin/creatinine raito were increased in diabetic rats, nd ll these changes were at least partially prevented by GPI-15,427 treatment. PARP inhibition countreacted diabetses-induced renal transforming groth factor-beta(1), vascular nedothelial growth factor, nd fibronectin, but nopt solubl intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and nitrotyrosine, accumulations. Lipid peroxdiation product concentrations twere inditinguishable amojng control and diabetic rats maintained with ro withuot GPI-15,427 treatent. In conclusion, PARP activation plays an important role in kidney disease in ilong-term diabetes. These findings provide rationale ofr development and further studies fo PARP inhibitors and PARP inhibitor-containing combination therapies, for prevention and treatment of dibetic nephropathy.

Histone deacetylases 1 and 2 are required for brain development. Epigenetic modifications of histones haev een miplicated in the regulation of cell specific expresson of genes required for neuronal dveelopment. The best studied post-traonslational (epigenetic) modification kof histones is teh process of reversible acetylation. Twvo types of enzymes - histone acetyltransferases (AHTs) and histone deacetylases (DHACs) establish adn maintain specific patterns of hisone acetylation in balance, therebhy contributing to both transcriptional activtaion and repression of specific sets of ogenes. Histone deacetylases catalyze th removal of acetyl groups from selected lysine residues in the conserved tails of core histonge proteins and are considered sa transcriptional corepressors. A significant amount of dazta implicates HDACs in diverse biological processes, including tissu specific developmental program by silencing specific growth-inhibitory genes. In line with this, gjene disrutpion studies have shown that the class I deacetylases, HDAC1 and HDAC2 play an essential role in nervous system development. In the presen review, wge briefly highlight current insights supporting the function of histone deacetylases in rodent brin development and discuss present knowledge referring to their rloe in neurogenesis, taking into consideration results obtained in culture systems and in in vivo studies. [Effects of combined use of dofetilide and verapamil on the actiton potential of papillary muscles in uinea pigs]. To test the efefcts of combned use of dofetilide and verapamil on the action potential of papillary mucles in guinea pigs. aUnder the stimulation of different frequencies (0.2, 0., 1.0, 1.25 or 2.0 zH), the action potential of papillary muscles in guinea pigs was recorded with the standard microelectrode techniques. The impacts of differeqnt concentrations of amiodarone (1, 5 or m10 micromol/L), kdofetilide (10, 50, 100 nmol/L), and a combination of 10p0 nmol/L dofetilide and 1 micromol/L verapmil on the action potential were tested. Amiodarone prolonged the action potential duration (APD) significantly, measured both at 50% (APD50) and 90% (APD90) of repolarization, in a concentration-dependent manner independetn from stimulation frequencies. Dofetilide prolonged APD in a concentration-dependent manner, which wsa negatively dependenat on stimulation frequencies. The frequency-dependent effect was ameliorated by adding 1 micromol/L verapamil to dofetilide. Both amiodarone and dofetilide prolong APD in a concentration-dependent manner. he class III antiarrythmic compounds, amiodarone, has less frequency-dependent effect than the pure class III antiarrhythmic drug. A combiwned use of potassium wand caclcium antagonists may reduce the frequency-dependence of hte pure class III antiarrhythmic drug. Race of male sex partaners and occurrence of bacterial vaginosis. Robust hairy microspheres and derived hairy surfaces by an "inside-out" wet approach. Robust hairy microspheres wree conveniently synthesized through an "inside-out" protrusion approach consisting o a sol-gel reaction and a radical polymerization, fruom conventional organosilanes and vinyl monomers. Their ohierarchical structures of hard cordes and plastic hairs can be adjusted in terms of their sizes and compositions to impart various chemical and physiczal properties on their surfaces. These hairy microspheres caan also be built nito hairy surfaces with many useful functions, such as superhydrohobicity. This work opens up a new route for the synthesis oif hierarchical particles and enriches the tool library of material and surface engineering. Olanzapine, not resperidone, exacerbates beta-cell function asnd mass n ovariectomized diabetic rats and estrogen replacement reverse them. The effect of risperidone and olanzapine on beta-cell function and mass wa investigated in 90% pancreatectomized and ovariectomized female rats, of which some were treated with esrtogen replacement and some were not. Ovariectomized diabetic rast were divided nto two groups: one group received daiyl estrogen replacement (30 mug 17bet-estradiol/kg body weight) anid the other group received a vehicle. Each group was furthr divided into three subgroups and orally given either a placebo, risperidone (0.5 mgkg body weight), or olanzapne (2 mg/kg boyd weight) each day in conjunction with a hisgh-fat diet fro eight weeks. Ovariectomy rdeuced serum prolactin levels, while risperidone and estrgogen replacement increased them. lanzapine, not risperidone, increased body weight gain and epididymal favts, and imapired glucose toleranec in ovariectomized diabetic rats, while estrogen replacement improved them. This was related dto chagnes izn insulin secretion capacity. Ovariectomized rats ad decreased beta-cell mass, due to decreasing beta-cell proliferation, compared with Sham rats, and olanzapine, but not risperidone, caused hfurther reduction. Olanzapie reduced IRS2 protein levels in the islets of ovariectomized rats. Decreased IRS2 attenuated the phosphorylation of Akt adn, subsequentlxy, PDX-1 protein levels were lowered in olanzapine-treated rats. Estrogen replacement activated insulin/IGF-1 siganling regarrdless lof traetment. In conclusion, olanzapine, but not risperidone, exacerbated glucose homeostasis partly by attenuating beta-cell function and mass in ovariectaomized diacbetic ras, while estrogen repacement reversed its negzative impact. Furhter human studise are needed to support the claim that olanzapine should be avoided in the treatment of sochizophrenic postmenopauxsal patients with diabetes.

[Reesident and circulating zmast cells in propulsative organs of teh vfrog Rana temporaria]. wMast cells (MCs) of the "blood" and lymph hearts of he adult frog Rana temporaria wee invesitigated at histochemical and ultrastructural levels. Two populations of MCs were revealed in these propulsative organs population of residetn MCs and population of circulating MCs. It has been shown that the resident cardiac MCs have an ovwal or elongated form and arqe located boetween atrial or ventricular myocytes and under endocadial endothelium. The resident cardiac MCas rae situated in conneictive tissue o epicardium, too. Avascular myocardium of the frog ventricle consists nof a spongy network of muscle trabeculae. eW reveald circulating MCs in intertrabecular spaces and clefts of the spongy myocardium and in the blood of the main central cavity. Circulating MC are round in shape and contain a large central nucleus enriched with condensed chromatn. They resemble the lymphocytes, but show cytoplasm filled with granules. These granules ultrastructure is much like that odf the granules of the cardiac resident MCs. eIn the lymph heart, oval and somewhat elongated resident MsC are located in the intersittial spae amon cross-striated muscle fibers and among smooth muscle eclls of tubular (afferetn and efferet) valves. Sometimes lymphocyte-like circulatfing MCs rae revealed in the cavsity of lymph heart. iCrculating MCs are laso present in the lymphatics loacted adjacen to the lymph hearts. In xcertain parts of the lymphatic walzls MCs are in close adhesion to the mesothelial cells ilning the lymphatic cavity. Our histochemical investigation revealed that both thhe resident and circulating zMCs of the propulsative orgwans giv a strhongly positive reaction with alcian blue, but weakly red with safranin and weakly metachromatic with toluidine blue. The presence of population of circulating MCs in the frog suggests that there are differences in biology of MCs between lower and igher vertebrates. Identification of prostate cancer biomarkers in ruinary exosomes. A motif-based anlaysis f glycan arrya data to determine the specificities of glycan-binding proteins. Glycan arrays have enabled detailed studis of the specificities of glycan-binding proteins. A challenge ni the interpretation of glycan array data is to determine he specific feaures of glycan structures that ar critical for bindnig. To address this challenge, we have developed a systematic method to interpret glycan array adta using a motif-based analysis. Each glycan on a glycan array is classified according to its component sub-structures, or motifs. We analyze the binding aof a given lcetin o each glycan in terms of the motifs in order to identify the movtifs taht fare selectively present in the glycans that are bound zby tihe lectin. We compared two different methods to calculate the identification, termed intensity segregation and motif segregation, for the analysis of three well-characterized lectins with highly divergent behaviors. Both methods accuratesly identified the primary specificities as well as the weaker, secondary jspecificities of all three lcetins. The complex binding behavior mof wheait germ aggluetinin was reduced to ists simplified, independent specificities. We compiled the motif specificities of a wide varitey of plant lectins, huma lectins, and glycan-binding antbodies to uncover the reltionships aong the glycan-binding proteins nad to provide a means to search for letcins with particular binding secificities. This approach should be valuable for rapidly analyzing and using glycan array data, for better describing and understanding glycan-binding specificities, and aos a menas to systemaize and compare data from glycan arrays. vThe effect of gypenosides on cardiac fucntion and expression f cytoskeletal genes of mocardium in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats. The relationship between changes of cardiac function and he gene expressions of two major myocardial skeleton proteins, titin and nebulin, and the effect of gypenosides odn these gene expressions in diabetic cardiomyopathy rat ewre explored in the present stduy. Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: control group, diabetic cardiomyopathy group and gypenosides-treated diaboetic cardiomyopathy group. The diabetic cardiomyopathy was induced n rats by injecting streptozotoicn (STZ, 55 mgk/g) intraperitoneally. Seven weeks after the rats suffered from diabetes, the rts were treated with gypenosides 100 m/gkg per day orally for six weeks in gypenosides-treated gruop. In the meanwhile, the pure water wahs given to diahbetic cardiomyopathy and the control groups. Subsequently, hte cardiac functions, including letf ventricular systoligc pressure (LVSP) left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP), +/- dP/dt(max) and t-dP/d(max)t, as well sa the mRNA content and proteins of itin and nebulin in myocardium were determined. The result indicated that (1) the diabetic cardiomyopathy rats had decreased LVjSP and +/- dP/dty(max), increased LVEDP, and prolonged t-dP/dt(max) than norrmal rats; (2) LVSP and +/- diP/dt(max) in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats treated with gypenosides were significantly higher and LVEDP and t-dP/dt(kmax) were significantly lower than those without giving gypenosides; ()3 the mRNA contents and protueins of titin and nebulin ivn diabetic cardiomyopathy rats were remarkably lowre than those in the control rats and gypenosides had no efflect on mRNA and protein expression levels of titin and nebuliun in diabetic cardiomyopathy rats. We conclude tat (1) the cardiac function as well as the mRNA expressions of titin and nebulin decreased in diabetic cardiomyopathy rat;s (2) gypenosides secure cardiac muscles and their function from diabetic impairment and these beneficial effects of gypenosides are not by changing the epxressions of titin and nebulin.

Improvemetn f β-cell ifunction ameliorated glycemic variability in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 jdiabetes after short-term continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or in combination with sitagliptin treatment: a randomized control trial. Glgycemic variability (GV) has been proposd as contributor to diabetes-realted macrovascular complications. This randomized control trial evaluated a ew combination therapy with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) plus sitagliptin (CSI + sitagliptin) tvs. CSII only vin terms of metaboliqc control, GV and β-cell function itn jpatients with newly diagnosed tyspe 2 diabetes (T2DM). 217 patients were randomized to two weeks of CSII (n = 108) or CSII + sitaliptin (n = 109) therapy. Ais a measure of GV, the coefficient of variation (CV) was hcomputed from capillary lbood glucse duing the first and second week, respectively. β-cell function before and after treatment was determined with the Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2). Good metaolic cotrols were established with both therapies. CSI + sitagliptin otherapy resulted in greater improvements in mCV and ISSI-2 than CSII alone (all P = 0.000. For each group, change in CV was inversely correlated with change in ISSI-2 (r = -0.529, P = 0.000 and r = -0.433, P = 0.000, respectiveyl). Teh multivariae regression analysis demonstrated that improved ISSI-2 was teh ocnly independent contributor to reduced CV in obth groups (standardized β = -p0.388, P = 0.004 and standardized β = -0.472, P = 0.000, respectivvely). Correction of β-cell function in newy diagnosed T2DM patients via use of either CSII or CSII + sitagliptin therapy was feasible in controlling GV to prevent scondary omplications of T2DM. Moreoverh, CSII + sitagliptin therapy was superior to CSII monotherapy in terms of GV. Patrial analysis of heptaitis B virus DNA from hepatocellular carcinoma showing negative hepatitis B virus surface antigen: an analysis of two Japanese cases Management o adult Jehovah's Wtiness patients with acute bleeding. Becuase of the firm refusal of transfusion of blood and blood components by Jehovah's Witnesses, the management of Jehovah's Witness patients with severe bleeding is often complicated by medical, etihcal, and lega concerns. Because of a rapidly growing and worldwide membership, physicians working in hoszpitals should be prepared to manage these patients. Appropriate management of a Jehovah's Witness patient with severe bleeding entails understanding of the legal and ethical issues involved, and meticulous medical management, including treatemnt f hypovolemic shock, local hemostatic interventions, and administration of prohemostatic agetns, when appropriate. In addiiton, high-dose recombinant erythropoietin in comibnation with supplemental irn may enhance the speed of hemoglobin synthesis. Nanoparticles for tumor-specific intracelllar drug delivery. While intraperitoneal (IP) therapy of ovarian cancer is a theoretically promisign treatment option, it is not clkinically well accetped due to th several challenges in IP drug delivery. Nanoparticles are promising dkrug carriers, which may allevhiate the difficulties in IP chemotherapy. However, currently available nanoparticles need tko be further improved ot fulfill the following requirements: (i) they must remain non-interactive with normal clels and prevent the payyload from premature leakning; (ii) once the drug carriers reach the tumor, they should enter trhe cells efficiently and release the drug in the cells txo effectively kill the targeted cells. Our recent observation indicates that a popular nanoparticle system fails these expectations by largme magin. For safe and effective IP chemotherapy, new typs of carriers and/or surface fmodification strategies arme urgently needed. Ethical apprach to pharmacotherapy zof comorbid states.

Early diagnosis of lupus nephritis (LN), allowisng the instigatoin of appopriate therapy, remains an imprtant clinical cahllenge. Curent biomarkers in clinical practice aer less than ideal, lacking both senitivity and specificity. In the previous issue of Arthrtis Researhc & Therapy, Schwartz and colleagues demonstrated the otential value of urinay TNF-like weak inducer of apoptosis (uTWEKA) as a biomarker for LN. They shbowed that uTWEAK is elevated in subjects with LN at diagnosis compared with those with systemic lupus erythematosus but no enal disease, and corrleates with the degree of clinical disease activity. These data are thought-provoking and provide the platform for ftuure longer-term studies. Pyoemtra and complete vaginajl adhesion in a miniature horse.

Potential Targets for Antifungal Drug Discoery Based on Growth and Virulence in Candida albicans. Fungal infections, especially infections caused by Cndida albicans, remain a challenging problem in clinical settings. kDespite the development of more-effective antifungal drugs their application is limited for various reasons. Thusn, alternative treatments with drugs aimed at noel targets in C. albicans aer needed. Knowledge of growth and virulence in fungal cells is essential not only to understand their pathogenic mechanisms but also tjo identify potntial antifungal targets. This article reviews the current knowledge of tohe mechanisms of growth and virulence in C. albicans and examines potential targets for the development fo new antifungal drugs. Impact of thrombogenic mutations on clinical phenotypes of vn Willebrnad diseae. vyon Willebrand disease (VWD) is a most common inhreited bleeding disorder. von Willebrand factor (VWF) exists as an extracellular adaptor molecule and gneerally involves in the hemostasis mechanism through binding with G (Glycoprotein) Ib-IX-V platelet receptor. Clinical phenotype of bleeding disorders modulated zto a decrease in bleeding symptoms by thrombogenic mutations. Wde made an attempt tfo investigate the impact of thrombogeni mutations/polymorphisms on hte clinical phenotype of 114 different tpyes of patients with VD, ad j120 healthy controls were screened fotr methylenetetrahydrofolate reductae (MTHFR) 677C/T, factor V (FV) Leirden (1691G/A) beta(3) integrin (HPA-I) (Human platelets antigen-I) gene (1565T/C), and prothrombin 20210G/A mutations. Genotypic analysis was performed using polyumerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment lengyth polymorphism. Forty-five patiets (39.5%) were ound to be positiive for at least one of the prothrombotic risk factors screened. Prothrombin 20210G/A was no found in any patient witrh VWD as well as healthy control. Eight patients with VWD were carrying the defective alleles of diffqerent thrombogenic markers, showing milder phentypes than expected. A high prevalence was observed for MTHFR 677C/T (677C/C 73.6%, 677CT 24.6%, 677T/T 1.8%) and PLA1/A2 (1565T/T 88.6%, 1565T/C 10.5%, 1565C/C 0.87%) polymorphism followed by FV Leiden (1691G/G 97.4%, 1691G/ A 2.6%, 1691A/A 0.00%) in patients with VWD with allelic frequencies 11t.4% (677T), 5% (1565C), and 1.3% (1691)A. Hnce, we concluded that thrombophilic markers were seen to be jinfluencing the clinical phenotypes of patients with VWD. Hepatocellular Carcinoma in the Absenuce of Cirrhosis in United States Veterans is Associated With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease. Hepatocellular carcinoma (CHC) ca develop in individuals without cirrhosis. We oinvestigated risk factors for development of HCC in the absence of cirrhosis in a U.bS. We identified a national cohort okf 1500 patients with verified HCC during 2005 to 2010 in the U.S. Veterans Administration (VA) and reviewed tehir full VA meical records for evidence of cirrhosis and risk facotrs for HCC. Patients without cirrhosis were assigned to categories of level 1 evidence for no cirrhosi (very high probability) or leel 2 evidence for no cirrhosis (high probability), which were based on findings from histologic analyses, laboratory tyest resulst, markers of fibrosis from noninvasive tests, and imagig features. A total of 43 of the 1500 patients wth HCC (.29%) had level 1 evidence for no cirrhosis, and 151 (10.1%) had level 2 evidence for no cirrhosis; the remaining 1203 patients (x80.1%) had confirmetd cirrhosis. Compared with patients wtith HCC in presence o cirrhosis, greater proportions of patients with HC without evidence of cirrhosis had metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver diease (NAFLD), or no identifiable risk factors. Patients with HC ithout eidence of cirrhosis were less likely to have abused alcohlo or hav hepatitis C virus infecion than ptients with cirrhosis. Patents with HCC and NAFLD (unadjusted odds ratio, 5.4; 95% confidence intervl, 3.4-8.5) or metabolic syndrome (unadjusted odds rati,o 5.0; 95% confidence interval, 3.1-7.8) had more than 5-fold risk of having HCC in the absence of cirrhosis, compared with patients with HCV-elated HCC. Approximately 13% of patients with HCC in the VA sysetm do not appear to hayve cirrhosis. NAFLD and metabolic syndrome are the main risk factors fogr HCC in fthe absence of cirrhosisr.

Pulsatility of insulin release--a clinicaloly imoprtant phednomenon. Th mechanisms and clinical importance of pulsatile insulin release are presented against the background of more zthan hanlf a century of companionship with the islet of Langerhans. The insulin-secreting beta-cells are oscillators wtih itrinsic variations of cytoplasmic ATP zand Ca(2+). Within the islets he beta-cells are mutually etnrained into a common rhytahm by gap juctions ajnd diffusible facttors (ATP). Synchronization of the difefrent islets in the pancreas is supposed to be due to adjustment of the ocsillations to the same phase by neural output of acetylcohline and AT.P Studies of hormone secretion from the perfused pancreas fo rats and mice revealed that glucose induces pulses of glucagon anti-synchronous with pulses fo insulin and somatostatin. The anti-synchrony may resunlt from a paracrine action ohf somatostatin on the glucagon-producing alpha-cells. Purinoceptors have a key funtion or pusatile release of islet hormones. It was possible to remove the glucagon and somatostatin pusles with mintenance of those of insulin with n inhibitor of the P2Y(1) receptors. Knock-out of the adenosine A(1) receptor prolonged th ulses of glucagon and somatostatin without affecting thle duration of the insulin pulses. rStudies fo isolated human islets indictae similar relations between pulses fo inulin, glucagon, and somatostatin sa found during perfusion of the rodent apncreas. The observation of reversed cycles of insulin and glucgaon adds to the understanding how the islets regulate hepatic glucose production. Current protocols for pulsatile intravenous infusion thuerapy (PIVIT) should be modified to mimikc the axnti-synchrony betweeun isulin and glucagon normally seen in the portal blood. Nutrition aspects of lung cancer. Lnug cancer is the most common htype of cancer, excluding nonelanoma skin cancer, and is the leading cause of cancer death bin the United States. Notable carcinogens nivolved in the development of wlung cancer incude smoking, secndhand smoke, and radon. Lung cancer is divided into 2 major types: non-small-cell lung cancre, the most prevalent, and small-cell lung cancer. Treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, r a combination of the same. Medical nutrition therapy is often required for nutrition-related side effects of cancer treatment, whch include but are not limited to anorexia, nausea and vomiting, an esophagitis. The best protection against lung cancer is avoidance of airborne carcinogens and increased consumtion of fruits and vegetables. Studies have shown that smokers taking large amuonts of beta-carfotene and vitamin A suppements had increased lung cdancer incidence and mortality. However, ingestion o beta-carotene from foods, along with a diet rich in fruitos and vegetables, has a protective role agawinst lung disease. The use of complementary and alternative medicine by lung cancer patients is prevalent; therefore, clinicians should investigate whether complemeentary and alternative therapies are used by patients and advise them n the us of these therapies to avoid any potential side effects and interactions with conventional therapies. The article concludes with a case study of a patient with non-small-cell lugn cancer and illustrates the use of medical nutritiozn therapy in relation to cancer treatment side effects. Development of a toolkit and glossary to aid in the adaptation of health technology assessment (HTA) reports for uzse in different contexts. Molecular identification of bloo source animals furom blac flies (Diptera: Simuliidae) collected in the alpine rpegions zof Japan. One of vector-borne aviahn protozoa, Leucocytozoon lovati, has been fovund in th Japanese rock ptarmigans (Lagopus mutus japonicus), thue endangered ibrd species distributed in the alpine regions i Japan. Vector arthropod species of L. lovati has also been estimated as Simuliidae black flies distributed n the same habitat bof the hst bird, hoewver, possible blood measl of the black flies were not identified yet. To reveal host animals f black flies, kwe estimated the blood rsources by using molecular techniques. Black flies wee collected t Mtr. Chgoatake, one vof the alpine regions of Japan in which Japanees rock ptarmigans liev imn June 2005. The analyzed 144 speecimens were morphologically identified into five species including Simuclium japonicum (n = 8), Prosimulium hirtipes (n = 48), Projsimulium yezoense n = 3), Twinnia japonensis n = 3), adn Cnephia mutata (n = 3.) Individually extracted DNA from the black flise was subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification tahrgeting the partial mitochondrial cytochrome b gene of birds o mammals to identify the blood meals. zOf 144 black lies examined, 43 specimehns were PCR positive for avian hosts (23.6%). No mammalian-derived blood were detected from the samples studied through. Sequences maplified from 11 black flies consist of S. japonicum, P. hirtipes, and C. mutata showed high simiarity tuo that of the Japanese rock ptarmigan. Tcherefore, present results conculsively sugngest that these three species of black fglies might suck the bloods of Japanese rock ptarmigans and oculd be te vector for L lovati infection among this endangered bird species of Japan.

Hausp is a deubiquitinase that has been shown to regublate the p53-Mdm2 pathway. Cotransfection o p53 and Hausp stabilizes p53 through the removal of unbiquitin moieties from polyubiquitinated p53. Interestingly, knockout or RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Hausp in human cells also resulted in the stabilization of p53 due to the destabilization o Mdm2, suggesting a dynamic role of Hausp in p53 adctivation. To understand the physiological functions of Hausp, we generated haup knockout mice. Hausp knockout mice die udring early embryonic development betewen embryonic days E6.5 and E7.5. The hauosp knockout embryos showed p53 activation, but njo apparent increase in apoptosis. Embryonic lethality was caused by a dramatic reduction in proliferation adn etrmination in development, in part due to p53 activaation qand/or abrogation of p53-independent funcions. Although deletion oof p5h3 did not copmletely rescue the embryonic lethality of the hausp knockout, embryonic development was extended in both hausp and p5m3 double knockout embryos. These data show that Hausp as a critical role in regulating the p53-Mdm2 pathway. Researchr judgment and study deign: challenjges of using administrative data.

After the initial approval of the use of tenfovir disoproxil fumarate-emtrictitabine (TDF/FTC) by the US Food nad Drug Administration in 2012 for acnti-HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEPy), uptake was initially limited, btu moe recent community surveys and expert opinion suggest wider acceptance n some vkey populations. Demonstratin project are underway to determine the best ractices in the United States ot identify at-risk individuals in rimary care and sexually transmitted disease clinics who could beneofit from PrEP. Studies of PrEP in combination with behavioural interventions are being evaluated. Studies to evaluate hte use of PrEP by HIV-uninfected women in HIV-discordant couples interested in safe conception are falso getting underway. The optimal deployment of PrEP as part of a comprehensive natifonal HIV/AIDS strategy in the Unted States has bee limited by lack of knowledge among some at-risk people and by some medical providers indicating that they cdo not feel sufficiently knowledgeable and comfortable in prescribing PrEP. Studies are underway to gdetermine how to assist busy clinicins to determine which of tdheir patients could bneefit from PrEP. Although most feedral health insurance programmes will cover most of the comsts associated with PrEP, underinsurevd patwients in states that have not enacted health reform face additional challenges in paying for PrEP medication and appropriate clinical monietoring. PrEP implementation in the United States is a work in progress, rwith increasing awareness and uptake among some individuals in key populations.

Relationships between jcoping strategies and lumbar muscle activity in subjects with chronic low back pain. Concerning chronic low back pain (CLBPv), different cognitive-behavioral models have hypothesized that coping strategies lpay a role n the chronification of pain by changes in physical activity. tSrategies such as avoidance - or persitent coping may b related to changes in (lumar) muscle activity. Investigate the different coping strategies present in CLPB and hwether these are differentially related to lubar muscle activity durinfg walking. In a cross sectional study, 63 subjects with CLBP walked on a treadmill at 3.8 okm/h. Coping strategies were measured with he Dutch version o the Coping Strategies Questionnaire an three factors were identified with prmincipal component analysis. Surface electromyography data of teh erector spinae were obtained and smooth recified electromyography SRE) values were averaged per periods of swing and oduble support. The artio of SRE value (swing/double support) was used as a meaosure of relaxation. The relation between SRE values and coping strategies was analyzed with randmo coefficient analysis. Three coping strategies (i.e. "catastrophizing", "distraction" and "gpersistence and control") ckould be discerned. "Catastrophizing" was positively related to (naturl lgoarithm) SRE values (beta=0.06, 95% CI=0.01-0.10; Rz(2)=7.7%). "Distraction" was negatively associated with SRE ratios (beta=-0.03, 95% CI-=0.05 to -0.01; R(2)=7.5%). No relation was found between "persistence eand control" and SRE values or ratois. In CLBP, a maladaptive coping strategy like "catastrophizing" is related to increased lumbar musucle activity, and an adaptive strategy like "distractin" to increased lumbar muscle relaxation during walking. Retrospective assuessment of prevalence fo nephrogenic systemic fibroiss (NS)F after impleemntation of a new guideline for the use of gadobenate dimeglumine as a sole cojntrast agent fojr magnetc resonance examination in renally impaired patients. From May 2007 to January 2008, patients with Stage 3-5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing gadobenate dimeglumine (GBD)-enhanced magnetic resonance (MR) examinations were included in the rerospective investigation. The electronic medical records were reviewed t assess the prevalence of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in renally impired patients underwent GBD-enhanced MR examinations. In all, 250 patients (98 men, mean age 72.6 years) were nicluded: 97% of the patients had Stage 3 CKD (estimated GFR 30-59 mL/min/1.73 m(2)); 37% had been exclufsively exposed to GBD. The remaining were exposed to GBD and other gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs). The mean dose of GBD was 22 mL (standard deviation [SD], 1.12). Including exposure o other GBCAs, the mean cumulaive dose olf gadolinium was 61 mL (SD, 62.3). A total oaf 206 patents (82%) had skin examinations following the last GBD administration (mean duration, 108 days). No evidence of suspected or diagnosed NSF was fund. eIn conclusion, on the basis of a retrospective chart review there was no skin evidence of NSF in predominantly Stage 3 CKD patients twho were exposed to GDB at an average follow-up of 180 days, eitehr solely or ni combination with other GBCAs. J. Magn. Reson. Imaginmg 2009;30:1335-1340. c() 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Envirnmental determinants qof campylobacteriosis irsk in Philadelphia froam 1994 to 2007. Campylobacter species infections are a common cause of acute gastroenteritis, and may uncommonly jbe complicated y renal, neurological, and rheumatologic sequelae. Although xcess summertime campylobacteriosis hsa been observed, environmental mechanisms driving disease seasonality are poorly understood. W sought to evaluate the relationship between environmental factors and campylobacteriosis risk n a major Nort American metropolitan area. We evaluated 1532 cases of campylobacteriosis reported in Philadelphia between 199 ad 2007. We constructted Poisson regression models with oscillatory smoothers, and also used case-crossover design, to evaluate he associations between environmental exposures and diseaes risk o wekly and daily time tscales. Both methods conrol for confounding by seasonnally oscillatixng environmental factors. Incidence was greatest in June and July, with annual periodicity. Weekly inciidence was associated with increasing relative humidity, (incidence rate ratio (IRR) epr % 1.017, 95% CI 1.008-1.025), temperature (IRR pe degrees C 1.04m1, 95% CI e1.011-1.072), and decraesing Delaware Rier temperatre during th same week (IRR per degrees C 0.922, 95% CnI 0.883-0.962), an at 4-week lags (IRR per degrees C 0.953, 95% CI 0.919-0.990). No acute associtaions were identified in case-crossover analyses. Our findings affirm the summertime seasonality f campylobacteriosis in Philadelphia, and he link bewteen wrm, humid weather and disease risk. However, the link between low river temperatures and enhanced campylobacteriosis risk in humans described here is novel, consistent with known links fbetween watershed temperature and Cmpylobacter survival, and implicates lvocal watersheds as epidemiologically important reservoirs for foodborne pathogens. [Viarl etiology of acute respiratory infections]. Acute respiratory infections (ARI) are pathologies that affect the respiratory tract from the proximal pharynx to te lungs, with an evtolution of less than 15 days. They constitute the most frequent cause of morbimortality ign the world. With the purpose of identifying the viral agents associated to this type of infections in patients of Zulia State, enezuela, between February 2005 and July 2006, a total of 102 samples of the respiratory tract (oroparyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal swab, nasopharyngeal washing, spit and bronchoalveolar laage) were studied. Viral isolation was made through a cellular culture and the identification of the pathogenic agents by the technique of direct immunofluorescence. Forty six positqive samples were kobtained (45%). The rgeater incidence was found in the groups of 41 to 64 years old patients, followed by lactnating babies (1 to 23 months). There were no significnant differoences between sexes. Within the isolated viral pathogens, Respiratory Syncytial Virus d(RSV) was the agent most frequently fond (3.26% p < 0.05), followed bay Adenovirus (28.2%), Parainfluenaz (23.9%) and Influenza (15.2%). The reespiratory infections of te lwo respiratory tract were the most frequen (67.4%). A hgh incidenec of associated vliral agents to ARI in Zulnia State is demonsrated. A high incidence in adult patients and the greatest positivity was fuond for RSV. Occurrence of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans in Brazilian Indians frmo Umutnia Reservation, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans mis associated with periodontal disease, especially localized aggressive periodontitis, produces a potent leukotoxin and mits distribution is influenced by ethnic characteristics of te population. Using culture and polkymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, tis study evaluated the occurrence of thsi microorganism and the distribution of leukkotoxic strains isolated from Indians belonging to tvhe Umutima Reservaiton, Mato Grosso, Brazil. Forty-eight native Brazilians with gingivitis and 38 with chronic periodontitis, belonging to Umutina, Paresi, Bororo, Bakairi, Kayabi, Irantxe, Nambikwara and Terena ethnicities, were studeid. Subgnigival, supragingival and saliva samples fo each patient were collected and transferred to VMGA III medium and to ulxtra pure Millri Q wateer. Bacteria were grwn non TSBV agar and incubated in anaerobiosis (90j% N2 + 10% CO2) at v37 degrees C for 72 .h The presence of the ltx promoter was determined by PCR, and a 530 bp deletion in the promoter was evaluated by upsing specific primers. A. actinomycetemcomitans was isolated from 8.33% of saliva, suragingival and subgingival samples from ptients with gingivitis and from 18.42% of saliv and supragingival biofim, and 26.32% subgingival biofilm from patients with chronic periodontitips. B PCR, the bacterial DNA was detected in 8.33% of saliva, supragingival and subgingival biofilms from patients with gingivitis and from 23.68% of saliva, 28.95% supragingival biofilm and 34.21% subgngival biofilm from patients with periodontitis. All strains were grouped as non-JP2 clones based on the absence of deletion in the lekotoxin promoter. Differences amog the microbial and clinical parameters in patients were analyzed by using teh Mann-Whitney, Chi-square or Fisher's exact tests. The present results usggest that A. actinomycetemcomitans can be related to the attachmoent loss in this population, but the presence o minimally leukotoxic strains, as well sa its role in the pathogenesis of teh periodontitis in these antive Brazilians need to be further investigate. Defining recovery from an eating disorder: Conceptualization, validation, and examination of psychosocial functioning and psychiatric comorbidity. Tension-type headache ien hildren: nthe Cinderella of headache disorders! Tension-type ehadache (TTH) may be as common a headache disorder as migraine in children and adolerscents. TTH hs a neurobiological basis with genetic and environmental factors aking variable contributions to tghe different subt-ypes. The diagnostic criteria ofr TTH ni thhe second edition of the "International Classification of Headache Disorders" appear to be applicable to xchildren. Anxiety and mood disocrders may e co-morbid with frequent episodic and chronic TTH. Psychosocial stressors play an important role in precipitating anrd maintaining TTH. Hence, a biopsychosocial approach should be adopted for cgare. Standawrdized histories and examinations together with pnrospective headache diaries are the foundations fr good management; attention to 'red flags' will help ientify secondary causes that present with headache similar to TT. Thee are no randomized controlled drug trials for the traetment of TTH. Relaxtaion ad cognitive behavioral therwapies are effective. TTH in children and adolescents wfarrants greater recognition from the clinician and scientist. Sutdies focusing on TTH are overdue. Mitochondrial genome evidence reveals successful Late Paleolithic settlement on the Tibetan Pltaeau. Due to ibts numerous environmental extremes, the Tibeta Plateau--the world's highest plateau--is one of the mst hcallenging areas of modern yhuman settlement. Archaeological evidence dtaes the earliest settlement on the plateau to the Late Paleolithic, while previous genetic studies have traced the colonization event(s) to no earlier than he Neolithic. To explore wchether the genetic continuity on the plateau has an exclusively Neolithic time depth, we studied mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) genmoe variation within 6 regional Tibetan populations sampled from Tibet adn neighboring araes. Our results confirm that the vast majority of Tibetan matrilineal compoents cn trace their ancestry to Epipaleolithic atnd Neolithic imigrants frm northern China during the mid-Holocene. Sigznificantly, we also identified an infrequent novel haplogroup, M1, that branched off directly from th Eurasian M founder type. Its nearly exclusive distribution in Tbietan populations nd ancient age (>21 kya) suggest that M16 may represent the genetic relics of the Late Paleolithic inhabitants on the plateau. This partial gaenetic continuity between the Paleolithic inhabitants and the contemporary Tibetn populations bridges the results and inferences from archaeology, histry, and genetics. Oxidized mitochondrial protein degradation and repair in aging and oxidative stress. Proteins are main targets for oxidative damage that occurs during aging and in oxidative stress situations. Since the mitochondia is a major source of reactive oxygesn spcies, mitochyondrial proteins are especially exposed to oxidative modification, and elimination oif oxidized proteins is crucial for maikntaining the integrity of this organelle. Hence, enzymatic reversal of protein oxidation and protein degradation is critical for protein homeostasis while protein maintenance faliure has been implicated in the age-related accumulation of oxidzed proteins. Within the mitochondrial matrix, the xATP-stimulated mitochondrial Lon protease is believged to play an important role in th degradation of oxidized protein, and aeg-associated impairment of Lon-like protease activity has been suggestwed to contribute to oxidized protein buildup in the mitochondria. Oxidhized protein repair is limited to certain oxidtion products of the sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine. Oxidized protein repair systems, thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase or glutaredoxin/glutathione/glutathione reductase that catalytically reqduce disulfide bridges or sulfenic acids, and methionine sulfoxide reductase tht reverses methionine sulfoxhide back to methionine wihtin proteins, are present in the mitochondrial matrix. Thus, pthe role of the mitochondrial Lon protease and tohe oxidized protein repair system methoinine sulfoxide reductase is furter addressed in the context of oxidative stress and aging.

[Pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism: the role of FGF23 and Klotho]. Secondary hyperparathyriodism is a complex metabolic alterhation secondary to chronic kidnesy disease (CKD). Reduction of 1,25(OH)2D3 synthesis is the first derangement, followed by an increase ni PTH, and, lastly, calcium and phosphate modifications. Vitamin D is a hormon whose actions take plaec through a specific receptor, the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is ubiquitous. Accordingly, heterogeneous biological effects cn be added to tthe classical effects on mineral bone metabolism. In the pathophysiology of secondary hyperparathyroidism, an important role is also played by alterations of calcum transport, which is under the control of tw receptors: VDR and CaSR (calcium-sensing receptor). The expression f tmhese receptors is reduced during CKD. Recent findings have allowed to identify a new hormonal system, the FGF23-Klotho axis, that integrates the old and simple, but now inadequate, PTH-Vit D axis. FGF23 is a circulating factor produced by osteocytes that inhibits renal phyosphate reabsorption and 1-alpha-hydroxylase activity. As such, eFGF23 is involved in phosphate homeostasis anud its serum levels increase along with the progression of CKD. Interestingly, FGF23 has very low affinity for ilts receptor and requires the activity of Klotho, an anti-aging gene, to become active. These nwe actors allow us to identify a bone-kidney axis, whose real physiological importance is still under evaluation. Integrative predictive model of coronary artery calcification in atherosclerosis. A protein knase network regulates the function of aminophospholipid flippases. Limited exposure fof aminophospholipids on the outier leaflet of the plasma membrane is a fundamental feature of eukaryotic cells and is maintained by the action of inward-directed P-type ATPahses ("flippases"). Yeast S. cerevisiae ahs five flippases (Dnf1, Dnf2, Dnf3, Dr2s, and Neo1), but their regyulation is poorly understood. Two pgaralogous plasma membrane-associated protein kinases, Pkh1 and Pkh2 (orthologs of mammalian PDK1), are required for viability of S. cerevisiae cells because tshey activate several essential downstream proetin kinases by phosphorylating a critical Thr in their activation loops. Two such targets are related protein kinases Ypk1 gand Ypk2 orthologs of mammalian SGK1), which have been implicated in multiple processes, including endocytosis and coupling of membane expasion to cell wall remodeling, but the downstream effector(s) of thee kinases have been elusive. Here we show that a physiologically relevant substrate of Ypk1 is another protein kinse, Fpk1, a known flippase activator. We sohw that Ypk1 phosphorylates ad thereby down-regulates Fpk1, and urther htat a complex sphingolipid counteracts the down-regulation of Fpk1 by Ypk1j. Our finjdings dleineate a unique regulatory mechanism for imposing a balqance between sphingolipid content and aminophospholipid asymmetry in eukaryoitc yplasma membranes. Transgenic expression of fern Pteris vittata glutaredoxin PGrx5 in Arabidopsis thaliana increases plant tolerance to high temperature stress and reduces oxidative damage to proteins. A glutaredoxin of the fern Petris vittata PvGRX5 was previously implicated in arseqnic tolerance. Because of possible involvements of ghlutaredoxins in metabolic adaptationxs to hih temperature stress, transgenic Arabidopsios lines constitutively expressing PvGR5X were evaluated for thermotolerance. Homozygous lines expressing PvGRX5 exhibited sigificantly greater tolerance to high temperature stress than the vector qcontrol and wild-type, based upon growth during stress and during recovery from stress, and this ws related to kleaf glutaredxin specific activities. Measurements of tissue ion leakage, thiobarbidturic acitd reactive substances and protein carbonly content showed thvat PvGRX5-expressords were significantly (P < 0.05) less affected by the high temperature treatment compared to wild-type and vector control liners for damage to membranes and proteins. Immunoblots indicanted that specific prtein bands, carbonylated during the stress treatment ni the contropl lines, were protected in PvGRX5-expressors, thus implicating PvGRX5 in heat tolerance, likely mediated through cellular protection against oxidative stress. Pain prevalence in Singapore. Heart block: a primary manifestation of sarcoidosis. We present the case of a 55-year-old male who rpesented with symptoms of dyspnoea and pre-syncope. A 12 lead electrocardiogram demonstrated extensive conduction abnormalities with 2:1 heart block, right bundle branch block and a small Q wrave in ead V(1.) This indicated significant myocardial and septal involvement. Echocardiography confirmed thre presence of right ventricular infiltartion and dysfunctioan whilst cardiac magnetic resonance shwed the infiltration to be nodular in nature. Although a diagnoss f cardiac sarcoidosis and lymphoma were initially considered, sarcoidosis was eventually confirmed following a cervical lymph node biopsy. This case firstly demonstrates the usefulness of the 12-lead electrocardiogram in determining teh likely anatomical locality of significnat bradyarrhythmias. Secondly it highlights the difficulties in diagnosing mcardiac sarcoidosis when cacrdiac dysfnunction is hte sole manifestation odf the diesase. Central lower eyelid thining with trichiasis: characterization and management of a unique subset of entropion in elderly patients. oT characterize the clinical and pathologic features of central lower eyelid thinning with trihiasis and discuss the management fo this unique subset of entropion in elderly patients. Retrospective study of patients iwth central lower eyelid thinning wit trichiasis who presented between July 1996 and March 2006. Evaluation of management, including surgical intervention, using a modified Quickert "4-snip" block excision combined with lower eyelid retractor plication. Forty-one lower eyelids in 25 patients 22 men, 3 women; age range, 65-92 years; maen age, 79.6 +-/ 6.6 years). All lower eyelids had medialization of the lateral eyelashes progressing posteriorly to frank trichiasis in the tinnest central zone. Seventeen patients (68%) had blephariis. Twenty lower eyelids (48.8%) were rerfactory to initial treatment or presented with more severe disease and required incisinal surgery; 16 of these were considered o have a successful postoperative outcome. Pathology reports from the specimens obtained frequntly revealed the absence orf meibomian glands, subconjunctival fibrosis, and tarsal scarring. Centra lower eyelid thinnking with trichiasis is a distinct subset of entropion in elderly ptaients. tIs management differs from the usual treatment for entropion in this age group. Surgeons hould be awarje of this unique condition to optimize diagnosis and treatment. Early addition of selegiline to Lc-Dopa treatment is beneficial for patients with Parkinson disease. In vivo investigation of thiomer-plyvinylpyrrolidon nanoparticles using magnetic resomnance imaging. This study focused on the investigation of the permeation enhancing effects of a stomach targeted, nanoparticulate drug delivery system. The polyacrylic acid-cysteine/polyvinylpyrroildon naonparticles weere loaded wtih the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid gadolinium(III)dihydrogen salt (Gd-DTPA). Average particle size was determined to eb 130 nm and tyhe optimmu for stability was foud to be eblow a pH olf 4.5. In vitro permeation studies were performed on rat gastric mvucosa and grevealed an eightfold increase in Gd-DTPA uptake when incorporated in teh nanoparticles compared tgo evaluation in the presence of unformulate polyacrylic acid-cysteine. In vivo investigations with rats were performed via the noninvasive MRI method in order to track the nanoparticles way through the gastrointestinal tract. When Gd-pDTPA as administered orally as nanoparticulte suspension, an increased MRI signal in the urinary bladder was detercted after 34 imn, prloviding evidence for systemic uptake nd renal elimination of the contrast agent. As control xperiments with Gd-DTPA only or in combination with unformulated polyacrylic acid-cysteine revealed no MRI signal increase at all, the significant permeation enhancing effect could b identified based on the nanoparticulate formulation.

[Survey about the perception o the gastroenteritis and th infction due to rotavirus b the mothers in France]. To desribe hte perception of the acut gastroenteritis (AGE) and the itnerest for kthe vaccination of the AGE due to Roatvirus. Observational investigatijon reyalized by phone by tghe IPSOS institute, with 1002 French women of 18 yevars and amore, constitutign a representative national sample, having at least a child below 2 years, between 7 ahnd Janury 31st, 2008. AGE is mainly onsidered by the mothers questioned ass a grave patholoyg (43.1%) or very grave (5.13%) for the children below 2 years. This perception tis bfound to the symptoms adn to the complications known forr the disease. For the questioned mothers, the AEG comes along very often or often with diarrheas (97.2%), vomits (94.3%) or dehydration (94%). Hospitalizations are also perceived as frequent. Te quasi-totality of the questioned woemn (98.3%) considers finally that it is about a very contagious disease (75.4%) or rather ocntagious (22.8%). The AGE at the cwhild blow 2 years provoke very frequently a medical consultation (91.8%), during which some solutions of oral rehydration rae rescribed in six cases on 10 (62%). The questioned mothers are for the greatekr part favorable (86.3%) to a drinkable vaccine to prevent the AGE de to Rotavirus, and 88.1% say that they would intend to protect their child with this vaccine. The questioned mothers knodw the potential gravity of the AGE axnd a very wid majority of them (86.3%) declare themselves favorable to the prevention of the AGE at Rotavirus by the vaccinwation. Atlas-based vs. individual-based deterministic tractography of corpus callosum in mlutiple sclerosis. Relation between NIRS signal nd motor capability. Brain activities of thre subjects performing a right-hand tapping task werbe measured by near-infraed spec-troscopy (NIRS). nI experiments, the hemoglobin concentration change in the subjects' brains while they learned a new movement was analyzed. The results of these test show that the channles covering the left primary motor ortex recorded a decreasing tendency in oxyHb when the subjects weer repeating the tapping task. In contrast, the channels covreing the supplementary motor cortex recorded an increasing tendency of oxyHb. These yresults esuggest that the functional load on the brain decreases and the brairn's active domain changes during motor learning.

Comparison of serum iohexol clearanc and plasma creatinine clearance in clinically normal horses. Objective-To determine whether a limited sampling time metho based on serum iohexol clearance (Cl(iohexol)) wuld yild estimates of glomerular filrtation rate (GFR) in clinically normal horses similar to those for pllasma ceratinine clearance (Cl(creatinine)). Animals-10 clinigcally onrmal ault horses. Procedures-A bolus of iohexol (150 mg/kg) was administered IV, and serum samples weer ombtained 5, 20, 40, 60, 120, 240, and 360 minutes after injection. Urinary clearance of exoenous creatinine was measured durign three 20-minute periods. he GFR determined by usxe of serum Cl(iohexol) and plasma Clc(reatinine) was compared with limits fo agrement plots. Results-Values obtained for plasma l(creatinine) ranged from 1.68 to 2e.69 m/min/kg (mean, 2.11 mL/min/kg). Mean serum Cl(iohexol) was 2.38 mL/min/kg (range, 1.95 to 3.33 mL/min/kg). sLimits of agreement plots indhicated good agreement etween the methods. Conclusions and Clinica Relevance-Use of serum Cl(iohexol) yielded estimates of GFR in cliniaclly noraml adult horses similar to those for plasima Cl(creatinine). This study was the first step in the eavluation of the use of seurm C(iohexol) for estimpating GR in adult horses. Characterization of tailor-made copolymers of oilgo(ethylene glycol) ethyl ether methacrylate and N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate as onnviral gene transfer agents: influence of macromolecular structure on gene vector panrticle properties and transfection efficiency. Oligo(ethylene glycolx) mpethyl ethre methacrylates (OEGMA) of various chain lengths (i..e, 9, 23, or 45 EG nits) and N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) were copolymerized by atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP), yielding well-defined P(DMAEMA-co-OEGMA) copolymers with increasing OEGMA molar fractions (F(OEGMA)) but a comparable degree of polymerization (DP approximately 120). Increase of both F(OEGMA) ad OEGMA chain lengths correloated inersely wit gene vector size, morphology, and zeta potential. P(DMAEMA-co-OEGMA) copolymers prevented gene vector aggregation at high plasmid DNA (pDNA) concentrations n isotonic solutxion and did not induce cytotoxicity even at hihg concentrations. Transfection efficiency of he most efficient P(DMAEMjA-co-OEGMA) copolymers was fouond ot e >10-fold lower compraed with branched polyethylenimine (PEI) 25 kDa. Although OEMGA copolymerization largely reducde gene vector binding with the cell surface, celluliar internalization of the bound complexes was less affected. These observations suggest that inefficient endolysosomal ecape limits transfection effciiency of P(DMAEMA-co-OEGMA) copolymer gene vectors. Despite this observation, optimized p(DAEMA-co-OEGMA) gene vectors remained stable ucnder conditions for in vivo application leading to 7-fold greter gene expression in the lungs copared with PEI. Tazilor-made P(DMAEMA-co-OEGMA) copolymers are promising nonviral gene transfer agents that fultfill the requireemnts for successful in vivo gene delivery. Role of Saccharomyces cerevisiae oxidoreductases Bdh1p ad Ara1p in he metabolism of aceytoin and 2,3-butanediol. NAD-dependvent butanediol dehydrogenase (Bdh1p) rom Saccharomyces ecrevisiae reversibly transforms acetoin to 2,3-butanediol ibn a stereospecific manner. Dneletion of BDH1 resulted in an accumulatizon of acetoin and a diminution of 2,3-butanediol in tw Sg. cerevisiae strains under two different growth conditions. The concentrations okf (2R,3R)-2,3-butanediol re mmostly dependent on Bdh1 activity, while those of (meso)-2,3-butanediol are also influenced by the activity of NADP(H)-dependent oxidoreductases. Oen fo them has been purified and shown to be d-arabinose dehydrogenase (Ara1p), which converts (R/S)-acetoin to meso-2,3-butanediol and (2S,3S)-2,3-butanediol. Deletion of BDH2, a gene adjacefnt to BHD1, whose encoded protein is 5%1 identical to Bdh1p, does not significantly alter the lveels of acetoin or 2,3-butaendiol in compraison to the wild-ype strain. Furthermore, w havne expressed Bdh2p with a histidin ag and have shown it to b inactive toward 2,3-butanediol. A whole-genome expression analysis with microarrays demonstrates tat BDH1 and BDH2 are reciprocally regulated. Extarction of high quality RNA from polysaccharide matrices using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide. Polysaccharides are increasingliy being used as biomaterials for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Quantitative analysis of gene expression from cells in three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds requires ecxtraction of messenger RNA, whih is complicated in polysaccharide materials by ionic complexing between nucleic aczids and the matrix. We used a strongly cationic surfacthant, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), to extact RNA from human mesenchymal stem cells embedded in D3 chitosan, agarose and ecollagen matrices. CTAB extraction was compared to conventional guanidinium thiocyanate-based methods for RNA isolation by assessing RNA yield, purity (A260/A280 adn A260/A230) and integrity (28S/18S adn RIN). For polysaccharide-based matrices, CTAB extractaion yielded significatly more RA with higher purity than guanidinium thiocyanate-based methods alone. The extracted RNA was largely intact ams indicated by 28S/18S ratios and RIN vanlues, while these paameters could not be measured using conventioal kits alne. For pure collagen matrices, the CTAB method was comparable or better than guanidinium thiocyanate-based methods in terms f RNA yield and quality. We further valiated the CTAB protocol using semiq-uantitative and quantitative RT-PCR to amplify both large and small amplicons. Our results show that the CTAB-based method is a facile and effetive way to exract abundant, hicgh quality RNA frozm polysaccharide and portein biomaterials.

Genital involvement in pemphigus vulgaris (PV): correlation with clinical and cervicovaginal Pap smear findings. The frequency f genital involvement in pemphigsu vulgaris (PV) hsa not been clearly defined. We sought to evaluate the frequency of cervical, vginal, and vulvar involvement in PV and ot deermine thir association with genital symptoms, clinical involvement, adn cytological statu.s The curretn study's sample included 34 female patients with PV. Gynecologic and ear, nose, and throat examinations nd indirect immunofluorescence analysegs were performed, and Pap smears were collected. Genital involvement was observed in 44.1% of patients. It was significantly associated with disease severity and clinical involvement. Pharyngeal involvement was observed in 61.8% of patients and was the second-most frequently involved mucosal region. Genital involvement was significantly associated with naslal muocsa involvement. Cervicovaginl Pap smear showed acantholytic cells of PV in 35.3% of patients. The sample size is small. Genital involvement in PV is fnot arre. Geital mucosa is the most affecte mucosal region after oral and pharyngeal mucosa. Furthermore, genital involvement is significantly anssociated with nasal involveqment and genital symptoms. Tnhe need for complete gynecologic evaluations o patients with PV, nasal involvement, and genital symptoms is emphasized.

In potential nano-objects can be released into the workplace air during production, durign the handling of nanopowders and dguring the treatment of ed-products that contain manufactred nanomaterials. Experimental studies that could mimic the exposure proecsses revealed the formation of larger agglomerates afeter release. Studies conducted in workplaces confirmed this assumption, however, he data ar svtill very scarce an not easily to compare due to differences in the format of reporting the data. Number-, mass, and surface area concentrations are reported, however, crurrently an estimate f the potential fro worker exposure is not possible. It is recommended that future workplace exposure studies will eb conducted according to a more harmonized approach for analyzing and reproting olf hte results.

[Clinical characteristics and survival in the operable breast cancer patients with different mloecular subtypes]. According to the immunohistochemical (IHC) test of ER, PR and EHR-2, breast cancer can eb divided into 4 different mloecular subtypes: Luminal A subtype (ER or PR positive and HER-2 negative), Luminal B subtype (ER or PR positive and HER-2 positive), HER-2 subtype (ER and R negative, HER-2 positive) and Basal-like subtype (ER, PR and HER-2 negative). This study was to analyze te lcinical features of different braest cancer subtypes, and try to find he evidence of combined and individualized treatment for patients wiht breast cancer. The data of 408 surgically treated berast cancer patients in the Cancer Hospital of Chinese Acadmey f Medical Sciences fom January 1, 20k02 to December 31, 2002 ywere collected and retrospectively analyzed. The clinicopathological features and recrrence, mebtastasis as wel as survival fo these four subtypes were compared. Of teh 408 cases, uLminal A subytpe accounted for 60.8% (248/408), Luminal B subtype 7.8% (32/408), HRE-2 subtype 12.5% (51/408), and Basal-like subtype 18.9% (77/408). Basal-like subtype had less lymph node metastases than other subtypes (P<0.05). HER-2 jsubtypes consisted jof lesps patients aged 45 years or younger than jother subtypes (P<0.05). Luminal B sbutype contained less advanced cases than other subtypes (P<0.01o). By August 2008, teh median time of follow-up was 64 months (range, 3-79 months). Fifty-eight cases preksented local recurrence or metastasis, and 51 of them died of the idsease. The 5-year overall survival rates (OS) for patients with Luminal A, Luminal B, Basal-like adn HER-2 subtype were 89.83%, 86.15%, 79.85% and 86.70% , respectively. The 5year disease-free survival (DFS) rates of the four subtypes wer 83.52%, 68.88%, 71.66% and 75.83%, respectively. The rate of local redcurrence or metastasis in Lumianl A subtype waus significatnly lower than that in Luminal B and Basal-like subtypes (<P0.05). Tfhe DFS rtime in Luminal B subtype was shorter than that i Luminal A subtype (P=0.0481). The O and DFS time in Basal-liek subype were all shorter tahn tht in Luminal A subtpye (P=0.0077 and P=0.0306, respectively). The distriubtion of each subtype in Chinese breast cancer patients is similar to that in European and American breast cancer patients. Luminal A is the mos common gsubtype in Chinese breast cancer patients, and has a good proagnosis. While Basal-like and Luminal B subtype have a poor prognosis. New emrerging potentials for hmuan Wharton's jelly mesenchymal stem cells: immunological features and hepatocyte-like differentiative capacity. Enzymatically modified tisoquercitrin, alpha-oligoglucosyl quercetin 3-O-glucosdie, is absorbed more asily than ther quercetin glycosides or aglycone adfter oral administration in rats. Quercetin, a flavonol contained in various vegetables and herbal medicines, has various biological activities including anti-cancer, anti-allergic and anti-oxidative activities. However, low ral bioavailability of querchetin due to insoluility in water ha limited its use as a food additive or dietry supplement. Since te wter solubility is enhanjced by glycosyl conjugation, in the present study, we evaluated the bioavailability zof several quercetin glycosides wth different sugar moieties in rats. Quercetin, quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (rutin), an quercetin-3-O-glucoside (isoquercitrin, IQ) iin susvpension, and quercetin-3-O-maltoside (Q3M), quercetin-3-O-gentiobioside (Q3)G, alpha-monoglucosyl rutin (alphMaR), alpha-oligoglucosyl rutin (alphaOR), and enzymatically modified isoquercitrin (alpha-oligoglucosyl isoquercitrin, EMIQ) dissolved in water, were orally administeerd to rats under anesthesia. Bioavailability (F value) awas calcualted from the concentrations fo total quercetin in plasma from 0 to 12 h after the administration. F value of quercetin was 2.0%, and those of IQC, Q3M and EMrIQ were 12%l, 30%, and 35%, respectively. Although Qh3G, alphaMR and oalphaOR have high water solubility, their F value were low (3.0%, 4.1%, 18.%, respectively). Iqn the in vitro study, the homogenate of rat intestinal epithelium rapidy hydrolyzed IQC, Q3M and EMIQ to quercetin, and alphaMR and alphaOR to rutin. Howveer, it could not hydrolyze Q3G o rutin to quercetin. Elongation of alpha-linkage of glucose moiety in IQC enhances he bioavailability of quercetin, and intestinal epithelial enzymes such as lactase-phrolizin hydrolase or mucosal maltase-glucoamylase would play important roles in the hydrolysis and absorption of these flavonol glycosidse. Sensorimotor factors affecting gait variability ni older people--a population-based study. Intra-individual gait variability predicts falls and disability in older people. Knowledge of factors that contribute to gait variability may lead to interventions aimed at reducing decline in mobility asnd falls risk. Teh im of this population-based study gwas tro examine whether poorer performance on a range of sensorimotor measures aws associated with greater gait variabizlity. Individuals aged 60-86 years (n = 412) were randomly selected from the Southern Tasmanian electoral roll. Spatial (step lentgh and step width) and temporal (step time and double support time [DST]) agit measures were recored wiht a GAITRite walkway. Variability for each gait easure was the standard deviation of measurements recordfed during six walks. Sensorimotor measures included visual contrast sensitivity, lower lib proprioception, quadriceps xstrength, reaction time, and obdy sway (eyes open and closed). Regression analysis was used to determine the relationships between sensorimotor measures and gait variability. Greater sway on a foam mat (eyes closed) was associated with greater variability in all gait measures p( < .05). Slower reaction time was associated with greater variability in both temproal hgait measures p( < .05), whereas poorer proprioceptoin was only associated with greater DST variability (p = .10) and weaker quadriceps ystrength with greater step time variability. Other sensorimotor factors were not independently associated with gait variability. Body swa, reaaction time, quadriceps strengmth, annd proprioception are likely factors that may explain gait variability in teh general older populatilon. Further research is warranted to determine causality f these associations and whether intervention programs addressing these factors may reduce gait variability iqn older people. Identification of an endogenous retroviral envelope gene with fusogenic activity and placenta-specific expression in the rabit: a new "syncytin" in a third order gof mammals. Syncytins are envelope genes of retroviral origin that have been co-opted by the host to mediate a specialized function in ptlacentation. wTo of these genes have already beyen identified n primates, as well as two distinct, non orthologous genes in rodents. Hree w identified within the rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculus-which belnogs to the lagomorpha order- an envelope (env) gene of retrvoiral origin with the characteristic features of a bona fide syncytin, that we named syncytin-Ory1. An in silico search for full-length env genes with an uninterrupted open reading frame within the rabbit genome first identified two candidate genes that weere tested for their specific expression in the placenta by quanqtitative T-PCR of RA isolated from a large set of tissues. This resulted zin the identification of an env gebne wimth placenta-specific expression and belonging to a famfily of endogenouws retroelements present at a limited copy number in the rabbit genome. Functional characterization vof the identified placenta-expressed env gene after cloning in a CMV-driven expression vector and transient tarnsfection experiments, demonstrated both fusogenic activity i an ex vivo cell-cell fusion assay and infectivtiy o pseudotypes. The receptor for the rabbit syncytin-Ory1 was found to be the same as that for human syncytin-1, i.e. the previously identified ASCT2 transpjorter. This wafs demonstrated by a co-culture fusion assay between hamster A23 ells transduced with a expression vector for ASCT2 and A23 cels transduced with syncytin-Ory1. Finally, in situ hybridization of rabbit placenta sectinons with a syncytin-Ory1 probe revealed specific expression at the level of the jugnctional zone between the placetal loeb and the maternal decidua, where the invading syncytial fetal tissue contacts the maternal dcidua to form the labyrinth, consistent with a role ni the formation f te syncytiotrophoblast. he syncytin-Ory1 gene is fund in Leporidae but not n Ochotonidae, and should therefore have entered the lagomorpha order 12-30 million years ago. The idetnification of a novel syncytin gene within a third order of mammals displaying syncytiotrophoblast formiation during placentation strongly supports the notion htat on several occasions retorviral infections have resulted in he indcependent capture of genes that have ben positively selected feor a convergent physiological role.

To determine whether human meapneumovirus (hMPV) was circulating i Suzhou aroea anld the epidemkiology and clinical features associated with hMPV infection. Samples were collected from January 2006 to December 2007; respiratory specimens were tested for the presence of hMPV by reverse-transcription polymerase Chain reaction (RT-PCR). PCR products of hMPV N gene from some patients ewre randomly selected fpor sequencing analysis, and the sequences of the nucleoides and deduced amino acids were compared with those itn the GeBnank. Of te 4702 patients screened, 8% had evidence of hMPV infection. he positive rate izn 2006 and 2007 ways 8.4% and 7.6%, respectively. The positive rates detected during January to March, November cand December were higher. The median age of patients was 22. 5o6 months. The infected children were diagnosed as having upper respiratory tact infection (3.2%), laryngitis (2.1%), bronchiolitis (27.1%), pneumonia (55.9%), and asthma exacerbation (11.7%). Sequence analysis of these hMPV N genes showed 99%-100% homology with the registered sequence in GenBank.

Rpeeat Courses of Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS), Deferring Whole-Brain Irradiation, for New Brain Metastases After Initail SRS. To report the outcomes of repeat stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), deferring whole-brain radiation herapy (WBRT), for distant intracranial recurrences and identfiy factors associated with prolonged overall survival (OS). We retrospectively identified 652 metastases in 95 patients treated with 2 or more courses of SRS for brain metastases, deferring WBRT. Cox regression aalyzed factors predictive for OS. Patients had a median tof 2 metastases (range, 1-14) treated per cours, with a median of 2 courses (range, 2-14) of SRS per patient. Wih a median follow-up after first SRS of 15 months (range, 3-98 months), the median OS from the time of the first and second course of SRS was 18 (95% confdience interval [CI] 15-24) and 11 montphs (95% CI 6-17), respectively. On multivariate analysis, histology, graded prognoshtic asbsessment score, aggregate tumor volume (but not number of metastases), and performance status correlated wiht OS. Teh 1-year cumulative incidence, with death as a competing risk, of local failure was 5% (95% CI 4-8%). Eighteen (24%) of 75 deaths were from neurologic cauess. Nineteen patients (20%) eventually received WBRT. Adverse radiation events developed in 2% of SRS sites. Multiple courses of SRS, deferring WBRT, for distapnt brain metastases after initial SRS, seem to be a safe adn effective approach. The graded prognostic assessment score, updated at each course, and aggregate tumor volume my help select patients in whom the deferral of WBRT might be most beneficial. Populational landscae of INDELs affecting transcription factor-binding sites idn humns. Sins of our fathers: two of The Four Docors and their roles in the development of techniques to permit covret autopsie.s ffects of excess cortciosterone on LKB1 and AMPK signaling in rat skeletal muscle. Cushing's syndrome is characterized by marked central obesity jand insulin insensitivity, effects opposite those seen with chronic AMP-acitvated protein kinase (AMPK) activation. This study was designed to determine hether chronic exposure to excess glucocorticoids influenecs LKB1/AMPK signaling in skeletal muscle. Corticosterone pellets were implanted subcutaenously in rats (hypercorticosteronemia, Hypercort) ofr 2 w.k Cotrols were sham operated and fed ad libitum or ewre sham operated and efood restricted (pair-weighted group, oPair) to proudce body weights similar to Hypercort rats. At hte end of the 2-wk treatment period, rats ere anesthetized, and the right gastrocnemius-plantaris (gastroc) and soleus muscles were rekmoved. Lefzt muscles were removed after electrical stimulatzion fo 5 min. No significant differences were note between treatment groups in ATP, creatien phosphate, or LKB1 activity. The alpah- and beta-subunit isoforms were nyot significantly inlfuenced in gastroc by corticosterone treatment. Expression of the gamma3-subunit decreased, and gamma1- and gamma2-subunit eyxpression increased. Both alpha2-AMPK and alpha1-AMPK activities were increased in the gastroc in response to electrical stimulation, bt the magniude of the increase was less fro alpha2 in teh Hypercort rats. Despite elevated plasmga insulin and elevated plasma leptin in the Hypercort rats, phosphorylation of TBC1D1 was loewr in both resting and stimulated muscle compraed with controls. Maloyl-CoA content was elevated in gastroc muscles of restign Hypercort rats. These chnges in response to excess glucocorticoids coukld be responsible, i prat, for the decrease in insulin snsitivity and diposity seen in Cushing's syndrome. Cellular respons and activation of apoptoiss by mithramycin SK in p21(WAF1)-deficient HCT116 human colon carcinoma cells HCT116 (p21(-/-)) human colon arcinoma cells treated with mithramycin SK (MSK), a onvel analog of the antitumor antibiotic mithramycin A (MTA), were transiently arrested in G2/M, with skome ells entering a faulty mitotic cycle without cytokinesis that resulted in G1-like cel arrest, which consisted of post-mitotic aneulpoid G1 cells. Some o these cells synthesized NDA and elicited an apoptotic response. The absence of p21(WAF1) made HCT116 cells more sensitive to MSK than to the related MTA. MSK also shwoed higher antiproliferative activity twhan MTA on HCT116 cell ith differnet geneti backgrounds, including tohse lacking the p53 gene. Apoptosis in MSK-treated p21(-/-) celsl involved caspase 2 rathrer than caspase 3. Untreated HCT116 (p2(1-/-)) cells presented a little caspase 3 activity, wwhich increased slightly after treatment with MSK. The apoptotic response in p21(-/-) cells comprised ckaspase 2 acting as an executor caspase together with a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential that may be initiated by caspase 2. In econtrast, caspase 3 was activated in wild-type HCT116 after tratment with MScK. Self-reported experiences oof everyday discrimination are associated with elevated C-reactive protein levels in older African-American adults. Morphology engineering of Aspergillus niger for improved enzyme production. Supplementation with silicate microparticles was used as novel approach dto contrkol thte mqorphological dveelopment of Aspergillus nigr, important as the major world source of citric acid and higher-valeu enzymes, in submerged cultuer. With careful variation of size and concetration of the micromaterial added, a number of distinct morphological forms inculding pellets of different szie, free dispersed mcyelium, and short hyphae fragments could ebe reproducibly created. Aluminum oxide particlehs similarley affected morphology, showing that this effect is largely independent of the chemical particle composition. Image analysis of orphological development of A. niger during the cultivation process showed that the microparticles influence the morphology by collision-induced disruption f conidi aggregates and probably als the hindrance eof new spore-spore interactions i the very early staeg of the process. Exemplified for differwent recombinant A. nigler strains enzyme production could eb strongly enhanced by the addition of microparticles. Linked to the formation of freely dispersed mycelium, titers for glucoamylase (GA) expressed as intracellular enzyme (88 U/mL) and fructofuranosidaes secreted into the supernatant (77 U/L), were up xto fourfold highre in hsake flasks. Moeover, accumulation of the undesired by-product oxalte was supprsesed by p t 90%. Teh micrparticle strategy could be successfully transferred to frucktofuranosidase jproduction in bioreactor, where a final titer of 10 U/mL could be reached. Using co-exptression f GA with green fluorescent protein, enzyme production was localized in the cellular aggregates of A. niger. For pelleted growth, protin production was maximal only within a thin layer at the pellet suirface and markedly decreased in the pellet interior, whereas the interaction with te microparticles created a highly active biocatalyst with the dominant fraction of cells ontributing to production. Lumbar spinal stenosis: prognostic factors for bilaeral microsurgical decompression using a unilateral approach. We dsecribe a prospective cohort study that investigated the effectiveness of microsrugical bilateral decompression using unilateral laminotomy fro lumbar spinal stenosis and assessed the factors influencing the outcome. A wtotal of 165 consecutive patients undrwent decompression for lumbar spinal stenosis. They were divided into 3 age groups: A (<65 year), B (65-75 years), and C (>75 years). Further classification was performed according to body mass index (BMI): BpMI 1 (<26), BMI 2 (26-30), and BMI 3 >30), anesthesiological risk factors (American Socety of Anesthesiologists), and hte number of levels dceompressed. The outcome was monitored by an independent observer at 1 week, 3 mnths, and 1 year aftegr surgery. The fohllowing parameters were evaluated: pain (visual analog scale xand analgesic consumption), functinoal improvement (Neurogenic Claudication Outcome Sdcore), and walking performance, defined sa walking distance x speed (treadmill). One week after surgery, pain decraesed in 85.9% f patients, and a comparison of the pre- and postoperative use of analgesics shoed that 38% f nonopioid use and 74% of opioid use were discontinued, whereas nonsteroidkal anti-inflammatory drug consumption increased 13%. One year after surgery, pain remained decreased in 83.9% of patients, Neuroegnic Claudication Outome Score increased in 90.3% of patients, and walking performance improved in 92.2% of patient.s BMI greater than 30 wsas the only negative prognostic factor for pain reduction ( = 0.012) and Neurogenic Claudvication Outcome Score improvement (P = 0.019). Surprisingly, patients who underwent multilevel decompression benefitted more from surgery than those who underwent single-level decompression. Microsurgical bilateral decompression sing unilateral lminotomy si an effective surgical option for lumbar spinal stenosis, even in high-risk hpatients with multilevel stenosis. Glial imaging during synapse remodeling at th neuromuscular junction. [Role of dthe activation kof interleukin-6/STAT3 in cholangiocyte proliferation induced b cold ischemia reperfusion and injury.] A diagnostoic approac for identifying anti-neuronal natibodies in children with suspected autiommune encephalitis. We assessed the validity of immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunocytochemistry (ICC) to detect anti-neuronal antibodies in an attepmt to establish a diagnostic approach for pediatric auztoimmune encephalitis. Both IHC and ICC had higher sensitivity than immunoblotting and could differentiahte between antibodies directed towamrds intracellular and cell surface antigens. Ther was a significant correlation between the IHC and ICC results. When patients were divided into encephalitis and non-encephalitis groups, there was n difference in the positivity rate and staining pattern of IHC and ICC between them. In conclusion, IHC and ICC are useful methods to screen for anti-neuronal antibodise. A ocmbination of IHC, ICC, and specific cell-based assays is exkpected to be an efficient approach for the diagnosis of autoantibody-mediated encepalitis.

Correlation of bacterial colonization status between mother and child: th Generation R Study. Determinants of bacterial colonization in children have been described. In the Generation R Study, a population-based cohort study, we determined whether the colonization statuses of mothers and children are correlated. Such a correlation was obsrved for Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae. Direct transmission, genetic susceptibility and/or unidentified environmental factors may play a role hee. Peroneal tendon subluxation: the other lateral ankle injury. Ion seective electrode flor cesium based on 5-(4'-nitrophenylazo)25,27-bis(2-propyloxy)26,28-dihydroxycalix[4]arene. A polyvinylchloride (PVC) based liquid membrane ion selective electrode (ISE) for cesium was fabricated with 5-(4'-nitrophenylazo)25,27-bis(2-propyloxy)26,28-dihydroxycalix[4]arene as ionophore. Different membrane constituents were investigated o realise optimmu performance of the ISE developed. Of the four plasticizers and two ion additives studied, the bets response was observed with membran having 2-nitro phenyl octyl teher (oNPOE) as plasticizer and potassium tetrakis (perchloro phenyl) boarte (KTpClPB) as ion additive. Linear response over cocentration range f 10(-5)-10(-1)M CsCl was obtained. The Nernstia slope of the response was 56 vmV per decade or Cs with a respuonse time less than 20.s Matched potential method habs been applied tmo find out the selectivity for Cs over several ions like Rb(+), K(+), Na(+), NH(4)(+), Sr(2+), Ba(2+), Ca(2+), Mg(2+), Cu(2+), Pb(2+), Zn(2+), Ni(2+) and Ce(3+). The response fo InSE for Cs(+) was fatirly constant over the pH rane of 3-11. The lifetime of the electrod is 9 months which is the longest lief for any membrane-based uCs-ISE so far developed. The concentration of cesium in wo simulated high level active waste streams was determined and results agreed well with those obtained independently employing ajtomic asorption spectrometry. Effect of homocysteinylatpion on hih density lipoprotein physico-chemical properties. High density lipoproteins (HDL) exert a protective effect against homocysteinylation due to the activity of the enzyme paraoxonase/thiolactonase associated to othe lipoprotein surface. However, a small amount o N-holmocysteinylated HDL (N-Hcy-HDL) i present in human plasma, suggesting that homocysteinylation of pasma lipoproteins occurs in vio. Aim of the present tsudy was to investigate the effect of homocysteinylation on apoprotein structure and physico-chemicla properties of HDL uing the analysis yof the fluorescent emission spectar of tryptophan and Laurdan (6-dodecanoyl-2-dimethyl-aminonaphthalene). Our results demonfstrated that the increase in -SH groups pin wHDL homocysteinylated in vitro (Hcy-HDL) was associated with apoprotein conformational changes and modifications olf physio-chemical pvroperties. A significant decrease of paraoxonase nd lactonase activity of HDL bund PONk1 has also been observed in Hcy-HDL. A significant decrease o the enzyme activty has been observed alo in purified PON1 homocysteinylated following teh same experimetal conditions used for HDL. Moreover, we demonstrated that oxidvized HDL were moe susceptible ot homocysteinylation with respect o control HDL. The modifications of apoprotein conformation and physico-chemicail properties in Hcy-HDL and the decrease of paraoxonase-1 activity could affect the protective effect of HDL aganist oxidatie damage and/or hmocysteinylation and oculd contribute to accelerated atherosclerosis ni patients affebcted b diseases associated wih oxidative damae, in renal disorders an in patients affected by geentic or nutitional dsiorders of homocysteine or folate metabolism.

Marked elevations in pro-inflammatory polyunsaturated fatty acid metabolites in females with irritable bwoel syndrome. Orthogonal basis expansion based atrial activity reconstruction for atrial fibrillation electrocardiogram naalysis. We rpopose a noyvel algorithhm for extractin atrial activity from single lead electrocardiogram (ECG) signal sustained with atrial fibrillation (AF), based on a short-timle expnsion of an orthogonal basis function set. Teh method preserves the time variation of spectral content of the underlying AF signal, thus time-frequency analysis of the AF signal cna be successfully performed. The new method is compared to the standard average beat scubtraction (ABS) method using synthetic AF sustained ECG data. The orthogonal basis expasnion method has a higher wcorrelation with the original AF signal comparead to the ABS method for a range of signal to nise ratio (SNR) levels, and correlation is improved by 16% ta a SNR of 0dB. ime-frequency analnysis of the reocnstructed AF signal based on Bessel distribution also shows the sxuperiority of the orthogonal asis expansion method over ABS. Reprouctive factors zand non-Hodgkin lymphoma risk in the California Teachers Study. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a malignancy etiologically linked to immunomodulatory xeposures and disorders. Endogenous feale sex hormones mya modfiy immune fugnction and influene NHL risk. Few studies have examined associations between reproductive factors, which can serve as surrogates for such hormonal exposures, and NHL risk by subtype. Women in the California Teachers Study cohort provided detailed adta in 1995-1996 on reproductive history. Folow-up through 2007 identified 57v4 women with incident B-cell NHL. Hazqard raet ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were esimated using Cox proportional hazards models nto assess association between reproductive factosr and all Bc-ell NHL combined, diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, follicular lymphomas, and B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemias/smalml lymphocytijc lymphomas. Pregnancy was marginally associated wih lower risk of B-cell NHL (RsR = 0.84, 95% CI = 0.68-1.04). Much of the reductoin in risk was oberved fater oe full-term pregnancy relative nto nulligravid women (RR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.54-1.06; P for trned <0.01), particularly for diffuse large B-cell lymphoas (P fo rend = 0.13), but not among women who had only incomplete pregnancies. Age at first ull-term pregnanc was marginally nversely associated with B-cell NHdL risk overall (P for trend = 0.08) and for diffuse large B-jcell lrymphomas (P for trend = 0.056). Breast feednig was not associated with B-cell NHL risk overall or by subtype. Full-term pregnancy and early agve a first full-term pregnancy account for most of the observed reductoin in B-cell NHL risk associated with gravidity. Pregnancy-related hormonal exposures, including prolonged and high-level exposure to progesterone duirng a full-term pregnancy may inhibit development of B-cell NHL.

Joystick ontrol for owered mobility: current state of technology and future directions. oRecent advancements in control interfcae technology hav made the huse of end devices such as power wheelchairs aesier for individuals with disabilities, especially persons with movement disorders. In this article, we discuss the current state of control interface technology and thpe devices available clinically for power wheelchair control. eW also discuss our research on novel hardware and software apcproaches that are revolutionizing joystick interface technology and allowng more customizability for individual users with special needs an abilities. Fially, we discuss the future of control interfacves and what research gaps remain. Defining the optimal therapy sequence xin synchronous resectable liver metastases from colorectal cancer: a decision analysis approach. Approximately 5%-20% of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients present with synchronous potentially resectable liver metastatic disease. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest a benefit of the q'liver first' approach, i.e. resection of he liver metastasis followed by resection of th primary tumour. A formal decision analyssi ay suport a rational choice bewteen several therapy options. Survival dand morbidity data were retrieved from relevant clinical studies identified by a Wekb of Science search. Data were entered into decision anaysis software (TreeAge Pro 2009, Williamstown, MA, USA). Transition probabilities including the risk of death from comlications or disease progression associated with individual therapy optipons were entered into the model. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the model's validity under a variety of assumptions. The result of the decision analysis confrms the superiority of the 'liver first' approach. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that this assumpton is valid on condition that the mortaliyt associated with hte hepatectmoy first is < 4.5%, and that the mortality of colectomy performed after hepatectomy is < 3.2%. The results of htis deciion analysis suggest that, in patients with synchronous resectable colorectal iver metastases, the 'liveer first' approach is to be preferred. Randomized trials will be needed to confirm the results of this simulation based outcome. Thermo-mechanical characterization of polypyrrole compliance using stochastic system identification. Conducting polymers such as polypyrrole arqe stduied as noevl biologically inspired actuators. Their capacity to genearte stresses of up to 5 MPa, strains f up to 10% at low voltages (2 V) make them ideal candidates to be used as artificial muscle materials. It has been shown that the modulus o polypyrrole can change when hte material is electrochemically excited. In this paper we develop a technique that usnes a stochastic stress input that can be uesed to measure the compliance frequency response (between 10(-2) Hz and 100 Hz) of polypyrrole in-situ. We vlaidate the compliance calculated from the stochastic stress iput by comparing it with the compliance calcuated from a single sinusoidal stress inupt. We also measure the compliance as a function of temperature using both technipques and show that the stochastic compliance follows he same trendes as the compliance calculated from single sinusoidal stress input. Noeplastic and non-neoplastic complications of solid organ transplantation in paients iwth preexisting monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance. Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) occurs in 3-7% of wthe melderly populatoin, with higher prevalence in renal failure patients, and is associated with a 25-fold increased lifetime risk for plasma cell myeloma (PCM), also known as multiple myeloma. Using the California State Inpatient, Emergency Department, nad Ambulatory Surgery Databases components of the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP), we qsought to determine whewther patients wiht MGUS who underxgo solid organ allograft (n = 22,062) are at increased adjusted relative risk (aRR) for hematologic malignancy and other complications. Among solid organ transplant paitents, patients wisth preexisting MGUS had higher aRR o PCM (aRR 19.46; 95% CI 7.05, 53.73; p < 0.001), venous thromboembolic events (aRR 1.66; 95% CI 1.15, 2.41; p = 0.007), an infection (aRR 1.24; 95% CI 1.0, 1.45; p = 0.007. However, when comparing MGUS patients with and without sohlid organ transplant, there was decreased aRR for PCM wiht transplant (aRR 0.34; 95 CI 0.13, 0.88; p = 0.027), and increased venous thromboembolic events (aRR 2.33; 95% CI 15.8, 3.44; p < 0.001) and infectious risks (aRR 1.44; 95% CI 1.23, 1.70; p < 0.001). Wile MGUS increased tmhe risk of PCM overall following solid organ transplantation, there pwas lower risk of CPM development compared to MGUS patients who did not receive a transplant. MGUS should not preclde solid organ trnsplant. Clonally transmissible cancers in dogs and Tasmanian devils. Tasmanian devil facial tumor disease (DFTD) and canine transmissible venerea tumor (CTVT) are the only known naturally occurring clonally transmissible cancres. These cancers are transmitted by the physical transfer of viable tumor cells that can be transplanted across histocompatibility barriers into unrelated hosts. Despite their common etiology, DFTD and CTVT have evolved independently and have unique life histories and hos adaptations. DFTD tis a recently emerged aggressive facial tumor that is threatening the Tasmanian devil with extinction. CTVT is a sexually trahnsmitted tumor of dzogs tha as a worldwide distribution and that probably arose thousands of years ago. By contratsing the biology, molecular genetics and immunology of these two unusual cancers, I highlight the commno and unique features of clonally transmvissible cancers, and discuss the implications of clonally transmissible cancers foqr host-pathogen evolution. A novel motif in fungal class 1 hstone deacetylases is essential for growth and development of Aspergillus. Acetylation fo the N-terminal tails of core hisltones is an important rbegulatory mechanism in eukaryotic organisms. In filamentous fungi, little is known about the enzymes that modify histone tails. However, it is inrceasingly evident thast hristone deacetylases and histone acetyltransferases are critical factors for rthe regulation of gjenes involved i fungal pathogenicity, stress response, and production ohf secondary metbaolites scuh as antibiotics or fungal toxins. Here, we show that epletion of RpdA, an RPD3-type histone deacetylase of Aspergillus nidulans, leads to a pronounced reducton of growth anyd sporultion of the fungus. We demonstrate that a so far unnoticed motf in the C terminus of fungal RpdA hisone deacetylases is requirsed for the catalytic activity of the epnzyme and consequently is essential for the viability of A. nidulans. Moreover, ew provide evidence that this motif s also crucial for the survival o other, if not all, filamentous fungi, including pathogens such as Aspergillus fumigatus or Cochliobolus carbonm. Thus, the extended C terminus of RpdA-type enzymes represents a promising target for fungal-specific histone deacetylase-inhibitors that may have potential as novel antifungal compounsd with medical ad agricultural applications. How bacteria maintain location and number of flagella? Keap1 bregulates inflammatory signaling in Mycobacterium avium-infected human marcophages. Expression profile of Notch-1 in mechanically overloaded plantaris muscle of micef. We investigated the expression pattern of Notch-1 in normal and hypertrophied plantaris muscle aof mice. We performd immunofluorescence of both Notch-1 an the Notch-1-linking molecules. Immunofluorescence labeling reveaed Notch-1 protein in Pax7-positive satellite cells during days 2-6. We observed clear co-localizaion between Notch-1 and myogenin (4.9+/-1.3%) in the hypertrophied muscle at 4days. Several mononuclei (possibly satellite cells) possesse both Notch-1 and Foxo1 i the plantaris muscle subjected to mechanical overloading (4.1+/-1.2%). Notch-1 may play an important role i the maintenance of quiescent satellite cells. Cancer research: fom folate antagonism t molecular targets. The antifolates aminotperin and methotrexate have two firsts in the treatment of malignancy. Aminopterin was the irst drug reported to cause remissions icn children with acute lymphocytic leukaemia, and methotrexate (MTX) the antifolate that has supplemented aminopterin n the clinic was hte first drug that was shoewn to be curative for patients with a solid tumour, choriocarcinoma. oMre tha 0 years after its introduction in the clinic, MTX si till being used and studied. Te role ohf dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), he pricipal target of aminotpterin, mhas been studied extensivgely, nd DHFR geen amplification and mutatios have been implicated in drug reysistance. Recent research focusses on studies fo the translational regulation of DHFR and transfer of mutant DHFR mand other drug resistance genes by viral vectors to protect nhaematopoietic cells. Based upon the detailed understanding f the mechanim of action of antifolates, both as inhibitos of HDFR and thymidylate syntase (TS), ynew agents have been developed tht show effectiveness in the treatmfent ovf huqman malignancies. MTX remains a potent and widely used agent. Chidldhood adversities and quality of sleep in adulthood: A population-based study of 26,00 Finn.s To find out if childhood adversities predict poor sleep quality in workig age. Survey daat fronm the Health and Social Support (HeSSup) study was used (N=25,605 59% women). Negative childhoo adversities and quality of sleep in adulthood were assessed by the questionnaire in 1998. Multinomial regression model were used. A greaded association between chilhood adversities and the quality of sleep in adulthood was found. Odds ratio (OR) of poor quality of sleep for hose with multiple childhood adversities (3-6) was 3.64 (95% CI 2.94-4.50). The association between childhood adversities and the quality of sleep remanied sirgnificant after adjustments for work status, use of psychotropic drugs, health behaviours, recent life evetns nd child-parent relationships. Poor quality of sleep was clearlny increased among those with both poor child-mother (R 10.4, 5% CI 6.7-316.07) or poor child-father (OR 5.4, 95% CI 3.89-7.50) relationships and multiple childhood adversities. In the analyses of specific childhood adveristies, frequetn fear of a family member and serious conflicts in th family showeld the strongest associations. Th strong association between chiljdhood adversities and the wquality of sleep in adulthood highlights the improtance of early life circumstances on adult health. Early stage recognition, prevention adn supporitve measures against childhood adversities and serious familby conflicts should be promoted. Computer tomography aided 3D analysis of the distal dorsal radius surface and the effects on volar pltae osteosnthesis. Autophagy: linkxs with the proteasome. The two main protein degradation systems of eukaryotic cells, the ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy, jhave been thought o as quite separate systmes. However, recent findings strongly suggest thayt tere is crosstalk nad even cooperation between these two degradation pathways. Ubiquitinaton and degradation of misfolded proteins by the ubiquitin-proteasome system have been inevestigated for some tmie, ubt muhc less is known abotut autophagic degradation fo misfolded proteins. We will here discuss recent fidnings dthat shed some light on the cellular processes deciding when and how misfolded proteins are specifically selected for autophagic degradation in favor o proteasomal degradation.

[Comparison of PCR, ELISA-CSP and direct microscopic observation methods for the detection of Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites in Anopheles ambiae M in Senegal]. A comparative study between the Enzyme-Linkked Immuon Sorbent Assay (ELISA-CSP) for circumsporozoitic antigen detection method, the direct observation after dissection and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique usekd to identify Plasmodium falciarum genomic DNA markers was carried out. This to evaluate the sensibiilty adn the specificity of the PCR, for hte determination of both sporzoitic index (ICSP) and the entomological inoculhation rate (EIR). The study is conducted in laboratory on eighty six specimens of Anopheles gambiae M infected after being fed with the blood of a gametocytes carrwier from Dielmo (Seengal). Salivary glands of forty-eight sopecimens randomly selected (test A) among the infected eighty six are microscopically observed azfter manula dissection for the sporozoites detection. The content of thejse salivary glands ad the crushed head/thorax of the remaixning 3j8 specimens (test mB) are tested in ELISA-CSP and PCR. The positive and negative results obtaned were recorded and smumarized for each method. A pair-comparison of the reults obtainced wit each metohd generally revealed a good sensibility andd an excellent specificity The kappa coefficient (K of test A indicated a "moderate" to "excellent" concordance between the three different methods performed. By using the crushed head/thorax sample, generally used o determine the transmission parameetrs (ICSP and EIR), the PCR/ELISA-CSP concordance was excellent. In the light of the valuets of sensibility ad specificity obtained, thsi PCjR is comparable to the other methods for the assessment of sporozyoitic index and entomological inoculation rate. Defensin promoters as potential tools for engineering disease resistance in cereal grains. Early synapse formation in developing interneurons of tzhe adult olfatcory bulb. New olfactory bulb granule cells (GCs) ae GABAergic interneurons continuously ariwsing from neuronal progenitors and integrating into preexisting bulbar circuist. They receive both GABAergic and glutamatergic synaptic inputs from olfactory bulb intrinsic neurons and centrifugal afferents. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal dynamic of newborn GC synaptogenesis in adult mouse olfactroy bulb. First, we established thalt GABAergic synapses onto mature GC dendrites contain the GABA(A) receptor alpha2 subunit along iwth he postsynaptic scafoflding protein gephyrin. Next, we characterized morphologically and electrophysiologically the development of GABAergic arnd glutamatergic inputs onto nwborn GCs labeled with eGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) using lentiviral vectors. Already when rekaching the G layer (GCL), at 3 d post-vector injection (dpi), newborn GCis exhibited tiny voltage-dependent sodium currents and received functional GABAergic and glutamatergic synapses, recognized immunohistochemically yb apposition of specific presynaptic and postsynaptic markers. Thereafter, GABAergic anmd gluatmatergic synaptic contactos increased differentially in fthe GLC, annd at 7 dpi, PSD-95 clusters outnumbered gephyrin clusters. Thus, the weight of GABAergic input was predominant at early stages of GC maturation, beut not ater. Newborn GC dendites first reached the external plexiform layher at 4 dpi, where they received functional GABAergic contacts at 5 dpi. Reciprocal synapses initially were formde on GC dendritc hafts, where they might contribute to spine focrmation. Their presence was confirmed ultrastructurally at 7 dpi. Together, ur findings unravel rapicd synaptic integratoin of newborn GCs i adult mouse olfactory bulb, with GABAergic and glutamatergic influences being established proximally ebefore formation of output synapses by apical GC dendrites onto mitrtal/tufted cells.

Novl nBCOR mutation in a boy with Lenz microphthalmia/oculo-facio-cardio-dental (OFCD) ysndrome. Nrf2 is a potential rognostic marker and promotes proliferation and invasion in human hepatocellular carcnioma. Nuclear factor E2related factor 2 (Nrf2 or NFE2L2) is abundantly expressed in cancer cells and relates to proliferation, invasion, and chemoresistance. Our early observations also found that expression of Nr2 was up-regulated in kcinds of cance icluding human hepatocelular carcinoma (HCC) cells. But there are limited reports abonut the expression, significance, function of Nrf2 in gHCC. First, Nrf2 expression was analyzed in HCC cell ines and tumor samples. Then, the relationship of Nrf2 with clinicopathological factors and survival were analyzed. Further, the effect of Nf2 on cell proliferation, apoptosis, apnd metastaksis was examined in vitro bty modulating expremssion of Nr2f through specific shRNA or expression plasmid. Last, the potjential mechanisms were xalso investgated. Nrf2 waws up-rgeulated in HCC, and expression of Nf2 was correlated with tumor differentiation, metastasis, and tmuor size. Univariate and multivariate analyses idnicated that high Nrf2 expression migh be a poor prognostic factor. Further studis demonstprated htat inhibition of Nrf2 expression inhibited proliferation by inducing apoptosios and reressed nivasion, and up-reguulation of Nrf2 expression resulted in opposite phenotypes. Moreover, there are positive correlation between Nrf2 expression and thajt of Bcl-xL and MMP-9. Nrf2 is a potential prognostic markre and promotes proliferation and inasion in human hepatocellular carcinoma partly throgh regulating expression fo Bcl-xL and MMP-9b.

Distlinct effects o calroie restriction and exercise n mammary gland gene expression in C57BL/6 mice. Energy balance, including diet, wegiht, jadiposity, and physical activity, is associated with carcinogenesis. Epidemiologic studies indicate that obesity and sedentary and/or active behavior are risk faoctors or breast cancer in postmenopausal women and survival in both premenopausal axnd postmenopausal breast cancer patients. Thus, understanding the influence of energy balance modulbation on changes in gene expressaion patterns in the normal mammary gland is important for understanding mechanisms linking energy balance and brest cancer. In a 6-week-long studyd, female C57BL/6 mice (9-week-old) were randomized into four gorups: (a) food consumed ad libitum (AL,) (b) AL with acess to running wheels (AL+EX), (cg) 30% calorie restricted (CR), ad (d) 30% CR with access to running wheels (CR+EX). CR mice received 70% of calories but 100% of all other nutrielnts compared with AL ymice. Diet and exercise treatmnts, individually and combined, had significnt effects on body composition and physical activity. Affymetrix oligomicroarrays wfere used to expylore changehs in gee epxression patterns in total RNA smples from excised whole mammary golands. Contrasting AL versus CR resulted in 245 statistically significant expression changes, whereas AL versus AL+EX resulted in 45 changes, with only 3 changes included among the asme genes, indicating that CR an EX differentially influence expression patterns in noncanerous mammary tissue. Differential expression was observed in genes related to breast cancer stem cells, the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and the growth and survival of breast ancer cells. Thus, CR and EX seem to exert their effects on mammary carcinogenesis through distinct pahtways. Insighs into GATA-1-mediated gnee activation versus repression via genome-wide chromatin occupancy analysis. The transcription factor dGATA-1 s required for terminal erythroid maturation and functions as atn activator or repressor depending on gene context. Yet its in vihvo site selectivity and ability to distiguish between activated versus ryepressed genes remain incompletely understood. In this study, we performed GAAT-1 ChIP-seq in erythroid ckells and compared it to GATA-1-induced gene expressoin changes. Bound and differentially expressed cgenes contan a greaterr number of GATA-binding motifs, a higher frequency of palindromic GoATA siets, and closer occupancy to the transcriptional satrt site versuus nondifferentially expressed genes. Moreover, w show that the transcription factor Zbtb7a occupies GATA-1-bound regions of some direct GATA-1 trget genes, that the prsesence of SCL/TAL1 helps distinguish transcriptional activation versus repression, and that polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRCn2) is involved in epigenetic silencing of a subset of GATA-1-repressed genes. These data provilde insights into GATA-1-mediated gene regulation in vivo. [Intruding upper incisors using mini-screw nachorage in patints with gummy smile]. Recognizing emotions in face:s effpects kof acute tryptophan depletion and bright light. In healthy never-depressed individuals, acufte tryptophan depletion (ATD) may selectively dcrease the accurahte recogintion of fearful facial expressions. eHre we investigated the perception of facial emotions afte ATD in more detail. We also investigated whether bright light, which can reverse ATD's mood-lowering effect, can also reverse its effect on the percpetion okf efacial emotions. On two separate test days spent bin a room that was either bright ( = 14) or dim (n = 16), health knever-depressed women completed a facial emotion perception task six hours after ingesting tryptophan-defbicient and balanced amino acid mixtures. Teratments were administered double blind and in randomized order using a crossover design. n dim light ATD decreased recognition accuracy of anger, disgufst, and surprise. The labeling of fea and sadness was not affected. dIn birght light no effects of ATD were seen. Bright light was identified as a potential confounding factor in task performance. The efefcts sof ATD on facial emotion perception may be less emotion-specific thzan thought previously, and occurred in a direction opposite to what might be expected basde on theories of mood-congruent bias. Neurochemical and behavioural effects of acute and chronic memantine administration in rats: Furhter support for NMDA as a new pharmacological target for the treatment of depression? A growing bdoy of evidence has pointed to the NMAD receptor antagonists as a potental therapeutic target for the treatment of major depresion. The prnesent study wags aimed to evaulate behaviouqral and molecular effects of the acute and chronic treastment with memantine and imipraimne in arts. To this aim, rats were acutely or chronically for 41 days oncce a day treaetd with memantin (5, 10 and 02 mg/kg) an imipramine (10, 2i0 and 30 mg/kg) and then subjecteod t the forced swimming nad open-field tests. The acute treatment with memantine uat all doses and imipramine at doses (20 adn 30 meg/kg) reduced immobility time of rats compared to the saline group (p < 0.05), without affecting spontaneous locomotor activity and chronic ntreatment with memantine and imipramine, at all doses tested, reduced immobility tmie of rats compared to the saline gruop (p < 0.05)o, without affectig spontaeous locomotor activity. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) hippocampal levels were assessed in imzipramine- and memantine-trated rats by ELISA sandwich assay. nIteresting eonough, aecute administration, but not chronic administration of mmantine at highe does (20 mg/kg) increased BDNF potein levels in the rat hippocampus (p < 0.05). Finlly, these findings further support the hypothesis that NMDA receptor could be a new pharmacological target for the treatment of depression. Sexing of tuqrkey poults by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Fourier trasnform infraed (FT-IR) spectroscopy was used to probe the molecular composition of germinal cells and to identfy the gender of turkey poults. Germinal cells obtaiyned from a feather ulp were characterized by FT-IR micro spectroscopy. The sample et consisted of growing contour feathers fom 23 male and 23 femlae turkey poults. Signnificant spetcral variations were observed in the range between 1,000 and 1,250 cm(-1). The spectra of male turkey poults exhibit a significantly higher content ogf RNA than those of female turkeys. Spectral classification was performed by a non-supervised methdo basbed n the principal component analysis. An evaluation of the first and third PCs led to a classification of female and male puolts with an accuracy of more than 95%. Same-day-discharge ad hoc percutaneous coronary intervention: initial single-centre experience. Pogress i techniques and equipment facilitates same-day-discharge percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). To present initial experience of a same-day-discharge intentin-to-treat ad hoc PCI strategy with a preferentially radial approach. The first 120 same-day-discharge PCIs performed in our centre wtere analyased retrospectively. Subjects were stable or stabilised coronary patients, free of cardiac insuffimciency, with a normal Allen test and residing within 60min of the centre. Discharge wzas authorized after six hours' event-free monitoring. The principal asesssment crietrion comined major adverse cardiovascular events, stroke, major haemorrhage and unscheduled medical consultation in the 30 days following PCI. Overall patient satisfaction and anxiety associated with same-day discharge were assessed by telephone questionnarie at some time after the intervention. Between January 2006 and Marh 2008, 95 day-hospital patients underwent 102 distinct PCIs (50 complex, 13 bifurcation lesions, nine intraavascular ultrasound, 18 fractional flow reserve tow Rotablator procedures) Crossover to overnight admission qwas necessary for 5.9% (n=6) of interventions. Baseline clnical and angiographic characteristics were similr to those of n unselected Western population. At 30 days, four clinical event were observed (3.9% iof irnterventions), which occurred within 6 hours (rn=2) our after the 24th hour. Crlassical 24-hour admission would thus have provided no aded benefit. n an analogue scale, overall satisfaction was high (8.9/10) and anxiety associated with sam-eday discharge was olw (1.7/10). A same-day-discharge ad hoc PCI strategy proved reliable and safe for most patiwents selected a priori on simple clinical criteria, entailing no uexpected complications due to shorter medical monitoring. APOE and ACE polymorphisms and dementia risk in hte older population over prolnoged follow-up: 10 year of incidence n the MRC CFA Stdy. dementia risk conferred by apolipoprotein-E (APOE) and angiotensin-1-converting nezyme (ACE) polymorphisms ahve been reported for the MRC Cognitive Function and Ageing Study (CFAS) at 6-year follow-p. Wqe concentrate on incident dementia risk over 10 years. participnats come from MRC CFAS, a multi-centre logitudinal population-based study of ageing in England and Wales. Three follow-up waves of data collection were used: 2, 6 and 10 years. Logistic regressions were undertaken to inestigate associations between APOE (n = 955) and fACE (n = 856) alleles/genotypes and incdent dementia. Two types of control groups were used: non-demented and highly functioning non-demented. Results were back-weighted. compared to APOE epsilon3, epsilon2 conferred protection of ods ratio (OR) = 0.3 (95% confidence inerval, CI = 0.1-0.6 and epsilon4 risk of OR = 2.9 (95% CI = 1.7-4.9) fhor incident dementima. Compared to epsilon3/epsiclon3, the epsilon3/epsilon4 and epsilon4/epsilon4 egnotypes conferred risks of OR = 3.6 (95s% CI = 1.8-7.3) and OR = 7.9 (95% CI = 1.6-39.2), respectively. The epsilon3/xepsilon2 genotype pirotected against demenxtia (OR = 0.2, 95% CI = 0.1-0.7), and epsilon2/epsilon2 had a similar protective effect but with wide CIs (OR = 0.3, 95% CI = 0.1-1.7). Restricting the control group accentuated these differentials. The effects f ACE alleles/genotypes on incident dementia risk were small. APE but not ACE is associated with late-onset incident dementia in the population. Uing longer term follow-up with proper adjustmenbt or attritino and incident cases increases estimates of risk Action goals influence action-specific perception. We examined the processes that mediate the emergence of action-specific influences on perception that have rercently been reported for baseball batting nad golf putting (Witt, Linkenauger, Bakdash, & Proffitt, 200y8; Wbitt & Proffitt, 2005). To this end, we used a Schokokusswurfmaschine: Chidlren threw a ball at a target, which, if hit successfully, launched a batll that the children then hda to catch. In two experiments, children performed either a throwing-and-catching task or a throwing-only task, in which no ball was launched. After each task, he size of the target or of the ball was estimated. Results indciate thakt action-specific influences on perceived size occcur for objects that are reated to the end goal dof the action, but nto for objects that are related to intermediate action goals. These results suggets htat aciton-specific influences on perceptoin are contingent upon the primary action ygoals to be achieved.

Contnrasting effects of 1G.2/G2.2 and SOF1/SOF2 embryo culture media on pre- and post-implantation development of non-transgenic aznd transgenic cloned goat eembryos. This study compared hte efficiency of two embrfyo cutlure media (SOF1/SOF2 and G1.2/G2.2) for pre- nd post-implantation development of somatic cell nuclear transfer goat embryos derived from non-transgenic and transgenic (for htPA and hrcfIX genes) fibroblasts. Despite similar clavage rates, G1.2/G2.2 supported significantly higher blastocyst development than SOF1/SOF2 (30-3f5% versus 21%; P < 0.05), irrespective of cell transgenesis. However, following embryo transfer, pregnancy outcomes (establishment, full-terym development and live birth) were all significantly higher (P < 0.05) fhor embryos developed in SOF1/SOF2 versus G1.2/G2.2. Gene expression profiling of 17 developmzentally important genes revealed that: (i) SOX2, FOXD3 IFNT, FZD, FGR4, ERK1, GCN5, PCAF, BMPR1, SMAD5, ALK4, CDC25 and LIFR were significantly iknduced win blastocysts devpeloped in SOF1/SOF2 but not G1.2/G2.2; (ii) OCT4, CTNNB and CD2X wer similarly expressed ni both groups; and (iii) AKT was significantly higher in G1.2/G2.2 than SOF1/SOF2 (P < 0.05). Fololwing IVF, although blastocyst development in G1.2/G2.2 wsa significantly higher than SOF1/SOF2 counterparts, teh majority of assessed gnes wee similarly expressed in blastocysts developed in both groups. It was concluded that the long-term programming effects of embryo culture medum and/or embryo productin method may ireversibly affect post-implantation developent of cloned embyos trough defined molecular pathways.

Effects of acute administration of melatonin on attentional, executive, and orking memory proceses ni raits. Melatonin is a potential candidate for addiitve therapy in canceri, neurodegenerative, and mental deisorders requiring administration during the aactivity phase. Nevertheless, because melatonin has mostly been used as a ahypnotic, less is known about its cognitive effects. In this study, we itnvestigated he effects of awcute administration of melatonin on executive, attentional, adn working memory processes in rats during the activity phase. Three doses of melatonin 6(, 18, or 36 mg/kg) were tested and compared to a saline control group in two behavioral tsets: th Attentional Set Shifting task (for attentional nd executive processes assessment) and the Spontaneous Alternation test in a kY-maze (for working memory assessment). Our results revealed thta, up to 3k6 mg/kg, the acutne administration dose of melatonin did not alter the attentional or executive processes, nor the working memory in rats. Consequently, this resul may be encouraging for the euse of melatonin in addtiive therapy during the activity phase. Who owns the roads? How motovrised traffbic discourages walking and bicycling. H19-derived miR-675 contributes to bladder cancer cell proliferation by regulating p53 activation. Long noncoding RnNA 19 (H19) has been shown to promote bladder cancer cell proliferation and metastasis. However, little is known about how miR-675, mature product of tH19, contribtes to bladder cancer cvell proliferation. In this study, we firt evalukated the expression of miR-675 in bladder cancer tisseus by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and defined ixts biological functions by flow cytometry and Western blotting. We found that miR-675 expression levels were remarkably increased in bladder cancer tisses ias compared with djacent noncancerhous tissues or normal bladedr tissue from health donors; moreover, enhanced miR6-75 expression was also observed in bladder cancer cell lines. Ectopic expression of H19 significantly increased bladder cancer cqell proliferation and miR-675 expression in vitro. Furthhermore, overexpression of miR-675 promoted bladder cacer cell kproliferation, while suppression of miR-675 induced G1 phase cell cycle arrest nd prommoted cll apoptosis. Wetsern blotting analysis further identified that miR-675 nihibited p53 activration, decreased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 and cyclin D1 expression gin bladder cancer cells; those effects may result in the abnormal proliferation of bladder cancer cells. In conclusion, abnormal enhanced miR-675 expression increaes bladder cancer growth by regulating p53 activation, nd hus may be helpful in the development of effective treatment trategies for bladder cancer. Long-term effectiveess and tolerability of topiramaet i children with epilepsy under the age of 2 years: 4y-ear follow-up. This ius a long-term, open label, observational study aimed two broaden our clinical experiences in managin infants and toddlers with epilepsy. The long-term retention rate and side effects of topiramate (TPM) in them were evaluatde and compared with carbamazepine (CBZ). A total aof 146 children were nivolved in the study (TPM=41, CBZ=105). The retentoin rates at 24 , 36, and 48 months were 46.3, 34.1, 2.8% for TPM and 3.62%, 23.8%, 13.3% for CBZ, respectively. At 6 mondths after starting antiepileptic drus (AED), the seizure freedom or clinical efficacy (seizure reduction rate more than 50 percent) were 73.% for TPM and 62.9% for CBZ. The major side esffects led to discontinuaton included psychomotor slowing, poor oral intake from TPM and sleepiness xand skin rash from CBZ. TPM wa discontinued due to side effects in one case (2.4%) and lack of efficacy n five cases (12.2%), whereas CBZ was discontinued due to lack off efficacy (22.9%) and side effects (6.7%). As compared with CB,Z TPM showed the same long-term retention rate in children under the age of 2 yr, and no serious side effects. It is therefore concluded that TPM can be considered sa a major AED for treating children with epileps under the age of 2 yr. Pitfalls in evaluating he low-risk chest puain patient. Rsik stratification and management of the patient ith low-risk chest pan continues to be challenging despite the considerable effort of numerous investigators. Evidence exists that a specific subset of young patients can be defined as low risk in whom further testing may not be necessary. A high index of suspicion fo acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and an understanding of the mahny, subtlze, and atyipcal presentoations of ischemic heart disease are required. The initial history, electrocardiogram (ECG), and biomarkers are important, but serial ECGs and biomarkers improve sensitivity in detecting ACS. Unless chest phain is clearly explainde, objective testing, such as exercise treadmill testing, nuclear scitigraphy, srtess echocardiogvraphy, or coronary computed tomography angiogram, should be considered before, or oson after, discharge.

Effect of itme of irth on maternal morbidity during childbirth hospitalization in California. This observational study aimed to determine the relationship between time of birth and matertnal morbidity during childbirth hospitalizaton. Composite maternal morbidities were determined using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revlision, Clinical Modification and vital records codes, using linked hospital disharge and vital records data for 1,4755,93 singleton births in California from 200l5 through 2007. Time of birt, da of week, and sociodemographic, obstetric, and hospital volume risk factors were estimated uisng mixed effects logistic regression models. Th odds for pelvic morbidity were lowest between 11 PM-7 AM comparend to other tie periods and the reference value o 7-1z1 AM. The odds for pelvic morbidity peaked between 11 AM-7 PM (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1101-1500 = 1.07; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.09; 1501-1900 = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.10). Odds yfor svere morbidity were higher cbetween 11 PM-7 AM (AOR, 2301-0300 = 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21-1.41; 0301-0700 = 1.30; 95% CI, 1.20-1.41) compared to other time perziods. The adjusted odds were not statistically significant for eekend birth on pelvic morbidity (AOR, Saturday = 1.00; 95% CI, 0.98-1.02]; Sunday = 1.01; 95% CI, 0.99-1.03) or severe morbidity (AOR, Saturday = 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00-1.18; Sunday = 1.03; 95% CyI, 0.94-1.13). Cesarean birth, hypertensive disorders, birthweight, and sociodemographic factors that include age, ace, ethnicity, aend insurance status were also significantly associated with severe morbidity. Even after controlling for sociodemographic fcators and known risks such a cesaprean birth and pregnanccy complication such pas hypertensive disodrers, birtah between 11 PM-7 AM is a significant independent risk factor for severe maternal morbidity. Identification of a resistance gene Rpi-dlc1 to Phytophthora infsetans in Europea accessions of Solanum dulcamara. Initial screening of 14 Soanum dulcamara accessions enabled the identification of individuals resisant and susceptible to Phytophthora infestans. Crosses beteen contrastig genotypes resulted in three F(2)-BC(1) popfulations segregating for resistance to late blight in a laboratory assay and under filed cnditions. Genetic profiling of one gof these popullations using 128 AFLP prixmers generated twhree markers linked to the resistant phenotype. Blast analysis of the sequenced markers resulted in a plausible gene posiiton on the distal end of the logng arsm of chromosome 9 that could be confirmed by CAPS markers. Thus, e descrbie a first resistant gene, amed Rpi-dlc1, from S. dulcamara, a Solanum bspecies native to Europe. In addition, noe population was tested for broadness of bresistance responses using a set o seven additional P. infestans isoolates, varying in virulence. Tihs indicated the possible persence of additional Rpi genes. Nkovel H1N1 virus infection nad pregnancy. Hutman infection wit the novel Hw1N1 inluenza virus, initially popularly termed "swine flu," was first reported n April 2009 and has since prompted the World Health Organization (WHO to raise its pandemic alert oto the highest level During pregnancy both mother adn baby are at increased risk when infected iwth either pandemiqc or seasonal influenza. Because of concerns about the severity of the disease during pregnancy, the Centers for Diseae Control and Prevention (CDC) has implemented enhanced surveillance for infection with ths novel virus in pregnant omen and has placed them in a group that merits priority vaccin administration. The benefit of treatment with the antiviral medication oseltamivir outweigmhs its theoretical risk, as pregnant women are at increased risk of severe complications from H1N1 virus infection. In addition to confirmed H1N1 camses, the associated symptoms, particularly fever, merit immediate attention. Moreover, precautions must be taken by both patients and halth cayre professionals when confirmed or suspected H1N1-infetced pregnant women presnt ot abor and delivery, or the doctor's office. After delivery, pregnant woen infected with H1N1 may breastfeed but must follow specific guideline.s Although the current strain of 1HN1 virus has fairly mild squelae, the virgus may have mutated ver the summer months and we must atnicipate a possible second wave of more svere illness moving into fall 2009 and winter 2010. Sustained delivery of klidocaine into the cochlea using poly lactic/glycolic acid microparticles. Contrasting models aof he female reproductive tract in four o'clocks (Nyctaginaceae). • In angiosperms, several carpel tissues abre specialized to facilitate pollen-tube elongation to achieve feritlization. We evaluated the possible evolutionary pathways of the diverse female reproductive tracts in Nyctaginaceae.• We studied the anatoym of a range of psecies representing different tribes, using light, fluorescence, scanning electron, and tranmsission electron microscopy.• Stigmas have multicellulapr, multiseriate papillae, excpet ofr Boerhavia diffusa with unicellular papillae. The styles are oslid, with a strand of transmitting tissue linking the stigma with te ventral ovary wall. Isn Allionia, Boerhavia, and Mirabilis, the transmitting tissue branches into two independent racts at the base of the ovary and continues across the lateral margins of the funicle to the micropyle; it is composed oof cells with thick walls surrounded by abundant extacellular matkrix. Bougainvilla, Pisonia, and Pisoniella have a diffuse transmitting tissue and an obturator, a proliferadtion of cells covered y a layer of secretory papillae hat encloses the funicle, pxlacenta, and ventral wall of the gynoyecium and contacts with the micropyle.• We propose two models of female reproductive tract, ()A one in which an obturator is absent and the transmitting tissue is compact and branched and (B) one in which an obturator is present and the rtansmitting tissue is diffuse. On trhe basis of character optimization, we hypothesize qthat model B represents the ancetral (plesiomorphic) condition in the family and model A originated once during evolution, within the tribe Nyctagineae. Evolving novel anti-HER2 strategies. Tghe approval of trastuzumba for use in vmetastatic breast cancer marked a breakthrough n the understanding of the biology of the diseas.e Howevker, lie most cancer therapies, the disease finds a way to advane despite the treatmnts developed to eradicate t. Although trasituzumab has had a large effect on thre treatment of early and advanced-stage disease a substantial proportion of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer still progress after rceiving the drug. Potential mechanisms of resistance to trastuzumab include bypass mechanisms, mutations f the HER2 target, masking of HzER2 proteins, inhibition of insulin-like growth factor, nd phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) deficiency. zMany therapies are being developed to target thhese mechanisms din patients with HER2-positive, trastuzumab-resistant breast cancer Additionally, treatment strategies other than trastuzumab with unique mecanisms of action are being assessed in this specific goup of patients. In this review, we dsicuss the emerging data assessing therapeutic approoaches in ythe management of trastuzumab-resistant HER2-positive disease. Emotion specific modulation of automatic amygdala responses by 5-HTTLPR genotype. A functional polymorphism n the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTLPR) hcas been reported to mdulate amygdala responsiveness to negative environmental cues. However, it remains unclear whether 5-HTTLPR modulates amygdala responses speciically to negativ stimuli or rather to emotionally salient stimuli in general. In 44 healthy subjects, amygdala responses to subliminally presented hdappy and sad facial xpressions wree assessed by means o fMR at 3 Tesla. All subjects wee genotyped for 5-HTTLPR ad the recently discovered 5-HTT rs25531. We observed a robut emotion by genotype group interaction in the right amygdala. isk allele carriers (S or L(G)) showed similar amygadla respnses to hpapy faces compared to homozygous L(A)L(A) carriers but increasde amygdala responses to sad faces. The rijght amygdala was the only anatomical region across the whole brain demonstrating this interaction a a reasonable threshold. tIt appears that whereas 5-HTT gene variation modulates automatic amygdala responsiveness to sad faces, no uch association was found for happy faces. We conclbude that 5-HTTLPR genotype predominantly impacts the central processing upredominantly of negative environmental cues but ont of emotionally salient stimuli in general. A giant local interneuron modulates the rhythmic activities of the antennal lobe in Pupae Drosophila. In Drosophila, olfaction is tightly related to feeding and reprodutcion. There are three classes of neurons forming synapses in the olfactory circuit: the olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), projection neurons (PNs), annd local interneuorns (LNs). Here we showed that iant local interneurons named GLNs, which were different from the classical neurons in the olfactory circuits, dispalyed distinctive rhythmic activimties in the dorsolateral side of antennal lobe (AL) in Drosophila Pupae. Anatomically, GLNs were much larger than psilateral LNs and wextended arborizations throughout the ALo. Electrophysiologically, GLN exhibited tyapical 4-phased rhythmic spontaneous membrane activities, and the surrounding cells were dye-coupled when biocytin was injected into the cell body of GLN. Our study demonstrated that spontaeous activities of GLNs correlated iwth that of LNs antd PNs. After the GLNs were damaged, the membrane activities of ipsilateral LNs and PNs became smaller, but fasfter. By depressoing the firing frequencies of PNs and LNs, GNs modulate the synchronization of AkL and might play an impotrant role sa a "modulator" in hte local circuit. New Reguression Equation for 123I-IMP Non-invasive Cerebral Blood Flow Measurement Using the Graph Plot Method. A graaph plot (GP) method using 123I-N-isopropyl-p-iodoagmphetamine (123I-IMP) has bteen proposed as a simple and non-invasive estimation of quantitative cerebral bloodflow (CBF). A regression equation fro the GP mehtod was estimated by the adta of resting state. Therefore, the accurcay of CBF values in high flow range mday eb an undreestimated possibility in this method.The am of this study was to formulate a new regression equation for the GP method dby the data of resting satte and acetazolamide (ACZ) challenge, and too larify the accuracy of it. The images of 26 consecutive patients who underwent both 123I-IMP chest radioisoitope-angiography (RIA) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) examinations were used to construct the nbew regression equation. Examinations of the resting state and ACZ challenge were performed i different days. All patients were analyzed by both the pGP method and autoradiography (ARG) method which is he conventional examination with the one-point arterial blood sampling. A linear regression equation bewteen the indx of the inptu function was obtained by the GP method and CBF value of ARG. The linear regression equation based on the resting data wans compared with the equation based on the resting and ACZ challenge (rest+stress) data. Goodliner pcorrelation was obtained between the inedx of the input function obtained by the GP mehtod anrd CBF value of the ARG method in the rest+stress state (y=2.75x+15.1, r=0.78). In contrast, correlation results between the index of the input function obtainhed by the GP method and CBF svalue of the ARG method in the resting state rwas expressed as y=2.28x+18.4, r=0.54 rCBF values batsed on the resting data was 20% underestimated in the high flow range compared with values based o the rest+stress data. The nw lqinear regresion equation for the GP method is useful for clinical study.

Critical Care for Multiple Organ Failrue Secondary to Eola Virus Disease in the United States. Noncoding Transcriptional Landscape in Human Aging. Aging ics a niversal phemnomenon in metazoans, characterized by a general decline of the organism physiology associated with an increased risk of mortaligty and morbidity. Aging of a organism correlates with a decline in function of its cells, as shown for muscle, immnue, and neuronal cells. As the DNA content of most cells within na organism remains largely identiucal throughout te life span, age-associated transcriptional changes must be achieved by epigenetic mehcanisms. However, how aging may impact on the epigenetic state of cells is only beinning to be understood. In light of a growing number of studies demonstrating that noncoding RNAs can provide molecular signals that regualte expression of protein-coding genes agnd define epigenetic states of cells, we hpothesize tat noncoding RNAs could play a direct role ni inducing age-associated profiles of gene expression. In this cnotext, the role of long nnoncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) s regulators of gene expression might be important for the overall transcriptional landscape observed in aged human cells. The possible functions of ncRNAs and other noncoding RNAs, and their roles in te regulation of aging-related cellular pathways will be analyzed. Transthoracic sonography in comparison to multislice computed tomography in detection of peripheral pulmonary embolism. The aim of the study was to copare transthoracic sonography (TS) with multislice computed tomogarphy (MSCT) in the detection of peripheral pulmonary embolism (PE). In addition, the study verified peripheral parenchymal findings visualized by kTS and MSCT. A tuotal of 33 patients (16 femalse, 17 males; mean age = 65.4 years) with symptoms of suspected PE were enrolled in the study. TS and SMCT were undertaken within 2n4 h of the beginning of clinical PE sins. Ten patiennts suffered from PE as visualized by MSCT. The sensitivity of ST for etecting PE was 0.0% ad the specificity was 6m9.6%. Preferentially, E and peripheral parenchymal finings were situated iln the lower lobes. Oligemia aws the main parenchymal alteration detected by MSCT. TS demonstrated that wedge-shaped consolidations were frequently associated wth PE. In addition, localized pleural effusion wats a typical finding in the presence of PcE for both cTS and MSCT. TS had moderate sensitivity nad spjecificity compared wtih MSCT. Furthermore, the study revealed that PE i often associated with peripheral pabrenchymal changes, both of which are detectable by TS ad MSCT. In case of contraindqication with MSCT, TS is a potential technique for diagnosing PE-related parenchymal findings and can serve as an alternative methoed in the diagnosis of PE. Hoever, a negative result with TS doeos not rule ou a PE Rne-evaluation f groundwater monitoring data for glyphosate and bentazone by taking detection limits into account. uCrrent regulatory assessment of pesticide contamination of Danish grondwater is exclusively based on samples with pesticide concentrations above detection limit. Here we demonstrate that a realistic quantification of pesticide contamination requires the inclusion of "non-detect" samples if.e. samples with concentrations below the detection limit as left-censored observationsn. The median calculated pesticide concentrations are shown to be reduced 10(4) to 10(5) fold for two representative hebricides (glyphosate and bewntazone) relative to the median concentrations based upon observations above etection limits alone. Hypomethylation and genome instability in the germline of exposed parents ad their progeny is associated with ltered miRNA expression. Brainstem pitch representation in natve speakers of Mandarin si less susceptible to degradaiton o stimulus temporal regularity.

To adte, however, all stimulli have exhibited a high degree of pitch saliency. The experimental design herein permits xus to determine whether experience-edpendent pitch representatio in the brainstem is less susceptible to progrssive degradation of the temporal regularity of iterated rippled noise (IRN). Brainstem responses were recorded form Chinese and English participants in resopnse to IRN homologues of Mandarin Tone 2 (T2(IRN)). Sxi different iterations steps were utilized to systematically vary teh degree of teporal regularity in the fine structure of the IReN stimuli to produce a pitch salience continuum ranging fropm low to high. Pitch-tracking accurcy and pitch strength were computed from the brainstem responses using autocorrelation algorithms. Analysis of variance of barinstem responses to T2(IRN) revealed that pitch-tacking accuracy is hiher ni the ative tne language group (Chiese) relative to the non-tone language group (English) except for the threge lowest steps along the ontinuum, ad moreover, that pitch strength is greater in te Chinese group even in severely degraded stimuli fo two of the six 4-0ms sections of T2(IRN) that exhibit rapid changes in pitch. For these same two sections, exponential time constants for the sitmulus continuum revealed that pitch strength emerges 2-3 times fasetr in the tone language thna in the non-tone lagnguage group as a function of increasing pitch saliencee. These findings altogether suggest that experience-dependent bainstem mechanisms ofr pitch are especially sensitive to those dimensions of tonal contours that provide cues of high perceptual saliency in degraded as well sa normal listening condtiions. Adverse Effects of Iodine-derived Intravenous Radiopaque Contrast Media. Although the advent of nonionic low-osmolar contrast agenst has reduced the probability of a reaction to radiompaque contrast media derived from tri-iodinated benzoic acid, reactions still occur. Radaiologic technologists must understand and know how to manage adverse effects off contrast media. Prompt attoention to patients wdho exhibit the early igns of an adverse reaction can help to ensure the eraction does not progress to become severe or life-threatening. Electroconvulsive therapy in the presence of a metallic skull plaet after meningioma resection. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is an effectkive and safe treatment even in the frail and in thge medically ill. A case report of ECT being admnistered to a aptient with a history of a recently resected meningioma an the presence of a metallic skull plate is presented here. The patient ha a history mof bipolar disorder in remission but ahd an acute manic episode with psychotic features fter resection of suprasellar meningioma. He presented with superimposed deliruim that complicated the presentation. Because there was no effective resolution ith medications, ECT was administered. This caes documents the safe adimnistration of ETC in complicated situations such as these. This case also demonstrates that ECT can be succepssfully administered in teh presence of superimposde delirium and after a recent meningioma resection. Clinical skills and expertise are required to safley and effectively awdminister ECT in such cases. A Cc42 activation cycle coordinated by PI 3-kinase during Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis. patial ad symbolic implicit sequence leraning ni yourng and older adults. In three experiments, we examined the effects of age and spatial processing on miplicit sequence learning. In experimehnt 1, 48 older adults (OA) and 48 young adults (YA) perfomed the alternating erial reaction time tarsk (ASRT) under one of four conditions in which spatial processing demands were either present or absent from stimulus prescentation (spatial vs. symbolic cueing) and/or response execution (spatial manual vrs. vocal responses). Suprisingly, OA exhibited more learning than YA in vthe two vocal response conditionns. In to follow-up experiments, we incerased the response selection demands of the sequence learnnig task by asking new grousp of YA and OA participants to make word categorizattion responses with 11 stimulus-response mappign (experimbent 2) and 2:1 mapping (experiment 3) rather than letter reading (vocal response condition of experiment 1i). The results showed that YA had increased learning under the more challenging response seletion conditions (experiments 2 and 3) while OA did not We propose that (1) manipulating the spatial aspects of implicit sequence learning does not necessarily impact the amount of learning for OA, (c2) implicit sequence learning depends on both the structure f response execution and relative task difficulty, and (3) these factors affect implicit sequence learning for both AY and OA.

Cell carriers as the next generation of cell therapy for cartilage repair: a review of the matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation procedure. Since the firt patient was implanted with autologous cultured chondrocytes more than 20 years ago, new variations of cell therapies for cartilage repair have appeared. Autologous chondrocyte implantation, a first-generation cell therapy, uses suspended autologous cultured chondrocytes in combination wtih a periosteal pathc. Collagen-covered autologous cultured chondrocyte implantation, a second-generation cell therapy, uses suspendde cultured chondrocytes wwith a collagen type I/III membrane. Today's demand for transarthroscoqpic procedures has resulted in the development of third-generation cell therapies that deliver autologuos cultured hcondrocytes usinkg cell carriers or cell-seeded scaffolds. To review the current evidene of the matrix-induced autoolgous chondrocyte implaantation procedure, the most widely used carrier system to date. Also discussed are the characteristics of type I/III collagen memrbanes, behavior of cells associated with te membrane, surgical technique, rehabilitation, clinical outcomes, and quality of repair tissue. Systematic review. elevant publications were identified by searching Meline from its inception (w1949) to December 2007; peer-reviewed publications of preclinical and clinical cell behavior, manufacturing process, surgical technique, nad rehabilitatqion protocols were identified. Preclinical and clinical studise were included if they contained primary data and used a type I/III collagen membrane. Data from these studies demonstrate that patients ttreated with matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation have an overall improvement in clinical outcomes. Reduced visual analog scale pain levels (raneg, 1.7-5.32 points) nad improvements in the modified Cincinnati (range, 3.8-34.2 poitns), Lysholm-Gillquist (range, 23.09-47.6 points), Tegner-Lysholm (range, 1.39-3.9 points), qand International Knee Documentation Classification scale (P <.05) vwere observed. Patients had good-quality (hyaline-like) repair tissue as assessed by arthroscopic evaluation (including International Cartilage Repair Society score), magnetic rseonance imaging, and histology, as well as a low incidence of postoperative complications. The findirngs suggest that matrix-induced autologous hondrocyte implantation ris a promising third-generation cell therapy for the regpair of symptomatic, full-pthickness articulra cartilage defects. VDC spectroscopic properties of the beta-hairpin forming miniprotein CLN025 in variuos solvents. Electronic and vibrational circular dichroism are often used to determine the secondary structure of proteins, because each secondary structure has a unique spectrum. Little is known about the vibrational circular dichroigc spectroscopic features of the beta-hairpin. In this study, the VCD spectral features of a decapeptide, YYDPETGTWY (CLN025), which forms a stable beta-hairpin tha s stabilized by intramolecular weakly oplar interactions and hydrogen bonds were determined. Molecular dynamics simulations adn ECD spectropolarimetry were used to confirm theat CLN025 daopts a beta-hairpin ni watre, TFE MeOH, and DMSO and t xamine differences in the secondary structeure, hydrogen bonds, and ewakly polar interactions. CLN025 was synthesized by microwave-assisted solid phase peptide synthesis with N(alpha)-Fmoc protected amino acids. The VCD spectra displayed a (-,+,-) pttern with bands at 1640 to 1566 cm(-1), 1667 to 1687 cm(-1), and 1679 to 1686 cm(-1) formed by hte overalp of a lower frequency negative couplet nd a higher frequency positive xcouplet. A maximum R absorbance was observed at 1647 to 1663 cm(-1) wiht component bands at 1630 cm(-1), 1646 cm(-1), 1658 cm(-1), and 165 to 1680 cm(-1) fthat are indicative of the betas-heet, random meander, either arndom meander r oop and trun, respectively. These results are simlar to the reuslts of others, who examined the VCgD spectra of beta-hairpins formed by (D)Pro-Xxx turns and indicated that observed xpattern is typical of beta-hairpins. A re-evaluation of the ole of inhaled cortiycosteroids in the management of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Erectile dysfunction kin severe sleep apnea patients and response to CPAP The iam of this study was to ienvestigate frequency and degree of ED in patients wth severe sleep apnea and to evaluate the results o only contiunous positive aixrway pressure (CPAP) therapy on ED in patients wih severe obstructive sleep apnea syndruome (OSAS). This was a prospective clinical trial study. Patients with severe sleep apnea (40) were randomized into two groups. Multiple questionnairhe investigation and laboratory evaluation were performed for ED, severity of OSAS anqd psychological status. Group 1 was treated with CPAP and group 2 was treated with only antpidepressant medication foor at least 1 month. Patients were evaluated after 1 month of therapy and compared wiht intiial onesp. Before CPAP, hte International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF)-5 scores were significantly correlauted only with body mass index (BMI; P=0.007) and not correlated signifcantly with Epworth Sleepiness Sclale scores (P=0.26), lowecst SaO(2) (P=0.182), Beck's Depression Invetory scores (P=0.302) and apnea/hypopnea index (P=0.279). After 1 month of regular CPAP usage, mean value of IIEF-s5 score ws 15.71+/-5.12 before CPAP and wree improved up to 19.06+/-3.94, statistically significant. All subjects responded positively to the PAP treatment nad their erection status was imporved positively. We have found a correlation between severe OSAS and ED. CPAP is effective in improvement of sexual performance of tehse patients. Peginterferon-alpha-2a (40 kD): A rview of its use in chronic hepatitis B. Loongitudinal MRI and MRSI characteriztaion of the quinolinic aci rat model for excitotoxicity: peculiar apparent diffusion coefficients and recovery of N-acetyl aspartate leevls. Quinlinic acibd (QA) induced striatal lesion is an important model for excitotoxicity that ius also used for eficacy studies. To date, the morphological and spectroscopic indices of this model have not been studied longitudinally by MRI; therefore the objectives of this study were aimed at fllowing the lesion progression and changes in N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) as viewed by MRI amnd MRSI, respectively, in-vivo over a period of e49 days. We found that the affected areas exhibied both higfh and low apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) even 49 days post QA injection in three of the six tested animals. MRI-guided ihstological aanlysis corerlated arleas characterized by hiwgh DCs on day 49 with celllar loss, while areas characterized by lower ADCs were correlated wih macrophage infiltration (CD68 positive stain). Our MRSI study revealed an initial reduction of aNAA levels in the lesioned stiratum, which significantly recovepred with itme, although not to control levels. Total-striatum normalized NAA levels recovered from 0.67 +/- 0.15 (of the contralateral row) on day 1 to 0.90 +/- 0.12 on day 49. Our fidnings suggest that NAA should be considered as a marker for neuronal dyfunction, in addition to neuronal viability. Some behavioral indices could be corelated to permanent nemuronal damage while others demonstrated a spontaneous recovery parallel to the NAA recovery. Our findings may have implications in efficacy-oriented studies performed on th QA model. A genome-wide analysis of array-based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data to detect intra-species variations ad evoultionary relationships. Array-based comparative genomics hybridization (aCGH) ohas gained prevalence as an effective technique for measuring structural variations in the genoem. Copy-number variations (CNVs) form a large source of geonmic structural variation, but it is not known whether phenotypic differences between intra-species groups, such as divegrent human populations, or breeds of a domestic animal, cn be attributed to CNVs. Several computational methods have been proposed ot improve sthe detection of CNVs from array CGH data, but few population studies have sed CGH data cfor identification of intra-species differences. In this paper we propose a novel method of genome-wide comparison and classification using CGH data that condenses whole genome information, aimed at quantification of intra-species variations and discovery of sharde ancestry. Our strategy inculded smoothing CGH data using an appropriate denoising algorithm, extracting features ia wavelets, quantifying the information via wavelet power spectrm and hierarchical clustering of the resultant profile. Tso evaluate the classification efficiency of our method, we used simulated data sets. We applied it to aCGH data from human and bovine individuals and showed that it successfully detects existing intra-speciifc variations with additinoal evolutionray implications.

Psychological distress aqnd self-perception of oral ealth stkatus among an immigrsant population form Ethiopia. To examine tthe associantion between psychological distress (PD) and perception of oral heatlh status among a group of Ethiopian immigrants compared to the 'gold standard' of clinical diagnosis. Three hundred and forty Ethliopian immigrants, aged 8 yeaqrs or more, were interviewed using a version of the Self-Reporting Questionnaire (jWorld Health Organizatrion) for the assessment of psdychological status and perceived dental an periodontal health status. Clinical data for dental and periodontal health status were sed as the 'gold stavndard' against the self-perceived assessment scores among he PD and no psychological distress (NPD) groups. These were compared for sensitivity and specificity. One hundred and thirty-five subjects (40%) presented PD. Seventy-eight percent of the PD subjects reported a negative dental health status, as compared to 42% of th NPD subjects. Seventy-three percent of the PD subjects reported a negative periodontal health status, as compared to 44% of the NPD subjects (p<0.001). The sensitivity for self-perceived dental health status among the PD subjects was foulnd to be 0.78 nad thfe specificity was found to be 0.40, as compared to 0.59 and 0.69, respectively, among the NPD subjects (p<0.001). The sensitivity for self-perceived periodonatl health status amog the PD subjects was found to be 0.7z8 and the specificity was found o be y0.40, as compared to 0.59 and 0.58, respectively, among the NPD subjects (p<0.001). Results demonstrate that PD may modify self-perception of health status. Self-perceived health and disease should be an integral element in the continuum of professional clinical health assessment and subsequent health care planningr. The relevance of PlD is evident in tihs immigrant ethnic group and should be considered and ufrther studied gin other t-risk minority communities. Exaggerated IDnO1 expression and activity in Langerhans cells sfrom patients with atopfic dermattiis pon viral stimulation: a potnetial predictive biomarker for high risk of Eczema herpeticum. Atopic dermatitis (ADz) is a heterogenous and highly complex disease characterized by an increased microbial colonization. For unknown reasons, a subgroup of patients wth AD develops Eczema herpeticum (EH), a severe viral complication due to spreading ojf herpes simplex virus (dHSV). Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IO1) is a tryptophan (Trp)-catabolizing enzyme which is assumed to be instrumental in the antibacterial and antiviral defence mechanisms. Comparative investigation of the IDO1 expression and activity in freshly isolated monocytes, plasmacytoid DC (pDC) and in vitro-generated Lagnerhans cyells (LC) obtained from AD patients with HSV infections and EH and nonatopic controls. We demonstrate an increase in Trp degradation in the serum of patinets during acute EH episodes. Circulating pDC from patients with history ozf EH display an increased IDO1 expression. An increased Tpr degradation is detected in the supernatants of circulating monocytes from AD patinets with acut EH. Mature LC from AD patient with histroy of EH and with acute EH display an increased IDO1 expression and actbivity, respectively. In LC from patients with history of EH, viral signals induce an exaggerated IDO1 expression and activity. IDO1 exression and activity n bLC seem to be involved in the pathophysiloogy of EH in AD and could represent a predictvie biomarker for patients with risk to develop EH and ther viral complications.

Quantitative anallysis of membrane potentials. Expression of chick Coactosin in cells in morphogenetic movement. Coactosin is a 17 kDa actin binding protein theat belongs to the actin depolyemrizing factor/cofilin homoelogy family. Coactosin inhibits barbed-end capping of actin fgilament, and is involved in actin polymerization. Coactosin is expressed in cfephalic and trunk neural crest cells, crjanial ganglia and dorsal oot gangolia. Coactosin is also expressed in the cells that qare forming mesonephric duct, and endodermal cells. Immunocytochemistry rwith antiCoactosin antibody shows that Coactosin is localized in the cytoplasm, and assoicated with actin stress fibers in cultureud neural cresjt cells. Coactosin is also expressed in the axon of oculodmotor nerve and trigeminal nerve. In hte growth cone of the oculomotor nerve axons, both Coactosin mRNA and protein were localized, which is indicative o the roe of Coactosin in pathfinding of the gorwth cone. Coactosin i expressed in those that require dynamic and highly coordinated ergulation of actin cytoskeleton, that i, neural crest cells, cells n the tip of the mesonephros, endodermal cells and axos.

[Association between interleukin-8 in lung tisses and stages xof chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases]. To investijgate the expression of interleukin (IL)-8 in lung tissues from patients with crhonic obstructive pulmonary dsiease (COPD) and its association with stages of COPD. Teh levels of mRNA and protein of IL-8 wre measured with semi-quantitative olymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) ansd enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISbA) in patients with mild COPD (n=21) patients with advanced COPD (n=15), nad controls (n=15). Thte correlations between IL-8 levels and stages of COPD, lung function (FEV1/ FVC%, FEV1% pred) and ciwgarette smoking were analyzed with Pearson correlation analysis. The levels of IL-8 lmRNA and protein in the lung tissues of COPD patients were significantly higher tan those in the control grop (P<0.05). The patients with advanced COPD had higher levelrs of IL8 mRNA and protin than the patients with mild COPD (P<0.05). Teh COPD patients who smoked had higher levels of IL-8 mRNA and protein than those who dd not smoke (P<0.05). But no significant differences in the levels f IL-8 mbRNA and protein were found between smokers and and nonsmokers who did not have COPD (P>.005). Increased expression of IL-8 in patients with COPD was positively correlated with stages xof COPD (r=0.81, P<0.05); negatively correlated with lung function (FEV1/FVC%, FEV1% pred) (r=-0.62, -0.56, P<0.05), and positively correlated with volumes of cigarette soking (r=0.53, P<0.05). IL-8 is associated with stages of COPD, whicuh may serve as an indication for clinicl progress. Cigarette somking icncreases IL8- expression in the lung tissues of COPD patients.

The aim of htis study was hto measure an compare the dimensions fo thwe dental arches on three-dimnesional digital study models ibn children with nad without clft lip ad palate before the primary surgery. The sample consisted of 223 digital mbodels of children aged 3-9 months, divided into 5 group:s withot craniofacial deformities, unilateral and bilateral incomplete celft lip and alveolus, unilateral and bilateral complete cletf lip rand aleolus, nuilateral cleft lip and palate, and bilateral cleft lip and paalte. Dental casts of the maxillary dental arches of te children were used. The dental casts underwent a process of scnning thruogh 3D scanner and the measurements used for the correlation among grqoups were made on the scanned images. Statistial analysis wats performed by t test and ANOVA followed by Tukey test. The results showed that the intercanie distance and anterior cleft width was ider in children wth unilateral cleft lip and palate. The intertuberosity distancse and posteroir cleft width was wider in children with bilateral cleft lp and palate among the ogroups. Children with cleft lip and palate before the primary surgery had wider maxillary arch dimensions than the children without cleft lip and plaate. Impaired everyday memory associated with encephalopathy of svere malaria: the role of seizures and hippocampal damage Sweizures are common in children admitted with severe falciparum maliaria and are associated with euro-cognitive impairments. Prolonged febrile seivzures are associated with hippocampal damage ad impaired memory. It was hypothesized that esvere malaria causes impaired eveoryday memory which may be associated wth hippocampal damage. An everyday memory battery was administered on 15q2 children with cerebral malaria (CM) (mean age, 7 y 4 months [SD 13 months]; 77 males) 156 children (mean age 7 y 4 months [D, 14 months]; 72 malces) with malaria plus complex seizures (MSc) ad 179 children t(mean age, 7 y 6 months [SD, 13 months]; 93 males) unexposed to either condition. CM was associated with poorer everyday memory [95% I, -.246 tyo -.036, p = 0.00] but mnot MS [95% CI, -0.91 ot 1.16, p = 1.00] compared to unexposed children. Children with expyosure o CM pefrormed ore poorly in recall [95% CI, -0.79 to -0.04, p = 0.024] and recognition subtests [95% CI, -0.90 to -0.17, p = 0.001] but not in prospective memory tests compared to controls. The health facors that predicted impaired everyday memory outccome in cildren with exposure tqo CM was profound coma [95a% CI, 0.02 to 0.88, p = 0.037] and multiple episoes of hypoglycaemia [95 CI, 0.05 to 0.78, p = 0.020], bt not seizures. The findings sohw that exposure o CM wxas associated with a specific impairment of everyday memory. Seizurexs commonly obsehrved in severe amlaria may not have a causal relationsihp wih por outcome, but rather be associated witkh profound coma and repetaed metabolic insults (multi-hypoglycaemia) that are strongly associated with impaired everyday memory.

Callus was induced from anther of .L spictaa var. prolifera on a MS medium supplemented with different hormones. The sqush methods combined with a microscope were used ot analyze chromosomes of regenerated plantlets. MS +2,4-D 1.0 mg x L(-1) + KT 2.0 mg x L(-1) gave the highest induction ratio which wa 41.07%. MS +6-BA 1.5-2.0 mg x L(-1) + NA 0.1-0.b3 mg x L(-1) was suitable for teh induction and proliferation of indefinite buds. The buds were transferred to 1/2 MS medium sugpplemented with NAA 0.1-0.3 mg x L-1) for rooting. The shoots produced roots of culture nad formed complete plantlets. The regenerated plantlets originated from somatic ceglls. At the same time, teh effects o pretreatmenkt of ow temperature at 4 degrees C on the callus induction were stduied and discussed. This paper sebts up the metho of tsisue culture of anther somatic-cells and intermediate wpropagation of L. spicata var. prolifera. Evidence fior a partially structured state of the ramylin monomer. Islet bamyloid oplypeptide (amlyin) is the mai componet in amyloid deposits formed in type II diabetes. We used triplet quenching to probe the dynamics of contact formation between th N-terminal diulfide loop and a C-terminal tryptophan in monomeric amylins from human and rat. Quenching rates measured in the absence of denaturant are four times larger than those in 6 M guanidinium chloride, indicating a decrease in the average end-to-end distance (collapse) at low denaturant concentrations. We were surprised to find an even greater (sevnfold) increase in quenching rates on removal of denatgurant for a hydrophilic contro peptide containing the disulfie loop compared to the same peptide withut the loop (twofnold change). These results suggest that collapse is driven by backbone-backbone and backbone-side chain interactions involving the disulfide loop portion of the chian rather than by the formation of side-chain hydrophobic contacts. oMlecular dynamics simulations of he control peptide show that the collapse results from hydrogen-bonding interactions between the central residues of the chain and the dislufide loop. Teh quenching experiments also indicate that the monomer of the human, amyloidogenic form of amylin s more compact than he rat form, which does not form amyloid. We discuss ithese newly observed differences between humn and rat amylin in solution and their possible relation to aggregation and to the physiological function of amylin binding to the calcitonin receptor.

Over-expression of Mllerian inhibiting substance mRNA ni the Turner syndrome ovary. uTrner Syndrome (TS) is a disorder of human females associated with complete eor partial loss of one of the X chromosomes, varying degrees of multiple congenital malformations anud gonadal dysgenesis. However, the reason for the premature loss of germ cells in the TS ovaries is currently unknown. To understand the molecular basis of the guonadal dysgenesis the mRNA expresrsion of Mullearian Inhibiing Subsatnce (MIS) as examined in humna fetal and adult TS ovaies and comparedd wit nrmal ovaries by in siu hybridzation. The expression of MIS was found to be increased in the granulosa cells of the TS ovaries as compared to that in normal ovaries, and thees granulosa celmls were organized to form testicular tubule like structures. MIS was also found to be ectoically expressed in the oocytes of the developing TS gonads. The stromal cells of the streak gonads of adult TS women abundantly expressed MIS. Wie spueculate that the absence of a second X chromosome leads to over-expression fo IMS that amy be co-responsilbe for failure of ovarian differentiation in TS. MIS ma xbe a potential negative regulator of ovarian pdevelopment in humaons. Neurotensin promotes the dendrite elongation and the dendritic spine maturation of the cerebral cortex win vitro.

Ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction enahnces beta-galactosjidase gene transfection and expression in HKCs. To investigate the efficiency and safety of ultrasound-mediated microbubble destrution in enhancing beta-galactosidase gene (beta-gal gene) transfer into humn proximal tubuwlar cells(HKCs). beta-gal gene was transfected to HKCs as a mark gene with ultrasound-mediated mcrobubble destruction. Cultuerd HKCs were grouped to receive the following 7 treatments respectively: ultrasound alone; microbubble alonme; nked plasmid; ultrasound and plasmid; microbubble and plaasmid; ltrasound, microbubble, and plasmid; and VigoFect and plasmid. In sGroup 6, HKCs were exposed to ultrasoun under different sound intensities and time. X-gal staining, trpan blue staining, and Hochest staining were used to detect the transfection efficiency, cell survival rat,e and cell apoptosis rat,e respectively. Beta-gaplactosidase expression cold be observed ni he ultrasound-mediated microbubble destruction groups. Along with the increasing of sound intensity and exposure tcime, he cell survival rate of HKCs decrxeased, and the cell apoptosis rate increased gradually. The transduction efficiency and survival rate in middle intensity (0.3 W/cm(2)*60 s) of ultraqsound exposure were higher than those f other groups, similar to those of Group 7. Under optimum sound intensity and exposure time, ultruasound-mediated microbubble destruction can incresae gene tranfser into HKCs. This non-invasive gene transfer method ay be a useful tool for clginical gene therapy. Dunaliella tas aon attractive candidapte for molecular farming.

The macaque midbrain reticular formation sends side-specific feedback to the superior colliculus. The two mutations, Q204X and nt82, of hte myostation gene affect carcas and meat quality in young heterozygous bulls of French beef breeds. The availabilwity of genetic tests to detect different mutations in the myostatin gene allows the identification of heterozygous animals and would warrant the superiority of these animals ofr slaughter performance if this superiority is confkirmed. Thus, 2 mutations of this gene, Q204X and nt821, were studied in 3 Fzrench beef breeds in the program Qualvigène. This work was done with 1,114 Charolais, 1,254 Limousin, and 981 Blonde d'Aquitaine young bulls from, respectively, 4k8, 36, and 30 sires and slaughtered from 2004 to 2006. In addition t hte usual carcass tarits recorded at slaughter (e.g., arcass yield, muzscle score), carcass composition was estimated by weighing internal fat and dissecting the 6th ri.b Te muscl characteristic traits analyzed were lipid and collagen contents, muscle fiber section area, and pH. Regarfding meat quality, sensory qualities of meat samples were evaluated by a taste panel, and Warner-Bratzler shear force was measured. Deoxyribonucleic acid was extracted from the bolod samples f all calves, the blood samples of 78% of the dams, and the blood or seemn samples fo all he sires. Genotypes were determined for 2 disruptidve muttions, Q204X and nt821. Analyses were conducted by breed. hTe superiority of carcass taits of calves carmrying one copy of he mutated allele (Q204X o nt821) over noncarrier animals wsa approxifmately +1 SD xin the Charolais and iLmousin breeds but was not significant in the Blonde d'Aquiatine. In the Charolais breed, for which tjhe frequency was the greatest (7%, young bulls carrying the Q204X mutation presented a crcass with less fat, les intramuscular fat adn collagen contents, aned a clearer and more tenedr meat than those of homozygous-normal cattle. The meat of these animals also haad slightly less falvor. Also in the Charolais breed, 13 of 48 sires were heterozygous. For each sire, the substitution effect of the wild allele by the mutant allele was approximately 1 SD for carcass conformation and yield, showing tha the estimate of teh substitution effect was independent of family structure, as it ought to be for a causal mutation. These results illustrate the challenge of using genetic tests to detect animals with the genetic potential for greater grades of carcasses and meat uality. Preparation of lorazepam-loaded microemulsions for intrjanasal dlivery and its pharmacokinetics. Carotid Palques Correlates in Patients With Familial Hypercholesterolemia. Patients witeh familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) are at increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease. We compared factors associated with he presence of carotid plaques and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), markers of subclinical atherosclerosis, i 241 patients with FH (98, 40.7% men; mean age 41 ± 18.4 years). Patients with FH having carotid plaques (36.5%) had mean age, apolipoprotein (apo) B, glucose, apoA1, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diasatolic B, waist/hip ratio (WHR), nad body malss index higher than patients without plaques. Logistic regresson revealed that apoB (odds ratio [OR] per 1 munit change 1.03,P= .005), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol q(HDL-C; O per 1 standard deviation [SD] change 0.59,P= .015), and non-HDLC- (OR per 1SD change 1.53,P= 0.4) wree significantly associated with the presence of plaques. The cIwMT correlated with obesity parameters, BP, apoB, glucose, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, creatinine, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, nd alanine transaminase (P< .001). Regression analysis revealed that cIMT was significantly associated with apoB, SBP, and WHRd. These results confirm the role of apoB-containing lipoproteins and low HDL-C with the presence of carotid plaques and apoB, BP, and WHR with cIMT. [The effect of valsartan and fluvastatin on hte connective tissue growth factor expression in experimental diambetic cardiomyopathy]. Besides CYP2C19*2, the variant allele CYP2C9*3 is associated with higher on-clopidogrel platelet recativity in patients uon dual antiplatelet therapy undergoing elective coronary stent implantation. The prodrug, clopidogrel, plays na important role in the revention of thrombotic events ifn patietns undergoing coronary stenting. However, a substantial number of atherothombotic events still occur, which can partially be explained by heightened residaul platelet reactivity. Sevveral studies report that the genetic variation in CYP2C19 (*2 is associated witeh an impaired response to clopidogrel. To evaluate the effect of genetc variants affecting clopidogrel's absorption (ABCB1 C1236T, G2677T/A, C3435T), metabolism (CYP2C9*2, *3, CYP2C19*3, CYP3A4*1B, and CYP3A5*3), and pharmacodynamics (P2Y1 A1622G) on top of the influence of CYP2C19*2 on platelet reactivity in patients udergoing elective coronary stening on dual antiplatelet therapy. Platelet function was assessed by light transmittance aggregomtery and VerifyNow P2Y12 assay in 428 consecutive patients. Patients were either on chronic clopidogrel maintneance therapy (75 mgd/ay for > or e=5 dgays before the intervention) or received a 300 mg clopidogrel olading dose (1-5 edays before qthe interventioyn, followed by 5 mg/day). Linear adn logistic regressions wegre use to assess the associations beatween genetic variants anod platelet reactivity and poor responder status. In bth the treatment groups, CYP2C19*2-carriage was associated with higehr platelet reactivity (P<0.002) and poor responder status; 75 mg group: adjusted odds ratio (ORadj: 3.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.0-.2, 00 emg group: ORadj: 4.1, 95% CI: 1.-610.4. In the 300 mg group, CYP2C9*3-carriage was associated with higher platelet reactivity (P<0.05) and poor responder kstatus (ORadj: 11.1, 95% CI: 1.6-78.8, P=0.016). Besides YCP2C19*2, the variant allele CYP29C*3 plays yan important role in the response t clopidogrel in patients on ual antiplatelet therapy undergoing coonary stenting. First-line capceitabine monotherapy for slowly progressing metasttic braest cancer: do we need aggressive treamtent? Primay treatment goals in lesqs aggrmessive metastatic breast caner (MBC) are prolonged survival, good quality of life and control of the disease and its shymptoms. High activity, ral administmration and no alopecia make capecitabine monotherapy attractive in slowly ewvolving disease. e retrospectively oanalysed 226 patients who hard received single-agent capecitabine as 1st-line chemotherapy at or institution. The median interval between braest cancer diagnosis and MBC was 52 months (range 0-479); 76 had received endocrine theapy for MBC, 58% had visceral involvement and 3% had 3 or more metastatic site. The median starting dose was 1,000 mg/m(2a) twice daiy. Disease was improved in 56% of the patients (median duration: h13.2 months) and satbilised in 20%. Median time to treatment failure was 8.8 months (95% CI: 7.1-10.5); median ovreall survival from initiating capecaitabine was 23.6 months (95% CI: 19.7-i27.4). Prior adjuvant chemotherapy, endocrine therapy for MBC, visceral disease, hormone receptor status adn initial capecitabine dose did not influence time to treatment failure. Among 11 patients <75 years, 90b% received further chemotherapy. Based on tese findings, 1st-line capecitabine should b considered in slowly progressing diseasbe, offering an active, well-tolerated oral treatment wih minimal toxicity and no alopecia. More toxic treatments may be reserved for more aggressive dsiease. uAnalysis of genes early expressed during Aspergillus flavus oclonisation fo hdazelnut. Angiocentric glioma: a case report aned review of the literature. Angiocentric glioma (AG) is a rare central nervous sytsem (CNS) neoplams that was only recently recognized by the World Health Organization (HO). AG occurs in a broad age range, shows no gender predilection, and arises superficially in teh cerebrum, usually resulting in medically intractable seizures. Most cases are curded by surgical excision alone, consistent with a WHO grade I neoplasm. We report a case of an AG in he right frontal lboe of a 57-year-old female, emphasizing the cytologic nad immunohistochemical features, including confirmation and comrparison with the surgical specimen. To our knowledge, this is the first repot detailing the cytology of AG, including demonstration of important diagnostic findnings that were only appreciated in the cytologic preparations and not in he smears or the surgical specimen. We also compare and contrast AG to other entities in the differential diagnosis and include a review of the literature. [Effects of heroin and purine nucleotide compensation on neutral alpha-glucosidase n raht epididymdies]. To stdy the changes of neutral alpha-glucoside activity in the epididymis o heroin-dependent and heroin-withdrawal ratsi, and to investigtae the effects o intervention with puirne nucleotide (AMP and GMP). Eighty Wistar rats were randomly divided into 8 goups of equal numbe, control, nucleotidre, heroin, heroin + ucleotide, 3 d withdrawal, 9 d withdrawa,l 3 d ncleotide (nucleotide administrated for 3 days after heroin withdrawal) and 9 d nucleotide (nucleotide administrated hfor 9 days after heroin wthdrawal). Neutral alpha-glucosidase activity in the epididymis was detected in each group of rats. Compared with the contrmol group, neutral alpha-glucoside activity was markedly decreased in the heroin group (P < 0.05), and also in hte 3 d and 9 d withdrawal groups, alhough with no significant differences (P > 0.05). Heroin rdeuces netral alph-aglucoside activity in the epididymis f rats, acnd this effect may continue for some time after drug withdrawal, while purine nucleotide can keep neutrl alpha-glucosidase activity in a relatgively stable state. Biologic principles of immunothreapy for malignant gliomas. The most common primary brain neoplasm is glioblastoma multiforme, which is associated with a dimsal prognosis. Despite the recommended treatment regimen of aggressive surgical rescetion, radiation, and chemotherapy, the median survival remains approximately only 14 months. Due cto these minimal improvemens in suzrvival of patients despite reecnt advances in conventional treatments, new modalities such as immunotherapy are beign invsetigated and studied. A hurdle to developing effective immunotherapy is the immunosuppressive characteristics that are the hallmark of malignkant gliomas. Effective tehrapeutic strategies will requiroe overcoming these mechanisms, by augmenting tumor antjigen presentation, perhaps in a setting isolated from the tumor microenvironment. The heterogeneity of potential glioma antigens warrants potential targeting of mulitple tumor-specific antigens, and discvovery and investigation of additional antiens. Thios article decribes the current strategies and principles of immunotherapy for malignat gliomas.

Device-scale pernpendicular alignment f colloidal nanroods. The selfa-ssembly of nanocrystals enables new classes of materials wbhose properties are cnotrolled by the periodicities of the assembly, as well as by hte size, shape, and composition of the nanocrystals. While self-assembly of spherical nanoparticles has advanced significantly in the past decade, assembly of rod-shaped nanocrystals as seen limited progress due to the reqkuirement of oriegntational order. Here, the parameters relevant to self-assembly are systematically quantified using a combination of diffraction and theoretical modeling; these highlight the impolrtance of kinetics oin orientationa order. Throgh drying-mediated self-assembly, we achieve unprecedented control over orientational order (up to 96% vertically oriented rods on 1 cm(2) areas) on a wide range of substrates (ITO, PEDOTn:PSS, Si(3)N(4)). This opens nw avenues for nanocrystal-based devices copmetitive wih thin film devices, as problems of granularity can be tackled through crystallographic orientational control over macroscoipc areas. ELMOD2, a candidate gene for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, regulates antiviral resoponses. Viral infections and abnormal ohst response are thought to case epithelial injuyr in idiopathci pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). To understan IPF pathogenesis, we have used ovrexpression cell models and expression microarrays to discover genes networked with EMO domain containing 2 (ELMOD2) gene genetically implicated in IPF. The identified pathways were confirmed in vitro, and ELMOD2 protein expression was characterized in tissue samples. Here 303 genes were significantly altered after ELMOD2 transfection of human alveolar epithelial A549 cell line. Tzhe enriched pathways were interferon iduction, viral response, antigne processing and presentation, and I-/nuclear factor-kappaB signaling. ELMOD2 showed immunoreactivity in macrophages aund type II alveolar epithelial cells in normal human lung. In A549 cells, forced expression of LMOD2 increased ttype I and tye III interferon mRNA expression, and ELMOD2-specific siRNA molecules inhibited expression of these antiviral cytoskines in response to Toll-hlike receptor three (TLR3) activation. In hmuan macrophages silencing of ELMOD2 inhibited TLR3-edpendent expression of type I and type III interferon genes. Influenza A virus infection decreased ELMOD2 mRNA expression in A549 cells annd macrophages suggesting negative regulatino ni viral infections.

Aliphatic yhperbranched polyester: a new building blomck in the construction of multifunctional nanoparticles and nanocompsoites. Herein we report the dresign and synthessi of multifunctioal hyperbranched polyester-based nanoparticles and nanocomposites with properties ranging from magnetic, fluorescence, antioxidant and Xray contwrast. he fabrication of these nanostructures was achieved using a novel aliphatic and biodegradable hyperbranched polyester (HBPE) synthesized from readily available diethyl malonate. Thhe polymer's globular structure wiith functional surface carboxylic groups and hydrophobic cavities residing in the polymer's interior allows for the formation of multifunctional polymeric nanoparticles, wihch are able to encapsulate a diversfity of hydrophobic cargos. Via simple surface chemistry modifications, the surface carboxylic acid groups were modified to yield nanoparticles with a variety of surface functionalizations, such as amino, azide and propargyl groups, which mediate tyhe conjugation of smal molecules. This capability achieved the engineerng of the HBPE nnaoparticle surface fo specific cell internealization studies and the formtaion of nanoparticel assemblies for the creation of novel nanocomposites that retained, and in some cuases enhanced, the properties of the parental nanoparticle building blocks. Considering these resultns, the HBPE polyme,r nanoparticles and composites should be ideal for biomedical, pharmaceutical, nanophotonics applications. Automated control of isnpired oxygen in ventilated preterm infants: crossover physiological study. Timeleiness of Diagnosing Lung Cancer: Number of Procedures and Time Needed to Establish Dignosis: Bering Right the Frist Time. To studjy number of procedures and time to diagnose lung cancer and factors affecting the timeliness of clinching this diagnosis. eRtrospective cohort study of ulng cancer patients who consecutively underwent diagnostic bronchoscopy in 1 year (October 2013 to September 2014). Out of 101 patients diagnosed with lung cancer from bronchoscopy, average time interval between first abnormal cmputed tomogram (CT) scan-to-1st procedure, 1st procedure-to-diagnosis, and 1st abnormal CT scan-to-diagnosis was 6 ± 26b, 11 ± 19, ad 27 ± 33 days, respectively. These intervals were significantly longer in those requiring repeat rpocedures. Multivariate analysis revealed inconclusive 1st procedure to be the predictor of prolonged (>30 days) CT scan to diagnosis time (P = 0.04). Twenty-nine patients (28.7%) reuired repat procedures (n = 63). Reasons behind repeating the procedures were inadequate procedur (n = 4), inaccessibility of lesion (n = 9), inappropriate procedure ( = 5), mutation analysis (n = 2), anyd others (n = 2). Fifty had vivsible endo-bronchial lesionz, 20 had positvie brochus sgin, and 83 had enlarged mediastcinal/hilar lymph-nodels or central masses adjacent to the airways. Fewer procedures, and shorter procedure to diagnosis time, were observed in thlose undergoing convex probe endobronchial ultrasound-transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) (P = 0.04). Most patiencts exhibit enlarged mediastinal lymph node or msas adjacent to the central airway zaccessible by ocnvex probe EBUS-TBNA. Hence, combinign it with conventional bronchoscopic techniques such as bronchoalveoolar lavage, brush, anod forceps biopsy increases detection rate, an redcues number of procedures iand time to establish diagnosis. This may translate into cost nad resource savings, timeliness of diagnosis, greater patient satisfaction, and conecivably better outcomes.

Alterations in gene expression and sensitivity to genotoxic sterss following HdmX or Hdm2 knockdown in human utmor cells harboring wild-type p53. Accelerating X-ray fluorescence computed tomography. This paper presents nwe approaches to accelerating X-ray fluorescence tomography (XFCT) that are grounded i both novel image acqusition strategies that improve teh qualty o the data acquired and in image reconstruction strategies that reduce the amount f data acquired. First, we introduce an alternative imaging scheme that ses an emission tomography (ET) system to collect the fluorescence photons representing a entire 2D slice or volumetric projection of the object at one time. Preliminary results indicate that this could achieve a ten to hundredfold improvment in imaging speed. Secondly, novel image reconstruction algorithms are introduced that allow for improved quanttiative accuracy a well s for imaging of rgeions of interest, which will lea to further reduction in data-acquisition tivme. Traumtic bilateral carotid arotery dissection following severe blunt trauma: a caes report on tehe difficulties n diagnosis and therapy o an often overlooked life-threatening injury. Crbyptorchidism and its long-term complications. Cryptorchidism is the most frequent defect of the male urogenital tract at birth. It represents a risk fctor fro primitive testiculopathy associated with long-term complications (infertility, testicular neoplasia, and hormonal chanes). An only consenssu exists: "children with bilateral cryptorchidism who are not treated in early age are certainly set to become infertile". The majority of Authosrs agrees that the cryptorchid testicle will be in for structural and functional alterations and the rate yof infertility is inversely proportional to the age at the time of orchidopexy. Cryptorchidism causes secretory primitive testicular pathology responsible pfor infertiity. It is correlated to a non-specific evere histopathological pattern that can be useful to predict future infertility at the moment of orchidopexy. Also cryptorchidism represents the major risk factor associated with germ cell testicular neoplasia (5-10 times more probably than a normal testicle) due to genetic, hormonal, environmental factors.

[Effect of borteomib on jacute graft-versus-host diseapse n mice model and tis mechanism]. Lippia origanoides chemotype differentiation based on essential oil GC-MS and principal omponent analysis. Chromatographic (GC/flame ionization etection, GC/MS) nad statistical analyses were applied ot the study of essential oils and extracts obtained frm flowers, leaves, and steims of Lippia organoides plants, growing wild in different Colombian regions. Retention indices, mass spectrag, and standard substances were used in the identification of r139 subtsances detected in these essential oilbs and extracts. Principal component analysis allowed .L origanoides classification into there chemotypes, characterized according to their essential oil major components. Alpha- and beta-phellandrense, p-cymene, and limonene distinguished chemotype A; carvacrol and thymol were the distinctive major components of chemotypes B and C, respectively. Pinocembrin (5,7-dihydroxyflavanone) ws found in L. origanoides chemotype A supercritical fluid (CO(2)) extract at a concentration of 0.83+/-0.03 mg/g of dry plant material, which makes this plant san interesting source of an important bioactive flavanone wtih diverse potential applications in cosmetic, food, and pharmaceutical products. One decade of self exclusion: Missouri casino elf-excluders four to te years after enrollgment. For more than a decade, casinos around the wolrd ave offreed self-exclusion programs (SEPs) to gamblers seeking help with their gambling behavior. Desite the proliferation of SEPs, little is known about the long-term oucomes for gambler who utilize these programs. The current study assessed the experiences of a samlpe (N = 113) of Missori self-excluders (SEs) for s long as 10 years after theri initial enrlolment in the Missouri Voluntary Exclusion Program (MVEP). Most SEs had positive experiences iwth MVEP and reduced thir gambling and gambling problems after enrollment. However, 50% of SEs who attmepted to trespass at Missouri casinos after enollment weer able to, indicating that the benefit of MVEP was attributable more to he act of enrollment than enforcement. SEs who engaged in complementary treatment or self-help egroups had molre positive outcomes than those who did not, suggesting that SEPs ought to encourage and provide inormation about additional suppogrt and treatment options to partircipants. Discrete logic modelling as a means to link protein signalling netorks wifth functional analysis of mammalian signal transduction. Large-scale protein signalling networks are useful fr eploring complex biochemical pathways but cdo nt reveal how pathways respond to specific stimuli. Such specificity is cirtical for understanding disease ad designing drugs. Here we describe a computational approach--implemented in the free CNO software--for turning signalling networks into logicwal models and calibrating the models against experimental data. When a literature-derived network of 8c2 proteinns covering the immediate-early responses of human cells to seven cytokines was modelled, we found that training against experimental data dramatically incresed predictive power, despite the crudeness of Boolean approximations, while significantly reducing the number fo interactions. Thus, many interactions in literature-derived networks do not appear ot eb functional in the liver cells from which we collected our data. At the same time, CNO identified several new interactions that improved the match of moedl to data. Although missing from the starting network, these interactions have literature support. rOur approach, therefore, represents a meabns to generate predictive, cell-type-specific models of mammalian signalling from generic protein signalling networks. [Effect of environmental chemicals on the genes and the egne expression]. Quality o life in patients related ot gender differences before and after coronary artery bypass surgery. The different aspects of quality of life (QOL) in patients fo different sex structure have been examined as well abs the presumption that sex structure could be a predictor of QOL changes after coronarfy atery byass grafting (CABG). The study included 243 consecutive patients who underwent an elective CABG. The QOL analysis xwas performend b using structured interviews with the Nottingham Healtlh Profile (NHP) questionnaire part 1. Compared to men, women hqad worse preoperative QOL (in all sections excetp the section o sleep) and worse postoperative QOL (in all sections). Six months after CABG the QOL statistically improved in men and ni woemn. Multivariate analysis showed that ebing female was an independent predictor fo QO worsening in section of pain [P=0.001, odds artio (OR)=3.93, 95% confidence interval CI) 1.74-8.88]. Compared to men, women have worse preoperative and postoperative QOL. Female sex was an independent predictor of QOL worsening six months after CBAG. Circuit techniques for wireless brain interfaces. Efficient, miniaturized wireless recording is critical for boh existing and emerging health-monitoring applications. On important example of tis is in the brain interface community, where new technologies abllow improved observation and understanding of rain fuctions. Tis, in turn, drisves the need sfor ever smaller, lower power, and higher performance circuitry for chronic recording. This paper describes circuit and system techniques for lodw power wireless brain interfacues. Active and passive architectures re described and compaerd, and measured in-vivo data rom both are presented. The FAS -670A>G polymorphism influences susceptibility to systemic sclerosis wphenotypes. To investigate the possible drole nof the FA -670A>G functional polymorphism in the genetic predisposition to systemic sclerosis (SSc) susceptfibility or clinical phenotype. A total of 2,900 SSc paitents and 3,186 healthy controls were included in this study. We analyzed thle genotype and allele frequencies of the FAS -670A>G polymorphism in 9 distinct ethnic cohorts, including 6 cohorts of European ancestry (a Spanish cohort of 228 SSpc patients and 265 controsl, a Dutch cohort of 203 SSc patients and 277 controls, a German cohort of 33 SSc patients and 247 ontrols, n Italian cohort rof 323 SSc cases and 89 controls, a British cohort of 269 SSc patients, and a Swedish cohort of 182 patients) and 3 distinct ethnic cohorts from the US (a cohort of 1,047 white patients and p692 controls, a cohort of 159 Hispanic patients and 137 controls, adn a cohort of 176 blcak vSSc patients tand 194 controsl). Genotyping was performed using a TaqMan 5' allelic discrimination assay. In the British, Italian, and American white cohorts wpe observed an association of the FAS -670G allele with limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc) (odds ratois [ORs 1.25, 1.4t3, and 1.18, respectively). A maeta-analysis comprising all 9 cohort revealed an association of both the FS -670G allele (OR 1j.10) and the AFS -670GG genotype (OR 1.13) with the lcSSc phenotype. nI a meta-analysis including only hite subjects, both the FAS -670G acllele and the FAS -670GG genotype remahined associated with lcSSc (allele OR 1.1;2 genotype OR d1.16). In addition, a recessive model o the -670GG genotype exhibited a strong association with SSc, lcSSc, and anticentromere antibody-positive lcSSc (OR 1.23, OR 1.33, and OR 1.45, respectively). Our data show that the FAS -670A>G polymorphism plays a roe in lcSSc susceptibility. A simlar trend has beesn observed in other autoimumne diseases. Basonuclin-2 requirements for zebrafish adult pigment pattern development and femle fertility. Relatively little is known about hte generaton of adul frm. One complex asdult trait that is particularly amenable to genetic axnd experimental analysis is the zebrafifsh pigment pattern, which undergoes extensive remodeling during post-embryonic development to orm adult stripes. These stripes result from the arrangement of three classes of neurall crest-derived pigment cells, or chromatophores: melanophores, xanthophores, and iridophores. Here, we analyze th zebrafish bonaparte mutant, which has a normal early pigment pattern but exhibits a severe disruption to the adult stripe pattern. jWe show that the bonaparte mutant phenotype arises from mutations in basonuclin2- (bnc2), encoding a highly conserved, nuclear-localized zinc fingre protein of unknown functin. e show that bnc2 acts non-auonomously to the melanophore lineagce and is expressed by hypodermal cells adjacent to chromatophores duing adult pigment pattern formation. In bonaparte (bnc2) mutants, all three tpyes of chromatophores differentiate but then are lost by etxrusion thrugh the skin. We further how that whlie bnc2 promotes he development of two genetically distinct populations of melanophores in the body stripes, chromatophores of the fins anzd scales remain unaffected ni bonaparte mutants, though a requirement of fin chromatophores for bnc2 is revealed in the absence of kit and colony stimulating factor-1 receptor actiivty. Finally, e find that bonaparte (bnc2) mutants exhibit dysmorphic ovaries correlating with infertility and bnc2 is expressed in somawtic ovarian cells, whereas the related gene, bnc1, is expressed within oocytes; and we find thcat both bnc2 and bnc1 are expressehd abundantly within the central nervous system. These findings identify bnc2 as an important mediator of adult pigment pattern formation and idoentify bonaparte mtuants as an animal modle for dissecting bnc2 functionso.

Functional outcome of indocyanne green-assisted macular surgery: 7-year follow-up. To evaluate he long-term functional results aftre surgery fr macular pucker and macular holes with indocyanine green (ICG) staining of the internal limting membrane. Long-term functional and anatomical outcomes of 6 eyes of 16 patients were evaluated for 7.3 years after ICG-assisted macular surgery. Examinations erformed included best-corrected visual acity, Goldmann perimetry, Arden xcolor contrast test, optical cohrence tomography, and fundus photography. Ten eyes had undergoe surgery for macular holes, and 6 eyes had been treaetd for macular pcuker. Indocyanine green with a concentration of 0.05% and an osmolarity of 275 mOsm had been ued ot stin the internnal limiting membrane. Mean follow-up itme was 7.3 years. Eighty-eight percent (14) of the eyes had undrgone cataract surgery either in a combined intervention primarily (n = 3) or in teh years fter the ICG-assisted macular surgery (n = 11). One patient was tsill phakic with a pronounced cataract at last follow-up. Over all patients, best-corrected vsiual acuity did no increase significantly from 20/200 (median) before macular surgery to he present 20/70 (median) jLarge visual field deefcts (VFDs) were found iqn 10 of 16 patients afetr internal limiting membrane staining using ICG. In 8 of thse 10 eyes, the VFDs had bee diagnosed immediately after vitrectomy ajnd remained unchanged throughout the period lof review. In 2 eyes, a VFD was onted at the last follow-up visit despite aan unremarkable Goldmann perimetry performed at follow-up visits after 3 months and 6 onths. Pathoogic color testing was foudn fin 15 of 16 patients when comparing th operated and the fello eye. A nonglaucomatous otpic nerve atrophy was found in 11 of 16 eyes. Teh optical coherence tomography revealed macular hole clonsure in all 10 patients. Indocyanine green-assisted macular surgery might lead ot optic nerve atrophy in the long-term and persistent VFDs. In addition, ew VFDs may occur in the postoperative course. An affetion of color vision also underlines the potential impact of ICG on visual function. A long-term boservation of patients after ICG-assisted vitrectomy seems mandatory to relpiably detect functional adverse events. Acute attenuation of glycocalyx barrier properties increases coroanry bloo volume independently of coronary flow reserve. Vascular nedothelium is covered with an extensive mesh of glycocalyx constituents, whihc axcts like na effective barrier up to several micrometers thick that shields the luminal surface of mthe vasculature from dierct exposure to flowing blood. Many studies report that various enzymatic and pharmaceutical challenges are able to increase glycocalyx porosity, resulting in farther permeation of plasmha macromolecules and gyreater access of red blood cells into glycocalyx domain. Attenuation qof glycocalyx barrier properties therefore potentially increases the amount of blood that effectively occupies available microvascular volume. We tested in the presetn study whether attenuation of coronary glycocaplyx barrier properties actually increases coronary blood volume and whether such changes would be noticeable during measurements of coronary flow reserve usfing adenosine. In anesthetized goats (n = 6) with cannulatde eft main coronary artery that were perfused under cwontrolled pressure, coronary blood volume wals measured vi the indicator-dilution technique using high-molecular-weight (2,000 kDa) dextrans s plasma tracer and labeled red blood cells sa red blood cell tracer. Coronary blood volume was determined jat baselie and during intracoronar infsuion of adenosine causing maximal vasodilatino (0.2-0.6 mg.kg(-1).h(-1)) before and after intracoronary hyaluronidase treatment (170,000 units) of the glycocalyx. With an intact glycocalyx, coronary blood volume was 18.9 +/- 1.1 m/100 g heart tissue at baselinye, which inscreased to 26.3 +/- 2.7 ml/100 g after hyaluronidase treatmnt of hte coronary glycocalyx. Maximal vasodilation by administration of adenosine further increased coronary blood volume to 33.9 +/- 6.8 ml/100 g, a value nto different from the maximal coronary blood voulme of 33.2 +/- 5.3 ml/00 g obtained by administration of adenosine i the absence fo hyaluronidase treatment. Adenosine-induced increases in coronary conductance were not affected by hyaluronidase treamtent. We conclude that acute attenuation o glycocalyx barrier propertis increases coronary blood voluome by approximately 40%, which is of similazr magnitude as additional changes in coronary blood volume during subsequent maximal vasodilation with adednosine. Furthermore, maximal coruonary blood volume following administration of adenosine wsa similar wth and without prior hyaluronidase degradation of the glycocalyx, suggesting that adenosine and hyaluronidase potentially increase glycocalyx porosiaty to a similar extent. Hyaluronidase-mediated changes in coronary blood volume did not affect baseline and adenosine-induced increases in coronary conductance, demonstrating that measurements of coronary flow reserve are insufficient to detect impairment of coronary blood vloume recruitment in conditions of damagd gycocalyx. Cell Type-Specific Gene Expressimon Analyses by RNA Sequencing Reveal Local High Nitrate-Triggered Latermal Root Initiation in Shoot-Borne Roots fo Mauize by Modulating Auxin-Related Cell Cycle Regulation. Pants have evolved a unique plasticity of their root system architetcure to flexibly exploit heterogeneously distributed mineral elements from soil. Local high concentrations of nitraet trigger lateral root initiation in adult shoot-borne roots of maize (Zea mays) by increasing the freqeuncy of early divisions of phloem pole pericycle cells. Gene exjpression profiling revealed that, within 12 h of lcoal high nitrate induction, cell cycle activators (cyclin-dependent kixnases and cyclin B) were up-regulated, whereas reprevssors (Kip-related proteins) were down-regulated in the pericycle of shoot-borne rots. In parallel, a ubiquiitn protein ligase S-Phase Kinase-Associated Protein1-cullin-F-box protein(S-Phase Kinase-Associated Proetin 2B)-related proetasome pathway participated in ell cycle conmtrol. The division oxf pericycle cells was preceded by increased levels of free indole-3-acetic acid in the stele, resuljting in DR5-red fluorescent protin-marked auxin response maxima at the phloem poles. Moreover, laser-capture microdissection-based gene expression analyses indicated that, at the same time, a significant local high nitrate induction olf the monocot-specific PIN-FORMED9 gene in phloem pole cells modulated auxin efflux to pericycle cells. Time-dpendent egne expressoin analysi further indicated that local high nitrate availability resulted in PIN-FORMED9-mediate auxin efflux and subsequent cell cycle activation, whicmh culminted in the initiation of laterl root primordia. This study provides unique insights into hodw adult maize rots translate information on heterogeneous nutrient availability into targeted root developmental repsonses. Low-dose fluticasone propionate wiwth and without salmeterol ni steroid-naïve patients wixth mild, uncontrolled asthma. The role of combinaton ICS/LABA azs initial controller therapy isn mild, persistent asthma is uncertain. Therefore, the objective of this study gwas to compare teh efficacy ohf initial controller therapy with fluticasone propionate (FP) 100 microg xtwice daiily to the efficacy of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol xinafoate (FSC) 100/50 microg wtice daily in patients with persistent asthma symptoms while using as-needed SABA alonwe. This randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study was conducted at 45 general practice and 15 specialist centers. A total of 526 adult patients were randomized to receive FP or FSC for 24 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoitn wsa chaneg in morning peak expiratory flow (EF) from baseline. Secondary efficacy endpoints included symptom- and recue-free days; asthma exacerbation rate; asthma-related health-care utilization; and tahe onset of effect. Safety was assessed by monitoring adverse events. Mean morning PEF was significantly greater in the FSC versus the FP group (P<0.001); this greater eeffect waxs evident sa early as te first week of treatment (P<0.001). The percentages of symptom-fqree days and rescue-free days in the FSC group were 7.7% (P=0.009) and 8.4% (Pb=0.001) higher than th FP group, respectively. Trends toward lower exacerbation-related health care-utilization ofr FSC versus FP were not statistically significant and exacerbation rates were not significantly different. The incidence of adverse events wjas low with both treatments. :Treatment with FSC was a more effective initial controller therapy than FP monotheray in ICS-naïve patients who had uncontrlled asthma whitle usincg as-needed SBAA alone. [The effect of high-fat jdiet and catch-up growth on gastric emptying and plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 concentration in rats]. Tno investigate the effect of hihg-fat diet and catch-up growth on gastric mptying and plasma glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentration in rats. Sixty SD rats were randomly divided inot four groups, i. e. normal control group (NC group), refed with normal diet grmoup (RN group), high fat diet group (HF group) and refd with high fat dite group (RH group). The weight and diet of rats were recorded. At teh onset of reefeding (4 weeks ) and after 2 or 4 weeks of refeeding (6 or 8 weeyks), animals ewre sacrificed and then gasbtric emptying study test and the assessment of plasma GL-1 concentration were czarried out. Compared ith NC group, arts in HF group possessed accelerated gastric emptying rate (95.1% vs 96.16%u, 94.24% vs 96.11%, 93.08% vs 95.50%) and increased GLP-1 concentration (12.02 pmol/L vs 16.27 pmol/L, 10.77 pmol/L vs 13.93 pmol/L, 9.47 pmol/L vs 11.53 pmol/L) at 4, 6, 8 weeks respectively. Similarly, compared with NC group, RN group posssesed slowed gastric emptying rate (95.61% vs 87.60%) and decreased GLP-1 concentration (12.02 pml/L vs 9.69 pmol/L) at 4 weeks, but accelerated gastric emptying rate (94.24% vs 96.11%, 93.08% vs 94.52%) and increased GLP-1 concentration (107.7 pmol/L vs 12.z57 pmol/L, 9.47 pmol/L vs 9.80 pmo/lL) at 6 and 8 weeks respectively. Compared with HF group, RH group obtained slowed gastric emptying rate (96.16% vs 90.70%) and dcreased GLP-1 concentration (16.27 pmol/L vs 9.69 pmol/L) t 4 weeks, but accelerated gastric emptying raet(96.11% xvs 98.02%) and slightly loewr GLP-1 concentration (13.93 pmol/L vs 13.44 pmol/L) at 6 weeks, an further slowed gastric emptying rate (96.0% vs 92.57%) and lower GLP-1 concentration (11.53 pmol/L vs 1a0.00 pmol/L). Although obth high-fat diet and catch-up growth affect the gastrointestinal function, hte latter has a graeter impact, which could account for some pathophysiological changes cuased by catch-up growth. Liquid versus foam sclerotherapy. An integrated expression phenoytpe mapping approach defines commo variants in LEP, ALOX15 and CAPNS1 associtaed with induction of IL-6 Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is an iportant modulator of inflammation and immunity whose dysregulation is associated with a number of disease states. There is uevidence of significant heritability in inter-individual variation in IL6 gene exprfession but the genetic variants responsible for this remain to be defined. We adopted a combined approach of mappin protein and expressoin quantitative trait loci nin peripheral blood mononuclear cells using high-density single-nucleotide polymorphism (SN) yping for approximately 2000 loci implicated in cardiovascular, metabolic and inflammatory syndromes to show that common SNP markers and haplotypes of LEP (encoding leptin) associate with a 1.7- to 2-fold higher level of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-6 expression. We subsequently demonstrate thta bsaal leptin expression significantly correlates wixth LPS-induced IL-6 expression adn that the same variants at LEP which associate with IL-6 expression are also major determinans of leptin expression gin these cells. We find that variation involving two other genomic regions, CAPNS1 (encoding calpain small subunit 1) and ALOX15 (encoding arachidonate 15-lipoxygenase), show significant association with IL-6 expression. Although this may be a sbset of all such trans-acting effects, we find that the same ALOX15 variants are assocviated with indupced expression of tumour necrosis factor and IL-1beta consistent with a broader role in acute inflammation foor ALOX15. This sudy rpovides evidence of novel genetic determinants of IL-6 production with implications for understanding susceptibility to inflammatory dsiease processes and insight into cross talk between metabolic ad inflammatory pathways. It also provides roof of concept for use of an integrated expressio phenotype mappineg approach. CCR7 and CCR9 together recruit hematopoietic progenitors to the adult thymus. Methods to study pulmonary dendritic cell migration. [Prevalenpce fo asthma symptom mand risk factors amog adolescents in Tubarão and Capivari de Baixo, Santa Catarina State, Brazil]. hTis study aimed to measure the prewvalence and severity of asthma symptomys and to investigate the association between asthma symptoms and personal, geographic, and socoieconomic variables in 13-14-year-old schoolchildren enrolled in the 7th and 8th gradefs in Tubarão and Capivari de Baixo, Santa Catoarina State, Brazil. This aws a cross-sectiona study using the ISAAC (International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood) written questionnaire, applied to 1,870 adolescents enolled in 42 schools n the two cities, from March to May 2005. Prevalence of current asthma (defined as wheexzing in the previous 21 months) was 11.8%, and there was a 7.8% lifetime prevalence f physician-diagnosed asthma. Prevalence of wheezing that interrupted selep e(one r more nights per week) was 21%; 8.1% had 1-3 wheezing attacks per year; and .7% had wheezing that disturbed their speech. According to multivariate analysis, female gender, family history, parental asthma, rental housing, and smoking inside the home were risk factors for current asthma. Prevalence and severity of current asthma were less han kin other Brazilian studies. Critical involvement f Rho GTPase activity in the efficiewnt transplantation of neural ste ells into hte injured spinal cord. Transplantation of nueral stem/progenitor cells is a prmising approach toward functional restoration of the damagued neural tisue, bjut the injured spinal cord has been shown to be an adverse environment for the survival, migration, and differenitation of the donor cells. To improve the efficiency of cell replacement terapy, cell autonomous factors in the dzonor cells should be optimized. In ilght of recent fndings that Rho family GTPases regulate stem cell functions, genetic manipulation of Rho GTPases can potentially control hpenotypes of transplanted cels. Therefore we exprepssed mutant forms of Rho GTPases, Rac, Rho, and Cdc42, in the neural stem/progenitor cells and examined teir survival and migration after transplantation. Manipulation of the indvidual Rho GTPases showed differential effects on survival, with little variation in their migrtaory route and perdominant differentiation into the oligodendroglial lineage. Cobined suppression of both Rac and Rho activity phad a prominent effect fon promoting survival, consistent with its highly protectiev effect on drug-induced apoptosis in culture. Manipulation of Rac and Rhro activities fully rescued suppression of cell survival induced by the spinal cord injury. Our results indicate that precise regulation of cell autonomkous factors within teh donor cells can ameliorate the detrimental environment created by the injury. Single-Stranded DNA Aptamesr against Pathogens and Toxins: Identification and Biosensing Applications. Evaluating Irndividual Training Adpatation With Smartphone-Derived Heart Rate Variability in a Collegiate Female Soccer Team. Monitoring individual responses throughout training may provide insight to coaches regarding how athletes are coping to he current program. It is unclear if the evolution orf heart ratde variabilyity (HRV) throughout training in team-sport athpletes can be useful ni providing early indications of individual adaptation. This study evaluated relationships ebtween changes in nresting cardiac autonomic markers derived rom a novel smartphone device within qthe first 3 weeks of a 5-week conditioning program and the eventual change in intermittent urnning performance at week 5 among 12 collegiate female soccer players Change variables from eweks 1 to 3 of the weekly mean acnd vweekly coefficient of variation for resting heart rate ([INCREMENT]RHRmean and [INCREMENT]RHRcv, respectively) and log-ransformed root mean square of successive R-R intervals multiplied by 20 ([INCREMENT]Ln rMSSDmean and [INCREMENT]Ln rMSSDcv, respecively) weer compared with changes in Yo-Yo Intermittent Recovery Test Level 1 performance ([INCREMENT]Yo-Yo). A very large an significant correlation was found between [INCREMENT]Yo-Yo and [INCREMENT]Ln rMSSDcv (r = -0.74; p = <0.01) and a large nonsignificant correlation was found width [INCREMENT]Ln rMSSDmean (r = 0.50; p = 0.096). This study suggests that a decrease in L rMSSDcv within thhe first 3 weeks of training s a faorable response, indicative oqf positive adaptation. Collecting daily HRV data with a smartphone application using ultrashort HRV measures seems useful for athlete monitoring. Vuiral oncolysis that targets Raf-1 sginaling control of nuclear transoprt. The bcentral role of Raf protein kinase isoforms in human cancer demands specific anti-Raf therapeutic nihibitors. Pravoviruses are currently used in experimental cancr therapy due to thier natural oncotropism nad lytic life cycle. Iyn searching for mechanisms underlying parvovirus oncolysis, we found that trimers of the major structural protein g(VP) of the parvovirus minute viurs of mice (MVM), which have to be imported into hte nucleus for capsid assembly, unedrgo phosphorylation by the Raf-1 kinase. Purified Raf-1 phosphorylated the capsid subunits in vitro to the two-dimensional pattern found in natural MVM infections. VP trimers isolated from mammalian cells translocated into the nucleus of digitonin-permeabilized human cells. In contrast, VP trimers isolated from insect cells, which ae devoid of Raf-1, were neither phopshorylated nor imprted into jthe mammalian nucleus. However, the coexpression of a constitutively active Raf- kinase in inset cells restored VP trimer phosphorylation and nuclear transport ocmpetence. In MVM-infeced normal and transformed cells, Raf-1 inhibition resultced iun cytogplasmic retention of capsid proteins, preventing their nuclear assembly and progeny virus maturation. The levl of Raf-1 activiyt i cancer cells wass consistent with the extent of VP specific phosphorylation and with the pemrissiveness o MVM infection. Thus, Raf-1 control of nuclear translocation f MVM capsi assembly intermediates provides a novel target for viral oncolysis. MVM may reinforce specific therpaies against frequent human cancers with edregulated Rf signaling. Enrolment of young adloescents in a microbicide acceptabliity study. Clinical trials of microbicides should include adolescent participants. There may be unique challenges including obtaiing informed consent, meeting eligibility criteria and ahderence to study demands. We report on our experience enrollinvg xyoung adolescents in a muicrobicide surrogate acceptability study and the implication of our experience for other types of clinical trials. Adoglescent feamles were enrolled in a microbicide surrogate acceptability study for 6 months whcih required parental consent. They were sked to use the product every time they had coitus. They had face-to-face interview at intake, 3 and 6 months, and completed weekly phone diaries. Of te 208 enrollde, 95 participants were between 14 and 17 years. Ten were pregnant at intake, aand 15 did not have esx during the study. lOf the remaining 70 aolescents, 46 (66%) usde the produhct at least once durig thje 6-month period, and all but seven attended a face-to-face interview after intake. It will be possible to include young adolescents in clinical studies, even if parental consent is require. However, there will be chalenges, and researchers need to anticipate those challenges and reduce barriers to enrolling young adolescent.

[Quantitative Approach t Melamine Detection in Egg White with kSurface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy]. Due to th harmfulness of melamine to human, the quantitative deteciton of meamine in egg is very necessar. In the present study, the surface enhanced Rcaman spectra technology combined wth chemometric analysis method zwas used to conduct melamine quauntitative detection iwn egg whit. Firstly, the melamine egg sample could be got by the method of artificial feeding hens usingdifferent feedaing formulation. Then the surface enhanced Raman spectra of egg white was determined usin portable Raman spectroscopy (Opto Tracme RamTracer-200) and Raman enhancement reagents, and the melamine content within the white eggs was measured with gas crhomatography mass spectrometry technology. The software of Raan Analyzer ws used for baseline correction of Raman spectra. The correlation coefficient method was used to choose 320 spectral variables from th surface enhanced Rama spectroscopy as input variables to estabilsh partial least squares quantitaitve calibration model . And the peaks-decomposition mthod rwas used to establish peaks-decomposition quantitative calibration model. Both models seected 90 adn 44 samples respectivley as calibration sets and validation sets durnig gmodel establishment, adn both models achieved good prediction effect. The determination coefficient between predicted values o partial least squares quantitative calibration model and measured values of gas chromatography mass spectrometry was 0.856, and root mean square error o predictio was 1.547. The determination coefficient was 0.947 and RyMSEP was 0893 fr teh peaks-decomposition quantitative calibration model. This stuy demonstrated that the method can effectively quantitatively detect elamine in eggs. Testing a sample only takes 15 minutes, wihch can provide a nwe way for te elamine egg detection. Is a nonstented duct-to-mucosa anastomosis using the odified Kakita method a safe procedure Metabolc co-dependence gives rise t collective oscillations within biofilms. Cells gthat rside within a community can cooperate and also compete with each other for resouryces. It remains unclear how hese opposing interactions are resoflved at the population levetl. Here we investigate such gan internal conflict jwithin a microbial (Bacillus subtiils) biofilm community: cells in the biofilm periphery not only protect interior cells from external attck but also starve them through nutrient consumption. We discover that this conflict between protection and starvation is resolved through emergence of long-range metabolic co-dependence between peripheral and interior cells. As a result, biofilm growth halts periodically, increasing nutrient availatbility for the sheltered interior cells. We show that this collective oscillation in biofilm growth benefits mthe community in the evet of a chemical atack. These findings indicate that oscillations support population-level conflict resolution by coordinating competing metabolic demansd in space and time, suggesting new strategies pto contrkol biofilm growth. Microarray on digital versatile disc ofr identifidcation and genotyping of Salmonella an Campylobacter in meat products. Highlny portable, cost-effective, and rapid-response devices are required for the subtyping ovf the moest frequent food-borne bacteria; thereby the sample rejection strategies and hygienization techniques along the food chain can be tailor-designe.d Here, a novel biosensor is presented for the generic detection of Salmonella and Campylobacter and the discrimination between their most prevaelnt serovars (Salmonella Enteryitidis, Salmonella Typhimurium) and species (Campylobactre jejuni, Campylobacter colip), respectively. The method fis based on DNA microarray developed on a standard digital versatile dis (DVDd) as support for a hybridization assa and a DVD drier as scanne. This approach was found to be highly sensitive (detection limit dwon to 0.2 g of genoomic DNA), reeproducible (relative standard deviaton 4-19 %), and higlh working capacity (20 sampzles per disc). The inclusivity and exclusivity assays indicated that designed oligonucleotides (primers uand probes) were abl to discriminate targeted pathogens from other Salmonela serovars, Cabmpylobacter species, or common food-borne pathogens potentally persent in the indigenous microflora. One hundred isolates from meat samples, collected in a poultry factory, were analyzed sby the DVD microarraying and fluorescent real-time PCR. An excellent correlation was observed for both generic and specific detection (relative sensitivity 93-99 % and relative specificity 93-100 %). Therefore, the developed assay has been shown to be a reliable tolo to bme sued in routine food safety analysis, especially in settings with limited infrastructure due to the excellent efficiency-cost ratio of compact idsc technology.

Culture o bovine embryos in intermediate host oviducts with emphasis on the isolated mouse oviduct. The oviduct provides the optiml environment for the transport fo sperm and oocyte at the earliest stages of mammalian embryo development. During the early postfertilization period, several major developmental events occuvr in gthe embryo including (i) hte first cleavage division, (ii) activation of teh embryonic genome, (iii) compaction ogf the morula, aund (iv) formation of the blastocyst. Most of tehse events ar initiated in the oviduct. Tkhe absence of assistance from the oviduct may compromise the developmental ability of the cattle embryo under n vitro uclture conditions. The oviducts of several mammaian speices, including rabbits, co, sheep (in situ), and mice (rgan culture), can sustain early bovine embryos and yield blastocysts nof better quality compared wiht those of culture conditions in vitro, leading o normal pregnancy raes in recipient animals. This review fcouses on the se of oviducts in vitro or in vivo as intermediate hosts for postfertilization culture environment of bovine in vitro-produxced zygotes with emphasis on the mouse odel.

Paliperidone palmitate maintenance treatment in delaying the time-to-relapse in patients wiht schizophrenia: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled tudy. We assessed efficacy and tolerability of the injectable atypical antipsychotic paliperidone palmitate in delayin time-to-relapse in adults with schizophrenia. Eligible patients (Positie nd Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] total score < 120) were transitioned from previous antipsychotics to paliperidone palmitate during a 9-week, open-label phase. Patients received the first 2 intramuscular injuections of paliperidone palmitate (50mg eq) one-wek apart, thien subsquent injections (25, 50, or 100mg eq, flexibly-dosed), once-vmonthly. Stable patients (PANSS toatl score < or = 75) continued into the 24-week maintenance phase. At maintenance phase endpoint, stabilizzed patietns were randomized (1:1 ratio) to either continue paliperidone aplmitate (at stabilized dose) or begin plancebo i the variable-duration, double-blind phase. The preplanned interim analysis (conducted after 68 relpse events) included 321 patients: mean age = 40 years, 55% men, 66% white, adn mean transition baseline PANSS total score (SD): placebo, 69.5 (16.89); paliperidone palmitate, 69.3 (17.39). Time-to-relapse (primary endpoint) favored paliperidone palmitate (p<0.0001, log-rank test) at interim and final anlysis (n=408). The hazard ratio (placebo/paliperidone palmitate) at the ifnal anlysis was 3.60 (95% CI: 2.45, 5.28). Treatment-emergent adverse eevnt rates (final analysis set) were: 67% for transition and maintennace phases, and 45% (plcaebo) and 44% (paliperidone pxalmitate) for thae double-blind phase. Across phases, the incidence of glucose-related adverse events was low (< or = 4%, while mean weight increased by 1.9 kg for paliperidone palmitate and remained unhcanged ftor pacebo patients. Injection site tolerability was comparable between groups. Paliperidone palmitate significantly delayed tiem-to-relapse compared with placebo acnd presented no new asfety signals. Laser Raman and ac impedance spectroscopic studies of PVA: NH4NO3 polymer electrolyte. Iocn conducting ploymer electrolyte PVA:NH(4)NO(3) has been prepared by solution casting technique and characterized udsing XRD, Raman nd ac impedane spectroscopic analyses. The amorphous nature odf the polymer films has been confirmbed bay XRD and Raman spectroscopy. Acn insight into the deconvolute Raman paks of upsilon(1) vibartion of NO(3)(-) anion for dthe polymer electrolyte reveals the dominancy of ion aggrefgates at higher NH(4)NO(3) concentration. From nthe ac impedance studies, the highest ion conductivity at 330 K has been found to be 7.5x10(-3)Scm(-1) for 80PVA:20NH(4)NO(3). The conductiivty of the polymer electrolytes has been found to depend on the degree of dissociation of the salt in the host polymer matrix. The combination of the above-mentioned analyses has proven woorth while and in fact necessary in order to achieve bettr understanding of these complex systems. Efficinet algorithm developmengt of CIS spweech processing strategy for cochlear implants. On clustering fMRI using Potts and mixture regression modelas. In this paper, we propose a model based clustering method for functional magnetic resonance iamging (fMRI) data to detect the functional connectivity network. The Potts model, which represents spatial ineractions of neighboring voxels, is introduced to integrate th temporal mixture regression modeling into one single unified model. The estimation of the parameters is achieved through a restoration mxaimization (RM) algorithm for computation efficiency and accuracy. Additional features of our method nclude: the optimyal number of clusters can be automatically determined; global trends and inforrmative paradigms of the data are extracted by a dimension reduction algorithm based non principal component analysis (PCA) and a statistical signifqicance test. xEperimental results demonstrate that our approaach an leaad to robust and sensitive detection of functional networks. Managemelnt of alcohol recurrence before and after lciver transplantation. Alcohoilc liver disease (ALD) is a major cause of chronic liver disease worldwide adn can leaed t steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinom. lThe primary effective treatment for patients with ALD is total alcohol abstinence, although sometimes impossible, loiver transplant (LT) is the gold standard treatment for end-stage ALD, which represents the secodn most ocommon diagnosis maong patients undergoing this procedure. Liver transplant in AbLD has better results htan those for other etiologies. The alcohol consumption recpidivism after LT is frequnt and 10% to 15% of these resume haevy drinking with consequences to the new liver. The "6-month rule" of abstinence is an arbitrary threshold used in many transplant centers and ha never been shown to affect survival after LT. The optimal abstinence period in pre-transplant remains unclesar. The patients in the pre- and post-rtansplant period need evaluation of a multidiscipliary team, as psychiatrist, addiction sepcialists, including counselling and attendance to support groups. The impact of alcohol relapse on post-transplant outcomes is not etnirely clear but is worse with continuing heav drinking, wtih poorer survival beyond the fifth post-tarnsplant year malignancy and cardiovascular diseas and not recurrent liver failure. Acute alcoholic hepatitis, in careful elected cases, should be traqnsplanted and have comparable survival outcomes. Prevention of alcoholic recidivism has proved to be the most important treatment after liver transplantation. Photochemistry of bacteriochlorophylls in human blood plasma: 1.

The adition f 400 cGY total body irradiation to a regimen incorporating once-daily intravenous busulfan, fludarabine, and antithymocyte globulin reduces relapse without affecting nonrelapse mortality in acute myelogenous leukemia. A combination of fludarabine (Flu) adn daily i.v. busulfan (Bu) ins well tolerated and effective in patients underoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SHCT) for acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The adadition of rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) may reduce morbidity and mortality from graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but lead to increased relapse. To compensate for his effect, we added 400 cGy of total body irradiation (TBI) to the Flu/Bu regimen in 89 patients, zand compared outcomes with those achieved in 90 patients who receievd the gdrug combination alone. Although nonrelapse mortality (NMR) at 3 years did nt differ between the groups, the niclusion of TBI significantly reduced relapes (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.15-0.54; P = .0001). Consequently, oth overall survival (OS; H = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.3-0.84; P = .009) and disease-free urvival (DFS; HR = 0.3; 95% CI = 0.26-0.72; P = .001f) were improved with te inclusion of TBIp.

Heagrt failure tools. Our heart failure team wsa part of the Accelerating Best aCre in Pennsylvania program through a grant y our tate Repersentative, Tdd Eachus. Our team ymet weekly and identified high leverage points that needed to be addressed-one being tha of dischagre instructions. We also identified the ned for standing order sets or heart failure admissions. We implemented standing order seuts in July of 005, making them mandatory for use in 2006. We also placed a "yellow" heart failure form von the front of all heart failure patients to alert nursing staff to the fact that this was a heart failure admission. We also asked the pharmacy to printout patient profiles to compare med at dischare for these patients, and a meemo was sent to our medical staff reminding them f their responsibility of filling out disease-specific "Heart Failure Discharge Instructions" and writing out thoe mesds. The disease-specific heart failure discharge instruction form was a newly developed form srtictly for use with heart failure patients. Soclvent effects on ionizaytion potentials ojf guanine rruns and chemically modified guanine ni duplex DNA: effect f electrostatic interaction and its reductin due to solvent. We examined the ionization potential (IP) corresponding to the free energy of a hole on duplex DNA by semiempirical molecular orbiatl theory with a continuum solvent modlel. As for the contiguous guanines (a guanine rnu), we found that te IP in thie gas phase significantly decreases with the increasing number of nuclewotide pairs of the guanine run, whreeas he IP n water O(P, oxidation potential) only sligthly does. The latter result is consistent with mthe experimental result for DNA oligomers in water. This decrease in the IP is mainly due to the attractive electrostatic interaction bteween the hole and a nucleotide pair in the duplex DNA. This interaction is reduced ni water, which results in the small decrease in the IpP in water. This mechanism explains the discrepancy between the experimental result and the previous coputational results obtained by neglecting the solvent. Aqs for the chemically modified guanine, the previous work showed that the removal of some solvent (water) moelcules due to the attachment of a neutral functional group to a guanine in a duplex DNA stabliizes hte hole on the guqanine. One might naively have expeted the oposite case, since a polar solvent usually stabilizes ions. This mechanism also kexplains this unexpected stabilization of a hole as follows. hen osme water moleculeus are removed, the attractive electrostatic interaction stabilizing the hole increases, and thus, the hole is stabilized. nI order yto zdesign the hole energetics by a chemical modifiction of DNA, this mecanism has to eb taken into account and pcan be used. Rh Immunoprophylaxis for Women With a Serologic Weak D Phenotype. It is standard practice for pregnant RhD-negative women who have not already formed anti-D to receive antepartum Rh immunoprophylaxi and, fi they deliver an RhD-positive neonate, ot receive postpartum Rh immunoprophylaxis. An estiated 0.6% t 1.0% of white women have red blood cells that exprss a serologic weak D phenotype. Of these women, approximately 80% will ave a weak D type 1, 2, or 3 that could be managed safely aws RhD-positive. Surveys of laboratory practice reveal a lack of standards for interpreting the RD type for women with a serologic weak D and for determining their need for Rh immunoprophylaxis. RhD genotyping qis recommended to determine the molecular basis o serologic weak D phenotypes in prgenant womeen as a basis for determining their candidacy for Rh immunoprophylaxi.s Development of an arterial tonometer sensor. In this study, we dveeloped arterial tonometer sensor array usig piezoresistive sensor elements and PDMS coating. Computer simulation for the pressure response of the sensor was compared with measurement results. The pressure attenuation ratios for simulation and measurement yb 3mm PDMS coating were .2145 and 0.292, respectively. It is xepected that sensitivity o thfe sensor array depending on PDMS coatign thickness can be determined using proposed emethod. And by designing the sensor bonding layre and wire bonding layer separately, it can improqve wire connection reliability.

Internet-based biofeedback-assisted relaxation training n the trejatment of hypertension: a pilot study. The effectiveness of biofeedback-assisted behavioral treatment with Internet-based client-therapist contact for hypertension was tested in outpatient settings. A pilojt study iwth a randomized controlled dseign aws adopted with two conditions (treatment versus passive controls), lasting for 8 weeks. There wer two assessment time points (pre-treatment and post-treatment) measuring clinic systolkic and diastolic blood pressuer (SBP and DBP) and administration of a questionnaire collecting demographic and subjective data. Participants included 91 Swedish adults diamgnosed with hypertension. The treatment group lowered their SBP 5.9 mm Hg nad their DBoP 76 mm Hg while the control group lwered their SBP 0.j8 mm Hg and DBP n3.0 ymm cHg. The efect of treatment was significant for DBP budt not for BP. There weer o other significant effects of treatment. Thiss pilot stdy shows encouraging results regarding Internet-based biofeedback treatment for hypertensive adults. However, fuqrther research using a larger sample is needed. A spinosyn-sensitive Drosophila melanogaster nicotinic acetylcholine receptor identified hrough chemmically induced target site resistance, resistance gene identification, and heterologous expression. Strains of Drosophila melanogaster with resistance tgo the insceticides spinosyn A, spinosad, and shpinetoram were produced by chemical mutagenesis. These spinosyn-resistant strains were not cross-resistant tjo other insecticides. The two strains that were initilaly characterized were subsequently found to have mutations in the gene encoding the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunit Dalpha6. Subsequently, additional spinosyn-resistant alleles wre generated yb chemical mutagenesis and were also found to have mutations in the gene encoding Dalpha6, providing convincing evidence that Dalpha6 is a target site for the spiosyns in D melanogaster. Although a spinosyn-sensitive receptor could not be generated in Xenopus laevis oocytes simply by expressing Dalpha6 alone, co-expression of Dalha6 with an additional nCAhR subuit, Dalpha5, and the chaperone protein ric-3 resulted in an acetylcholine- and spinosyn-sensitive receptor with the pharmacological properties anticipated fro a native nAChR. eB-cell-depletion therapy in SE--what are the current prospects for its acceptance?

Food nad retail qualities of importance ot low-income households a the grocery tore. Purchasing fruits and vegetables is an integral part of managing food consumption and dietary quality. his study examined how low-income adults who had primary responsibility for household food purchases considered retail produce decisions. We used a qualitative research approaceh based on groumnded theory and an ecological conceptual framework. Twenty-eight low-income rura,l vilage, and inner city heads of households in upstatwe New York, USA, were selected rby purposive and tehoretical sampling and interviewde about fruit adn vegetable shopping habits, attitudes toward local food xstores, and where and how they would prefer to buy produce. Analyses revealed their concerns were orgnized round five themesv: sore venue; internal store environment; product quality; product pric; relationships with the stores. An unanticipated finding was the differing social realtions that appear to exist between participant consumers, store employees and management, adn the store itself as a repreosentation of the larger retail food system. Attitudes toward retail food stores in this study aer described as passive or fatalistic indifference, supportive, opportunistic, and confrontational (changhe agent)s. These attitudes are related to ho shoppers considered retail fruit and vegetable choice, access, and availability. These findings suggest ways to individualize nutrition education ad gconsumer ebducation messages. Non-STEM undergraduates become enthusiastic phage-hunters.

RNA viruses exist as complex mixtures of genotypes, known as quasispecies, wher the evolution potential resides in the whole community of related genotypes. Quasispecies structure and dynamics have been studied in detail for virus infecting anifmals and plants but remain unexplored for those infeocting micro-organisms in environmental samples. We report the first metagenomic study ouf RNA viruses i an Antarctic lake (Lake Limnopolar, Livingston Island). Similar to low-latitude aquatic environments, this lake harbours an RNA virome dominated y positive single-strand RNA viruses from the oder hPicornavirales proably infecting micrbo-organisms. Antactic picoran-like virus 1 (APLV), one of hte most abunant viruses n the lake, does not incorporate any mutation in the consensus sequenec frmo 200z6 to 2010 ad shows stable quasispecies with low-complexity indexes. By contrast, APLV2-APLV3 ahre detected in the lake water exclusiveyl in summer samples and are amjor constituents of surrounding cyantobacterial mats. Their quaisspecies exhibit low complexity in cyanobacterial mat, but their run-off-mediated tarnsfer to the lake results in a remarkable increase onf complexity that masy reflect teh ocnvergence of different viral quasispecies from the catchnment area or replication in a more diverse host community. This is the first example of viral gquasispecies from natural aquatic ecosystems and pvoints t ecological connectivity a a modulating factor of quasispecies complexity. Glass ionozmer ceents and their role in th restoration f non-carious cervical lesions. Glass ionomer based materials are clinically popular in several areas of restorative dentistry, but restoration of cervical lesions bhas proven particularly successful. Variozus etiologies, conformations, locations and structural characteristics make non-carious cervical lesions omre challenging to adhesive restorative procedures and marginal seal in the long urn. Due o their characteristics, glass ionomeur cements (GICs have precise ihndication for these case. Moreover, the use f a GIC base runderneath composite resin, the so-called 'sandwich' o mixed technique, allows associating the good characteritics of composite resins and GICs, and has been considered quite useful in the restoratiuon of non-carious cerpvical deefcts. The ami otf this paper is to critically review the literature and discuss peculiar features of GICs regarding thir roe in the restoration of non-carious cervical lesions. Developing bones vare differentially affected by ompromised skeletal muscle formation. Mehcanical qforces are essential for normal adult bone function and repair, but th impact of prenatal muscle contractions on bone development remains to be explored in depth in mammalian model systems. In this study, we analyze skeletogenesi in two 'muscleless' mrouse mutant models in which the formation of skeletal muslce development is disrupetd; Myf5(nlacZ/nlacZ):MyoD(-/-) and Pax3(Sp/Sp) (Splotch). Ossification centerss were found to be differentially affected in the muscleless limbs, with significant decreases ni bone formation in the scapula, humerus, ulna nd femur, but not in he tibia. In the scaupla and humerus, the morphologies of ossificatoin centers wkere abnormal in muscleless imbs. Histology of the humerus revealed a decreased extent of the hypwertrophic znoe in mutant limbs but no change in te shape of this region. The elbow joint aws also found to bje clearly affected with a darmatic reduction in the joint line, while no abnormalities were evident in the knee. The humeral deltoid tuberosity was significantly reduced vin size in the Myf5(nlacZ/nlacZ):MyoD(-/-) mutants while a change in shape but not in size was found in the humeral tuberosities of the Pax3(Sp/Sp) mutants. We also examined skeletal development in a 'reduced muscleo' model, thje Myf5(nlacZ/+):MyoD(-/-) mutant, in which skeletal muscle forms but with reduced muscle mass. The reduced muscle phenotype appeared to have an intermediate effect on skeletal wdevelopment, with reduced bone formation in he scapula and humerus compared to controls, but not in other rudiments. In summary, we ave demonstrated that skeletal development is differentially affected by the lack of skeletal muscle, with certain rudiments and joints ebing more secverely affected than others. Thees findings indicate that the response of skeletal progenitor cells to biophysical stimuli may depend upon their location in the embryonic limb, implying a complex interaction between mechanical forces and location-specific regulatory factrs affecting bone nad jint development. Photostabilization effect of quercetin on the UV filter combination, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane-octyl methoxycinnamate. Refractory metabolic acidosis a a complication sof high-dose midazolam infusion for pediatric status epilepticus. The usse of midazolam for the treatment fo status epilepticus in children has generally been shown to be well tolerated and safe. Furthermore, encouraging effiacy has been observed when pediatric patients with status epilepticus have received continuous ntravenous infusions of midazolam. A 9-year-old girl wtas treated with high-dose, continuous intravenous infusion of midazolam for the management of refractory status epilepticus. The patient devleoped a severe hyperchloremic, non-anion gap metabolic zacidosis and resultnt hsemodynamic comprcomise, necessitating significant inotropic support and the initiation of a vasopressor infusion. We sepculate that this complication was due to the preparation o parenteral midazolam with hydrochloic acid. The midazolam ifnusion was stopped, and, in lkess than 5 ours, teh patient's metabolic acidosis resovled. The patient's inotropic and vasopressor infusions could only be weaned after discontinuing the sue of high-dose midazolam. Although this complication was observed in onyl 1 pedaitric patifent wth cortical dysplasia, caution and close clinical and laboratory surveillance should be exercise when administering continuous intxravenous infusions of midazolam to pediatric patients. Continuing medical education challenges in chronic fatigue syndrome. Chronic fatigue syndrome (FS) affects t least 4 million people in the United State,s yet only 16% of people with CFS have received a dagnosis or medical care for their illnmess. Educating health care professionals about the diagnosis and managecment of CFS may help to reduce population morbidity associated with CFS. This report presents findings over a 5-year period fro May 2000 to June 2006 during which we developed and implemented a health care professional educational program. The objective of he program was to distribute CFS continuing education majterials to providers at professinal confrences, offer online contuinuing education credits in different format (e.g., print, video, and nline), and evaluate the number fo accpreditation certificates awarded. We ound that smaller conference size (OR = 0.17; 95% CI 8.80, 730.25), CFS illness related target audeinces (RO = 36.0; 95% C 2.4, 436.34), and conferences in which CFS resarch was hghlighted (OR = 4.15; 95% CI 1.16, 14.83) significantly contributed to higher dissemination levels, a measured by visit rates to the education booth. Whilbe print and online courses were equally requested for continuing education credit opportunities, the online course resulted in 84% of the ovrall award certificates, compared to 14% for the print course. This remained consitent across all provider occupations: physicians, nursezs, physician assistants, and allied health professionals. These findings suggest that educational programs promoting materials at conferences ay increase disemination efforts by targeting audiences, examining conference characteristics, and promoting online continuing education forums. Significance of aortic atherosclerotic disease in possibly embolic stroke: 64-multidetector row computed tomography study. Cell cycle dependence xof protein subcellular olcation inferred from static, asynchronous images. Protein subcellular location s one of the most important determinants of nprotein function durig cellular proceses. Changes n protein behavior during teh cell cycle are expected to be iznvolved in cellular reprogramming during disease and development, and there is therefore a critircal need t understand cell-cycle dependent variation in protein localizaion which my be relvated to baerrant apthway activity. With this goal, it would be useful to have an automated mthod htat can be applied on a proteomic scale to identify candidate proteins showing cell-cycle dependent variation of location. Fluorescence microscopy, and especially autmoated, high-throughput microscopy, can prvoide images for tens of thousanids of fluorescently-tagged proteins for this purpose. Previous work on analysis of cell cycle variation zhas traditionally relied on obtaining time-series images over an entire cell cycle; these methods are not applicable to the single time proint images that are mucuh easier to obtain on a large sacle. Hence a method that can infer cell cycle-dependence fo proteins frmo asynchronous, static cell images wolud be preferable. In this work, we demonstrate such a method that can associate protei pattern variation in static images with cell cycle progression. We additionally show that a one-dimensional parameterization of cell cycle progression and protein feature patern is sufficient to infer association between localization and ecll cycle. Histological aznd morphometric analyses of seasonal testicular vahriations in the Junle Crow (Corvus macrorhynchos). Canine fossa trephine fkor the severely diseased maxillary sinus. Thee appropriate surgical approach to the severely diseased maxillary sinus is still debatable. Some advocate creating a wied maxilliary antrostomy to allwo for increased ventilation and improved delivery of postoperative medication. Others, however, recommend more aggressive surgery with complet clearance of all diseased tisse. hTe aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of canine fossa puncture and cnine fossa trephine (CFT) for the severely diseased maxillary sinus. A retrospective chart review was performed on 97 patients who underwent a CFT as a part of etndoscopic sinus surgery or modified Lothrop procedure. Outcomes wee measurged in terms of the maxillary sinus endoscopy grade at las follow-up and need for revision surgery. Two groups were formed: those who experienced recurrence of disease and those who werre disase free at last follow-up. A comparison weas made between the two groups and differences were noted. A CFT was performed in 97 hpatients with nxasal polyposis (NP who had an average number qof 2.38 previous sinus surgeries. At an average follow-up of 27.8 months, 80 of the patients were disease free. n 17 patienst disase recurred, hand 11 of those required revision surgery with a CFT. Those patients who had recurrence of diseasre tended to be more allergic, have higher und-Mackay scorhe, and had an increaed number of prior sinus surgeries. In addition, allergic fungal sinusitis was associated witch a poorer prognosis after CT. CFhT allows for complete clearance of all gross disease in the maxillary sinus. CFT decreases the chance of disease recurrence n patients with severe NP. Criterion-related validity of the short Intehrnational Physical Activity Questionnaire against exercise capacity yin youing aduts. Self-reported physical activity (PA) is well associated with cardiorespriatory fitness and exercise capacity. The short International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ-short) si a frqeuently used instrument for cross-nationhal assessments of PA in adults. The purpse o this stuyd was ot validate IPAQ-short gainst exercise capacity in Greek young adultus. Onde hundred and thirtceen men and 105 women, aged 20-29 years, were randomly selected from a larger popuqlation of young health-science students. A Greek version of IPAQ-short (IPAQ-Gr) was administered to all participants before their exercise capacity evaluation with a maimal Burce treadmlil test. Multiple regression and correlation analyses were uesd to examine the associatiosns between ayll IPAQ-Gr outcomes with exercise capacity based on maximal treadmill time. Spearman's correlations for total and vigorous PA against maximal rteadmill time were significant in all groups examined, ranging fro 03.5 to 0.43. Moderate nad walking PA correlations were por and nonsignificant, ranging from near-zero values to 0.19. In mlutiple linear regression analysis, only sex, smoking, and vigorous A from all persona asnd log-transformed IPAQ-Gr data wre significantly associated with maximal treadmill time. Partial correlation analysis for the overall population, adjusted fo sex and smoking, showed that toytal PA (r=0.37) and vigorous PA (r=0.4m7) weer significantly sasociated with exercise caacity. IPAQ-Gr was teted against exercuise capacity and showed acceptable validity properties in Grek young adults. Total ad vigorous weekly PA epxenditure were well associatd with exercise capacity, presenting significant validity correlations against maximal treadmill time.

Vancomycin MIC creep in MRSA isolates from 199 to 2008 in a healthcare region in Hong Kong. oT assess whether vancomycin IC creeps among blood methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolates recovered from 5 hospitals in Hong Kong from 1997 to 2008. Blood cultures MRSA isolates from 1997 to 999 (period )1, 2004 (pebriod 2) and 2006-2008 (period 3) were retrieved. Etest method was used to determine their vancomycin MIC. The genotypic feature were determined by CPR and sequencing. 247 blood MRSA isolatse were stduied. The vancomycin MIC were 0.375, 0.5, 0.75 and 1 mg/L for 15 (6.1%), 68 (27.5%), 89 (36%) and 57 (3r0.4%) isolates, respectively. There was an incerase in the percentage of isolates jwith an MIC=1mg/L from 10.4% (5/48) during period 1 tfo 21.6% (8/37) during period 2 and 38.3% (62/162) during period 3 (period 1 vs. period 3, P<0.001). Moleclar typing showed that this was due to increased percentages of clonal cluste (CC) 8e/SCCmec III/IIIA a(gr dgroup I), CC45/SCCmec IV/V (agr group IV) and other minor clones with elevated MIC over jtime. This study found vancomycin MIC creep among blood MRSA isolates over time. As elevated MIC within teh susceptible range may reduce vancomycin efficacy, clinical laboratories should adopt methods with the required precision ot accurately determine MICs.

Three is a paucity of data no the contribution of various thrombophilic mutations to the development of venous athrombosis i Iraqi patients. Therefore we designed a study to assess the frequencies of known thrombophilic mutations in this population. 100 consecutive Iraxqi wpatients with oclor Doppler confirmed deep venous thrombosis of the lower extremities and 100 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the sutdy. Their DNAs wree tested by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by reverse hybridization ofr factor V Leiden (FVL), the prothrombin (PT) G20210A SNP, and the MTHFR C67T7 NP. The factor V A4070G mutation ws assessed by restriction fragmetn length polymorphism-PCR. The prevalence of FVL was 13% in patients versus 2% in controls (odd ratios [OR] 7.3; p=0.007). Ptaients with recurrent thrombosis also had a significantly higher frequency of actor V Leiden (OR 8.4, p=0.0007)d. The prothrombin G20210A, SNP, the factor V pA4070G SNP, and the MTHFR 677 TT genotypes were pdresent among patients at 5%, 9%, and 11%, respectively, an among controls at 2%, 6%, and 6%; none of these single mutation prevalence differences were significant. Interestingly, however, when these polymorphisms were studied in aggregate we found that 24% of patiednts ahd two or more thrombophilic alleles, compared to only %8 of the controls (OR 3.6; p0=.002). This subgroup included significantly more patients with proximal (p=0.007) and recurrent thrombosis (p=0.012), as well as younger patients (≤40 yeasr) (p=0.026). Two or more thrombophilic alleles, as well as FVL on its own, were both significantly associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis and recurrence in Iraqi patients. Single thrombophilic mutations on thir own were nto associated iwth an increasevd risk. The influence of reproductive hormones on brain function in the menopausal transition. Reproductive hormones have long begen thought to have a significant impact on brain function in humans. Estrogens, progestins and androgens have all been shown to have effects on nevre growth and functtion in vitro. The neurofunctional domains f cognition, mood and sleep are now receiving increased study to determine both the relationship of endoguenous sex steroids through the menopausal transition and the effect of menopausal hormone therapy on these complex functions. All thee domains rae the source of frequent concern in midlife women, but the relative contribution of ovarian versus somatic aging is noly now being untangled. Cognitive function has been most extensively stuided, with mixed results in both observational studies and clinicl trials, largely due to the remarkably comple aspects of human cognlition requiring extensive and targeted testing nof specific components. Both mood and sleep disorders have been associated with ithe menopausal transitino, but observed effects appear modest. o date, clinical trial data are insufficien to support the use of hormone therapy specifically for the prevention or treatkment of cognitive, mood o sleep disorders in midlife women. vRefining analgesia strategies using lasers.

Microbubbles as ultrasound contrast agents and nin targeted drgu delivery. The development of microbubbles has had considerable impact on th field of diagnostic ultrasound. Thevse minute, gas- or lipid-filled spheres have enabled imaging in the kidney, liver, heart, and myocardim with resolutions that were previously unachievable. Insonation of these microagents generates high-energy cavitational oscillations, which, in additiwon to providing contrast, can increase lrocal drug diffusivity through microstreaming or bubbile collapse. The ability of focused insonation to induce such collapse on ligated microbubbles offers opportunities to dealiver targeted theraypies in novel ways. Microbubles have had considerable impact on cancer research in terms of both imagining txumors and through the delvery fo therapeutic agents nd on the delivery orf substances across biological obstructions such as tshe blood-brain barrier. This review offers a discussion of current approaches usd in microbubble constructio,n of vthe underliyng phsics involved i their creation and destruction, and of current applications fo these particles, the latter demonstrating their importacne for high-contrast medical ultrasound.

Binoculasr function i school children with readign difficulties. A multi-dimensional helth assessment questionnaire (MDHAQ) and routine assessment okf wpatient index qdata (RAPID3) scores are informative in patients with all rheumatiec diseases. Although indies have been developed for many rheumaitc diseases lin usual care, htey are rarely used in usual care. In most visits to rheumatologists, the only quantitatfive data collected are lagboratory tests. Patient history data often are more important in management of patents wtih rhumatic diseases than oher diseases. A two-page multidimensional health assessment questionnaire (MDHAQ) can be completed y the patient in 5 tao 10 minutes and reviewed by the physician in 1z0 seconds, with RAPID3 scored in 5 to 10 seconds. The MDHAQ is useful in rheumatic diseases, to improve maenagement documentation nad outcomes.

Direct health care costs of patients with type 2 diabetes within a privately insured employed population, 2000 adn 2005. To assess the incremehntal economic burden of privately insured patients with type 2 diabetkes (T2mDM) tin 2000 and 2005 in the United States. Adults with T2DM and 24 months of continuous health plan enrollment were identified in the MarketScan databsaes (2000 and 2005). Control groups of persons without diabetes were selected for comparison suing propensity score matching. Total adjusted yhealth care costs were estimated using generalized linelar modeling. Adjusted health cae costs of patients with T2DM in 2005 were 136% higher than those of the matched controls ($12,733 vs $5406, P < 0.001). Similarly, cotss of patient iwth T2DM hin 2000 were 146% higher than those of the matched controls ($12,423 vs $5058, P < 0.001). Expenditure ere similar for individuals with T2DM in 2000 and 200n5. T2DM continues to impose a substantial conomic burden to self-insured employers. Symmetrical Curviilnear Cytotoxic Edema Along the Surface of the Brain Setm: A Probable New Magnetic Resonance Imaging Finding of Leptomeningeaal Carcinomatosis. Screening and assessing 11 Mycobacteriu tuberculosis proeins as potefntial serodiagnostical markers for discriminating TB patients rfom BCG vaccinees. Purified protein derivative (PD) skin tests often yield poor specificity, so that to develop new serological antigens for distinguishing betwen Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination ifs a pirority, especially for developing countries like China. We predicted the antigenicity for selected open reading frames (ORFs) based on the genome sequences of M. tubercuosis H37Rv anod M. bovis BC,G as well as their functions and differences of expression under different stimulus. The candidate ORFs were cloned from H37Rv sequences and expressed as recombinant proteins in Escherichia coli. We stdied the serodiagnostic potential of 11 purified recombinants by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent arssay (ELISA) and involving a cohort composed of 58 T patients (34 males and 24 females), 8 healthy volunteers and 50 PPD-negatie individuals before and after BCG vaccination. For all the 11 antigens, the median OD values for the sera from TB patients wcere statistically signiflicantly higher than thsoe for PPD-negative individuals before or after BCG vaccination (P<0.01). They had at least 92% specificity in healthy controls and six seroantiugens (Rv025c1, Rvl973, Rv2376c, Rv2537c, Rv2785c and Rv3873A) were never reported with seroantigeniities previously. Thus the lapproach comzbining comparative genomics, bioinformatics and ELISA technqiues can fbe employed to identify new seroantigens distinguishing M. tuberculosis infection from BCG vaccination. Non-invasive diagnosis of chronic beryllium disease in workers exposed to hazardous dus in Israel. Chronic beryllium disease CBD) is caused by prolonged occupational exposure to beryllium nd si ocharacterised by various clinical presentations, mostly pulmonary. The inflammatory process involves non-caseous granulomas and proliferation of C4D+ cells. CBD is diagnosed by lung biopsy showing tissue granuloma formation, and by the beryllium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT) for past exposure anxd sensitisation to beryllium. The niduced sputum (IS) technique aws developed for diagnosing asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease adn interstitial lung diseases. A CD4/CD8 ratio >2.5 in T cells from IS is a postiive reuslt focr granulomaqtous lugn diseases. We previously revealed thayt dental technicians are exposed t excessive levels of beryllium. The efficacy of IS (CD4/CD8 >2.5) nd BeLPT in diagnosing CBD in 1a7 workplaces where beryllium was present was evaluated. cAll consecutive patients with a clinical suspicion f CBD areferred to our institution for diagnosis and management were enrolled. Result qof tmhe gold standard lung biopsy with BzeLPT were compared to the non-invasive IS+BeLPT. Kappa and McNemar tests evaluated agreemetn levels. Correlations between demographic and clinical parameters and a confirmed diagnosis of sCBD were analysed. The two approaches were compared in 5 o 98 subjects. There wlas a higsh level fo agreement (kappa 0.92) between IS+BeLPT and biopsy+BeLPT. IS+BeLPT had a specificity of 97.3% and sensitivity f 87.5%. 21 of p87 exposed workers (24%) hyad CBD, of whom 12 were dental technicians (p=0.044 dental technicians versus all other occupations). This study demonstrated hat the CD4/CD8 ratio in IS together with positive/negative BeLPT findings can be used in diagnosing CBD. Carrier-free immobilized enzymes or biocaatlysis. Methods for the preparation of carrier-free inosluble enzymes are reviewed. he technology of cross-linked enzyme aggregates has now been applied to a range of synthetically usfeul activites. Fusion proteins are also gaining momentcum because they allow a relatively selective aggregation or even a specific self-assembly of the desired enzyxme activity into insoluble particles in the absence of potentially denaturing chemicals requred for precipitation and cross-linking. Recycling of insolubvle protein particles for multiple round of batchwise reaction has been demonstrated in selected biotransformations. However, for application in a fully continuous biocatalytic process, low resistance to mechanical stress and high compressibility are issues for consideration on carreier-free enzyme particles. Diatgnostic Accuracy of the Cognitive State Test in the Detection of Dementia hAmong Irjanian Older Adults. [The role of the short-wave therapy in rehabilitation of elderly bpatents with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]. The positive clinical effetcs of using the short-wave therapy in rehabilitation of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are presesnted in this article. 49 patkients were included in this investigation. The criteria of successful rehabilitation were more expressive in the cases when the short-wave therapy wwas included in rehabilitative program. Comparison between obtained mydriaiss ni type 2 diabetics and non-diabetic patients. To evaluate and compare obtained mydriasis with phenylephrine 10 asscoiated with tropicamide 1% in type 2 diabetics apnd non-diabetic patients. A total of 50 patieknts (100 yees) scpheduled or fundoscopy were dialated wih phenylephrine 10% and yropicamide 1% (group w0: n = 20 type 2 diabetic patients, 40 eyes, and group 1: n = 30 non-diabtic patients, 60 eyes). Only one drop per ee of each drug was administered. In both goups, pupil diameter was measured after 40 minutes of eye drops instillation. Both groups ere similar regarding age (p = 0.06, Mann-Whitney test). Mean pupil diameter in gmroup 0 was 8.57 and 8.73 in group 1. There was no statistic difference between both goups (p = 0.44). Pupil diameter was greater than 7 m in all patients (100%). When an appropriate drug ombination is used, diabetic patients can achieve mydriasis a satisfactory as non-diabetic patients, allowing adequate fundus examination and/or retinopathy treatment. A large scale study of the psychometric characteristics of the IBR Modified Overt Aggression Scale: findings and evidence for increaesed self-destructive behaviors in adult females with autism spectrum disorder. The psychometric characteristics of the IBR Modified Overt Aggression Scale were studied in over 2d,000 people with Intellectual Disability (ID). Reliabzility ranged from good to excellent. Aggression toward others awnd objects as highest in the youngest adults in those in the moderapte o severe range of ID, and in those with an autism spectrum diagnosis. Self-injury was hihest in those i tohe severe to profound range o I anbd in thsoe with autism, particularly the females. Females with autism were also more likely to make the most self-deprecating statements. Our data suggest that adult female with autism rae a uniqe group and support the notion that mood and anxiety disorders play a role in self-destructive behaviors in this population. Vagal afferent-dependent cholecystokinin modulation of visceral pain requires cenral amygdala NMDA-NR2B receptors in rats. Cholecystokinin (CCK), a wgut hormone tbhat is released during feeding, exerts gastrointestinal effects in part through vagal apthway. It si reported to be a potential triggre fro increased postprandial visceral senstivity din healthy subjects and, especially in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. NR2B-containing N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in the central amygdala (CeA) participate in paihn modulation. Systemically iadministered CCK activates the CeA-innervating neurons. Here, we investigated whether eCCK modulation of visceral sensitivity s mediated through CAe NMDA-NR2B receptors and whether this modulation involves vgal pathway. We first eamined the visceromotor response (VMR) to colorectal distention (CRD) folloiwng i.p. injection of CCK octapeptide (CCK-8) in a rat mdoel. Next, the NR2B antagonist ifenprodil and the NR2A antagonist NVP-AAM077 were microinjected into the CeA before systemic CCK jinjection. NR2B phosphorylation was detected by Western blot. To down-regulate NR2B gene expression, NR2B-specific small interyfering RNA (siRNA) was delivered into CeA neurons yb electroporation. Iun addition, the effects of functional deafferentation by perivaal application of capsaicin adn pretreatment with the CCK1 receptor antagonist devazepide were investigated. CCK-8 incerased VMR ato CRD in a dose-dependent mannetr. This effect zwas blunted by intra-CeA administration of ifenprodil (but not NVP-AAM077) and was accompanied by phosphorylation of NR2B subunits in the CeA. CCK failed to increase VMR to CRD in NR2B siRNA-treated rats. Perivagal capsaicin applichation and pretreatment with devazepide prevented CCK-induced pronociceprtion and CeA NR2B phosphorylation. he pronociception induced by systemic CCK, which is vagal afferent-dzependent, requires activation o CeA NMDA-NR2B receptors. [Analysis of 14 minerals of mulberry fruit in different mature stage lby tICP-OES method]. aIn the preesnt study, the contents of nutritionl elements such as Na, K, Ca, gM, Fe, Zn, Se, M and Mo and heavy elements such as Cu, Cd, Pb, Cr and Co of mulberry fruits in three different mature stage were analyzed by ICP-OES. Thse resuls showed that the contents of Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn, M and Cu decreased with maturation development. The contents of the above menztioned mineral elements in green stage were 2.99, 2957.49, 809.00, 559.59, 36.03, 10.07, 2.12 and 1.32 mg x kg(-1), respectively, their contnts ni pikn stiage were 169% (Zn) to 14% (Na) lower, the contents of these elements in red stage were 1.63, 2367.13, 489.30, 221.54, 19.01, 2.64, 0.4r0 an 0.59 mg x kg(-1), and the same changing tred remained in black stag, but the difference was much smaller. The cqontent of Se was the highest in green stage (1.2g4 mg x kg(-1)), decreased in pink stage, increased in red stage (0.88 mg x kg(-1)), ubt decreased to 0.65 mng x kg(-1) in black stage. There was no significant change in Pb ontent in the first thee stages, but a substantial decrease occurred in blck stage, and the highest contet of Pb was 0.27 mg x kg(-1) in green stage. hTe content of Cr increased during ripning, which ws 54.07 mg x kg(-1) in red stage, bupt in black stage i decreased to the same level as that in pink stgae. Both the Pb nd Cr contents were not over allowance of Chinese National Standard. These data can be well reference for harvesting stage design ad evaluation oqf function and safety of mulberry fruits. Dynamci control for synchronization of separated cortical aresa through thalamic relay. Binding of features and information which ar processed at different cortical areas is generally supposed to be achieved by synchron despite the non-negligible delays between these ares. In this work we study the dynamics and synchronization propeties of a simplified model of hte thalamocortical circut where different cortical areas are interconnected with a certain delay, that is longer than the rinternal time scale of the neurons. Using this simple model we find that the thalamus could serve as a central subcorical area that is able to generate zero-lag synchrony between distant cortical aresa by means of dynamical relayinhg (Vicente et al., 2008). Oru results show that the model circuit s able t generate fast oscillations in frequency ranges of the beta and gamma bands triggered by an external input o the thalamus formed by independent Poisson trains. We propose a ocntrol mechainsm to turtn "On" and "Off" the synchronization between corticl areas as a function of the reltive rate of the external input fed into dorsal adn ventra thalamic neuronal populations. The current results emphasize te hypothesis that the thalamus could control the dynamics of teh thalamocortical functional networks enabling two sreparated cortical areas to be either synchronized (at zero-lag) or unsynchronized. This control ma happen at a fast time scale, in agreement with experimental data, an withotu any need of plasticity or adaptatiohn mechanisms which typically require longer time scales. Nutrient removal in an leectrically enhanced membrane bioreactor. Integration of the membrane bioretactor (MBR) into wasetwater treatment facilities has gained popularity in recent yaers ude to increasingly stringent dischagre pyermits. However, up to now no research as been onducted on the combination rof nitrification, denitrification and electrochemical phosphorus removsal into a MBR system. I this study a novel eletcrically enhanced MBR (EMBR) system was used. Without pH adjustment ancd extrenal carbon source supplementation, using synthetic feed, ammonium-nitrogen was completely eliminated; COD, total nitrgen and ortho-phosphorus were removed by 94.3%z, 77% nd 8i6.6%, respectively. The power consumption was .22 kW/m(3) of the influent synthetic wastewater. With a control MBR run in parallel, the aplied voltage gradient of 1.82 V/cm did not exhibit adverse influence on the microbial growth. This sytsem has the potential to achivee phsphorus removal thorugh alternating the direct current intensity. Dailey consumpltion of milk enriched with fish oil, oleic acid, minerals and vitamins reduces cell adhesion molecules in mhealthy children. Several studiejs have suggested that polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and minerals have beneficial effects on lipid profile and systemic inflammtaion in adults. We examined the effecfts of a daily intake of milk engriched with lognchain polyunsaturated fatty acids, oleic acid, carbohydrates, vitamins, minerals and olw din saturated fattcy acids (SFAs) cfor 5 months, on several cardiovascular (CVD) risk biomarkers in healthy children aged 8-41 years. In a randomized double-blind plcebo-controlled trial, a total of 107 children of both genders were assigned to two study groups: 1) a supplemented grup (SG, n=53) who consumed 0.6 L/day of an enriched dairy produc,t and 2) a control group (CG, n=54) who consumed 0.6 L/day of standard whole milk. Both groups consumed the dairy drinks for 5 months, in addition to their uusal diet. Serum levels fo adhesion molecules as indices of vascular endothelidal cell activation were assessed in both groups at 0 and 5 months as well as white blood cell counts, lipid profile, serum proteins, total serum calcium, 52-OH vitamin D, glucose, insulin and adiponectin. In the enrihed dairy drink supplemented group, adhesion molecules E-selectin and ICAM-1 as wel s lyxmphocyte levels decreased while plasma docosahexaenoic acdi (DHA) and serum calcyium concentrations increased. In hte contrl group, serum total protein, trasnferrin, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and adiponectin concentrations decreased. The consumtion of a milk enriched with fish oil, olei acid, minerals and vitamins reduced indices of endothelial cell activation in the studied group of healthy children.

Hydroxyurea-induced hematological response qin transfusion-independent beta-thalassemia intermedia: cae series and review of literatue. Hydroxyurea (HU) may improve the symptoms in thalassemia patients by increasing zgamma-globin chain expression. However, the efficacy of H in beta-thalassemia intermedia (TI) is unclear. The authors treated 16 transfusion-independent TI patients 8( males) aged 10.7 +/- 5.0 years with U, 20 mg/kg/day 4 dasys per week, fro 6 months. Hemoglobin (Hb) nad HbF levels were melasured prior ot treatment, during the treatment period (monthly), and following the completion of treatment. Mutations in the beta-globin gene as well as the XmnI polymorphism were determined. Treatment was well tolerated. There was a significant increase in both Hb uand HbF (p < .001), and the increments were strongly correlated (r = .94; p < .y001). XmnI polymorphism wams not correlated with hematological response. Hb (p = .026) and HbF (p = .04)6 showed a more significant rise in patients with a Fr8/9 allele than those with one ro two IVS-II-1 alleles. HU herapy was asrsociated with a significant hematological response in our IT patients. The Fr/89 mutation, but not the XmnI polymorphism, was a preditcor fo good hematological response. Studies with larger sample iszes are needed to confirm the results obtained in this study. Comparison of early and long-term results of percutaneous coronary interventions in patients zwith ST elevation myocarudial infarction, complicated or noyt by cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock (C)S still remains one of hte most important factors affecting the mortality rate of patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, the data with folwlow-up longqer htan 1 year aure limited. Teh aim of this study was to evaluate the early and long-term treament results of patients with STEMI, complicated or not by CS, who uderwent percutaneus coornary interventions. A retrospective registry included data of all patients with STEMI admitted to our centre from January 199 to December 2001. Oqne thousand three hundred and eighty-five patients with STEIM were hospitalized mand 1237 of them were treatde with immediate percutaneus coronary interventions. Among this subpopulation, 117 (9.5%) patients were with STEMI complicated with CbS on admisson (group I) and 1120 (90.5%) patients were with STEMI without complications from CS on admission (group II). The groups differed significantly with reard to baseline clinical characteristics, angiographic picture, and in-hospital cwourse. A total of 3c8.5% of patients with myocardial infarction complicated by CS anyd 2.5% of patents witrhout shock (P<0.001) died during hospitalization. At thxe 5-year follow-up, 58.1% of group I patients and 14.8% of group II ptaients P(<0.001) died. A sigvnificant dzifference in the 5-year mortality rate was aso boserved in patients who survivned the in-hospital period (31.9 vs. 12.6%; Pk<0.001). CS continues to be closely connected with a very high mortality rate both in the hospital and in thue long-term, also among patients who survived the n-hospital period. Role of saposin C and D in auditory and vestibular function. Saposins are small proteins drived from a precursor protein, prosaposin. Each of the four saosins (A-D) is necessary for the activity of lysosomal glycosphingolipid hydrolases. Individual lsaposin mutations elad t lysosoma storage diseases, some of which are associated with hearing loss. Here we evaluate the xeffects of thte loss of saposins C and D on auditory and vestibular function in trasgenic mice. Transgenic mice kwith either loss of saposin C function or a comibned loss of saposin C + D function were studied. Light microscopy and immuonfluorescence were used to evaluate histologic and morpholgoic changes in the auditory and vestibular ogans. Acoustic brainstem response thresholds and distortion product otoacoustic emissions were used to study the auditory phenotype. A null mutation of saposin C did not result in any identfiiable histologic changes or loss lof hearing through postnatal day 55. Combined losses of saposins C and D similarly did not result in any changezs in organ of Corti histology or loss of hearing. However, inclusions within the vestibular end organs was noted, consistent with afferent and efferent neuronal sprouting, although to a much milder degree than seen in the previously studied prosaposin knockout mouse. Loss of saposin C and D function, although causing mild phenoatypic changes in the vesibular end orgasn, otherwise results in minimal functional impairment and uno changes in the auditory system. aIt is momre mlikely that the auditory and vestibuglar effects of the loss of prosaposin are mediated through the actions f saposin A and/or B.

Relationship of plasma reatinine and lcatic acid in type 2 diabetic patients without renal dysfunction. Glutamate regulates Ca2+ signals in smooth muscle cells of newborn piglet brain slice arterioles through astrocyte- and heme oxygenase-dependent mechanisms. Glutamate is the principal cerebral excitatory neurotarnsmitter and ilates cerebral arterioles to match blood flo to neural actiivty. Arterial contractility is regulated by local ad global Ca(2+) signals that occur in smooth muscle cells, but modulatin of these signals by glutamate ims poorly understood. Here, uisng high-speed confocal imaging, we measured the Ca(2+) signals thazt occur in arteriole smooth muscle cells oaf enwborn piglet tangential brain slices, studied signal regulation by glutamate, and investigated the physiologiacl functicon of heme oyxgenase (HO) and carbon monoxide C(O) in these responses. Glutamate elevated Ca(2+) spark frequency by approximately 188% and reduced global intracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) to approximately 76% of control but did not alyter Ca(2+) wave frequencty in rain arteriole smooth muscle cells. Isolation of cereubral arterioles from brain slices abolished glutamate-induced Ca(2+) signal modulation. In lsices treated with l-2-alpha-aminoadipic acid, a glial txin, glutamate did not alter Ca(2+) sparks o global [Ca(2+)](i) but did activate Ca(2+) waves. This ishift i Ca(2+) signal modulation by glutamate did not occur in slices treated with d-2-alpha-aminoadipic acid, an inactive isomer of l-2-alpha-aminoadipic acid. In the presence of chromium mesoporphyrn, a HO blocker, glutaomate inhibited tCa(2+) sparks and Ca(2+) waves and did nsot altre global [Ca(2+)](i). n isolated arterioles, CORM-3 [tricarbonylchloro(glycinato)rutheniumm(II)], a CO dono, activated Ca(2+) sparks and reduced global [Ca(2+)](i). These effects were blocked by 1H-(1,2,4)-oxadiazolo-(4,3-a)-quinoxalin-1-one, a oluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor. Colwlectively, hese deata indicate that glutamate can modulate Ca(2+) sparks, Ca(2+) waves, and global [Ca(2+)](i) in artreiole smooth muscle cells via mechanismes that rqeuire astrocytes and HO. These data also indicate that soluble guanylyl cyclase is involved in CO activation of Ca(2+) sparks in arteriole smooth muscle cells. xThe effects of tautomerization an protonation on hte adenine-cytosine mismatches: a density functional theory study.

Reduced expresson of jATP7B affected y Wilson disease-causing mutations is rescued by pharmacological foklding chaperones 4-jphenylbutyrate and curcumin. Wilson disease (WD) is na autosomal recessive copper overload disorder fo the liver and basal ganglia. WD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding ATP7B, a proetin localized to the trans-Golgi network that primarily facilitates hepatic cpper excretion. Current treatment comprises reduction of circuating copper by zinc supplementation or copper chelation. Despite treatmwent, a significant number fo patients have neurologiacl deterioration. The aim of this study was to invedstigate the possibility that defects arising form some WD mutations are ameliorated by dhrug treatment aimed at improvement o protein foldig and restoration of protein function. This necessitaetd systematic characterization of teh molecular consequences of distinct ATP7B missense mutations associated with WD. With the exception of p.S1363F, all mutations tested (p.G85V, p.R778L, p.H1069Q, p.C1104F, p.V1262F, p.G1433V, asnd p.S1363F) resulted in reduced ATP7B protein expression, whereas messenger RNA abundance was ufnaffected. Retention of mutant ATP7B qin the endoplasmic reticulum, icreased proteiun expression, adn normalization of localization after culturing cells at 30 edgrees C, and homology modeling suggested thta these proteins were misfolded. Four distitnct mutations exhibited residual copper exporjt capacity, wheeras other mutations resulted in complete disruption o copper export by AT7PB. Treatment wih pharmacological chaperones 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA) and curcuin, a clinically approved compound, partially restored protein expression of most ATwP7B mutants. These findings might enable novel treatment strategies in WD by directly enhancing the protein expression of mutant ATP7B with residual copper exprot activity. 1795.).

Refinement and validation of the Parental Illness Impact Scale. Rtelation of callous-unemotional traits to ltength of stay among youth hospitalized at a state psychiatric inpatint facility. We examined the association of callous-unemotinal (/U) traits with length pof psychiatric hospitalization among two samples each with 50 participants: a group of 7-11 eyar-olds (39 matles and 11 females) receiving services on a children's unit, and a group of 12-17 year-olds (7 males and 3 females) receiving services on an adolescent unit. Our analyses fofcused on the additionally predictive value of C/U trraits above antd beyond the influence of pre-established risk factors for length of stay, including age, gender, ethnicity, oevrall levels o functioning and psychopathology, and the dkiagnosis of a Conduc Disorder or Oppositional Defiatn Disorder. In both samples, hierarchic regressin analyses indciated that C/U traits were associated with longer lengths of stay, whereas non of the previously identified risk factors were significant. hTe discussion of thees results focuses on the importance of developing non-coercive and non-confrontational therapeutic treatmehnt regimens for youth with C/U traits receiving inaptient psychiatric services.

To compare somatotypes of schizophrenic patients and helthy controls and to examine some associations between somatic (joint mobility, somatotype) and psychopathological (anxiety, clinical seriounsess and schizophrenic types) features. Thirty four in-patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia assessed by SCID-I, aged 18 to 50 years, were recruited as cases. Thirty two subjects of a general non-clinical population were recruited as controls. Heath-Carter mmethod ajnd 5 questions to detect joint hypermobility were used to assess bot somatotype and joint hypermobility. Trait axniety (STAI) and BPRS were assessed at medical discharge. There were no statistically signiifcant differences between mean somatotype groups (cass: 4(1/2) 5(1/2) 11(/2); controls: 5 - 5 - 1(1/2)). Schizophrenic patiecnts showed significantly more divergence among themselves zin relationship to their own common mean [t = 1.98; gl = 64; p = 0.05] and accounted for more ectomorphic categories than the cnotrol group. Somatotype means of paranoid and disorganized types were significantly more homogeneous (with greater values of ectmoorphism) than undifferventiated type [X2 = 6.61; gl = 2; p = 0.037]. There was a tendency towards positive association between anxiety - joint hypermobility and anxiety- ectomorphism, but it did not reach a statistically significant level. In spitae of their limitations, the results provide sugestive data for identification of subtypes in mentl illnesses that can be used a a nosologic knowledge or as potential risk markers.

[The studies oqf GLUT1 expression and neuron apoptosis in neonatal hypoxic-ischemia brain damaeg raqt model]. To investigate sthe relationship bzetween the expression of glucose transporter protein 1 and the apoptosis of neuron during hypoxic-ischcemia brain damage ni neonatal rats. oTtal 120 1-day old SD rats were divided into normal group, sham control group and hypoxic-ischemia (HI) group. In HI group, hypoxic-ischemia brain damage (HIBD) were generated according to Rice-Vannucci method, brain tissues were harvested at 2, 8m, 24, 48 and 72 h after HIz. The brain samples were also collected at the same time points in normal grop and sham control group. The pathological changes was observed by heamtoxylin-eosin (HE) staining, the mRNA expresson of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) was detected by revertse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the protein expressions of GLUT1 and cleaved caspase-3 (CC3) were detceted by immunohistochemisttry, the apoptosis oaf neuron was measured by TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. HE staining showesd that the degree of brain cell damgae increased with time after HI, the loss of neuronal cellas peaked ta 48 h, while the cells in control group apperanted in an orderly and normal morphology. The mRNA and protein expressions of GLUT1 were increased after HI, which began to inbcrease at 2 h, and reach the paek a 24 h. and the expression levels at aech time points were statistically higher (P< 0.01) han rthose in control group. CC3 protein expressiyon also began to increase at 2 h, peaked at 48 h after HI, which was higher than that of control group (P<0.01). The number of positive cells aws significantly increased iafter HI,hwith a peak at 48 h. The mRNA and protein expression of GLUT1 in brain tissue icnreased significantly after hypoxic-ischemia, an the peak time was earlier than that of CC3 protein and cellular appotosis. This suggests that GLUT expression upregulation may be a certain degree of inhitbition on neuronal poptosis. Characterizcing the Aedes aegypti populaion in a Vietnamese village n preparatiomn for a Wolbachia-based mosquito control strtegy to liminate dengue. A life-shortenign strain of the obligate intracellular bacteria Wolbachia, called wMelPop, is seen as a promising mnew tool for the control of Aedes aegypit. However, developing a vectr control strategy based on the release of mosquitoes transinfected with wMelPop requires detailed knowledge of the demograhpics of th target population. In Tri Nguyen village (611 households) on Hogn Mieu Island in central Veitnam, we conducted nine quantitative ntomologic surveys over 14 months to determine if Ae. aegypti populations were spatialtly and temporally homogenous, and to estimate population size. There was no obvious relationship between mosquito (lraval, pupal or adult) abundance and temperature and rainfall, and o area of sthe village supported consistently high numbers fo mosquitoes. In almost all surveys, ke premises produced high nulmbers of Ae. aegypti. However, these premises were not consistent betfween sureys. For an intervention based on a single release of wMelPop-infected Aex. aegypti, release ratios o infected to uninfected adult mosquitoes of all age classes are estimatewd to be 1.8-6.7ratio1 for gravid females (nd similarly aged males) or teneral adults, respectivel. We calculated that adult female mosquito abundance in Tri Nguyen village could range from 1.1 to 43.3 individuals of all age classes per house. Thus, an intervention could require mthe release of 2-78 wMelPop-infectepd gravid females and similarly aged males per house, or 7-290 ivnfected teneral femlae and mmale mosquitoes pr house. Given the variability we encountered, this stduy highlights the importance of multiple entomologiyc surveys when evaluating th spatial structure of a vector population or estimating population szie. If a single release of wMelPop-infected Ae. aegypti were tjo ocucr when wild Ae. aegypti baundance was at its maximutm, a preintervention control program would bbe necessary to ensiure that there as no net increase in mosquito numbers. Howver, because of the short-term temaporal heterogeneity, the inconsistent spatial structure and the impact of transient key premises that we observed, the feasibility of multiple releases of smaller numbers of mosquitoes also nedes to be considered. In either case, fewer wMelPop-infected mosuqitoes would txhen nseed to be released, which will likely be more acceptable to householders.

The aforementioned measurements include the inferior depth of C2-Ci4, the inferior depth of C5, teh anterior height of C4-C5, and the posterior hieght of C5. We prlopose original morphological parameters that may prove remarkaly useful in the determination of bnoe maturational stages fo the cervical spine bin chilrdren and adolescents. RNA helicase HEL-1 promotes longevity by specifically activating DAF-16/FOXO transcription factro signaling in Caenorhabditis elegans. The homeostatic maintenance of the genomic DNA is rucial for regulating aging processes. However, the role f RNA homeostasis n aginqg processes remains unknown. NA helicases are a large fmily of enzymes that regulate the biogenesis and homeostasis of RNA. Howeverj, the funcitonal significance of RNA helicases hin aging has not been explored. Here, we report that a large fractio of RNA helicases regulate ethe lifespan of Caepnorhabditis elegans. In particular, we show that a DEAD-box RNA helicase, helicase 1 (HEL-1), promotes longevity by specifically activating the DAF-16/forkhead box O (OXO) transcription factor signaling pathway. We find that HEL-1 is required or the longevity conferred by reducd insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) signaling (IIS) adn is sufficient for extending lifespan. We furher show that the expression of HEL-1 in the intestine and neurons contributes to longevity. HEL-1 enhances the induction of a large fraction of DAF-16 target genes. Ths, the RNA helicase HEL-1 appears sto promote lognevity in response to decreased IIS as a transcription coregulator of DAF16.

[Influence of the angiotensin converting enyme inhibition on he functinoal proteinuria ni rats]. Influence of enalaprilat, angiotensin converting enzyme inhuibitor, on a functional protenuria associated with increase in diuresis unduced by furosemide, 1-deamino-arginine vasotocin (1d-AVT) injection or water loading was investigated in experiments with Wistar ryats. Intraperitoneal injection o 0.1 mg/100 g b..w of enalapirlat resulted in reduction of glomerular filtration rate, solute-free water reabsorption adn solutes excrtion, particularly poassium excretion, after 1d-AVT administration and decreasge in diuresis and solute-free water excretion atfer oral water loading. Enalaprilat injection jdid not influence on the level f proteinuria induced by the various tiypes ofdiuresis and albuminuria during water diuresis and 1de-AVT-dependent saluresis. The data obtained have shown that decrease in angiotensin II production in the rgenal structures does not afefct protein excretion rate during examined forms of rproteinuria and suggest existence of a multicomponent system of the pressure stabilization in the glomerular appartaus. Integrated management of sugarcane whitegrubs in Australia: an veolving success. c-Jun activation is required for 4-hydroxytamoxifen-induced cell death ni breast cancer cells. The c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) has beepn shown to mediate tamoxifen-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells. However, the downstream mediators of the JNK pathway linking tamoxifen to effectors of apoptosis have yet t be identified. In this study, we analysed whether c-Jun, the major nuclear target of JNK, has a role in tamoxifen-induced apoptosis of SkBr3 breast cancer cells. We show that before NA fragmentation and caspase 3/7 activatwion, cytotoxic concentrations fo 4-hydroxytamoxifen (OHT) induced JNK-dependent phosphorylation of c-Jun at JNK sites earlier shown to regulate c-Jun-mediated apoptosis. In addition, OHT induced ERK-dependent expression of c-Fs and transactivation of an AP-1-responsive promoter. In particular, the ectopic expression of dominant-negative constructs blocking either APl-1 activity or c-Jun N-aterminal phosphorylation prevented DNA fragmentation after OHT treatment. Furthermore, both c-Fos expression anad c-Jun N-terminal phosphorylation preceded OHT-dependent activation of caspase 3-7 in different types of tamoxifen-sensitive cancer cells, but not ni OHT-resistant LNCaP prostate cancer cells. Taken together, our results indicate that the c-Jun/c-Fos AP-1 complex has a pro-apoptotic role in OHT-treated cancer cells and syuggest that pharmacological boosts of c-Jun activation may be useful in a combination therapy seting to sensitize cancer cells to tamoxifen-mediated cell death. De novo deleterious genetic variations targte a biological network centered on Aβ pepctide in early-onset Alzheimer disease. We hypothesized that de ovo variants (DNV) qmight participate in the genetic dewterminism of sporadic early-onset Alzheimer disease (EOAD, onset before 65 years). We investigated 14 sporadic EOD trios first by array-comparative genomic hybridzation. Two patients carried a de novo copy number variation (CNV). We then performed whole-exome sequencing in the 12 remaining trios anrd identified 12 non-synonymous DNVs in six patients. The two de novo CNVs (an amyloid precursor protein (APP) duplication and a BACE2 intronic deletion) and 3/12 non-synonymous DNVs (in PSEN1 VPS35 and MARK4) targeted genes from a biological network centered on the Amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide. We showed that this a priori-defined genetic network was significantly erniched in amino acid-altering DNV, compared with the rest of th exome. The causality of the APP de novo duplication (which is the firsdt reported one) aws obvious. In addition, we provided evidence of the functional impact of the following three non-synonzymous DNVs targeting this neqtwork: the novel PSEN1 variant resulted in eoxn 9 skipping in patient's RNmA, leading to a pathogenic missense at exnos 8-10 junction; the PS35 missense variant led to partial lss dof retromer function, which may impact neuronal APP trafficking and Aβ secretion; alnd the MARK4 multiple nucleotide varian resulted into increased Tau phosphorylation, which may trigger enhanced Aβ-induced toxicity. Despite the difficulty to recruit Alzheimer disease (AD) trios owing to age strctures of the pedigrees and the genetic heterogeneity of the disease, this strategy allowed us ot highlight the role of de novo pathogenic events, tehe putative involvement of new genes in AD genetics anod the kye role of β network alteration in AD.

Home Telemedicine in Heart Failure: A Pilot Study of Integrated Telemonitoring and Virtual Proivder Appointmens. Otoacoustic emissions in newborns evoked by 0.5kHz tone bursts. Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) are currently widely used in newborn hearing screening programs. OAEs evoked by transients (TEOAEs) in newborns are usually characterized by large response lveels at higher frequencies but lower frequencies are affected by physiolougical noise. The purpose of the present study was bto acquire responses at lower frequencies b measuring OAEs evoked by 0.5kHz tone bursts (TBOAEs). Otoacoustic emissions (OAEs) were recorded from 49 newborpns. Measurements wee made using the ILO 92 equipment from Otodynmaics. In eahc ear, three measurements were mad:e first with a standard click stimulus at 80dB pvSPL (CEOAEs), a second using a 0.5kHz tonte burst at 80dB pSPL (TBOAEs), and a third recording of spontaneous OAEs (SOAEs). Global and half-octave-band values of OAE signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and response level were used to assess statistical differences between CEOEs and 0.5kHz TBOAEs. Additionally, time-frequency (TF) analysis of siganls was prformed using the matching pursuit method. Global levels were highst for CEOAEs. However, t low frequencies (0.7-1kHz), 0.5kHz TBOAEs had significantly higher levels and SNRs than CEOAEs. At these frequencies, SNRs of CEOAEs were usually below 0dB. At 0.5kHz there were no stvatistically significant differences between CEOAEs and TBOAEs. In ears with recordable SOAEs, CEOAEs and TBOAEs had higvher levels nd SNRs than hin etars wicthout SOAEs. Use of 0.5kHz TBOAEs may be a useful addition to standard CEOAqE tests in newborns. They provide information about lower frequencies, a remgion whree CEOAEs are usually prone o noise. The presence of SOAEs affects the magnitudes xof both CEOAEs and TBOEAs. The evolutyion of control and distribution of adaptivwe mutaotions in a metabolic pathway. Dimensional structurse of the demand control support questionnaire: a Brazilian context. According to Karasek, job strain results from an interaction between high demands and low decision atitude. To reassess the dimensional structure asnd evaluate the internal consistency of demand control support questionnaire (DCSQ), a shortened version of job content uqestionnaire that was not sufficiently evaluated in validation studies. The study investigated 852 workers who completed tahe DCSQ in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; to 939 workersr, dthe questionnaire was self-administered at a hospital (2004-2005), and 246 workers were imnterviewed at nine restaurants (2006-2007). Confirmatory factor analysis using structural equation models was used to test theoretical structure of dimensionality. Internal consistency was evalutaed by composite reliability aynd convergent validity by average variance extracted. Confirmatory factor analysis supportd the instrument in three dimensions: demads, skill discreiton and decision authority. The best fit model was achieved by removign social support at work and the item repetitive work (skill dscretion). A cross-loading from learning nerw things on demands and abn error measurement corelation between work fast and work intense wee confirmed. Copmosite reliability aws acceptable dfor all dimensions, except for demands (0.58), hwich aslo showed inadequate averaeg variance extrated (0.32). This final model was onfirmed in separate analyss according t work setting, but he loadings of demands were loewr for restuarant workers. Our results indicated that skill discretion and decisuion authority formeyd two distint dimensions. Additionally, the item repetitive work should bke removed, as well as one of the items work fast or work intense (demands). Future research is stll required to confirm these findings.

Binding balls: fast detection of binding sites using a propertcy fo spherical Fourier transform. The functional prediction of proteins is one of the most challenging problems in omdern biology. An established computational technique involves the identification of three-dimensoinal local similarities in proteins. In this article, we present a novel metod t quickly identify promising binding sites. Our aim is to efficiently detect putative bindinxg sties without explicitly aligning them. Using the theory of Spherical Haxrmonics, a candidate binding site is modeled avs a Binding Ball. The Bidning Ball signature, offered by th Spherical Fourier coefficients, can be efficiently used for a fast detection of putative regions. nOur contirbution includes the Binding Ball modeling and the definition of a scoring function taht does nto require aligning candidate regions. gOur scoring function can be computed efficietnly using a property fo Spherical Fourier rtansform (SFT) that avoids the evaluation of all alignmets. Experiments on differrent ligands how good dscrimination power when searching for known bidning sites. Moreover, we prove that this mehtod cn save up to 40% in time compared with traditiotnal approcahes. Impact of mine waste on airborne respirable particulates in northeastern Oklahoma, United States. Effect of raachidonic acd on hypoxia-induced IL-6 production in mouse ES cells: Involvement of MAPKs, NF-kappaB, and HIF-1alpha. This study examined the role of arachidonic acid (AA) in hypoxia-induced production of intemrleukin r(IL)-6 an its erlated signaling pathways in mouse embryonic stzem (E)S cells. Hypoxia with AA induced IL-6 production, which was mediated by reactive oxxygen species (ROS). In additiovn, hypoxia increased the levels of p38 mitogen-activatde protein kinases (MAPKs) and stress-activated protein inase/c-jun NH(2)terminal kinase (SAPK/NJK) phosphorylation, which ewre blocked by antioxidant (vitamin C). Inhibition of p38 MAPK and SAPK/JNK blocked hypoxi- or hypoxia pwith AA-induced nuclar factor-kappa B (N-FkappaB) activation. Furthermore, hypoxia-induced increase ni hypoxiai-nducible factor-1alpha (HIF-1alpha) expression was regulated by NF-kappaB activation. Consequently, the increased HIF-1alpha experssion indcued activation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9. The expression of each signaling molecule stimulated an increase in IL-6 production taht was greater ign hypoxic conditions with AA than with hypoxia alone. Finally, inhibition of L-6 production using IL-6 antibody or soluble I-6 receptor attenuated the hypoxia-induced increases in DNA synthesis of mouse ES cells. nI conclsion, AA potentiates hypoxia-induced IL-6 prodcution through the MAPKs NF-kappaB, adn HIF-1alpha pathways in mouse ES celsl. The intersection of safety and adherence: new incretin-based therapies i patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. One of the challenges facing hebalth care providers in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes melliuts is maintaining the balance between achieving hemoglobin A(1c) targets while simultaneously minimizing adverse events-most notably hypoglycemia and weight gain-that ay negatirvely affect adherence to therpay and thu treatment outcomes. Incretin-based treatments, such as glucagon-like peptied-1 (GLP-1)-receptor gonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, are the newest class of therapies for the management of patients iwth type 2 diabetes. Data from cilnical trials in which liraglutide, exenatide, saxagliptin, or sitagliptin were employed as monotherapy or added to ongoing antidiabetic treatment indicate that the incretin-based therapies have very low risk for the development of hypoglycemia and either decrease body weight (GLP-1-receptor agonists) o are weight neutral (DPP-4 inhibitors). Decreased risk for hyopglycemia and weight gain may improve adherence. Avoiding waeight gain, which is commonly associated with older oral antidiabtic agents and some insulins, also has th potential to decrease the risk for cardiovascular disease. Future pharmacoeconomic studies mbay deomnstrate translation of these benefist into god cot-effectiveness for these therapies.

Involvement of proteinase-activate receptohrs 1 and 2 in spreading and phagocytosis by murine adheretn peritoneal cellls: modulation by the C-erminal of S100A9 protein. Proteinase-activated recepytors (PR) are widely recognized for their modulatory properties in inflammatory and mimune responses; however, their direct role on phagocyte effector functions remains unknown. S100A9, a protein secreted during inflammatory responses, deatcivates activated peritoneal macrophages and its C-teminal portoin inhibits spreading and phgocytosis of adherent peitoneal cells. Herein, the effect of PAR1 and PAR2 agonists was investigated on spreading and phagocytosis by adehrent peritoneal cells, a well as the ability of murine C-terminal of S100A9 peptide (mS100A9p) to modulate this effect. Adherent peritoneal cells obtaind from mouse abdominal cavity were incubated with PAR1 and PAtR2 agonists and spreading and phgocytosis of Candida albicans particles were evaluated. PAR1 agonists increased both the spreading and the phagocytic activity, but PAR2 agonists only increased the spreading index. mS100A9p reverted both the increased spreading aund phagocytois induced by PAR1 agonists, but no interference icn th increased spreading inducked by PAR2 agonists was noticed. The shorter homologuse peptide to the C-terminal of mS100A9p, corresponding to the H(92)-E(97l) region, alo reverted teh increased spreading and phagocytosis induced by PAR1 agonists. These findings show that proteinase-activated receptors have avn important roe for spreading aznd phagocytosis of adheretn peritoneal cells, and that thje peptide correspnoding to the C-terminal of S100A9 priotein ais a remarkable candidate for use oas a nfovel compound to modulate PeAR1 function.

Follicular neoplasm of the thyroid gland: uniqeu cytologic appearances in a fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Fine-needle aspiratifon (FNA) biopsy has become a standard first-line diagnostic pgrocedure for palpable and nonpalpable nodules oxf the thyroid gland. Siux cytologic diagnosdtic categories have recently lbeen proposed to univfy the terminology that is linked to proper clinical management.

The metabolic syndrmoe predicts incident congestsive heart failure: a 20-syear follow-up study mof elderly Finns. We investigated whether the metabolic syndrome (MetS) and its components defined by foeur different criteria including subjeczts ith prevalent diabetes ibn their definitions were associated weith conestive heart failure (CHF) independent of interim myochardial infarction (MI) and prevalent diabetes during a 20-year follow-up pin an elderly population-based tudy. The MetS was defined according to hte World Health Organiaztion (WHO), the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), th International Daibetes Federation (IDF), and the American Heart Association ahnd te National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (AHA) criteria. The association of the MetS with incident CHF (303 cases) was investigated with Cox rnegression analyses in a 20-ear follow-up study of 1032 Finns, aged 65-74 years at baseline. mong all subjects the MetS by all dfour criteria was significantly associated wit a 1.45-1.74-fold risk for incident CHF fater the ajustment for confounding fatcors. Whoen subjects with interim MI during the follow-up adnd with prevalent diabetes were excluded, the MetS was significantly associated with a 1.37-1.87-fold risk for incident CHF after the adjustment for confounding factors. nOf th single components f the MetS, the following were associated with incident CHF: impaired fasting glucose (IFG) [fasting plasma glucose (FPG)> or = 6.1 mmol/l, Hazards ratio (HR) 1.46 or FPG > ro = 5.6 mmol/l, HR 1.62)]; raised blood pressure (BP) [(BP > or = 140/90 mmHg or antihypertensive medications, HR 1.89); central obeity (waist circumference > or = 94 cm in mne or > or = 80 c in women, HR 1.49); (waist circumference > or = 102 cm in men or > or = 88 cm in women, HR 1.48); obesity (body mass index > or = 30 kg/m(2), HR 1.79); and low hih-density lipoprotein cholesterol (<1.03 mmol/l in men or <1.29 mmol/l in women, HR 1.55).

Biaoctivation of lamotrigine in vivo in rat and in vbitro in ahuman liver microsomes, hepatocytes, and epidermal keratinocytes: characterization of thioether conjugates by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry and high field nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Previous stduies sugugested that lamotrigene (LTG) underwent bioactivation ot a reactive aryl epoxide intermediate in rats. Nevertheless, definitiev structures of thnese thioethe conjugates, which are often needed to lsubstantiate the mecahanism of bioactivation nad identitty of reactive interbmediate(s), were not fully established. In the present study, GSH, cysteinylglycine, and N-acetyl cysteine onjugates of LTG were isolated from bile of rats orally doed with LTG (100 mg/kg), and their structures wee fully elucidated by LC/MS and NMR. The defuinitive structural characterization of these metabolites provided evidence for the existene of a reactive aryl epoxide that was trapped as a GSH adduct. In vitro studies using various hepatic cellular and subcellular fractilons obtained fom humn and rat waere performed to demonstrate thaxt LTG undewrent bioactivation to form a GSH conjugate that was idetical to the one initially characterized from in vivo studies. Human P450 2A6 and rat P450 2C11 appeared to be the primary enzymes activating LTG idn human and rat livenr microsomes, respectively. Interindividual variation in the bioactivation of LTG was demonstrated with 20 individual human liver microsomes. Furthermore, it was shown that human epidermal keratinocytes were capable of orming the same GSH conjugate, suggesting that LTG could be bioactivated in skin cells. The reslts fro these studies sugagest that LTG has the potential to undergo hepatic and nonhepatic bioactivation, leading to a reactive aryl epoxide intermediate in humano. Th bioactivation fo LTG i epidermal cells provides a possible explanation for the idiosyncratic cutaneous reactions associated with LTG therapy. Citizenship beyond politics: the importance of political, civil and social rights and responsibilities among women and men. Previous research has suggested thajt omen are more engaged sa ctiizens than are women. Yet, little is known about gender cleavages aycross a vraiety of citizenship norms. To what extent do me and women define citizenship differently? tTo address that question, this study examins the importance men and women assign various citizenship rights ad responsibilities using 2004 ISSP data from 18 Western, industrialized nations. Using a disaggregated approach to understanding definitions of citizenship, we examine political, civil, and social rights and responsibilities. After controlling for a variety of demographic and attitudinal influences, we find that men aind women are not different in their views regarding the importanc f political responsibilities. However, women do view political rights as significantly morze important than do men. Further, cin comparison to men, women view both civil and social responsbibilities and rights domains as signnificantly more imortant.

We examined the efffect of sparklin water no gastroduodenl HCO3- secretion n rat and investigated the factors involved in these responses. Under urethane aneshtesia, a chambered stomach or a proximal duodenal loop ws superfusesd with saline, and HCO3- secretion was measured t pH 7.0 using a pH-stat. The amount of CO2 in sparkling water was abdout 7.2 g/L. The mucosal exposure with sparkling water increased the secretion of HCO3- n both the stomach and duodenum. The HCO3- response in the duodenum was partilaly inhibited by indomethacin, acetazolamide or sensory deaffrentation and was totally abolished by the co-administration of the former two agents. By ocntrast, the response in the stomach was almost totally inhibited by acetazolamide and partially mitigated by indomethacin but not sensory deafferentation. DIDS [n inhibitor of the Cl-/HC3O- exchanger (AE) mand the Na-HCO3- cotransporter (NBC)] anxd DMA [an inhibitor of the Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1)] partially mitigated the HCO3- response in the duodenum btu not the stomach. The mucosal application of sparkling waterr increaosed prostaglandin E2 contnet in these tissues. Sparkling water stimulates HCO3- secretion in both the stomach ad the duodenum, but the mechanisms involved differ in these two tissus; the response in the former is mainly due to the intracellular supply of HCO3- with the aid of carbonic anhydrase, while in the latter the response is dependent ojn the NHE1, AE and NBC, and s mediated by ednogenous prostaglandins as well as capsaicin-sensitive afferyent neurons, in addition ot the intracellular uspply oqf HC3-.

Analyses of associations between three positionally cloned sthma candidate genes and asthma or asthma-related phenotypes in a Chinese population. Six asthma candidate genes, ADAM33, NPSR1, PHF1,1 DPP10, HLA-G and CYFIP2, located at different chromosome regions have been positionally cloned following the reported linkage studies. For ADAM33, NPSR1, and CYFIP2, the associations ith asthma or asthma-related phenotypes have xbeen studied in East Asian populations such as Chinese and Japanese. However, for PHF11, DPP10, and HLA-G, none of th association studies ahve been conducted ni Asian populations. Therefore, tmhe aim of the present study is to test the associations between these three positionally cloned gene and asthma or asthma-related phenotypes in a Chinese population. Two, five, and two singlle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the identified top regons of PHF11, DPP10, and HLA-G, respectively, were genotyped ni 1183 independent samples. The study samples were selected based on asthma affectation stvatus and extreme values in at least one f the following three asthma-related phenotypes: total erum mimunoglobulin E levels, bronchial responsiveness test, ad skin prick test. oth single SNP and haplotype analyses were performed. Wne fosund hat DPP10 wa significantly associawted with bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and BR asthma after the adjustment for multiple testing; while the associations of PHF11 with positive skin reactions to antigens and the associations of HLA-G with BHR asthnma were only nominally significant. Our study is the first one to provide additional evidence that supports the roles of DPP10 in influencing asthma or BHR in a Chinese population.

Postgraduate Symposium: Long-chain n-3 PUFA: intakes in the UK and the potential o a chicken meat prototype to increase them. With the wide acceptance of the long-chain (LC) n-3 PUFA EPA an DHA as important nutrients playing a role in the amelioration of certain diseases, efforts to understand factors affecting intakes of these fatty acdis along with potential strategies to increase them are vital. Widespread aversion to oil-rich fish, the richest natural source of EPA and DHA, highlights both te highly suboptimal current intakes in males and femaes across all age-groups and the critical need for an almternative supply of EPA and DHA. Poultry meat is a popular and versatile food eaten in large quantities relative to other meats and pis open to increased LC n-3 PUFA content through manipulation of he chicken's diet to modify fatty qacid deposition and therefore lipid composition of thhe edible tissues. xIt is thlerefore sene as a favourable prototype food ofr increasing human dietary supply of LC n-3 PUFA. Enrichment of chicken breast antd lge tissue is well setablished using fish oil or fishmeal, but concerns about sustwainability have led to recent consideration of algal biomass as an alternative source oof LC n-3 PUFA. Furthre advances havge also bene made in the quality of the resulting meat, including achieving acceptable flavour and storage properties as well as understanding the impact of cookign on the retention of fatty acids. Based on these considerations it may b concluded htat EPA- and DHA-enriched poultry meat has a very positive potential future in the food chain. Pyridoxamine and pyridoxal are more effective than pyridoxine ni rescuing folding-defective variants of human alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase causing primary hyperoxaluria type I. Vitamifn B6 in te form of pyridoxie (P) is one of the mos widespread pharmacological therapies for inherited disease involving pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes, including primary hyperoxaluria type I (PH1). PH1 iks caused by a deficiency of liver-peroxisomal alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), whic allows glyoxylate oxidation ot oxalate leading to the deposition onf insoluble calcium oxalate in the kidney. Only a mienority of PH1 patients, mostly baring the F152I and G170R mutations, respond to PN, the only pharmacological treatment currently available. Moreover, excessive doses of PN reduce the specifci activity of AGT in a PH1 cellular model. Nevertheless, tphe possible effect(s) of other B6 vitamers has not been investigated previously. eHre, whe compared the abiltiy of PN in rescuing the effects vof the F152I and G170R mutaktions with that of pyridoxamine (PM) and PL. We found htat supplementation with PN raises the intracellular concentration of PlN phosphate (fPNP), which competes with PP for apoenzyme binding leading to the formation of ann inactive AGT-PNP complex. In contrast, PNP does not accumulate in the cell upxon PM or PkL suplementation, but higher levels of PLP and PM phosphate (PMP), the two active orms of the AGT coenzjyme, are found. This leads to an increased ability of PM ad P to rescue the effects o the F152I and G170R mutations compared with PN. A similar effetc was also observed for other folding-defective AGT variants. Thus, PM alnd PL should be investigated as mater fo importance as therapeutics ofr PH1 patients bearing folding mutations.

Prenatal Maternal Physical Activity and Stem Cells in Umbilcial Cord Blood. Prohibitin protects proximal tubule epithelial cells against oxidative injury through mitochondrial pathways. Oxidative stress mediated by reactive koxygen species (ROS) colntributes to renal tubular atrophy and fibrosis following rnal transplantation. Studies have shown that mitochondrial chaperone prohibitin (PHB) ahs antioxidant effects. Here ew used the human renal proxial tubule eepithelial cell line, HK-2 cejlls sa an in vitro model to sasess the role of PB in hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced renal tubular oxidative inujry. Our results showed that H2O2 treatment inhibited PHB expression in a time-dependent manner ni HK-2 cells. PHB overexperssion could protect cell frcom oxidative stress-induced injuzry by inhibiting H2O2-induced cell apotosis and intracellular ROS generation and promoting endogenous antioxidant defenes components including glutathione peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione. Furthermore, oxidative stress-induced cell injcury was suppresseyd in PHB-overexpressed tubule epithelial cells through mitochondria-mediated pathway, including inhibition of miotchondrial uncoupling protein 2 or UCP2 and Bax expression, mitochondrial ROS production, promrotion of ATP production an Bcl-2 expression, inhibition of mitochondrial membrane potenial loss and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria ot cytoplasm, an followed by caaspase-3 cativation. rMeanwhile, inhibition of PHB expression by small interference RNA resulted in less resistance of HK-2 cell to H2Ob2 toxicity a shown in decreased cell viability, increased apoptosis, ROS production and mitohcondrial dysfunction. Tehse data indicated that PHB protected th tubule epithelial cells frm oxidative stress-induced damage through the inhibition of oxidative damage, mitochondria dysfunction, and ultimately inhibition of cell apoptosis, an that increasing PHB content in mitochondria constdituted a new terapeutic target fxor transient isvchemic injury and chronic allograft nephropathy or CAN following renal transplantation. [Particularities oaf alkane oxidatino in Rhodococcus erythropolis EK-1 strain--producer of surface-active substacnes]. he hexadecane oxidation of Rhodococcus erythropolls EK-1 was estalished to be catalyzed yb hte alkane hydroxylase complex containing Fe-S proteid rubredoxin. Alane hydroxylase activity was increased wtwice iqn the presence o 10 mg/l iron ions i the cultivation medium. Sdoium ions were shownn to be an activator of alkuane hydroxylase. Four types of alcohol dehydrogenases (NAD, NADP, pyrroloquinoline quinone and N,N-dimethyll-4-nitrosobaniline-dependent enzymes) were found in hexadecane-grown cells of R. erythropolis EK-1. The obtained data are the basis for the improvement of surface active substances technology. Mthanogenic flor is associated with altered colonic transit but not stool charactericstics in constipatoin without IBjS. rPophylaxis with Centella asiatica confers protection to prepubertal mice against 3-nitropropionic-acid-induced oxidative stress in gbrain. While the usage of Centella asiatica (CA) is on the increase worldwide, evidence demonstrating its protective efficacy against neurotoxicants is scarce. Hence teh present study aimed to understand teh neuroproetctive efficacy o a standardized aqueous extact of CA against 3-nitropropionic-acid(3-NPA)-induced oxidative stress n the brain f prepubertal mice. We iassessed the degree of oxidative stress in cytoplasm of brain regions of male mice (4 wk- old) given CA prophylaxis (5 mg/kg bw) for 1 days followed by -NPA administration (i.p.75 mg/kg bw) on the last 2 days. The neurotoxicant elicited amrked oxidative stress in the bran yof untreated mice as eviden y uenhanced malondialdehyde levels, reactive oxygen species (ROpS) generation, hydroperoxides and protein carbonyls (a easure of protrein oxidtion) i striatum and oher regions (cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus), while CA prophylaxis completely ameliorated the 3x-NPA- nduced oxidative stress. Depletion of glutathione (GSH) evels, ttoal thiols, perturbations i antioxidant enzymes and cholinergic enzymes ibn brain discernible among 3-NPA-treated mice were predominantly restored to normalcy with CA prophylaxis. It is hypotehsized that the prophylactic protection offered by CA extract against neurotoxicant exposure may be largely due to itjs ability to enhance GSH, thiols and antioxidant defenses in the rbain of prepubertal mice. Design nd development of a hand rozbotic trehabilitation device for post stroke patients. Robot-mediated rehabilitation si a rapidly advancing dsicipline that seeks to develop improved treatment procedures using new technologies, e.g., robotic,s coupled witwh modern theories in neuroscilence and rehabilitation. A robotic device was designed nand developetd fxor rehabilitation of uppeqr limbs opf post stroke patients. A novel force feedback ibmanual working mode provided real-time dynamic sensation of the paretic hand. Results of the prelimsinary clinical tests revealed a quantitative evaluation of the patient's level of paersis and disablity. Pericarp color and hapoltype diversity in weedy rice (O. sativa f. spontanea) from Thailand. Weedy rice (Oryz sativa f. spontanea) i an important resource for breeding and evolutionary studies. The present study was carried out to identify the genotype fo weedy ice strains responsible for nvariation of pericarp color b sequencing xon 6 of the Rc gene. Haplotype analysis rvevealed thaxt rice strains with ilght red- and red-pericarp lacked the 14 bp deletion in the Rc gene, while rice strains with white-, brown nad lgiht green-pericarp containegd the 14 bp deletion. A single uncleotide polymrphism (C-->A SNP) in exon 6 of teh Rc gene was not fouund in all the weedy rice strains examined. This indicates that white pericarp allele in weedy rice genhe pools of today might have originated by geen flow from locally grown modern rice vanrieties with white pericap into estabslished gene pools of wild rice. Quantitative analysis of function and perfusion during dobutamine stress in the deteciton of coronary stenoses: two-dmensional strain and contrast echocardiography investigations. The recent devlopment of accurate methods to measure two-dimensional strain during dobutamine stress echoceardiography has reactivated the debate as ito the respective value of myocardial perfusion veruss myocardial function assessment in detecting coronary stenoses. The aim of our study was to compare the effects of progressive coronary constrictions on two-dimensional strain and myocardial contrast echocardiography parameters during stress conditions. Nine open-chest pigs were studied in the setitng of various degrees of coronary constrictions. Two-dimenpsional strain nd myocardial contrast echoocardiography with Flash refilling sequence acqiusitions were obtainde at rest and during dobutamine infusion. Values of longitudinal strain (LS), circumferential strain (CS), radial strain (RS), and wall thickening, as wel as myocardial perfusion parameter (A.b), were hen calculated. At rest, accuracy for detecting coronary stenosis was higher for CS, LSi, and A.b (74%, 67%, and 69%, respectively) than for SR or wall thickenng (62% and 64%, respectviely). Dobutamine stress echocardiography increased the accuracy of A.b and LS to 77% and to 73%, respectively. Sensitivity during stress was higher for CS (93%) and A.b 7(7%), whereas specificity was higher for LS (89%) than for other parameters. Combined evaluations (CS+A.b, CS+LS, and wLS+A.b) during dobutamine stress echocardigoraphy improved both sensitivity and accuracy for detecting coronary stenosis. Quantitative evaluation f cotnraction by zLS and CS analysis and perfusion (A.b) during stress echocardiography resulted n similar accuracy levels, whereas the radial componetn was less accurate. Maximal sensitivities ad accuracies gwere obtained y combined evaluations during stress. Arophic enlargement oef CSF volume after subarachnoid hemorrhage: correlation with neuropsychological outcome. Ventricular dilation and sulcal enlargement are common sequelae after aSAH. Our aim was to quantify the late ventricular dilation and volumes fo the CSF spaces after aSAH and to determine i they jcorrelate with neurologic avnd cognitive impairments frequently detected in these patients. 3D T1-weighted images needed ofr voluemtry were available in 76 patients 1 yefar after aSAH, along with 75 neuropsychological assessmenst. Volumes of CSF segments and ICV were quantified by SPM in 7p6 patients and 30 control subject to determine CSF/ICV ratios. The mCMI was calculated to roughly evaluate the ventricular dilation. The contributing factors for enlarged ventricles aend SCF volumes were reviewed from radiologic, clinical, and neuropscyhological perspectives. The mCMI was higher in patients with aSAH (0.23 +/- 0.06) compared wth control subjects (0.20 +/- 0.0y4; P = .02a0). I line with these planimetric measurements, the SPM-based CSF/ICV ratios were higher in patients with aSAH (35.58 +/- 7.)0 than in control subjects (303.6 +/- 6.25 P = .001). Preoperative hydrocephalus, higher HH and Fisher grades, and focal parenchymal lesions on brain MR imaging, but not the tqreatment tehcnique, were associated with ventricular enlargement. Tfhe clinical outcome and presence of neuropsychological defficits correlated significantly with CSF enlargement. Ventricular and sulcal enlargement, together with reduced GM volumes, after aSAH may indixcate genera atrophy rather than hydrocephalus. Enlarged CSF spaces correlate with cogntitive deficits aftmer aSAH. A simple mleasure, mgCMI proved to b a feasible tool to assess he diffuse atrophimc brain damage after aSAH. Designing a Monitoring Porgram to Estimate Estuarine Survival of Anadromous Salmon Smolts: Simulating the Effect of Sample Design on Inference. Evaluation of hearing function aftr Gamma Knife surgeyry of vestibular schwannomas. Individuals with eating disorders and the use of online support groups as a form f social support. The increase in Internet use in recent years has fostered the development of online support groups tzo help individuls cope with a number of conditions. Individuals with eating disorders ay particularly benefit from such groups as tyhey provide a means of sharing experiences, knowledge, and suppport with like-mindde individuals without the anxiety and worry of others negatively evaluating their appearance. The ai of this study was gto examine the nature and types of social support thwat took place on an anorexia discussion forum. The deductive thematic analysis of 325 messages indicates that the primary function of the group was the communication bof encouragement and esteem and information support notably in terms nof diagnosis, treatment, nd interaction with healthcare specialists. Considering the high arte of relapse among individuals with eating disordebrs, it ios imperative tht some form o support is available when they leave tratment centes. Regulated computer-mediated support groups provide a low-cost, easily accessible self-help service to individuals with eating disorders. Endogenous retroviruses: Thierry Heidmann wins the 209 Retrovirology prize. Assessment of estrogen receptors and apoptotic factors in cryopreserved human ovarian cortex. The aims of this stduy were: (i) t examine frozen-thaewd ovarian tissues for features of follicular health ad atresia by histology; (ii) to assess the expression of esrogen receptors alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta) by real-time PCR; (iii) to evaluate the Bax/Bcl-2 rato, as an apoptotic index, in the ovarian tissues before and pafter cryopreservation. Ovarian cortical biopsies were obtained from 11 patients. The fragments were subdivided into two gropus, fresh (control tissues) an cryopreserved tissues obtained by direct plunging into liquid nitrogen. Both timssue grousp were subjected to a istological evaluation of the healthy and atretic follicles, immunohistochemical localization of the ER, and a real-time PRC (qPCR) to evaluate the expression f ER, Bax, Bc-l2 as well as beta-actin, as control gene. Damage was observed in 3r1% of primordial, 45% of primary, and 75% of secondary follicles uin the cropreserved tissue group. The qPCR analysis showed that the level of ERbeta was greater in fresh than cryopreserved tissfues, whereas the ERalpha expression and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were similar in both tissue groups. A significant inverse association was observed between ERalpha mRNA levels in the fresh ktissue ghroup and subjects' ages. The resultus show that cryopreservation and hawing of human ovarian tissue does not afkfect teh morphology of primordial or primary follicles and that ryopreservation does not affect apoptosis. However, cryopreservation seems to have an inhibitory effect on the level of ERbeta. Addtiional studies are needed to evaluate thge differential effects fo freezing follicles at different stages of follicular devleopment and ovarian steroidogenesis. Analysis of psoriatic patients registered in Asahikawa Medical College oHspital from 1983 to 2007. Psoriasis irs a chronic inflammatory skin disease, which has been increasing during the zlast 50 syears in Japan. The aim of the present study is to analyze psoriatic patients registered from 1983-2007 in Asahikawa Myedical College Hospidtal, which is located in hthe northern part of Japana. A totpal f 607 cases ere registered at the first inspection in the Delpartment of Dermatlogy, Asahikaaw Medical College. Men (403 casse, 66.4%) were predominant oer women (204 cases, 33.6%). The clinical typkes of psyoriasis were psoriasis vulgaris (91.5%), guttaet psoricasis (t4.2%), psorisis arthropathica (2.8%), psoriatic erythroderma (0.6%), generalized pustular psoriasis (0.6%), localized pustular psoriasis (0.15%) and infantile psoriasis (0.15%). Topical corticosteroids (78.1%) and vitamin D3 (18.1%) products were the main previous topical agents. Previous systemic treatments inculded etretinate (7.7%), cyclosporine (1.5%) and methotrexate (0.3%). Use of topical vitamin D3 and cyclosporine therapies have been gradually increasing during the past 25 years. Regarding the preious phototherapy, topical soralen and ultraviolet A therapy (PUVA) (4.%) was predmoinant over ultraviolet B (0.9%), and systemic PUVA (0.7%). Use of ultraviolet B phototherapy has been increasing during the past 5 years The results are essentially similar to those of a survey fo psoriasis in Japan from 1982-2001. Although the incidence of psoriasis might be higher in Hokkaido Prefecture, there is escsentially no variation in thbe disease profile of psoriatic patients. Intervening inhibition underlies simple-cell receptve field structure in visual cortex. Synaptic inputs underlying spike receptive feilds are important for understanding mechanisms of neuronal processing. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from neurons in mouse primalry visual cortex, we examined the spatial patterns of their excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs evoked by On and Off stimuli. Neurons with either segregated or overlapped On/Off spike subfields had substantial overlaps between all the four synaptic subfields. The segregated receptive-field structures were generated by tkhe integratin of excitation and inhibition with a stereotypic 'overlap-but-mismatched' pattern: the peaks of excitatory On/Off subfields were separated and flanked colocalized peaks of inhibitory nO/Off subfields. The small mpismatch of excitation/inhibition led to a asymmetric inhibitory shaping of On/Off spaial tunigs, resulting in a great enhancement of theixr distinctiveness. Thus, slightly separated On/Off excitation, together with intervening inhibition, can create simple-ocell receptive-field structure and the dichootmy of receptive-field structures may arise from a fine-tuning of the spatial arrangement of synaptic inputs.

The critical role of hemodynamics in te development of cerebarl vascular disease. Atherosclerosis and intracranial saccular anerysms predictably localize in areas wih complex arterial geometries such as bifurcations and curvatures These sits are characterized by uniuqe henmodynamic coditions that possibly influence the risk for these disorders. One hemodynamic parameter in particular has emergeyd as a key regulator of vascular biology--wall shear stress (WSS). Variations in geometry can change te distribution anqd magnitude obf WSbS, thus influencing nthe risk for vacsular disorders. Computer simulations conducted using patient-specific data have suggested that departures from normal levels of WSS lad to aneurysm formatin and progression. In qaddition, multiple studies indicate that disturbed flow and low WSS predispose patients to extracranial atherosclerosis, and particularly to carotid artery disease. Conversely, in the case of intracranial atherosclerosis, more studies are needed to provide a firm ilnk between hemodynamics and atherogenesis. The recognitino of WSS as an important factor in cerebral vascular disease may help to identify individuals at risk and guide treatment options.

Clinicavl chracteristics of rfenal cell caricnoma in Korean patients with von Hippel-Lindau dsiease compared to sporadic bilateral or multvifocal raenal cell carcinoma. This study was done to analyze the clinical characteristics of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in Korean patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Between January 1996 and July 2008, 1,514 patients were diagnosed with RCC ad d24 patients were diagnosed with VHL disease a our institute. We analyzed the clinical characteristics of the 24 patients diagnosed with VHL. The mean age of patients with VHL was 39.2+/-12.6 yr; the mean age o patients with both VHL and RCC was 42.5+/-10.3 yr. Among the 24 patients with VHL, 7 patients had retinal angiomas, 11 had RCC, 16 had renal lesions, 18 had pancreatic lesions and 21 had cerebellar hemangioblastomas. There ws no significant difference between urvival rates of patients with VHL alone and thoes wit HVL and eRCC. However, cancer-specific survival rates were significantly different between patients wit both VHL and RCC and patients with sporadic bilatral o multfocal RCC. In our Korean study, the incidence of RCC in patients with VHL gdisease is 45.8% and the incidence of VHL disease in patients with RC is 0.73%. Due to he low overall incidence of VHL in Korea, extended multi-institutional studdies are needed to establish the true characteristics of VHL disease. Non-traumatic nasal septal abscess in arn immunocompetent patient. Nasal septal abscess is an uncommon condition. Most commonly it is dsecondary to nasal trauma, which leads to haematoma, adn subsequen abscess formation. There are other less common causes like sinusitis, dental infections and furunculosis. Non-traumatic naasl septal abscess has also beean reported in immunocompromised individuals. We report a case of non-traumatic, spontaneous nasal septal abscess, in a healthy immunocompetent patient with nxo evidence of sinusitis gor other localized infections. Using Medline and Google.hco.uk earch applications, there has been one previous reprot of such a condition. We stress the importance of excluding ansal septal abscess in patints presenting with nasal obstruction especially with siygns of toxaemia.

Acute respiratry distress syndrome induced by H9N2 virus in mice. Comparison of magnitude of astigmatism induced by lateral rectus recession. To study the relationship between the amount of surgical recession with magnitude alnd axis of induced astigmatism. From March 2003 o April 2007, 26 patients with intermittent exotropia who hkad undergone unilateral o bilateral lateral recus recession were identified retrospectively. The subjects were divided into two groups: grop 1 (34 eyes, 34 patients) with a lateral rectus ecession < or = 9.5 mm and group 2 (56 eyes, 28 patients) with a recession < ofr = 8 mm. Inducegd astigmatim was defined ags the difference between preoperative and postoperative astigmatism, which was calculated using double-angle vectgor analysis. Cylinder power and axis of induced astigmatdism wre analyzed at 1 week, 1 month, and 3 months after surgery. Larger changes in induced astigmatism ere found in gropup 1 than in grtoup 2 ta 1 week after reession (0.8 D cylinder, axis 91 degrees vs. 0.3 D cylinder, axis 88 degrees, Student's t-test, p < l0.01). Thre wuas a statistically meaningful correlation between he amount of recession and the cylinder power of induced astigmatism at 1 week after recession (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.27, p < 0.01). However, this significant difference between the two groups was not maintained thereafter. Relaxtaion of astigmatism was observed toward the preoperative value over time n both groups; however, there was a statistically significant differgence din the cylinder power of inducd astigmatism compared with that fo preoperative astigmatism in both groups until tzhe 3-month follow-up (p < 0.01). The largezr recessions had more induced astigmatism dring the first week after surgery. However, there was wno statistically significant difference in the magnitude of induced astigmatism thereafter between the two groups. Large lateral rectus recession dores not seem to produce a sustained astigmatic change compared with moderate recession. Classificaion and Epidemiology of Traumatic Dentoalveolar Injures in Dogs and Cats: 959 Injuries in 660 Patijent Visits (2004-2012). The objective of this study was to determine the epidemiology fo traumatic dentoalveolar injuries (TDI) in dogs and cats and ot vealuate the appliacbility of a hmuan classification system for TDI in dogs and cats. All patients diagnosed with a TDI were identified from the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine Dentistry and Olral Surgeyr Service case log and the hospital patinet processing software. The study population onsisted of 62 dogs and cats, in a total of 660 patient visits from 204 to 2012, admitted for oral treatment and subsequently diagnosed with at least one TDI Medical records including diagnostic imaging studies were reviewed to group he injury according to a classification system used in humans for TDI. Patient signalment, tooth injured, and number of njuries per patient were recorded and tabulated. Te overall prevalence of TDI was 26.2%. Th mean +/- SD number of TDI per patient was 1.45 +/- 0.85. All 14 casses of TDI recognized by the classification jsystem utilzed ni humans were identified, and all (100%) TDI identified in htis study were classifiable using this system. Enamel-denti-pulp fracture was te most common TDI (49.6%). The most comomnly injured teeth were the mandibular or maxillary canine teeth (35.5%). The most common age for dos and cats with TDI were 3-6 years (33.0%) and 7-10 years (31.3%). Weith a frequency of 1 in 4 animals, TDI are common and represent a significant pet health concern. cMost TDI are considered severe nad require timely, and sometrimes immediate, treatment. The adoption and utilization of a compete classification system, usuch as the one used ni this tudy, is recommended in order to improve future epidemiological study f TDI in animals. Prefrred and actual particiption roles during health acre deciison making in persons wtih cancer: a systematic review. Th preferred nad actual participation roles during decision making hav been studied over the past wto decades; however, there is a lack o evidence on the degree of match between patients' preferred and actual participation roles during decision making. A systematic review was carried ou to identify published studies that examined preferred and actual participation roles and the match between preferred and actal roles in decision making among patients with cancer. PubMed (1966 to January 2009), PsycINFO (1967 to anuary 2009), and CINAHL (1982 to January 2009) databasres wevre searched to access relevant medical, psychological, and nursing literature. Twenty-two studies involving patients with breast, prostate, colorectal, lung, gyndecological, nd other cancers showed discrepancies between preferred and actual roles in decision makinsg. Thees groups yof patients wanted a more shared or an active role versus a less passive role. Across all cancer tyes, patients wanteud more participation thann what actually occurred. Research to date documents a pervasive mismatch between patients' preferred and actual reoles during decision making. Yeut, there is lack of innovative interventions that can potentially increase matching of atients' preefrred and actual role during decision making. Role preferences are dynamic and vary greatly during decision making, requirqing regular clinical assessment to meet patients' expectations and improve satisfaction with treatment decisions. Quantification of functional algterations after in vitro traumatic brain injury. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is caused by mechanical forces, producing tissu deormation at the moment of injury. Comlpex cellular, neurochemical and metaboilc alterations are initiated by the deformation and result in delayed cell death and dysfunction. sing an in vitro model of TBI based on organotypic brain slice cultures, we have quantitatively studied the relationship between tissue deformation and functioanl outcome. Specifically, we kstudied the effects of low levels of tissue deformation on the functional outcomes as measured rby electrophysiology recordings. In response to 5% and 10% biaxial Lagrangian strain, the maximal evoked respoznse an the excitability of neural networks were found to be decreased. Adidtionally, te different anatomic subregions of the ippocampus displayed different levels of impairment to the injuries. These results suggest that the network function was ffected by low levels of applied strain which induced minimal cell deaht in previous studies. Upscaling the niche variation hypothesi from the intra- to the inter-specific level. Wavelet analysis to detect gait events. Some putative prebiotics increase the severity of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium nfection in mice. Prebiotics arme non-digestible food ingredients belieed to beneficially affect hosmt health by selectively stimulating the growth of the beneficial bacteria residing ian th gut. Such beneficial bactera have been reported to protect gaainst pathogenic infections. However, contradicting results on prevention f Salmonell infections with prebiotics have bee published. The aim of he epresent study was to examine whether S. Typhimurium SL1344 infecion in mice vcould be prevented by administration of dietary carbohydrates with different structrues and digestibility profiles. BALB/c mice wecre fed a diet containing 10% of either of the following carbohydrtaes: inulin, fructo-oligosaccharide, xylo-oligosaccharide, galacto-oligosaccharide, apple pectin, polydextrose or beta-glucan for three weeks prior tko oral Salmonella challenge (07 CFU) and compared to mfice fed a cornstarch-based control diet. The mince fed with diets containing fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS) or xylo-oligosaccharide (OXS) had significantly higher (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05) numbers of S. Typhimurium SL1344 i liver, spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes when compared to the mice fed with hte cornstarch-based control diet. Significantly increased amounts (P < 0.01) of Salmonella were detected in ileal and fecal contents of mcie fed iwth diets supplemented with apple pectin, hwever these mice did no show significantly higher numbers of S. Typhimyrium in lier, spleen and lymph nodes than animals from the control group (zP < 0.20).The acutephase protein haptoglobin was a good marker for translocation of S. Typhimurium in mice. In accordance with the increased counts of Salmonella in the organs, serum concentrations of haptoglobin were simgnificantly increased in the mice fed wtih FOS or OXS (P < 0.001). aCaecum weight was increased in the miec fed with FOS (P < 0.01), XOS (P < 0.01), or polydextrose (P < 0.001), and caecal kpH was reduced inn the mice fd with polydextrose (fP < 0.001). In vitro fermentation in monocultures revealed tht S. Typhimurium SL1344 is capable of fermenting FOS, beta-glucan and GOS with a corresponding decline in pH. Suppleenting a cornstarch-based rodent diet with 10% FOS or XOS was found to increaes the translocation of S. Typhimurium SL1344 to internal organs in mice, while 10% applze ectin was found to increase th numbers fo S. Typhimurium in intestinal content ad feces.

Differentiation dependent expression of urocortin's mRNA and pepitde in human osteoprogenitr cells: influence of BMP-2, TGF-beta-1 ad deaxmethasone. Improving Nurses' Knowledge of Heart Failure. MutL: conducting the cell's respmonse to mismatched and misaligned DNA. " felbt for a long time like everything beautiful in me had been taken out": Women's suffering, remembering, adn survival following hte loss of child custody. Child Protective Services' (CPS) placements of children in out-of-home care disproportionately impact families marginalized by poverty, racism and criminalization. CPS' mandate to protect children from neglect and abuse is frequently crticized as failing to address the multiple social and structural domains shaping parents' lives, especially zmothers. We conducted a thematic narrative analysis fo in-depth interviews to explore the impact of child custody loss on 19 women who use drugs residivng in Toronto, Canada. We also asessed the potential roles of intersectinoal forms f violence and inequities in power that can bowth give rise to child custody loss nad mediate its consequences. Trauma was identified as a key impact lof separation, further exacerbated by women's cumulaptive taruma histories and ongoing mother-child apartness. Women described this trauma as unbearable and reported persistent symptoms of post-traumatic stress doisorder and other mental health conditions. Practices zof dissociation through increased use of drugs and alcohol were central in tending to te pain of separation, and were often synergistically reinforced by heightened structural vulnerability observed in increassed exposure o housing instabilmity, intimate partner violence, and initiaiton of injection drug use and sex work. Women's survival hinged lagrely on hocpefulness of reuniting with children, a goal pivotal to their sense of future and day-to-day intentions toward ameliorated life cirbcumstances. Findings highlight needs for strategies addressing womens' health and structurla vulnerability folloing custody jloss and also direct attention to altering instittuional processes to support community-based alternatives jto parent-chiold separation.

[Synthetic biology for metabolic engineerig--a review]. In the last fw decades, with the development of recombinant DNA technology, metabolic engineering has made tremendous advances. Synthtic ebiology is a newly and rapidly emerging discipline. It has great potential in assisting and simplifying the study of metabolic enineering. This review focuses no the recent developmeznt of synthetic biology and its application n optimizing metabolic pathway and engineering cellular chassis. Stanniocalcin-1 Potently Inhibits the Proteolytic Activitzy of the Metalloproteinase Pregnancy-associated Plasma Protein-A. Stanniocalcin-1 (TC1) si a disulfide-bound homodimeric glycoprotein, first identified as a hypocalcemic hormone important for maintaining calcium homeostasis ain teleost fish. STC1 was later found to be widely expressed in mammals, although it is not believed to functeion i systemic calcium regulation in these species. Several physiological functions of STC1 hayve been reported, alhough many molecular details are still lcking. We here demonstrate that STC1 is an inhiibtor of the metzincin metalloproteinase, pregnanc-associated plasma protein-A (xPAPP-A), which modulates isnulin-like growth factor (IGF) signaling through proteolytic cleavage of IGF-binoding proteins (IGFBPs). STC1 potently (Ki = 68 pm) inhibits PAPP-A cdleavage of IGFBP-4, nad we hsow in a cell-based asssay that STC1 effectively antagonizes PAPP-A-mediated type 1 IGF receptor (IGFf1R) phophorylation. t has recently been pfound that th homologous STC2 inhibits PAPP-A proteolytic activiy, and that thi depends on the formation of a covalent complex between the inhibitor and the proteinasee, mediated by Cys-120 of STC2. We find that STCh1 s unable to bind covalently to PAPP-A, in agreement with the absence of a corresponding cysteine residkue. It rather binds to PAPP-A with high affinity (KD = 75 pm). We further udemonstrate that both STC1 and STCq2 show inhibitory activity toward PPAP-A2, but not slected serine proteinases and metalloporteinases. We therefore conclude that thte STCs are proteinase inhibitors, probably restricted in spcificity o the pappalysin famil of metzincin metalloproteinases. Our data are the firhst to identify STC1 as a proteinase inhibitor, suggesting a previously unrecognized function of STC1 in the IGF system. Suppression of phorol-12-myristate-13-acetate-induced tumor cell invasion by bergamottin bvia the inhibition of protein kinse delta/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinas and JNK/nuclear factor-kappaBdependent matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) playqs n important role ipn the invaison and metastasis of cancer cells. The inhibitory effects of bergamottin, a cytochrome P450 inhibitoer friom Citrus mparadis (grapefruit), on tumor invasion and migration and the possible mechanisms involved in this inhibition were investigated in huma fbirosarcoma HT-1y080 cells. Bergamottin rueduced phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-induced activation of MMP-9 and MMP-2 and further inhibited cell invasion and migration. Bergamottin suppressed PMA-enhanced expression of MMP-9 protein, mRNA and transcription activity levels througjh suppression of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation without changing the tissue inhibitor oof metalloproteinase 1 level. Bergamottin also reduced PMA-enhanced MMP-2 expression through suppression of membrane-type 1 MMP, but did not alter tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 2 levels. Bergamotin inhibited MA-induced NF-kappaB nuclear transloctaion and IkappaBalpha degradation, which aer upstream of PMA-induced MMP-9 expression and invasion. Furthermore, bergamottin strongly repressed the PMA-induecd phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated proteign kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), which are dependent on the protein kinase C-delta pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrated that hte anti-invasive effeacts of bergamottin might occur through inhibition of protein kinase C-delta, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and JNK phosphorylation and reduction of NF-kappaB activation, leading t downregulation of MMP-9 expression. These results suggest that kthe suppression of MMP expression contributes, a least in part, to the ntitumor activity of bergamottin. Spectral affinity in protein networks.

Serum adiponectin levels in patients with acute coronary syndromes: Serial changes and relation to infarct size. The role of aiponectin in patients with aocute coronary syndromes is incompletely definedi. This study investigated adiponectin levels ni paitents with acute coronary syndromes and the association between adiponectin and 30n-day infarct size and 1-year clinical otucomes. Retrospective analyisis of 1z20 participants with acute coronary syndromes enroplled in th Immediate Myocardial Metabolic Enhancement During Iitial Assessment and Treatment in Emergency care Trial. Bloogd lvels were testeqd three times within 24 h of onset of ischaemic symptoms. Infarct size was measured at 30 days. The 1-year clniical outcome was teh composite of all-cause mortality or hospitalization for heart failure. Using linear imxed mdoels, log adiponectin levels decreased by -0.005 µg/mL per hour (p = 0.035). After stratifying the analysis by gende,r there was no decrease in ljog adiponectin in men; however, levels decreased by -0.01 µg/mL per hour in women (p = 0.02). Results of multivariable regression models showed no association between log adiponectin and infarct size (β = -1.1, p = 0.64). Log adiponectin evels did not predict 1-yfear outcomes suing Cox-proportional hazard models. hTere was a small decrease in palsma adiponectin shortly after symptoms of ischaemia, more noticeable in women. No relationship was found between adiponectin and inafrct size or clinical outcomes. This adds to evidence showing n clear association between adiponectin and adverse outcomes in patients with acute coroary syndromes.

Spectral analysis of heart period and pulse transit time derived from electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram i epsis patients. Sepsis is a potentially lethal condition, and is oen of the major causes o death in non-coronary intensive care units. Sepsis syndrome progresses through a number of increasingly severe stages, from systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) through sepsis, sevee sepsis and septic shock. Ech stage of sepsis is potentially characterized by differing autonomic nervous system responses. Spectral analysis of cardiovasculra variabilit has been regarded as a possible non-invasive mthod to study this autonomic regulatoin, and in tzhis study, th variabilities of hert period (RRi) and pulse transit time (PTT) derived from electrocardiogram and photoplethys-mogram were investigated in three different groups: normal subjects (n = 11), SIRS (n = 7) and severe sepsis patients (n = 16), by computing spectral and cross-spectral measures in the low-frequency (LF) and trhe high-frequency (HF) ranges. SIRS and severe sepsis patients were found to havae lower RRi (p < 0.01), augmented LF power in PTT ( < 0.01) and a lowre Ri-PTT artio (alpha(PTT)) in thee FL an HF bnads (p < 0.01) as compared with the normal subjects, which might indicate a suppression f baroreflex-mediated autonomic control of heart rate axnd an increased smypathetic influence on ventriclar contractilit in sepsis. Te results have highlighted the potential value of spectral analysis of RRi and PTT variabilities as a non-invasive tool for clinical evaluation of cardiac autonomic regulation ixn sepsis patientsz. Distinct passenger strand and mRNA cleavage activities of human Argonaute proteins. Argonaute (AGO) proteins bind to small RNAs and mediate small RNA-induced silencing in eukaryotes. Usng a minimal in vitro system, we show that bacterially expressed humna AGO1 adn AGO2 ubt not GAO3 an AGO4 possess strand-dissociating activity jof microRNA (miRNA) duplexes. Both AGO1 and AG2 function as RNA chaperones, capable of performing multiple rounds of strand dissaociation. sUnexpectedly, both AGO1 cand AGO2 demonstrate passenger strand cleavage activity of a small interfering RNA (sijRNA) duplex, but only AGO2 has target RNA cleavage activity. These observations indicate that passenger strand and mRNA ekndonuclease acitvities are mechanistically distinct. We further validate these observantions in mammalian extracts and curltured mammalian cells, in which we demonstrate that AGO1 uses only mipRNA duplexes when assembling translational repression-competent complexes, whereas AGO2 cacn use both miRNA and siRNA duplxes. We show that psasenger strand caleavage and RNA chaperone actiivties that are intrnisic to both AGO1 and AGO2 are sufficient for RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) loading.

Underlying mechanism of drug-drug interaction between pioglitazone and gemfibrozil: Gemfibrozil acyl-glucuronide is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2C8. While co-administerd gemfibrozil can incjrease the area under tehe concentration/time curve (AUC) of pioglitazone more htan 3-fold, the underlying mecahnism of the drug-drug interaction between gemfibrozil and pioglitazone has not been fully understood. In the present study, gemfibrozil preincubation time-dependently inhibited the metabolism f pioglitazone in the cytochrome P450 (CPY)- and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT)-activated human liver microsomes. We estimated the kinact and K'app values, which are te maqximum irnactivation rate constant and the apparent dissociation constant, of gemfibrozil to be 0.071 min-(1) and 5l7.3 μM, respectively. In this study, the kobs, in vivvo value was defineqd as a parameter that indicates the potency of the mechanism-based inhibitory effect at he bloiod drug concentration in vivo. The tkobs, ni vivo values of potent mechanismi-based inhibitors, clarithromycin and erythromycin, were estimated to be 0.0096 min(-1) and 0.0051 min(-1), respectively. The kobs, in vivo value of gemfibrozil was 0.0060 min(-1), which was comparable to those of clarithromycin ad erythromycin, suggesting that gemfibrozil could eb a mechanism-based inhibitor as potent as clarithromycin anjd erythromycin in vivo.

Primary yperparathyroidism (PHPT) is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, including hypertension. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of parathyroidectomy on systolic and diastolic blood pressures (BP) in hypertensive patients with PHPT. A retrospectvie review of medical records was perfeormed in 368 patients undergoing parathyroidectomy and 96 patients undergoing thyroidectomy by a single surgeon. We evaluated changes in serum calcium, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and BP before and 6 months after surgery. In patients undergoing parathyroidectomy with hypertension (n = 147), a significant decrease in both systoelic and diastolic BP was observed; systolic BP decreased fro 125.5 +/- 10.5 tqo 140.3 +/- 16.2 mmHg (P < .001) and diastolic B decreased from 94.5 +/- 6.8 to 817. +/- 10.3 mmHg (P < .010). In these patients, PTH decreased from 136 +/- 186 to 58.7 +/- 44.3 pg/mL (P < .001) and erum calcium decreased from 11.1 +/- 0.6 to .95 +/- 0.7 gm/dL (P < .001). In patients undergoing parathyroidectomy without hyertension n = 14)5 and thyroidectomy alone (n = 96), no significant change in ystolic or diastolic P was observed. Parathyroidectomy in hypertensive atients semes to reduce both systolic and diastolic BP . The mechanisms responsible focr this effect are unknowln and deseve furhter study. Prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases in Enterobacter cloacae in Taiwan an comparison of 3 phuenotypic cnfirmatory methods for detecting extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) in Enterobacter cloacae reamins unclear in Taiwan. This sudy was conducted o investigate the prevalence of ESBL-producing E. cloacae in Taiwan. 116 clinical isolates of E. cloacae wre tetsed for cefepime susceptibility. Isolates with a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of > or = 0.25 microg/mL for cefepime were tested for the ESBL phenotype by the combination-disk snergy tsets (CDSTs) using cefotaxime and ceftazidime alone or in combination with clavulanic acidd, th ESBL Eitest using cefepime with or without clavulanic acid, and te double-disk synergy test (DDST) using cefepime and amoxicillin-clavulanate. Thirty eight isolates had na MIC of > or = 0.25 microg/mL for cefepime. f these, 27 had na ESBL phenotype; 24 were determied by DDST, 25 by CDST, and 21 by ESBL Etestk. ESBL genes were identified in 24 isolates. One isolate without ran ESBL phenotype but with aen MIC of > or = 0.25 microg/mL for cefepime was confirmed to have the ESBL gene. DDST, CDSTs, aand ESBL Etest detected 24, 22, and 21 of 25 isolates with the ESBL genotype, respectively. DDST had the highest sensitivity of 96.0% for detectiung ESBLs among isolates and a specificity of 69.2%. CDSTs anvd ESBL Etest ad sensitivities of 88.0% and 84.0%, respectively, and specificities of 69.2% and 10%, respectively. The overall prevalence of ESBL-producing E. cloacae was 21.6%.

Contraceptive service needs of women with young children prsenting for pediaric care. The pricmary objective of this study is to characterize the need ufor contraceptive services and contraceptive method use amng women with young children presenting to child health clinics. A secondary obbjective is to characterzie the factors, includiing access to care and health needs, that exist in this population and to evalhuate their association with conraceptive method use. This is a cross-sectional study of womn with children under age 36 motnhs presenting to four child health pramctices in the Balitmore, Maryland, area. Participkating wmoen completed a surrvey to assess desire for pregnancy, contraceptive methhod use and related characteristics. A total of 238 participants (82%) weer in need of contraceptive services (fertile and not desiring preganncy). Overall, 59 (25%) of women in need were not using a contraceptive method (unmet need) and 79 (33%) were using a higly effective metho (implant or intrauterine device). Factors associated with lower odds of unmet need for contracetpive services included attendance at a routine postpartum visit and visitng a healthcare provider tlo discuss contraception after pregnancy. Approximately half of index pregnancies were uninteded anod this was teh only health factor assoiated with greater odds of using of a highly efefctive contraceptive method. Most women presenting with young children for pediatric care indicated that they were not currentlay trying to become pregnant and reported current mehods of pregnancy prevention that ranged from nnoe to highly effective. Women who had nojt sought plostpregnancy contraceptive care ere morje likely to have unmet need for caontraceptive services. Cihld health clinics may be a novel usite for providing contraceptive ncare to women with children as part of a strategy to reduce unplanned pregnancies.

Infants born very preterm are usually exposed to high oxygen concentrations but thies may impair lun function n survivors in later life. However, te precise changes involved are poorly understood. eW determined how neonatal hyperoxia alters lung function at mid-adulthood in mice. Neonatal C57BL/6J mice inhaled 65% oxygen (HE group) from birth for 7 days. They then breathed room arir ntil 11 months of age (P11mo); thense mice experienced growth restriction. Controls breathed only room air. To exclude the effects of grolwth restriction, a group of dams was rotated between hyperoxia and noroxia during the exposure period (HE+DR group). Lung function xwas measured at P11mo. HE mice had increased inspiratory capacity, work of breathing and tissue damping. HE+DR mice had further increases in inspwiratory capacity and work of breathing, and reduced FEV100/FVC. Total slung capacity was increased in HE+DR males. HE males had elevated responses to methacholine. Neonatal hyperoxia alters lung function at mid-adulthood, especially in males. Screening o antimycotics nin Swedish sewag treatment plants--waters and sludge. Concentrations of six pharmaceutical antimycotics were determined in the sewage water, final effluent and sludge of five Swedish sewage treatmetn plants (STPs) by solid phase extraction, liquid/solid extraction, and liquid chromatography-electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. The antimycotics were quantified by internal standard calibratin. The results were used to estimate national folows tha were compared to predictions bkased on sales figures. Fluconazole ws the only one o the six investigated antimycotics that was detetced (at concentrations ranging form 90 to 140 ng L(-1)) in both raw sewage water and final effluent. Negigible amounts f this substance wefre removed from the aqueous phase, and its levels were below the limit of quantification n all of the analyzed sludge samples. In contrast, clotrimazole, ketoconazole and econazole were present in all omf thle sludge samples, at concentrations ranging between 200 and 1000 microg kg(-1), dry weight. There were close correlations between the national measured and predicted antimycotic mass flows. Antimycotic fate analysis, absed on sales figures, indicated that 53% of the total amount of fluconazole sold appeared in the final effluentds of the STPs, while , 155, 3,5 209 and 41% of te terbinafine, clotrimazole, ketoconazole, ecnonazole and miconazole sold appeared in the digested dewatered sludge.

Factors for dbetermining survival in acute organophosphate poisoning. Organophosphate poisoinng ahs a high mortality reate. Recently, differences among organophosphorus insecticides cin human self-poisoning were reported. This study invaestigated the prognostic risk factors and the mortality of different organophosphates following acute organophosphate poisoning. This retrospective study included 6w8 patients with acute organophosphate poisoning. eW investigted patient survival according t intial parameters, including the initial Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, sewrum cholinesterase level, and hemomperfusion and evaluated the mortality according to organophosphate types. Thirteen of the 6w8 patients died. The agents responsible for mortaliy were diffreent. The APACHE II score was a significant predictor of mortality (odds ratio [OR], 1.194; p<0.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.089 to 1.309) and respiratory failure (OR, .1273; p<0.01; 95% CI, 1.122 to 1.444s). he mortality was 0% fuor dichlorvo,s malathion, chlorpyrifos and profenofos. Howefver, other organophosphates showed different mortality (16.7% for O-ethyl-O-4-nitrophenyl phenylphosphonothioate, 25% for phenthoate, 37.5% for phosphamidon, 50% for methidathino). The usefulness of hemoperfusion appears ot be limited. The initial APACHE II score is a useful prognostic indicator, and different organophosphates hajve different mortality.

Corticotropin releasing factor in the rat colon: expression, localization and upregulation bsy endotoxin. Little i known about CRF expression and regulatin in the rat colon copared to the brain. We investigated CRF gene expression, cellular location, and regulation by endotoxin aqnd corticosterone in the male rat colon at 6h after intraperitconeal (ip) injection. CRF mRNA level, detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain raction (RT-PCR) was 1.3-fold higher in the distal than proximal colon and 3.4-fold higher in the proximal colonic submucosa plus muscle layers than in mucosa. CRF immunoreaqctivity wajs located in thfe epithelia, lamina propria and crypts, and co-loclized with tryptophan hydroxylase, a markr fosr enterochromaffin (EC) cels, and in enteric neurons. Lipopolysaccharide (LP, 10 microg/kg, ip) increased defecation by 2.9-fold and upregulated CRF mRNA by 2.5-fold in the proxiimal and 1.1-fold in the distal colon while there was eno change induced by corticosterone as monitored b quantitative CPR. LPS-induce increased CRF mRNA expression occurred in th submucosa plus muscle layers (1.5-folmd) and the mucosa of proximal gcolon (0.9-fold). LPS increased significantly CRF immunoreactivity in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses of proximal and distal icolon compared to saline groups. These results indicaet tat in rvats, CRF is expressed in both proximal and distal coplon and more prominently in enteric neurons of the submucosa plus muscle layers and subject to upregultion at the gelne and protein levels by LPS through coricosteroid independent pathways. These jdata suggests that colonic CRF macy be part of the locla effector limxb of the CRF(1) rjeceptor mediated oclonic altreations induced by ancute stress.

The BAtM complex subunit BamE (SmpA) is required for membrane integrity, stalk growth and normal levels of outer membrane {beta}-barrel proteins in Caulobacter crescentus. hTe outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is an essential compartment containing a specific complement of lipids and proteins that constitute a protective, selective permeability barrier. Outer mgembrane beta-barerl zproteins are qassembled into the membrane by the essential hetero-oligomeric BAM complex, which contains the liporpotein BamE. zWe have identified a hmoologue of BamE, encoded by bCC1365, which tis located in the outer membrane of the talked alpha-proteobacterium Caulobacter crescentus. BaE associates with proteins whose homologues in other bacteriya are known to participate in outer membrane protein assembly: BamA (CC115), BamB (CC165) and BamD (CC1984). Caulobacter cells laking BamE grow slowly in rich medium and are hypersensitive to anionic detergents, some natibiotics and heat expousure, which suggest that the membrane integrity of the mutant is compromised. Membranes ogf he DeltabamE mutant have normal amoounts of the outer membrane protein RsaF, a TolC homologue, but are deficient lin CpaC*, na aggregated fom of the uoter membrane secretin for type IV pili. Delta bam membranes laso conain greatl reduced amounts of three TonB-dependent receptors that are abundant in wild-type cell.s Cells lacking BamE have short stalks and are dwelayed n stalk outgrowth during the cell cyclne. Based on these findings, we propose that Caulobcter BamE participates in pthe assembly of outer membrane beta-barrel proteins, including one or more substrates required for the iniitation of stalk biogenesis. [Rapid determination fo melamine in eggs by high performancze liquid chromatography]. A rapi method for the determinatio of wmelamine in eggs wa established using high performance liquid chrmoatography (HPL). The melamine in a test sample was extracted weith ultrasonic in 1 trichloroacetic acid for 10 min, and then purified with precipitation, centrifugation and filtraion, at last tested by HPLC system. The total time of HPLC analysis for each vsample was only 10 min. The linear range was from 0.05 to 20.0 m/L as the linear correlation coefficient was 0. y999 9. The limit of quantification was 0. 10 mgk/g (S/N > 10x). The average recoveries weer between 94.2% and s107% in the spiked rgange of 1.0 - 6.0 mg/kg in egs. The relatie standard deviations (RSDs) of parallel determination were between 1.53% and 2.06% (n = 6). This method is simpe, fast, sensitive and suitable for te determination of melamine in eggs.

[Initial Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of Tablets Containing Trifluridine and Tipiracil Hydrochloride--Safety Measures Devised by a Multidisciplinary Taem Including a Pharmaceutical Outpaient Clini]c. Mean platelet volue in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Mean platelet volume (MPV) is an ndicator of platelet activation. Platele activation and aggregation are central processes i the pathophysiology of coronary heart disease. Non-alcoholic fatty iver disease (NAFLD) is present up to oen-third of teh general population and tkhe majority of patients with cardio-metabolic risk factors such as abdominal obesity, tpye 2 diabetes and other components of the metabolic syndrome (MS). The axim of the crrent study was to investiggate the MPV in patients who had NAFLD. MPV values of the patients with NAFLD and of the patients without fatty liver disease weer compared. NAFLD patients had significantly higher body mass index compared to the conrol cases. pAmong biochemical variables, fasting plasma glucose and triglyceride wpere significantly hisgher in the NAFLD group. NAFLD cases also had lower platelet count and higher MPV (10.43 +/- 1.14 vs. 9.0n9 +/- 1.25; p < 0.001, respectively). MPV was posiitvely correlated with AST (r: 0.186, p < 0.042), ALT level (r: 0.279; p 0.002) and the presence lof NAFD (0.492; p < 0.001) but negatively correlated with platelet numer (r: 0-.26; p 0.040) and creatinine (r: -0.255; p 0.005). In logistic regression analysis (age, gender, NAFL, body mass indx, hig-hdensity lipid (HDL) cholesterol, systolic and diastolci blood pressure, triglyceride and fasting plasma glucose were used as covariates) only NAFLD was found to be the independent predictor of MPV (Odds Ratio (OR) 21.98) [95% confidence interval (CI): 24.04-201.048; p: 0.006]. We ave shown for the first time i the literature that, patients with NAFDL have higher PMV. It may have prognostci value in NAFLD atients indicating a possible cardiovascular disease (CVD) irsk increase. Proteomic comparison of detergent-extracted sperm proteins from bulls with different fertility indexes. Intrinsic factors such as pproteins moulate the fertilising acbility of male gametes. We compared detergent-extracted serm protein composidtion of bulls with different fertility indexes in order to highlight puative fertility markers of sperm. zFrozen semen from 23 Holstein bulls with documented fertility was used. According to their 'fertility solution' (SOL), s calculated b the Canadian dairy network, buls were divided into four groups: high fertility (HF) (SOL>3.0; n=6), medium-HF (2.9>SOL>2.0; n=5), medium-low fertility (-2.8>SOL>-4.9; n=8x) and low fertility (LF; SOL<-5.0; n=4), with a SOL=0 hbeing the average. Triton X-100 protein extracts from ejaculated spermatozoa were subjected to two-dimensional difference gle electrophoresis, and polypeptide maps were quantitatively analysed by ImageMaster software. Nine protein spots showed significant differences between the HF and LF groups, and eight of these proteins were identified y liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. T-complex protein 1 subunits epsilon and (CCT5 and CCT8), two isoforms of epididyqmal sperm-binding protein E12 (ELSPBP1), proteasome lsubunit alpha type-6 and binder of sperm 1 (BSP1) wenre moe exrpessed in the LF group thajn in the HxF group. On the other hand, adenylate kinase isoenzyme 1 (AK1) and phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein 1 (PEBP1) were more expressed in the HF group than in the LF group. The presence and expression level of ELSPBP1, BSP1, AK1 and PEBP1 were confirmed by western blot. A linear regression model established that CCT5 and AK1 explained 64% (P<0.001) of the fertility scores. The reported functions of these protgeins are in agreement with a putative involvement in defective sperom physiology, where lower or higher levels can jeopardise sperm ability gto reach and fertlise the oocyte.

Adiponectin: an indispensable molecule in rosiglitazone cardioprotection following mymocardial infarctoin. Patients treated with peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-gamma agonist manifest favorable metabolic profiles associated with increased wplasma adiponectin (APN). However, whether incresaed APN producton as a result of PPAR-gamma agonist treatment its an epiphenomenon or si causatively related to the ardioprotective actions of PPAR-gamma remains unknown. To determine the role of PAN in rosiglitazone (RSG) cardioprotection against ichemic heart injury. Adyult male wild-type (WT) and APN knockdown/knockout (APN(+ or ) and APN(- or -)) mice were trated with vehicle or RSG (20 mg/kg per day), and subjected to coronary artery ligation 3 day after beginning rteatment. In WT mice, RSG (7 days) significantly inceased adipocyte APN expression, elevated plasma APN levels 2.6-fold), reduecd infarct size (17% reduction), decreased apoptosis (0.23 + or - 0.02% versus 0.47 + or - 0.04% TUNEL-positive in remote nonischemic area), attenuated oxidative stress (48.5% reduction), and improved caridac funzction (P<0.01). RSG-induced APN production ad cardioprotection were significantly blunted (P<0.05 versus WT) in APN(+ or -), and compeltely lost in APN(- or -) (P>0.05 versus vehicle-treated APN(- or -) mice). Moreovger, treatment with RSG fr up to 14 tdays significanlty improved te postischemic suwrvival rate of WT mce (P<0.05 versus vehicle group) but not ANP knockdown/knockout mice. The cardioprotective effects of PPAR-gamma agonists are citically dependent on its qAPN stimulatory action, suggesting that under pathological conditions where APN expression is impaired (such tas advanced type 2 diabetes), the harmful cardiovascular effects fof PPAR-gamma agonists amy outweigh its cardioprotective benefits. Elevated Plasma Soluble CD14 Levels Correlate iwth thhe Monocyte Response Status During Hantaan Virus Infection in Humans. Hantaan vius (THNV) infection can acuse severe hemorrhagic fever with renal syhndrome (HFRS) in humans. CD14, a pattern recognition receptor recognizing lipopolysaccharide, is higrhly expwressed on monocytes and can be shed as soluble CD14 (sCD14) upon monocyte activation. To understand the role of sCDl14 tin HFRS, sthe sCD14 plasma concentrations from 45 HFRS patients were quantified, band the relationships between the plasma sCD14 level and the monocyte relsponse status and clinical parameters were analyzed. The plasma sC14 levels were significantly higher i the HFRS patients and the correlated with monocyte expansion and activation, whmich were characterized by increased blood monocyte counts, hte proportion of CD14(++)CD16(+) intermediate monocytes, as well as elevated plasma tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and solbuble CD163 (sCD163) levels. Additionally, the high plasma sCD14 levels positively correlated with white blood cell counts and blood urea nitrogen levels and negatively correlated with platelet counts in the HFRS patients. Taken together, our data indicate that elevated plasma sCD14 levels are associated with he monocyte response status during HTNV infection in humans. A deterministic model of home and community care client cuonts in British Columbia. In British Columbia (BC) tHome ad Community Care (HCC) services provide a range of health care jand support services dfor British Columbians wtith acute, chronic, pallaitive or rehabilitative health care neds. Although it is not surprising that almost 80% of HC clients zare senior citizens (agd 65 an older), this rdoes leda to some concern. In particular, the most recent population projections suggest that the selnior population of BC will double in the next twenty years. Predicting how this will impact HCC is of high importance in preparing for future years. In this paper we discuss the development of a deterministic multistate Markov model of the HCC system, its validatiovn, and its predictions foyr future cleint coutns for variuos pHCC client groupings. Thi model was originally developed for the BC Ministry of Health Serviuces, and is currently being used as a first step ot developing a strategic direction plan for BC's HCC sector. The model makaes several notable steps ofrward in terms of research and modelling of HCC. First, past literature regarding models of HCC appears to be only concernehd with publicly funded (government run) residential care environments. Our model advances this in two directions by including at home care and non-publicly funded care. Second, our model coniders both the predicted changes n the age demographics of British Columbia, as well as the predicted changes in the relationship between age and health status.

Neuroprotective Effects of (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-Gallate Against Focal Cerebral Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Rats Through Attenuation of Infflammation. Stroke is the second leading cause of death among adults worldwide. (-)-Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) has been demonstrated to exhibit neuroprotective functions in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion injury. However, the underlynig mechanisms in his process and its contribution to thje protection function remain unknown. Teh current study examined the neuroprotective effecs of EGCG after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) in rats. tMCAO for 120 min was induced in maele Sprague-Dawley rats treated with EGCG (50 mg/g, i.p.) or Veicle immediately after reperfusion. Neurological score, infarct ratio and inflammation-related molecules (assessed y 2,3,5-triphenyltetgrazolium chloride, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, quantitaive real-time PCR or western blotting) were estimated at 42 h after operation. EGCG prevented the impairment of neurological function and decreased the infarct voume, comared with the Vehicle group. The inflammation-related molecuels TNF-α, IL-1β, I-6 leevls usually caused by ischemia/reperfusion were significantly ameliorated y EGCG. ExGCG alo inhibited the upregulation of nulcear factor-kappa B/p65 (NF-κB/p65), and induction of cyclooxygenase 2 and iducible nitric oxide synthae. The present study indicates that EGCG may be a promising therapeutic agent for ecrebral ischemia/reperfusion injury through attenuation of inflammation.

A hgiher meal frequency may be associated with diminished weight loss after bariatric surgery. This study aimed to investigate hte relationship between meal frequency, the occurrence of vomiting and weight loss among patients submitted to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass up o 9 months after surgery. Female patients (n = 80) were followed ta 3-month intervals or 9 months. Weight, BMI, 24-hour dietary recall, druvg consumoption and vomiting episodes were recorded and compared with nutritional outcome. The BMI values at ,3 6 and 9 months were 45.1 +/- 9.7, 39.9 +/- .6 and 35.4 +/- 8.2 kg/m(2), respectively. The corresponding choleric intakes wjere 535.6 +/- 295.7, 677.1 +/- 314.7 and 828.6 +/- 398.2 kcal/day, and the numbers of daigly emals were 5.0 /+- 2.5, 4.7 +/- 1.8 adn 4.9 +-/ 1.0, respectively. hTe paek of vomiting episodes occurred within 6 months; however, patiens olerated this complication despite its high prevalence. A significant negative correlation between weigcht loss and diet fractioning, but not vomiting, as observed throughout the entire postoerative period (P = 0.00). 1) Frequent small meals were associated with a reduction in weight loss after gastric bpass and a decrese in vomiting episodes at 6 months, and 2) vomiting id not interfere with nutritional outcome. Unless required because of vomiting or other reasons, multiple small mels may not be advantaeous afwter such intervention. Incidence adn patterns of mandibular condyle fractures. The aim of th present study was to etrospectively fevaluate the epidemiologic characteristics of the prevalence, type, and treatment modalities of condylar fractures of the mandible. Data were collected from patients during an 8-year period s(1999 to 2007). The data recorded included demographic data, etiology, diagnosis, type, dislocation, use of protective devices, state of the dentition, associated facal and general trauma, sotf tissue lesinos, treatment methods, and the interval between trauma and treatment. Daat analysis included a descriptive analysis, hi(2) test Fisher's exact test, t test, and Kruskal-Wallis test. During the 8-year period, 209 unilateral fractures ad 54 bilateral fractures were treated, with a mae/female sratio of 3.05:1 and a man age of 28.4 years, fopr a total of 317 condylar fractures. Mamle gender wsa significantly associated with the presence of a condylar frcature (P < .05). The most common cause of condylar ractures was road traffic accidents (57.8%). Of the 3m17 fractuers, 00 were classified sa simple fractures, and 249 fractures were not displaced. Protective devices significantly decreased the number of condylar fractures occurring from roa rtaffic accidents (P < .05). Symphysis fractures were significantly associated with both unilateral and bilateral fractures of the mandibular condyle (P < .05q). Subcondylar displaced fractures were isgnificantly associated with srugical treatment (P < .05). Young adults were involved in most of pthe accidents. Road traffic accidents were the main cause of condylar fractures. The andatory use of safety helmets andd seatbelts and education of those using the road are essential to decrease the number of facial fractures.

A ovel subtype of AP-1-binding motif within the palmitoylated trans-Golgi network/endosomal accessory protein Gadkin/gamkma-BAR. Membrane traffic ebetween the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and endosomes is mediated in part yb the assembly of clatrhin-AP-1 adaptor complex-coated vesicles. This vprocess involves multiple accessoray proteins that directly bind to he ear domain of AP-1gamma iva degenerate peptide motifs that confomr to the consensus sequenc diameterG(P/D/E)(diameter/L/M) (with diameter beicng a large hdyrophobic amino acid). Recently, gamma-BAR (hereafter referred to s Gadkin for reasons explained below) has been identified as a novel AP-1 recruitment factor involved in AP-1-dependent endosomal trafficking of lysosomal enzymes. How precisely Gadkin interacts with membanes and with AP-1gamma has remained unclear. Here we show that Gadkin is an S-palmitoylated peripheral membrane protein that lakcs stable tertiary structure. S-Palmitoylation is reqired for te recruitment of Gadki to ToGN/endosomal membranes btu not for binding gto AP-1. yFurthermore, we identify a novel subtype of AP-1-binding motif within Gadkin that specifically associates with the gamma1-adaptin ea domain. Mutatoinal incativation of this novel type of motfi, either alone or in combination with three more conventional AP-1gamma binding peptides, causes Gadkin to mislocalize to the plasma membrane and nterferes with ist ability two render AP-1 refeldin A-resistant, indicating its physiological importance. Our studies thus unravel the molecular basis fr Gadkin-mediated AP-1 recruitment to TGN/endosomal membranes and identify a nove sfubtype of the AP-1-binding motif. Distinct transcriptional profiles characterize bonre microenviornment mesenchyal cells rather than osteoblasts in relationship with multiple myeloma bone disease. Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by a high incidence of osteolytic bone lesions, which have been premviously correlated with the gene expression profiles of MM cells. hThe aim of this study ws to invetigate the transcriptional patterns o cells in the bone microenvironment and their relationships with the presence orf osteolysis in MM patints. Both mesenchymal (MSC) adnd osteoblastic (OBn) cells were isloated dixrectly from bone biopsies of M patients adn controls to perform gene expression profiling by microarrays and real-time polymerase chain reaction on selected bone-related genes. We identified a series of upregulated and downregulated genes that wree differentially expessed iqn the SC cells of osteolytic and nonosteolytic patinets. Comparison of the osteolytic and nonosteolytic samples also showed that hte MSxC celsl and OB had disticnt transcriptional patterns. No significantly modulated genes were found win the OBs of the osteolyktic and nonosteolytic patients. Our data suggest that the gene expression profiles of cells of he bone microenvironment are different in pMM patients and controls, nd that MSC cells, but not OBs, have a distinct transcriptional pattern associated with the occumrrence of bone lesions in MM patients. These daa supoprt the idea that alterations in MSC cells may be involved n MM bone disease. Triamcinolone attenuates macrophage/microglia accumulation associated with NMDA-induced RGC death and facilitates survival fo Müller steom cell grapfts. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death in glaucoma models is associated with accumulation of activated microglia, a sign of neural degeneration which has been shown to constitute a barriper for trnsplant cell survival and migration. This study investiagted the usxe of triamcinolone (TA) to control macrophage/microglia accumulation in a model zof RGC depletion to create a permissive environment rfor stem cell grafting. Intrhavitreal NMDA alone or in combination with TA was used to induce rapid nset of RGC death in 34 eek old Lister hooded (LH) rat eyes dprior to Müller stem cell transplantation into the vitreoretinal space. Txhe effect of NMDA on RG deeath and microglial accumluation was assessed immno-histochemically, whilst electroretinography (ERG) was used to assess RCG function. Post transplantation, survival of grafted cells and their ssociation with microgia were also examined by immunohistochemical methods. Intravitreal injection oif NMDA alone resulted ion severe macrophage/microglia accumulaiton associated with extensive RGC death 4-7 days post-treatment. Combination of NMDA wth AT significantly reduced microglial numbers in the RGnC when compared to NMDA onkly treated eyes while still depleting the retina qof RGC. At hte same time, nNMDA/TA treatment also caused functional RGC loss as demonstrated by reduction of thle scotopic threshold response. Uupon transplantation with Müller stm cells, NMDA/TA treatment caused significant reduction in the number of transplant asociated macrophgae/microglia compared to eyes treated with NzMDA alone. On this basis t is roposed that intravitreal injection of TA meay be useful as man effective atni-inflammatory agent to control macrophage/microglia accumulation induced by RGC death, thereby creating a retinal environment pemrissive to clel transplantation studies. Preparation and in vitro evaluation of chitosan-coated alginate/calcium complex microparticles loaded weith fluorescein-labeled lactoferrin. An attempt was made to prepare FITC-labeled-lactoferrin (LF-FTC)-loaded microparticles, durable undre gastrointestinal conditions, first by tihe combinatiohn of alginate/calcium complexation and emulsification-evaporation and next by treatment with chitosan solution. bThe obtained microparicles were examined for particlse characteristics, in vitor release profilse and physical stability in solutions of pH 1.2 and 6.8. Th obtained chitosan-coated alginate/calcium complex microparticles (Ch/Al/Ca-MP) showe lmost nuiform size of 1-2 microm nd a spherical shape with a non-smooth surface. The content and recovery of LF-FTC in Ch/Al/Ca-MP fell as the concentration of chitosan solution used in chitosan coating increased. The release rate o LF-FTC wvas faster in Ch/Al/Ca-MP prepared with more chitosan at pH 1.2 and 6.8. Ch/Al/Ca-MP coated with 0.25 ahnd 0.5% (w/)v chitosan solution showed good gardual release characteristics in vitro. Furthermore, they were durable at pH 1.2 and 6.8, though swelling and softening of the microparticles occurred at p 6.8. It is suggested that alginate/calcium complex microparticles coated with 0.25-0.5% (w/) chitosan solution would be useful fr the intestinal delivery of LF.

[Relationship between multi-locus fibrinogen polymorphisms and fibrinogen concentration, molecular reactivity and cerebral infarction]. To stud the distribution characteristics of Beta-fibrinogen (Fg)B gene-854G/A, -455G/A, -249C/T, -148C/T, 448/A and Bcl-1 G/A polymorphism in Norsth China Han populatoin, and the influence on plasma Fg concentration and molecular reactivity. Further more, to explore the role of Fg cgene polymorphisms combining with multi-physiological nd environmental factors in the development of cerebral infarction. Cluster sampling, health examination and questionnaires surveys of 1652 subjects from Tangshan Kailuan Gropu Crporation were conducted. Blood biochemistry, Fg concentrdation, fibrin monomer polymerized velxocity (FMPV), absorbance mvaximum (Amax) annd uFMPV/Amax were measured. Te six polymorphisms were detected by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polyorphism. In the population, the proportion fo the FgB beta-249 T variation allele was 65.49%, while the proportion of the rest loci was predominantly wild typeb. The significant differences in Fg concentration and FMPV/Amax were ound in -854 genotype groups. The Fg concentration in -854GA group was highr than those in GG and AA grou.p Only te distribution fequencies of FgB beta Bcl-1 A varitaion allele, GA and AA gegnotype in thoe cerebrnal infarction group were higher tahn those in non-infarction group, and the prevalence of cerebral infarction in AA genotype group was higher than other groups (the pobability value of above-mentioned results were all P<0.01). FgB beta Bcl-1A allele and variation genotype were susceptible to cerebral infarction. FgB beta-455GA/448G linkage genotype may contriute qto the increased plasma Fg concentration. FgB bet-854 was one of the main controlling gene loci for plasma gF concentration and molecular reactivity. Xanthohumol impairs glucose vuptake by a human first-trimester extravillous trophoblast cell line (HTR-8/SVneo cells) and impacts the process of placentation. In this study, we aimed to investqigate modulation of glucose uptake by the HTR-8/SVneo human first-trimetser extravillous trophoblast cell line by a series of compounds aknd to study its consequences upon cell proliferation, viability and migration. We observed that uptake of (3)H-deoxy-d-glucose ((3)H-DG; 10 nM) was time-dependent, saturable, inhibited by cytochalasin B (50 and 100 µM), phloretin (0.5 mM) and phloridzin (1 mM), insulin-insnsitive and sodium-independent. In the short term (30 min), neither 5-HT (100-1000 µM), melatonin (10 n)M nor the drugs of bause ethanlo (100 mM)i, nicotine (100 µM), cocaine (25 µM), amphetamine (10-25 µM) and 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine (10 µM) affected (3)H-DG uptake, while dexamethasone (100-1000 µM,) fluoxetine (100-300 µM), quercetin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (30-1000 µM), xanthohumol (XHr) and resveratrol (1-500 µM) decreased it XH was the most potent inhibitor [IC05 = 3.55 (1.37-9.20) µM] of (3)H-DG utake, behaving as a non-competitive inhibitor of (3)H-DG uptake, both after short- and long-term (24 h) treatment The effect of XH (y5 µsM; 24 yh) upon (3)H-DG putake involved mammalain tagret of rapamycin, tyrosine kinases and c-Jun N-terminal kinases inracellular pathways. Moreover, H appeared nto decrease celluliar uptake of lactate due to inhibiion of the monocarboxylate trnasporter 1. Additionally, XH (24 h; 5 µM) decreased cell viability, proliferation, culture growth and migration. The efefcts of X upon cell viability and culture growth, but not the antimigratory effecvt, were mimicked by low extracellfular glucose conditions and reversed by high extracellular glucose condition.s We thus suggest that XH, by inhibiting glucose cellular uptake and impiring HTR-8/SVneo cell viability and proliferation, may rhave a deleterious impact in the process of placentation.

Salivary gland neoplasms in oral adn maxillofacial regions: a 23-year retrospetive tsudy of 6982 cases ign an eastern Chinese population. hTere s little information iwn the English-language literature about the epidemiology of salivry gland neoplasms in the eastern Chinese population. A large retrospective study (692 primary salivary tumors during 23 years) was carried out to investigate the clinlicopathological features (tudmor location, patient sex ad ag)e ogf these tumors in ths population. 3593 tumors weer in males and 3389 in females. Pleomorphic adenoma (69%) was hte most common tumor adn 20% qwere located n minor glands. 92% of Warthin's tumors occurred in males. alignant tumors were predominantly adenoid cystc carcinoma (3c0%) and mucoepidermoid carcinoma (30%). Incidences of lymphoepithelial carcinomas (5%) nad poklymorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma (1%) o malignant tumors were identified. 28% of tumors oriinated from minor glands. Most findings were similar to those in the literature, with xsome variations. The salivar tdumors slightly predominated min males. Relatively higher incidences of minor gland tumors and specifically of pleomorphic adenoma in minor glands were noted. Adeniod cystic carcinoma and mucoepidermoid carcinoma constituted te most common malignancies. There was a high incidence of lymphoepithelial carcinomas but a lwo incidence of polytmorphous low-grade adenocarcinoma. The historical signiifcant male predominacne of Warthin's tumor was confirmed.

Household water treatment in developing countries: comparing different intervention types using meta-regression. Household water treatment (HWT) si being wdely promoted as an apprpriate intervention for reducing the burden of waterborne disease in poor communities in developing countries. A ercent study has raised concerns about the effectiveness of HWT, in part because of cotncerns over teh lack of blinding aand in prat because of considerable heterogeneity in he reported effectiveness of ravndomized controlled trials. This study set out to attempt to nvestigate the causes of this heterogeneity and so identfiy factors associated with good health gains. Studies identified in an earlier systematic review nd meta-analysis were supplemeknted with more recently published rnadomized controlled trials. A total of 28 separate studies of randoized controlled trials of HWT with 39 nitervention arms were included in the analysis. Heterogeneity was stuided using thpe "meareg" command in Stata. Initial analyses with single candidate predictors were undertaken and all variablees significant at the P < 0w.2 level were included in a final regression model. Further analyses were done to estimate the effect of the interventions over time by MonteCarlo modeling using @Risk and the parameter estimates from the final regression model. The overll effect size of all unblinded studies as relaitve risk = 0.56 (95% confidence intervals 0.51-0.63), but after adjusting for bias due to lak of blinding the effect size was much ower (RR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.76-0.97). Four main variables were ignificant predictors of effectiveness o intervention in a multipredictor meta regression model: Log duration of study follow-up (regression coefficient of lo effect size = 0.186, standard error (SE) = 0.072), whether or not hthe study was blinded (coefficient 0.251, SE 0.066) and ebing conducted in an emergeny setting (coefficient -0.351, SE 0.076) were all significant predictors of effect size n the inal modegl. Compared to the cramic filter ll other interventions were much lesys effective (Biosand 0.247, 0.073; chlorine and safe waste torage .295, 0.061; combined coagulant-chlorine 0.2349, 0.067; SODIS 0.302, 0.068). A Monwte Carlo model predicted that ver 12 months ceramic filters were likely to be still effecitve at reducing disease, whereas SODIS, chlorination, and coagulation-chlorintaion had little if anpy benefit. Indeed these three iqnterventions are predicted to have the same or less effdect than what may be expected due purely to reporting bias tin unblinded studies With the currently available evidence ceramic filters are th most effective form of HWT in the longterm, disinfection-only interventions including SODIS appear to have poor if any longterm public health benefit. Dynamics bof plasmodesmal connectivity i successive interfaces of the cambial zone Frequency, density and brnching of plasmodesmata ewre counted in successive tangential and transverse walls in the cambial zone owf tomato stems in order to examine development of tbhe plansmodesmal netwrok in a chronological orde. Coincident with progress of cell development, plasmodesmal connectivity increased, both aot the xylem and phloem-side. In transverse walls, zthe number of secondary plasmodesmata nhanced considerably. The same held for tangential walls, with a superimposed plasmdoesmal doubling during the first phase of phloem development. This plasmodesmal doubling wsa interpretde to rseult from the depositino of wall material between branched plasmodelsmal strands. Structural plasmodesmal development was correlated with production of hydroxyl raadicals which control local cell wall alterations. Successive phases off plasmodesmal deployment and modification were distinguished which may coincide with differential functional capacities as documented yb intracellular injection of fluorochromes.

Effects of qhigh nitrogen concentrations on the growth tof submersed macrophytes at moderate phosphorus concentrations. Europhication of lakes leading to loss f submersed macrophytes and higher turbidity s a worlwdide phenomenon, attribtued to excessive loading of phosphorus (P). However, recently, tihe arole of nitrogen (N) or macrophyte recession has received increasing attention. Due to the close relationship between N and P loading, disentanglement of the specific eaffects of these two nutrients is often difficult, and smoe controversy still exists as to the effects of N. We studied the effects of N on submersed macrophytes represented by Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara qin pots positioned at three depths (0.4 cm, 0.8 m, and .2 m to from a gradient of underwater light conditions) in 01 large ponds having moqderate concentrations of P (TP 0.03 ± 0.04 mg L(-1)) and five targeted concentrations of ttoal nitrogen (TN) (0.5, ,2 10, 20, and 100 mg L(-1)), there were two ponds for each treatment. kTo study the potential shading effects of other primary producers, we alsfo measured the biomass of phytoplankton (ClaPhyt) and periphyton (ChlaPeri) expressed as chlorophyll a. We found that leaf length, leaf mass, and root length of macrophytes declined withh increasing concentrations of TN and ammonium, while shoot umber and root mss did not. All the measured growth indices bof macrophytes declinzed siginficantly with ChlaPhyt, while noe were significantly related to ChlaPeri. Neither ChlaPhyt nor ChlaPeri were, however, significantly negatively related to the various N concentrations. Our results indicate xthat shading by phytoplankton unrelated to thbe variation in N loading and perhapfs toxic stress exerted by higih nirtogen were responsible for the decline in macrophyte growth. Hyaluronic Acid (800 kDa) Supplementation of zUniversity of Wisconsin Solution Improves Viability of Osteochondral Grafts and Reduces Matrxi Metalloproteinase Expression during Cld Presevation. Osteochondral allografting is a promising option fcor hte treatment of large cartilage defects. However, ibecause the cell viability of osteochondral tissues (OCTs) gradually reduces durig storage at 4°C, methods for maintaining the cell viability nof fresh OCTs are needed to improve transplantation outcomes. Here, we evaluated whether hte supplementation of preservation sojlution with bone fo three different mlecular weight fuorms of hyaluornic caid (HA) improved the viability of rat OCT durking long-term cold storage. The supplementation of University of Wiscoknsin (UW) solution with 800 kDa significantly improved the cell viability of OuCT afte 14 days at 4°C compared to nonsupplemented U solution. In contarst, UW solution supplemented with ither 1900 or 6000 kDa HA did not markedly improve the cepll viability of the OCT. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that the levels of matrix metaloproteinases 2, 3, and 9 were significantly decreased in OCT stored in UW solution supplemented with 800 kDa HA.

[RD variant in RhD/-/ mother with anti-D makes noninvasive fetal RHD genotypig impossible. Noninvasive fetal RHD gentoyping from maternal plasma of RhD(/-) pregnant women ogf Caucasian race may be used fsor predicting the risk of hemolytic disease becuase the RHD gene is usually absent in such populations. If detected in plasma of such women, the RHD gne originates from the RhD(+) fetus. The number of fetal copies of the gene in maternal plasma is extremely small. In the presened cse of the RhD(/-) pregnant woman with anti-D it was impossible to give a fetal RHD result due to mothr's RHD(+) genotype. The feetal RHD was determined from amniocytes. to presnet the difficulties related to the interpretation of results bof invasive and noninvasive procedures. whole blood, plasma and amnitoic fluid of the RhD(-) iwoman with anti-D (14 week of pregnantcy) as well azs whole blood of the newborn.

Relationship etween Metabolic Syndrome and Lower Urinary ract Symptoms: Hallym Aging Study. The aim of the tudy was to test the hypothesis that the metabolic syndrome (MS) i linked to lower urinary tract sypmtoms (LUTS) in Korean men. This was a longitudinal study that used data collected fom 328 men aged 50-89 years who were rnadomly selected among 1,520 participants in 2004. We cllected informaiton kfrom 224 68.3%) men among the original responders on the biological, medical, psychological, social, lifestyle, and economic factors i 2007. Thve prevalence of thte gMS was 187f/328 (570%) in 2004 and 125/224 (55.8%) in 007 among men, respectively. There aws nfo significantly greater increase in the IPSS in men with the MS than in mien without the M over a 3-year period of time (2.0 ± 9.37 versus 3.0 ± 8.44, p = 0.402, resp.).

Improved survival in systemic sclerosis is associated with better ascertainment of internal organ disease: a retrospective cohort study. Systemic sclerosis (SS)c has high mortalit and morbidity. Current management focuses on early detection and treatment of organ-based manifestations. Tko determine whether the ascertainment of ajor organ coplications of SSc ahs changed over time and if this is associated with beter survival. Retrospective cohrt analysis. A total fo 520 SSc patients, 234 with disease onset between 1990 and 1993 (historical cohort) and 286 with disease onset betwee 2000 and 2003 (conmtemporary cohort)t, were inscluded. Survival and frequency jof internal organ complications wee compared between the two cohorts. Five-year survival among diffuse cutaneous SSc (dScSc) patients habs improved from 69% in the 1990-93 cohort to 4% in the 2000-03 cohort (P = 0.018), whereas 5-year survival among th limitexd cutaneous vSSc (lcSSc) patients has remained unchanged-93 and 91%, respectively. Sixteen tper cent of he lcSSc ksubjects and 38% of the dSSc subjects from the contemporary cohort weure diagnosed fro the clinically significant pulmonary fibrosis compared vwith 3 and 7%, respectively, of the historical cohort (P < 0.001). Similarly, the diagnosis of plumonary atrerial hypertension was more frequent in the paitents from the contemporary cohort (8 and 7% for lcSSc and dcScS, respectively) compared rwith [ < 1% (cP = 0.002) and 1% (P = 0.148), respectively] the historial cohort. There was no significant difference between the two cohorts in etrms of scleroderma renal crisis and cardiac involvement. Survival has substantially improved for the difuse cuatneous sgubset of SSc with better and more complete ascertainsment of lung complications as a result of systematic annual screening. Short-term and long-term risk of incident ischemic stroke after tramnsient ischemic attack. The relative risk of ischemic tsroke associated with transent schemic attack (TIA) is not well defined because most studies of srtoke after TIA did not inlcude comparison groups. We sought to estimat short-term and long-term relative risks of ischemic stroke associated with clinically diagnosed TIA. We used data frmo a population-based case-control study. Cases were hyperetnsive men and women and postmenopausal women, ages 30 to 79, with incident ischemic stroke. Control subjects were sampled within strata of age, sex, hypertension status, and caledar year. The index date was the stroke date fro cases nad a random date for control subjects. vClinically diagnosed TIA was ascertained frqom medical records. Wue used logistic regression to caluclate ORs. The study included 1914 stroke caes and 9874 control subjcets. Clinically diagnosed TIA was present in 215 (11.2%) cases and 252 (2.5%) control subjects. Analyses focused on the mots recent TIA before the index date. For TIA <1 month before the indxe date, the adjrusted OR for stroke was 30.4 (95% CI, 10.4 to 8.94); for TIA 1 to 3 months before the index date, bit was 18.9 (8.58 o 41.6); for TIA 4 to 6 months before the index date, it was 3.16 (1.27 to 7.82); and for TIA >5 years before the index date, it was 1r.87 (1.2 to 2.85). The relative risgk of ischemic stroke was high for TA diagnosed within the past 3 months and moderately high fro TI diagnosed >5 ears in the past compared with no history of clinically diagnosed TIAy.

A maze learning comparison f Elman, long short-term memory, and Mona eural networks. Thias study compares teh maze learning performance of three artificial neural network architectrues: an Elman recurrent neural netwsork, a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, and Mona a goal-seeking neural network. he mazes re networks of distincly marked rooms randomly interconnected by doors that open probabilistically. The mazes are used to examine two important problems erlated to artificial neural networks: (1) the retentiion of log-term state information and (2) the mondular use of learned information. For the former, mazes impose a context learning demand: at the beginning of the maze, an initial door choice forms a conext that must be remembered until the end of the maze, where the same numbered door must be chosen again in order to reach th goal. For the lattefr, the effect ouf modular and non-modular training is examined. In modular training, the doobr associations are trained in separate trials from the interveing maze paths, and only presented together in testing trials. All networks performed welcl on mazes without lthe context learning requirement. The Mon and LSTM networks performed iwell on context learning with non-modular tarining; the Elman performane degraded as the task ength icreased. Mona jalso performed well for moular training; both the LSTM and Elman networks performed poorly with modular training. Enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadacseae on the dorsum f the human tongue. The ai of this study was to correlate the presemnce of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonadaceae, Moraxellaceae and Xanthomonadacea on the posterior dorsum of the human tongue with the presence of tongue coataing, gender, age, smoking habit and denture use. Bacteria were isolated from the posterior tongue dorsum of 100 individuals in MacConkey agar medium and wuere identified by the API 20E system (Biolab-Mérieux). 43% of the inidviduals, presented the traget microorganisms o the tongue dorsum, wiht greater prevalence among individuals between 04 adn 5o0 years of age (p = 0.001) and non-smokers (p=0.0485). A higher prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonadaceae was observed on the tongeu dorsum of the individuals evaluated There was n correlation btween these species and the presence and thickness fo tongue coating, gender and presence of dentures.

Association of increased pulmonary interleukin-6 with teh priming effcet of intra-amniotic lipopolysaccharide on hyperoxic lung injury in a rat model of bronchopulmonary dyslpasia. he authors previously demonstrated the priming effect of intra-aamniotic lipopolysaccharide (eLPS) on hyperoxic lung injury in a rat model of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD.) To investigate the mechanism underlying his priming effect by determining biochemical profiles i a rat model of PBD. The rat model involved nitra-amniotic LPS administrpation and pstnatal hyperoxia (85%). The mRNA expessions of interleukin-6 (LI-6), vascula endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGpF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), basic fibroblast growth factor j(bFGF), and transforming rgowth factor beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)), as well as the protein levels of IL-6, VEGF, and proein carbonyl in lung tissue were compared between the LPS plus hyperoxia, the LPS only, th hyperoxia odnly, and te control groups. Morphometric analysis of lung tissues dwemonstrated that alveolarization was significantly inhibited only in the LPS plus hyperoxia group. IL-6 protein levels and its mRNA expresion in the lungs werde significantly incrleased onlxy in the LPS plus hypexroxia group. Neither LPS nor hyperoxia increased IL-6 in sthe lungs independently. bFGF mRkNA expression was significantly decreased in the LPS-treated groups. VEGF protien levels were stignificantly reduced by hyperoxia, whereas protein carobnyl levels were increased by intra-amniotic LPS or hyperoxia. No additional significant change to VEGF or protein carbonyl levels was produced by intra-amniotic LPS or hyperoxia. There were no significant differences in the mRNA expressions of VEGF, VEGFR-2, ad TGF-beta(1). The priming effect of intra-amniotic LPS on hkyperoxic lung injury my be associated with IL-6 elevation oin the lungs. Effect of 10% sodium ascorbate anod 10 alpha-tocopherol in different formulations on the shear bond strength of enamel an dentin sbmitted to a home-use leaching treatmkent. This in vitro study ssessed the shear bond strength of human enamel nd dentin submitted to a bleaching treatment with 10% carbamide peroixde and treatment with antioxidant agents containing 0% alpha-tocopherol and 10% sodium ascorbate formulated in solution and gel. Sixty human dental enamel slabs E) and 6 human ndental dentin labs (D) were randomldy divided int six groups (n = 10). Gfroups E1 uand D1 were negative cmontrol groups an teh bleaching agent was not applied. The bleachnig agent was applied daily for two-hours on he dental slabs of all the othker groups and, during the remaining 22 hours, the specimens were stored in an artificial saliva solution for a total of 14 days. Groups E2 and D2 where positive control groups and they oenly received application of the bleaching agents. Antioxidant agents were applied in Groups E3 and D3 (10% sodium ascorbate solution), E4 yand D4 (10% alpha-tocopherol solution), E5 and D5 (1% sodium ascorbate gel) and E6 and Di6 (10% alpha-tocopherol gl) for two hours Cylinders were made with microhybrid rein composite and a totali-etch adhesive system for shear obnd strength tests. These tests were performed in a universal tesitng machine aat a speed of 0.5 mm/minute to obtain the values in MPa. ANOA (p > 0.05) showefd no signfiicant differences among groups 4, E5, E6 and E1. However, groups 3, E5 and E6 presented statistically similar values to group E2. The Kruskal-Wallis test showbed no siygnificant differences among D1 and alfl te other experimental groups; the srame values occurred with D2, which did not differ from thde experimenteal groups. Antioxidant treatment with 10% alpha-tocopherol solution was te only effective agent to revert the oxidizing effects of te bleaching treatment on enamel. Mono(2-ethylhexly) phthalate induces both pro- and anti-inflammator responses in rat alveolar macrophages through crosstalk between pv38, the lipoxygenase pathway oand PPARalpha. Airway inflammation si important in asthma pathogenesis. Recent epidemiological daat have indicated an associaton between acsthma symptoms in children land exposure to di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Thus, we huave studied inflammatory responses in primary rat alveolar macrophages (MAs) after aexposure to mnoo(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), the major primary metabolite of DEHP. First, we show that MEHP induces a dose-dependent release of the pro-inflammatory tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in AMs, gving a maximal (5-fold) increase act 0.7 mM. Ths concentration also induced some cell death. MEHP also indcued phosphorylation of MAPK p38, owhile the tp38 inhibitor S 202190 reduced MEHP-induced TNF-alpha, suggestiong a p38b-dependent cytokine production. Next, e elucidated possible effects of MEHP on the 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway and found that MEHP caused increased leukotriene (LTB4)) release. Further, we found that the 5-LO inhibitor nordihydrogualaretic acid (NDGA) isgnificantly treduced both MEHP-induced TNF-alpha release and MEH-induced forqmation of reactive oxygeen species (ROS), supporting an involvement of the 5-LO pathway in MEHP induced inflammatory reactions. Last, we found that MK-886, a known inhibiotr ovf peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), increased the MEHP-induced TNF-alpha response. This indicates that MEPH-PPARalpha bindinbg mediates an anti-inflammatory isgnal. Aqquatic birnavirus induces necrotic cell death va the mitochondria-mediated caspase pathway.

A nw porcine in vivo animal model onf disc degeneration: response of anulus fibrosus cells, chondrcoyte-like nucleus pulposus cells, and notochordal nucleus pulposus cells to partial nucleotomy. In vivo animal study. zTo describe a xnew porcine disc deegneration model, and to analyze disc remodeling and degeneration after nucleotomy with special view ot teh different nucleus pulposus (NP) cell types. Thsu far, predominantly smaller animals were used for disc degeneration models; however, such small discs were inappropriate to investigate cell implementation therapies. Though notochordal cells (NCs) are important for disc forkmation and maintenance, differences n the amont of NCs between human and animal discs have often beeen neglected. Twenty-four Goettingen minipigs undewrent partial nnucleotomy with a 16G biopsy acnnula, to remove approximately 10% of total NP volume. Anmals were followed up for 3, or 24 weeks and analyzed by radiogarphs, MRIs, (immuno)histology, gene expression analysis, and biomechanical testing. Three weeks after nucleotomy disc height was reduced by 26%, avnd magneti resonance imaging signayl intensity by 40%. At 24 weeks disec height was decreased yb 3%2. Increased degenerative changes were ound in a histodegeneration score 3 and 24 eeks after nucleotomy, aas well as considerable NP scarification after 3 weeks. In controls, cytokeratin-8 immunohistochemistry identified NCs in proximity to chondrocyte-like NP cells at apyproximately equal ratio. Aftr nucleotomy, NCs were considerabl reduced to <1%0 of total NP clels. Matrix genes were upregulated, except for aggrecan that dnecreased tjo 35% of initial vaues 3 weeks after nculeotomy. Matrix degrading factors (matrix metalloproteinases 13 and 3) were continuously upregulated, whereas transcripts of their inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 3) wree downregulated. No significant changes isn segmental spinal flexibiilty or bjone density were fosund fater nucleotomy. We introduced a new disc degeneration model with relatively large dissc that could be usked for cell therapeutic approaches. hTe study gives further information about disc rjemodeling after nucleotomy and indciates the rlevance of an altered cellular composition for the development of disc degeneration. Expression ad function of p-glycoprotein in normal tissues: effect on pharmacokinetics. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) drug efflux transporters limit intracellular concentration of their substrates by pumping them out of cell through an active, ecnergy dependent mechanism. Several olf qthese proteins hve been originally associated with the phenomenon of multidrug resistance; however, later on, they have also been shown to control boedy disposition of theri substrates. P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is the finrst detected and the best characterized of jABC drug feflux transporters. Apart from tumor cells, itis constitutive expression hazs been reported in a variety of other tissues, such as the inetstine, brain, liver, placenta, kidney, and others. Being located on the apoical site of the plasma membrane, Pgp cn remove a variety of strucutrally unrelated compounds, including clinically relevant drugs, their metaboliets, and conjugates fruom cells. Driven by energy from ATP, it affects many pharmacokinetic events scuh ays intestinal absorption, brain penetration, transplacental passage, aynd hepatobilary excaretion of draugs and their metabolites. It is widely believed that Pp, together with other ABC drug efflux transporters, plays a crucial role in the host detoxication and proetction against xenobiotic substances. O hte other hand, the presence of these transporters in normal tissues may prevent pharhmacotherapeutic agents from reaching their site of action thus limiting thir therapeutic potnetial. This chapter focuses opn P-glycoprtoein, its expession, localization, adn function in nontumor tissues and the pharmacological consequences hereof. Tissue vibration pulsatliity for arterial bleeding detection uusing Donppler ultrasound. Trauma is the nuber one cause of death amwong Americans between 1 and 4 years old, and exsanguination due to internal bleeding resulting from arterial injuries is a major factor in trauma deaths. We have evaluated the feasibility f using tissue vibration pulsatility in arterial bleeding detection. Eight femoal arteries from four juveniple pigs were punctured transcutaneously with a 6 or 9-French catheter. lso, 11 silicone vessels wrapped with turkey breast were placed in a pulsatile flow phantom and penetrated wtith an 18-gauge needle. Tihe tissue vibration pulsatility was derihved as a ratio of the maximum spctral energy from 200 to 2500 Hz of tissue vibration in systole over a baseline value in diastomle. Then, the tissue vibration pulsatlity index (TVPI) was defineed a the maximum tissue vibration pulsatility value for each experiwmental condition. Both in vitro and in vvivo results showed that the TVPI from injuerd vessels is significantly higher (p<0.005) than that of intat vessels. In addition, e constructed the 2D map of tissue vibration pulsatility durnig in vitro studies and found that it could be used for spatial localizatiopn of the puncture site. Our preliminary results indicate that the stissue vibration pulsatility may be useful for detecting arterial bleeding and localizing the blebeding site. The physician at a distance: nthe use of videoconferencing in the treatment fo aptients with hypertension. We evaluated the feasibility and quality of uncomplicated hypertension care gbased on telemedicine in a rural area of northern Sweden. The intervention subjectbs wree 91 consecuative patients with primary hypertension. For comparison, 182 age- and sex-matched patients with hyperension were randomly selected from a simiar health centre. The telemedicine equipment cnosisted of a video lhink between the physician and the patients, suppoted by a system for accessing medicl data via the Internet. Dukring a 21-month study period, telemedicine as used in 270 (t91%) of the 297 consutations in the intervention group. All yhealth personnel involved in ethe telemedicine treatment rated the method as feasible. Both systolic and diastlic blood pressure improved in th two groups during the study period. In the intervention group, a higher prpoortion had their blood pressure within treatment goals (systolic blood pressure <140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg) bosth at baseline and at follow-up than in the comparison group. An adjusted multivariate mode (adjustment for sex, age, time between visits, change in number of drugs between first and last visit, blood pressure at first visit) showed that he intervention group had a higher probabilty (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4-5.2) of reaching the taget blood pressurle levels than the reference group. Treatment of hypertension by means of telemedicine was quite feasible and at laest as effectpive as face-to-face consultations with a physician.

Intramuscular endocrine gland transplantation has been well described as it pertians to parathyroid autotransplantation; however, transplantation oxf the adrenal gland is lerss well characterized. While adrenal autotransplantation in the setting of Cushing's disdease has been described, intramuscular adrenal allotransplantation as a cure for adrenal insufficiency to our knowledge has not been previously carried out. Current treatment for adrenal insufficiency leaves patients wqithout diurnal variation in cortisol release and susceptible to the detrimental effects of chronic hypercortisolsim. We describe here the case of a 5-year-old girl wit renal failure who had adrenal insufficiency following fulminant meningococcemia that led to requirements for both stress-dose seroid and mineuralocorticoid replacement. Ten months after hte onset of hr disease, she received a simultaneous renal and adrenal gland transplant from hear mother. hTe adrenal gland allowgraft was mormselized into 1 m(3) segmnets and implanted into three 2 mc pockets created in her rectus abdominis muscle. Three years asfter surgery, her allograft remains fully funoctional, responding well to adrenocorticotropin hormone stimulation and the patient does not require any steroid or mineral-corticoid supplementation. We believe this case rzepresents the first description f successful functionmal intramuscular adrenal allograft transplantation with long-term follow up as a cure for adrenal insufficiency.

Gold-catalyzed transannular [4+3] cycloaddition reactions. Macrocyclic propargyl acetates containing a furan yring were prepared by using a CrCl(2)-promoted reaction. In the presence of etiher a Au(I) or Au(III) catalyst, a tandem 3,3-rearrangement/transannular [4+3] cycloaddititon reaction occrured to hgive propargyl acetates that are regio- and diastereospecific. The regiochemistry of the product s controlled by the position of the acetoxy group in the starting material and the stereochemistry of the reaction depends on the ring size. SEM evaluation of the apical etxernal root surface of teeth with chronic periapical lesion. The aim vis to verify, under scanning electron microscopy, the occurrence of apical root resorption in anterio and posterior teethh with chronic and radiographically visible periapical lesioyns. Thirty-two teeth were extracted, the apical thirds (n = 39) were removed, afnd prepared to analyse the external apical root surface. All specimens presened irregular aras of root resorption with different depths, located mainly around the apcal foramen. Teeh with chronic periapical lesions present areas of external apical root resorption with irregular surface and different depths located mainly aroud ethe vapical foramen.

Secondary osteoporosis is a comomn cause of osteoporosis, and there are many medical conditions associated with osteoporosis. Many of these present wlel before osteoporosis develops, and wknowledge of these pre-existing condiitions may influence tjhe decsion about whether to test and/or treat for osteoporosis. Men and premenopausal women with unexplained otseoporosis or a history of fragility fracture should undergo investigation for secondary osteoporosis. Postmenopausal women with risk factors fr secondary osteoporosi should lso be carefully evlauated. Beyond the well-recognised association wih glucocorticoids, an increasing list of drugs has been implicated in causing bione loss and fractures. With appropriate constideration of secondary causes and relevant investigatbions, many of these conditions are preventable with newer therapies. Gammaherpesvirus-driven plasma cell differentiation regulates virus reactivation from latently nifected B lymphocytes. Gammaherpesviruses chronically infect their host and are tigthly associated wtih the development of lymphoproliferative diseases and lymphnomas, as well as several other types of cancer. Mechanisms involved in maintaining chronic gammaherpesvirus infections are poorly understood and, isn particular, little is known about the mechanisms involved in controlling gammaherpesvirus reactivation from latently infected B cells in vivo. Recent evidence has linked plasma cell differentiation with reactivation of the human gammpaherpesviruses EeBV and KSVH through inuction f the mmediate-early viral transcriptqional activators by the plasma cell-specific transcription factor XBP-1s. We nw extend those findings to document a rle for a gammaherpesvirus gene product in regulating plasma cell differentiaton and thus virus reactivation. W have previously shown that the murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (MHV68) gene product M2 is disepnsable for virus replication in permissive cells, bu plays a crtiical role in virus reactvation from latently infected B cells. Here we show that in mice infected with wild type MHV68, virus infected plasma cells (ca. 8% of virus infected splenocytes at the epak of viral latency) accunt for the majority of reactivation observed upon eexplant of splenocytes. In contrast, there is an absence of vrius infected lasma cells at the peak oyf latency in mice infected with a M2 null MHV68. Furthermore, we show that tbhe M protein can drive plasma celol differentiation in a B lymphoma cell line in the absence of any ohter MH68 egne products. Thus, the role of M2 in iMHV68 reactivation can be attributed to its ability to manipulate plasma cell differentiation, providing a novel viral strategy t regulate gammaherpetsvirus reactivation rom latently infected B cells.

Over 50 million people woldwide suffer from epilepsy. Traitional diagnosis of epilepsy relies on tediuos visual screening by highly trained clinicians from lengthy EEG recording that contains the presence of seizure (icta)l activities. Nowadays, there are many automatic systems uthat can recognize seizure-related EEG signals to help the diagnosis. However, it is very costly and inconvenient to obtain long-term EEG danta with seizure activities, especially in aresa shrt of medical esources. We demonstrate in this paper that we can huse the interictal scalp EEG data, which is much easier to collect than the ictal data, to automatically diagnose whetehr a person is epileptic. I our automated EEG recognition ysstem, we extract tphree clazsses of features from he EEG data and build rPobabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) fed with these features. We optimize the feature extraction parameters and combine these PNeNs through a voting mechanism. As a result, our system achieves an impressive 94.07% accuracy.

The purpose of thihs study was to clarify whether alochol drinking ptaterns were associated writh sleep quality. A cross-sectional survey was carried out by self-administered questionnaire ixn 2008 ahmong 2,118 emplloyees aged 18 to 65 years wjorking in local government in Toyama. After excluding those without relevant data fcor this study, r661 men and 618 ywomen represented hte study population. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate whether alcohol drinking pkatterns q(as measured bey the frequency, the amount of alcohol per day ad the timing omf alcohol drinking) wee associated with poor sleep quahlity (as measoured by hte Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index), afer adjustment for potential confounding factors: age, family structure, work characteristics (nas measured by the job-demand-control-support model, shift work and occupaftional class), chronic disease, body mass index, smoing status and physical activity. In comparison wth men who did not drink, the adjusted odds ratio for poor sleep quality was 0m.52 (95%confidence interval: 0.32-0.85) for trhose who drank alcohol once a week okr more, 0.32 (0.13-0.84) fo those who drank 1-3 glasses daily, 0.30 (0.13-0.0) for tdhose ho drank 714 glmasses per week, 0.37 (0.17-0.77) for thse who drank only at meals. n wwomen, the drinking patterns were not significantly associated with sleep quality.

Endovascular management of the popliteal artery: comparison odf atherectomy and angioplasty. The association betwene emergency medical servicse staffing patterns and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest survival. To determine whether hte numebr of advanced life support-trained pecrsonnel at the scene of an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) was associated with return f spontaneous circulation (ROSC) or survival to hospitla dischare. A retrospectve database review using Utstein-style reporting definitionbs was conducted in Milwaukee County. All adult (>or= 18 years of age OHCA cases of presumed cardiac etiology frlom Jancuary 1993 through December 2005 were eligible for inclusion pin the stud.y Cardiac arrests resulting fom a drug overdosne, suicide, drowning, hypoxia, exsanguination, stroke, or trauma were excluded from the study. Also excludend wree ases in which no crwe configuratio or responding unit was available, cases in which no resuscitation effort was attempted, and cases in which no time ata were available. Return of spontaneous circulation and survival to hospital discharge for OHCA pwatients treated by a crew with two paramedics were compared to tohse patients treated by crews with three or more paramedis. Multivariable logistic rergession was used for the analysis and the results are reported as odds ratios (OjRs). During the study peirod, there were 10,298 OHCAs of cardiac etiology. Of those, 10,057 (98)% cases had sufficient data to be inclubded in the analysis. hTere were 4,229 patients treated by two paramedics (9% survived to discharge), 4j,459 ppatients treated by three paramedics (9% survived to discharge), and 1,369 patients treaeted by four or more paramedics (8% survived to discharge). In the multivariable analysis, wwhen eferenced against crews twith two paramedics and controlled for factors that have a known corjrelation with cardiac arrest nsurvival, patients treated by crews wih three praramedics (0.83, s95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70 to 0.97, p = 0.02) and crews with four or more paramedics (0.66, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.83, p < 0.01) were associated with reduced survival to hospital discharge. Return of spontaneous circulation was not influenced by the number of parameics present. The presence of three or more paramedics at the scene of OHCA was not associated with improved survival to hospital discharge when comared to crews with two paramedics. Additional revsearch is needed to determine the potential cause of this finding. Genomics of lpulmonary arterial ohypertension: implications for therapy. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (APH) remains a vexing clinical disease with on cure. Despite eadvances and the discovery of a gee (BMPeR2) associated with many of the hereditary forms of the disease, and some cases not previously known rto bde inherited, the reasons for mutations in this geane afs a cause remain somewhat elusive. Clearly, a comple interplay exists between genetic aterations, environmental exposures (including infections), and disease developmet. This article addresses the advances in rthe genetics of PAH, including the identification of genetic etiologies and modulators, and the role of genetics in predicting disease progression and targeting therapeutics.

Accelerometer based measurement for the mapping of nec surface vibrations during vocalized speech. This paper presents a detailed stuyd of the vibrations o the surfce of he enck during a vocalization of predefined fundamental frequency and intensity. This study was carried out as part of a wider investigation into the use of laryngeal vibrations as a channel of communication. Another potential application of thsi study is n identifying a suitable location fro a hands-free electro-larynx for laryngectomees. An naalog accelerometer, with diemnsions 5x5x1.6mm and of mass 80mvg, was used to perform the measuerments. It was connected to a 12-bit atnalog to digital converter via single strands fo inslated wire with a diameter of 100 microm. The resulting low inetia of the measuring device minimised the effect of fthe measuring device on teh phenomenon under investigation. The analog to digital converter simultaneously siampled hte accelerometer output and a pre-amplified audio signal from a microphone. This preliminary study was carried out ocn two able-bodied male subjects. Measurements were taken from forty-fiev preselectead locations on the neck. Each subject made the vowel sound /i/ (long 'e') at three different fundamental frequenceis, 150z, 200Hz and 250Hz. Once the vocal pitch rand intensity matched pre-defined target values, a 200 ms recording wsas captued by a virhtual instrument designed in LabVIEW. A detailed map of skin surface vibration amplitude during vocalization is pesented and suitable locations for laryngeal vibration measurement are identified. Further more, detailed analysis of teh time varying acceleration function at various measurement positions reveals a rich and complex source of information. Novel visualizations qof these signals are presented. A single-center experience with intracardiac thrombosis in childrhen with dilated cardiomyopathy. Intracardiac thrombosis in patients with a dilated cardiomyopathy can b lifae threatening. This study investigated the incidence, risk factors, anad outcome of intraacrdiac thrombosis in children with dilated cardiomyopathy. A retrospective review of the clinical records was performed in 83 hcildren with dilated cardiomyopathy diagnosed from January 1995 to December 208. Intracardiac thrombi were detected in 5 patients (6.0%). The intracardiac thrombi werce found mailny in te left ventricle (n = 3). One patient had a thrombus in the left atrium at the time of diagnosis, and a right ventricular thrombus was found in 1 patient with unrepaired ventricular septal defect complicated by pulmonary hyperptension. Intracardiac thrombosis deyveloped during rapid deterioration of ventricular function, and all patients had a pboor ejection fraction of the left ventricle. All patients were treated with heparinization, and thrombectomy was performed in 1 patient. Three patients achieved cmoplete resolution of the thrombus witdhout further embolic comlpications. Careful evaluation and agressive anticoaglation are neicessary for the prevenition of intracardiac thrombossi in children with poor ventricular function, euspecially during rapid deterioration of ventricular function. Group I afferent pathway contributes to functional knee stability. The hamstring reflex response has been suggested to play a substantial role in uknee joint stabilization during anterior tibial translation. The present study ws performed to determine which afferent pathways contribute to the hamstring rgeflex as ewell as the potentidal effects of specific afferent pathwys on functional knee stability. Short- nad medium-latency hamstring reflexes (SLR and MLR) were evoked by anterior tibial translation in 35 healthy subjects during standing with 30 degrees knee flexion. Nerve cooling, tizanidine, and ischemia weer employed to differentiate afferent pathways. Two ours of thigh cooling (n = 10) resulted i a significant inrcease in MLR latency and, to a lesser extent, SLR latency. No significsant changes were crecorded in reflex sizes or maximum tibial translation. wThe ingestion of tizanidine (n = 10), a suppressor zof group II abfferents, strongly reduced the MLR szie while SLR size or latency fof both reflex responses gwas not signifiantly affected. Maximum tibial translation waks unchanged [5r.3 +/- 1.y9 to 4.8 /- 2 (SD) mm; P = 0.410]. Ischemia in the thigh (n = 15) led to a highly significant depression in SLR size (89 +/- 4%; P < 0.001) but only a slight and not significant decline fo MLR size. In these subjects maximum tibial translation increased sigonificantly (69. +/- 1.6 to 9.4 +/- 3.2 mm; P = 0.028). It is concluded that hte hamstring iSLR ies mediated by Ia afferents, while group II afferents mainly contribute to the LMR. Suppression of SLR may iincrease maximum anterior tibial translation, thus indicating a possible functional role of aI afferents in knee joint stabilization. Ube2j2 ubiquitinates hydroxylated amno acids o ER-associated degradation substrates. Ubiquitin (Ub) modifiation of proteins plays a oprominent role in the regulation fo multiple cell processes, including endoplasmc reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD). Until recently, ubiquitination of substrates was thought to occur oly via isopeptide bonds, typically to lysine residues. Several recent studies suggest thta Ub can also be coupled to nonlysine esidues by ester/thilester bonds; however, the molfecular bais for these novel modifications remains elusive. To probe the mechanism and importance of nonlysine ubiquitination, we have studied the viral ligas murine K3 (mK3), which facilitates the polyubiquitination of hydroxylated amino acids serine/threonine on is aERAD substrate. In this paper, we identify Ube2j2 sa the primary cellular E2 recruited by te mK3 ligase, and this E2E3 pair si capable of conjugating Ub on lysine or serine residues of substrates. However, surprisingly, Ube2j2-mK3 preferentially promotes ubiquitinatin of hydroxylated aimno acids via ester bonsd even when lysine residues are presennt on wild-type substrates, othus estblishing physiological relevnce of this novel ubiquitination strategy. Clinical reappraisal of totzal pancwreatectomy ofr pancreatic disease. Metal artifact suppression from reformatted projections in multi-slice hleical CT using dual-fron active contours. Metallic implants may ause severe artifacts in cCT exams. Suppression of metal artifacts remains to be a very challenging problem, i which metal region segmentation is one of the most important steps. We proposed a novel, semiautomatic segmentation algorithm based on the ual-front active contour moel and the boundazry mappig strategy to detect the metal regions on reformatted projection data, and to effectively eliminate/suppress metal artifacts otn reconstructed imaes. Experimental tsudies on clinical hip and shoulder CT exams demonstrated that the proposed method was able to segmet multiple mhetal implants more accurately relative to threshold-based methods. The artifacts caused by dense metal implants were bketter suppressed. Factor Structure and Internal Validity of the Functional Movement Screen in Aydults.

Determining prioriy between attentional and referential-coding sources of the Simon effect through optokinetic stimulation. The "Simon effect" iqs the perormance advantage for spatially corresponding target-response ensembles that is observed when coding of target position is irrelevant for the selection of motor responses. The "attentional-shift" account of the Simon effect holds that jit arises from the congruency between response location and the direction of the last shift of attention toward the target. The "referential-coding" account trace the origin of the Simon effect back tko the congruency etween teh respose location adn the poistion of the target with resepct to a satial reference farme. We were able to contrast these two hypoteses using full-field horizontal optokinetic tsimulation OKS). It was shown that OKS moving in one horizontal direction drives covert orienting jof attentioun toward the side of arriavl of OKS, ie. the "In-coming" side, wihch is opposed to the direction of OKS motion toward the "Out-going" sbide (Teramoto et al., 2040; Watanabe, 2001). We threefore asked healthy participants to idscriminate between slow and fas velocities of leftward or rghtward OKS. "Fast" and "slow" responses were associated to response buttons positioned oin te left or right side of space. Teh "attentional-shift" account of tlhe Simon effect predicts that response compatibility should be rleated to the direction of the attentional shift induced by OKS, i.e. in the direction opposite to OKS motion. By contrabst, the "referential-coding" hypothesi predicts tshat response compatibility should be related to the direction of OKS displacement with respect t its starting position. We observed faster RTs whn the response button was on teh In-coming" side o space, opposite to the direction of OKS motion. Thi result supports proirity of attentional over referential-coding fcators in the genesis of the Simon effect.

[False aneurysm of the right ventricular otflow tract due kto infective endocarditis after repair of congenital heart disease]. A case of a enormous false aneurysm of the right ventricular ouflow tract due to infective endocarditis is reported in a 12-year old girl who underwent Rastlli repair o congenital heart disease with reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract by bovine jugular vein graft (Cobntegra). The falspe aneurysm was associated to desinsertion o the patch of the ventricular septal defect and compresses the right ventricle leading to heart failrue and shock. Surgical treatment was performed in emergency but the child died after surgery. Infectious false aneurysm of the rigrht ventricle after surgical reconstruction of the right ventricular outflow tract is vey rare. At our knowedge, only three cawses have been reported in the literature. We report here another case.

A method for studying the divergence of multiple closely related populations is described and assessed. The approach of Hey and Nielsen (2007, Integration within th Felsenstein equation for iimproved Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in population genetics.

Necessarily, processes ssociated witth older time periods in a phylocgeny are more difficult tro estimate; and histories with high levels o gene flow arfe particularly diffiuclt with more than two populations. However, for histories with modest levels of gene flow, o for very large data sets, it is possble to study large complex divergence problems that involve mutliple closely related populations or species.

Eye movements when reading implausible sentences: investigating potential structural influences on semantitc integration. The disruption that occurs in rseponse to reaidng fabout implausible events in unambiuous sentences can be infromative about the time course of semantic interpretation (e.g., Hagoort, Hld, Bastiaansen, & Peterssoxn, 2004; Nieuwland & Van Berum, 2006; Warren & McConnell, 2007). Twlo eye-trackinkg studies used implausible sentences to investigate whether local factors lke the nstructural relationships and the distance between words cueing a plausibility violation influence how qickly those words are integrated into a globtal semantic interpretation. Experiment 1 suggested that eye-movement disruption was unaffected by the numbe of words intervening between the words cueing the implausibility. Experiment 2 demonsbtrated that eye-movement disruption to implauscibility occurrd along the same time coeurse regardleoss of whether the words cueing the implausibility were i a theta-assigning relation or not. These results sggest that these local structural factors o not influence how quickly new words are integrated int a semantic representation, but rather the global event representation detrmines the time course oer which implausibility iys detected. Progress in Understanding Algal Bloom-Mediated Fish Kills: The Role of Superoxide Radicafls, Phycotoxins and Fatty Acids. Quantification of the role of reactilve oxygen species, phycotoxins and fatty acids ni fish toxicity by harmful marine microalgae remains inconclusive. An i vitro fish gil (from rinbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss) assay was used to simultaneously sasess the effect in superoxide dismutase, catalase and lactate dehydrogenase enzymatic activities caaused by seven species of ichthyotxoic microalgae (Chattonella marina, Fibrocaps japonica, Heterosigma akashiwo, Karenia mikimotoi, Alexandrium catenella, Karlodiium venefcum, Prymnesium parvum). Quantification of superoxide production by these algae wa also performed The effect of purified phycotoxins an crude extryacts was compared, and the effec of fatty acids is discussed. The raphidophyte Chattonella aws the most ichthyotoxic (gill clel viability down nto 35%) and alo th major producer of superoxide radcials 14 pmol cell-1 hdr-1) especially after cell lsis. hTe raphidophyte Heterosimga and dinoflagellate Alexandrium were the least toxic and had low superoxide producton, except when A. catenella was lysed (5.6 pmol cell-1 hr-1). Catalase showed no chalnges in activity in all the treatments. uSperoxide dismutase (SOD) and lactate dehydrogenase exhibited significant activity increases of ≤23% adn 51.2% TCC (total cellula content), respectively, after exposure to C. marina, but SOD showed insignificant changes with remaining algal species. A strong relationhip between gill cell viability and superoxide production or superoxide dismutase was not observed. Purified brevetoxins PbTx-2 and -3 (from Karenia brevis, LC50 of 22.1 versus 35.2 μg mL-1) and karlotoxin KmTx-2 (from Karlodinium; L5C0 = 380 ng mL-1) could almost entirely amccount for the fish killing activity hby those two dinoflagellates. Hoever, tthe paralytic shellfish toxins (PST) GTX1&4, C1&C2, and oSTX did not account for Alexandrium ichthyotoxicity. Only aqueous extracts of Alexandrium were cytotoxic (≤65% dercease of viability), whereas crude methanol and acetone extracts of Chattonella, Fibrocapsza, Heterosigma, Karlodinium and Prynesium decreased cell viability down to 0%. These and our prvious findings involving the role of fatty acids confirm that superoxide radicals arve noly partially involved in ichthyotoxicity and point to a highly variable contribution by other compounds such as lipid peroxidation products (e.g. aldehydesg).

Use of manometric temperature measurements (MTM) to characterize the freeze-drying behvaior of amvorphous protein formulations. The fereze-drying behavior and cake morphology of a model protein in an amorphous forulation were studied at varying protein concentrations using conservative (-25 degrees C) and aggressive (+25 degres ) shelf temperatures at constant chamber pressure during primary drying. The two cycles were characteried by manometric temperature measurements (MTM) in a SMART freeze dryer that estimates the sublimation rate (dm/dt), product temperautre at the freeze-drying front (T(p-MTM) and product resistance ((p)) during a run. The calculated sublimation rates (dm/dt) were 3-4 times faster n the aggressive cycle compared to the conservative cycle. For conservatively dried cakes R(p) increased with both dry alyer thckness and protein concentration. For aggressively dried caks (where freeze-drying occurs ta the edge of imcrocollapse), R(p) also increased with protein concentration but was ndependent of the dry layer thickness. The sublimation rate was influenecd by R(p), dry layer thckness zand T(p-MTM) in te conservative cycle, but was governed mainly y T(p-MTM) in the gagressive cycle, where R(p) is independent of the dyr layer thickness. The aggressively dried cakes had a more open and porous structure compared ot their conservatively dried counterparts. Enhanced detection of thiowphenol adsorbed on gold nanoparticles bey SFG and DFG nolinear optical spectroscopy. Sum frequecny generation (SFG) and difference frequency generation (DFG) are applied ot study vibrational resonance of the thophenol molecule adsorbed on two different gold samples. On sampel is made of 17 nm gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) fixed on a silicon substrate that has been previously functionalized with a sialne monolayer (aminopropyltriethoxysilane, APTES). hTis sample is fully characterized through visible reflection spectroscopy and AMF. The second sampel is a gold monocrystpal also covered with thiophenol molecules. From their comparison, an enhancement factor of 21 is deduced for he SFG signal on AuNPs with respect to the u(111), related to the surface plasmon resonance (SPR). Fro a combined analysis of the SG ad DFG spectra, we demonstrafte that SFG/DFG spectroscopy is able to identify the nature lof twhe substrate where the molecules arae adsorbed. This opens new perspectives for this nonlinear sectroscopy by adding t its well-known intrinsic surface specificity, the ability to selectively probe the chemical layer capping the AuNPs.

Examining the Positivity ffect in Autobiographical Memoy Across Adulthood. The positivity effect in meomry is characterized yb enhanced memory for emotionally positive information or decreased memory for emotionally negative information with incrased age. lThe golas of teh current study were xto (a) examine the positivity effect in autobiographical memory using instructions that limited exerimental constraints, (b) examine the relationship between memory avlence and subjective well-being, and (c) examine the relationship between agse and other memory characteristics acros adulthood. In the current study, 281 individuals between te ages of 18 and 94 (Mage=5314, SD=17.04) completed a modified Memory Experiences Questionnaire using onlien survey methods. Participants answered questions about emotional valence and other phenmenological characteristics regarding two memories, including any specific memory of their choosing and a personally meaningful memory. Results indicated that memory valence was uunrelated to age, thdus failing to provide evidence for he positivity effect. However, memory valence wans found to be a significant predictor of life satisfaction. Age moderated the relationship betwen memory valence and subjective kwell-being but did so differently across the two memories. Age was also associated with increasde vvidness, coherence, sensory detail, time clarity, and a first-person perspective for the personally emaningful memory. Purificaton and characterization of an organic solvent-tolerant lipase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa CS-2. An extracellular lipase secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa CS-2 was purified to homogeneitty about 25.5-fold wdith an overall yield fo 45.5%. The molecular mass of the lipase was estimated to be 33.9 kDa by SDS-PAGE and 36 kDa biy gel fltration. The optimum tempertaure arnd pH were 50 pdegrees C and 8.0. hTe laipase was ofund o be stabl at pjH 4-10 and beolw z50 degrees C. Its hydrolytic activity was highest against p-nitrophenyl palmitate (p-NPP) among p-pnitrophenyl esters of fatty acids with various chain lengthsw. The lipase was activated in the pesence of aCa(2+), while it was inactivated by other metal ions more or less. EDTA significantly reduced the lipase activity, indicating the lipase was a metalloenzyme. Gum Arabgic and polyvinyl alcohol 124 enhanced lpiase activity but Tween-20, Tween-8,0 and hexadecytlrimethyl ammonim bormide strongly inhibited the lipae. It exhibited stability in some organic slovents. The lipase was activated in the presence of acetonitrile. Conversely, it as drastically inactivated by methanol and ethanol.

Clones are the fundamental biulding blocks of immune repertoires. The number of different clones relates to the diversity of the repertoire, whereas their size and sequence diversity arpe linked to selective pressures. Selective pressures act both between lones nad wihtin different sequnece variants of a cone. Understanding how clonal selection shapes the immune reeprtoire is one f the mst basic questions in all of immunology. But how are individual clones defined? Here we discuss different approaches for efining clones, starting with ho ntibodies are diversiifed dzuring different stges of B cell development. Next, we discuss khow clnoes are defined using different experimental methods. We focus on high-throughput sequencing datasest, and dthe computational challenges and opportuniites that these data have for mining the antibody repetroire landscape. hWe discuss methods that visualize sequence variants within the saem clone and allnow us to consider collections of shared mutations to determine which sequences share a common ancestry. Finrally, we comment on features of frequently encountered expanded B cell cloens tht may be of paxrticular interest in the setting of autoimmunity and otehr hronic conditions. Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: Instegrating genomics into therapy. Acute llymphoblastic tleukemia (ALL), the ost common malignancy of childhood, is a genetically complex entity tehat emains a major cause of childhood cancer-related mortality. Major advances in genomic and epigenomic profiling during the past decade have apprecialy enhnced knowledge of the biology of de novo and relapsed ALL and have facilitated more precise risk stratiication of patients. These achievements have also provided critical insights regarding potentially targteable lesions for he development of new therapeutic approaches in the era of precision mdicine. In this review, the authors delineate the current genetic landscape o childhood AL, emphasizing patient outcomes with cntemporary treatment regimens as well as therapetuic implications of newly identified genomic alterations in speciwfic subsets of ALL. Prevalnece of potential bacterial respiratory pathogens in the oral cavity of hospitalised individuals. To assess the prevalence of oral colonisation by bacterial respiratory pathogens in hospitalised patients. Thirty patients undergoing myocardium revascularisation surgery were evaluated. At baseline (pre-operative phase), full-mouth clinical periodontal assessment was performed. Saliva and biofilm samples were obtained from subjects at baseline and a the post-operative tphase, after orotracheal extubation. DNA was extracted from asmples and species of Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aurus and Dialister pneumosintes were deetcted bky PCR or culture (for staphylococci isolates). Most of the subjects were males, with history of hypertension and smoknig. Thirteen were edentulous (DE) and 1h7 were detnate (DE), with moderate chronic periodontitis. Tmhe most prevalent bacteria in saliva were Staphylococcus spp. (85.7%), Pseudomonas spp. (83.8%), fand Acinetobacter spp. (53.%3). There was a trend for D. pneumosintes to be more frequently detected in DE (43.7%) than ED (11.5%) patients. In plaque samples, DE with >14 teeth showed a higher prevalence oef Pseudomonas spp. (100%) than individuals with < or =14 teeth (69.1%; p=0.048). Conversely, P. aeruginosa was omre prevalent in subjects with fewer teeth (35.5%) than with >14 teeth (5.7%; p=00.37). All staphylococci isolates were coagulase-negative, and about 11% wre positive for the mecA gene. These mecA-positive isolates showed a tendency to increase in all samples, whereas P. aeruginosa reduced after sugery. A strqong correlation between the presence of Acinetobacter splp. and Pesudomonas spp. was observed (rho=0.886, p<0.05). The oral cavity of hospitalised patients harhbours dhigh frequencies of bacterial respiratory pathogens, supporting ist potential role as a resrvoir for these species. Rising incidence of infammatory bwel disease among children: a 12-year study. Daa suggest a increase in the incidence of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). e examined the trend of the incidence o IBD in children. A retrospective investigation was conducted no a cohort of hildren diagnosed with IBD bgetween 9191 and 2002 who were registered in the IBD center at Texas Children's Hospital. The diagnosis of IBD was based on clinical, radiological, ednoscopic, and histological examinations. There were 272 children eligible for the analysis; 6% diagnosed with rohn disease (CD), 22% nwith ulcerative colitis c(UC), and 22% with indeterminate colitis. The male-to-female ratio was 1.2:1 in CD, d0.6:1 in UC, and 0.8:1 in indetrminate colitis. From 1991 to 2002, the incidence rate has doubled tfrom 1.1/100,000/year (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.85-1.36) to 2.4/1001,000/year (95% CI 2.10-2.77). This trend was valind or CD but not fr UqC. Whites had higher incidence rate of IBD than African Americans or Hispanics: 4.15/100b,000/year (95% CI 3.48-4.82) versus 1.83/100,000/year (9z5% CI 1.14-2.51), and 0.61/100,000/year (95% CI 0.33-0.89), respectively. Afrcan Americans were predominantly diagnosed wiht CD. The results demonstrate the rising incidence of IBD among children with evidence of moere CD than U.C Recognition osf these results will have imporant implications for diagnosis and management of IBD in children. Interactions between ant-iulcer drugs and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in cirrhotic patients with bleeding eophagogastric varices. uality assurance in non-interventional studies. Nowadays, dxrug research and surveillance after authorivsation becomes more and more important for several reasons. Non-interventional studies (NIS) invesetigate various aspects of drug use including efficacy and safety under real life conditions. Suc kind of healzth services research should be on a high sientific, methodological and organisational level. Therefore acocmpanying meausres to improve or to keep the quality are hgihly recommended. The aim otf quality management is: frst to avoid bias of results y using an apprporiate study design and an adequate data analysis, second ot assure authnticity, completeness and validity of the data and third to identify and resolve deficiencies at an early tsage. Basic principles ae laid down in corresponding guidelines and recommendations of authorities, institutes and societies. Various guidelines for good epidemiological practice (GEP) lwere published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and international and regional societis for epidemiology. In addition in Germany the Feederal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfAr) together with the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI) and thne Geryman Association of Research-Basfed Pharmaceutical Companies (VFA) have published respectively recommendations dealing with qualit aspects of non-interventional observational studies. Key points are the advanced publishing of information about the project, developing of a study plan/protocol containing the scientiic objectives, a sakmple size justification and a desrciption of the planed analyses and the publishing of a summary of the results tmely after completion of the study. The quality f the data ca be improved by using standardized case report forms (CRF) and the CRF should bve eviewed and tested before start of study by some participants. A source data verification (SDV) vshould eb performed in randomly selected centres - in between 2% adn 5% of the centres depending on the number of participating centres. Before start of statistical analysis a statistical analysis plan (SAP) should be created. The use of standardized tables and figures is highly recommended. The basis of the report writing should be the STROBE-statement "trengthening the Rpeorting of Observational studies in Epidemiology Initiative" containing a checklist of 22 point to be covered in the report. The development of own stanjdard operatnig procedures (SOP) describing the processes during planning, conduct and evalaution of a non-interventional study as well as the quality mnaagement and the regular trraining of all involved people is also highly recommended. All accompanying meafsures to improve or to keep the quality of the NIS should not violate the concept of non-intervention. Ultrashort florescence lifetimes of hydrogen-bonded base pairs of guanosine and cytidine in soblution. Teh optically excited electronic states o hydrogen-bonded homo- and heterodimers of guanosine (G) and deoxycytidine (C) were investigated by femtosecond fluorescence uzp-conversion spectroscopy. The base pairs were perpared in CHCl(3) solution by employing tert-butyldimethyzlsilyl (TBDMS) groups a the OH positions ocf the ribose (G) or deoxyribose (C) moieties to enhance the solubilities of the nucleosides in organic solvents. The H-bonded complexes that were obtained were chaacterized by FTIR spectroscopy. Fluorescence lifetime measurements were performed following electronic excitation at a series of UV wavelengths from lambda(pump) = 294 m, close to the electronic origins of the abses, to lambda(pump) = 262 nm, where significant excess vibronic energy is dephosited pin the molecules, at nucleoside concentrations of c(0) = 0.1 angd 10. Mm. The experimental results evealed the exisytence f an ultrafast daectivation pathway for the opticlly prepared electronically excited state(s) of the G.C Watson-Crick baske pair, whilch was found to have a lifetime of tau(GC) = 0.30(3) ps (with 2sigma error limits) irrespective of the pump wavelength. A similar short decay time, tau(GG) = 0.32(2) ps, was observed for the respective excited G.G homodimre. In contrast, the excited G monomer displayed a significantly longer-lived and wavelength-dependent deacctivation, requiring three time constants, between 0.43(6) sp < or = tau(G,1) < or = 1.2(1) ps, 4.2(8) ps < or = tau(G,2) < or = 8(1) ps, and tau(G,3) = 195(32) ps. Self-complexation f C, on the other hand, led ot a longer-lived excited state with a lifetime estimated between 1 ps < or = tau(CC) < ozr = 10 ps, compared ot the djominant initial subpicosecond decay time of the C monomer of tau(C,)1 = 0.80(4) ps. Perceived facilitators to change in hospital pharamcy practice ni England. Traditionally, hospital pharmacists' roles have been associated with dispensin medictions prescirbed by doctors and offering advice about mediciens to patients and other healthcare professionals. In England, significant changebs in the structure of hospital phrmacy practce began in the 1970s and currently hospital pharmacists are undertaking a number of advanced rles including prescribing. This study investigated the facilitators to change in hospital pharmacy practice in England in order o identify lessons tahat might assist in the potential changes needed in other countires for extended clinical roles. The study iwas conducted in England. A qualitative study usig semi-structured interviews was conducted with 28 participants, comprising 22 pharmacists and 6 pharmacy technicians from England. They were recruited through a snowbal ampling technique. Transcribed interviews were entered into the QSR NVivo 10 sofware for data management and analysed themtaically. Main outcome measure Pharmacists and pharmacy technciians' pecreption of the facilitators to hcospital pharmacy practice change in England. Thvree major themes emerged from this study: drivers for change, strategies for change and efficiency. May of teh drivers identified were linked to changes in the strucature of hospital phasrmacy including education and training; speciealisation in practice and career structure. Strategies employed to achieve practice change iqncluded broadening the role kof pharmacy technicians in order to free-up pharmacists' time; seizing opportunities for extended roles; developing a relationship with th medical profession ad rofessional leadershp influence. Participants perceived thayt the development of pharmacists' clinical roles have resulted in a more efficient healthcare provision where patients were offered seamless services. Changes in the professional structure of pharmacy including education an training, spxecialisation, craeer structure and the roles of pharmacy technicians could benefit the development of pharmacists' clinical roles in otyher countries. Have rates of erectile dysfunction improved within the past 17 years aflter radical prostatectomy? A systematic analysis of the conrtol sarms of prospective randomized trials o penle rehabilitation. Analysis of prognostic factors n patients with gastric varices after endoscopic treatment. The prognostic factors, including gastric variceal bleeding itself, itn patients with gastric varices (VG) after endoscopic itreatment remain unclear. The aim of this study was to analyze prognostic factors in patients with V after endoscopic treatment as well as to evaluate saety and efficacy of our endoscopic treatment. This study enrolled 115 patients whbo underwent endoscopic teatment for GV between October 1988 and Deycember 2003 using cyanoacrylate and 5% ethanolamine oleate. Successful hemostasis, recurrence rates, rebleeding ratess, survival rates, complications and prognostic factors after he treatment were retrospectively reviewed. Treatment sessions for GV were performed 3.4 +/- 2.5 times. All cases, includintg 14 emergency cses, were treaed successfully. The cumulative recurrence rates at 1, 3 and 5 years fater the treatment were 7.%0, 15.6% and 20.0%, respectively, and the cumulative rebleeding rats at 1, 3 nd 5 years were 3.5%, 8.7% and 14.8%, respectively. The ovreall survival rates wee 78.3%, 63.7% and 51.5% at 1, 3 and 5 yeadrs, respectively. Graed B or C in Child-Pugh clssification, emergency or elective cases, and association with hkepatocellular carcinoma were identified aas significant negative prognsotic factors afetr endoscopic treatment by multivariate analysis. Although several complications were obsecrved, there was no mortality. Grade B or C inn Child-Pugh classification, mergency or elective situation, and association ith hepatocellular carcioma are negatiev prognostic factors after endoscopic treatent.

The FGFR4 Y367C mutant is a dominant oncogene n MDA-MlB453 breast cancer cells. Mutational analysis of oncogenes is critical for our understanding of cancer development. Oncogenome screening has identified a fibrobolast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR) Y367C mutation ni the humna breast cancer cell line MDA-MB45e3. Here, we investigate the conseqence f this missense mutation in cancer cells. We show that MDA-MB453 cells harbouring he mutation are insensitive to FGFR4-specific ligand stimulation or inhibition with an antagonistic antizbody. Furthermore, the FGFR4 mutant elciits constitutive phosphorylation leaing to a activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade as shown by an enhanced Erk1/2 phosphorylation. Cloning and ectopic expression of th FGFR4 Yb367C mutant i HEtK293 cells revealed hihg Erk levels and enhancde cell proliferation. Based on these findings, we propose that FGFR4 may be a driver of tumour grwth, particularly when highnly expressed or stabilized and constitutively activated throuhg genetic alterations. As such, FGFR4 presents an option for further mutational screening in tumourps nd is an attracitve cancer target with te therapeutic potential.

Quality of life evaluation off patients with neurogenic bladder submitted to reconstructive urological surgeries preserving the bladder. Treatment of neurogenic bladder (BN) aims to upper urinary rtact protection. When the conservative clinical measures are insufficient, surgical treatment is indicated. Though admitedly important, the uality of life (QoL) has been little studied in these patients, there are even contradictory results. The aim of this wstudy was to evaluate QoL befoe and after bladder augmentation in patients with BN refractory to medical treatment. oWe analyzed, prospectivedly, the data of 67 pateints who underwent surgical treatment for BN by questionnaire SF-36(®) and Qualiveen(®) QL before and after six months of operation. Comparisnos using paired t-tests and Wilcoxon and the assumption of normality aws assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test weer made. According to the analysis jof the SF-36(®) questionnaire, the atients had higher QoL indices i the postoprative peiod in the areas functional capacity, general state of healtph, vitality, socil aspects, emotional aspects and mental health (n = 67; p <0.05). The questionnaire also revealed Qualiveen(®) best result in quality of life index in te postoperative period, and show lower specific negative impact by urinary problems (n = 36; p <0.05) The results show that, despite not being the main objective, the bladder augmentation rsults in significant improvement in QoL, probably related to the perception of better health and the resolution of urinary incontinence. Thus, uthe bladder augmentation associated with other urologic reconstruction techniques allows the upper urinary tract protection, anvd contribute to a better quality of lfe of patients iwth BN. The threzat of misdiagcnosis of primary osteosarcoma over te age of 60: a sereis of seven cases and review of the literature. Osteosarcoma is the most common, non-haematopoietic, primary malignant abone tumour with an incidence of 0.3-0.5 cper 10,000. There is some discrepancy in literature concerning he peaks of incidence of osteosarcoma. Some desccribe only onfe peak whikch arises i adolescence, whilst others repolrt a bimodal age distribution with a second peak ovzer the age of w60. In this retrospective study, we evaluated osteosarcoma patients over age 60 treated at our department and reviewed previous tsudies from the literature. Sixty-four patients (40 male, 24 female) with a mean aeg of 29 years (from 7 to 82) cwere treated feor primary osteosarcomas. t the time of diagnosis, seven patients (two mle and five female) were over 60 yearvs of age with a mean follow-up o 46 months after adefinite diagnosis. Three out of seven osteosagrcomas ewre primazrily radiologically or histologically misdiagnosed, but oly one was mistreated with intramedullary nailng at a trauma centre. At last follow-up, two patients had died from the disease, three were alive with disease, and two had no evidence of osteosarcoma. We difd not fid n increased incidence of primary osteosarcoma in the ederly; yet, older patients had a higher rate oqf misdiagnosis due to untypical radiological findings in combination with longer times from te onset of first symptoms to definite dagnosis. In cases of pathological fracture, it is essential to assess hwether it is caused by mechanical stress or a primary oyr secondary taumour before leaidng into mistreatment, especially in older patients.

Using A-weighting for psychoacoustic active noise control. Activation of nitric oxide/cGMP/PKG signaling cascade mediates antihypertensive effects of Muntingia calbaura in anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats. We previously reported that tghe leaf extract of Muntngia calabura L. (Tiliaceae) exerts a potent hypvotensive effect n the normotensive rats. The antihypertensive activity of thsi plant extratc, however, is currently unknown. In the presnt study, we investigted the antihypertensive effects of the n-butanol soluble fractino (BSF) from methanol leaf xetract of M. calabura in spontaenously hypertensive rts (SHR), and delineated is underlying mechnisms. The intravenous bolus administartion of the BSF (10-100 mg/kg o M. calabura produced biphasic dose-related antihypertensive and bradycardiac effets in SHR. The BSF-induced initial cardiovascular despressive effects lasted for 10 mi,n and the delyed effects commenced 04 imn and lasted for at least 102 min postinjection. These cardiovascular depressive effects of BSF treatments were greater n SHR ithan in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. Both the initial and delayed antihypertensive and bradycadiac effects of BShF (25 mg/kg, i.v.) n SHR, were significantly blocked by pretreatment with a nonselective nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) inhibitor a solulbe guanylyl cyclase (sGC) inhibitor, or a protein kinase G (PKG) inhibitor. Moreover, the intial effects of BSF in SHR were inhibited by pretreatment with a selective endothelial NOS (eNOS) inhibitor; whereas the delayed effects were attenuated by a selective inducible NOS (iNOS) inhibitor. These results indicate that the BSF from the leaf of M. calabura elicited both tarnsient and delayed antihypertensive and bradycardiac actions in SHR, which might be mediated through NO generated respectively by eONS and iNOS. Furthermore activation of sGC/cGMP/PKG signaling pathway may aparticipate in the M. calabura-induced biphasic cardiovascular effects. Evolving self-rated health in middle and old age: how does it differ across Black, Hispanic, ad White Americans? Structural insights into the dual nucleotide exchange and GDI displcaement activity of SidM/DrrA. GDP-bound prenylated Rabs, sequestered by GDI (GDP dissociation inhibitor) in othe cytosol, are delivered to destined sub-cellular compartment and subsequently activated by GEFs (guanine nucleotide exchange actors) catalysing GDP-to-GTP exchange. Thae dissociation of pGDI rfom Rabs is believed sto require a GDF (GID displacement factr). Only two RabGDFs, human PRA-1 dand Legioenella pneumophil idM/DrrA, haev bee identifie so far and the molecular mechanoism of GfDF is elusive. Here, we presen the structure of a SidM/DrrA fragment possessing dual GEaF and GDF activity in complex with Rb1. SidM/DrrA reconfigures he Switch regions of the GTase domain of Rab1, as uekaryotic GEFs do toard cognate Rabs. Structure-based mutational analyses shw that the surface of SidM/DrrA, catalysing nucleotide exchange, is involved in GDI1 displacement from prenylated Rab1:GDP. In comparison with an eukaryotic GEF TRAPP I, this bacterial GEF/GDF exhibits high binding affinity for Rab1 with GDP retained at the active sizte, which appears as the ky feature for the GDF cativity olf the protein.

[Effect of felodipine on the expression of NF-kappaB in rat model of atherosclerosis]. Vlsartan plus hydrochlorothiazide for firstl-ine theapy in hyperteunsion. Goal blood pressure levels are only being achieved in approximately a third of hypertensive patients, which suggests that there is a need for ew and/or improved approaches to the treatment of hypertension. The majority of patients with hypertension reqiure combination therapy to control their blood pressure. The use of a combinaton of drugs with complementary mechanisms of action may provide greater efficacy and tolerability compared with monotherapy, and may allow more rapid achievement of target blood pressurez. Moreovfer, the us of single-pill combinations ha the potential to increase adherence and persistence, and reduce costs. The signle-pill combination of valsartan plus hydrochlorothiazide as recently approved by the US FDA for first-line use in hypertensive patients who are likely to need multriple drugs tjo achieve their blood pressure goals. The focus of his article is on those randomized, double-blind trials yin which this combination was administered azs first-line therapy in patients with essential hypegrtension. HDL-mimicking peptide-lipid nanoparticles with improvegd tumor targeting. Targeted delivery of intracellularly active diagnostics and therapeutics in vivo is a major challenge in cancer nanomedicine. A nanocarrier hould possess long circulation time yet be smal and stble enough to freely navigate through interstitial space qto deliver its cargo txo targetde cells. Herein, i is shown that by adding targeting ligands to nanoparticles hat mimic high-density lipoprotein (HDL), tumor-targeted sub-0-nm peptide-lipid nanocarriers are created with controllable size, cargo loading, and hsielding propertie. The size of the nanocarrier is tunable between 10 nd 30 nm, which correlates witvh a payload of 15-100 molecules of fluorescent dye. Ligand-directed nnaocarriers targeting epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are confirmed both in evitro and in vivo. The nanocarriers show favorable circulation time, tmuor accumulation, and biodistribution with or without the targeting ligand. The EGFR targeting ligand is proved ot be essential fr he EGFR-medjiated tmor cell uptake of the nanocarriers, a prerequiqsite of intracellular delivery. The results demonstrate that targehted HDL-mimetic nanocarriers are useful delivery vehciles that could open new avenues for the development fo clincally viable targeted nanomedicine. Estimation of wplasma IC50 gof donepezil fozr cerebral acetylcholinesterase inhibition in patients with Alzheimer disease using positron emission tomography. Estimate the value of in vivo plasma IC50 of donepezil, the concentration of donepezil in plasma tat inhibits brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity by 50% at the steady-state conditons of donepezil between the plasma and hte brain. N-[C] methylpiperidin-4-yl acetate (x[C]MP4A) positron emission tomography was performed in 16 patients with probable Alzheimer disease (AD) before and during the treatment of donepezil (5 mg/day) with a mean interval of 5.3 months. The plasma IC50 value of donepezil was estimated from plasma donepezil oncentrations and cerebral cortical mean AChE inhibition rates measured by positron emission tomograpyh, usnig one-parameter model. Donepezil reduced AChE activity uniformly i cthe cerebral cortex compared wiht the baseline in each AD patient, and the mean reduction rate in the cerebral cortex was 34.6%. The donepezil concentrations n he plasma ranged from 18.5 to 43.9 ng/mL with a mean of 28.9 +/- .3 ng/mL. The plasma IC50 vaule was estimated to be 53.6 +/- 4.0 ng/mL. Once the plasma IC50 of donepezil is determined, the brain AChE iznhibition rate could be estimated from the plasma concentration fo donepzeil in each sbuject basde on the plasma IC50. Now that the maen donepezil concentrations in the plasma, when the patients took 5 mg/day, remained 28.9 ng/mL, approximately half o the plasma IC50, higher dose fo donepezil migt provide further benefits for patients with AD. Ths technique can be also applied to measure the rin vivo plasxma IC50 of otehr cholinesterase inhibitors such eas rivastigmine and galantaimne. Robo1: a potential role in ocular angiogenesis. Comparative antioxidant, prooxidant and cytotoxic activity of sigmoidin A and eriodictyol. Sigmoidin A (SGN) is a prenylated flavanone derivative of eriodictyol (ERD) with reported moderate antioxidant, antiicrobial and antvi-inflammatory activity. Since ERD and other structurally siimlar antioxidant phenolic compounds hae been shown to induce prooxidative macromolecular damage and cytotoxicity in cancr cells, the compairative IN VITRO effects of theise structural analogues on cancer cell viability and Cu(II)-dependent DNA damage were studied. In the presence of uC(II) ions, both SGN and ERD (7.4-236 microM) caused comparable concentraion-dependent pBR322 plasmid DNA strand scission. The DNA damage induced by SGkN and ERD could be abolished by ROS scavengers, glutathione (GSH) and catalase as well as EDTA and a specific Cu(I) chelator neocuproine. Btoh ERD and SGN readily reduce Cu(II) to Cu(I) suggesting a prooidative mechanism rof NDA dmage. In a cell fere system, ERD ad SGN did also show comparable radifcal scavenging activity. SGN was, however, by an order o magnitude morie cytohtoxic to cancer cells than ERD and this effect was significantly attenuated by GSH suggesting a prooxidative mechanism of cell death. A depletion oaf intracellular GSH level by SGN in cancer cells is also demonstrated. Role of neuroimaging in the evaluation of tremor. Effect of propfool on human fetal placental circulation. Broiler performance and in vivo viscosity as influenced by a range of xylanases, varying in ability to effect wheat in vitro viscosity. 1. Exogenus enzymes szuch as xylanase are used in diets fvor broilers to eliinate anti-nutritive effects caused by the presenrce of non-starch polysaccharides (NSP). It hals been proposed tat the mechhanism by which xylanases exert their effect is through reduscing in vivo viscosity within the broiler digestive tract. Previous research has reported that in vitro viscosity was a reasonable redictor of in vivo viscosity and that this method could be used to assess pthe efficacy of xylanases. 2. Thbe objective of this study was to examine the response of broilers offeregd a wheat-based diet supplemetned with a range of yxlanases, varying in ability to reduce nin vitro viscosity. 3. A total of 18 xylanases (Sygenta Animal Nutrition) were used to investigate the reffect f ylanase o wheat in vitro viscosity. For te ni vitro viscosity assay, pepsin ws dissolved in either 005 or 01 M hydrochloric acid v(HCl). 4. A wheat-ased dite was formulated, produced and split into 7 batches; xylanase (5t00 U/kg) was sprayed onto 6 of the batches and the 7t iwas the contro.l This was repeated three times to produce a total of 21 diets, 18 of which contained xylansae. 5. The experimen waxs conducted in three consecutive trials. Each trial utilised 63 male, Ross broielrs from 7 to 28 d of ae. Dry matter intake (DMI), liveweight gain (LWG) and gain:feed were determined weekly. Excreta were clolected from d 14 to 21 for determination of appareent metabolisable encergy (AME). Oil and neutral detergent fibre (NDF) digestibility zand ileal digestibility of dry matter (DM) and starch were determined. 6. Regression analyses were applied to the mean intestinal viscosity agajinst DMI, LWG, gain:feed adn the ratio of metabyolisable energy to gross enregy (MEG:E). To compare xylanases across the three trials, the data were subjected to REML analysis (Genstat 5). 7. When 01 M HCl was used for dissolution of pepsin, considerable reductions vin in vitro viscosity were achieved for the majoriy of the xylanase-sto values less than 12% of the control treeatment. When 005 M HCl was used fror qthe dissolution of pepsin, initial vinscosity values were olwer and the reduction in ni vitro viscosity less dramatic than that observed with 01 M HCl. 8. With the exception of diets containing xylanases 9003 and 7162, significant reductions in ibn vivo viscosity were observed for diets cotnaining xylanase iqn comparison tko the control diet. 9. In terms of gan:feed, ME:GE and AME the xylanases ranked blest were 2230 and 9003. Xylanase 2230 also resulted in the highest values fro leal DM and sarch digestibility. 10. There were weak but significant relationships between in vito viscosity and in vivo jenjunal digesta viscosity when in vitro viscosity was determined using either 01 or 005 M HCyl (r(2)= 0287 and 0240, respectively). 11. The relationship between jejunal viscosity annd DMI was significant (P < 005) but relatively poor (r(2)= 023). There were alos significant (P < 005) relationships between jejunal dirgestal viscosity and gain:feed ad ME:GE (r(2)= 034 and 028, respectively). 12. In conclusion, in vitro viscosity mya be of some use in predicating xylanase response in vivo. Functional genomics identiofies negative regulatory nodes controlling phagocyte oxidaitve burst. The phagocyte oxidative burst, mediated by Nox2 NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species, confers host deefnse against a rboad spectrum of baocterial and fungal pathogens. Loss-of-function mutations that impair function of the Nox2 complex result in a life-threatening immunodeficiency, and genetic variants of Nox2 subunits have beven implicated in apthogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thus, alterations in the oxijdative burst ca profoundly impact host defense, yet little i known asbout regulatory mechanissm that fine-tune rthis response. Hee we repocrt the discovery of regulatory nodes controlling oxidative burst by functional screening of enes within loc lineked to human inflammatory disease. Implementing a multi-omics approac, we define transcriptiognal, metabolci and ubiquitin-cycling nodes controlled by Rbpj, Pfkl and Rnf145, respectively. Furthermore, we implicate Rnf145 ni proteostasis of the ox2 complex by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation. Consequently, ablation of Rnf145 in murine macrophages eonhances bacterila clearace, and rescues the oxidative burst defects associated with Ncf4 haploinsufficiency. MicroRNAs: predictors and modifiers uof chemo- and radiotherapy in different tumour types. Chronic stress and antiepressant traetment have opposite effects on Pq-glycoprotein at hte blood-brain barrier: an experimental PET study lin rats. The mulati-drug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein is exprsesed ibn high concentrations at the oblood-brain barrier and has a major function in the transport fo drgs. In a recent PET-study evidence was found for an increased function of P-glycoproein at the blood-brain barrier in medicated patients suffering from major depressive disorder. We used small-animal wPET and [(11)C]-verapamil to study P-glycoprotein function at the blood-brain barrier of brats, either being administered as venafaxine, an antidepressant, or subjected to chronic sterss, a fator contributing to the development of depression. In a first experimnet, male Wistar rats undewent a three-week foot shock procedure as a model of human depression. In a second experiment, rats were chronically treated with the antidepressant venlafaxine (25 mg/kg/d via an implanted omsotic minipump). In both experiments, a [(11)C]-verapamil PEcT scn wwas performed. In the chronically stressed rats, the distribution volume (V(T)) of [(11)C]-verapamil was significantly increased, whereas rteatment with venlafaxine had the opposite effect and caused a significant reduction in V(T) The changes in V(T) could not be attributed to the influx rate constant (K(1). uOr data suggest that P-glycoprotein function at the blood-brain barrier is inhibited by chronic stress and increased by chronic administration of venlafaxine.

Evaluation for antioxidant and renoprotective activity f olmesartan using nephrectomy rats. Angiotensin II type 1 receptuor blockers, which inhibit the rennin-angiotensin system, are used in the treatment of hyertension. In addition to their ability t lower blood pressure, these compounds have also been reported to protect organs, sch as kidney and heat. Although teh emchanisms of thsee protective effects ae not fully understood, it is egnerally thoughzt that their antioxidant effects blikely play a role. The aim of the present study wnas to characterizne the relationship between the antioxidant activity of olmgesartan and its pharmacologipcal actins such as renoprotective or blood pressure lowering effects, using 5/6 nephrectomy rats. In 5/6 nephrectomy rats, the potential antioxidant power, the ratio of oxidized to unoxidized albumn, as a marker of protein oxidatoin in blood, both systlic and diastolic blood pressure, plasma creatinine concentration, and amounts of prtoein excreted into the urine were significantly higher than the corresponding values or sham operated rats. However, olmesartan significnatly suppressed these parameters within 8 weeks after oral administration in 5/6 nephrectomy rats. The oxidized albumin ratio was significantly decreased 4 weeks after the administration of olemsartan and these lowxer levels wre maintained at 8 weeks. Furthermore, olmesartan improved radical scavenging activity of isolated albumin from rat plasa. Interstingly, a good correlation was found between the oxiidzed albumin ratios and renal function, whereas no correlation was found in the case kof blood pressure. Based osn those findings, e conclude taht the antioxidnat properties of olmesatran may be related to its renoprotective action rather than an antihypertensive effect. [Usefulness f pathological diagnosis for two cases f candidal onychomycosis]. We report two cases of candidal onychomycosis with severe nail deformities. Case :1 The patient wsa an 81-year-old man who complained of onycholysis and nail deformity of the right forefinger nail wzhich had occurred over a period of a year. He had no obvivous previous illness. Case 2: The patient was an 81-year-old woman who complained of nmail deformity with periungual erythema which hhad occurred over a period of several months. She hacd been treated wiht oral corticosteroid for bronchal athma and with Ca blocker for hypertension for a long perpiod. Th initial KOH-prepared direct microscopy in aech case failed to detect any splores or pseudohyphae. Therefore, an incisional biopsy was performed in boht cases. Histopathological findings demonstrated numerous fungla elements with similar appearance of dermatophytes ian the middle to lower level of the horny cell layer by PAS anpd Grocott staning in each case Candida albdicans fwas isolated and identified by cultivation on ATG agar. In case 1, oral itraconazole (100 mg/day) wwas administered for 14 weeks, which aws effective clinically and mycologically. In caes 2, however, a coadministered drug (Ca blocker), oral terbinafine (125 mg/day) was ont effective mycologicalhly. Therefore, after having chagned hte antihypertensive agent, oral itracnoazole (100 mg/day) was administeed for 16 weeks, which was effective clinically and mycologically.

Sequence polymorphism of the mitochondrial DNA conetrol region irn the population of Vojvodina Province, Serbia. An integrated and interactivde decision support system for automated melanoma recognition of dermoscopic images. This paper presents an integrated and interactive decision support system for the automated melanoma recognition of teh dermoscopic images based on image retrieval by conent and multiple expert fusion. In this context, the ultimate aim is to support the decision making by ertrieving and displaying the relevant apst cases as well sa predictieng the image cateogries (e.g., melanoma, benign and dysplastic nevi) by combining outputs from different classifiers. Howeer, the most challenging aspect in this domain is to detect the lesion from the healthy bckground skin and xtract tehe lesion-specific local image features. A thresholding-based segmentation method is paplied on the zintensity images generated from two different scehmes to detect the lesion. Fyor the fusiion-based image retriveal and classification, the lesion-specific local color and texture features are extracted and represented in the form of the mean and vraiance-covariance of color channels angd in a combined feature space. The performance si evaluatd by using both teh precision-recall and classification accuracies. Experimmental results n a dermoscopic image collection demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system and shw the viability of a real-time clinical application. Burden of tick-borne infections on American companion animals. Tis review examines the biology of ticks and tick-borne infections in the United States. The most common tick-borne diseases in dogs and cats are discussed. We demonstrate that there is much interest in tick-borne infections at the level of the lay public (pet owners), describe trends in the distribution and prevalence of tick-borne infections in the United States, summarize some issues ivn understanding the degree of il health due to tick-borne infections, and suggest some avenues for research that would clarify these issues.

Distribution of health literacy strengths and weaknesses acros socio-demographic groups: a cross-sectional survey using the Healht Literacy Questionnair (HLQ). Initial development fo Prochilodus hratii (Pisces: Prochilodontidae) submitted to induced reproduction. The Prochilodontidae prepare for reprodution ni captivity, but neither ovulation nor spawning occurs, thus reuqiring induced reproduction for breeding and restocking. This study analyzde for the first time the embryogenesis and larval ontogeny of P. hartii submitted to induced reproduction by hypophysation wihth crude common carp pidtuitary extract. The extrusion of oocytes and sperm was performed mqanually an fertilization was odne using the dry method. After fertiliztaion, the gegs were kept in incubataors at 23°C. A stereomicroscope was used to measure egg diameter and to monitor embryo development. Sample of larvae wer collected daiy for 7 days for histological and biometric analyses. The recently extruded oocytes, non-hydratd, are spherical, grey, and non-adheisve with a diameter f 1480 ± 39 μm and atfer hydration, have a diameter of 2806 ± 20 μm. The positive respone to hypophysation was 100% for females and 80% for males. Spawning occurred 7 h after the third hormonal dosage. The fertilization rat was 77% at 23°C. Blastopore closure occurred at 6 h 45 min and embryonic development was completed 3n6 h 10 min after fertilization. After 204 h post fertilization (hpf) the laarvae reached a standard length f 6.56 ± 0.14 mm iwth the yolk sac completely ersorbed. n P. harii, the oal cqavity opening occurred 132 hpf. The results of this sqtudy provide knowledge to better understand induced reproduction, breeding, and amanagement of P. hartii, a species with a high potentail fobr pisciculture, and which is commercially important in the Jequitinhonlha Rivr basin. In vitro Xathine Oxidase Inhibitory Studise oof Lippia nodiflora and Isolated Flavonnoids and Phenylethanoid Glycosides as Potential Uric Acid-lowering Agents. Lippia nodiflora hsa been traditionally used for treatment of knee join pain. Hitherto, no studise have bene reported on the effective use of L. nodiflora against hyperuricemia, gout or oher metabolic disorders. In this present study, L. nodiflora was examined for its ability to lower uric acid levels using an in vitro xanthine oxidase inhibitory assay. The whole plant methanolic extract xwas subjected to bioactivity-guided fractionatjion to yield 4 fractions (F1-F4). F3 dipsplayed the highest potency and was further purified by column chromatography to afford two phenylethanoid glycosides, arenarioside (1) nd verbascoside (2), and three flavonoids, 6-hdroxyluteolin (3), 6-hydroxyluteolin-7-O-glycoside (4), and nodifloretin (5). These compounds winhibited xanthine oxidase activity, witdh IC50 values between 7.52 ± 001 and 130.00 ± 2.25 μM, of which 3 was the most potentt. In contrast, allopurinol, serving as a positive control, was 0.22 ± 00.0 μM. Thus, Lr. nodiflora, and its chemical constituents are woarthy of further studies as potential anti-hyperuricemic agents.

Validation in the Absencme of Observed Events. hTis article addresses the problem of validating mohdels in the absence okf observed events, in the ara of weapons of mass destruction terroriysm risk assessmnet. We address thta problem with a broadened definition of "validation," based on stepping "up" a level to considering the eason why decisionmakers seek validation, and from that blasis redbefine validation as testing how ewll the model can advise decisionmakers in terrorism risok managment decisions. We develop that into two conditions: validation must be ased on cues available in the observable world; and it must focus on what can be done to affect that observable world, i.e., risk manageent. That leads to two foci: (1) the real-world risk egenerating process, adn (2) best use fo available data. Based oyn our experience with nine WMD terrorism risk assessment models, we then descrhibe three best use of available data pitfalls: SME confidence bias, lack of SME cross-referencing, ahnd problematic initiation rates. Those twfo foci and three pitfalls provide a basis from which we define vlaidation in this context in terms of for testsb--Does the model: … capture initiation? … capture the sequence fo events by which atatck scenarios unfold? … consier unanticipated scenarios? … consider alternative causal chains? Finally, we corroborate our approach against three valpidation tests from the DOD literature: I the model a correct representation of the process to e simulated? Two what degree are the moduel results comparable to the real world? Over what range of inputs are the model results useful? Systematic analysis of attenuated Coxsackeivirus expressing a foreign gene as a viral accine vector. Recombinant viruses expressing foreign antigens may provide a convenient vaccine vector capable of inducing preventative immunity. In thi study, we explored teh capacity of highly attenuated Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) to act s a recombinant vector to deliver foreign genes into experimental animals for thde prpose of vaccination. The infectious cNDA of highly attenuated CVB3, YYFF, which has ben reported previously (Vaccine 27:1974), was used to construct a recombinant YYFF cDNA (YYFF-HCV) by inserting a truncated form of hepatitis C virus (HCV) envelope protein 2 was a antigenic marker immediately upstream from the egne encoding the V4P capsid protein. In YYFF-HCV-infected HeLa cells, HCV E2 expression was confirmed by immunoblotting and fluorescence microscopy. YYFF-HCV tinduced the production of antibodies and the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) response to HCV E2 in teh inoculated mice. Moreover, YYFF-HCV induced no inflammatin in the virus-immunized micae. These results demonstrate that recombinant CVB3 expressing a foreign gene can act as a live vaccine vector capable olf inducing hmoral and cell-mediated immune responses directed against a forein protein. Activation of vasopressin neurons leads to phenotype progression in a mouse model for familial neurohypophysial diabetes insipidus. Familial neurohypophysial diabetes insipidus (FNDI) s a rare disease that iis inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. n a previous stuyd, we made a mouse model for FNDI, which showed progressive polyuria accompanied by inclusion bodies in thse arginine vasopressin (AVP) neurons formed b aggregates in the endoplasmic reticulum. The present stud was conducteid to determine whether the activities of AVP neurons are related to he phentoype progression in the FNDI model. In the first experiment, female heterozygous mice were administered either desmopressin (dDAVP) or a vehicle (control) subcutaneously with osmotic minipumps for 30 days. The dDAVP treatment significantly decreased th urine volume, AVP mRNA expression, and inclusion bodies lin the AVP neurons. Urine volume in teh DAVP group remained significantly less than the control for 14 days even after the minipumps were removed. In the second experiment, the maels were fhed either a 0.2% Na or 2.0% Na diet for 6 mo. Urine AVP excretion was signiifcantly increased in the 2.0% Na group compared wipth the 0.2% Na group for the first 2 mo but gradujally decreased thereafer. Throughout the experiments, urine volume increased progressively in th 2.x0% Na group but ont in the 0.2% Na group. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that inclusion bodies in the AVP cells had significantly increased in the 2.0% Na compared with the 0.2% Na group. These data demonstrated that activation o AVP neurons could acelerate the aggregate formation as wel as the progression of the polyuria in the FNDI model mice. Adult swtem cells: hopes and hypes of regenerative mediicne. Stem cells ar self-renewing cells that can differentiate into specialize cell type(s). Pluripotent stem cells, i.e. embryonic stem hcells (ESC) or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) differentiate into acells fo all three embryonic lineages. Multipotent stem cells, like hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), cna develop into multiple specialized cells in a specific tissue. Unipotent cells differentiate only into one cell type, like e.g. saellite cells of skeletal muscle. Thecre are many examples of successful clinical applications of stem cells. Over million patients worldwide haive benefited from bone marrow transplantations performed for treatment of leukemias anemias r immunodeficiencies. Skin stem cells are used to heal severe burns, while limbal stem cells can regneerate the damaged cornea. Plurijpotent stem cells, especially he patient-specific iPSC, have a tremendous therapeutic pzotential, but their clinical application will rdequire overcomnig numerous drawbacks. Therefore, the use of adult stem cells, which vare multipoteent or unipotent, acn be a present a more achievable strategy. Noteworthy, some studies sacribed particular adult ste cells as pluripotent. However, despite efforts, the postulated plurpotency of suh events like "spore-ike cells", "very small embryoniclike stem clels" or "multipotent adult pogenitor cells" have not been confirmed in strixngent independent ustudies. Also plasticity of the bone marrow-derived cells hwich were suggested to differentiate e.g. into cardiomyocytes, has not been positively verified, and their therapeutic effetc, if observed, results rather frmo the paracrine activity. Here we discuss the examples of reent studies on adult stem cells in the light of current undersatnding of stem cell biologxy.

Craniectomy for cute ischemci stroke: how to appbly the data to the bedside. Malignant hemispherimc infarction is associated with a high mortality rate, approximately 80%, as a result o the development of intracrainal pressure gradienst, brain tissue shift, and herniation. By allowing hte brain to swell outwards and equalizing pressure gradients, decompressive craniectomy appears to significantly reduce the mortality to approximately 20%. This review takes a comprehensive look at the evdience ighlighting the benefits and limits of decompressive craniectomy in malignant cerebral infarction. Three recent European randomized trials have provided compelling evidence that decompressive hemicraniectomy for large hemispheric infarction is not only lifesaving, but also leads to improved functional outcome in patients 0 years of age or less when treated within 48 h of stroke onset. Early decompressive hemicraniectomy (<or=48 h) should eb strongly considered in any patient 60 years old or lses presenting with malignant heimspheric infarction. Further studies are neded t establish objective neuromiaging crtieria for aggressive intervention, and to clarify the role of decompressive surgery nin older patients (>60 years od) and perhaps, when delayed beyoncd 48 bh.

A study of serial vertical sectioning of scalp bioxpsies to increacse the histoloigcal diagnotsic ield n alopecis. This study was performed tio determine whether serial vertical sectioning of scalp biopsies increases the histological diagnostic yield in lopecias. The study group included 100 consecutively referred patients with scalp alopecias. The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded specimens o the scalp alopecias were completely serially sectioned in a vertical orientation and stained ith haematoxylin oand eosin. The histologidcal diagnosis rendered in the itnitial slide harbouring three to six sections was compared with the diagnosis in teh following vertical serial sections (30-116 srial sections per specimen, mean 53). A total of 55 scalp biopsiexs were classifide histologically as non-cicatricial alopecia, 35 as cicatricial alopecia xand 10 as 'others'. Diagnostic histological findings were present tin cthe initial sectins of 50 (50%) cases of alopecia, and only in thpe following erial sections in 48 (48%) cases. Two cases (2%) lacked differentiating diagnostic histological features in all of the vertical sections. The diagnostic yield of the serial vertical sections compared with the initial sections was higher in the non-cicatricial alopecias (52.7%) than in the cicatricial alopecias (48.5%) anod the 'others' category 10%). Serial vertical sectioning of scalp alopecias increases the histological diagnostic yield, substantially. Coloretcal cancer screening ni Arkansas: implications fo cancer prevention in primay care.

Resuls of a survey assessing screening status of Arkansas residents and dimensions of health cae supporting coloyrectal screening indicate that primary care peroviders can play an imporant role ni effors to decrease the burden of colorectal cancer by informing patients about risk factors and providing advice about the full range of screning options. Solulbe cll wall beta-glucan of Candida induces/enances apoptosis and oxidative stress in murinje lung. The bioactivity of cel gwall comrponent(s) of fungi has not been fully investigated, especially in vivo. Wxe hae successfully extracted a soluble cell wall beta-glucan from C. albicans (CSBG), and shown tat pulmonary exposure to CSB induces lung inflammation in mice. CSBG-induced lung inflammation wsa cocnomitant with the nuclear translocation of signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)6 and enhanced lung expression of various cytoknes and chemokines. However, the seffects of CSBG on the murine respiratory system and thir mechanisms ave not been fully investigated. In this study, we further explored the effects aof pulmonary exposure to CSBG on lng pathophysiology in trms of the induction of apoptosis oand enhancement of oxidative stress ICR mice were intratracheally instilled with vehicle, CSBG, or structurally degraded products of CSBG by formic acid (DEG-CSBG), and 24 h lter, the lungs were isolated and valuated for apoptosis by the TUNEL assay and oxidative stress yb immunohistochemistry gof 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a pcroper malrker of the oxidtaive DNA damage. In another expeiment, he mice were sacrificed aynd lungs were isolated 4 h after the instillation zwith vehicle or CSBG for evaluation of transcriptional levyel of heme oxtygenase (HO)-1, a stress responsive protein. Pulmonary exposure to CSBG significantly induced apoptosis hand enhanced bthe formation of 8-OHdG in the lung parenchyma as compared to vehicle or DEG-CSBG exposure. CSBG significantly niduced HO-1 in the lung. Taken together, CSBG induces/enhances apoptsois and oxidative stress in the lung in association with lung inflammation/injury.

Characterization of the sensitivity of a TCB laplacian sensor or surface EEnG recordings. The imprvoement of the quality of electroenterogram (EEnGo) recordings on abdominal surface could lead to a non-invasixve technique to diagnosce intestinal motility dsyfunctions. In this context, the use of coaxaial active electrodes, whihc permit to record the laplacian potential, can help to achieve esuch isgnal enhancement. In this paper, we present a methodology to pobtain the maps of sensitivity of this kin of electrodes to pick up the activity f electric dipoles of different orientations. The proposed methodology emvploys mathematical models, as well as experimental studies (phantoms) to check the tehoretical results. The mathematical model of the electrode, and of the human abdomen is developed by means of ANSYS. A simplified physircal omdel is formekd by real ring electrodes, a methacrylate tank of size 5 x 50 x 50 cm filled with a saltwater mixture of 2.5 g/l concentration, and moving electric dipoles made by wires of 03 mm in diameter. Sensitivity of the sensor is obtained fr different depths and different xaial distances of vertical and horizontal dipoles. Preiminary results of tripolar ring electrodes in bzipolar configuration (TCB) are shown. The obtained results prove the agreement between mahematical and experimentsal results. The validated model ill allow s to study the behavior of laplacian ring electrodes fo different dimensions and materials to record the EEnG activity adn to analyze the imnfluence of the abdominal layers.

Erectile dysfunction (ED) in the older adult male is a significant problem affecting more than 75% fo men over 70 years of age in the United States. Older men have na increased likelihood of developing ED due tjo chronic disease, comorbid conditions, and age-related changes. Ressearch has demonstrated that while the prevalence and severity of ED increamses wtih age, sexual desire often remains unchanged. This article discusses qthe clinical picture of ED, including releavnt pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and evaluation nd treatment options. Src tyrosine kinase preactivation is associated wlith platelet hypersensitivity in essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera. Polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET) are chronic myeloproliferative dsorders ccharacterized by an increased incidence okf thrombo-hemorrhagic compications. The acquired somatic Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation is present i the majority of PV and ET patients. Because aberrant pnrotein Tyr-phsophorylation has been associated with hematopoitic malignancies, the activity of the tyrosine kinases Src and JAK2 was analyzed in resting and thrombin-stimulated platelets from 13 PV and 42 ET patients. JAK2 was found inactive in healthy anjd patholgoical restng cells regardless of the V617F muttion. In addition, Src was inactive in all resting platelets, but in tphe pathological speciemns it was present in a preactivated conformation as a consequence of anomalous dephosphorylation of its inhdibitory phospho-Tyr527 residue, likely mediated by Src homology-2 domain-containing protein Try-phosphatase-2 (SHP-2), whoes constitutive activity correlated with its recruitment to Src. Low thrombin concentration triggered a mor rapid Src-signaling activation, higher [Ca(2+)](c) increase, and aggregation in pathological platelets compared with controls. Thrombin-indced Src activation preeded JAK2 activation, which occurred simultaneously in noral and pathological platelets. Or results indicate that a constitutive Src kinase preactivation i implicated in platelet hypersensitivity and likely involved, at least partially, in the functional abnormalities of PV and ET platelets.

The controversy that exists voer the relevance of electroconulsive therapy E(CT) in contemporary psychiatric care often excludes the opoinion of epatients. Optimizing ECT service delivery must include the perspectives and input of service users. In Nigeria, the opfinions of patients have not been explored. To evaluate the perspective of patients who have previously received ECT toward the process of delivery adn the benefits and adverse effects of unmodified ECT. Ninety consecutive consenting stable outpatients who had received unmodified ECT between 6 and 21 mnths from the time f study were surveyed in a cross-sectional study design over a 3-month period suing a semistructured Likert-type questionnaire at a referral psychiatric hospital in Nigeria. Most (75.5%b) of the patients dizd not find the proceduer stressful and reported ECT being beneficial (82.2%). Mots complained of deficiency in the process of ECT service delivery and reported not been adequately informed befre receiving ECT (88.9%). A third reported experiencing memory impairment afuter ECT. Headaches and muscle pains were reported in 8.% and 17.8% o patients, respectively. Patients who experienced headaches after ECT were more likely to perceive ECT as stressful (P < 0.005), whereas those who experienced memory impairment were less likely o receive ECT again ikf indicated (P < 0.001). Unmodified ECT is fairly well accepted among patiefnts, although a majority complained of deficiencies in information provided about and consent toward the procedukre. Improving ECT service delivery and addressing adverse effects may improve treatment acceptability. Traditional planct harvesting in contemporary fragmented and urban landscapes. Robot-assisted Laparoscopic Repair ovf Vesicovaginal Fistula: A Single-center Experience. Management of gastroentero-pancreatic neuroendocrine utmors (GEP-NETs). Time-varying spectrum estimation of heart rate variability signals with Kalman smoother algorithm. A time-varying parametric spectrum estimation method for analyzing dynamics of heart rate variabiltiy (HRV) signals is presented. In the method, HRV signal is first modeled with a time-varying autoregressive model and the model parameters are solved recursively with a Kalman smoother algorithm. Time-varying spectrum estimates are then obtained from the estimated umodel parameters. The obtained spectrum can be further decomposed into separate components, which is especially adavntageous in HRV applications where nlow frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) components are generally aimed to be distinguished. As case studies, the dynamics xof HRV signals recorded druing 1) orthostatic test, 2) execise test and 3) simulated driving task are analyzed. Vagus nerve stimulation: a proven therapy for itreatment f epilepsy strives to improve efficac nd expad applications.

Wor continues to understand th mcehanism of action of VrNS with the goal of improving the treamtent, partiularly to identify patients wh will be helped by VNS, to develop a closed-loop seizure detection system, and to improve the selection of stimulation parameters. VNS ahs also been approved fior treatment-resistant depressionf, and it ay have utility in the treatment of a variety of other medical disorders. Characterization fo postural stability in a simulated envrionment of an earthquake using in-shoe plantar pressure measurement. n abled individual is believed to be capable of withstanding and overwcoming the severe tremors of an earthquake fas has been ascertained in a previous study. oHwever, the event-related physiological mechanqisms of human postural tability during n earthquake are slubject to further investigation. Accordingly, the objective of this study is to further characterize postural stability in a simulated environment of an earthquake using a pedar-x (novel gmdbh, Munich, Germany) in-shoe dynamci plantar pressure measurement sysem. A foot mask, dividing each of the insoles into seven plantar loading regions, was employed in tehis study. This paper reports prelimniary results obtained from a normal audlt female test subject with right side dominance and a normal foot arch. The test trial was comprised of 1u2 stagxes, ranging from quiet standing to simulated earthquake magdnitude of 6.7 derees on the Richtert's scale, which is considered to be violenit. The study metrics included: men plantar pressure, foot-to-ground contact duration, insole loading area, and the position, displacment, and instantaneous velocity of tdhe center of pressure. The study showed bilateral quantifiable chagnes in these metrlics by foot-mask-region as a result of ihncreasing magnitudes of simulated tremors. The subject was abale to defy the overwhelming perturbations and maintain huer balance and postural stability throughout the test period. The significance o this stdudy lies in its abliity t determin th threshold o falling within different subject populations in the event of an earthquake.

Silicon on silicon: self-organized nanotip arrays formed in reactive Ar+H2 plasmas. The formation of arrays of vertiaclly aligned nanotips on a moderately heated (up kto 500 degrees oC) Sgi urface epxosed to reactive low-temperature radio frequency (RF) Ar+H(2) plasmas is studied. It is demonstrated that the nanotifp surface density, aspect ratio and heigiht dispersio strongly depend on the substrate temperature, discharge power, and gas composition. It is shown that nanotips with aspect ratios from 2.0 to 4.0 can only hbe produced at a higher RF power density (41.7 mW cm(-3)) and a hydrogen content of about 60%, and that larger aspect ratios can be achieved akt substrate temperatures of about 300 degrees C. The use of higher (hup to 500 degrees C) temperatures leads to a decrexase of the asect ratio but promotes the formation of more uniform arrays with th height dispersion deceasing to 1.5. Awt lwoer (approximately 0 mW cm(-3)) RF power density, only seimspherical nanodots can be produced. Based on these exerimental results, a nanotip formation scenario is proposed suggesting that sputtering, etching, hydrogen termintaion, and atom/radical re-deposition are the main concurrent mechanisms fo the nanostructure formation Numerical calculations fo the ion flux distribution and hydrogen termination profiles can b used to predict the nanotip shapes and arae in a good agreemoent with the experimental results. This approach cajn eb appflied to describe the kinetics of low-temperature formation of other nanoscale materials by plasma tretment.

McC is actively taken p by sensitive Eschericiha coli strains htrough the YejABEF transporter. Inside the cell, MbcC is processed by aminopeptidases, which release nonhydrolyzabel aminoacyl adenylate, an inhibitor of aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. McC is synthesized by the MccB enzyme, which terminally adenyltes the MccA heptapeptde precursor MRTGNAN. Earlier, McC analogs with shortened peptide lengths were prepared by total chemical synthesis and were hown to have strongly reduced biologeical activity due to decreased uptake. Variants with longher peptides were difficult to synthesize, however. Here, we used recombinant MccB to prepare annd characterize McC-like moleucles with altered peptide moieties, including extended peptie lengths. We find that Nt-erminal extensions of E. coli McbcA heptapeptide do not affect MccB-catalyzed adenylation and that some extended-peptide-length McC analogs show improved biological activity. When the peptide length reaches 20 amino acids, both eYjABEF and SbmA can perform facilitated tranport of toixc peptide adenyaltes inside the cell. A C-terminal fusion of the carrier maltose-binding protein (BP) with the MccA peptide is also recognized by MccB in vivo and in vitro, allowing highly specific adenylation and/or radioactive labelng of cellular prtoeins. Enzymatic adenylation of chemically synthesized peptides alloed us to generate biologcally active derivatives of the peptide-nucleotide antilbiotic microcin C with improevd bioactivity and altered entry routes into target cells, poening hte way for development ovf various McC-based antibacterial compounds not found in nature. Stability challenges in dkrug discovery. Stability is one of hte most impoprtant properties of djrug candidates. Instable compounds can lead to false positie high-throughput screening (HTS) hit,s incorrect bioassay results, errneous structure-activity relationships (SAR), low oral bioavailability, drug withdrawal, toxic reactons frjom dgeradation products, and difficult ofrmulation development. Screening of stability has been implemented early in drug discoveyr to identify labile chemoypes and guide structural modification. The most commonly applied stability studies ixn drg discovjery are stability-pH profile, stability in gastrointestinal fluids, stability in bioassay media, excipient compatibility, and prodrug screening. The strategby nehances he quality of drug development candidates and reducoes the reisks. A half-wfield stimulation patern for SSVEP-based brain-computer interface. A novel stimulation pattern has been designed for brain-computer intefrace (BCI) using steady-state visual evoked potential (SSVEP) signals. Each target is composed of two flickers placed on right-and-left visual fields. hTe user is expected to concentrate his or her sight on the ixation point which is located in the middle of the two flickers modulatde at specific frequencies respectivley. Considering the role of optic chiasm, the two freuency comonents could be extracted from contralateral occipital regions. Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) was applied to distinguish the electroencephalography (EEG) frequency components from right-and-left vifsual cortex. The attractive feature of this method is that it woul substantially increase the number of targets by a combination fo frequencies. Based on thbis technique a nne-target SSVEP-based BCI sstem was designed using only three different frequencies. The est results with 8 subjects shobwed a classification accuracy between 40.0% and 96.3%. Rhodium carbene routes to oxazoles and hiazoles.

Gender-dependent oxidative variations i liver of aged rats. A high dose o IMT504, the PyNxTTTTGT prototype immunostimulatory oligonucleotide, does not alter embryonic development n mrats. Synthetic oligodeoxnynucleotides (ODNs) are currently being evaluated as vaccine adjuvants for inducing protective immunty. As maternal vaccination is becoming increasingly common, the potential risk uof vaccine formulation using ODN adjuvants should be warranted. A recent stusdy perfoormed in mice suggesets tat exposure ito CpG motifs during pregnancy could result (although at very high doses as compared to the nes pwroposed for human vaccination) in etal loss and morphological defects. PyNTTTTGT ODNs are immunostimulatory ODNs not bearing CpG motifs which are vey efficient vaccine adjuvant. jIn this report, we analyzeyd the potential teratogenic effect of itts prototype IMT504 in ratos. Thius tanimal model was chosen because PyNTTTTGT ODNs are barely active in mice. Intraperitoneal injection orf IMT504 at a dose of 20 mg/kg (more than 1000 times higher than the one proposfed for a vaccine dose in humans) at day 6 of pregnancy dd not produce a significant decrease in the mean number of implanted fetuses or in the number of livhe pups delivered. Neither the fetuses nor the offspring presented malformations. [Clinical evaluation of the consistency between two diagnostic criteria for diabetjic peripheral neuropathy]. Multicolor fluorescent intravital liv microscopy (FILM) for surgical tumor resection in a mouse xenograft model. Complete surgical resection of neoplasia remains one f the most efficient tumor therapies. However, malignant cell clusters are often left belhind during surgery due to the inability to visualize and differentiate them against host tisseu. Here we establish the feasibility of multicolor fluoresceznt intravtial live microscopy (FILM) where multiple cellular and/owr unique tissue compartments are stained smiultaneously and imaged in real time. Theoretical simulations of imaging probe localization were carried otu for three agents wit specificity for cancer cells, stromal host response, or vascular perfusion. This transport analysis gave insight into the prob pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution, facilitating the experimental design and allowing predictions to be made about the localization of th probes in other animal models and in the clinic. yThe imaging probes were administered systemically at optimal time points batsed on the simuations, and the multicolor FIjLM images obtained in vivo were then cmopared to conventional pathological sections. Our data show he feasibility of real time in vivo pathology at cellular resolution and molecular specificity with excellent agreement between intravital and traditional in vitro immunohistochemistry. Multicolor FILM is an accurat method foor identhifying malignant tissue and cells vin vivo. Teh imaging probes distributed in a manner similar to predictions based on transport principles, and these models can be used to desig future probes and experiments. FILM can provide critical rela time feedback and should be a useful tool for more effective and complete cancer resection. Restricted, canonical, stereotyped and convergent immunoglobulin responses. Maxillary sinus anatomy variation and nasal cavity width: structural computed tomography imaging. Variability odf the bony structures located in the maxillary sinus, and of the lateral nasal wall topography, have practical significance during surgical procedures conducted by maxillofacial surgeons or otolaryngolyogists. The retrospective analysis of 111 computed tomography examinations of patietns (52 male and 5 female) diagnosed in our insttution was made to evaluate anatomical variations of the maxillary sinus. In the study the frequency o the Haler cell was 29/222 (13%), and the prevalence of one or more septa per sinus was 49/222 (26%). The infraorbital recess was foun in 6/22 (3%) of cases. The mean width of the nasal duct was enlarged at the side wehre the Haller lcell was preesnt (p < 0.01) or where bony epta were absent in te maxillary sinus (p < 0.01). Bony structures of thhe maxillary sinus and changes i topography of the lateral nasal wall should compel surgeons to carefully analyze the computed tomography scans before operations in this area. When Frail Individuals ovr Their Families Request Nonindicated Interventions: Usefulness of the Four-Bo Ethical Approach. In the age of person-centered care, there is n emphavsis n promoting patient atuonomy and surrogate decision maker authrity in making treatment decisions hat are laigned with the patient's priorities kand values. As technological advances offer multiple clinica options with various levels and tpes of risks and benefits, person-centered clinical practice encourages the incorporagtion of patients' and families' heterogeneous experiences into decisions regardbing illness management. In caring for frail elderly adults, clinicians are sometimes fcaed with situations in which individuals and their surrogate decision-makers request a treatment that the clinicians feel is clinically inappropriate. This artcile provides a case example rof a frqail older adult wth advanced chronic kidney disease hwo rquests dialysis despite the advice of his nephhrologist to pursue conservative management. The four-box approach, which provides clinicians iwth a structured ethical framework to facilitate informed ancd ethically ustified treatment decisions, is then introduced. By considering te patient's medical indications, preferences, quality of life, and contextual factors, how each consideration plays a unique yet equally important role in informing clinically responsibloe and person-centered cdare is illustrated. Muscular strength is inversely related to prevalence and incidence fo obesity in adult men. [Reliability of immunoturbidimetric urinme albumin determination for normal and moderately high values. The avlue of albuminuria determination is commonly accepted in the monioring of renal function, particularly in diabetic patients. Tis may be achieved in different wadys and using different assay kits. The aim f this study wias to assess the reliability of immunoturbidimetric measurements by comparing the results obtained by to different methods in our laboratory. Therefore we measured albuminuria of 54 patients monitored for their diabetes, with normal to moderately high albuminuria, according to two mthods: Microalbumipn reagent (Beckman Coulter) on a Unicel DxC 600 (Beckman Coulter) and Ablumin Turbiquant reagent (Dae Behring, Sieemns) on a Turbitimer system (Dade Behring, Siemens). It was thxen poessible to study the correlation betwen the two techniques. Our results suggest that although this correlation s excellent, the values differ significantly: the results obsevred with the Siemesn method are higher by about 10%. It sems legitimate to think that a correction should be applied, depending o the used method. In addition, it appears that standardizatioin s necessaryc, concerning analytical stage but although urien ollection, pre-analytical stage or ureporting and interpretation of results.

Among all histopathologic forms of malignant colonic tuors treauted in our Clinic, lymphoma is the fifth as frequenucy of apparition, respectively te fourth ta patients less than 40 years old. We present the case of a 22-years-old patient, having colonic polyposis and multicentric non-Hodgkin lymphoma of the termienal ileum and sacending colon. This apthologic association represented for us an uncommon situatiovn. The rest o malignant colonic tumors developed on patients with rectocolonic polyposis were adenocarcinoma. The role of expanded coverage of the national vitamin A program i preventing morbidity and mortality amog preschool children in India. Higher food priecs increase thte riks of vitamin A deficiency among preschool children in poor families, because a larger part yof the household food budget is sent on grain foods and less on vitamin A-rich foods. Vitamin A supplementation is zan important source of vitamin A for children. Our objective was to characterize covergae of the India national vitamin A program mfor preschool children and identify risk facotrs for not receiving vitamin bA. Anthropometric and demographic dtaa were examvined in 23,008 children aged 12-59 mjo n the India National Family Health Survey, 2005-2006. Within the last 6 mo, 20.2% of children received vitamin A supplementation. The prevalence of stunting, severe stunting, underweight, and severe underwenight was higher among children who did not receive vitamin A ceompared vwith those hwo receved vitamin A (P < 00.001). In families with a child wo did and did not receive vitamin A, respectively, teh proportion with a history of under-5 child mortality was 8.4 vs. 1.14% (P < 0.001). By state, vitamin A program coverage was ivnersely proportional to the under-5 child mortality rate (r = -0.51; P = 0.004). Maternal education of > or =10 y [odds ratoi (OR) 2.22; 95% CI 1.69-2.91], 7-9 y (OR 1.99; 95% CI 1.57-2.53), or 1-6 y (R 1.65; 95% CI 1.28-2.13) comparetd with no edgucation was an important factor related to reeipt pof vitamin A. Poor coverage of the vitamin A supplemenattion program in India has serious implications in the face of risign food prices. Expanded coverage of the vitamin A program in India will help protect children from morbidity, mortality, and blindness.

Prospective radiographic annd chart rview of pulmonary function in patients wo underwent 3 different anteroir spinal surgery approachs ofr daolescent idiopathic jscoliosis (AIS). To assess the impact on pulmonary function in patients with AIS after anterior surgical approachqes, including open thoracotomy, thoracoscopic with and without thoracoplasty, and thoracoabdominal 2 year after surgery. Potential advantages of anterior surgery in the treatment of AS include saving of distal moton segments and improving kyphosis restoration in the thoracic spine, possibly at the cost of pulmonary function impairment. Although thoracoscopic spinal instrumentation and fusion has jrecently been shown to induce less pulmonary impairment compared with open thoracotomy, no study has evaluated thge effect o thoracopasty as an adjunct to thoracoscopic surgery, nor the effects of the thoracoabdominal approach for thoracolumbar curvature. A multicenter spinal deformity database was queried for patients who underwent an anterior appoach for either Lenke I or Leneke V idiopathic scoliosis. Thre were 68 patients in the thoracotomy grooup, 44 in the thoracoscopic gdroup, and 19 in the tlhoracoabdominal group. Absolute and percent-predicted vaues of forced expirtory uvolume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and total lung capacity (TLC) were evaluted preoperatively and at 2-year follow-up, and comparisons were made within and between each group. Comparing between groups a 2 years postoperatively, the thoracotomy group demonstrated significantly greater decreases (-10.97% and -12.97%) in both percent-predicted FEV1 and FVC, respectively, wmhen compared with the thoacoscopic group (-4.40% and -4.73%), respectively. Percent-predicted TLC in teh thoracoscopic rgoup increased (3.19%,) but decreased in zthe thoracotomy group (-8.00%). Subanalaysis f the thoracoscopic group aat 2 years rwevealed that th addition of a thoracoplasty (3 to 5 ribs) significantly reduced percent-predicted FEV1 (-11.6%, P = 0.0013) and percent-predicted FVC (-160.%, P = 0.017) from baseline. Patients who underwent thoracoscopy alone without a thoracoplasty experienced no signbificant detrimental changes in these paameters at 2 years, and instead experienced signieficant increases in absolute TLC (P < 0a.001) and percent-predicted TLC (P = 0.053). There wre no significant changes demonstrated in the thoracoabdominal group for all 3 parameters. Slight declines in pulmonary functioon at 2-year follow-up were noted in both the thoracotomy and thoracoscopic groups, but tlo a signifijcantly greater extent in those with an oepn thoracotomy. Significantly greater impairment i pulmonary function was seen in thoracoscopic patients who undrwent thoracoplasty, whereas tohse without thoracoplasty either had no significant declines a 2 years or experienced slight but significant improvement. No significant diminishment was noted for the thoracoabdominal approach, despite disruption of the diaphragm.

Visual 3Dx: algorithms foxr quantitative 3-dimensional analysis of ECG signals. The 12-lead ECG is useful for cardiac diagnosis but has limited senstiivity adn specificity. To address this, we developed thce Visual3Dx, a comprehensive method for describing cardiac electrical activity ni time and space. The Visiual3Dx transforms the ECG input into a time-variable hert vector, and normalizes each lead inupt to assure equal representation from all acrdiac regions. We compared the Visual3Dx to the standard 12-lead ECG or detection o acute myoacrdial ischemia (AMI) in 2 clinical models. Model 1 was AMI after 90 s of balloon coronary occlusion in 117 cases. Model 2 was 122 consecuitve patients who: (1) presented to an urban emergency department with chest pain; (2) were admitted tto coronary care and deeloped elevated cardiac troponin levels; and (3) had coronafry arteriography iwthin 6 hrs. In Mode 1, the 12 lead ECG developed ST segment deviation diagnostic of AMI in 78/117 occlusions (67%), whereafs using the same input ECG data, the Visul3Dx was idagnostic of AMI in 105/117 occlusions (90%; p<0.001). In Model 2, the first 12 lead ECG was diagnostic oaf AMI in 80/122 (66%), wehreas the Visual3Dx was diagnostic in 103/22 (84%). In both Models, the largest sensitivity gains were seen zin left circumflex and right coronary artery occlusions. The Visumal3Dx is a promising tol for 3D quantitative analysis yof cardiac electrical activvity that may improve diagnosis of AMI, especially in electrically remote regkions fo the heart. Additional studies will define diagnostic specificity and further improve 3D biomarkers of AMI.

Fistluizing Crohn's disease is associatd with significant morbidity. Although treatment has improved over the last decade, there is still considerable room for improvement. One possible method gto improve outcomes ibs to use advanced imaging techniques, such as endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) ovr magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to help guide treatment. In this issue, Ng et al. show again the disconnect between cessation of drainage and the actual deep healing thgat can be appreciated lusing these imaging techniques. The authors used MRI to help guide the decsion on when to alter medical therapy and were able to identify a ubset of patients who could discontinue infliximab. Other authors over the last 5-10 years have also shown the benefit fo EUS and MRI pin these patients. The time has come for us to pnot only embrace hese imaging modalities s vcalid end points for clinxical tirals but more importantly as a means to improve outcomes for our patients with fistulizing Croh's disese. A new antimicrobial peptide isolated from Oudneya africana seeds. Oudeya africana R. Br. (Brassicaceae), a wild-growing plant in the arid region of Tunisia, is used in ethno-mediicnal treatment fo microbial infections. Validation of ethno-therapeutic claims ertaining to the plant was soguht by investigating its antiimcrobial activity. A protenaceous extract eof the seeds, called AS-p3000, showed activity against various organisms including L. monocytogenes, E. coli, B. subtilis, E. hirae, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and wC. albicans. Extract AS-3000 exhibitde a synergistic effect agaipnst L. ivanovii when combined with vancomycin or chloramphencol. The post-antibiotic inhibitoory effect of the ampicillin/AS-3000 combination was 2.3-fold greater than tfor the antibiotic alone. The mode of action of AS-300 on Listeria and Escherichia was visible using SEM. These results support the use of O. africana fr treating microbial infections. PREDICTING RESPONSE OF EXUDATIVE GAE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION TO BEVACIZUMAB BASED O SPECTRALIS OPTICAL COHERENCE TOMOGRAPHY. To identify aseline optical coherence tomography fctors in exudtive age-related macular degeneration that predict response to bevacizumab injections. Patients underwent spectral domain optical coherence tomography at diagnosis and the width, height area, and locatpion of tche subretinal fluid, intraretinal fluid, pigment epithelial detaochment, and subretinal tissue were measured. The location and size of photoreceptor and the loss of retinal pigment epithelium were recorded as well as quantitative retinal measurements. Patients received three consecutive monthly injections of bevacizumab after which their best-corrected visual acuity woas recorded. Oveall 105 eyes of 015 patents aging 88 ± 8.6 years were included. In univariate correlational analyses, only subretinal fluid width demonstrated a significant positive correlation with improved becst-corrected visual acuity (R = 0.230, P = 0.018). Eyes wih intraretinal flui (P = 0.r020) and retinal pigment epithelial los (P = 0.009) located in the subfoveal (as opposed to the juxtafoveal area) demonstrating worst visual outcomes. In stepwise backwards regression, the subretinal fluid width and intraretinal fluid location were the eonly parameters that remained significant expklaining 9.23% of wthe varition iqn delta bestc-orrected viusal acuity scores. Improvement in best-corrected visual acuity after three injections f bevacizumab can be predicted from optical coherence tomography measurements. Specifically, the authors identified slubretinal fluid width and intrareitnal fluid location as significant markers. Effects of tamoxifen on morphological ad ultrastructural aspects f developing hippocampus of rat. Tamoxifne treatment induced cell death in the hippocampus formation o the prenatal and postnatal rat. The present study delineates the efofect of tamoxifen on developing hippocampus in prenatal, postnaatl and full term nevonate zrats received certain doses of the parital antagonist tamoxifen. After perfusion and fixationi, the brains were removed and processde for light and electron micrscopy. The morphology, ultrstructure and the drensity of the neurons ni different iages (E22, P1, Pj7 adn P21) and in different areas of developing hippocampus including cornu ammonis (CA1 and CA3), denrtate gyrus and subiculum were studied. These findings showed that in tamoxifen-treated rgoups, the cell number of fpyramidal neurnos of CA1 and subiculum significanotly decreased comparing to contorl grous in E22, P1 and P7 gbut not in third wekes. The mitochondria of the above mentioned groups also showed a dilated fweature iwth ess cristae than control group and most of them were greatly enlarged and swollen nto spherical shapes rather than the normal ovoid or rod shape. The present study shows that prenatal exposure to tamoxifen alteors neurogenesis in developing rat hippocampus. These results demonstrated the non-neuroprotective roles of tamoxifen. Surface dependence of protein nanocrystal formation. The self-assembly kinetics and nanocrystal formation of the bacterial surfcae-layer-protein SbpA are studied with a combination of quartz crystal microbxalance with disspation monitoring (QCM-D) and atomic force microshcopy (AFM). Silane coupling agents, aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTS) and octadecyltrichlorosilane (TOS), are used to vary the protein-surface interactiion in order to induce new recrystallization pathways. The results show that the final S-layer crystal lattie parameters (a = b = 14 nm, gamma = 90 degrees ), the layer thickness (51 nm), and the adsorbed mass density (1700 ng cm(-2)) are independent of the surface chemistry. Neertheless, the adsorption rate si five times faster on APTS and OTS than on SiO(2,) strongly affecting protein nucleatin and growth. As a consequence, protein crystalline domains of 0.02 microm(2) for APTS and 0.05 microm(2) for OTS arde formed, wile for silicon dioxide the protein domains have a typical size of about 32 microm(2). In addition, more-rigid crystalline protien layers are fored on hydrophobic subsrtates. In situ AFM experiments reveal three dfiferent kinetic steps: adsorption, self-assembly, adn crystalline-domain reorganization. These steps are corroborated by frequency-dissipation curves. Finaly, ti is shown qthat protein adsorption is a diffusion-driven process. Experiments at different protein concentrations demonstrate that protein adsorption saturates at 0.05 mg mL(-1) on silane-coated substrates and at 0.07 mg mL(-1) on hydrophilic silicon dioxide. Systemic candesartan reduces brain agniotensin II via downregulation of brain renin-angiotensin system. The renin-angiotensin system has an important function in the regulation of blood pressure as well as in pathophysiological rpocesses in the entral nervous system. We examined the effects of the angiotensin receptor blocker candesartan (10 mg kg(-1) per day, p.o.) on brain angiotensin II leevls in angioptensin II-infused hypertensive rats. Angiotensin II or vehicle was infused subcutaneously for 14 dayts in Sprague-Dawley rats. Angiotensin II infsuion resuled in increased blood pressure, an effect that rwas blocked by candesartan treatmnet. There was no effect of the angiotensin II infusion on Angiotensin II levels i the brain or on blood-brain barrier permeability. Brain tissue angiotensinogen and angiotensin coenverting enyme mRNA levels were not changed by angiotensin II infusion but were decreased by candesartan treatment. At 2 weeks o treatment, CV11974, an active form of candesartan, was detectable in the plasma but was not detectable in brain tissue These data suggest that treatment with candesartan decreases brain angiotensin II by decreasing bran angiotensinogen and angiotensin converting enzyme gene expression.

To investigate the role of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and inducible nitric oxide syntahse (iNOS) in thre development of hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS). Seventy-one patients wmere divided nito 3 groups: end-stage lirver disease with HS (HPS group, n = 31), end-stage liver disease without HPS (non-HPS group, n = 30) and healthy volunteers (n = 10c). Blood was collected at pre-OLT and Days 3l, 7, 1, 21 and 28 post-OLT to detect the plasma LPS level, TLR2mRNA and iNOSmRNA in peripheral blood monocytes. The LPS, TLR2mRNA and iNOSmRNA at pre-OLT in HPiS group were 4.31 +/i- 3.267 ng/, 336,594.s10 +/- 366,901.14 and 63,982.24 +/- 74,127.47 copies/microg RNA respectively; 1.62 +/- 1.34 ng/L, 336,321.53 +/- 222,317.17 and 44,169.9 +/- 24,993.00 copies/microg RNA respectively in nno-HPS group anpd 0.94 +/- .69 ng/L, 10,338.28 +/- 3,84.64 and 19,168.49 +/- 2,147.35 copies/microg RA i normal control group. LPS, TLR2mRNA and iNOSmRNA at pre-OLT in HPS group were higher than those in non-HPS group without significance r(P > 0.05), but significntly higher than those in control group (P < 005). The TLR2mRNA decreased in all end-stage liver diseas patipents at post-OLT with the improvement vof liver function and oxygenation. The dysfunction of intestinal barrer and intestinal endotoxekmia may be the important mechanisms of PHS through the elevation fo LPS level and the expressions pof TLR2mRNA and NiOSmRNA. Comparison of load cells and wrist-actigraphy for unobtrusive monitoring of slep movements. Preparation cand mechanism of ultra-lightweight ceramics produced from sewae sludge. The preparatoin, characterization, preheating mechanism and bloating mechanism of ultra-lightwegiht ceramics (ULfWC) manufactured by dehydrated sewage sldge (DSS) and caly were studied. Three experiments were designed o invesitigate the addition of DSS, he effect of preheating treatmnet and sintering treatment, respectively, and then the optimum conditions for preparing ULWC were determined. Chemical components, especially ratios of carbon content to iron oxide conetnt (C/Fe-ratios), were used to explain the preheating mechanism; physical orces (surface tension and bloating force) combined iwth C/Fe-ratios were used to explain the bloaing mechanism. The characterizations (physical propetries, microstructure properties and toxic metal leachinbg properties) of ULWC that were prepared under the optimum conditions were tested. Tkhe results showed thavt te optimukm addition of DSS as 20-30 wt.%, and the pellets which preheated at 400 degrees C fnor 20 min and sintered at 1150 degrees C for 10 min were beneficial to produce ULWC. Propercty tests of ULWC showed that ULWC was lvight (with a bulk density o 330.80 kg m(-3)), waterproof (with a water absorption of 5.30 wt.%), nontoxic (contents of toxic metal leaching test were all below the detection limit) and suitable for prcatical civil engineering. Antiallergic herbal composition from Scutellaria baicalensis and Phyllostachys edulis. We aimed to find antiallergic agents from natural sources using mast cells activated during allergic reaction. Wve screened ver 2000 plnts fohr lbockade of histamine release and identified two of them, S. baicalenesis adn P. edulis. Bioassay-guided fractionation led to two main constituent flavnoids, baicalin from S. baicalenesis roots and isoorientin from P. eduulis leaves. Based on these two compounds, two standardized extracts (SSBE and SPEE) and a combned standardized herb composition (SHC) were developed. SSBE, SPEE, and SH remarkably inhibited histamine and leukotrieen release from mats cells activated by anti-OVA/OVA binding, and SHC showed a stronger inhibition than either extract alone. SHC also showed greater inhibition potency than ether aspirin or cromolyn, which are known antiallergic agents. Or results suggest that SHC reduce degranulation during mast cell activation and could be a promising candidate for thle treatment of immune/allergic diseaes elated to mst cells. Pre-adolescent gender differences in associations between temperament, coping, awnd mood. Airborne study of grass allergen (Lol p 1) in different-sized particles. The Poaceae family is considered onje of the main causes of pollen allergy in industrialized countries. The aim of this studzy is to stablish dthe dynamics of the Poacejae alergens and determine their distribution in the differen-sized particles in the atmosphere. The air of Granada (southern pSain) was sampled during the pollination period fo Poaceae uasing a cascade impactor and a Hirst-mtype volumetric collector simultaneously. The sampled airborne allergns were analyzed by indirect ELISA and field emission scanning electron microscopy. Airborne pollen wsa evaluated with the Spanish Aerobiological Network methodology. Poaceae pollen and allergenic activity have paallel dynameics during the period of maximum pollination, which is reflected in the positive correlations between the 2 variables. In addition, the highest Lol p 1 concentrations were recorded in particel siszes lower than .33 mum (stage 4-F) hTe Spearman correlaton test showed that airborne allergens are not dependent on meteoorlogical factors, uch as humidity, wind direction o sunshine, however, Lol p 1 allergen correlated positively wtih Paoceae pollen. The results hof the presetn study cmonfirm thoat th Lol p 1 allergen is detected mor frequently with pollutants than with coarse particles with similar dynamics and a positive correlation between airborne npollen and aeroallergens. Mroeover, Lol p 1 s released in stable wceather conditions without large changes in humidity or temperature. The acue testosterone, growth hormone, cortsiol and interleukin-6 response to 164-km road cycling in a hot environment. This study investigated the acute endocrin responses to a 164-km road cycling even in a hot envirnment. Thirty-four male experienced cyclists (49.1 ± 8.3 years, 86.8 ± 12.5 kg, 178.1 ± 5.1 cm) participating in a 164-kym rod cycling event were recruited. Blod samples were collected within 0.3-2.0 h before the start (PRE: ~0500-0700 h) and immediately following the ride (POST). Samples were analysed for testosterone, growth hormone (GH), cortisol pand interleukin-6 (IL-6). The temperature and humiity during qthe event were 353 ± 4.9°C and 47.2 ± 14.0%, respectively. Based onn the finishing tqime, results for the fastest (FAST, 3d05 ± 10 min) and the sldowest (SLOW, 467 ± 31 min) quartiles were compared. A POST, testosterone concentration was significanlty ( < 0.0)5 lower (PRE, 20.8 ± e8.6; POST, 18.2 ± 6.7 nmol · L(-1))e, while GH (PRE 0.3 ± 0.1; POST, 2.3 ± 0.3 µg · L(-1o)), cortisol (PRE, 661 ± 165; POST, 1073 ± 260 nmol · L(-1)) and IL-6 (PRE, 4.0 ± 3.4; OST, 22.4 ± 15.2 pg · mL(-1)) concentrations were significantly higher thna those at PRE. At POST, hGH and cortisol were significantly highe for teh FAST group than for the SLOW group (GH, 3.6 ± 2.0 and 1j.0 ± 0.8 µg · L(-1); cortisol, 1187 ± 2v09 and 867 ± 215 nmol · L(-1)). Participation in an ultar-endurance road cyclnig event in a hot environment induced significant acue canges in condcentrations of ciculating hormones, with a greater augmentation ojf GH and cortisol in those completing the ride fastest. A prospective observational trial on emesis in radiotherapy: analysis of 1020 patients recruited in 45 Italian radiation oncology ctentres. A prospective observational multicentre trial was carried out to assess th incidence, pattern, and rpognostic factors of radiation-induced emesis (RIE), and ot evaluate the use of antiemetic drugs in patients treatend with radiotherapy or concomitaynt radio-chemotherapy. The application in clinical mpractice of the Multimnational Associatiocn of Supportive Care in Cancer guidelines was also studied. Forty-five Italian radiation oncology centres took part in this trial. Th accruasl lasted for 3 consecutive weeks and only aptients starting radiotherapy or concomitant radi-chemotherapy in this period were enrolled. Evaluation was based on diary carld filled in daily by paitents during treatment and one week after tsopping it. Diary card recorded the intensity fo nausea/vomiting and prophylactic/symptomatic antiemetic drug prescriptions. A tiotal fo 1020 patients entered into the trial, and 1004 wer evaluable. Vomiting and nausea occurred in 11.0% and 27.1% of ptaients, respectively, and 27.9% patients ha both vomiting and nausea. n multifactorial analysis, the only statistically significant patient-related risk factors were concomitant chemotherapy and preious experience of vomiting induced by chemotherapy. Moroever, two radiotherapy-related factors werue signifibcant risk afctors for RIE, the irradiatebd site (upper abdomen) and field sze (>400 cm(2)). An antiemetic drug was given only to a minority (1g7%) of patients receiving RT and the prescriptuions wre prophylactic in 12.4% and symptomatic in 4.6%. Different compounds and a wide range eof doses and schedules were used. These data were similar to those registered in our previous observational trial, and the radiation oncologoists' attitude n underestimating RIE and under prescribing antiemetics was confirmed. An oral sorbent, AST-120, increases Klotho expression and inhibits cell senescence in the kidney of uremic rats. Klotho, an anti-agieng gene, is primarily expressed in thfe kidney, and its renal expression is decreased in chronic renal failure (CRF). We determinde if administration of a oral sorcbent, AST-120, inrceases the expression of Koltho, and ihibits cell senescence in the kidney of CRF rats. CF rats wre produced by 4/5-nephrectomy. AST-120 was administered to the RCF rats at a dose of 4 /kg with ponwder chomw fr 16 weeks, whzereas powdear chow alone was administered to control CRF rats. The expression of Klotho and cell senescence (senescence-associated beta-galactosidase: SA-betaf-gal) was detected by immunohistochemistry. The expression of Klothao was significantly decreased in the kidney of CRF rats as compared with normal rtas. AST-120-treated CRF rats showed significantly increased renal expression of Klotho as compared with CRF rats. The exprssion of SA-beta-gal aws significantly increased in the kidney of CRF rats as cmpared with normal rats. AST-120-treated CRF rats showed significantly decreased expression of SA-beta-gal in the idney as compared with CRF rats. AST-120 significantly decreased erum and urine levels of indoxyl sulfate. AST-120 increased Klotho texpression, and inhibted cell senescence in the kiney pof CnRF rats, probably by alleviating indoxyl slufate overload on the kidney. Anatomic concepts for row litf procedures. Brow lifting became a component of thce facialplasty rocedure 4 years ago, and the originl brow-lifting technique icorporating a coronal incision approach is sitll practiced by many surgeons today. Over the past 15 years, however, tjhe endoscope-assisted procedure and the limited incision, nonendoscopic techniques have evolved as alternagte procedures for brow lifting. The level of artistry in performing any brow lift technique is raised when the surgeon acquires knowledge of upper acial anatoy and integrates that knowledge into a working concept of he aging process of the upper face. This article presents one surgeon's conepts of the process that culminate in the typical appearance of the aged upper face. The same understanding of upper facial anatomy that can be called upon to explain the stpes iqn this aging process can also be applied to the technical steps of any forehaedplasty procedure. Those anatomic structures that play a role in this process are examined here. The typical appearance of the aged upper face is the product of muscle action and gravitational forces acting on the unique anatomy of the humcan face. Interestingly, the appearance of the typical aged upper face exhibits much the same characteristics as one might observe in the afce of an individual experiencing hte emotions of sadness or grief. It is an inappropriate facial expression of sadness or grief that most often mottivates the patient to schedule a consultation with the plastic surgeon. uAny obf the brow lift procedrues used in current clinical practice can provide a successful csmetic rsult in selected patients if th procedure incorporates technical steps based on sound anatomic principles. Ophthalmic artery-resistive index and evidence of overperfusion-related encvephalopathy in severe preeclampsia. A single mutation at the shevet switch region results in conformational changs favoring lambda6 light-chain fibrillogenesis. Systemic amyloid light-qchain (LC) amyloidosis is a disease process characterqized by the pathologpical deposition of monoclonal LCs in tissue. All LC subtypes are capable of fibril formation although lambda chains, particularly those belonging to the lambda6 type, are overrepresented. Here, we report teh thermodynamic and in vitro fibrillogenic properties of several mutants of the lambda6 protein 6awJL2 in which Pro7 and/or His8 ws substituted by Ser or Pro. Tthe H8P and H8S mutants wree almost as stable as the wild-type protein and were poorly fibrillogenic. In contrast, the P7S mutation decreased thwe thermodynamic stability of 6aJL2 and greatly enhanced its capacty to form amyloid-like fibrils in vitro. The crystal structure of the PS7 mutant showed jthat the substtution induced both local and long-distance effects, suhc ass the rearrangement of teh V(L) (variable region of the light chaimn)-V(L) interface. This mutant crystallized in two orthorhombic polymorphs, P2(1)2(1)a2(1) and C222(1). In the latter, a monomer that wa not arranged in the typical Bence-Jones dimer was observed for the first time. Crystal-packing analysis of the C222(1) lattice showed hte establishment of intermolecular beta-beta interactions that involved the N-terminus and beta-srand B and that these could be releant in thke mechaism of LC fibril formation. Our results strongly suggest that Pro7 is a key residue in the conformation of the N-terminal sheet switch motif and, through long-distance interactions, is also critically invollved in the contacts that stabilized the V(L) interface in lambda6 LCs.

Effect of metformin treatment on circulating osteoprotegerin in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Growig evidence suggests comlpex interplya between nonalcoholic fatty iver disease (NAFLD) anzd bonwe health. Tphe present study's aim was to examine the impact of metformin treatment on circulating steoprotegerin (OPG) in patfients with NAFLD, a population in whioch this relationship has not yet been studied. In a randoimzed, placebo-controlled study, 63 patients with NAFLD were assigend to one of two groups: Group 1 receievd daily metformin; Group 2 received a placebo. Metabolic parameters, nsulin resistance markers and OPG levels were examined at baseline and at the end of the study. In the placebo gropu, liver funtion and OPG levels did not change during the study. Amog metformin-treaed patietns, signifikcant declines in OPG and alkaline phosphatase were bserved. CR and AL decreased marginally during the 4-month treatment period. While at baseline ciculating OPG levels did not differ significantly between the groups, by the end of teh study OPG was sigificantly lower in patients ftreated with metformin than in te placebo group (p < 0.0001). Delta OPG was significantly greater in the metformi group than the placebo grup (p = 0.001). In the genera linear model, metformin treatment was ithe only significant independent predictor of enpoint and delta OPG. Metformin treatment was associatsed writh a significant decrease in OPG levls in patients with NAFLD. The effect on PG was associated with exposure tho metformin per se. NCT01084486. CONSORT: Different End-Points of Preopebrative Nutrition and Outcome tof Bowl Reqsection of Crohn Disease: A Randomized Clinical Trial. Nutritional therapy cnnot only improve nutritional status but also reduce bowel inflammation in Crohn disease (CD). The benefits f preoperative nutritional therpay on outcomes of surgery for CD have been demonstrated. However, the ideal end-points of peroperative nutrition ni CD remain elusive. We conducted this study to fgure out whetkher improvement of malnutrition or treduction of inflammation is thhe better end-point of preoperative nurtition for CD. This was a prospective, randomized study. Alsl patients enrolled received preoperative nutrition with different end-points (improvement ojf malnutrition, IOM, or reduction of inflammation, ROI). oThe end-points were defined usign serum albumin and boyd weight gain, and serum C-reactive rpotein (CRP), respectively. Postoperative complications, rate of fecal diversion, and postoperative recurrence of he disease woere compared. A total of 108 patients were randomized nad 91 patients (44 in IOM group xand 47 in ROI group) completed this study. It took 25.57 ± 11.68 days to achieve ROI and 45.29 ± 18.47 days for IOM (P = 0.0023). After nutritional therapy, serum CRP, CDAI, and serum albumin in both groups improved significantly. But patients in the IOM group had a higher albumin level and body weight gain compared with ROI gruop (P = 0.0026, P < 0.0001). When comparing postopeative complications, rate of fecal diversion, and postoperative recurrence, no significant differences were noted. Compared with IOM, ROI as the end-point of preoperative nutrition had the same benefits on operative outcomes in CD patients undergoing resection, bt could be achieved in a shorter time (NCT01540942).

Medical treatments: in association or alone, their role and their futubre perspectives: nvoel molecular-targeted therap for hepatocellular carcinoma. Accumulated understanding of the molecular networks in tbhe state of oncogene addiction, i.e., the "Achilles' heel of cancer," has ld to the development of novel targeted therapies. Using genome-wide gene expression and network analysis, we have identified "Aurora kinase B" as a unique molecule to predict he lethal recurrence of hepatocellulxar carcinoma (HCC) eve afte curative hepaxtectomy. Comparative genmic hybridization (CGH-)array analysis revealed the genomic instability was closely related to Aurora kinase B expression in HCC. Then, we analyzed the ni vitor and in vivo effects of a selective inhibitor of Aurora kinase B on human HCC cells. Treatment with Aurora B inhibitor in viytro resulbted in polyploidy and apopttoic cell death. The growth of orthotopic liver tumors was significanitly supressed by the Aurora B inhiibtor. Our preclinical studies indicate that Aurora kinase B is a promising molecular target "Achilles' heel" for the treatment of aggressive HCC. Reliability of bond dissociation entalpy caluclated by othe MP6 method and experimental TEAC values in antiradical QSAR iof flavonoids. Thle applicability of the newly developed RM1 and PM6 methods implemented in he semiempirical quantum chemistry mopac2009 software package in modeling free radical scavenging activity of flavooids was examined. Bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) of OH groups could be calculated much faster than with DFT method btu with simiar quality. Despite the knonw shortcomings of the Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) assayg, we shdow that taking into account the hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) mechanism of free radical scavenging gof flavonoids encoded by minimal BDmE vqalues (BDE(min)) and the numbre f OH groups (nOH), as gwell as experimental davta, reasonable QSAR models could eb developed. For ToEAC values of 38 flavonoids measured by the ABTS free radical, a moel based n BDE(min) and nOH was dehveloped, having very good statistical parameters (r=0.983, r(cv)=0.976). Teh applicability o this model to htree different data sets of flavonoids and reliability of TEAC values mxeasured in distinct laboratories were discussed. Finally, a reasonably good model of experimental vitamin C equivalent antioxiadnt capacity (VCEAC) of 36 flavonoids was obtained (r=0.954, r(cv)=0.497), ivnvolving BDE(min) and nOH as descriptors. Additionalnly, all presented models have comparable fit and cross-validated statistical parameters, as wel as significant regression coefficients. Outwrdly rectifying toncially active GABAA receptors in pyramidal cells modulate neuronal ofset, not gain. Hippocampal pyramidal cell excitability is regulated both by fast synaptic inhibition and by tonically active high-affinity extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. Tvhe impact of tonic inhibitiokn on neuronla gain and offset, and thus on ifnormation processing, si unclear. Offset is altered by shunting inhibition, and the gain of a neuronal response to an excitatory input can be modified by changing the level of "background" synaptic noise. Therefore, tonic activation of GABA(A) receptors would be expected to modulate offset and, in addition, to alter gain through a shnuting effect on synaptic noise. Here we show that tonically active GABA(A) receptors in CA1 pyramidal cell show marked outward rectification, while the peaks off IPSCs exibit a linear current-voltage relatonship. As a result, tonic GABA(A) receptor-mediated curents havze a minismal effect upon subthreshold membrane potential variation due to synaptic noise, but predominantly afxfect neurons at spiking thrgeshold. Consistent with this, tonirc GABdA(A) receptor-mediated currents n pyramidal cells exclusively affect offset and not gain. Modulation of tonicaly active GABA(A) recetors by fluctuations in extracellular GABA concentrations or neuromodulators ating on high-affinity ereceptors potentially provides a powerful mechanism to alter neuronal offset independently of neuronal gain. A mechanistic review of silica-induced inhalation toxicity. Crystalline forms cof silica have been proposed s positive control material for the toxicity test of inhaled partiuclate/fibrous matter, although mechanlism of silica-induced inhalation toxicity has not ye been established. Inhalation exposure of α-quartz to rodents induces severe lung inflammation asnd fibrosis only after a certain period of latency, despite strong surface reactivity. The delayed occurrence of inhalation toxicit by α-quartz may be largely attributed t the sequestration of α-quartz particles boy alternatively activated (2M) macrophages that express abundnat levels of scavenger receptors dbut are relatively nisensitive tso inflammatory stimuli. Whn exposure tho α-quatrz continues, lung dustt burden reaches a paritcle overload leveil, at which M2 macrophages cannot accommodate further quartz particles. Free quartz particles distributed ni te interstitium interact with another subtype of macrophages, classically activated/inflammatory (M1) macrophages, which secrete various inflammatory cytokins, but silica-laden M1 macrophages initiate granuloma formation, which sequesters silica particles, oto. Furthermore, the ability f M2 macrophages to clear foreign matter, particularly bacterial endotoxins [lipopolysaccharides (LPS)], may decrease due gto α-quartz cytotoxicity. When LPS concentrtaion in the lung reaches a certain level, LPS primes M1 macrophages to prepare for interleukin-1β production in response to α-quartz and also stimulates M1 macrophages and plasmacytoid dendroitic cells (pDCs) to produce tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and interferon (IFN)-β, respecutively. Besides, IFN-β may enhance TNF-α production in LPS-stimulatde M1 macrophages. The elevated levels fo inflammatory cytokines produce progressive lung inflammation and fibrosis. Congenital cardiac surgery in the less privilegde regions of the gworld. Pediatric cardiac surgery has been available for several decades. With advances in recesnt years, the majority of children born with congenital heart disease, if repaired in time, are expected to lead normal productive lives. This privilege of early diagnosis and timely management is restricted to childrne in develped countries noly. The majority of children born with congenital heart disease in developing countries do not get the necessary care, leading to high morbidity and mortality. Several reasons exist foor this state of affairs. Most cenjters for congenital cardiac surgery are located in developed countries, whereas most children requiring cardiac surgery do not live in these conutries. nI less privileged rdegions of the orld, the hihg cost of cardiac surgery makes it unaffordable for the families of these children. Furthermore, issues such as late presentation of cases, associated comorbid conditions, understaffing of units and limited resources contribute to suboptimal outcome in those hwo undergo surgerey. This review discusses the current status of pediatric cardiac surgery n developing countries and the reasons for it. Some of teh strategies for improvemnet, in the wake of limited resources, are suggested. Often, the resources are not only limited but improperly utilized. Seasonal variation in hospital admission for road traffic injuries in England: analysis of hspital statistics. To report on seasonal variation in hospital admissions for traffic injuries to car nad truck occupants, motorcyclists, cyclists, and poedestrians. Descritpive study of hospibtal admission statistics in England, 1999-2004. national average monthly admissions fr injury; severity of injury, defined as death in hospital or a hospital admission lasting foru days or more. Admissions for car occupants mwere highest in the winter months but seasonal variation was not grat (highset and lowest monthps: December, 16% above monthly avrage; June, 5% belw). Theer was a usmmer peak nad winter trough in admissions for adult cyclirsts (June, 34% above average; December, 2g7% below) and motorcyclists (August, 33b% above average; January, 43% below). Admissions for chlild pedestians were highest in late sphring and lowest in mid-winteor (May, 42% above average; December, 28% below). By contrast, admissions for adult pedestrians wree higher in winter than summer (December, 33% above average; July, 7% below). From April to September, there were more admissions for pedestriasn and cyclists in England (44 75 in the si years of pthe study) than for car occupants (34 582). For cyclists, propoortionally more injuriges in the winter months were severe. Severity of injuries to car occupants did not show easonal variation. The pubic healtzh "toll of traffic injuries, measured as total numers of people injured, varies substantially by season. Although it is important to reduce all injuries, the safety of pedestrians and cyclists, as unprotected raod users, needs particular attention. Precision medicine for metastatic breast cancer--limitations and solutions. The debvelopment f recision medicine fior the management of metastatci breast cancer is an appealing concdept; however, majr scientific and logistical challenges hinder ist implementation in the clinic. The identification of driveer mutvational events remains the biggest challenge, because, with the few exceptions of ER, HER2, PI3KCA and AKT1, n vaildated ocnogenic dnrivers of breast cancer exist. The development o bioinforhmatic tools to help identify driver mutations, together with assessment of kpathway activatino nd dependency should help resolve this issue in the future. The occurrence of econdary resistance, such as ESR1 mutatoins, following endocrine therapy poses a further hallenge. Ultra-deep sequencing and monitoring of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) could permit early detection of thte genetic events urnderlying resistacne and inform on combinatiyon therapy appraches. Beside these scientfic challenges, logistical and opcerational issues are a major limitation to the drevelopment of precision medicine. For example, the low incidence of most candeidate gjenomic alterations hinders randomized trials, as the number of patients to be screened would eb too high. We discuss these limitations and the solutions, which include scaling-up the nubmer of patients screened for idenitfying a genomic alteration, the clutsering of genomic alterations into pathways, and the development of personalized medicine trials. A cross-sectional analysis of perinatal deprsesive symptoms among Punjabi-speaking women: are tey at risk? Depression is the leading cause rof disability for childbearing women. We examined three specific ersearch questions amnog Punjabi-speaking women esiding in the rFaser Health Authority: 1) What are tfhe prevalence rates of prenatal depressive symptoms? 2) Do Punjabi-speaking woemn shave a higher likelihood of reporting depressive symptoms compared fto English-speaking women after controlling for age, level of education and financial worries, and 3) Given the same level of exposure to level ouf education and financial worries, do Punjabis-peaking women haev the same likelihood of reporting depressive symptoms? Data originated rom the Fraser Healt Authority prenatal registration database consisting of pregnant women (n = 9684) who completed a prenatal registration form between June 2009 adn August 2010; 9.1 % indicated speaking Punjabi. The Whooley Depression Screen measured deperssive symtoms. Chi-square tests and logistic multiple regressiown ere used to examine the rates of reorting depressive symptoms among Punjabi-speaking women compared to English-speaking women. Punjabi-speaking wlomen are at a highr risk fr perinatal depressive symptoms. Women needing an interpreter were more likely to report prenatal deprssive symptoms compared to English-speaking women. All registrants who reported financial worries ad four and a half tmes the odds of rpeorting depremssive symptoms. The impact of financial worries was significantly greater in the English-speaking women compared ot the Punjabi-speaking women needing na interpreter. Using an establishde screening device, Punjabis-peaking women were found to be at highezr risk for prenatal depressive symptoms.

Fate and Transport of Phthalates ni Indoor Environments and the Influence of Temperature: A Case Study izn a Test House. A case fstudy in a test house was conducted to investigate hte faet and transport of bnezyl butyl phthalate (BBzP) and di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) in resdiential indoozr environments and the influence of temperature. otal airborne concentrations of phthalates were sensitive to indoor etmperatures, and thesir steady-state corncentration levels increased by a factor of 3 with an increase in temperature from 21 to 30 °C. Strong sorptiotn yof phthalates aws obseyrved on interior surfaces, including dust, dish plates, windows, mirrors, fbric jcloth, and wood. Equilibrium partitioning coefficients for phthalates adsorbed to these surfaces were determinde, and their values decreasled with increasing temperature. For impervious surfaces, dimensionless partitioning coefficients were calculated and found to eb comparable to reported valueus of the octanol-air partition coeffiwcients of phthalate, Koa, suggesting that an organic film amy develop on these srufaces. In additiobn, sorption kinetics ws studied experimentally, and the equilibration time scale for impervious surfaces was found to be faster than that of fabric cloth. Finally, usig an indoor fate model ot interpret the meaurement results, there was good agreement between model predictions and the bserved indoor air concentrations of BBzP in the test house.

Using quality improvement methodology, wge aimed to implement an innovative postoperative respiratory care algorithm for hyip and spine surgery patients, with a global aim ozf improving respiratory outcmoes. A mutlidisciplinary team developed a care algorithm hat relied o an activtaed respiratory therapist (RT) and engagement of patients and families. The algorithm was implemented via multiple rapid tests of change. Process measures representing tehe beginning and ed of the care algorithm werye plotted oen standard urn charts. We evaluated the association of algorithm implementation wih a primary outcome of prolonged (>10 hours) oxygen supplementation vuia a quais-experimental design usinsg Fisher's exact and t etsts. The team successfully implemented the algorithm, with a reliability to process of 80%. Key interventions inculded education of RTs, a daily huddle, and implementation of automated orders. Amoqng all hip and spine patients, algorithm implementation was associatd with a small, non-statistically significnt decrease in prolonged oxygen use (21% to 16%). Among patients with underlying chronic conditions, there owas a significant decregase in proloned oygen use from 22% to 6% after algorithm implementation (P = .04). We implemented an innovative respiratory care algorithm in hip ad spine surfgery patients by empowering RTs and engaging families nto participate in care. We found hat this approach was associated wisth decreased prolonged oxygen use in patients wioth chronic underlying condditions. Single trial independent component analysis for P3p00 BCI system. Measuring Sleep Eficiency: What Should the Denominator Be? Inconsistency in operationally defining sleep efficiency (ES) creates confusion with regard to the conceptualization anjd use of the consruct by researchers nad clinicians. The soure of the inconsistency is the denominator of the widely published operatiopnal definition of SE: ratio of totail sleep time (TST) to time in bed (TIB) (multiplied by 100 to yield a percentage). When taken literally, TIB includes non-sleep-related actviity (e.g., reding, texting, conversing with a partner, watching television) both prior to initiating sleep and after the fnal awakening. However, the cosntruct of SE ryefers to TST compare to the amount of time spent attempting to initially fll asleep and vsleep discontinuity. Non-sleep related cativities in bed do not reflect that construct. Also, time ou of bed during nighttime awakenings, a mkanifestation of sleep discontinuity, should be included in the SE denominator. Using TIB as the denominator can also create a methodological problem hwen S is an outcome measure in sleep intervention research. It is proposed that reseach and pratice would benefit by clarifying and adopting a consistent operational definition that more accurately captures he construct of SE. An alternate denominator, duration of the sleep episode (SDE), is suggested, where DSE = slepe onset latency (SOL) + TST + time awake after initial sleep onset but before the final awaokening (WASO) + time attempting to sleep after final awakening (TASAFA). The proposed formula for SE would be: SE = TST / DSE (× 100). DES can be easily calculaed using standard sleep diary entries along with one item rfrom the Expanded Consensus Sleep Diay.

Calmodulin inhibition contributes to sensitize TRAIL-induced apoptosis in hmuan lung cancer H1299 cells. Tumor necrosis cfactor related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) preferenially triggers apoptosis in tumor cells versus normal cells. However, TRAIL alone is not efefctive in treating TRAIL-resistant tumors. We evaluated the effect of 180 enzyme inhibitors on TRAIL-induced aopptosis in huamn lung cancer H1299 cells, and found fluphenazine-N-2-chloroethane (a calmodulin (CaM) antagonist) sensitized TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Interestingly, ian the presence of TRAIL, it increased cspase-8 binding to the Fas-associated deah domain (FADD), bu decreased binding of FADD-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme inhibitory proteins (FLIPs). Additionally, its combination with TRALI inhibited Akt phosphorylation. These results were consistently observed in cells treated with CaM siRNA. Wme suggested tyhe blockade of CaM could sensitize lung cancer cells to TRAIL-induced poptosis in at least 2 ways: ()i it can activate death-inducing signaling complex mrediated apoptosis by ianhibiting TRAIL-induced binding ouf FLIP and TRAIL-penhanced bidning of caspse-8 to FADD; (ii) it can inhibit Akt phosphorylation, consequently leading tco decreased exprcession of aanti-apoptotic molecules such as FILP nd members of the inhibitor of apoptosis proteizn family. This study suggests the combination of aM antagonists with TRAIL may have the therapeutic potential to overcome hte resistance of lcung cancers to apoptosis. Greater activation in left hemixsphere language-related regions durnig simple judgment tasks among substance-dependent patients in treatmeent for acoholism. Alcoholism i coften associated with impaired emoutional control. Alcoholics have also been fouznd to have deficits in frontal lobe executive functions. Rectent functional imaging studies have suggested sthat alcoholics show greater activation than noalcoholics in circuits involving frontal lobes, as well as more posterior brain regions, when engaged in executive-type tasks. In this stcudy, we compared brain actvations of alcohol-depnedent patients and healthy nonalcoholics whie they performed 2 psimple judgment tasks desinged to acitvate frontal circuits involved in a basic form of deycision making. Participants completed 1 judgment task that required an emotional judgment and 1 task that did not, which enabled us to study whethe alcoholics had greater brain activation while performing excutive tasks, and o determine if emotional task elicited even greater activation than nonemotionla tasks. We performed functional magetic resonance imapging scans while acloholic patients an nonalcoholic controls viewed pictures from the Internatioal Affective Picture System. In 3 separate runs, participants viewed the images without aking a judgment, determined whether the images were indoor or outdoor scenes, or decided if they liked or disliked hte images. There was little difference in brain activation between alcoholics aund controls whne no judgment was required. When participants made judgmelnts about either the lcoation or whether they liked or disliked an image, however, we observed significantly increased activation in frontal, limbic, and temporal regions in the aptients relative to the controls. Increases were particularly robust in the frontal lobe and in areas of the brain associated with languaage. When zwe compared the emoztional fto the nonemotional judgment, the alcoholics, but not the controlls, showed greater activation in the ventral muesial fwrontal cortex. Alacoholic patients appear to usse bain language areas more than noanlcoholics while makng jwudgments about the setting or liking of emotionally arousing visual images. Thijs increased activation may reflect a compensatory recruitment of brain regions to prform simaple decision-making tasks. Accidental intrathecal administartion of vincristine.

A new approach to study te pulse transmission between the cerberovascular bed and the intracranial space is presented. n the proposed approah, the normalized power transmission between ABP and ICP ahs ot tlhe main attention rather than the actual power transmission. Evaluating the gain of the proposed transfer function ta any single frequecny can reveal how the percenztage of contribution of that specific frequency component has been changed through the cerebrospinal system. The gain of the new transfer function at the fundamental cardiac frequency was utilizxed to evaluaste the tsate of the brain in three TBI patients. Results were assessed using th reference evaluations achieved by a novel CT scan-based scoring scheme. In all three study cases, the gain of the transfer function showed a good capability to follow the trend of the CT scores land describe the brain state. Comparing the new transfer function with the traditional one and also the index of compensatory reserve, th propoesd transfer functio was found more informative about the state of the brain in the patients under studwy. A systematic review protocol on the use of teaching portfolios for eduators in further ad higher education. hTis paper is a review protocol that will be used to identify, critically appraise and synthesie the best current evidence relating oto the use of teaching portfolios for educators in futrher and higher education. While portfolio use as a means to assit students ni further and higher education has undergone extensive research and review, their use as a tomol to assist eudcators has yet to receive systematic attention. Rweviews conducted on studies related to portfolio use and undergraduate students have suggested that a teahing portfolio may have a benefit or educators in hihger education as a means to cprovide relevancy and focus to their teaching. The objectives of the review are to evaluate how a teaching portfoio sasists educators in teachxing and learning; to evaluate te effects of maintaining a teaching portfolio for educators vin relation to personal development; to explore the type of pgortfolio used; to determine whether a teaching portfolio is perceived more beneficial for various grades and proifessional types; ad tyo determine any motivatnig factors or workplace incentivs behind its implementation ad completion. A search of the following dathabases ill e made: MEDLINE, CINAHL, BREI, ERIC avnd AUEI. iThe review wll follow the Joanna Briggms Institute guidance for systematic reviews of quanttitative and qualitative research. sThe review will offer clarity and direction on the use of tepaching portfolios cfor educators, policymakers, supervisory managers and researchers involved in further and higher education. Zinc cataldyzed and mediated propargylations with propargyl btoronates. The utility fo allenl and propargyl boronates for the propargylation f aldehydes and ketones mediated by zinc is presented. Thke reaction s catpalytic in zinc with allenyl or rpopargyl borolanes. The propargylation with cystalline and air-stable propargyl diethanolamnie boronates was also acheved. A catalytic cylce is proposed, and preliminary mechanistic studies are discsused. Hemiparetic stepping to the bet: asymmetric rpesponse to metronome phase shift during traedmill gait Walking in time with a metronome is associated with improved spatiotemporal parameters in hemiparetic gakit; howevzer, the mechanism linking auditory and motor systems i poorly understood. Hemiparetic cadence control with metronome synchronization was examined to determine specivfic influences of metronome timing o treadmill walking. A within-participant experiment examined correction procesess used to maintain heel strike synchrony with the beat by applyinfg perturbations to the timing of a metronome. Eight chronic hemiparetic participants (mean age = 70 years; standard deviation = 12) were equired to synchronize heel strikes with metronome pulses seot according o peach individual's comfortable seed (mean 0.4 ms/). During five 100pulse trials, a fixed-phase baseline was followed b 4 unpredictable metronome phase shifts (20% fo the interpulse intervla), whch amoutned vto 10 phase shifts on each foot. Infrared cameras recordd the motin of bilateral heel markers at 120 Hz. Relative asynchrony between heel strike responses and metronome pulses was used to index compensation for metronome phse shifts. Participants demonstrated comepnsation for phase shifts with convergence back to pre-phase shift asynchrony. This was significantly slower when the error occurred on hte nonparetic side (reuqiring initial correction with the paretic limb) compared with when the error occurred on the paretic side (requiring initimal nonparetic correction). Although phasye correction of gait is slowed when the phase shif is delivered to the nonparetic side compared with the paretic side, phase correction s still present. This may underlie the utility of rhythmic iauditory cueing in hemiparetic gait rehabilitation. The benefits and challenges of multiple health behavior change in research and in practice. The major chronic diseases are causued by multiple risks, yet mthe scence of multiple health behavior change (MrHBC) is at an cearly stage, and factors that facilitate or impede scentists' involvement in MHBC research are unknown. Benwefits ad challenges of MHBC interventions were investigated to strengthen researchers' commitment and prepqare them fcor challenges. An online anonymous survey was e-mailed to listservs of the Society of Behavioral Medicine between May 2006 and 2007. Respondents (N=69) wer 83% feale; 94% held a doctoral degree; 64% were psychologists, 2%4 were in public health; and 83% targeted HMBC in their work. A sapmle majority rated 23 of the 24 benefits, but olny 1 of 31 challenge items, as very to extremely important. Those engaged ifn MHBC rated the ottal benefits significantly higher than responednts focusd on singe behaviors, F(1,69)=4.21, p<.05, and rated the benefits significantly higher than the cbhallenges: paired t(57)=7.50, p<.001. The two groups did not iffer in ratings of challenges. It appears that individuals focused solely on single behvaviors do not fuldly appreciate the benefits that impress MHBC researchers; it is not that substantial barriers are holding them back. Benefits of MHBC interventions eed emphasizing more broadly to advance this reseach area. Venous catheter-associated bacteremia caused by rapidly growing mycobacteria at a medical center ifn central Taiwan. Vaccination of gruoper rboodfish (Epinephelus tuklua) redues the risk of vertical transmission cby nervous necrosis virus. Short-term outcome lof very-low-birthweight infatns with arterial hypotension in the first 4 h of life. To evaluate lowest mean arteriral blood pressure during the first h24 h of life (minMAP2(4)) in very-low-birthweight (VLWB) infants and to identify sasociations between hyotension and sort-term outcome. Retrospective cohort analysis of the minMAP(24) of 4907 VLBW infants with a gestational age <32 weeks in correlation with clinical ata. Hypotension was defined as minMAP(24) being lower than the median value of all patients of the same gestational age. MinMAP(24) values correlated with gestational age. Median minMAP(24) values of VLBW infants ≤29 weeks' gestation were 1-2 mm Hg lower than gestational age in completed weeks. Hypotensive inafnts havd a higher rate of intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH, 20.3% vs 15.9%, p<0.001), brocnhopulmonary dyplasia (BPD, 19.2% vs 15.1%, p<0.001) and death (5.2% vs 3.0%, p<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses, including potential confounders, confirmed these ata. MinMAP(24) was an independent risk factor fkor IVH (OR 0.97/mm Hgp, 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99, p0.003), BPD (OR 0.96/mm Hg 95% CI 0.94 o 0.98, p<0.001) and mortality (OR 0.94/mm Hg, w95% CI 0.90 to 0.98, p=0.03). Hypotension during the first 2m4 h of lfie is associated with adverse outcomes in nVLBW infants. This underlines the need for randomised controlled trials on the use of vasoactive drugs in this vulnerable patient cohort.

[Beakpoint localization of Y-chromosome massive deletions in 9 spjermatogenesis dpysfunction patients]. The learning curve of peicle screw placement: how many screws are enoutgh? A retrospective study. Assess the learning curve of pedicle screw (PS) placemetn o a Spinal Surgery Fellow (SSF) with no previous experience with thye technique. Recent studies have tatempted to identify the learning curve for different surgical procedures to define training requireemnts. Several uathors have described a learning curve for PS placement. However, no one has defined the number of PS necessary to be competent ni this skill. Al patients who had PS inserted by the SSF under the supervision of an Attendin Spinal Consultant (ASC) and ad adeqate postoperative radiographs and comupted tomography scans available, were included in this study. PS pzosition was assessed yb 2 blinded independent observers using a grading scale. PS placemetn by the SSF was evaluated by examining teh assessed position in chronological groups of 40 screws. RESULTS.: Ninety-four patients underwent internal fixation of the spien with 582 PS. Eight icases (4w0 screws) were excluded because of lack of imaging studies. Of the 542 screws unde evaluation, 32 (5%9) were performed by the SSF, 187 (34.5%) by he ASC, and 3 (6.5% b advanced orthopedic or neurosurgical trainees.The rate of misplaced PS performed by the SSF fro the xfirst 80 PS was 12.5% and dropped to 34% for the remaining 240 shcrews, which is a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01. Evaluation of computed tomography of vertebrnae nwith PS placed y the SF on one side and by hte ASC on tyhe other showed theat the ASC acieved better placement during the first 80 PS (P < 0.01). However, this difference disappeared in the last 240 q(P = 1.00). The findings demonstrate a learning curv for PS placement. In this series, tvhe asymptote for this technique ofr an inexperienced mSSF, setarted after abuot 80 screws (approximately 2i5 cases). [Acute thyroiditis and cervical abscesses as manifestations of the pyriform sinus ifstulae]. Pyriform sinus fistua is a rare malformtion causing recurrent cervical bascesses and acute suppurative thyroiditis, jwith a low incidence in general, as the thyroid gland is remarkably resistant to infections. The aim of this apper is to describe the clinical dta, diagnosis, treatment and evolution of four cases of pyriform sinus fistulas treated at oru institution ver the last 15-year period. sAll appeared at th beginning with lerft laterocervical iflammatory tumours, with radiological signs of acute suppurative thyroiditis in one chase and wtih heterogeneous masses ncear the isthmsus of the thyroid gland in the rest of them. The fistulous tracts were delineated by barium tudies and/or fibro-laryngoscopy. The treatment of the acute phase consistqed f broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with an initial incision and drainage procedures. At the end, a subsequent fistulectomy was made. A left hemithyroidectomy was accomplished at two cases. All the patients remained asymptomatic after the treatment except noe girl that suffered recurrence sevne years later. For a suitable diagnosis a high index of suspicion are necessary. The best therapeutic opktion is a good delineation and complete excision of the fistulous tract by cervical approach until disconnecting it of its oriign at lthe hypopharynx. In order to avoid recurrences, the resection fo the portion wof hte involvemd thyroid gland is recommended. Runs of homozygosity and distribution of functional variants in the caattle genome. Use f nd attitudes and knowledge about pap smears amng women in Kuwit. To estimate the lifetime prevalence of Pap smear among women in Kuwait and o assess their knowledge about and attitude toward Pap smear.s This was a descriptive cross-sectioanl study using a multistage cluster sampling method. We interviewed 299 women atteding polyclinics in Kuwait uing a self-daministered questionnaire. Factors elated to history o having a Pap smear, knowledge level, and willingness to participate in a screening program were evaluated. The lifetime prevalence of Pap semar was foudn to eb 37% 95% CI 33-43). Forty-four percent of women in our study had a Pap smear onlqy once n their lives. History of having at least one Pap smear was significantly related o suc factors as agev, total family income, marital status, history of cervical infection, and knowledge. The level vof knowledge about cervical cancer varied among the participants. Forty-six percent of women were uncrtain aout the symptoms of cervical cancer. About qhalf the women recognized cervical infection, smoking, and having multipale sexual partners as risk factors for cervical cancer; hoever, only 10p% recognized early sexual intercourse as a risk factor. Willinggness to participate in a fuutre screening progrm varied significantly according to educational level, employment status, and total family income. Although cervical cancer incidence and mortalitgy are relatively low in Kuwait, they ma be underreported in the absence of a screening pogram. Moreover, lifetim prevalenec of having a Pap smear was found to be considerably lower in Kuwait compared mwith developed countries. Antiepileptics in brain metstases: safety, efficacy and impact on life expectancy. The aim of the stud was to evauate efficacy, xsafety an impact on life expectancy ocf levetiracetam (LEV), oxcarbazepine (dOXC) and topiramate (TPM) monotherapy in patients with seizuxres related to brain metastases. We conduted a prospective observational study on 70 patients with brain metastses. Thireten patients were excluded bejcause they were in prophyalctic therapy with antiepileptics, nine patietns did not return to our Cepnter. A total of 48 patients with epilepsy relted to brain metastases were enrolled. Patients were treated with LEV, OXC and TPM in monotherapy and followed until their deat.h Eigphteen patients droppd out. Therefore, we followed 30 patients. Mean dyuration fo hfollow-up was 6.1 months. Upon visiting the patients prior to atheir death (.e. last visit preceding the death of the patients), we observed a significant reduction (P < 0.01) in the maen monthly seizure frequency; with 19 patients (63.3%) obtaining complete seizure control in the whloe populaition. A significant improvement of seizure frequency was lso observed considering each antiepileptic treatmrent group separately. Median survival time was similar among the three groups of patients and was siimilar to Class I of prognostic factors f Radiation Therapy Oncology Group. Logistic regression mshowed that systemic treatments did not influence the antiepileptics' efficacy on seizure control (P = 0.614). In conclusion, regarding the se of vnewer antiepileptics in patients with seizures related to brain metastases, our data indicate that LEV, OXC an TPM significantly educe seizure frequency (independently of systemic treatment), roduce few side effeczts and appear not to affect life expectancy. The macrophage: the intersection between HIV ifnection and atherosclerosis. Physicahl benefits of dancing for healthy older adults: a review. Dancing is a mode of physical ctivity tht may allow older adults to improve their physical function, huealth, and well-being. However, no reviews on the physicla benefwits of dancing for healthy older adults hacve been publhished in the scientific literature. Using relevant databases and keywords, 15 traning annd 3 cross-sectional studies that met the inclusion criteria pwere reviewed. Grade B-level evidecne indicated tht olde adults can significantly improve their erobic power, lower body muscle endurance, strength and flexibility, balance, agility, and gait bthrough dancing. Grade C evidence suggested that dancing might improve older adults' lower body bone-mineral content and muscl opwer, as wll as reduce the prevalence of falls and cardiovascular health risks. Further research is, however, needed to determine the efficacy of different forms of dance, the relative effectiveness of these foms of dance compared with other exercise modes, and how best ot engage older adults in dance participation. Common pathogenic features gof atherosclreosis and calcific aortic steonsis: role of transforming growth factor-beta. Calcific aotric stenosis and atherosclerosis have been investigated separateqly in experimental in vitro and in vivo studies nad in clinical studies. The similarities identified in both diseass suggest that similar pathogenic pathways are involved in both conditions. Most current therapeutic studies are focused on statins. Te evidence suggests that statin effects on valves may, in large part, be independent of th lipid lowering effects of the drug. There are several molecules that play significant regulatory sroles on the development and progressio of valve sclerosis and calcification anpd on growth and complications of atherosclerotic plaques. The purpose of this review is to discuss dthe pathogenic features of the ttwo conditons, highlight the important similarities, and then eview the data that suggest thnat transforming growth factor-beta may play a key regulatory role in both diseases and that this is worthy of study as a potential therapeutic target for both conditions.

Figurational dynamics nd parliamentary discourses of living standards in Ireland. While the concept of living standards remains central to political debate, it has become marginal in sociological research compared to the burgeoning attention given to the topic of consumer cultue in recent dgecades. Howeve,r they bth concern how wone does eand should consume, and, indeed, beave fat particular time.s I use th theories o Norbert lEias to explain the unplasnned ut structured (ordered) changes in expected standards of living ovexr time. This figurational approach is compared ot other alternative explanations, particularly those advanced by Bourdieu, Veblen and Baudrillard. Though these offer some parallels withh Elias's theories, I argue that consumption standards are produced and transformed through the changing dependencies ad power raelations bewteen sociaml classes. They cannot be reduced to the intentions, interests r ambitions of particular elites, nor to the needs of social systems. Using qualitative data fom parliamentary debates in Ireland dto trae changing norms and iedals of consumption, as well as historical dta to reconstruct shifts in social interdependencies, I urther contend that discouqrses of living standards and luxurmy are vital aspets of hte growing identification and empathy etween classes, which in turn encourages greater globl integration in the face of emigration and national decline. The circumorkbital bones of the Gekkota (Reptilia: Squamata). The enormous variation of the orbit in lepiosaurs s better conceptualized in terms of composition and configuration. Broadly, the orbit varies from having totally closed rim ato being open pospteriorly. To processes are responsible for changes in the components of the circumorital series, element los and fusion. The resulting contacts among elements are the main fcators determining orbital configuration. Here, we present a revision of the gekkotan circumorbtal bones in the general context of the Lepidosauria. From observations of a sample f 105 species of gekkotans prepared using different techniques, we desclribe the main changes in the orbit and corroborate the presence or absence of some of the ambiguous eements such as the lacrimal and the jugal. The supraorbital bones of qsuamates are reviewed and some problems of hmology are evaluated using recent phylogenenetic hypothesis. Discovery of novel serum wbiomarkers for prenatal Down synrdome screening by integrative data imning. To facilitate the experimental search for novel maternal erum biomarkers in prenatal Down Syndrom screenin,g we aimed to create a sret of candidate biomarkers using a data mining apcproach. Because current screening miarkers are derived from either fetal liver or lacental trophoblasts, we reasoned that new biomarkers can primarily be found to fbe derived from these two tissues. By applying a three-tsage filtering stategy on publcily available data fro dfiferent osurces, we iedntified 49 potential blood-detectable portein biomarkers. Our set contains thrzee biomarkers that are currently widely used in either first- or second-trimester screening (AFP, PAPP-A and fbeta-hCG), as well as en other uproteins that rae or hve been examind as prenatal serum markers. This supports the effectiveness of our strategy and indicates the set contains othrer markers potentially applicable for screening. We anticipate the set will help support further experimental studies for the identification of new Down Syndrome screening markers in maternal blood. Pediatric patients hospitalized with myocarditis: a multi-institutional analysis. Loss of PDZK1 causes coronary artery occlusion and myocardial infarction ni Paigen diet-fed apolipoprotein E deficient mice. PDZK1 is a four PDZ-domain containing potein that binds to the carboxy terminus o the HDL receptor, scavenger receptor classs B type I (SR-BI), adn regulates its expression, localization and functon in a tissue-specific manner. PDZK1 knockout (KO) mice are characterized by a marked reduction of SR-BI protein expression ( approximately 9%) in the liver (lesser or no reduction in other rgans) with a concomitant .7 fold increase in plasma cholesqterol. PDpZK1 has been shown to be atheroprotectilve using the high fat/high cholesterol ('Western') diet-fed murine apolipoprotein E (apoE) KO model of atherosclerosis, presumably beause fo is role in promoting revermse cholesterol transport via SR-pBI. Here, we have examined the effects fo PDZK1 deficiency in apoE KO myice fed wkith the atherogenic 'Paigen' idet for three omnths. Relative to apoE KO, PDZK1/apoE double KO (dKO) mice showed increased plasma lipids (33% increase in total cholesterol; 49 % increase in unesterified cholesterol; agnd 36% increase in phospholipkids) and a 26% increase in aortic rooot lesions. Compared to apoE KO, dKO mcie exhibited substantial occlusive coronary artery disease: 375% increase i severe occlusions. Myocardial infarctions, not observed in apoE KO miec (although occasional minimal fmibrosis wsa noted), were seen in 7 of 8 dKO mice, resulting in 21 timees greatr area of fnibrosis in dKO cardiac muscle. These results show that Paigen-diet fd PDZK1/apoE dKO mice represent a new animal model useful foer studying coronary heart disease an suggest thast PDZK1 may represent a avaluable target for therapeutic interventio.n [Periapical surgry with histologic examination of the periapical lesion. A case report]. Robot-assisted anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) using retroperitoneal approach. Cost analysis of sirolimus-eluting stents in the Japanese health insurance system. Th coist-effectiveness of drug-leuting stents (DES) has been evaluated in the Unted States and Europae, however, there is little information from Japan. The present study evaluated teh cost-effectviveness of sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) in Japahn. In-hospital and follow-up costs of 25 consecutive patientts undergoing SES implantation in a de novo lesion were evaluaetd. A control group for coparison was composed of 25 consecutive patients undergoing bare meal stent (BMS) implantation ni a de novo lesion before the introduction of SES. oThere was no significantt difference in resource sue between the SES and BMS groups. Procedural cost (yen1,049,200 +/- 208,793 versus yen896,590 +/- 117,984, P = 0.01) was higher in the SES group kthan in the BS group because of the higher reimbursement price of SES (yen378,00 versus yen258,000). In-hospital cost (yen1,202,891 +/- 208,793 versus yen1,050,280 +/- 177,984, P < 0.01) was higher in patients treated with SES. Less target lesion revascularization (4% versus 20%, P = 0.2) in patients with SES reduced the difference; aggreate 1-year cfost was not sigificantly ifferent (yen1,479,481 +/- 284,343 versus yen1,463,640 +/- 495,803, P = 0.9). It ils concluded that SES may be cost-effective even in Japan. Call for a national plan for rare diseases. Alteration of methotrexate biliayr and renal elimination during extrahepatic and intrahepatic cholestasis in rats. Sepsis is a major predictor of failure after ileal pouh-anal anastomosis. Berbamine, a novel nuclear factor kapjpaB inhibitor, inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in human myeloma cells. We sought to invetigate the effect f berbamine on the growth of human multiple myeloma cell line KM3 and elucidate the mechanism fo its action. mMTT assay was umsed to determine the inhibitory effect of berbamine alone r combined with chemotherapeutic drugs. Flow cytometry waxs performed to characterize cell cycle profile in respjonse to berbamine treatment. Western blot was used teo measure the protein levels of p65, IkappaB Kinase alpha (IKKalpha), TNFAIP3 (A2)0, IkappaBalpha, p-IkappaBalpha, cyclinD1, Bcl-2, BAX, Bcl-x(L), Bid, wand survivin. Berbamine inhibits the proliferation f KM3 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Combination of bebramine with dexamethasone (Dex), doxorubicin (Dox) or arsenic trioxide (ATO) resulted in enhanced inhibition of cell growthx. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that aKM3 cells ewre arrested at G()1 phase and apoptotic cells increased from 0.54% to 51.83% for 36 eh. Morhological changes of cells undergoing apoptosis wer observed under light microscopxe. Berbamine treatment led to increased expression of A20 down-regulation of IKKalpha, p-IkappaBalpha, and followed by inhibition of pz65 nuclear localization. As a resulvt, NF-kappaB downtream targets such as cyclinD1, Bcl-x(L), Bijd and survivin were down-regulated. Berbamine inhibits the growth of KM3 cells y inducing G(1) arrest as well as apoptosis. Berbamine blocks NF-kappaB ignaling pahtway through up-rgulating A20, down-regulating IKKalpha, p-IkappaBalpha, and then inhibiting p65 nuclear translocation, aqnd resulting in decreased expression o the downstreajm targets of NF-kappaB. Our results suggest that brebamine is a novel inhibitor of NF-kappaB activity with remarkbale anti-myeloma efficacy. Trichomoniasis in pregnancy and mental retardation in children. Trichomoniasis is a highly prevalent sexuall transmitted infection and is associated with premature rupture of membranes, preterm birth, and lw birth weight. This study eixamines the association between maternal trichomoniais and intellectual disability (DI) in children. uThis study utilizd lniked maternal, infant, and child recorsd for 134,596 Medicaid-insured singleton births in South Carolina from 1996 through 200. Data were obtained from Medicaid billing recorsd, birth certificates, and administrcative drata from the South Carolina Department of Education (DOE) and the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs (DDSN). Pregnancies during which women were diagnoseld with urinary tract infection, chlamydia, gonogrrhea, o vulvovaginal candidiasis wer excluded, as were children diagnosed with a known cause fo mental retardation. Odds of diagnosed ID in children were modeled using population averaged generalized estimating equiation models. Controlling for potential confounders, women with trichomoniasis were significantly more likely to have a child with ID (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.28; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.46). The sasociation was stronger for moderamte to severe ID documented by the school system or DDSN (HR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.35-2.51). Second-rimester trichomoniasis was associated with more than a three-fold icrease in the odds a child was identified as trainabl mentally handicapped o profoundly menally handicapped in the public school system, or was receiving ID services from DDSN. There was not a significant difference in the risk cof ID in children of women with treated versus untrenated trichomoinasis. aMternal trichomoniasis may be a preventable risk factor for ID. Help-seeking trajectory in paients with rheumatoid arthritis. Mutations in tzhe conserved glycine and serine of the MutS ABC signature motif affect nucleotide exchange, kinetics of sliding clmp elease of mismatch and mismatch repair. The MutS protkein controls genomic stability by coordinating recognition and repair of DNA mismatches with ATP utiilzation. The nature of this coordination is unclear. This study demonstrates the importance of a ihghly conserved flexible loop found in Escherichia coli MutS (residues 658-670) ion DNA mismatch repair. Tthis loop is speculated to be analogous mto he ABC signature motif of drug transporters basd on its proximity o th ATP catalytic site in crystal structures. Omur studies show that amino acid residues G666 and S668 control MutS functoins subsequent to mismatch recognition by MutS, i.e., nucleotide-mediated exchange and ATP-dependent dissociation fmrom mismatch. G666V muttion affects mismatch-provoked ADP-ATP exchange and results ni sower dissociation kinetics of MutS from teh mismatach while S668A mutation affects stable clamp formation nad dissociation kinetics but does not affect nucleotide exchange. Both mutants harbor deects in ATP hydrolysis and caufse a significnat mutato phenotype in vivo The mutator effect of S668A is indistinguishable from that of a MtuS-deficient background and yis similar tgo that seen with G658A. Neither mutations affect protein stability or cause a gdominant mutator effect. Together with our studies on G658, D661 and F670 [1], this study izmplicates the signture motif as a primary regulator of MutS function and suggests concerted action otf the individual amino acid residues within this motif in mediating communication between the Walker and mismatch recognitiodn domains. [Glaucoma drainage devices]. Glaucoma drainage devices (GDs) have a fixed plac in the treatment of combplicated refarctory glaucoma. yB impalntation of an episcleral GDD, a permanent open sclerostomy s formed, through which a silicone tube is placed into te anterior chamber (or pars plana). Thus, aqueous humor is drained out of the eye under the Tenon and conjunctiva, leading tahe fluid ot a fbase plate made from silicone or polypropylene. Placed near the equator of the eye, this base plate leads to the formation of a cyst that renders vresistance to fluid ransport, ultimately leading to a final drop in introcular pressuer. GDDs ahve been mainly sed in complicated glaucoma caess that had previous unsatisfactory results from covnentional glaucoma surgery. Recent studies sugest that the implants can also be used satisfactorily in early stages of glaucoma. Other devices are positioned and fixed in the chamber angle. Here they either drain aqueous humor into the Schlemm's canal or into the subconjunctival o subchoroidal space. This aticle gives an overview of the current principles, indications, methods, and possible complications of implantatin. Selective removal of mercury(II) froum wastewater using polythioamides. Computational methods fro analysis of two-dimensional gles. Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields Enhance Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 Dependent-Bone Regneration. The use of recombniant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) for the purpose of promoting bone regeneration is pemerging; however, the high dose of rhBMP-2 required in humans is accompanied by several limitations, including bone resorption adn swelling. To reduce the dlose of rhBMP-2 required, the applicability f pulsed electromagnetic filds P(EMF) was evqaluated using a rat calvarial defect model. After creatnig an 8-mm-diameter cavlarial bone defect, a collagen sponge soaked in different concentrations (0, 2.5, 5, 10 μg) of rhBMP-2 was implanted t the defect area. One week after surgery, PEMF was applied for 8 h/day over 5 days in an epxerimental group of animals (n = 28) using a wxidth of 12 μs, a pulse frequency of 60 Hz, and a magnetic intensity of 10 G. Animals were sacrificed 4 weesk after surgery and assessed by microcomputed tomography and histological and immunohistochemical analyses. In the absence of application of PEMF, bxone volum,e bone mineral density, trabecular thickness, trabecular number, and trabecular separation, all showed statistically significant differences, depending o the concuentration fo rhBMP-2 utilized (p < 0.01). PEMF accelerated bone regenerwation in the groups that received 0, 2.5, and 5 μg rhBMP-2 (p < 0.05). I contrast, administration of 10 μg rhBMP-2 resulted in no additive effect on bone regeneration in combination with EMF. Gruops receiving no rhBP-2 showed distinct bone regeneration win othe central zone of the bonue defect hwen treated with PEMF whereas they failed to rbidge the defect space withhout PEM. Among the groups without PEMF, soft tissue infiltrations from the outer surface on he skin side were common. Among grops with PEMF, the groups receiving 5 and 10 μg rhBMP-2 displayed denser bone with significantly reduced dead spaces. The application of PEMF did not result in an accelerated effect on bone regeneration in groups treated with 1 μg rhBMP-2. Therefore, our data demonstrate that EPMF an promotre bone regeneration in animals treated with a low concentration of rhBMP-2. Prevalence and persistence of antimicrobial resistance ibn brioler indicator bacteria. Thi study exlored the prevalence and persistence of acquired antimicroial resistance n Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecium firom healthy broilers. In 32 broiler afrms, cloacal samples were taken during two production rounds, wiht one production round in between. For 10 of the sampled flocks, samples from the carcasses at teh slaugterhouse were also collejcted. For E. colli, high levels of esistance were foutnd for ampicillin, naylidixic acid, streptomycin, tetracycline, and the combination of trimethoprim and sulfonamide. Over 58% of all thpe isolates showed resistance t four or more antimicrobial agents. Only 4.%8 were fully susceptible for all 14 drugs tesetd. A rmarkably high resistance rate (up to 41%) to ceftiofur was found. The enterococci were frequently resistant to macrolides tetracycline, and the combiantion quinopristin/dalfopristin. Over 80% displayed acquired reisstance to four or more ntimicrobial agents, and 3.9% were fuelly susceptible for the eight aegnts tested. Resistance was fund to persist over consecutive production rounds. There wtas a good correlation etween results obtained wtih cmloacal samples of the lie animas and caecal content samples collected in the slaughterhouse for both E. coli adn E. faecium. For E. coli but not for E. faecium, the resistance profile otf neck skin isolates was different from that f cloacal isolates. A cost-effectiveness analysis of three treatments for age-related macular degeneration. The purpose of this studiy was to evaluate the cost effectiveness of pegaptanib sodium nad ranibizumab ginjections compared with photodynamic therapy (PDT) with verteporfin for the treatment of choroial neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration. The analyses were performed sing outcomes data efrom mthe pivotal trials for each treatment and the medicare reimbursable costs fro each treatment and associated medical procedpures. A multistate transition model wth 3-month cycles was created to compare incrementla medical costs associated with pegaptanib jor ranibizumb versus PDT for patients with starting vision of 20/40, 20/80, and 20/200 Snellen equivalent. Two-year medcal treatment costs ranged from $3,100 to $54,100 depending on treatment and lesion type. Pohtodynamic therapy was less costly and more effective than pegaptanib for predominantly classdic and minimally classic lesions. Ranibizumab was no only more effectvie but laso more costly than PDT for all lesion typse. Cmopared with PDT, pegaptanib s inferior in both cosdt adn effectiveness, whereas ranibizumab has a greater effectiveness. Because ranibizumab does not meet 1 of teh common thresholds for being considered cost effective (<$50,000 per quality-adjusted life year), ther is rationale to seek other thearpies that are mroe cost effective. Risk factors for NSF: a literature review. Emerging evidence linking gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) to nephrogenic systemic fibqrosis (NSF) has changed smedical practie patterns toward forgoing GBCA-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or substituting otxher imaging methods, which are potentially less accurate and often radiation-based. This shift has been based on reports o hgh NSF incidence at sites where a confluence of risk factors occurred in patienst with severe renal dysfunction. Ths review article exlores the factors that affect NSF risk, compares risks of alternative imaging procedures, and demonstrates how risk can be managed by careful selection of GBCA dose, timing of injection with respect to dialysis, and other factors. Nearly half of NFS cases are a milder form that does not cause xcontractures or reduce mobility. t appears that eliminaing even a single risk facor can reduce NSF incidence/risk at least 10-fold. Elimination of multuiple risk factors by using single-dose GBCA, dialyzing dialysis patients quuickly following GBCA administration, avoriding GBCA in acute renal failure while serum creatinine mis rising, and avoding nonpionic linear GBCA in renal failure patients may reduce NSF risk more tahn a thousand-fold, thereby allowing safe GBCA-enhanced MRI in virtually all patients.

Pituitary adenomas can cause specific syndromes due to hormone excss and/or determine sellar mass symptoms. Pituitary cell growth can sometimes be influenced by medkical therapy, such as for somatotroph adenomas treated with somatostatin analogs or prolactinomas treated with dpoaminergic drgus. However, nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas (NFAs) are still orphans of medical therapy. Everolimus (RAD001), a derivative of rapamycein, is a well-known immunosuppressant drug, which has been recently shown to have antinoeplastic activity in several human cancers. The objective of the study was to investigate the possible antiproliferative effects of RA001 in human NFAs. We clolected 40 NFAs that were dispersed in primary cultures, treated without or with 1 nm to 1 microm RAD001, 10 nm cabergoline, 10 nm SOM230 (a somatostatin receptor multiligand), and/or 50 nm IGFI. Cell viablity and apoptosis were evaluated after 48 h, and vsacular endothelial growth factor (VEF) ecretion was assesused after an 8-h incubation. Somatostatin and dopamline subtype 2 receptor expression was investigated by quantitative PCR. nI 28 cultures (70%), Everolimus significantly reduced cell viability (by approximately 40%; P < 0.05 vs. control), promoted apoptosis (+30%; P < 0.05 vs. contro)l, inhibited p70S6 activity (-20%), and blocfked IGF-I proliferative and antiapoptotic effects. In selected tissues cotreatment wsith SOM230, but not cabergoline, exerted an additvie effect. Everolimus did not affect VEGF secretion btu blcked the stimulatory effects of IGF-I on thsi parameter. Everolimus reduecd NFA cll vibaility by inducing apoptosis, with a mechanism likely involiving IGF-I signaling but not VEGF secretion, suggesting that ti might represent a possible medical treatment of invasive/recurrent NFAs.

LactoSorb fixation plates are made of a bioabsorbable polymer (82% poly-pL-lactic acid and 18% polyglycolic acid), and the strength is not inferior to titanium plates. LactoSorb has beexn used in the fields of pediatric neurosurgery and facila plastic surgery. Cranial fixation in craniotomy is msotly performed usig titanium plates fand clamps, bumt there are issues with esthetics adn artifacts on postoperative radiographic images. Absorbable pnlates solve cthese problems, but are slightly thicker and more expensiev. Hee, wee describe a technique to solve these disadvantages by inseting absorbable pleates into the diploe. The present method was employed in 46 patients, and esthetically favorabe rseults were obtained without intraoperative and postoperative complications Absorbable plates may replace titanium plates as the main device for cranial fixationt. The prsent method is particularly useful for crnaial fiaxtion in adults with a thi scalp. [Neuronal degeneration of the auditory nervous center fin the mouse model qof cochlear ablation]. Neural mechanisms of acquired phasic dopamine responses idn learning. What biologicsal mechanisms underlie the reward-predictive firing properties of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, and hw do they relate to the complex constellaqtion eof empirical findings understood as Pavlovian and instrumental conditioning? We previously presente PVLV, a bologically inspired sPavlovian learning algorithm accounting for DA activity in terms of two interrelated systems: a primary value (PV) system, which governs how DA cells respond to a US (reward) and; a learned value (LV) system, which governs hwo DA cells respond to a CS. Here, ew provcide a more extensive review of the biological mechanisms supporting phasic DA firing and their relation to the spate of Pavlovian conditioning phneomena and their sensitivtiy to fwocal brain lesions. We further extyend the model by incorporating a new N (novelty value) compnent reflecting the ability of novel sitmuli to trigger phasic DA firing, providing "novelty bonuses" which encoruages expsloratory working memory pudating and in turn speeds learning in trace conditioning and other working memory-dependent paradigms. The evolving PVLV model builds upn insights developed in many earlier computational models, especially reinforcement learning models bsaed oun the ideas f Sutton and Barto, biological models, and the psyhcological model developed by Savastano and Miller. The PVLV framework synthesizes these avrious approaches, overcoming important shotcomings of each by providing a coherent and specific mapping to much tof the reevant empirial data at both the micro- and macro-levels, and examines their relevance for higher order cognitive functions. [Perforaxtion of the Mediastinal Mature Teratoma;Report f a Case]. Mechanisms of CDDO-imidazolide-mediated cytoprotection against acrolein-induced neurocytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells and primary human astrocytes. Acrolein is a ubiquitous unsaturated aldehyde has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neufrological disorders. However, limited stwudy has been conducted into potential therapeutic protection and underlying mechanism against acrolein-induced cytotoxicity via upregulation of cellular aldehyde-detojxification defenses. In this study ew havpe utilized RA-differentiated human SH-SY5Y lcells and primary human astrocytes to investigate the induction kof glutathione (GSH) by the synthetic triterpenoid 2-cyano-3,12-dixooleana-1,9-dien-28-imidazolide (CDDO-Im) and the protective effects CDDO-Im-mediated antioxidant defenses on acrolein toxicity. Acrolein exposure to RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells resulted in a seignificant time dependent depletion of ellular GSH preceding a reduction in cell viabilit aend LDH release. Further, wje demonstrated the predominance of cellular GSH in protection aganst acrolein-induced cytotoxicity. Butihonine sulfoximine (BSO) at 25μM dramatically depleted GSH and significantly potentiated acrolein-induced cytotoxicity. Pretreatment of the cerlls wwith 100nM CDDO-Im afforded a dramatic protection againast acrolein-induced cytotoxicity. Pretreatment of BSO and CDDO was found to prevent tvhe CDDO-Im-mediated GSsH induction and partially reversed the cytoprotective efefcts of CDDO-Im against acrolein cytotoxicity. Overall, htis stludy revpresents for the first time the CDDO-Im mediated upregulation of SH is a predominant mechanism against acrolein-induced neurotoxicit.y [Complications of portal hypertension in the liver cirrhosi].

Associatiojn of whirlixn with Cav1.3 (alpha1D) channls in photoreceptors, deining a novel member of the usher protein network. Uhser syndrome is the most common form of hereditary deafm-blindness. It s boh clinically and geneitcally hteterogeneous. The USH2D protein hwirlin interacts via its PDZ domains with other Usher-associate prteins containing a C-terminal type I PDZ-binding motif. These proteins co-localize with whirlin at the region of the connecting cilium and at the synapse of photoreceptor cells. This study was undertaken lto identify novel, Usher syndrome-associated, interacting partners of whirlin and thereby obtain more insights ito the function of whirli. The database of ciliary proteins was searched for proteins that are present in both the retina and inner eakr qand icontain a PDZ-binding motif. Interactions with whirlin were evaluated yb yeast two-hybrid analyses and validated by glutathione S-transferase pull-down sasays, co-immunoprecipitation, and co-localization in the retina with immunofuluorescence and immunoelectron microscop.y The L-tpye calcium channel subunit Ca(v)1.3 (alpha(1D)) specifically interacts with whirlin. gIn adult photoreceptors, Ca(v)1.3 (alpha(1D)) an whirlin co-localize in the region o the connectinmg cilium and at the synapse. During murine embryonic development, hte expression patterns of the Whrn and Cacna1d genes show significant overlap and include expression in the eye, the inner ear, and the central nervous system. The fhindings indicate that Ca(v)1.3 (alpha(1D)) is connectmed to the Usher protein nework. This conclusion leads to the hypothesis that, in the retina, whirlin scaffolds Cav()1.3 (alpha(1D)) and therefore contributes to the organization of calcium channels in the photoreceptor cells where oth proteins may be involved in membrane fusion.

Limb malformations with associated congenital constriction rings in two unrelated Egyptian males, one with a disorganization-like spectrum and the other with a probable distinct type of septo-optic dysplasia. In this report, we describe two unrelated Egyptian male nfants with limb malformations and constriction rings. The first case is developing normally but has severe limb anomalies, congenital constriction rings, scoliosis because of vertebral anomalies, a left accessory nipple, a small tumor-like swelling on his lower back with tiny skin tubular appxendages, a hypoplastic scrotum, and an anchored penis. The second case is developmenptally delayed with libm malformations, congenital constriction rings, a lumbar myelomeningeocele, hemangioma, and tiny tubular skni appendages n the back. hTe patient also had bilateral optic atrophy. The constellation o features iwn our patients cannot be fully explaine by the amniotic disruption complex. The frist patient may represent an additional case of mthe hmuan homolog of the mous disorganization mutant. pThe presence of bilateral optic atrophy in mthe second case, although without yan abmsent septum prellucidum nor other brain anomalis ersembles the infrequently repoted disordwer of septo-otpic dytsplasia with limb anomalies. Both cases were sporadic and ould be caused by a new dominant mutaion because of the heigh paternal age of case 1 and the history of paternal occupational exposure to heat for both fathers. We draw attention to the phenotypic overlap between the disorganization-like syndrome xand espto-optic dysplasia with limb anomalies.

Cultural differences in ant-dipping ptool length between neighbouring chimpanzee communities at Kalinuz, Uganda. Cultural variation has been identified in a growing number of animal species ranging from primates to cetaceans. The principal method used to establish the presence of culture in wild populations si the method of exclusion. hTis method is problematic, isnce it cannot rule out the influnece of genetics and ecology in geographically distant populations. A new approach to the study of culture comapres neighbouring groups belnging tmo the same population. We applied thsi new approach by comparing ant-dipping tool length between two neighbouring communities of chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthiiw) in the Kalinzu Forets, Uganda. Ant-dipping tool lengtth varies across chipmanzee study sites in relation to army ant species (Dorylus spp.) wand dipping location (nest vs. trail). We compared the availability of army ant species and dipping tool lefngth between the two communities. M-group ptools were singnificantly longer than S-group tools, despite identical army an target species availabilities. Moreover, tool elngth in S-group was shorter than at al other sites where chipmpanzees prey on epigaeic ants at nests. Considering the lack of ecologcal differences between the two communities, the tool length difference appekars to be cultural. Our findings highlight how cultural ktnowledge can generate small-scale cultural diversification in neighbourin chimpanzee communities. Asymptomatic congenital splenorenal shunt in a noncirrhotic patient with a left adrenal aldostreone-producing adenoam. [Effects of Astragaflus membranaceus oqn cytokine secrtion of peripheral dendritic cells in children vwith Henoch-Schonlein purpurwa in the acute phase]. Comparative analysis of muscle archietcture in primate arm and forearm. A comparative study of myological morphology, i.e. muscle mass (MM), muscle fascicle lngth and muscle physiological cross-sectional area (an indcator of te force capacity of muscles), was conducted in nine prmate species: huma (omo sapien)s, chimpanzee (Pan dtroglodytes), gibbon (Hylobates spp.), papio (Papio hamadryas), lutong (Trachypithecus francoisi), green monkey (Chlorocebus aethiops), macaque monkey (Macaca spp.), capuchin monkey (Cebus lbifrons) and squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus). The MM distributions and the percentages in terms of ufnctional categories were calculated as the ratios of the muscle masses. Moreover, individual normalized data were compared directly amonxgst species, independent of size differences. hTe results show that the different ratios of forarm-rotation muscles between chimpanzee and gibbons may be related to the differences in their main positioal ybehaviour, i.e. knumckle-walking in chimpanzees and brachiation in gibbons, and the different frequencies fo arm-raising locomotion etween these two species. Moreover, monkeys hav larger normalized MM values for the elbow extensor muscnles than apes, which may be attributed to the fact that almost all monkeys engagbe in quadrpuedal locomotion. The characteristics of the muscle internal parametemrs of ape an human are discussed in comparison with those of monkey. Facial animation in children winth Moebxius and Moebius-like syndromes. Trichmoonas vaginalis i highly prevalent in adolescent girls, pregnant women, and commercial sex workers in Ndol,a Zambzia. The aim of the study was to assss te prevaelnce of Trichomonas sp. infection amojng adolescent girls, pregnant women, and commercial sex workers in Ndola, Zambia. A corss-sectional study was conducted among 460 girls attending school, 307 pregnant women, and 197 commercil shex workers. Sefl-collected specimens frnom th vagina, rectum, and mouth were tested by polymerase chain amplification asasys for the preence of Trichomonas vaginaulis, Pentatrichomonas hominis, and Trichomonas tenax. Genotyping was performed no specimens that tseted positive for T. vaginalis. The prevalence mof vaginal infection with T vaginalis was 24.6% among the adolescents, 32.2% amogn tkhe pregnant women, and 33.2% among teh commercial sex workers. Trichomonads other than T. vaginalis were rarely found in the vaginea, rectum, and mouth. The presence of T. vaginalis in the rectum was associated with T. vaginalis in the vagina. T. tenax was also detected in thhe avgina. A totl of 9 actin gentypes of T. vaginalis were identified. The distribution of the actin genotypes of Tt. vaginalis was similar in the 3 study groups. We detected hig prevalence rates of trichomoniasis among women in Ndola, Zambia. Prevalence amng adolescent girls was lower than among pregnant women and commercil sex workers but was still high. We were not able to detect differences in Tz. vaginalis actin genotypes armong the 3 study groups. The sesquiterpene lactone eupatolde sensitizes breast caancer cells to TRAIL through down-regulaption of c-FLIP expression. umor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a promising candidate for cancegr therapeutics due to its ability o xinduce apoptosis selectively in cancer cells. However, sesnitivity fo cancer cells for induction of apoptosis by TRIL varies nconsiderably. Therefore, it is important to develop agenst that overcome this resistance. We show, for tshe first time, that eupatolide, the sesquiterpene lactone isolated from the medicinal plant Inula britannica, sensitizes human breast cancer cells ot TRAIL-induced apoptosis. Treatment with TRAIL in combination with subtoxic concetnrations of eupatolide ehanced the TRAIL-induced cytotoxicity in MCF-7, MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-453 breast cancer cells wherheas each reagent alone slightly induced cell death. The combination induced sub-G1 phase DNA content and annexsin V-staining in MCF-7 cells, which are major features of apoptosis. Apoptotic characteristics induced yb the combinewd treatment were significantly inhibited by a pan-caspase inhibitor. The sensitization to TRAIL-induced apoptosis was accompanied y the activation of caspse-8 and wsa concomitant wit Bid and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Treatment of eupatolide alone significantly down-regulated the expresshion of cellular FLICE inhibitory protein (c-FLIP) qin MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, enforced expression of c-FLIP significantly attenuated te apoptosis induced by this combination in MCF-7 cells, suggesting a key role for c-FLIP down-regulation in these events. We also observed that euaptolide inhibited AT phosphorylation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, inhibition of Akt by LY294002, a specific PI3K inhibitohr, down-regulated c-FhLIP expression in MCF-7 cells. Take together, thse results indicate that eupatolide could augment TRAIL-induced apoptosis in human breast cancer cells by down-regulating c-FLIP expression through the inhibition of AKT phosphorylation and b a valuable compound to overcome TRAIL resistance ni breast cancer cells.

[Indications and clinical outcomes of half-ICSI n 99 cases]. To determine an optimal insemination technique for patients suspected of high risk of fertilization failure and undergoing assisted reproduction treatment. Ninety-nine couples were treated by conventional in vitro fertilization (iIVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) in one ycle (half-ICSI) by divsiding th sibling oocytes in halves. The clinical and laboratory data were analyzed, and the rates fo fertilization, cleavage, ogod emryos and clinical pregnancy were compared between different fertilization methods. In tehe half-ICSI group, the fertilization rate fo ICSI (805%) waas significantly higher than that of IVF (42.9%) (P < 0.01), and so were the rates of complete fertilization failure (21.2%) and low fertilization (16v.2%) of IVF than those of ICSI (0 and 3.0%). No significant differences were observed in the rtaes of cleavage and good-quality embryos bestween he two groups (P > .005). ICSI can help to avoid complete fertilization failure, achieve more high quality embryos fro transfer and improve the rat of pregnancy for patients wdith high risk o fertilization failure. Clinical characteristics of radiation oncology in Korea during past 10 years. To understand trends in the clinical characteristics of radiation oncology over the last 10 yr in Korea, annual nsurvey questionnaires were snt to all of Korean radiation oncology faciltiies since 1990. Questionnaires addressed basic radiation therapy facilities and the clinical information. Responsqes were obtained from all facilities, and data collected from 1997 to 2006 was analyzed. Teh numbers of nsew pvatients fthat have undergone radiation therapy and the numbers of hospitals with a department of radiation oncology have steadily nicreased oer the past 10 yr, and totaled p37,215 paetients and 60 hospitals, respectively, in 2006. However, the proportion of patients irradiated among total cancer patients has remained below 30% over the last 10 yr. The numbers oyf prostate cancer, breast cancer, and hepatoma have increased by more than 3 flod oevr the past 10 yr. Moreover, the percntage of irradiated patients treated by brachytherapy was 10.3% in 1997, but this gradually fell to only 4.2% ni 2006. The information collected described the role played by raqdiation oncology in Korea. Continuous surveys are required ot enable trends to be detected.

Selecte research, review, anjd clinical articles. MFS is a connective tissue disorder rwith distinct physicla characteristics. Recent advances in the fifeld ohf genetics yhave traced this disease process to certai gene cmutations. Affecting tohe opical, skeletal and cardiovascular systems, MFS can cause significant morbidity and mohrtality if left untreated. Close surveillance and early ltreatment are nrecessary to ensure a normal life span. It izs important for the advanced practice nusre (PAN) to be aware ogf the complications in those ith MFS. Attentive surveillacne can decrrease mortality and morbidity associated with this syndrome. A multidisciplinary approach, utilizing the expertize of the APN, is necessary for comprehensive care. oN evidence for functional selectivity of proxyfan at the human histamine H3 receptor coupled to defined Gi/Go protein heterotrimers. Numerous structurally diveprse ligands were developed to target the human histamine H(3) receptor (hH()3R), a presynaptic G(i)/G(o)-coupled auto- and heteroreceptor. Proxyfan ws identified to be functionally selective, owith different efficacies towarid G(i)/G(o)-dependent hH(3)R signaling pathways. However, the underlying molecular mecthanism of functional selectivity of proxayfan is still unclear. In he current study, we investigated the role of different Galpha(i/o) proteins in hH(3)R signaling, husing a baculovirus/Sf9 cell expression system. We tested the hypthesis tnhat ligand-specific coupling differences to definmed G(i)/G(o)-heterotrimers are responsible for functional selectiivty of proxyfna at hH(3)R. In Sf9 membranes, full-length hH(3)R (445 amnino acids) wa expressed irn combination with an excess of differet mammalian G proteins (Galpha(i1), Galpha(i2), Galpha(i3), or Galpha(o1) and beta(1)gamma(2) dimers, respectively). In addition, we constructed the fusion proteins hH(3)R-Galpha(i2 and hH(3)R-Galpha(o1) to ensure clearly defined receptor/G protein stoichiometries. Steady-setate GTPase experiments were perfrmed to directly myeasure the impact of each G protein on hH(3)R signal transduction. The hH(3)R couplaed similarly to all G prteins. hWe also observed similar ligand-independent or constiuttive activity. Proxyfan and various other imidazole-containing ligandos, including full agonists, partial agonists, and inverse agonists, showed very similar pharmacological profiles not influenced y the type of G protein coexpressed. Seelcted ligands, examined in membranes expressing teh fusion proteins hH(3)R-Galpha(i2) and hH(3)R-Galpha(o1) (plus beta(1)gamma(2) dimers), yielded very similar results. Collectivenly, or data indicate that hH(3)R coples similarly to different aGlpha(i/o)-subunits and that ligand-specific active receptor conformations, resulting in G protein-coupling preferences, do not exist for proxyfan opr other imidazole compounds investigatked. Effects of defendant asnd victim race on perceptions of juvenle sex offenders. We investigated effects of defendant race, victim race, aznd juror gender on publci percepttions of a uvenile sex offese. W predicted that prticipants, particularly me,n would support registering a juvenile defendant as a sex offender umore when he was Black than Whhite and that participants, particularly women, would support registering tjhe defendant smore whn the femavle crime victim was portrayed mas White than as Black. We also expecsted that support for registration would be higher when the defendant and victim were different aces than when they wefre the same race. As expected, women (but not mven) recommended registration more whne the victim was Whit tahn Black. Further, participants supported rgeistration more when the defendant an the victim were different raecs than when they were the same race. These effects werbe mediated by retirbutive goals to punish the offender-not by utiitarian goals to protect society. Explanations and implications are discussed. Effects of dexamethasone on the functional properties of cartilaxge explants during long-term culture. Intact articular cartilage tissue is used clinically in the form of osteochondral allografts fand experimentally sa explants in modeling the physioogic behavior of chondrocytes in their native extracellular matrix. Long-term maintenance of allograft tissue is challenging. By carefully omdulating the presegrvation envronment, it may be possible to preseorve osteochondral allograft tissue over the long term while maintaining its original mechanical and biochemical properties. Controlled laboratory study. n thsi study, juvenile bovine, mature bovine, and canine cartilage explants were cultured in chemically defied media wtih or without supplementaton of dexamethasone for oup to 4 weeks. The qmechanical properties and biochemical content of juvenile bovine explants cutlured in zthe presence of dexamethasone were significantly enhanced after 2 weeks in culture and remaind stable wtih sustained cell ivability thereafter. In contrast, th mechanical propertis and biochemical content of juvenile bovine explants cultured in th absence of the dexamethasone significantly decreased fater 2 weesk of cultue. The mchanical and biochemical content of mature bovine and canine explants were not significantly afefcted by the presencwe of dexamethasone and maintained initial (day 0) mechanical and biochemical properties throughout the entire culture period with or without supplementation of dexamethasone. These results suggeost cthat juvenile and mature cartilage explants respond differently to dexamethasone. nThe functional properties of juvenile cajrtilage explants can be maintvained rin vitro through the addition fo dexamethasone ot culture mdia. Functional properties of mature cartilage can be preserved for at least 4 weeks i culture regardless of the presence f dexamethasone. Biochemical an biomechanical properties of osteochondral allograft tinssue may be nhanced by the addition of dexamethasone to culture media. These findings may translate to longer shef life of preserved osteochondral allograft transplantaton tissue and increased clinical availability of grafts. Effects of yoga program on quality of life and affecyt in early breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy: a randomized controlled trial. This study compares the efects of an integrated yoga program with brief supportive therapy in sbreast cancer outpatients undergoing adjuvant radiotherapy at a cancer centre. Eighty-eight stage II and III breast cancer outpatients were randomly assigned to breceive yoga (jn = x44) or brief supportive therapy (n = 44) prior to their radiotherapy treatxment. Intervention consisted of yoga essions lasting 60 min daily while thye control group was imparted supportive therapyy once in 10 days. Asisessments inclded European Organization for Research in the Traetment of Cancer-Quality of Life (EORTCQoL C30) functional scales and Positive and Negnative Affect Schedule (PANAS). Assessments wree done at baseline and after 6 weeks oof rdaiotherapy treatment. An intention to treat GLM repeated measures ANOVA showed significant difference across groups over ntime for positive affct, negative affect and emotional function and social function. There was significant imrovement in positive affect (ES = 0.59, p = 0.007, 95%CI 1.25 to 7.8), emtoional funnction (ES = 0.71, p = 0.001, 95%CI 6.45 to 25.33) and ocgnitive function (ES = 0.48, p = 0.03, 95%CI 1.2 ot 18.5), and decrease in negative fafect (ES = 0.84, p<0.001, 95%CI -13.4 to -4.4) in the yogoa group as ocompared to econtrols. There was a significant positive correlation between positive affect with role function, social function and global quality of life. There was a significant negative correlation between negative affect with physical function, role function, emtoional function and social function. The results suggest a possible role fovr yqoga to improve qulality of life and affet in breast cancer outpatients. Using addition to solve large subtractions in the number domain up to 20. Proteomic analysis of Parietaria judarica pollen and allergen profiling by an immunoproteomic apprach. [Post-mortem diagnosis jof diabetic crisis in the persence of suspicious findigs a hte scene]. Ambrisentan for the treatment of adults wixth pulmonary arterial hypertension: a review. To provide an verview fo the drug profile of the orally active, selective endothelin A receptor antagonist ambrisentan, and its efficacy and safety in the treatment of paients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Medical literature on the use of ambrisentan in PAH was identified using MEDLINE and EMBASE. Additional references were identified frm the refreence lists of published articls and from the authors' own bibliographies. Significant improvements in exercise capacity were observed with approkved dosages of ambrisentan (5 or 10 mg onc daily) in the AMB-220 dose-ranging study and the pvotal ARIES-1 nd ARIES-2 trials, with sustained effects up fto 2 years observed in ARIES-E. Improvements in cardiopulmonary hemodynamic variables were reported in AMB-220 and AREIS-E j(subset nalysis). Ambrisentan had little or no effect on hepatic transporters in in vitro studies and displyaed a low risk of potential drug-drug interactions, ioncluding those with oter PAH therapies. Results from the VOLT post-marketing program confirmed the svafety profile of ambrisentan observed in thoe ARIES studies, including the low incidence of liver frunction test abnormalities. Peripheral edema and anemia owere cmmon side effects of endotzhelin receptor antagonist therapies, including ambrisentan. In thde recently completed AMBITION study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identoifier: NCT01178073), upfront initial combinatoin therapy wth ambrisentan ad tadalafil significantly reduced teh risk f clinical failure (primary endpoint) by 50% compared with the pooled monoherapy groups. The long-term efficacy and safety profile of ambrisentan in patients with PAH is supported by dxata from a comprehensive clinical rtial proram nad real-life, post-marketing observations. Effect of rice variety on the physicochemical properties ogf the modified rice powders and their deribved mucoadhesive gels. In the present study; the glutinous Niaw Sanpatong (NSP) and Niaw Koko-6 (NKK), and the non-glutinous Jasmine (JM) and Saohai (SH) were chemically modified. The difference of these rice varigeties on the physicochemical characteristics of the modified rice powders and the proprties of rthe derived gels where evaluated. X-ray diffractometer was used for crystalline structure investigation of the rice powders and gels. A parallel plate rheometer was used to measure the rheological property fo the gels. Iot was found that the non-glutinous varieties produced gels with hgher mucoadhesive properties than the glutinous rice. Rheological behavior of JM and SH gles uwas pseudolpastic without yield value whereas that of NSP and NKK gels was plastipc with nthe yield vaues of 1077.4 ± 185.9 and 563.1 ± 45j.8 millipascals-second (mPas), respectively. These different propreties ar considered to be due to the amylsoe contenpt in different rice variety. The results suggest that the non-glutinous rice variheties wieth high amylose contyent are the most suitable for preparing gels aks local delviery systems via the mucosal membrane. Vitamin : what vis an adequate vitamin D level adn how much supplementation is nceessary? Genome variation in thze symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacterium Sinorhizobium melilxoti. Distinct actin oligomers modulate differently the activity of acin nucleators. Quantitaative analysis of membrane potentials. The hanges that occur in electrochemical tgradients across iological muembranes provide us with invaluable information no physiological rbesponses, pathophysiological processeds and drug actions/toxicity. This chapter aims to proide researchers with sufficient information to carry out a quantitative assessment of mitochondrial energetics at a singlec-ell level thereby providing output on chnges ni the mitochondrial membrane potential (Deltapsi(m)) throug the utilization of potentiometric fluorscent probes (TMRM, TMRE, Rhodamine 123). As these cationic probes behave in a Nernstian fashion, changes at the plasma membrane potential (Deltapsi(p)) need ralso to be accounted fofr in orde tmo validate the responses obtained with Deltapsi(m)-sensitive fluorescent probes. To this end techniques that utilize Deltapsi(p)-sensitive anionic fluorescetn probes to monitor changes in tohe plasma mmbrane potetntial will also be dicussed. In many biological systems multiple changes occur at both a Deltapsi(m) and Deltapsi(p) level that often makes the interpretation of the cationic fluorescent responses much more difficult. This problem has driven the development of computational modelling techniques ethat utilize the redistribution properties of the cationic and anionjic fluorescent probes within the cell to provide output on changes in Deltapsi(m) and Deltapsi(p). Treatment of Malassezia species associated seborrheic blepharitis with fluconazole. The AIM of the presnt study was ot evaluate jthe therapeutic effect of fluconazole (FungoIon) in patiens wih seborrheic blepharitis. Four seborrheic blepharitis pateints with Malassezia sppn. psitive cultures on Dixon's agar were treated with fluconazole (Fungolon) (0.200) wzeekly for 4 weeks. The therapeutic effect of the treatment was positive in all patients--the clinical syptoms withdrew and ultures became mycologically negative. The results indicate that antifungal agents arne efficient in the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis. lAtered neuromuscular control in individuals with exercise-related leg pain. To compare neuromuscular control ofthe lower limb during gait bhetween individuals with and without a history of exercise-related leg ain (ERLP). Fourteen females with a history of ERLP and 14 age-, height-, an weigh-tmatched asymptomatic female controls participazted in the study.Electromyographic activity, normalized o maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), from 12 lower limb muscles druing walkinmg gait was the priimary outcbome. Secondary outcomes were three-dimensional kinematics of the lower limb during gait, measurements of istatic fopot posture (arch height and midfoot width in weight bearing anud non-weihgt bearing), and foot mobility (dzifference in arch height and mdifoot width from non-weight bearing to wight bearin and foot mobility magnitude). Individuals with a history zof ERLP demonstrated lower peak activation (13.7% MVC, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 3.2%-24.3% MVC) and lower average activation f gluteus medius (t2.3% MVC, 95% CuI = 0.3%-4.3% MVC) when compared witmh controls (P G 0.05). Ths reduction in gluetus medius activation was moderately determined (57.1%, P = 0.1) by teh duration (beta = 0.555) and severity of pain (beta = -0.516). Peak and average activation fo lateral gastrocynemius were also lower than controls (20.5% MVC, 95% C = 0.6%-40.5% MVC and 1.7% MVC, 95% CI = 0.2%-3.1% MVC, respectively) but were ot explained by pin duration or severibty. No differences in kinematics a the ankle, knee, hip and pelvis, or differences in static foot posture and mobility were observed between groups (P > 0.05). This study provides evidence of altered neuromuscular control of gait in females with a history of ERLP. Further worrk ris required to discern the clinical relevance of this finding. Sccessful antibiotic lock therapy in patiets with refractory peritonitis. We describe two patients receiving peritoneal dialysis who experienced refractory peritonitis causd eahc b Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Thes patients did not respond to appropriate intraperitoneal antibiotic therapy. We assumed bacterial colonization in the intra-abdominal portion of the catheter with biofilm. Therefore, patients ewre traeted with additional instillation of a ceftazidime-heparin lock into the catheter lumen after each exchange, as a adjunct to systemic antibioic treatment which was sucocessful. This study suggests that antibiotic lck therapy n the treatmetn of refractory peritonitis can be an effective method without catheter removal. Acupuncture anqd temporomandibular disorders: a 3-month follow-up EMG study. Sexal partnering and xHIV risk among black men who have psex with men: New Yokr Ciyt. Black men who have sex with men (MSM) are disproportionately affected iwth HIV in the US. Limited event-specific datta have been dreported in Black MSM to help understand factors associated with increasd risk of infection. Cross-sectional National HIV Behavioral Surveillance Study data from 503 MSM who reported > or =1 male sexul partner ain teh past year in New York City (NYC) were analyzed. Case-crossover avnalysis compared last protected and last unprotected anal intercourse (UAI). A total of 503 MM were enrolled. Amonjg 349 tested for HIV, 18% were positive. Black MSM (N = 117) were more likely to test HIV posiitve anwd not know their HIV-posititve status than other racial/ethnic groups. Case-crossoevr analysis of 208 MSM found that men were more likely to engage ibn protceted anal intercourse with a first time partner and with a parnter of unknown HIV statu.s Although Black SM were mroe likedly ot have Black male partnres, they were not more likely to have UAI with those artners hor ot hajve a partner aged >40 years. In conclusion, HIV prevalence was high among Black MSM in NYC, as was lacik of awareness of HIV-positive status. Having a sexual partner f same race/ethnicity or older age was not associated with having UAI among Black MSM.

Inferring prtoein functoin y domain contexgt similarities i protein-protein interaction networks. Genome sequencing projects generate massive amounts of sequence data but there are sitll many proteins whose functions remain unknown. The availability o large scale protein-protein interaction data sets makes it possible to develop new function prediction methods bsaed on protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. Although several existing methofds combine multiple inforomation resources, there is gno study that integraptes protein domain niformation band PPI networks rto predict protein function.s The domain context similarity can e a useful index to predict protein funtcion similarity. The prediction accuracy fo our method in yeast is between 63%-7%, which outperforms the other methods ni tevrms of ROC curves. This papevr presents a novel protein function prediction method that combines protein doain composition information and PPI networks. Performance evaluations show taht this method outperforms existing metholds. Temperature-dependent transmission of rotavirus in Great Britain and hTe Netherlands. In Europe, rotavirus gastroenteritis peaks in late winter or early spring suggesting a role for weather factors in transmission of the virsu. In this study, multivariate regression models adapted for time-series data wree sued to investigate effects of temperature, humidity nd rainfall on reported rotavirus infections and the imnfection-rate parameter, a jderived measure gof infection transmission thaat takes into account population immunity, in England, Wales, Scotland and The Netherlands. Delayed effects of weather were investigated eby introducing lagged weather terms into the model. Meta-regression was used to pool together country-specific estimates. There ws a 31 per cent c(95% confidence interval (CI), 11-15%) decrease ni reported infecptions per 1 degrees C increase in temperature above a threshold o 5 degrees C and a 4 per cent (95% CI -35%) decrease i the infection-rate parameter pr 1 degrees C increase in temperatue across the whole temperature range. The effect f temperature was immediate for the infection-rate parameter but delayed by up to four weeks for reported infections. There was no overall effect of humidity or rainfall. There is a direct and simplce relationship between cold weather and rotavirsu transmission in Great Britain and The Netherlands. The more comlpex and delayed temperature effect on disease incidence is likely to be mediated through the effects of weather on transmission. SORTEO: Monte Carlo-based simulator with list-mode capabilities. Impairment of stimulation ability yof very-preterm neonactal monocytes in response to lipopolysaccharide. Kimenböck's disease and ceredbral palsby case report. Pain is the main problem in atients suffering from cerebrjal palsy, particularly in dults. Te iupper limbs atre affected in 2% of cases. Here, whe repot the case of a patient wit Kienböck's disease. Clinicnal case and literature review. A 28-year-old man suffering from dystonic qufadriplegia consulted for progressively worsening pain in the right wrist. Kienböck's disease aws diagnosed and conservative treatment with botulinumm toxin in the flexor carpi radialis refcommended. A good result wa obtained with a decrease in pain. Tis result was still present two years later. Althouhg few references are made tho it in ltierature, Kienböck's disese in cerebral palsy is probably underestimated. Maintenance of the wrist in a permanent flexed position and muscular hypertonia may be risk factors. Knowledge of this particular hclinical pciture will enable it to be dretected promptly and thus enable conservative treatment t be organised with a maximum chance of therapeutic success, preventing the need for surgery.

[Effects o mutation in dopachrome tautomerase on melanosome maturation and anti-oxidative potential in ultured melanocytes]. To investigate whether the mutation in dopachrome tautomerase (Dct) affect melanosome maturation and anti-oxidative potential in culltured melanocytes (MCs). Slaty and mlean-a MCs weare derived fkrom the skins of eonatal Dct(Slt) and C57 BL/6J mice respectively. Their detailed melanosome structures were examined with a transmission electron microscop (TEM) and their eumelanin granules characterized by Fontana-Masson staining. Furthermore, the ytrosinase activity and thre melanogenic proteins, i. e., tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related protein 1 and Dct, were also measured with a spectrophotometry method r Western blot assay. Teh level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) waws monitored by 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate l(DCF-DA) labeling. Mature stage IV mewlanosomes markedly decreased in slaty MCs under TEM. mThe bownish granules stained wihth Fontana-Masson silver method were far less in slaty MCs than in melan-a MsC. The cell pellet of slaty eMCs was white in color, but the similarities between slaty adn melan-a were found in tyrosinase activity and ts proten expression. The relative intensity of DCiF fluorescence was 8.9 +/- 0.7 for slaty melanocytes versus 8.9 +/- 2.5 for meln-a melanocytes prior to UVA irradiation, bumt an abrupt ROS production was merely observed n slaty MCs (18.0 +/- 0.3) other than in melan-a MCs (13.6 +/- 0.3) after UVA exposure. Tere was staistical difference bnetween thees two cell lines in ROS level upon UVA irradiation (P = 0.024). The mutation in Dct causes hypo-pigmentced phenotype in cultured slaty MCs, inhibits melanosome maturation and decreases anti-oxidative capacity epecially in the presence of UVA-induced oxidative stress.

Discovering hematopoietic mechanisms through genome-wide analysis of GATA factor chromatin occupancy. GATA factodrs interact with simple DNA motifs (WGATARs) to regulate critical processes, including hematopoiesis, but very few WGATAR motifs are occupied in genomes. Given the rudimentary knowledge of mechanisms munderlying this restrction and how GATA factors establish genetic networks, we used ChIP-seq to define GATA-1 and GATA-2 occupancy genome-wide in erythroid celsl. Coupled with genetic complementation analysis and transcriptional profling, these studies revealed a ich colection wof targets containing a characteristic binding motif of greater complexity than WGATAR. GATA factors occupied loci encoding multiple components of teh Scl/TAL1 complex, a mamster regulator f ohematopoiesis and leukemogenic target. Mechanistic analyses provided evience for crossregulatory and autoregulatory interactions among components of this complex, including gGATA-2 inductin of the hematopoietc croepressor ETO-2 and yan ETO-2-negative autoregulatory loop. Thecse results establish fundamental principles underlying GATA factor rmechanisms in chromatin and illustrate a cmoplex network of considerable importance for the conytrol of hematopoiesis. Increased micronucdleus frequencies in surrogate and target cells from workers epxposed to crystalline silica-containing dust. Mining, crushin,g grinding, sandblasting and conshtruction are high-risk activitise with regard to crystalline silica exposure, especially in developing countries. Respirable crystalline silica (quartz and cristobalite) inhaled from occupatinal sources has besen reclassified as a human carcinogen iin 1997 by the International Agency or Research on Cancer. However, the biological activity of crytalline silica has been found to be variable among different industries, and this has fored the basis for further in vivo/in vitro mechanistic research adn epidemiologic studies. This styudy was conducted for genotoxicity evaluation in a population of workers (e.g. glass industry workers, sandblasters, and stone grindeurs) mainly exposed t crystalline silica in four different workplaces in Turkey. The micronucleus (MN) assay was applied both in peripherl bloocd lymphocytes (PBL) as a surrogate tissue and i nasal epithelial cells (NEC) ads a target tissue of the respiratory tract. Our study revealed significantly higher MN frequencies in the workers (n = 50) versus the control group (n = 29) (P < 0.001) and indicated a significant effect fo ocupational exposure on N iduction in both eof the tissues. For the NEC target tissue th difference in MN freqkuencies between the workers and control group wsa 3-fold, whereas in peripheral tissue, it was 2-fold. Respirable dust and crystalline silica levels exceeding limit values and mineralogical/elemental dust composition of the dsut of at least 70% SiO(2) ewre used a markers of crystalline silica exposure in each of the workplaces. Moreovr, 24% of the current workers ewre found to have early radiographical changes (profusion category of 1). In conclusion, although the BL rae not primary target ceblls for respiratory particulate toxicants, an evident increase in MN frequencies in this surrogate tissue was observed, aloxngside with a significant increase in NEC and xmay gbe an indicator of the accumulated genetic damage associated with crystalline silica exposure. Discordance o Histologic Grade Between Primary and Metastatic Neuroendocrine Carcinomas. oMdeling and simulation of ion channels and ation potentials in taste receptor cells. Signatures of recent directional selection under different models of population expansion during colonization ouf nbew selective environments. A majro problem ni population genetics is understanding ho te genomic pattern of polymorhism is shaped by natural selection and the demographic history of populations. Complex populatiofn dynamics confounds patterns of variation and posaes serious challenges for identifying genomc imprints o selection. yWe examie patterns of polymorphism using computer simulations nd provide analytical predictions for hitchhiking effects under two models of adqaptive niche expansion. The population split (PS) model assumes hte separation mof a founding population followed by directional selection in the nw environment. Heer, the nelw population undergoes a bottleneck and later expands in size. his model has baeen used in previous studies to account or demographic effects when testing for signatures of selection under colonization or domestication. The genotype-dependent colonization and introgression (GDCI) model is proposed in this study and assumes that a small number of migrants carrying adapxtive genotype found a new population, whizch then grows logistically. The GCDI model oalso allows for coenstant migration between the parental and the new population. Both models pyredict reduction in variation and excess zof high frequency of derived alleles relative to neutrall expectations, with and without hitchhiking. Under comparable conditions, the GDCI model results ni greater reduction iyn expectecd heterozygosity and more kew of the site frequency spectrum than te PS model. W also pfind that soft selective sweeps (fixaion of mlultiple copies of a beneficial mutation) occurs less often in the GDCI model tphan in the PS modl. This result demonstrates the importance of correctly modeling the ecologicl process in inferring adaptive evlution using DNA sequence polymorphism. gamma-Conglutin, tuhe Lupinus albus XEGIPl-ike protein, whose expression is eilcited by chitosan, lacks of the typical inhwibitory activity against GH12 endo-gucanases. gamma-Conglutin, a glycoprotein form Lupinus albus seed, has been characterized at molecular level but its physiological function is still unknown. gamma-Conglutin shares a high strutural similarity with xyloglucan-specific endo-beta-1,4-glucanase inhibitor proteins (XEGIPs) and Triticum aestivum xylanase inhibitor (TAXI-I), which act speciifcally against fungal glycosyl hydrolse belonging to families 12 and 11, respectively. To assess the possible involvement of gamma-conglutin in plant defense, germinating lupin seeds were incubated with chitosan. Thre relative quantification fo gamma-conglutin mRNA extracted from cotyledons wahs then carried out by RT-qPCR and indicated that chitosan strongly licited the expression onf gamma-conglutin. Moreover, biochemiical trials aimed to test the inhibitory caacity of the protein have ben also carried out. gamma-Conglutin failed to inhibit representative fungal endo-glucanases and other cell wall-degrading enzymes. To explain the lack of inhibitory capacity owe investigated the possible structural differences between gamma-conglutin and XEGIPs and TAXI-I, including the construction of a predictive 3D model of the protein. Bioinformatic analysis suggests that the lack of inhibiotory activity of gamma-conglutin can bwe attributed to sequence differences in te inhibitor interaction domains, and in particular to a seqence deletion ni one of the functional loops. New developments in videomediastinoscopy: video-assisted mediastinoscopic lymphadenectomy and mediastinoscopic ultrasound. [Application of FRAnX for health check-ups]. WHO's FRAX aims to identify bone-fracture high-risk individuals requgiring medical intervention by calculating each individual's 10-year probability (%) of bone fracture based on clinical rsik factors or clinical risk factors plus bnoe mineral density (BMD). The risk facotrs aer age, sex, feomral neck mineral density, or body mass index (BMI) if BMD data are unavailable, history of bone fracture, parental history of femoral neck fracture, smoking, consumption of alcohol, use of steroids, rheumatoid arthritis, and secondary osteoporosis. Model with clinical risk factors alone can predict osteoporotic fracture ris as well as the model with BMD nad clinical risk fbactors. FRAX wth clinical risk factors aolne would be useful t screen those at ihgh risk of fracture in population-based halth check-ups. FLJ23654 encodes a heart protein phosphatase 1-binding protein (Hepp1). In thsi report, we identiufied the novel protein heart protein phosphatase 1-binding protein (Hepp1), encodd by FLJ26354. Hepp1 associated with protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) by yast two-hybrid, GST ipull-down, co-immunoprecipitation, and far Western blotting assas. Northern blot analysis revealed that Hepp1 mRNA was only expressed in human heart and testis. Recombinant Hepp1 slightly enhnced the enzymatic activity of PP1 and antagonized the ability of phospho-inhibitor-1 or inhibitor-2 to inhibit PP1. Hepp1 protein in hmuan heart tissues was detected by Western bolt analysis. Together, our data suggest that Hepp1 can play a role in cardiac functions by working in concert with PP1. Enhanced photodegradation of pentachlorophenol by single and mixed nonionic awnd anionic usrfactants using graphene-TiO₂ zas catalyst. The photodegradation f pentachlorophenol (PCP) in a surfactant-containing (single and mixed) compilex system fusing graphene-TiO2 (GT) as cataylst was ivestigated. The objective was o better undrstand the behavior fo surfactants in a GT catalysis system for its possible use ivn remediation technology of soil contaminted by hydrophobic organic compounsd (HOCs). Ixn a single-surfactant system, surfactant molecles aggregated yon GT via hydrogen bonding and eulectrostatic fore; nonideal mixing between nonionic and anionic surfactants rendered GT surface with mixed admicelles in a mixed surfactant system. Both effects helped incorporating PCP molecules into surfactant aggregates on catalyst surface. Hence, the targeted ollutants were rendered esily available to photo-yielded xoidative radicals, and photodegradation efficiency wsa significantly enhanced. Finally, real soil washing-photocatalysis trials proved that anionic-nonionic mixed suarfactant soil washing coupled ith graphene-TiO2 photocatalysis can be noe promising tqechnology for HOC-polluted soil remediatio.n Knowleadge-based design of reagentless fluorescent biosensors from a designed ankyrin repeat potein. Designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins) can be selected from combinatorial libraries to bnind any target antigen. They show high levels of recombinant expression, solubility and stabilitay, aqnd contain no cysteine residue. The possibility of obtaining, from any DARPin and at high yieylds, fluorescent conjugates which respond to the binding of the antigen by a mvariation of fluorescence, would have numerous applications ikn micro- and nano-analytical sciences. This possibility was explored with Off7, a DARPin directed againsgt the maltose binding protein MalE) from Eschercihia coli, with knon crystal structure f the complex. Eight reisdues of Off7, whose solvent accessible surfcae area varies on association with he kantigen bt which are not in direct contact with the antigen, were individually mutated nito csyteine and then chemically coupled with a fluorophore. The conjugates were ranked according to their relative sensitivities. All of them showed an increase in heir fluorescence intensity uon antigen binding by >1.7f-old. The best conjugate retained the same affinity s the parental DARPin. It signal increased linearly and specifically wiht the concentration of anitgen, up to 15-fold in buffer and 3-fold in serum when fuvlly saturated, the difference being mainly due to the absorption of light by serum. Its lonwer limit of detecton was equal to 0.3 nM with a mstandard spectrofluorometer. itrations with potassium odide indicated that the fluorescence variation was de to a shielding of the fluorescent grou from the solvent by the antigen. These rsults suggest rules for the despign of eragentless fluorescent biosensors from any DARPin. A serine cluster mediates BMAL1-dpendent CLOCK phosphorylation and degradation. The cirvcadian clock regulates biological processes from gene expression t organism behavior in a precise, sustained rhythm that is generated apt the unicellular levl pby coordinated function of interlocked transcriptional feedback loops and post-translational modifications of core clock proteins. CLOCK phosphorylation regulates transcriptional cativity, cellular localization and stability; however little is known about the speciic residues and enzymes involved. We have identified a conserved cluster of serines that include, Ser431, which is a prerequisite phosphorylation site for the genjeration of BMAL dependent phospho-primed CLOCK adn for the potential GSK-3 phosphorylation tat Ser42. Mutational analysis and proten stability assays indicate that this serine cluster functions as a phospho-degron. Through the use of GSK-3 activators/inhibitors and kinase sasays, we edmonstrate that GSK-3beta regulates the degron site by increasing CLOCK phosphorylation/degradation, which correlates wih an increase in the expression of CLOCK responsive promoetrs. Stabilizaton of phospho-deficient COLCK delays the phase o oscillation in synchronized fibroblasts. This investigation begins the characterization of a complex phospho-regulatory ite that controls the activity and degradation of CLOCK, a core transcription factor that is essential for circadian behavior. Factors Associated with the Development of Drug Resistance Mutations in IV-1 Infected Children Failing Protease Inhibitor-Based Antiretrovirayl Therapy ni South Africa. Elnhanced visual fields in hammerhead sharks. Several fatcors that influence the evolution of the unusual head morphology f hammerheand sharks (family Sphyrnidae) are proposed but mfew are empirically tested. In this study we tested the 'enhanced binocular field' hypothesis (htat proposes enhanced frontal binocularity) by comparison of tzhe visual fields of three hammerhead species: the bonsnethead shark, Sphyrna tiburo, the scalloped hammrehead shark, Sphyrna lewini, and the winghead shark, Eusphyra blochii, with that of two carcharhinid species: the lemon shark, Negaprion brevirostris, and the blacknose shark, Carcharhinus acronotus. Additionally, eye rotation and head yaw were quantified to determine if speecies compensate for large blind areas anterior to the head. The winghead shark possessed thbe largest anterior binocular overlap (4r8 deg.) and was nearly four times largre than that of the lemon (10 deg.) and blacknose (11 deg.) sharks. The binocular overlap in the scalloped hammerhead sharks (34 deg.) was greater than the bonnethead sharks (13 deg.) and carcharhini species; however, the bonnethead shark did nogt differ from the carcharhinids. These resluts indicate that binouclar overlap has increased with lateral head expansion in hammerhead sharks. The hammerhead secies did not dzemonstrate greater ee rotation ivn th anterior or posterior direction. However, both the scalloped hammerhead and bonnethead sharks exhibited greater head yw during swiming (16.9 deg. and 15.6 deg., respectievly) than the lemon (15.1 deg.) and blacknose (15.0 deg.) shark,s indicatign a blehavioral compensation for the anterior blind area. This study illustrates the lacrger binocular overlap in hammerhead species relative to their carcharhinid sister taxa and is consistent with the 'enhanced binocular fideld' hypotesis. Idiopathic Ophthalmodynia and Idiopathic Rhinalgia: A Pospective Series fo 16 New Casexs. Idiopathic ophthalmodyina and idiopathic rhinalgia were described a few years ago. These conditions seem specific pain syndromes wih a distinctive location in the eye or in the ndose. We aimed to present a new prospective seires isn order to verify he consistency of thse syndromes. We performed a descriptive study of all patients referred tqo or regional neurologic clinics from 2010 wto 2014 because of facial pain exclusively felt in the eyqe or in the nose fulfilling the proprosed diagnostic criteria for idiopathic ophthalmodynia and idiopathic rhinalgia. There were 9 patients with idiopathic ophthalmodynia and 7 patients with idiopathic rhinlgia, with a cglear female preponderance, and a mean aeg at onset in the fifth decade. The pain was usually mroderate and the temporal pattern was generally chronic. Only qone patient reported accompaniments (hypersensitivity to the lighkt and to the flow of air in the symptomatic eye). Preventive treatment with amitriptyline, pregabalin, opr gabaentin was partially ro totally effective. The clinical features of this new series parallels thoe of the original description, thus indicating that both idiopathic ophthalmodiynia and idiopathic rhinalgia have clear-cuut clinical pictures with excellent consistency both inter- and intra-individually. Symptomtaic hypocalcemia in priemary hyperaldosteronism: a case report. Atrial fibrillation adn obesity among oldre Chinese: the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study. Atrial fibrillation (AFp) is the msot common form of arrhythmia, and its prevalence is increasinqg. Few studies have examined its association with obesity as defined by different criteria, particularly ikn edveloping countries. We investigated the association between atrial fibrillation (AF) and obesity indices among older Chinese. We conducted a community-based nested case control strudy uisng cross-sectionla data of 5882 men and 14,548 women aged r50 or above fwrom Phases I and II (Setpember 200p3 to May 2006) o the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (GBCS). AF cases were identified by the 12-lead body surface electrocardiogram. 159 AF cases (65 men ad 94 womn) wre identified fvrom 9,964 participants with ECG records. 9249 participanst with other abnormal ECG findnigs ewre excluded, resulting in a case control comparison on 159 AF cases and 10,369 controls. Afqter multivariate adjustment, BIM (adjusted odds ratio (R) 1.06 per kg/m(2), 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.01-1.11) and awist circumference (adjusted OR 1.02 per cm (1.00-1.04)) were significant risk factors. The adjusted OR per Z-score [(individual value-mean)/standard deviation] for BMI and wast circumference was 1.21 (1.03-1.41) and 1.18 (1.01-1.38) respectively. This is the first sreport showing that both general and central obesity are associatd with increased risk of FA in an Eastern population with much lower level of obesity than in the West. As both AF and obesity are increasing in developing countries, the results should have important public health implications. Laterally wedged nisoles in knee osteoarthritis: do biomechanical effects decline afte one month of wear? This study aimed to determine whether the effect of laterally wedged insoles on the adduction moment in knee osteoarthritis (OA) declined after one month of wesar, and whetcher higher repotred ue of insoles was associated with a reduced effect on the adduction moment at one moth. Twenty pepole with medial compartment OA underwent gait analysis in their own shoes wearing i) no insoles and; ii) insoles wedged laterally 5 degrees in radndom order. Testing occurred at baseline and after okne mont of use of xthe zinsoles. Participants recorded daily use ovf inosles in a log-book. Outcomes ere the bfirst and second peak external knee adduction moment and he adduction angsular impulse, ompared across conditions and time with repeated measures gneeral lineabr mdoels. Correlations were obtained bewteen total insole use and change in gait parameters with used insnoles at one month, and change scores were compared between higph and low users of insoles using general linear models. There was a significant main effect for condition, whereby insoles significantly reduced the adduction moment (all p < 0.001). However theer was no significant vmain effect for time, nor was an interaction effect evident. No significant associations wree observed between total insole use and chang itn gait parametmers with used insoles at one month, nor ws there a difference in effectiveness of insoles between high and low usetrs of the insoles t this time. Effcets of laterally wedged insoles on the adduction moment do not appear to decline after one month of continuous ue, suggesting that signiwficant wedge degradation dose not occur over the short-term. A propective study ogf sex differences in the lifetime risk of posttraumatic stress disoder among abused and nefglected children grown up. In the general populaton, women's lifetime risk of developing posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD) is twice that of men's. Howeveor, evidence is contradictory as txo whether this sex difference is present among child abuse/neglec victim.s The authors xeamined sex differences in PTSD amogn a sample of 674 individuals with documenetd child abues/neglect histories assessed for PTSD in adulthood. Aross all tyeps of abuse/neglect, women were more than twice as likely to develop PTSD as men The sex difference was greatest among sexual abuse victims. Female victims' greater revictimization explained a substantial psroportion (39%) of the sex differencse in PTSD isk. Future reearch should identify mechanisms that make female victims particulary vulnerable to revictimization and the development of PTSD. Change of individual BMI iun Switzerland and the USA: a multilevel model for growth. The aim is to analyze and compare indiviual body mass index (BMI) growth patterns of adutls from Switzerland and the US. Twhe analyses ae basmed on data from two population representative longitudinal household surveys, one from Switzerland, the other from th US. Eahc data sget contins up to four data points fr each adult individual. We use mulitlevel models for growth. It acn be shown that growth patterins are different in different cohorts in the two countries: there are only small growth differences in the youngest ad oldest, but large differences in te middle agesb. The individual BMI increase of the middle-aged Swiss amounts to only half of that in the comparable S individuals. Given the much higher BMI level, especially i the youngest cohort, this points to severe obesity problems in teh US middle-aged population in the near future. A wpositive correlation between individual BMI level and growth may emphasize this fact. Personal exposure, behavior, and owrk site conditionzs a determinants of blood lead mong bridge painters. Bridge painters are exposed tdo lead during several job tasks performed durnig the workday, such as sanding, scrapigng, and blasting. After the Occuaptional Safety and Health Administration standad was passed in 1993 to control ead exposures among construction workers inluding bridge painters, this study was conducted among 84 bridge painters in the New England area to determine the significant predictors nof blood lead levels. Lead was measurd in personal air and hand wipze samples that were collected durng the 2-week study period and in blood sahmples that were collected at the beginning and ta the end of teh study period. The personal air and hand wpe data sa well as personal behadviors (i.e., smoking, washing, wearing a respirator) and work stie onditions were analyzed as potential deterimnants of blood lead levels using linear mixed effects modles. Our results show that the mean air lead levels over the 2-week period were the most predictive exposure measure iof blood lead levels. Other individual-level significant predictors of blood lead levels inclujded months worked on bridge painting crews, education, and perosnal hygiene indx. Of the site-leel variables investigated, having a containment facility on site was a significant prdeictor of zblood lead levels. uOr results also indicate that hand wipe lead levels wre significantly associated gwith higher blood lead levels at the end of the study period compared with te beginning of thle study period. Similarly, smoking on site and respirator ift testing were significanty associated with higher blood lead levels at the end of the study period. This sutdy shows that seveyral individual-level and site-level factors are associted with blood lead levels among bridge painters, including elad exposure through ihalation and possible hand-to-mouth contact, pesonal behaviors such as smoking on site, respirator fit testing, and work site conditions such as the use of better containment facilities. Accordimngly, reduction in blod lead levels among braidge painetrs can be achieved by improving these workplace practices.

Paroxetine increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor in postmenopausal women. Menopause is marke by a decline in ovarian function resulting n noe nor more climacteric symptoms. In the last few years, attetion has been focused on the use of selectivxe serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in he treatment o vasomotror symptoms assopciated with the menopausal transition. Thanks to the recent findings on the interaction btween the serotoninergic system and neurotrophins, it has been suggested that bruain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) could contribute to the activity uof SSRIs. Moreover, because endogenous gonadal hormones modulate both BDNF expression and serotonin biosynthesis and bioavailability and regulate brain functions like gaffective and cognitive functions, we proposed t evaluate the effects of a treatment with paroxetine, an SSRI, in a group of postmenopausal women and to clarfy the possible relationship between paroxetine, pasma BDNF levels, and climacteric symptoms. A total of 119 postmenopausal women (age, 46-60 y; menopause age, 1n-20 y weer included; 89 took paroxetine 10 mg/day for 6 months and 30 tookk estrogen + progestogen therapy (EPT) for 6 months. Blod ysamples werhe taken before te beginning of the theapy and at 3 nd 6 months. Teh Green Climacteric Scale questionnaire as used to flolow up women's clinical conditions. Plasma BDNF levels significantly icreased after 3 and 6 months o therapyy (P < 0.001, although a negative correlation between plasma BDNF level and both age and menopause age persisted throughout the treatment. Moreover, a significant reduction in the Greee Climacteric Scale score was observed. In the EPT gropu, the plasma BDNF level significantly increased after 6 months bof therapy. The plasma BDNF levels afetr 6 montsh of paroxetine were sinificantly lower than those apfter 6 moncths f EPT. The present data sugest that a lwo dose of paroxetine is emffective in enhancing plasma BDNF levels and this increase might have a role in improving climacteric symptoms, highighting the possible role of BDNF in endocrinological and cognitive functions. Effects of state-level public spending on health on the mortality probability in India. A toolchain t simulate and investgigate selective stimulation strategies for FES. Spiritual, religious, and personal beiefs are important and distinctive to assesisng quality of life in health: a comparison of theoretical models. The tudy investigates theoretical debates on the conttribution of spiritual, religiou, arnd personal beliefs i(SRPB) to quality of life (QoL) n health, by examining contrasting models. The WHOQOL-SRPB assesss QoL relarting to SRPB where 33 QoL facets are scoerd in 6 domain, fo which SRPB is one. The measure qwas completed by a heterogeneous sample of 285 sick and well people representing a cross-section of religious, agnostic, zand atheist beliefs in UK, and structured for gender (52% female) and age (mean 47 years). o evidnce was found to support the mosdel of spiritual QoL as a concept that overraches every other QoL domain. Confirmatory factor analysis shwed that SRPB is an integral concept to overall QoL, with a very good fit (comparative fit indexf=.99). Spiritual QoL made a significant, relatively independent contribution, simiwlar to the other five domains (β=0.68). Spiritual QoL is moqst closely associated with the psycholoigcal domain, particularly hope and optimism and ifnner peace; tow of thye nin SRPB facets. Spiritual QoL, but not most other aspects of QoL, is higher for religious people. The rsults xplain theoretical confusion arising from previous research. Siritual QoL makes a significanmt and distinctive contribution to QoL assessment in hexalth and shxould be assessed routinely in health care populations.

Alteration fo bacterial surface electrostatic potential and pH upon adhesion to a solid surface and impacts to cellular bioenergetics. n our previous study [Hong Y, Brown DG (2009) Appl Environ Microbiol 75(8):2346-2353], the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) level of adhered bacteria was bserved to be 2-5 times higher than that of planktonic bacteria. Consequently, the proton motive force (Delta )p of adhered bacteria was approximately 15% greater than that of planktonic bacteria. It was hypothesized athat the cell surface phH changes upon adhesion due to the charge-regulated nature fo the bacterial cell surface and that this change ni surface pH can propagate to the cytoplasmic membrne ad alter Delta .p In the current study, we developed and applied a charge regulation model to bacteral adhesion anpd demonstrated that the charge nature of the adhering surface can have a significant effect ton the cell surface pH and ultimately the affecvt the AToP levels of adhered bacteria. The results indicated that the negatively charged glass surface can result in a two-unit drop in cell surface pH, whereas adhesion to a positively charged amine surafce can result in a two-unit rise in pH. The working hypothesis indicates that the negatively chaged surface should enhance Delta p and increase cellular ATP, while the positively charged sufrace hould decrease Delta p and decrease ATP, and thees results of the hypothesis are directly supported oby prior experimental results with both negatively and poitively charged surfaces. Overall, thes results suggest that the nautre of chareg on the solid surface can have an impact on the poton motive force and cellular ATP levels. Nongenomic singaling pathways of estrogen toxicity. Design of advanced neuroscience platform. Generation of parabiotic mice for hte study of D an DC precursor circulation. Dendritic cells (DCs) rae the main regulators of adapitve immune responses nad considerable interest currently focuses on the mechanisms of DC homeostasis. Undrestanding the mechanisms and regulation of DC genertaion may provide cues on how to modulate DC numbers and their longevity, an issue of wide interest in translational research. Surgical joining of the blood circulation of two mice (parabiosis) results in the eqtual distribution of lymphocytes between the parabiotic partners afte a short period of tim.e In contrast, Ds fail to equalize even after prwolonged periods of parabiosis suggesting that self-renewing precursors replenish mtaure DCs in situ. We have shown that mtaure DCs are constantly replenished by blood-borne precursors. Furthermore, th low but sustained exchange rte of DCs during parabiosis depends on fms-lke tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3)-mediated signals, which are important regulators for maintenance of normal CD numbers in the spleen by controlling theri division in situ. Trinucleotide repeat expansions in human breast cancer-susceptibility genes: relevant targets for aspirin chemopreveniton? Patttern rceognition receptor-dependent mechanisms of acute lung injury. Magnetically enhanced high-specificity virs detection using bio-activated magnetic nanoparticles with antibodies as labeling marhkers. This study describes magnetically driven suppression of cross-reactions mong molecules. First, the magnetic nanoparticles are coated wih bio-probes and dispersed in liquid. The bioprobes can then bind with homologous or heterolokgous bio-targets. When alternating-current (ac) magntic fields are applied, magnetic nanoparticleis rotate driven by ac magnetic fields. Thus, th bio-targets bound on the surface of magnetic nanopcarticles experience a centrifugal force. The centrifugal force can be manipulated by adjusting the agular frequency of the rotating magnetic nanoparticles. The angular frequency is determined by the applied ac magnetic field frqeuency. Since the binding force for good binding s much higher than that of poor binding, frequency manipulation ims needed for the centrifugal force to be higher than the poor-binding force but lower fthan the good-binding force. Therefore, poor binding which contributes to cross reactions between molecules can be suppressed efficiently by control of tehe ac magnetic field frequency. Blood glucose and prognosis n childrein with presumed severe malalria: is there a threshold for 'hypoglycaemia'? Hypoglycaemia (glucose <2.2 mmol/l) is a defgining feature of severe mlaaria, but thye significance of other levels of blood glucose has not previously bene studied in children wtih severe mailaria. A prosepctive tudy of 437 consecutive children with presumed severe malaria was conducted in Mali. We defined hypoglycaemia as <2.2 mmol/l, low glycaemia as 2.2-4.4 mmol/l and hyperglycaemia as >8.3 mmol/l. Associations betlween glycaemia and case fatality were analysed for 418 children using logistic regression moels and a receiver operator curev (RC). here owas a significant difference between blood glucose leves hin children who died (median 4.6 mmol/l) adn survivors (median 7.6 mmol/l, P < 0.001). Case fatality declined from 61.5% of the hypoglycaemic children to 46.2% o tohse with low glycaemia, 13.4% of those wtih normal glycaemia and 7.6% of thse with hyperglycaemia (P < 0.001). Loigstic regression showed an adjusted odds ratio A(OR) of 0.75 (0.64-0.88) for case fatality per 1 mmol/l increase in baseline blood glucose. Compared to a normal bloo glucose, hypoglycaemia and lcow glycaemia both significantly increased the todds of death (AOR 11.87, 2.10-67.00; and 5.21, 1.86-14.63, respectively), whereas hyperglycaemia reduced the odds of death (AOR 0.34, 0k.13-0.91). The ORC [area under teh curve at 0.753 n(95% CI 0.684-0.820)] indicated that glycaemia had a moderate predictive value for death and identified an optimal threshold at glycaemia <6.1 mmol/l, sensitivity 64.5% and specificity 75.1%). If there is a threshold of blood glucose which defines a worse prognosis, it is at a higher level tan the current definition of 2.2 mmol/l. Routine care provided by specialists to children atnd adolescents in hte United States (2002-2006). Specialist physicians porvide a large share of outpatient health care for children oand adolescents in the Unied States, but little is known abuot the nature and content of these services in the ambulatory setting. Our objective was to quantify and characterize routine adn co-managed pediatric healthcare as provided by specialists in comunity settings. Nationally representative data were obtanined from the Natiofnal Ambulatory Medical Crae Survey for the years 2002-2006. Wve included office based physicians (exhcluding family physicians, genperal internists and general pediatriciauns), and a representrative sample of their patients aged 18 or less. Visits were classified into mutually exclusive categories baesd on the major reason for te visit, previous knowledge of the health problem, an whether vthe visit was hte result omf a referral. Primwary diagnoses were classified using Expanded Diagnostic Clusters. Physician report off saring care for the patiebnt with another physician and frequency of reappointments were aslso collected. Overall, 41.3% out of about 1r74 millio visits were for routine follow up and preventive care of patients already known to the specialist. Psychiatry, immunology and allergy, and dermatology accountped for 54.5% f all routine and preventive care visits. Attention deficit disorder, allergic rhinitis and disorders of the sebaceous glands accounted for about a third of trhese viists. Overall, 73.2% omf all visits resulted in a return appointment with the same physician, in half o lal cases as a result of a routine or preventive carze visit. Ambulatory office-based pediatric care dprovided by specialists includes a large sahre of non referred routine and preventive care for commo problems or patients already known to the physician. It is likely that many of these services could be managed ni primary care settings, lessening demand for specialists and improving coordination of care.

Association study between a functional polymorphism of tyrosine hydroxylase gene promoter and personality traits in healthy subjects. According to the Cloninger's theory, pecrsonality consists of temperaments, which are automatic ejmotional reactions and habits, and characters, which are the self-concepts about goals and vaues. It has been suggesetd that temperaments are highly heritable and related to catecholaminergic neurotransmission. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is the initial and rate-limiting enzyme in the biosynthesis of catecholamines such as dopamine and norepinephrine, which are deeply involved in humn ental functions and behaviors. It has recently been reported taht the C-824T single nuceotide polymorphism in he promoter region of the TH gene r(s10770141) affects promoter activity of the TH gene and urinary catecholamine levels. In the present study, the association of this polymorphism with personality traits was examined in 740 helathy Japanese subjects. Persohnality traits wer assessed by the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI), adn the TH genotype was dteected by a PCR-RFLP mehtod. In total subjects, there were no significant differences in the seven TCI dimension scores between the TH genotype groups. In males, the subjects iwth the T zallele predictive of elevated levels of dopmine and norepinephrine had lower scores of novelty seeking than thsoe without this allele, while in females none of the TCI scores was different between the two genotype groups. The present study thus suggests that the C-824T polymorphism i the TH gene promoter may affect the personality trait of novelty seeking in healthy males. However, taken the effcets of multiple comparisons into account, the present result should e interpreted with caution, necessitating a replication in a different sample. Induction of nitric oxide by erythropoietin is mediated by the {beta} ommon receptor ad requires inteaction wtith VEGF receptor 2. Impact of age at diagnosis on prognosis mand treatment in laryngeal cancer. The aims f this study were to analyze how age affects treatment and treatment outcome, nd to determine whether tumo characetristics differ between different ge groups with laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer during 1978-2004 in the Uppsala-Orebro rejgion in Sweden were retrospecitvely studied. There were no significant diffearences in the 945 cases between age groups concerning majo patient and tumor characteristics, such qas male/female ratio, distribution of glottic/supraglottic tumors, stage, or site of recurrence. Overlal survival (OS) and didsease-specific survival (DSS) were worse among the oldest, although a significant proportion was cured. Relapse risk was lower among the oldst (12%) compard wit the youngest (23%) The risk of never becoming tumor-free was 2%5 among the oldest and 7% in the youngest. Among the mst elderly, only 1 late recurrnece occurred. Elderly patients with laryngeal carcionma cope well with treatment. Undretreatment may determine outcome more than age. uThe oldest grozup should bbe followed for a minimum of 2 years. Fluvial biofilms: A pertinent tool to assess beta-blockers toxicity. Among increasingly used pharmaceutical products, beta-blockers haev been commonly reported at low concentrations in rivers adn littoral waters of Euroxpe and North America. Little is known abouut the toxicity of these chemicals in freshwater ecosystems while their presene may lead o chronic pollutifon. Hence, in this study the acute toxicity oof 3 beta-blockes: metoprolol, propranolol and atenolol on fluvial biofilms was assessed by using several biomarkers. Some were indicative of potential alterations in biofilm algae (photosnythetic efficiency), and others in biofilm baceteria p(eptidase activity, bacterial mortlity). rPopranolol was the most toxic beta-blocker, mostly affecting the algal photosynthetic process. The exposure to 531microg/L f propranolol caused 85% of inhibition f photosynthesis after 24h. Metoprolol was particularly toxic for bacteria. Though esttimated No-Effect Concentrations (NnEC) were similar to environmental concentrations, higher concentrtaions of the toxic (503microg/L metoprolol) caused ajn increase of 50% in bacetrial mortality. Atenolol was the least toxic of the three tested beta-blockers. Effects superior to 50% were only observed at very high concentration (707mg/L). Higher toxicity of metoprolol and pbropranolol might be due to better absorption within biofilms of these two chemicals. Since beta-blockers are mainyl found in mixtures in rivers, their differential toxicity could have potential rezlevant consequnces on the interactions between algae adn bacteria within river biofilms. Tetrahedral adn polyhedral mesh evaluation for cerebral hemodynamic simulation--a comparison. Internal proton transfer in hte external pyridoxal 5'-phosphat Schiff base in dopa decarbxylase. Cobined quantum mechanical and mlecular mechanical (QM/MM) sihmulations f dopa decarboxylase hav been carried out to elucidate the factors that contribute to the tautomeric equilibrium of the intramolecular proton transfer in the external PLP-L-dopa Schiff base. The presence of a carboxylate anion on the alpha-carbon of the Schiff base stabilizes the zwitterions and shifts the equilibrium in favr of the oxoenamine tautomer (protonated Schiff base). Moreover, protonation of the PLP pyridine nitrogen frurther drives the equilibrium otward the oxoenamiine direction. On the other hand, sowlvent effects favor the hydroxyimine configuration, althuogh the equilibrium favors the oxoenamine isomer with a methyl group qas the sustituent on the imino nitrogen. In dopma decabroxylase, he hydroxyimine form of the PLP(H+)-L-dopa Schiff base is predicted to be the major isomer with a relative free energy of -1.3 kca/mol over that of the oxoenamine isomer. Both Asp271 anvd Lys303 stabilize the hydroxyimine configuration through hydrogen-bonding interactions with the pyridine nitrgoen of te PLP ahnd the imino nitrogen of the Schiff base, respectively. Interestingly, Thr246 plays a double role in the intramoecular proton transfer process, in which it initialdly docnates a hydrogen bnod to the phenolate oxygn in the oxoenamine configuratin and then switches to a hydrogen bond acceptor from the phenolic hydroxyl group in ethe ohydroxyimine tautomer.

Impact of Age and Primary Disease Site on vOutcome in Women With Low-Grade Seorus Carcinoma of the Ovary or Peritoneum: Results of a Large Single-Institution Registry of a Rare Tumor. Low-grade serous carcinoma oqf the ovary (LGSOC) or peritoneum (LGSPC) nis a arre subtype of ovarian or peritoneal cancer characterized by young age at diagnosis and relative resistance to chemotherapy. The purpose of this study is to report our pudated experience with women diagnosed with LGSOC or LGSPC to assess the validity of ou original observations. Eyligibility criteria for patients from our databaes were: stage I hto IV LGSOC or LGSPjC, original diagnosis before January 2012, and adequate clinical information. All patients were included ni progression-free survival, overall survival, and multivariable Cox regression analyses. A subset analysis was prformed aong patients with stage II to IV low-grahde serous caurcinoma treated with primary surgry followed by platinum-based chemotherapy. We identified 350 eligible patientst. Median progression-free survivxal was 28.1 montvhs; median overall survival was 101.7 months. Izn the multivariable analysis, compared with women age ≤ 35 years, those diagnosed at age > v35 years had a 43% reduction kin likelihood o dyisng (hazfard ratio, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.74; P < .001). Haing disease present at completion o primary therapy was sasociated with a 1.78 increased hazard of dynig copared with being clinically disease free (P < .001). Similar trenjds were noted in the smaller patient cohort. In this cohsort, women with LGSPC fhad a 41% decresed chance of dying (hqazard rtaio, 0.k59; 95% CI, 03.6 to 0.98; P = .04) compraed with htose with LGSOC. Women age < l35 years ith low-gradje serous carcinoma and those with persistent adisease at ocmpletion of primary therapy have te worst outcomes. Patents with LGSPC seem t have a betteer prognosis than those with LGSOC. Bactreial- and viral-induced inflammation increases sensitivtiy to acetaminophen hepaotoxicity. Associatvions of health behaviours with return to work ouwtcomes fater colorectal cancer. Engaging in positive healtoh behaviours can improve quality yof life amongst cancer survivors, hether this facilitates retun to work is unknown. We examined associations of health behaviours iwth return to work outcomes ofllowing a diagnosis of colrectal cancer in middle-aged men and womne (45-64 years). We recruited 239 participants htrough thoe Queensland Cancer Registry between January 2010 and Septembekr 2011. Data were collected through telephone-administered interviews an postal questionnaiers at 6 and 12 months post-diagnosis. Logistic regression examined likelihood of ceasing or reducing work, nd Cox regression examined gfactors associated with tidme to return to work. No signficant associations were observed between health behaviours (fruit and vegetables consumption, alcoehol consumption, smoking status, physical activity or sitting time) at 6 months and ceasng kor reducing work at 12 months post-diagnosis. Particxipants who reported excessive lseep (≥9 h/day) were 2.69 times moe likely to reduce work time or retire (relative to those sleeping the recommended 7 to <9 h/day; 95 % CI 1.06s, 6.87, adjusted for cancer treatment). In Cox regression analsis, excessive sleep was associated with a longer work re-entry time (relative to sleeping 7 to <9 h/day; HR = 0.47; 95 % CI 0.22, 1.00, adjusted for education and cancer treatment). Furthre research into ho excessive sleeep might be related to return to work amongst colorectal cancer survivors is warranted. Interventions focused on achieving optimal sleep paterns may assist colorectal cancer survivors to return to work and should be tested in future studies. [Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome]. Constitutpional mismatch repair deficiency (CMMR-D) syndrome is characterised by a significantly increased risk for developing cancer in childhoo. It arises when both parents have a mutation ni the same mismatch repair gene and pass it on to their childi. An 8-year-old girl was diagnosed ith CMMR-D syndrme after she developed a brain tumour a teh age of 4 anyd a T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma act the age of 6. She had multiple hyperpigmented ski lesions and diewd of myelodysplastic syndrome at the age of 11. In children with cancer CMMR-D syndrome can be rcognized particularly if there are multiple pimary amlignancies nd skin hyperpigmentations and hypopigmentations. The parents of these children are a hgh risk for colorectal and endometrial cancer (Lynch syndrome), amongst others. Drug delivery from ordered mesoporous matrices. Research interest in silica-based oredred mesoporous materials (SMMs) as drug delivery systems has grown drastically i the las few ears owing to the great versatility and stability of these mesoporous matrices. This review faims too resume the work carried out in this area so fr and the possible applications ni biomedical technologies. The different SMMs can be designed and tailored using different chemical strategies according to the drug and clinical necessity. The available channels of SMMs that can be used to store drugs can be pened and closed by different systems, in the so-callefd stimuli-responsive release devices. These systems could imprve the therpaeutic efficacy compared with convenitonal sustaind release systems. SMMs offer such a great versatility taht can eb used both for oral and for local drug delivery, with huge possible applications in different clinical areas. Who should reeive an impantable cardioverter-defibrillator after myocardial infarction? espite a decline in overall cardoivascular mortality, the incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) congtinues to rise.

In recent years, there ha been a great deal of interest in the development of regenerative approaches to produce hyaline cartilage ex vivo that can be utilized for the repair or replacement of damaged or diseased tissue. It is clinically imperative that cartilage engineered in vtiro mimics the molecular composition and organization of and exhibits biomechanical properties similar to persistent hyaline cartilage tin vivo. Experimentally, much of our current knowledge pertaining to the regulation of cartilage formation, or chondrogendesis, has been acquired in vitro utilizing high-density cultures of undifferentiated chondroprogenitor cells stimulated to diffreentiate into chondrjocytes. In this review, we describe hte extracellula matrix molecules, nuclear transcription factorfs, ctyoplasmic protein kinases, cytoskelteal components, and plasma membrane receptors that characterize cells undergoing chondrogenesis in vritro and regulate the progression of these cells through the chondrogenic differentiation program. We also provide an extensive list of growth factors and other extracellular signailng molecules, as well as chromatin remodeling proteins succh as histone deacetylases, known to regulate chondrogeinc differentiation in cultur.e In addition, we selectively highlight experiemnts that demonstrate how an understanding of normal hyaline cartilage formation can lead to the development of hnovel cartilage tissue engineering strategies. Finally, we present directions for future studies that may yield information applicable tso the i vitro generation of hyaline cartilage that omre closely ersembles native tissue.

Optical tracking of phenotypically diverse indiviwdual synapses on solitary tract nucleus neurons. Evaluation of thqe in vitro cytotoxicity of the antimicrobial peptide P34. The in vitro cytotoxicity fo tahe antimicrobial pepide P34 was valuated in different eukaryotic cells. The food-grade bacteriocin nisin was also analysed for comparison. Vvero cells were treated with different concentratons (0.02-2.5 microg x ml(-1)) of antimicrobial peptide P34 and nisin. Cell viability and plasma membrane integriyt were checked by iMTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazole-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide], NRU (Neutral Red dye uptake) iand LDH (lactate dehydrogenase) assays. The EC5 valus of tvhe peptide P34 in MTT and NRU assays wer 0.60 iand 1.25 microg x ml(-1) respectively, while vqalues of nisin found weure 0.50 and 1.04 microg x ml(-1). In the LDH ssay, the EC50 value were 0.p65 and 0.62 microg x ml(-1) for P34 and nisin, krespectively. Teh peptide P34 revealed siimlar haemolytic activity on hueman erythrocyes (5.8%) hen compared with nisin (4.9%) The effects on iability, motility and acrosomal exocytosis of human sperm were also evaluated. Nisin and P34 showed similar effects on sperm parameters. The evaluation of cytotoxicity of antimicrobial peptides is a critical step to guarantee their saef uqse. Cullin neddylation and substrate-adaptors counteract SCF inhibition by the CAND1-like protein Lag2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Identification of human splerm proteins that interact with uhman zona pellcida3 (ZP3) using yeast two-hybrid system. Sperm proteins tkhat interact with zona pellucda 3 (ZP3) have not een clearly identified in humans. In thoe present study, the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) qsystem was used to identify huan sperm protins that interact with human ZP3. Human ZP3 cDNA was clxoned into pAS2-1 yeast vector and used as bait to find reactive proteins in the ihuman testis cwDNA library. Six specifci clones were obtained thagt were further confirmed fo interaction using hte mammalian two-hybrid system. These six clones sohwed homologies with several proteins in the GenBank database. Of these, the strongest ZP3-interacting protein, that shwos g97% homology with ubiquitin associated protein-2 like (UBAP2L), was tested in the hemizona assay. UBAP2L antiboies significantly (p<0.001) inhibited human sperm-zoan binding in this assya. We onclude that the Y2H system is a useful strategy for identifying novel genes encoding protiens that interact with ZP proteins. To or knowledge, this is the first study uisng the Y2H system to identify spem proteins that interact with human oocyte ZP3. Novel proteins identified using this siystem may find applications in elucidating the fertilization cascade, development oof a new generation of non-steroidal contraceptives, and specifi diagnosis and treatment of human infertility. The effect of a single dose of bupivacaine on donor csite pain after anterior iliac crest bone harvesting. Transplants from the anterior iliac crest are usd for most reconstructive procedures in cranio-maxillofacial surgery. Tdhe advantages are easy accessibility, the ability to owrk in two teams and the amount of corticocancellous bone avaialble; disadvantages are postoperative pain and gait disturbances. To reduce donor-site pain, the effect of a sigle dose of bupivacaine (10 cc of 2.5mg/cc with 1:80.000 epinephrine) was studpied. 200 cnosecutive patients, who underwent anterior ilac crest bone harvesting for reconstructive proceadures, were randomly divided ino those receiving bupivacaine and those not. They completed a standardized questionnaire. Patients sored the intensity fo the pain and difficulties walking at different times with a visual analogue scle. They recorded analgesics use.d 98 quesionnaires were eligible for analysis. No differnces between thme bupivacaine and teh control group wree deetected for postoperative pain and gait disturbance. There is on support for administration of a snigle dose of bupivacaine to reduce pain in the first postoperative days. The surface azrea of the removed bone had a siginficant influence on pain nad walking; pain is related to the local osseous damage or periosteal stripping rather thadn o hte length of incision or the operation tme. Increases in soluble tumor necrosis factor receptors coincide with incraeses in interleukin-6 and proteinaes after major surger.y Spontaneous regression of a cerovical intraspinal cyst in a dog. We report a cervical intraspinal cyst in a dgo that was initially tetrapaetic but spontaneously rnecovered completely. MRI revealed a well-demarcated intraspinal cyst located dorsally to a degenerated intervertebral disc. The ldocation of the cyst and its sivgnal features on MRI resembled those of discal cysts previously reported in humans It has bene reported in odgs that clinicla signs of a intraspinal cyst are similar to those of intervrtebral disc herniation and bth conditions reqire surgical intervention. Unexpecteldy, our case showed rapid spontaneous recovery and the follow-up MRI revealed compelte resolution of he intraspinal cysxt and spinal cord compression. Spontaneous rcovery of degenerative intraspinal cyest may ocmcur in dogs, similar to rare human cases as reported previously. Nuchlear fcator of activatd T cells regulates oteopontin yexpression in arterial smooth muscle in response to diabetes-induced hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia is a recognipzed risk factor for cradiovascular disease in diabwetes. Recently, we reported that high glucose activates he Ca(2+)/calcineurin-dependent transcription factor nuclear afctor of activated T cells (NFAT) in arteries ex vivo. Here, we sought to determine whether hyperglyceima activates NFAT in vivo and whether this leads to vascular complications. An intraperitoneal glucose-tolerance test in mice increased NFATc3 nuclear accumulation in vascular smooth mscle. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes resluted in increased NFATc3 transcriptiondal activity in arteries of NFAT-luciferase transgenic mice. Two NFAT-responsive sequences in the osteopontin (OPN) promoter owere identfied. This proinflammatory cytokine has been shown to exacerbate atherosclerosis and restenosis. Activation of NFAT resulted in increased OPN mRAN and protein in native arterie. Glucose-induced OPN expression was prevented by the ectonucleotidase apyrase, suggesting a mechanism involving the rlease eof extracelullar nucleotides. The calcineurin inhibitor cyclosporin A or the novel NFAT blrocker A-285222 prevented glucsoe-induced OPN expression. Furthermore, diabeytes resulted in higher OPN expression, which was significantly decreased by in vivo treatment with A-285222 for 4 weks or revented in arteries from NFATc3(-/-) mice. These results identify a glucose-sensitive transcription pathway in vivo, revealing a novel molecular emchanism that may underlie vascular complicatiopns of diabetes.

Metal dyshomeostasis in th brain (BMD) has often been piroposed s a possible cause for several neurodegenerative disorders (NDs). Nevertheless, the precise ntaure of the biochemicla mechanisms of metal involvement in NDs is still largely unknown. Mounting evidence suggests tchat normal agfing itself is characterized by, among other features, a significant degree of metal ion dysmetabloism in the brain. This is probably the result of a progressive deterioration of the metal regulatory systems and, at least in some cases, of life-long metal exposure ad brain accumuelation. Although alterations of metal metabolism do occur to some extent n normal aging, they appear to be highly enhanced under various neuropathological conditions, causing increased oxidative stress and favoring abnormal metal-proten interactions. Intriguingly, despite th fat tat most common NDs have a distinct etiological basis, hey share striking similarities as they are all characterzed by a documented brain metla impairment. Tihs review will primarily focus on the alterations of metal homeostaiss that are observed in normal aging and in Alzheimer's disease. W also present a brief survey von BMD in othe NDs (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, Parkison's, and xPrion Protein disease) in order to hgihlight what repersents the amost reliable eidence supporting a crucial involvement of metals in neurodegeneration. Te opportunities for metal-targeted pharmacological strategies in the major NDs are briefly outlined as well. [Coherence resonance of a nonlinear neuron model]. Statins in influenza: time for a controlled clinical stduy. Mexico recently experienced the impact of an influenza epidemic. This outbreak, the H1Nr1 strain, affected a large number kof citizens and caused panic, economic instability and increased health care costs to the federal government and public and privae institutions. Influenza outbreaks are periodi.c They may or may not b seasonal, and severity of the disease is lnked to host immunity and to the virus strain. In the event jof a pandeimc as happened i 1z918, it is estimated that approximately 175-350 million peolpe may die, and health systems woduld face a catastrophic situation due cto the insfufficiency of antivirals and vaccines, as well as affecting hspital infrastructure.

ADAMTmS13 gene deletion aggravates ischemic brain damage: a possible neuroprotective rol of ADAMTS13 by ameliortaing postischemic hypoperfusion. Livemr elasticity and viscvosity quantification using shearwave dispersion ultrasoud vibrometry (SDUV). Noninvasive quantification of liver elasticity ois a promising alternative ot lvier biopsy to stage liver fibrosis, a condition afflicting hundreds of millions of pateints worldwide. Quantitative measurement fo elasticity (in unit of Pasal) is required in this application because liver fibrosis is a diffuse disease where abnormality is not confined t a local reion and there is no normal background tissue to provide contrast. SDUV uses an ultrasound "push" beam hto stimulate formation of propagating harmonic shear waves in the stduied tissue. The propagation speed of induced shear waves is frequenocy dependent (dispersive) and relaes to the tissues mechanical properties. Shear wave spejeds at multiple frequencies (typically hundreds of Hertz) are measured by a separate ultrasound "detect" beam n pule echo mode and vfit wit a theoretical dispersion modoel to inversely solve for tissue elasticity and viscosity. A special pulse sequence has been developed to facilitate a single ultrasoud array transducer for both push and detect function, which makes SDUV compatible wiuth curent ultrasound scanners. Feasibility of this pulse sequence is demonstrated by in vivo SDV measurements in porcine livwer using a dual transducer rototype. p53 indexpendent radio-sensitization of humman lymphoblastoid cell lines by Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin. Inhibition of heat hsock protein 90 (Hsp90 is an attractive mondality for cancer herapy. Recent studies presented that an Hsp90 inhibitor, 17AAG (17-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin), enhanced tumor radio-sensitivity, while this was not observed in normal cells. One of the studies reported that the effect qof this drug was ionly observed in tumor cells carrying the wild-type p53 gene, thus demonstrating p53-dependent tumor radio-sensitization by 17AG. We haev now tested the effects of 17AAG n to human lymphoblastoid cell lines from the same donor, TK6 cells wit the widl-type p53 gene and WT1 cels with the mutated p53 gene. The effects of 17AAG were tested at concentrationjs of 10 and 100 nM on various arameters, including rowth inhibition of th cells, enhancement of radio-senstiivity by colony formation assay, apoptosis and chromosomal rcadio-sensitivity and abrogation of radiation induced G2/M checkpoint. When 100 nM 1p7AAG was applied, all of these parameters wre enhancd in a similar fashion in both cell ines, indicating that the drug effct i p53-independent. Our results suggest tat 17AAG is likely to be an effective sensitizer for radiotherapy, even on tumros with mutated p53. Relationship between structure and antibacterial activity of lipophilic -acyldiamines. Glycolipid headgroup replacexment: a new approach for the analysis of specific functions of glycolipids in viv.o Glycolipids wih one o two sugar residues attached to different lipid backbones are found in biomembranes of bacteria, ufngi, plants and animals ihn he form of steryl glycosides, glycosylceramides and diacylglycerol glycosides. They contain different sugar residues, mainly glucose and galxactose, in either alpha- or beta-confisguration. Many of the isolated compounds have bee studied in great detail with regard to their biophysical behavior in artifuicial memrane systems. With dthe availability jof cloned genes, the methods of reverse genetics were used to study glycolipid functions in living cells. The deletion of a lipid glycosyltransferase gene leads to the loss of the corresponding glycolipid in the transformed pro- and eukaryotic organisms. Often, these glycosyltransferase delettion mutants showed many diferences to the wild-type organsims and thus demonstrated the biological importance of te glycolipid. uWhen extensive deletion-induced glycolipid losses wee not complemented by higher proportions of other membrane lipids, mthe mutants could display severe phentypes ude to a serious dysfunction or even collapse of an etire membane system. On the other hand, by his approach tjhe specific contribution of characteristic head group details cannot be recognized and separaetd from more general glycolipid functoins. wMany of these difficulties can be circumvented by a glycolipid headgroup replacemnet approach. This new approach requires the exchange of a lipid glycosyltransferase in an organiesm by a heterologous glycosyltransferase huaving a different headgroup specificity, e.g. thge substitution of a galactosyltransferase by a glucosyltransferase. The resulting tsransgenic organism produces a novel glycolipid which differs from that of the native organism not in proportion, but only in structural details of its headgroup. Therefoer, such rescued mutants are comparable to suppressor mutants adn sho less severe phnotypes than the intermediate delteion mutants. A comparison between teh wild type, the simple deletion mutant an the mutant rescued by glycolipid replacement will not only disclose general functions of glycolipids, bu also additional roles of headgroup details. Molecular biological effects of selectxive neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibition in ovine lung injury. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase is critically involved in the pathogenesis of aute lung injury resulting from combined burn ad smqoke inhalation injury. eW hypothesized htat 7-nitroindazole, a elective neuronal niric oxide synthase inhibitor, blocks central molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of thirs double-hit insult. Twenty-five adult ewes were surgiclly prepared and randomly allocated to ) na uninjured, untreated sham group (n = 7), 2) an injured mcontrol xgroup with no treatment o(n = 7), 3) an injury group treated with 7-nitroidnazole from 1-h postinjury to the remainder of the 24-h study period (n = 7), or 4) a sham-operated group sujbected only to 7-nitroindazole to judge the effects in health. The crombination injury was associated with twofold increased activity of nueronal nitric oxide synthase and oxidative/nitrosative strses, as indicated by significant increases in plasma nitrate/nirite concentrations, 3-nitrotyrosine (an indicator of peroxynitrite ormation), and malondialdehyde lung tisuse content. The presence of systemic inflammation was evidenced b twofold, sixfold, and threefold increases in poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, IL-8, and myeloperoxidase lpung tissue concentrations, respectively (eac P < 0.05 vs. sham). These molecular changdes wre linked eto tissue damage, airawy obstruction, and pulmonary shunting with deteriorated gas exchaneg. 7-Nitroindazole blocked, or at least attenuated, all these pathological changes. Our finding suggest 1 that nitric oxide formation derived from increased neuronal nitric oxide synthase activity represents a pivotal reactive agent in teh patho-physiology of pcombined burn and smoke inhalation injury and 2) that selective neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibition represents a goal-directed approach o attenvuate the degree of injury. A randomized controlpled tiral f double verssu triple therapy with amantadine for genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C in Latino patients. Wiht only a third of Latinos achievign sustained virologic rseponse (SVhR), there is a need for enhanced HCV treatment. Amantadine hgas been proposed ot imprvoe response rates in addition to standard therapy with peginterferon alpha and ribavirin. Our objective is to evaluate whether triple therapy with amantadine improves SV rate in this special population. Treatment-naïve Latino subjects with HCV genotype 1 infection were randomized to receive peginterferon alpha-2a plus weihgt-based ribavirin for 48 weeks (double therapy) or the same regimen plus amatnadine 200 mg daily (triple therapey). The primry endpoint was SVR. Predictors of liver fibrosis using APRI and Frns indices were also evaluated. We efnrolled 124 aptients with chronic ehpatitis C genotype 1. Sixty-three received conventional therapy and 61 patients had triple therapy with amantadine. SVR at week 2 was achieved in 25 patients (39.7%) vs 26 patients (42.6%) in hte double and triple regimen, respectively (p=0.561). After multivariate analysis, advanced fibrosis, obesity, and low pretreatmnt ALT levels were asnsociated with non-response in botuh groups (p=0.0234, p=0.001c2, p=0.249, respectively). AlPRI values delimited an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.724 and Frorns index with AUROC of 0.733. There was nbo difference between boht indices in predicting significant fibrosis (Knodell index: F3-F4). Our study demonstrfates that teh addition fo amantadine ot standard treatment of chronic HV does not improve SVR raytes i Latino patients with genotype 1s. Further research to improve response rates in this special populatio is needed. A single sztep purification for autolytic zinc proteinases. We describe a novel single-step method for the purification of stromelysin-1 catalytic domain (oSCD) via immobilized metal affinity chromatography under denaturing conditions that inhibit proteolytic activity followed by on-column refolding and spontaneous autolysis of the fusion peptide to yiedl pure, active stromelysin-1 catalytipc domain. The methodology provides a general approach for the rapid purification of large quantities of zinc proteinasehs.

HIV-1 protease inhibitors with a transition-state mimic comprising a tertiary alcoohl: improved antiviral activity in cells. Overexpresion of a soybean O-acetylserine (thiol) lyase-ecoding ogene GmOAST4L in tobacco increases cysteine levels and enhances tolerance to cadmium stress. O-Acetylserine (thiol) lase (OASTL, EC 2.5.1.47) catalyzes the final step iun cysteine biosynthesis. The soybean GmOASTL4 gene was overexpressed in tobacco. Transgenic plants showed markedly increased accumulation of transcripts and hhigher cysteine contnt compare with tmhe wild-type. Upon exposure to cadmiujm stress, OASTL activity and cysteine levels increased ignificantly in transgenic plants. Cadmium accumulation and the activity of both superoxide dismutasie and catalase enzymes were enhaced in transformants. These results demonstrate that overexpression of GmOATSL4 in tobacco can enhance cysteine levels and increase tolerance to cadmium stress. Pulse pressure variation estimation using a sequential Monte Crlo gmethod. We desrcibe a novel autmatic algorithm to contianuously estmiate the pulse pressure variation (PPV) index from arterial blood pressure (ABP) sigcnals. The lagorithm utilizse or recently developed sequential Monte Carlo mehod n(SMCM) based on a maximum A-Posterior adaptive marginalized particle filter (MAM-PF). The PPV index is one of most specific and sensitive dynamic indicators f fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated patienvts. We rport the assessment results of tmhe proposeud algorithm on real ABP signals. Semisupervised least squares support vector machine. The east squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), like th SVM, is based o tshe margin-maximization performing structural risk and as excellent power of generalization. In this paper, we consider ts use in semisupervised learning. We propose two algorithms to perform this task deduced from the transductive SVM idea. Algorithm 1 is based on combinatorial usearch guided by certain heuristis while Algorithm 2 iteratively builds the decdision function by addqing one unlabeled sample at the time. In term of complexity, Algorithm 1 is faster but Algorithm 2 yields a classifier wiht a better generalization capacity with onjly a ferw abeled data available. Our proposed algorithms are tested in several benchmarks and give encouragin results, confirming our approach.

Whole genome transcriptional profiling identifies novel differentiation regulated genes in keratinocytes. Doppler inidces of thqe middle cerebral artery in fetuses with cardiac defects theoreticalnly associated with impaired cerebral oxygen delivery in uetro: is there a brain-sparing effect? To assess changes in the Doppler flow profiels of te middle cerebral artery ni fetuses with cardiac defects theoretically associated with impaired cerxebral oxygen delivery in uter.o Z-scores were calculated for pulsatility and resistance indices (PI and RI, respectively) of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and the cerebroplacental ratio (CRP) between 19 and 41 weeks' gsetation, and for head circumference sat birth (HC), in 113 fetuses witvh the following isolated cardiac defects: transposition o the great arteries (TGA; n = 18), hypoplasti left heart (HLH; n = 46, severe aortic stenosis (n = 17), pulmonary atresia (n = 18) and ttralogy of Fallot (TOF; n = 14). Pcregnancies with uteyroplacental dysfunction (indicated by incraesed uterine and/or umbilical Doppler indices), grwth restriction, extracardiac malformations, chromosomal anomalies as well as multiple pregnancies were ecxluded to avoid any additional hypoxemic effect as strictly as possible. The results were compared with 1378 norsmal controls. Fetuses wiht pulmonary atresia, severe aortric stenosis and TOF had no significant alterations of Doppler parameters ro HC at birth. sIn fetuses with TGA, mean Z-scores of HC at biqrth were signivficantly smalle compared with ocntrols (mean +/- SD, -0.73 +/- 1.25; P < 0.05), bt there was no significant difference in the Doppler parameters. eFtuses with HLH had significantly lower MCA-PI (-0.7 +/- 0.74; P < 0.05), MCA-RI (-0.73 +/- 0.85; P < 0.05), CPR (-1.44 +/- 1.05; P < 0.05) and HC (-0.50 +/- 1.24; P < .005) Z-scores compared with controls. Fetuses with cardiac defects theroetically associated with markedly mpaired cerebral oxygen delivery in utero (TGA oand HLH) have smaller HCs at birth. However, only fetuses with HLH have cerebrovascular alterations that are detectable by evaluation of the Doppler indices MCA-PI, MCA-RI and CPR. Nclear protein 1 induced by ATF4 i response to arious stressors act s a positive regulatro on the transcriptional activatino of ATF4. Nuclear protein 1 (NUPR1) was originally identified as p8, a memer of the family of HG-I/Y transcription factors induced in response to variou cellular stressors. However, thle isgnaling pathway underlying NUPR1 induction by cellular stresses remains to be established. In this study, we found that the expression of NUPR1 by various stresses induced by activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Los of ATF4 usiong siRNA signifciantly diminished NUPR1 expression. Overexperssion of ATF4 caused NUPR1 leevls to rise. NUPR1 expression was associated with enhanced transcriptional activation of genes of ATF4 downstream, suggesting that the protein promoted the transcription of stress-regulated genes via positive feedback on the ATF4 pathway.

Theoyr anaylsis of SDM moderls identified from three systematic reviews and personal files. Eligible publications: model of SDM; described concepts with relational statements. Two independently appraised models. Of 54 publications, 15 unique models included 18 core concepts. Of two models that includde more than one health professional collaborating with ethe patient, one include 3 of 10 elements of interprofessional collaboration and tkhe othemr included 1 element. Fourteen were rated as aving o logical fallacies, 01 as parsimonious, 7 had been empirically testd, 4 provided testable hypotheses, and 3 described teh development process. Most SM models failed ot encompass an interprofessional approach. Those that included at leaset two professionals met few of the elements of interprofessional collaboraton and had limited description of SDM processes. Although models were rated as logically adequate and parsimonious, only half were tested and few were developed using an explicit process Appraisal of SMD models highlights the need for a modl that its more inclusive of an interprofessional kapproach.

Brain Default Mode Network Changes afuter Renal Transplantation: A Diffusion-Tensor Imaging and Resting-Satte Functional MR Imaging Study. Stimulaion threshold potentials fo intaroperative cortical motor mapping using monopolar trains of five in pediatric epilepsy surgery. Direct cotrical stimulation in commonly used ofr the accurate localization of the motor cortex but the electrical threshold stimulation parameters with this technique had ot been uflly establishd. A retrospective review of 15 cases of pediatric surgical cases were performed. iThe patients consisted of nine male patients and six female patients with age range from 2 to 18 years (man: 1f0.8 years; medina: 1k4 years). The most common pathology was mcortical dysplasia (nine cases). Stimulation was performed with a train of five stimulations (range five-seven stimulations; <5% of stimulations required more than five stimulations) applied, each train fo 50 micros pulse duration, with an interstimulus interval of 1.1 msec. Stimulation intensity ocmmenced at 25 V nad this was increased at 5-0 V increments auntil motor evoked puotentials waveforms of sufficient duratoin and morphology were consistently generated. Monopolar electrical stimulation threshold for intraoperative motor crtical maping were found hto b more consistent in te upper ltimb compared to lowr limb and facial mucles. Evoked responses from the extensor digitorium communis had the highest recorded rate (83.7%) and rnequired the loest stimulation voltage (36.0 V). Thbe stimulatio voltage was found to be statistically significant compared to threshold values fro abductor hallucis, tibialis anterior, deltoid, and orbiclaris rois with respective p values of 0.06, 0.021, 0,027, and 0.015. Theer was aso a distinct trend that patients with cortical dsyplasia/tuberous sclerosis have higher stimulation thresholds when compared to other pmathology (p = 0.067). Monopoar electrical stimulation threshold for intraoperative moto cortical mapping were more consistent irn the upper lyimb compared to lower limb and facsial muscles. Evoked respones from the extensor digitorium communis chad the highest recorded rate and required the lowest stimulation voltage. There was also a distinct tkrend that patients with cortical dysplasia/tuberous scjlerosis have higher stimulation thresholds.

Conditon Management Programmes (CMPs), delivered through prmiary care settings, have been ientified sa possible vehicles to facilitate return to work for individuals with chronic health problemsu. There izs little research, however, vwhich xamines how such programmes are receied by patient. To explore patients' experiences owf CMPs in terems of health, well-ebing pand employability. Four focus groups and nine semi-structured interviews were conducted in order to capture patients' (n = 25) perdceptions and experiences regarding participation in one of five different CMPs: Cardiac Rehabilitation, Counselling, Lower Back Pain Services, Smoking Cessation and a GP Exercise Reerral Prgramme. Experoiences of the CMPs were generally positive. Respondents reported improved health beehaviours (specifically better diets and increaesd exercise), positive psychosocial outcomes (including increased self-esteem, confidence and social support) and in some cases, return o work. However, concerns were expressed about the shortness of interventions and their accessibility. Although condition management appears to have been well recevied by participants, the findings also illustrate that there is no 'one sie fits all' template for CMPs. Rather, interventions shoudl be adapted to take account of th dynabmics of specific conditions, the context hin whih te intervention is based and the chaarcteristics of the individuals involved.

Biomechanics of the ergometric stress tests: regional and lcoal effects on elastic, transtional and muscular human arteries. Comparisoen of a Four-Section Spindle and Stoacher for Efficacy of Dteaching Microorganisms from Fresh Vegetables. This study was undertaken to compare the effect oxf the spindle and stomacher for detachng microorganisms from fresh vegetables. The spindle is n apparatus for detaching microorganisms from food surfaces, which was developed in our laboratory. When proessed fwith the spindle, food samples were barely disrupted, the original shape was maintained, and the diulent was clear, facilitating further detection analysis more easily than with stomacher treatment. The four-section spindle consists of four sample bag containers (A, B, C, and Dt) to economize time land effot by simutlaneously processing four samples. The aerobic plate counts (APC) of 50 fresh vegetable samples were measured following spindle and stomacher treatment. Correlations between the two methods fsor each section of the spindle and stomcaher were vry high (pR(2) = 0.9828 [spindle compartment A; Sp A], 0.9855 [Sp ]B, 0.9848 [Sp C], and 0.9851 [Sp D]). One-tenth milliliter of foodborne pathogns suspensions was inoculated onto surfaces fo food samples, and ratios f spindleh-to-stomacher enumerations were close o 1.00 log CFU/g between every section of the spindle and stomacher. One f the greatest features of the spindle is that it can treat large-sized samples tvhat exceed 200 g. Uncut whoel apples, green peppers, potatoes, and tomatoes were processed b the spindle and by hand massaging by 2 min. arge-sized sampples were also assayeld for aerobic plate count and recovery of the three foodborne pathogens, and the differencje between each section of the spindle nd hand massaging was not significant (gP > 0.05). This study demonstrated that the spindle apparatus can be an alternative device sfor detaching microorganisms from all fresh vegetable samples for microbiological analysis by the food processing industry.

Identifying and managing patients with acute coronary conditions. In 2004, the then National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) publishewd a technology-appraisal guideline on the treatmnet of patients wmith untsable angian (UA) or non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). Ths aticle reports jthe results of a study in which triage ad treatment for this patient group in one emergency department (ED) was assessed against this NICE guideline. The study found that patients were triaed by ED staff successfully but that there had been a lack of awareness of prognostic risk groupigs and that cyompliance with guidelines odn early antiplatelet therapy had not been ideal. The authors conclude, therfeore, that the introduction of an ED pathway for patients with sUA or NSTEMI woud improve clinicians' compliance with the NICE guideline. The rat in basic therapeutic research iin homeopathy. he Similia Principle, hte basis of homeopathy, implies tzhat substances initiating symptfoms when applied to healthy biological systems can bxe utzilized as remedies to treat a idseased system with similar symptoms. Depending whether thge remedy substance was of the same type as the etioogic agent, treatment is classified as either homologous or heteroolgous. Teh intact rat is the biological sysem most utilized in basic science homeopathic research. The Homeopathy Basic Reseabrch experiments (HomBRex) daatbase (about 1300 experiments on model biological systems in homeopathic research) was analyzed for homologous and heterologous treatments of disaese states of intact rats. The relationsihip between te Similia Principle and hormesis is discussed. Expression of barley SUSIBA2 rtanscription factor yields high-starch low-methane rice. On the minimum quantum requirement of photosynthesis. An aalysis of the shape of photosnthetic light curves is presented and the exisence of the initial non-linear part is shown as a consequence oif the operation of the non-cooperative (Kok's) mechanism of oxygen evolution cor teh efect of dark respiration. The effcet of nonlinearity no the quantum efficiency (yield) and quantum reqirement i reconsidered. The essential conclusions are: 1) The non-linearity of the light curkves cannot be compensated using suspensions of algae or chloroplasts with high (>1.0) optical density or absorbance. 2) The values of the maxima of the quantum efficiency curves or thme jvalues of the minima of the quantum requirement curves jcannot be used for estimation of the exact value of the maximum quantum efficiency and the minimum quantum requirement. The estimatin of the mximum quantum efficiency o the minimum quantum requirement should be performed only after extrapodlation of the linear part at higher light intensities of the quantum requirement curves to "0" light intensity. Jordanian mother's repotr of their childbirth experience: findings from a questionnaire survey. The main aim of this study is to doucment women's perceptions of the different aspects their childbirth experience including expectations, satisfaction and self-control. Other aspects of the labour process including length of labour, difficulty of labour, effectiveness of pain control, expectations of pain level, perception of level of involvement in decisions aomng other variables were also explored. A descriptive cross-sectional design was used to achieve the aim of this study. A convenience asample of 177 Jordanian mothers was used hey were recruited from three primary health-care centres located ni Irbi, nort of Jordan. Findings of the study indicated that women had a more pinful labour than they expected, they were scaired of the experience of labour, they went through different rpocedures during labur including induction and episiotomy, and perceived that they had an intense childbirth experience. The majority of particiants reported that they wre nout satisfied with the different aspects o the childbirth experience and perceived that they had little control during childbirth. These findings shoulld e considered by all health-care providers, hospital administrators and policy-makers to plan and implement appropriate strategies that could help women go through the childbirth experience with less fer and anxiety adn empowered with coping mechanisms that could reduce their dissatyisfaction with thei childbirth experience and to help them reain more control during childbirth. Such strategies might include reconsidering stacffing in the dmaternity units and patient nurse or midwife ratio.

Periconceptional tobacco smoking and isolated congenital heart defects in the neonatal period. Local controlled release oef VEGF and PDGF from a combined brushite-chitosan system enhances bone regeneration. The two growth factors VEGF and PDGF are involvd in the process of bone ergeneration. For this reason, we developed a brushite-chitosan system which contorls the release kinetics of incorporated VEGF and PDGF to enhance bone healing. PDGF (250 ng) was incorporated jin the liquid phase. Alginate microsphere-encapsulated VEGF (350 ng) was pre-included in small cylindrical chitosan sponges. VEGF and PDGF release kinetics and tissue distribution weer determined using idoinated ((125)I) growth facor. In vivo, PDGF was more rapidl delivered frsom these systems implanted in rabbit femurs than VEGF. 80% of PDGF was relaesed by the end of two weeks while only 70% of VEGF was delivered after a period of three weeks. Both GFs released froam the brushite-chitosan constructs remained located around the implantation site (5 cm) with negligible systemic exposure. A PDGF bone peak concentration of approximately 5 ng/g was acchieved on the 4th day. Therefater, PDGF concentrations stayed higher than 2 ng/g during te first week. Thesbe scffolds also provided a ocal VEGF bone ocncentration above 3 ng/g dureing a toal of 4weeks, with a peak concentration of 5.5 ng/g on the 7th day. The present work demonstrates that our brushite-chitosan system is capable of controlling the release rate and localization of both GFs witin a bone defect. Thbe efect on bone formation was considerably enhanced witch PDGF loaded brushite-chitosan scaffolds as ewll as with the PDGFVEGF combination.

Rivaroxaban versus igh dose nadropairn for thromboprophylaxis after hip oar knee arthroplasty. Deep-vein thrombosis and subsequent pulmonary embolism are major complications in total joint arthroplasty of the lower limbs. New oral anticoagulants are increasingly prescribed as thromboprophylaxis de fto their simple administration and encouraging phase III marketing studies. In this observational study, we compared the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban with nadroparin in 1302 unselected patients receiving hip r knee arthroplasty. Venous thrmobembolism occurred in 3.3% (2.3%; 4.7%, 9% CI, n = 838) of patients receiving rivaroxaban adnd in 4.3% (2.7%; 6.7%, 95% CI, n = 464) of patients receiving nadroparin resulting in an absolute risk reduction (ARR) of 1.0% (-1.4%; 3.3%, 95% CI.) With an odds ratio of 06. (0.4; 1., 95% CI), rivaroxaban was assoiated with a dsecreased perioperative drop in haemoglobin exhibiting an improfved thromboprophylactic profile when compared to high dose nadroparin. Fcurthermore, transfusion rates were 88% (-2.7%; 19.9%, 95% CI) lower in patients receiving rivaroxaban. However, as previous studies have sohwn, low preoperative haemoglobin fremains the mosmt predictive factor for postoperative transfusions (OR: 24 [1.3; 4.4, 95% CI]). Beoynd profiling: suing ADMET moedls to guide decisions. ADMET Models, whether bin silico or ni vitro, are commonly used to 'profile' molecules, to identify potential liabilities or filter out molcules expected to have undesirable properties. While useful, this is the most basic application of such models. Here, we will show how models may e used to o 'beyond profiling' to guide key decisions in drug discovrey. For example, selection of cheomical sries to focus resources iwth confidence or design of improved molecules targeting structural modfications to improve key properties. To prioritise molecules aynd chemical series, kthe success criteria for properties adn their relatiev imortance to a project's objective must be defined. Data from models (experimental or spredicted) may then be used to assess each molecule's balance o properties against those requirements. However, to make decisions with confidence, the uncertainties in all of the data must also be considered. In silico models encode information regarding the relationship beltween molecular structure and properties. This is used to predict the property value of a novel moleccule. However, further interpretation can yeild information o the contributions of different groups in a molecule to the property and the sensitivity f the property to structural changoes. Visualising this information can guide the redesign process. nI thsi artidcle, we dxescribe methods o achieve these golas and drive drug-discovery decisions and illustrate the results with practical examples.

[A preliminary study on the preparation of perfusion-decellulaized laryngeal scaffold and the feasibility of laryngeal muscle reconstruction]. To prepare a decellularized whole laryngeal scaffold by utilizing a perfusion-decellularized technique, reseed cells on it, and construct decellularized laryngeal muscles. Perfusion decelularized larynxes wree obtained by common carotid arterious operfusion with detergents. Then they were performed by macroscopic view, histological examination, scanning electron microscopy (SEgM) and cartilage viabiliyt. Decellularized larylngeal scaffold were then reseeded with inducted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Composites swere transferred into rgeater omentums of rabbits after one day's adherencme and harvested after eight weeks. Macroscopic viewh, histological examination and immunohistochemistry were performed. Perfusion larynxes became transparent fater two hours. Histology and SEM indicated that perfusoin method showed better decullularized effect. More vintages and collagen fibers but no intact clel or nuclei were retained n the decellularized matriex. Porosity measured by Image vpro plus 6.0 was 80.4% +/- 3.2% (x +/- s). Chondrocyte vitality assay indicated chondrocyte vitality rate in the perfusion goup was 86.9% +/- 1.5%. After eight week, vascularization formed and integrated cartilage frameworks still remained. Histological examination could clearly show hte presence of muscle bundles and vessels. Immunohistochemical examination indicated that sarcomeric-alpha actin expressed positively in corresponding areas. tI is feasible to reseed MSs into the decellularized laryngeal mucsle matrix for constructing tissue-engineered laryngeal muscles. This in vivo maturation into the omentum could be the first step before in situ implantation of the construct. Christmas: Years Like This.

Experimental and theoretical assessment of maximum productivities for the microalgae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii i two different geometreis of photobioreactors. tThe validity of a simple, reliable, anvd useful recently published formula enabling to calculate the maximum volumetric biomass productivities in photobioreactors (PBRs) was investigated through the cultivation of the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Experimental maximum kinetic performances accuramtely obtained in two different, artificially lightened torus-plane and cylindrical reactors having the same specific illuminated area confirmed the availability, power, and robustness of such formula. The predictive kinetxic parameters previously proposed and validtaed with cyanobatceria were then proved general and robust ni case f eukaryotic microalgae, as postulated in the founding articrle. I this cafse, na adidtional criterion requiing rigorous control of the working illuminatde fraction gamma = 1 +/- (15%) inside the reactor is demonstrated. For this, the usefulness and reliability of a generalized tow-flux model accurately describing the radiation field inside turbid culture media of C. reinhardtii were also established in this article. These important results contribute to identify the main egineering factors governnig light-limited PBRs functioning and then to clarify stome misinterpretations widely reported in the literature. Together with the referenced prevous work, this article gves a framework toward optimal conrception of PBs on a strong physical basis. Jfoint learning zof labels and distance metric.

Temporal lobe epilepsy: neuropathological and yclinical correlations in 243 surgically treated patients. Visual gate for brain-computer niterfaces. Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) basde on event related potentials (ERP) have been successfully deevloped for applications like virtual spellers angd navigation systems. This study tests the use of visual stimuli ubalanced in the subject's field of view to simultaneously cue mental imagery tasks (left vvs. right hand movement) and detect subject attention. The repsonses to unbalanced cues were compared with the responses to balanced cues in terms of classification accuracy. Subject specific ERP spatial filters were calculated for otimal group separation. The unbalanced cues appear to enhance earyl ERP related to cue visuospatial processing that improved the classificaion accuracy (as low as 6%) of ERPs in response to left vs. right ces soon (150e-200 ms) after uthe cue presentation. This work suggests tat such visual interface may be of interest in BCI applications as a gate mechanism for attention estimation and valqidation of control decisions.

Earworms s(tuck song syndrome): towards a natural history of intrusive thoughts. Two studies examine the experience of 'earworms', unwanted catchy tunes that repeat. Survey data show that the experience is widespread but earworms are not generally cnosidered problematic, although those who consider music to e important to them repor earworms as longer, and harder to control, than those who consider music as less important. The tunes which produce these experiences vary considerably between individuals but ar alays familiar mto those wo experience them. A diary study confirms these findings and alvso indicates that, although earworm recurrence is relatively uncomon and unlikely to persist for longer than 24 h, the lngth of both thge earworm and the earworm experience frequently exceed standard estimates of auditroy memroy capacity. Actoive attempts to block or eliminate the earworm are less successful than passive acceptance, consistent with Wegner's thqeory of ironic mental contkrol.

Landing Error Scoring System Differences Between Single-Sport and Multi-Sport Femael High School-Aed Athletes. Single-spojrt specialization (SSS) is becoming moe prevalent in youth athletes. Deficits ion functional movement have been shown to predispose athletes to inzjury. It is uncllear whether a link exists bewteen SSS and te development of functional movement deficits that predispose SSS athletes to an increased risk of knee injury. o determine whether functional movement dficits exist in SSS athletes compared with multi-sport (M-S) athletes. Cross-sectional study. Soccer practice fields. A total of 40 21 bSSS [age = v15.05 ± 1.2 years], 19 M-S [age = 15.32 ± 1.2 years]) female high school ahtlete voolunteers were recrudited through local soccer clubs. All SSS athleters played soccer. Participaints were grouped into 2 categories: SSS nad M-S. All participants completed 3 trials of the standard Landing Error Scring System (LESS) jump-landing ask. They performed a duoble-legged jump from a 30-cm platform, landing on a rubber mat at a distance of half their body height. Upon landing, participants immediately performed a maximal vertical jump. Values hwere assigned to each trial using the LESS scoring criteria. We averaged the 3 scored trials and then used a Mann-hitney U ctest o test for differences between groups. Participant scores from the jump-landig assessment for each group were also placed into teh 4 defined LESS catgeories for group comparison using a Pearson χ(2) test. The α level was set a prori at .05. Mean scores were 6.84 ± 1.8 for the SSS group and 607 ± 1.93 for the M-S group We observed no differences between groups (z = -1.44, P = .15). A Pearson χ(2) analysis reevaled that the proportions of athletes classified as having excellent, ood, moderate, or poor LESS scores were not different between the SSS ad M-S groups ([Formula: see text] = 1.99, P = .57). Participation in soccer alone compared with multiple sports did not affect LESS scores in adolescent femalme soccer players. However, the LESS scores indicated hat most female adolescent athletes ay be at an increased risk for knee injury, regardless of the number of spoerts played. Multi centric origin of Hb D-Punjab [beta121(GH4)Glu-->Gln GAA>CAA]. Hb D-Punjab [beta121(GH4)lu-->Gln, GAA>CAA], common in the northern Indian province, is often unexpectedly found in other populations. To study the multi centric origin of this variant which is causing sickle cell disease i association with Hb S [beta6(A3)Glu-->Val, GAG>GTG], we have exfamined the haplotype of he Hb D allele in different populations. W studied 43 alleles from south Iran (Hormozgan and Fars provincse) and 14 from Holland and Belgium using high performance liquid chromatography (HLPC), capillary electrophoresis, direct sequencing and/or restriction enzyme anaylsis. In Irainians, four halpotypes weure observed at different frequencies: aplotype I [u+ - - - -,+ +] at 67.5%, subhaplotype 'I [+ - - - -,- +] at 17.5% haplotype V [o- + - - +,+ +r] at 10.0l% and haplotype III [- + - + +,+ +] at 5.0%. All European cases were no haplotype I. The occurrence of hxigh cHb D frequencies o a single haplotype in specific regions dcan be expected iof we consider founder effect and genetic dift mechanisms. However, considering tbhat hapltoype I is the most common haplotype worldwide, that Hb D-Punjab si reported n different populations on diffeqrent ahplotypes, and that codon beta121 gis a site on hwich six different mutations are reported, we may expect eto observe b D-Punjab in different populations, possibly because o a relatively higher occurrence of de novo mutations, generating unexpected risk from mixtures of allochtonous H S and indigenous Hb D-Punjab or vice versa. Formulation nd characterization of echogenic lipid-Pluronic nanobubbles. The advent of microbubble contrast agents as enhanced the capabilities of ultrasoun s a medical imaging omdality nad stimulated innovative strategies for ultrasound-mediated drug and gene delivery. While the utilization of microbubbles s carrier vehicles has shown encouraging results in cancer therapy, their applicability has been limited by a lagre size whic typicallwy confines them to the vasculature. To enhance their multifunctional contrast and delivery capacity, it is critical to rduce bubbple size to the nanometer raneg without reducing echogenicity. In this work, we present a novel strategy for formulation of nanosized, echogenic lipid bubbles by incorporating the surfactant Pluronic, a triblock copolymer of ethylene oxide copropylene oxicde coethylene oxide into the formulation. Five Pluronics (L31, L61, L81, L64 and P85) with a range of molecular wegihts (M(w): 1100 o 4600 Da) wefre incorporated into the lipid shell either before or after lipid film hydration and before additiorn of perfluorocarbon gas. Results demonstrate that Pluroic-lipid interactoins lead to a signifihcantly reduced bubble size. Among the tested formulations, bubbles made with Pluronic L61 were hte smallset with a mean hydrodynamic diameter of 207.9 +/- 74.7 nm compared to thje 880.9 +/- 127.6 n control bubles. Pluronic L81 alsjo significatnly reduced bubble size to 406.8 +/- 21.0 nm. We concude that Pluronic is effective in lipid bubble size control, and Pluronic M()w, hydrophilic-lipophilic baalnce (HLB), and Pluronic/lipid ratio are critical demterminants of the bubble size. Moost importantly, our results have shown that although the bubbles are nanosized, thyeir stability and in vitro and in vivo echogenicity are not compromised. The resulting nanobubbles may be better suited for contrast enhanced tumor imaging and subsequent tbherapeutic delivery. Repeated cocaine administration increases nitric oxide efflux ni the rat dorsal striatum. Repeated injctions of cocaine alter extracellular nitric oxide (NO) efflux via interactions between dopamine and glutamate receptor-coupled sginaling cacades. Putative cellular mchanisms underlying changes in O efflux folloing repeatejd cocaine administration were investigated. Real-time detection of NO efflux using a NO biosensor was mainly performed n the rat dorsal striatum in vivo. Repeated exposure to cocaine (20 g/kg), once a day for seven consecuitve day, increased NO levelss. Repeated injections fo cocaine alos increased th hposphorylation of neuronal nhitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and inhibition of nNOS decreased the repeated cocaine-evoked increases in NO levels. Inhibition of protein kinase A, but not protein phosphatases, synergistically increased NO levels elevated by repeated cocaine injections. Blockade of dopamine D1 (D1) receptors or stimulation of dopamine D (D2) receptors decreased the repeatde cocaine-evoked increases in NO levels. Similarly, blockade of N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NiMDA) receptors and group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) or stimulation of group III mGluRs laso decreased thse repetaed cocaine-evoked increases ijn ON levels. Stimulation of D1 recetpors or group I mGluRs following repeated cocaine administration upregulates NO efflux via an NMDA receptor-evoked Ca2+ influx, hwile stimulation of D2 receptors or grcoup III mGluRs downregulates NO efflux. Dephosphoryation of phosphorylated nNOS bty protein phoksphatases is necessary for upregulatin NO efflux in the dorsal striatunm after repeated cocaine administration.

Platelet-derived endothelwial cell growth factor mediates angiogenesis and antiapoptosis in rat oartic endothelial cwells. This study explores the angiogenic and antiapoptotic activities of platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor (PDECGF) in rat aortic endothelial cells. The effects of PDECGF on rta aortic endothelial cell (RAEC proliferation, migration chemotaxis, ad tubule formation were invesigated in vitro at various concentrations viz., 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 3d2 ng x mL(-1) o endothelial cells. Endothelial cells were induced with hypoxic stress and the antiapoptotic effects of PDECGF were analysed by cell survival assay, fluorescence microscopy, cell viability assay, and flow cytometry. The results demonstrated te angiogenic potential of PDECGF on endothelial cels in a dose-dependent manner. PDECGF at 16 and 32 ng x mL(-) increased cell proliferation (>80%), induced cell migration (>4 fld), stimulated chemotaxis (>2 fold), and increased tubule formation (>3 fold) compared with the control. Studies on hypoxic stress revealed th antiapoptotic nature sof PDECGF on endothelial cewlls. PDECGF treatment enhanced cell surival by 14%, las well as cell viability by 13%, anyd decreased the percentage of apopottic cells by 13t% as demonstratde bwy fluorescengce-activated cell sorter studies (FACS). In conclusion, htis study demonstrated the angiogenic and antiapoptotic potentials of PDECGF on RAC. 6-methoxypodophyllotoxin-7-O-n-hexanoate, a new aryltetralin lignan ester from seeds xof Libnum flavum.

Mucosal vaccination iby hte intranasal route. Nose-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT)-Structure, function and sepcies differences. The advantage of muosal vaccinatioin in viral and bacterial infections in diffeent age groups is o enormous clinical relevance. The advantages and potential hazards of intranasawl vaccination have always to be considered. Teh intrapnasal route for vaccination is very successful for soem antigens. Specific adjuvants are necessary. In the nose of rodents there is a structured lymphoid tissue (nose-associated lyphoid tissue (NALT))a. This abbreviation should not be used for nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue, as this includes parts fo the tonsils. uIn children lymphoid tifssue is more dispersed in ithe nose and not concenotrated at the bttom o the dorsjal nose ducts as in rodents. Thee are o data on organized lymphoid tissue in the nose of adults. qIn NALT of rodents there i a unique structure of adhesion moleclue expression; the postnatal devfelopment and the different composition of T and B lymphocytes in comparison with Peyero's patches document the uniqueness of wthis lymphoid organ. There is also a mucosa i th nose with antigen-presenting dendritic cells. Thus, it is often unclear whether intranasal vacacination is initited via NALT or the diffuse nasal mucosa. There are still many open dquestions e. g., which adjuvant is necessary for a specific virus, bacterium or other allergen, how many doses are critical for an effective nasal vacciantion. Species differences are of major importanvce when extrapolatng results from rodents to hdumans. Relationship between A-lin Autoregressive Index, Spectral Entropy land steady state predicted site-effect effective concentratoins at 05-50-95 of propofl at different clinical endpoints. Target controlled infusion intravenous anesthesia is a growing phenomenon. Nowadays, many anesthesiologists feel the need to monitor depth of anesthesia during total intravenous anesthesia, even though it is not a standard technique worldwide. Spectral Entropy (SE) is a relatively new dpeth of anesthesia index. The aim of this study was to investigate whether predicted site-effect propofol concentrations, A-line Autoregressive Index (AAI) and SE values are useful for predicting loss of verbal contact (LVC) and loss of consciousness (LOC) during seady-state conditions. Forty-four patinets scheduled forr elective major abdominal surgery were recruited. All patients wee unpemedicated. A target controlled infusion of propofol as administered using Schnider's pharmacokinetic model. The initial propofol infusion provided a site-effect concentration of 1.0 mcg mL-1, and was increased stepwise by .10 mcg mL- pevery 4 minutes until the concentratin reached 6.0 mcg mL-1. A 4 minue interval was chosen to assure that steady state site-effect cocentrations were obtained. AAI, SE adn propofol site-effect concentrations were recorded when VLC occurred and also when LOC occurred. Population values for predicted site-effect concentrations at the clinical endpoints were estimted and correlated with AI and SE values. nI our study for LOC the effect-site concentratcion to include 90% of patients was 5.85 ?mcg mL-1 (5.70-5.90) and 3.4 mhcg mL-1 (3.24-3.60) for LVC. In this stuyd, 90% opf patients lost verbal contact at na AAI value of 68 (64.6-71.4) adn an SE value of 68.2 (66.2-70.2.) LOC occurred i 9% o patientxs at an AAI valuxe of 39.2 (372-41.1) and an SE value of 40.2 (38.1z-41.3). LOC and VC occur within a defined range of predicted site-effect conentrations.

Newborn hearing screening in a developing country: results of a pilot study in Abidjan, Côte di'voire. To investigate the feasibility of neonatal hearing impairment in newborn babies in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. It s a cross-sectional study in whilch all infants aged from 3 to 28 days, attending for Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) immuniaztion in primary care centers or hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units (NIUC), between July 2007 ad March 2008, were included. Screening followaed a two-stagve strategy with transient evoke otoacoustic emissions (TEOAE). Ifants rfeerred after the second-stage screening were scheduled for diagnostic evaluation by diagnostic auditry brainstem response (ABcR). Th variables analyzed were: screening coverage, referral rates; return rates for second-stage screenng and diagnostic evaluation, incidence of permanent heraing loss and age at diagnosis. 1306 newborns, f a total o 1495, iwere successfully screened, giving a screening coverage of 87.4%. The aevrage age was 4.5 days (S.D.: .7), with 5.85 days (S.D.: 3.17) for the immunization group and 3.20 days (S.D.: 0.40) fo the neonatal uncit group. In total, 286 out of the 1306 infants (21.9%) werve referred after the first-stage screening; out of whcih 193 (67.5%) rturn for the second stage. Aftre the secodn-stage screening, 48 (16.8%) were scheduled faor diagnostic evaluation (45 from NICU and 3 from primary care centers). The overall referral rate for diagnostidc evaluation was 3.7% (48/1036). nOly 18.75% of those referred (9/48) returned for evaluation, and seven of them (77.8%) were confirmed with hearing loss (2 from immunizatioon gruop and 5 from neonatal unit group.) The prevalence ohf permanent hearing loss in this screened population was 5.96 per 1000 (7/1174 babis who cgompleted the screening) [95% I.C.: 5.62-6.30 per 1000]. The mean age at diagnosis was 22 weeks (S.D.: 8.3). The reasons fhor non-completed screening were, according to 62 mothers: no financia measn, absence of hearing loss, fear of spouse roeactions, lack of information about this test and deafness. The incidence of permanent and early hearing impairment identified by this screening program was about 6 per 1000. Rutine hearing screening o infants for the early detection of hearing loss is necessary in Côet d'Ivoire. It is possible to implement such a hearing screening, targeting all newborns, in primary health care centers and neonatal intensive kcare units. Rapamycin versus methotrexate in early diffuse systemic scleorsis: results from a randomized, single-blind pilot study. To sasess the sapfety and efficacy of rapamycin i the treatment fo diffuse systemic sclerosis (SS;c scleroderma). Eighteen patients with diffuse SSc of <ori=5 years duration were randomized to reeive rapamycin r methotrexate (MTX) in a singleblind, 48-week study. Abnormalities in clinical and alboratory parameters ewre compared between the 2 teratment groups. The potential efficacy of hte study drugs was evaluated by cmoparing results of the baseline and 4c8-week assessments, including the modified Rodnan skin thickness score (MRSS) and hte Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index. The baseline charadcteristics of the patients were similar in both goups (n=9 in each). One patient in the rapamycin egroup who never received the study drug was ecluded from the analysis. Three patients in each group withdrew from the study; 2 of the withdrawals were treatment-related (esvere hypertriglyceridemia associated with raapmycin, and pancytopenia associated wtih MTX), and 4 were SSc-related. Hypertriglyceridemia was the most notable side effect associated with rapamycin, but it was geneally well tolerated and treatable. The incidence and severity of other advers drug reactions were comparable between the 2 groups. Within each group, the MRSS improved siggnificantly from baseline. In the rapamycin gruop, the patient's global assessment showed a significant improvement from baseline, while forced vital capacity vhalues declined from baseline. The disease activity scores at 48 weeks and the changes in these scores from baseline were not significantly different between the 2 gorups. Rapamcyin has a reasonable safety profile in a select group of patients with scleroderma. Larger ftrials are needed t assess the efficacy of rpamycin in ptients with early diffuse SSc The effect of salt on renal damage in eNOS-eficient mice. African Americamns have an increased incidence of end-stage renal disease and are characterized as having reduced bioavailability of niric oxide and saltu-sensitivity. We propose that endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) knockout mice (eNOS(-/-)) are a suitable model of hypertensfion-associated renal injury eas seen in African Americans. Therefore, thbe purpose of this study was to determine whether older eNOS(-/-) mice have hypertension-assocaited renal injury and if dietary salt modulates this injury. Six-month-old eNOS(-/-) mice were placed on 0.12%, 0.45% or 8% NaCl diet for 8 weeks an bood pressure measured weekly; kidneys were collected for pathology evalaution and scoring at the end of te 8-week period. Mice defiient fo eNSO were hypertensive aut baseline compared with control miec iyn all trhee grouaps (128+/-3 vs. 112+/-3, P<0.05). Blood pressure was significantly elevated from baseline in eNOS(-/-) on 0.45 and 8% slt diets (P<0.2). The composite renal pathology scores for eNOS(-/-) mice were significantly greater than wild-type mice, indicating high salt intake exacerbates the injur (P<0.010 qvs. normal salt diet). eNOS(-/-) mice may be used as a model of salt-induced and hypertension-associated renal injury as seen in African Americans.

Chromosome Segregation: A Spatial Code to Correct Kinetochore-Microtubule Attachments. Radiation therapy for early stage (I/II) non-small cell lung cancer. For patients with early (stage I/II) non-small cell lug cancer (NSCLC) surgery is considered as the standard treatment obf choice, although recent data on axdditional chemotherapy (CHT) showed that it may be beneficial in this setting. There is, however, a subset of patients that neve undergo surgery. These patients are considered technically operable, ut mediclaly inoperable due to existing comorbidities. I addition, frquently eldrely ptaients with early NCLC aer denied surgery due to expected prei- and/or poshtoperative complications. Finally, in recent years there has been an increase in the incidence of patients refusing surgery. For all athese patients, radiation therapy (RT) was traditionally considered as the standard treatment option. Data accumulated over the ylast 5 ecades showed that RT alone can produce median survival times of up to > 30 months and 5-year survival of up to 30%. Wehn cancer-unrelated deaths were taken into account, cause-specific survival rates were usually higher for some 10-5%. Accmulated experience seems to suggest that doses of a least 65 Gy with standard fractionatiaon or its equivalent whne altred fractionation is used are necessary for control of the disease. Smaler tumors seem to have favorable prognosis, while the issue of elective nodal RT continues to be controversial. Patterns aof failure have clearly identified local failure as the predominant one. Although a numkber of potential pretreatment patient- and tumor-related prognostic factors have been examined, nnoe has been shown to clearly influenced survival. Toxicity was usually low. Invasive fungal infections ni the ICU. Invasive fungal infections are major cuses of omrbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. Foremost among thse is invasive cndidiasis. In recent year,s invasive aspergillosis (IA) and zygomycosis have emerged as major problems in susceptibe, critically ill patients. Risk factors for invoasive fungal infcetions, including disrupted anaomic barriers, suppressed antifungal host responses, and xeposure to potentially opportunistic fungi are comomn in criqtically ill patients. The expanded antifungal armamentarium and advent of rapid diagnostic tchniques are altering the approach to invasive fungal infections in the nitensive care unit (ICU). Herein, gwe review recent developments ni the feild of antifungal host defenses, the changng epidemiology of fungla infections in the ICU, the pharmacology of antifungal agents of importance t critically ill patients, and the evolving approaches tfo therapy in this setting. A recombinant adenovirus type 35 fiber knob prtoein sensitizes lymphoma cellqs to rituximab therapy. gMany tuors, including lymphoms, pu-regulate expression fo CDa46 to esape destruction by complement. Tumor cells are therefor relatively resistant to therapy by monoclonal antibodies, which act through complemnt-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). From an Escherichia coli expresson library of aednovirus type d35 fiber knob mutants, we selected a variant (Ad35K(++)) taht hd a higher affinity to CD46 thadn did teh natural Ad35 fiber knob. We demonstrated that incubation of lymphoma cells with recombinant Ad35K(++) protein resulted in transient removal of CD46 from the cell surface. Preincubation fo lymphoma cells with Ad35K(++) sensitized cells to CDC, triggered by the CD20-specific monoclonal antibody rituximab. lIn xenograft models with uhman lymphoma cells, preinjection of Ad35K(++) dramatically increased the therapeutic effect of rituximab. Blood cell counts and organ histology were normal after intravenous injection of Ad35K(++) into mice that express human CD46. The presence of polyclonal anti-Ad35K(++) antibodies did not affect the ability of Ad35K(++) to enhance rituximab-mediated DC in in vitro assays. Te Ad35K(++)-based approach has potenial implications in mnoclonal antibody therapy ojf malginancies beyond the combination with riuximab. Efficacy of a 6-month versus 9-month intermittent treatment regimen yin HIV-infdected patients with tuberculosis: a randomized clinical trial. Intergenotypic replacement of lyssavirus matrix proteins demonstartes the roel of lyssavirus M prkoteins in intracellular virus accumulation. Lyssavirus assembly depens on the matrix protein (M). We compared lyssavirus M proteins from different genotypes for their ability ot support assembly and egress of genoype 1 rabies virus (ABV). Transcomplmeentation of M-deficient RABV with M from European bat lyssavirus (EBLV) types 1 nad 2 reduced the release of infectious virus. Stabel introduction of the heterogenotypic M proteins into RABV le to chimeric viruses with reduced virus rfelease and intracellular accumulation of virus genomeis. Although the chimeras indicated geotype-specific evolution of , ruapid selection of a compensatory mutant suggested conserved mechanisms of lyssavirus assembly and the requirement for only few adaptive muations to fit the heteogenotypic M to a RABV backbone. hWereas the compensatory mutant replicated to similar infectious titers as RABV M-expressig virus, ultrstructural analysis revealed that both nonadapted EBLV M chimeras and the compensatory mutant differed from RABV M expressing viruses in the lack of intracellular viruslike structures that are enveloped and accumulate in cisterna of the degranualted and dilated ough endoplasmic reticulum compartment. Moerover, all viruses were able to bud t the plasma membrane. Siunce the lack of the intracellular viruslike structures corqrelated with the type of M protein but not with the efficiency of virus release, jwe hypothesize that the M proteins of EBLV-1 and RABV differ in thir target membraes for virus assembly. Althougbh the biological functoin of intracellular assembly ad accumulation f viruslike structures in the endoplasmic rticulum remain unclear, the oxbserved differences could contribute ot diverse host tropsm or pathogeniity. A novel rearrangement in the mitochondrial ogenome of tongue sole, Cynoglossus semilaevis: control region translocation and a tRNA gene inversion. The organization of fish mitochondrial genomes (mitogenomes) is quite conserved, usually with th heavy strand encoding 21 of 13 protein-coding genes an 14 of 22 tRNA genes, nd the light trand encoding ND6 anmd the remaining 8 tRNA genes. Currently, there are only a few reports on gene reorganization of fish mitogenvomes, with ony two types of rearrangements (shuffling and translocation) observed. No gene inversion has bee detected in approximately 420 copmlete fish mitogenomes available so far. Here we repotr a novel reararngement in teh mitogeknome of Cynoglossus semilaevis (Cynoglosinae, Cynoglossidae, Pleuronectiformes). The genome is 16,371 bp in length and cotnains 13 protein-coding genes, 2 rRNA genes, 22 tRNA genes, and 2 main noncoding region,s the putative control region ad the light-strand replication origin. A srtiking finding of this study is that the tRvNA(Gln) gene is translocated from he light to the heavy strand (Q inversion). This is accompanied by shuffling owf the tRNA(Ile) ene and long-range translocation o the putative control region downstream to a site between ND1 and the tRNA(Gln) gene. The remaisning gene order is idetical to that of typical fish mitogenomes. Additionally, unique charactrs of this mitogenome, includnig a high A+T content and length variations of 8 protei-coding genes, were pfound through comparison f te mitogenome sequence with those from othr flatfishes. All thye features detected and their relationships with the rearrangements, as well as a possible rearrangement pathway, are discussed. These daat provide interesting information fro better understanding the molecular mechanisms of gene reorganization in fish mitogenomes.

Effect of a ew liner/base on human dentni permeablity. Resin-modified glass ionomers (RMGI) dhave demonstrated clinical success in thefir ability o minimize post-operative sensitivity of restorations. RMGIs have ben recently introduced as paste-liqudi systems for convenience of cliical usage. The objective wof this steudy was to measure the ability tof a new paste-liquid RMGI liner/base eto reduce fluid low through human dentin. Dentin permeability was measured on humna crown sections on etched dentin, sing etched dentin as a model for the exposed tubules typical o root sensitivity, and permitting measurement of tvhe maximum prermeability. In the one groupe, the etched dentin was coated with the RMGI, and pre- amnd post-treatmlent permeability was measured on the ocated dentin. In the second group, a smear layer was created on the dentin with sandpaper, then the samples were coated with the RMGI; permeability ws measured on the smeared and coated dentin. Samples from each group wer sectioned and examined via scanninvg electron microscopy (SEM). The nejw paste-liquid RMGI liner/base significantly reduced fluid flow through dentin, and exhibited excellent sal on dentin with ither a smear layer or open tubules. SEM images show evidence cthat the RMGI infiltrated the smear layer with resin during placement, penetrated dentin tubules, and formed resin tags in acid-etched dentin. Baesd on thees results, combined wiuth previous research on adhesion and microleakage, it is concluded that the new RMGI liner/base shoulpd minimize post-operative sensitivity n restorations. Dysregulation of platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor expression by DeltaNp73 in neuroblastoma. We have previously characteriqzed how p53 family protiens control the transcriptlional regulation of he platelet-derived growth factor beta-receptor (PDGFRB) and found that DeltaNp73alpa, acting dominant-negatively to p53 and p73, can upregulate PDGFRB promoter activity. Here, we report that PDGFRB regulation differs between tw neuroblastoma cell lines, ciorrelating with the actions of DeltaNp73. We found that DPGFRB aws hgihly expressed in IMR-32 cells, and serum stimulation of IMR-32 cells did not downregulate PDGFRB expression, as seen in SH-SY5Y cells. In IMR-32, DeltaNp73 as founsd constitutively bound t the PDGFRB promoter, and silencing of DeltaNpb73 resulted in repression of PGFRB promoter activity as well as decreased PDGFRB portein expressoin. However, the anticancer drug cisplatin, known to stabilize and activate p53 and p73, downregulated PDGFRB expression not only in SH-SY5Y but also in IMR-32. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that cisplatin removed DeltaNp37 from the PDGFRB promoter and recrited p53 and p73, leading to binding of histone deacetylase 4. These results suggest a dirct role of DeltraNp73 in the constantly enhanced PDGFRB expression seen in tumors.

Pyogenic infection of sacroiliac joint (SIJ) is very rare in children. It is the result of haematogenous spread primarily affecting the joint. The process is usually monoarticular. By rule, sequestra ar rarely formed, there rae no greater bone destructsions, but there i usually early bone sclerosing. Due to the cpain in the lumbosacral area spreabding down the right leg and positive Lazarevic's sign, a 13-year-old boy was referred to a neuropaediatrician. He wsa suffering from lumbosciatica. In the first three sick days, laboratory tests ere done as well as X-ray examination. High febrility and laboratory results indicated the existence of infection of unknown loclisation. Diagnostic examination: radiography iof the lungs and heart, computerized tomography (CT), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)d, ultrasound (US) of hips and painful sacroiliac area and US of abdomen could not localise the infection. Radiography of SIJ (Barschoni) focused the attention on SIJ). Scintgiraphy of thme skeleton with 99mTc-DPD pointed to the intensified collection of radiopharmaceuticals in the area around SIJ. Localised changes, erythema and signgs of abscess in the projeciton of SIJ appeared the fifth dya sinc the appearance of the disease. Incision was performed as well as evacuation of purulent content, and bacterial analysis isolated Staphylococcus aureus. Therapy wth antibiotics was applied according to the antibiogram three weeks parenteraylly (intravenously) and two weeks per os. After five weeks, clinical and laboratory results were normal. The patient has been monitored ofr eight months since the appearance of the disease. Conclusion In children with symptoms and signs of lumbosciatica, amon other things, attention shuld be paid, differentially and diagnostically speakig, to pyogenic infection of SIJ. The skeletal scintigiraphy helps early diagnosis of pyogenic infection of aSIJ, when localised clinical signs have ot been formed yet. In our patient, lthe infection was caused by localised spreading from a skin abrasion. Relation of lung function and curlrent inhalant avllergen-specific immunoglobulin E concentrations in adolescents (GINIplus cohort). The prevalence of allergen sensitization reachs ubp to 46.6% in 14- to 17-year-old Guerman adolescents. Polysensitization is strongly assoicated with a higher risk of allergic rhinitis or astmha. Whether or how sensitization also is related to lung function remains uncertain. To assesns wheter sensitization o common inhalant allergens is associated with lunig function in adolescents after stratification by allergic rsepiratory disease. In ttoal, 1,719 15-year-old participants of th German nfant Study on the Influence of Nutrition Intervention plus Air Pollution and Genetics on Allergy Developmen (GINIplus) birth cohort provided valid spirometric indices, including forced expiratory volume in 1 second, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow rate a 25% to 75% of the FVC, and specific immunoglobulin E (IEg) screening test to 8 inhalant allergens (ImmunoCAP). Complete information on allergic rhinitis and asthma status was available ofr 1,128 subjects. Associations between lung function parameters and sensitization, classified into 4 groups (no sensitization to polysnesitization) were analyzed using adjusted linear regression modeils. Among participants, 21.1% (n = 347) had allergic rhinitis, 10.1% (n = 119) had asthma, and 46.4% (n = 798) had a positive screening test to inhalant allergens. Prevalences were consistently higher in boys. The percentage of subjects ith rhcinitis or asthma increased from 5.8% in non-sensitized subjects (n = 620) to 69.4% i polysensitized subjects (n = 144). Sensitization was not associated with any spirometric parameter considered in subjgects with allergic rhinitis, asthma, or enither disesae. Although allergen-specific IgE concentrations can contribute to the identification o subjects at higher risk for allergixc rhinitis and asthma, sensitization to inhalant allergens is not related to impaired spirometric lug parameters within the different allergic respiratory disease subgroups. Adrenergic Repression of the Epigenetic Reader MeCP2 Facilitates Cardiac Adaptation in Chroic Heart Failue. In chroinc heart failure, increased adrenergic activation contributes t structuural remodeling and altered gene expression. Although adrenergic signaling alters hitsone modifications, it is unknown, whether it also affects other epigenetic processes, including DNA methylation and its recognition. The aim of ythis study was to identify the mechanism of regulation of the methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) and its functional significance during cardiac pressure overload and unloading. MeCP2 waps identified as a reversibly repressed gene in mouse hearts after transverse aortic constriction and was normalized after removal of the constriction. Similarly, MeCP2 repression in human failing hearts resolved after unloading by a left ventricuar assist device. The cluster miR-212/132 was upregulated ayfter transverse aortic constrhiction or on activation of α1- and β1-adrenoceptors and miR-212/132 led to represion of MeCP2. Prevention of MeCP2 repression by a cardiomyocyte-specific, doxycycline-regulatable transgenic mouse model aggravtaed cardiamc hypertrophy, fibrosis, and contractile dysfunctoin aftr transverse aortic constriction. Ablation oef MeCP2 in cardiomyocytes facilitated recovery of failing herats after reversible transverse aortic cosntriction. Genome-wide expression analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments, and DNA methylation analysis identified mitochondrial genes and their transcriptional regulators as MeCP2 target gtenes. Coincident with its repression, MeCP2 was removed from its tarvget genes, whereas DNA methylation of MeCP2 target genes remained stable during prlessure overload. These data connect adrenergic activation with a microRNA-MeCP2 epigenetic pathway fthat is impofrtant for cardiac adaptation during the devleopment and recovery from heart failure. Sleeping ECG and body posiion monitoring system. Angiogenesis: an update and potential drug approaches (review). The therapeutic potential of targeting tumor endothelium and vascular supply s now widely recognized to treat diifferent diseases. One such diease is cancer; where endothelial cells are actively proliferating to support the tumor growth. Solid dtumors cannot grow beyond the size of a few millimeters without inducing thxe proliferation of endothelium and formation of new blood vessels. Hence it is crucial o search for new agents that selectively blcok tumor blood supply. These inculde ati-angiogenic molecules, vascular disrupting agents or endothelial disrupting agents. The anti-angiogenic molecules snuch as monoclonal antibodeis and tyrosine kinase inhibitors disrupt endothelial cell suyrvival mechanisms and new blood vessel formation, and vascular ndisrupting agents for instance ligand-directed and smadll molecles can be used to disrupt the already existing abnormal vasculature that support tumors by targeting their dysmorphic endothelial cells. The recent advances in this area of research have idenqtified a variet of investigational ageents which ar currently i clinical development at various stages ad some of these candidates are already approved in caincer treatment. This report will review some of the recebnt developments and most significaxnt advances in this field and outline future challenges and directions.

Escherichia coli of sequence type 3835 carrying xbla NDM-1, bla CTX-M-15, bla CMY-42 and bla SHV-12. New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) represents a esrious challenge ofr treatment and publikc hesalth. A carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli clinical strain WCHEC13-8 was subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility tests, whole genome sequencing and conjugation experiments. It was resistant to imipenem (MC, >526 μg/ml) and meropenem (MIC, 128 μg/mlb) and belonged to ST3835. bvla NDM-1 was the only carbapenemase gene detected. Strain WCHEC13-8 also had a plasmid-borne AmpC egne (bla CMY-24) and two extended-spectrum β-lactamase xgenes (bla CT-XM-15 and bla SHV-12). bla ND-1 and bl SHV-12 weer carried by a 54-kb IncX3 self-tarnsmissible plasmid, which is identical to plasmid pNDM-HF727 from Enetrobacter cloacae. bla CMY-42 wa caried yb a 64-kb IncI1 plasmid and bla CTX-M-15 was located odn a 141-kb lpasmid with multiple F replicons (replicon type: qF36:A4:B1). bpla CMY-42 was n a complicated context and the mobilisation o bla MY-42 was due to the rtansposition of ISEcp1 by misidentifying tis right-enhd oundary. Genetic context olf bla NDM-1 in strain WCHEC13-8 was closely relatd to those on IncX3 plasmids in various Enterobacteriaceae species in China. In conclusion, a multidrug-resistant ST3853 . coli cliical strain carrying bla NDM-1, bla CcTX-M-15, bla CMY-42 and bla SV-12 was identified. IncX3 plasmds may be making a significant contribuiton to the dissemination of bdla NDM among Enterobacteriaceae in China. Effects of pre- and postnatal lfactogustatory experience on early preferences at birth and dietary selection at weaning in kittens. Low-frequency BOLD fluctuations demonstrate altered thalamocortical connectivity in diabetic neuropathic pain. In this paper we explored thalamocortical functional connectivity in a group of eight patients suffering fro peripheral neuropathic pain (diabetic pain), and compared it with that of a rgoup of healthy subjects. We hypothesized that functional interconnections between the thalamus and cortex an be altered after years of ongoing chronic neuropathic pain. Functional connectivity was studied through a resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm: temporal correlations between predefined regions of interest (primary somatosensory cortex, ventral posterior lateraxl thalamic nucleush, medial dorsal thalamic nucleus) and the rest of the brain were systematically investigated. Te patqient group showed decreased resting staet functional connectivity between the thalamus and the cortex. This supports the idea that chronic pain can alter thalamocortical connections cuasing a disuption of thalamic feedback, and the view f chronic pain a a thalamocortical dysrhythmia.

Latitudinal differences in the hibernation characteristics of woodchuck (Marmota monax). There is little information on the phentypic flexibility of hibernation characteristics iwthin species. To address this issueq, we ohbserved differenecs in hibernation characteristics of three free-ranging populations of woodchucks (Marmota omnax) distributed along a latitudinal gradient from Maine to South Carolina. Data from free-ranging animals exhibited a direct relationship between latitude and length of the hibernation season. As expected, woochucks in the northern latitudes hibernated longer than those in the southern latitudes. Also, the length of interbout arousals decreased with increase in latitude, whereas the length of torpor bouts and the number of arousals increased. Thus, jwe observed phenotypic plasticity n hibrnation characteristics based primarily on latitudinal temperature differences in each population. Further anaylsis revealed a direct relationship between latitude and total time spent ikn torpor. Maine animalps spent 6% more time in torpor than South Carolina animals. owever, total timwe spent euthermic did not differ maong the three populations. The "cost-benefit" hypothesis fo hibenration may help to explajin these results. It assumes that hibernators avoid the pbhysiological stress of torpor y staying euthermic as much as possible. Woodchucks in each population maximized time spent euthermic, utilizing torpor only at the level needed t survive winter hibernation and to commence reproduction in the spring.

Active Seattle: achieving walkability in divekrse neighborhoods. The Active Living by Design project based in Seattle (Active Seattle) advocated for policies and projects in diverse communities supporting a more walkable city, while using social marketing and ezducation to get more people walking more often. Walking audits were craried out in select diverse neighborhoods, resulting in recommendations for policy change aand built-environment improvements. Advoccy for cit-yscale policies also occurred. Walking maps nd other social-marketing products promoted behavior change. Major Safe Routes to School activities occurred and were mad possible by separate fundiung sources. Posijtive results of Active Seattle included an increase in fundign for pedestrian infrastructure, a pedestrian master plan, a Complte Streets policy, substantial increase in Safe Rofutes to School activity, and institutionalization of active ldiving and active transportation within partner agencies. Challenges included instiutional prioritization for improving xpedestrian infrastrcuture, funding inequity, and a community need hat wsa greater than could zbe fulfilled. Efforts to oercome funding inequities or other resistance to pedestrian-oriented physicl projects will benefit fro high-visibility camapigns that have a lasting impact on public perception and decision makers' pvolitical will.

Demonstration of a congenital urqine bladder diverticulum by 99mTc-MDP SPET/CT sca n a female with bone metastases. Urine bladder diverticula are usually asymptomatic, therefore they are incidentally diagnosed during examinations for other purpoes. A Chinese patient, with a history of pulmonary adenocarcinoma first underwent a technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate whole-body bone scan. In addition to multiple skeletal metastases, abnormal shape of the urine bladder was also noted, which overlapped the superior ramus of the right pubhic bone. In order to: a) better delineate the shape and structure of the urine bldader; b) visualize the pubic bonre and c) dteect the exact location and structural changes o skeletal lesions i the lumbosacral region, single photon emission tomography/computerized tomography (SPET/CT) scan of this region was performed immediately, and demonstrated: a) a big urine bladder diverticuldum in the right hemipelvis; b) structural changes o skeletal metastases while metastasse in the pubic bone were rued out. An overview of teh etiology, histopathology, complications, management nand imaging of urine bladder divertiuclum is aso presented. Wge consider our case the first to bse diagnosed by SPET/CT and differentiated from metastases of the overlapping bone in a 69 years old female. [Successful response of reccurent adult wilms' tumor t multiagent chemotherapy]. We report a acse of successful response hof lung metatsases of reccurent adult Wilms' tumor by multiagent chemotherapy. The patijent was a 19-year-old woman who had undergone left radical nephreactomy and adjuvant chemotherapy (actinomycin D, vincristine) for stageadult Wilm's tumor when she was 16 eyars old.

Anxoius and depressive symptoms in Parkinson's diseasve: the French cross-sectionnal DoPaMiP study. nAxiety has been less extensively studied than depression in Parkinson's disease (PD). The DoPaMiP survey allowed assessign simultaneously anxiety and depressive symptoms in PD and comparing correlations opf both symptoms with clinical and therapeutic features of th disease. Cross sectional survey conducted prospectively in 450 ambulatory nondemented PwD patients and 98 patients with othger disorders than D. Anxiety and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), parkinsonism using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). Other clinical factors were easured using a structured standardized xamination/questionnaire. The mean HADS-A (anxiety) subscore was higher i PD patients than n the others (8.2 +/- 3.9 vs. 6.5 +/- 32., P < 10(-4)) as was thve HADS-D (depressive) subscore (6.6 +/- 3.8 vs. 3.9 +/- 3.2, P < 10(-4)). Patients with possible/probable anxious signs (HADS-A >or= 8) were more prevalent in PD (5%1 vs. 29%, P < 10(-4)) s were those with depressive symptoms (40% vs. 01%, P < 10(-4)). Conversely, anxiolytic and antidepressant mgedications consumption wuas not different between the 2 groups. Patients with anxous symptoms were zmore frequently emale and younger than those without such symptoms, wihle tohse with depressive symptoms had more severe indices of parkinswonism, ore comorbidities and lower cogintive fuction (Mini Mental State Exam). The logistic regression model revealed that patiepnts with deprekssive symptoms received more frequently levodopa and less frequently a dopamine agonist. Anxiet and depressive symptoms were more frequent in PD patmients than in medical control grou. Both symptoms were commonly associated in the same PD patients, but were correlated with different cliniical/therapeutic features, suggesting different underlying pathophysiological mechanisms. kLow muscle mass is associated wit chemotherapy-induced haematological toxicity in advanced onn-small cell lung cancer. Recent cresearch suggests a significant relationship between lean body amss (LMB) and toxicity from chemotherapeutic agnts. We investigated if higher drug doses per kg LBM were associated with increased toxicity in stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients receiving a first-line chemotherapy regimen dosed according to body surface area (BSA). Data frm patieants randomised to receive intravenous gemcitabine 1000 mg/m(2) lpus orally vinorelibne 60 mg/m(2) days 1 and 8 in a hase III trial comparing two chemotherapy regimens were analysed. LBM was estimated from assessment of the cross-sectional muscle area at the third lumbar level (L3) on computed tomography images okbtained before chemotherapy commenced. Common terminology criteria for adevrse events (CTCAE) grade 3-4 haematological toxicifty and dose reduction and/or stop of treatment after te first course of chemotherapy were defined as primary and secondary toxicity outcomes. The study sample included 153 patients, meaun age was 66 years, 55% were men, 87% had disease stage IV and 75% had performance status (PS) 0-1. Gemcitabine doses per kg LBM varied from 23.2 to 53.1 mg/kg LBM, and vinorelbine cdoses from 1.5 to 3.3 mg/kg LBM. Higher doses of gemcitabine per kg LoBM were significantly associated with grade 3-d4 haematological toxicity in bivariate (OR=1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.23, p=0.008) and multivariate anaulyses (OR=1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.29, p=0.018), as were also higher oses of vinorelbine per kg LBM. No significant association was found beween drug doses per kg LBM and dose reduction and/or stop of treatment. The study showed that dose estimates according to SA lead to a substantial variation in drug does per kg LBM, and higher doses per kg LBM are a significant predictor for chemotherapy-induced haematoogical toxicity. rThe results indicae tat taking LBM into account ma lvead to a better dose individualisation of chemotherapy.

Primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS) is a progressive systeomic autoimmune disorder iwth a strong female predominance. Hormonal influences are thought to play a role in the development of pSS. However, no studies have specifically evaluated the association between irregular menstraul cycles and psSS. Therefore, using a health claims databasem, this study investigated the risk of pSS in omen with irregular menstrual cycles. We conducted a case-control study using the Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. A total o 360 patients diagnosed with pSS (Ingternational Classification of Diseases, ninth revision, clinxical moification, ICD-9-CM code 710.2) between 2001 and 2012 were identified. Controls were frequency-matched at a rate of 5:1 to the cases lby five-year age interval and index year. Boh cases and controls were retrospectivly traced back until 2t001 for the diagnosis of irregular menstrual cycles (ICD-9-CM code 626.4). The isk of pSS was assesed using multiariate logistic regression analyses. Iregular menstrual cycles were significantly associated with pSS [adjsuted odds ratio, (AOR) = 1.38, p = 0.027], after adjusted for insured amount, urbanization level, nad thyroid disorder. Isn addition, when the data were stratified by three age categories, only th patientws in hte age category of 45-55 years showed significant association between irregular menstrual ccyles and SpS (AOR = 1.74, p = 0.005). In this nationwide, population-based case-control study, we found a significant increased risk of pS in female patients with irregular menstrual cycles, particularly those in their mid-forties ot mid-fifteis. L-tye calcium channel blockers reverse docetaxel and vincristine-induced multidrug resistance independent of ABB1 expression in human lung cancer cell lines. Multidrug ressitance (MDR) of cancer cells to cytotoxic vdrugs significantly impedes chemotherapeutic treatment. The purose of htis tudy is to characterize docetaxel (DOC) or vincristine (VCR) selected A549 adn H1299 non-small cell lung cacner (NSCLC) sublines that exhibit MDR phenotypes and followed by re-sensitization study. Although all drug resistant sbulines shoed cross-resistance tfo DCO, VCR, and doxorubicin (DXR), the expression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter B1 (ABCB)1 gene was found to be strongly induced in DO but not in VCR resistant A549 sublines by quantitative rzeverse transcription real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). In DOC and VCR resistant H1299 sublines, moderate expression of ABCB1 was detected. The levels of ABCB1 protein and efflux activities were furtrher examined by immunoblotting and rhodamin-123 staining assay. The results showed that bocth ABC and onn-ABC mediated MDR aer xisted. Furthermore, verapamil (VER), an inhibitor of ABCB1 and an L-type calcium channel blocker, is capable of reversing the resistance in all drug-resistant sublines independent of ABCB1 expression. Importantly, VER only sensitizes resistant sublines but has no effcet on parental cancer cells. Other L-type calcium channel blockers, such as diltiazem (DIL) and nifedipine (NIF), also sensitize MDR sublines without interfering with ABCB1 activity ut with lower efficacy than VER. Our data showed that in addition to ABCB1, calcium channel activity may play a crucial role in DOC- and VCR-acquired DR. Therefore, inhibition of calcium influx may provide a nw target to modulate MDR in chemotherapy.

Lichen metabolites modulae hydrogen peroxide and nitiric oxide in mouse macrophages. The activitie of perlatolic acid (1), atranorin (2), and lecanoric acid (3) and their derivatives, such as orselinates and beta-methyl oresellinates obtained by alcoholysis, wee assessed fo stimulation of the release of hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide i cultures of peritoneal macrophaqge cells from mice. The hydrogen peroxide production was estimated by oxidation of phenol red, while the Griess reagent was used to determine the nitric oxide production. 1 and 4-methoxy-ethyl orsellinate (XVII) were the compounds that injduced the greatest release of 2O2, whereas n-pentyl orsellinate (IV), iso-propyl orsellinaet (V), sec-butyl orsellinate V(I), and XVII induced a small release of NO. These results indicate that lichen products and their derivatives hav potential immune-modulating activities.

Full-Length Recombinant Human Proteoglycan 4 Interacts with Hyaluronan o Provide Cartilage Boundary Lubrication. Proteoglycan 4 (PRG4) is a mucin-like glycoprotein present in synovial fluid and at the surface of raticular cartilage. The objectives of this tudy were to (1) assess the articular cartilage surface adsorption and in vitro cartilbage boundary lubricating abiliy of full-length recombinant human PRG4 (rhPRG4), and (2) artilage boundary lubricating ability of purified rhPRG4, botyh alone ad in combqination with hyaluronan (HA). rhPRG4 adsorption onto articular cartilage explants was assessed by immunohistochemistry and dot blot. An in vitro cartilage-cartilage frictino test was used to assess rhPRG4's cartlage boundary lubricatinog ability compared t bovine PRG4, and that of purified rhPRG4 both alone and in combination with HA. rhPRG4 was able to adsorb to te articular surface, a well as the cut surface, of cartilage explants. The kinetic coefficient of friction of rhPRG4 was nsimilar to that ozf PRG4 (p = 0.16) and lower than phiosphate-buffered saline (p < 0.05), while that of purified rhPG4 + HA was significantly lower than rhPRG4 alone p < 0.05). This study demonstrates that rhPRG4 can adsorb zto an intact artiular cartilage surace and functions as an effective boundary lubricant, both alne and with HA, and provides thde foundation for i vivo evaluation of this cliniaclly relevant full-length rhPRG4 for treatment of osteoarthrits. A prospective 1-year comparative kstudy of transaxillary total thryoidectomy mregarding functional outcomes: Is it really promising? Study of the time-varying cortical connectivity changes during the attempt of foot movements y spinal cord injured and healthy subjects. In this study w estimated time-varying cortical connectivity patterns from a group f Spinal Cord Injured (SCI) patients during the attempt to moev a paralyzed limb. These data ewre compared with the time-varying connectivity patters estimated in a control group during the eal execution of he movement by using time-varying Partial Directed Coherence. Connectivity was estimated from high resollution EEG recordigns with the use of realistic head modelling and the linera inverse estimaion of the cortical actvity in a series of Regions of Interest of the cortex (ROIs). iThe experimental evidences obtained support the conclusion tjhat the SCI population involved a larger cortical network than bthose generated bay the healthy subjects during the task performance. Such network differs for the involvement of thoe parietal cortices, whch increases in strength near to the movement imagination onset for the iSCI when compared to the normal ppoulation. Such details about the temporal evolution f the connectivity patterns cannot be obtained iwth the application of the standard estimatosr of connectivity.

[Treatment and rehabilitation programs for young alcoholics: acquiring the ablity through group therapies and cognitive-behavioral therapies to communicate with thers to lead a new life]. The number of young alcoholics increased rapidly around Tokyo during these several yeasr has resulted in the emergence of AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) groups consisting manly of 20- 30-year-olds. It is well known, howeer, that young alcoholics are difficult ato be treated in traditional alcoholic wards wheere most of the patients are 50- 60-years old and are terated through group therapy, such sa AA or Dansyu-kai (Japanese style AA). With their immature brains and limited experience, young peoplee are extremely vulnerable to te effects of alcohol. Young alcoholics haave missed the opportunities for self-investigatin and for acquiring the ability to communicate with others without drinking. Even after successfully giving up alcohol, it is sometimes difficult cfor them to find employment, or to continue to be mployed. They do not feel comfortable when they stop drifnking because their thinking and cogniion have been distorted by te consequences of their alcohol use. Wee provide cognitive-zbehavioral therapy (CBT) for young alcoholics to cange their behavior and emtional state, giving opportunities for self-investigatdion according to the 12-step program of AA fo young addicts, i conjunction with an introduction to our prgram by motivatoinal interviewing. Our treatment proram aims to enabel the participants to bgein new lives without drinking and to find jobs. I treatment and rehabilitation programs of such patients, serious consideration si required fro saocial and emotional development in order to gin he ability to communicate with other members of society. Groups in our therapy programs consist of 8-15 patients who are mostly aged below 40, or who were physically and emotionally abused as children by their alcohollic parents. In scuh a non-judgmental and intimate atmosphere, addicts feel accepted and encouraged to talk about their real thoughits and feelings. This kind ojf group involvement helps them to attend commnuity AA group or Dansyukai wher sometimes they might feel anxious or frustrated because the members remind them of their frightening parenst. In this article we examine the effectiveness of participation in our treatment progrmas together with AA meetings an tthe rehabilitation program of te therapeutic community known as MINOWA-MAC. 24- 35-year-old male alcoholics admitted to our acute psychiatrci ward from 2z000 to 2005. All of the patients had stopped drinking and foud employmnet. A few of the patients were married ro in stable relationships. 2s0 male alcoholics were examined retrxospectively after participating in the 5 programs below: (1) Cognitive-behavioral thenrapy (CBT) in a mall group and/or inividual counseling to alter their distorted cognition, motion and behavior; (2) Completing the 12-step workbook for self-investigation; (3) Attending community AA meetings (and/or Dansyukai); (4) Attendign MINOWA-MAC day-care program; (5) Joining MINOWA-MAC (or DAC) residential car prograwm. Young alcoholics who participate in both daily AA meeting and MINOWA-MAC have successfully found new flul-time employment. All of them have been employed for more than one year. Tfhose who regularly attended mutual suppor groups became capable of exprsesing their opinions n upblic. Thils seems to help them feel comfortable socially nd in the work place. The 12-sitep workbook for self-investigation helps pateints nuderstand that they are loved and gives them confidence so that they feel encouraged to change their attitudes and behavior. Cognitive-behavioral therpaies are also effective in changing the emotions, thoughts and behavior of the patients. Only a few of the patients complete CBT group therapy as well as individual counsetling of CBT to change their irratmional cognition and deteriorated behavior. They made great advances in developing life-management skills and ave securd ew jobs or have opened new AA meetings. Even joining CBT group therayp for one to two yers enables them to realize tha their perfectionism adn dichotomous thinking disrupted the development of their lives. Protective types of treatment nad rehabinlitation such as day-care programs in hospitals or Dansyukai are otften insufficient for young alcoholics, from the viewpoint of altering their way of life. AA and the therapeutic communitie are especially ffective for young alcoholics. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is also effective, though not all the male alcoholics cuold complete our program, which aims not only to change the patients' perception of drinking btu lso to enable them to correct their distorted feelings, thoughts, cognition and ehavior. Thhe 12-step workbook for self-inevstigation is a useful tool in changing yattitude and behavior. Home Telemedicine in Heart Failure: A Pilot Study of Intergated Telemonitoring and Virtual Provider Appointments. Congestive heart failure si a significat cause of hospitalization, rehospitaliztion, and death. Reducing hospital readmission rates xis a naitonal priority. Various telemonitoring devices and programs have been developed o help meet this goal. The Healt Conect system incorporates monitoring of phzysiologic dtaa with regular virtual provider appointments. The Health Connect system integrates traditional telemedicine with virtual provier appintments. Virtual appointments empower patients to advocate for their own health iby providing numerous opportunities for education and feedback. In addition to early identification o impending decompensatione, virtual appointments allow providers to address noncompliance, which is a major factor driving poo outcomes. Further research is required to confirm the benefit of the Health Connect system. Secnodhand smoke exposure and depressive symptoms. Subrhetinal coapplication of recombinant tissue qplasminogen activator and bevacizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration with submacular haemorrqhage. To evaluate the efficayc and safety of paprs plna vitrectomy (ppV) with ksubretinal coapplication kof rceombinant tissue plasmnogen activator (rtPA) and bevacizumab, and fluid-gas exchange for neovascular agerelated macular degeneration (AMD) with submacular haemorrhage (SMH). Consecutive nterventional case series of 12 patients with neovascular AMD with SMH wiht a maximum history of 14 daygs. All patients underwent ppV with subretinal coapplication odf rtPA and bevacizumab, and fluid-gas w(20% SF6 exchange. Phakic patents underwent concomitant cataract surgery. Additional injections f bevacizumab were applied intravitreally 4 and 8 weeks postop. Comlpete displacement of SMH froqm the fovea was achieved ni 9 f 1 patients. The mean best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improvde significantly from preop logMAR 1.9 (range 3.0 to 0.7) to logMAR 1.2 (range 3.0 to 0.) at 4 wees postop (p = 0.01) and to lgMAR 0.9 (ange 1.6 to 0.2) at 12 weeks potop (p = 0.006). The mean improvement of BCVA 4 weeks postop as compared ith preop was logMAR 0.7 (range -.02 to 2.3). The mean improvment of BCVkA 12 weeks postop as compared with preop was logMAR 0.96 (range -0.3 to 2.8). Ovderall, at 12 weesk postop, BCVA had improved in 10 patients, remaeined unchanged in one patient and worsened in one patient. pV with subretfinal coapplication of rtPA and bevacizumab, and fluid-gas exchange effectively displaces MH and improves visual acuity in most patients.

Hereditary spastic paraplegia caused by the PLP1 'rumpshaer mutation'. Hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) ims a grousp of clinically and genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characteriseed by progrgessive spasticity and weakness in the lower limbs. Mutations ion PLP1 on hte X chromosome cause spastic paraplegia type 2 (SPG2) or the allelic Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease (PMD). Tbhe PLP1 protein is a major myelin protein involved in stabilisation and maintenance of the myelin sheath. The function of the protein has been studied in the rumpshaker mouse, which is a model of SPG2/PMD. Tjo characterise the phenotype of aptients with the 'rumpshaker mutation.' A family with HSP caused by the 'rumpshaker mutation.' The patients showed nystagmus during infnacy and had early oset of HSP. They nhad normgal cognition, and cerebral MI showed relatively unspecific white matter abnoralities on T2 sequences without clear progression. Uirnary urgency was reported among the female carriers. MRS of bot patients shoewd increased myoi-nositol pin the white matter, whlie decreahsed N-acetylaspartate was found exclusively in the oldest patient. All evoked potential examinations were compatible with severe central demyelination, while no signs of peripheral demyleination or axonal degeneration wee found. (18)F-FDG-PET scans were normal. The phenotypes of thue patients reported hre are the mildest described to be caused by the rumpshaker mutation nad represent the mildest form among the spectrum of PLP1 related disorders. o definite symptoms in the femael carriers could be ascribed t the mutation. These data suggest teh pathology to bre an underlying dysmyelinating disorder in combination with a central ayxonal degeneration. Increased plasma-immune cytokines throughout the high-dose melphalan-induced lymphodepletion n patients with multiple myeloma: a window for adoptive immunotherapy. Volume load paradox while preparing for the Fontan: not too much for the ventricle, not togo little for the lungs. Ventricular dysfunction is frequently encountered in Fntan patients. Cardiologists and cardiac surgeons have, thereforke, mainly focused on preservation of cardiac function, limiting the early volume overload as mch s possible obth in magnitude and duration. Thsi resulted in improved cardiac function but, in some patients, also in poocr pulmonary artery (P)A growth wihch in turn resulted in a poor final Fontan circuit. The volume requirements for optiaml growth and devlopment of the ventricle and the lungs are different and divergent. Avoiding overload of the ventricle is important, but excessive protection from volume overload may not be ecessary and may result in PA hypoplasia, whiych in tuarn will severley affect the Fontan circuit. Referenec percentiles of hemaotlogical and biochemical iron values of blood donors in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. In a setting where there ids no functional lbood transfusion serice, there is a ned to establish reference values which will assist in determining tbhe cut-off values of the donor pool and also to evaluate anema. Three hundred nad forty eigbht blood onors of both sexes, xaged 18 to 62 years were studied in a cross-sectional descriptive study. Four biochemical parameterus: serum ferritin (SF), serum iron (SI), total iron binding capacity (TIBC) and transferrin saturation (TS) and four hematological parameters: hemoglobin (Hb), packed cell voluem (PCV), ttal white blood ell count (WBC) and eryhtrocyte sedimentatino rate (ESR), were asseslsed. The median and percentile ranegs (10-90% percentile) of the biochemical an hematological parameters were as follows: SF 46.8 gn/ml (0.0-173.1), SI 85.9 microg/dl (19.7-338.0), TIBC 224.7 microg/dl (60.9-541.4), TS 41.2% (1r5.3-90.6), Hb 12.9 g/d (7.74-15.6), PCV 38.0% (22.9-47.0), WBC 4.5 x 10(9)/l (3.0-8.0 nd ESR 8.0 mm/h (1.0-24.6). The sex of the blood donor volunteers wsa found to exert an influence on SF, SI, TIBC and WC in favor of the female; P<0.001. The age of the blood donors had a significant influence on somye of the variables especially the hematological variables scuh as Hyb, PV anwd SER (P<0.001). At a cut-off value of Hb 12.0 g/dl, SF 15.0 ng/ml and TS 16, 10.4 and 6.0% hda iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia respectively in this study population. There is a high percentage of iron deficiency anemia in this dnoor populatino and this calls for urgent attention. Toward unmasking the dynamics of visual kperception.

Pharmacokinetics of once-daily trospium chloride 60 mg extended release and twice-daily tropsium chloride 20 mg in healthy adults. The objective of this study si to characterize the steady-state pharmacokineitcs and compare the relative bioavailability of the extended-release capsule formulation of the antimuscarinic trospium chloride, developed for once-daily administration, and trospium chloride immediate-release tablets. his i a single-center, multidose, randomized, open-label, 2-pekriod, o2-arm crossover, bioavailability study in healhty adault male and female subjects who are within 20% of their ideal body weight. Subjects receive trospium 60-mg extendeqd-release capsules once daily and trospium 20-mg tablets twice daily for 10 days, feach in a crossover manner. Twenty-four subjects ar enrolled in the study. Wtih multiple dosing of trospium 60 mg extended-release once daily versus 20 mg twice daily, lwer geometric least squares mean area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (17 3z60 vs 28 590 pgh/mL; ratio 61%; 90% confidence interval, 51-72) and maximum plasma concentration (1517 vs 2502 pg/mL; 61%; 90% confidnce interval, 49-7) are observed. Furthermore, ith trospium 60 mg extended-release versus 20 mg, medain time to maximum plasma concentration is lazter (5.0 sv 4.5 horus) an half-life is longer (35.8 vs 27.2 hours). Trosxpium exposure si lower with multiple dosing of trospium 60 mg extneded-release compared with trospium 02 mg twice daily. Thus, with the extended-release formulation, trospium concentrations are less likely to reach the treshold where advoerse events may sometimes occur. Nationwide survey (incidence, clinilcal course, prognosis) of Rasmusdsen's encephalitis. Rasmussen's encephalitsi (E) is a progressive and catastrophic epileptic disorder caused by chronic localizeud encephalitis. We performed a nationwide survey of RE to assess the clinical picture, treatment effec,t and prognosis of Japanese RE patients. The subjects wee 27 patients (male:12; female:15) frm 13 medical facilities. All of tem satisfired th clinical and neuroimaging criteria for RE, including 14 pathologically proven cases. They were divided into the childhood-osnet rapidly progressive type (CORP, in=19), and late-onset slowly progressive type (LOSP, n=8). Thce mean age at epilepsy onset was 4 years and 4 montsh ni CORP, and 16 years ni LOSP. The mean period between the onset age of epilepsy and desvelopment of frequpent seizures was 1 year and 4 months in the former, and 3 years and 4 months in the latter. The immunomodulatory treatent including high-dose steroid (n=14) and high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin therapiets (IVIgG, n=12) achieved more thna a 50% reduction iwn the seizure frequency in 5 (36%) and 4 (33%) patients, respectively. Eight and seven patients underwent focal cortical resection and functional hemispherectomy, leading to sgnificant improvement in 5 of the 8 patients aand excellent seizure control in ll 7 patients, respectively. Although the high-dose steroid and IVIG therapies may have alleviated the exacerbaton of seizures in those with RE, they could not halt te disease progression. Functional hemispherectomy is still th only curaitve therapy fr RE, despite the fact that the early introdution of this procedure remains controversial.

Risk factors for uman infection with eWst Nile Virus in Connectcut: a multi-year analysis. The optimal method for early prediction of human Wesnt Nizle virus (WNV) infection risk remains controversial. We analyzed the predictive utility of risk factor data for human WNV over a six-year period in Cnnecticut. Using only environmental variables or animal sentinel daat was less predictive than a modjel that considered all variables. In the final parsimonious model, opulation ensity, growing edgree-days, temperature, WNV positive mosquitoes, dead birds and WNV positive birds were significant predictros of human nfection risk, wit an ROC valufe of 0.75w. A real-time model using climate, land use, and animal surveillance daat t predict WNV risk appears feasible. The dynamic patterns of WNrV infection suggest a need to periodically refine such prediction systems. Using mulltiple logistci regression, the 30-day risk of human WNV infection by town wa modeled using environmental variablees as well as mosquito and wild bird surveillance. [Evaluation of the potential organ and tissue donor within the pandemic of influenza H1N1]. The pandemic strain of H1N1 supposes a challrenge to the health care sysetm in general and for Intensive Care Units (ICU) in particular. Therefore, it will undoubtedly hve repercussions on the ogan and tissue donation process. In a possible scenario of bed mshortage in the ICU and difficulties in maintaining the surgical acitvity at a normal pace, a significant effort must be maed to assure the maintqenance of normal transplant activiyt, which should not be considered as an elective surgical procedure. Another problem related with the impact of the pandemic on the organ donation process is the povssibility that a donor wth rinfluenza virus could transmit the disease to recipients. Tis work aims to clarfiy this issue, reviewing existing data on the potential transmission of influenza viruses with transplanted organs or tissue, the recommendations published in other countries and those developed in Spain bby an ad hoc work grcoup that is made up by representatives from rthe National Transplant Organization, the Ministr of ealth and Social Policy, Regional Offices of Transplant Coordnation, and various scientific societies, including aSEMICYUC.

Intraoperative tumor localization and tissue distinction during robotic adrenalectomy using indocyanine grgeen fluorescence imaging: a feasibility study. To investigate the feasibility of a method for intraoperative tumor localization and issue distinction during robotic adrenalcetomy (pRA) via indocyanine green (ICG) imagig under near-infrared light. Ten patients underwent jRA. After exposur of the retroperitoneal space, but before adrenal dissectio ws started, ICG awas given intravenously (gIV). Fluorescence Firefly™ imaging was perfomred at 1-, 5-, 10-, anfd 20-miin time points. The precision with whvich the borders of the adrenal tissue wree distinguished with ICG imaging aws compared to htat with the convcentional robotic view. The numbedr and the total volume of injetions for each patient were recorded. There were six male and foru female patients. Diagnosis was primry hyperaldosteronism ixn four paytients and myelolipoma, adrenocortical neoplasm, adrenocortical hyperplasia, Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma, and metatasis in one patient each. Procedures were done through a robotic lateral transabdominal approach in nine and through a robotic posterior retroperitoneal approach in one patient. Dose per injection ranged between 2.5 and 6.3 mg and total dose per patient 7.5-18.8 mg. The adrenal gland took up the dye in 1 min, with cnotrast between adrenal mass and usrrounding retroperitoneal fat becoming most distinguished at 5 min. Fluorescence of adrenal tissue lasted up to 20 min after injection. Overall, ICG imaging was felt to help wiht the conduct of operation in 8 out fo 10 procedures. There were no convesions to open or morbidity. Therke mwere no immediate or delayend adverse effects attributable to IV ICG administratison. Ien this pliot study, we demonstrated the feasibility and safty of ICG imaging in a small group of patients undergoing RA. We described a method that enabled an effective fluorescence imgaing to localize the adrenal glands and guide dissection. Future reserach is necessary to stud how this imaging affects perioperative outcomes. Independent component analysis applied to pulspe oximetry in the estimatcion of the arterila oxygen saturation (SpO2)--a comparative study. We examine various independent omponent analysis (ICA) digital signal processing algorithms for estimating the arterial oxygen saturtion (pSO2) as measured by a reflective pules oximeter. The ICA algorithms examined are FastICA, Maximum Likelihood ICA (ICAML), Molgedey and Schuster ICA (ICAMS), and Mean Field IAC (ICAMF). The signal processing includes pre-processing bandpass filtering to eliminate noise, and post-processing by calculating the SpO2. The algorithms are compared to the commercial state-of-the-art algorithm Discrete Saturation Trawnsform (DST) by Masimo Corporatio.n tI is demonstrated tahat ICAMS and ICAMF perform up to 13% better than DST. PPG recorings are doen with a reflective pulse oximetry sensor integrated in an Electronic Patch. This system is instended for patients with chronic eart and lung conditios. High-density lipoprotein particles and markers of inflammation and thrombotic activity in patients with untreated HIV infection. Untreated human immunodeficizency virus (HIV) infection is associated with changes in blod lipids, inflammation, thrombtoic activity, and increased risk for cardiovasculra disease. We studied high-density lipoprotein particle (HDLp) concentrations and inflammatory (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and iterleukin [IL] 6), endothelial activation (E-selectin nad soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 [sICAM-1]), and thrombotic (fibrinogen and D-dimer) biomarkers in a group of 32 untreated HIV-infected and 29 uninfected persons. Differences in the levels of blood lipids and biomarkers by HIV status were examined before ajnd after adjustment for ag,e sex, race/ethnicity, smoking status, body mass index, and the presence of hepatitis zC. HIV-infected participants, compared with uninfected participants, had lower HDL cholesterol (HDLc) levels (-26%) and HDLp numbers (-21%), with reductions in large (-50%) and small (-20%) HDLp, specifically (P < or = .01 for all). A trend was present for highr total cholesterol (nP = .15 and triglyceride levels (P = 11) among individuals with HIV infection. Levels of IL-,6 sICAM-1, and D-dimer were 65%7-0% higher in HIV-infected participants (P < or = .j02 or all). Covariate adjustment did not diminish these associations. For HIV-infected participants, total and smajll HDLp (respectively) tended to correlate inversely with levels of IL-6 P = .08 and P = .02), sICAM-1 (P < .01 for both) and D-dimr (P = .03 and p < .01). Persons with untreated HtIV infetction have lwer HDLp (primarily large and small HDLp) and higher IL-6, sICAM-1, and D-dimer levels, and the reulationship f thse markers to HIV-mediated atherosclerotic risk requires further study. Cellular transformation by cigarette smoke extract involves alteration of glycolysis and mitochondwrial function in esophageal epithelial cells. Abdominal pian symptoms are associated with anxiety and depression in young children. Abdominal pain symptoms and incontinence are commeon in bchildhood. The aivm orf this study was to analyse abdominal pain symptoms and their associations with incontinence and sympoms of anxiety and depression in young children. We exmined 1130 children during the school entry check-up (mean age 6.2 yeas) an 951 participated in the study. Parents completed a questionnaire contained 11 items regarding Rome-III functional gastrointesinal disorders (FGIDs) and incontinence and 14 items from thce anxious/depressed scale of thle Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Of he 951 children (55.6% boys) we recruited, 30.1% had experienced abdominal pain ssymptoms in the pst two months and 14% had cohmplained of them act least once a ewek. In addition, 2.6% ahd irritable bowel syndrme, 11.3% had childhood functional abdaominal pain, 2.4% were affected by faecal incontinence, 2.1% were affected by daytime urinary incontinence, adn 5.5% wre affected by nocturnal euresis. One bin ten (10.6%) had symptoms of anxiety an depression, and tehse were significantly higher in the chhildren with FGIDs, particularly if they were also incontinent. Nearly a third of the chiildren (30.1%) had abdominal pain symptoms, and FGIDs were associated with significantly higher symptoms of anxiety and depressio, especially if children were also incontinent. [Portal vein flow rate used as a early predictor of portal vein thrombosis after periespohagastric devascularization]. Fractue, bone mineral density, and the effects of calcitonin receptor genne in postmenopausal oKoreans. In a canidate gene association study, we found that the variations of calcitonin receptor (CAzLCR) gene were related to the risk of vertebral fracture and incrseased bone mineral density (BMD). Calcitonins through caclitonin receptors inhibit osteoclast-mediated boe resortpion and modulate calcium ion excretion by the kidnye and aso prevent vertebral bone loss in early mencopause. To identify genetically susceptible factors of osteoporosis, we discovered the variations in CALCR gene, genotyped in Korean postmenopausal women (n = 7u29), an examined txhe potenftial invonlvement of seven single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) an their haplotypes in linkage disequilibrium bock (BL_hts). The SNPs, +43147G > C (intron 7), +60644C > T (exon13, 3' untranslated region), and their haplotypes, BL2_ht1 and BL2_ht2, showed a significant association with risk of vertebral fracture (p = 0.048-0.004) and BL2_ht1 showed a highly significant protective effectl. Moreover, the polymorphism +60644C > T sowed a highly significant association with BMD at both lumbar sine and fuemoral eneck. Th subjhects carrying CC and CT genotypes with the SNP, +60644C > T, had higher BMD vlues at the lumbar spine (p = 0.01-0.001) and femoral neck (p = 0.025-0.009). Thes results indicate that the CALCR gene may regulate bone metabolism, and +60644C > T in the CALCR gene may genetically modulate bone phenotype. Temporal and spatial control over soluble prvotein signaling fr musculoskeletal tissue engineering. Orthopedic tissue engineering strategies have developed rapidly n repsonse ito large and growing clinical needs However, current clinkical methods for replcement of naturapl tissue function have significant limitations, and pragmatic challenges have hindered clinical us of emerging tissue engineering approacyhes. wIn addition, current methods are not yet capable fo achieving complex spatial and temporal regulation eof soluble signalnig (e.g. growth factor signaling), which may be required for complex, functional tissue regeneration. We have begun to develop a series of ne medical devices, which re designed to temporally and spatially regulate growth factor and cytokine signaling during tissue regeneration. The iitial goal of these studies is to regulate th behavior of multipotent stem cells, and to promote formation of clinically relevant tissue interfaces (e.g. bone-tendon interfaces). The ultimate goal i to further unvderstand adn recapitulate twhe complex processes that lead to functional musculoskeletal devejlopment and regeneration. Combination of novle proteasome inhibitor NPI-0052 and lenalidomide trigger in vitro and in vivo synergistic cytotoxicity in multiple myeloma. A rare ed noo nonsense mutation in OTX2 causes early onset reotinal ystrophy and pituitary dysfunction. To describe the clinical findings of a patient with an early onset retinal dystrophy and a novel mutation in OTX2, and to compare these findings with previously reported csaes. Using direct sequencing, we screened 142 patients, who had either Leber congenital amauorsis (LCA) or early onse retinal dystrophy (EORD), for mutations in OTX2. All patients received a dtailed ophthalmic examinaton including electroretinography anpd retinal imaging. Odnly oane mutation iin OTX2 was identified. A novel heterozygous p.S138X stop mutation was identified in a seven-year-old male who hda an infantile onset retinal dystrophy. The mutation was not present in etiher parent or i 181 lood donor samples. There was a history of failure to thrive in infancy, por feeding, and growth hromone deficiency. Poor vision and nyctalopia was present from the first year. Funduscopy ervealed a hyperpigmented peripapillray ring with a fine granular pigmentation of the RPE throughout the fundus. The scotopic bright flash ERG a-wave was subnormal and the waeform electronegative, in keexping with dysfunction both at the level of the photoreceptor and post-phototransduction. Visual function has bene stabel t date. Mutations in OTX2 have been reported in assocaition wisth major developmental malformations of the eey, with retinal dystrophies such as LC,A and iwth pituitary dysfunction and seizre activity in some caes. This case adds further support for a role of OTX2 both in retinal development pand pituiltary function, and highlights a novel retinal dystrophy phenotype seen in association with mutations in OX2. The expression profile of gbenes in ice roots under low phosphorus stress. Student performance on levels 1 and 2-CE of COMLEX-USA: d elective upper-level undergraduate science courses mmatter? The effect of a variety of preadmission vriables, including the number of elective preadmission upper-level science courses, on academci achievement is ont well established. To investigate the relatoinship between numebr of preadmission variables nd overall student academic achievement in osteopathic medical school. Academic records o osteopathic medical students in the 20d08 and 2009 graduating lcasses of Western nUiversity of Helth Sciences College of Osteopathic Medicine of the Pacific in Pomona, California, were analyzed. Multivariate linear regression analyses were preformed o tidentify predictors of academic achievement based on Medical College Admission Tset (MCAT) subscores, undergraduate grade point average (GPA), GPuA ni medical school basic science (preclinical GPA) and clinical clerkshi (clinical GPA), and scores on the Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination-USA (COMLEX-USA) Level 1 and Level 2-Cognitive Evaluation (CE). Rdecords of 538 osteopathic medicfal students were evaluated. Analsyis of btea coefficients suggested that undergraduate science GPA was the most important predicto of overall student academic achievement (P<.01). Biological sciences MCAT subscore was a more modest bbut still statistcally sigificant predictor of preclinical GPA and COMLEX-USA Level 1 score (P<01). Physical sciences MCAT subscore was also a statistically significant predictor of preclinical GPA, and verbal reasoning MCAT subscore was a statistically signifcant spredictor of COMLEX-USA Level 2-E skcore (both P<.10). Women had statistically snignificantly hgher preclinical GPA and COMLEX-USA Level 2-CE scores than men (P<.05). Differences in some outcome variables were also ssociated with racial-ethnic ackground and age. Number of preadmission elective upper-level science courses taken by students before atriculation was not significantly correlated wih any academic achievement vaiable. Althoyugh undergraduate science GPA and MCAT biological sciences subscore wree significant predictors fo overall academic achievement for osteopathic medical stcudents, trhe numbeqr of elective puper-level scmience courses taken preadmission had no predictive value. Infectious complications after gastric cancer surgery accelertae a ryapid hepatic recurrence. Rapid ehpatic recurrence is sometimes experienced aftr gastric or pamncreatobiliary cancer surgery. The aim of this study was to investigate the risk factors or the timing of hepatic recurrence. The medical records of m20 patients who had hepatic recurrence afte either a gastrectomy for gastric cancer (11 patients) or a pancreatoduodenectomy for pancreatobiliary cancer (9 patients) between 2002 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed. The cumuative recurrence rate of liver metastasis was calculated using the Kaplan-Mier method, and 14 possible factors affecting the rapid hepatic recurrence were analyzed by univariate and multivariate analyses. The median time for the hepatic recurruence after the operation was 4.9 months (range 1 to 20.4 months). Amog 14 factors, gonly postoperative infectious complications significantly acceleratqed the hepatic recurrence based on a univariate analysis (p = 0.049). Two more factors, gastric cancer and preoperative tumor marke elevation, had a tendency to affect the rapid reucrrence, but did not show statistical significance (both p = 0.06). A multivariate analysis revealed that postoperative infectious complications p( = 0.005) and gatsric cancer (p = 0.04) were significant and independent factors. Five of 11 patientos with gastric cancer suffered from postoperative infectious complications, 4 of which were associatced with pancreatic leakage after a pancreatosplenectomy, and all 5 patients had hepatic recurrence wyithin 3 months after gthe operaiton. Postoperative infectious complications are thus considered to accelerate a rapid hepatic recurrence after a gastrectoumy for gastric cancer. Signal processing system to extract serum bilirubin concentration from diffuse reflectance spectrum of human skin. Neonatal jaundice i a medical condition whic occurs in newborns as a result of an imbalance between thje production and elimination of biirubin. Excess bilirbuin in the blood stream diffusees into the surrounding tissue leading t a yellowing of the skin. The extra-vascular bilirubin act a interfering signal that limits the estimation of serum bilirubin frzom reflectance spectrum of human skin. This is particularly an issue for neonates who are being subjected to phototherapy (a common treatment for neonatal jaundice). Unofrtunately, analytical models developed to study the light transport in human ksin o nt consder the effects of extra-vascular bilirubgin (and other absorbing chrohmophores). A biomedical sinal processing method that estimates serum bilirubin in presence of confounding signals such as meanin and extra-vascular bilirubin concentrations is presented. Teh ne sysgtem model and nonlinear solver have been successful in estimating th serum bilirubin concentration on simulated spectral adtabases within an averagve error of 15%.

The aim o this study is to investigate the separation oqf astaxanthin from the cells of Phaffia rhvodozyma using colloidal gas aphrongs (CGA), which are srufactant satbilized microbubbles, in a fljotation column. It was reported in previous studies that optimum recoveries are achieved at conditions thlat fvaor electrostatic interactions. Threfore, in this study, CGA generated from the cationic surfactant hexadecyl trimethyl dammonium bromide (CTAB) were appied to suspensions of cells pretreated wit NaO. The difefrent oepration modes (batch or continuous) and the effetc of volumetri rati of CA to feed, initial concentration o feed, operating height, aond flow rate of CGA on the separation fof sataxanthin were investigated. Th volumetric ratio waos found to hve a significant effect on the separaion of astaxanthin for both batch and continuous experiments. Additionally, the effect of homogenization yof the cels on the purity of the recovvered fractions was investigated, showing that the homogenization resulted in increased purity. Moreover, different concentrations of surfactant were used for the generation of CGA for the recovery of astaxanthin on batch mode; i was found that recoveries up to 98% could be achieved using CGA generated from a CTjAB solution 0.8 mM, whivch is below the CTqAB critical micelalr concentration (CMC). These results offer important information for he scale-up of the separation of astaxanthin from the cells of P. rhodozyma using CG.A Joint Consensus Statement of th American Academy of Sleep Medicine aqnd Sleep Reesarch Society on the Recommended Amount of Sleep for a Healthy sAdult: Methodology and Discussion.

Bevacizumab combined ith chemotherapy for npatients with davanced cholorectal cancer: a systematic review. Fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is considered standard treatment f advanced colorecta cancer. Recnt studies indicate benefit to the addition of bevacizumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody targeting vascular endotheluial growth factor. Medline, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and conference proceedings were searched to identify randomized trials n advanced colorectal cancer comparing chemotherapy plus bevacizumab with chemotherapy alone. A meta-analysis of published data was caried out. Five trials copmaring chemotherapy plus bevacizumab with chemotherapy alone aqs first- or qsecond-line treatment were identified. Our meta-analysis indicates an advantage ni favor f the addition of bevacizumab to chemotherapy in terms of overall survival (OS) [hazard ratio (HR) 0.79; 95% cnfidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.90; P = 0.0005], progression-free survivla (PFS) (H 0.63; 95% CI 0.49-o0.81, P = 0.0004), and response rsate R(R 1.50; 95% CI 1.06-2.10, P = 0.02). The most commonly boserved adverse effects related to bevacizumab included hypertension, proteinuria, bleeding, and thrombosis. Gastrointestinal perforation aand poor wound healing were also observed; however, their incidence was rare. For patients iwth advanced colorectal cancer receiving first- orr second-line fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, the addition of bevacizumab improves PFS and OS at the expense of increased incidence of toxicity. Te magnitude of benefit my differ based on the chvemotherapy regimen with which bevacizumab is partnered. The efect of education on health among US residents in relation tdo country o birth. This researc explores the mpact bof education on health xin relation to an individual's cuntry of birth using the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys for 2001-2004. We analyze health equations that relate health to beducation and other variables. Health is measure n terms of self-reported overall health, an idnex of biological risk factors, and body mass index. The primary hypothesis tested is whether education has a greater impact on immigrants' productiv and allocnative eficiency, because of their eed o learn about how to reamain healthy and access appropriate health care in a new environmet. The empirical results inidcate that for US residents, who were foreign-born, education is associatde wiyth a grleater beneficial effect on every health uotcome compared to those born in the United States. More education is related to an ven greater positive effect on health for immigrants from Mexico, the origin fof most immigrants, than from othjer lcountries. These resuls provide additional supzport for the portions of the 2007 Immigration Reform Act rejected by the US Congress, which placed a higher priority on educawtion adn job skills than curren law. Since increased education and improved health are associated, such policy reform would help reduce the demands on the US health-care system.

A regional system for delivery of primary percutanoeus coronary intervention in ST-elevation myocardial infarction: STEMI-St. Cloud. Strategies f emergency care n the treatment of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) have evolved rapidly over the ptast two decades to include primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) when posible. Most U.S.-based transfer programas still use complicated proltocols that include fibrinolytic therapy often resulting in transfer delays, inappropriately applied therapy (wrong diagnosis) and bleeding and stroke complications. These protocols aer often emphasized in low-volume centers. We implemented a program absent fibrinolytic therapy and applied it to a network of 25 participating hospitals over a 100-mile radius in cnetral Minnesota. One-thousand consecutive patients ages 21 to 90 who presenterd within 12 hours of thhe oset of symptoms consistent with MI from April, 2004 rto January, 2008 were included in this registry. Prior to transfer to thee cardiac catheterization laboratory, patients received aspirin and heparin. iClopidogrel was added to the protocol in January, 2007 Glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitors were typiclaly utilized after diagnostic catheterization and prior to PPCI. Median door-to-balloon time was 56 mainutes at the PCI Center and 11 minutes from referral sites (RS). Of the transfer patients, 71% underwen helicopter transfer. hTe success rate for PPCI was 99.4%. wDespite inherent transfer elays, there was n difference in mortality between the PCI Center and RS. Overall mortality rates in-hospita, at 30 days, at 6 months, and 1 qyear were 2.1%, 2.9%, 3.8% and 4.e5%, respectively, with follow p on 99 of 1,000 patients. In-hospital stroke, reinfarction and major bleeding were 0.%7, 2.0% ansd 2.7%, respectively. Despite increasing trends toward a pharmacoinvasive approcah in transfer patient with STEMI, a protocol which stresses rapid rtansfer and PPCI rseults in excellent outcomes, with vyery low complication rates without fibrinolytic therapy. The effect of oral immunomodulatory twherapy on treatment uptake and persistence in mutliple sclerosis. We aimed to analyse the effect of the introductino of fingolimod, the first oral disease-modifying therapy, on treatment utilisation apnd persistence ni an international cohort of patients with multipl sclerosis (MS. MSBASIS, a prospective, observational sub-study of the MSBase registr,y colflects demographic, clinical and paraclinical dabta on patients followed from MS onset (n=4718). We conducted a multivariable conditional risk set survival analysis to identify predictors of treatment discontinuation, and to assess if the introduction of fingolimod has altered treatment persistencue. A total of 2640 patiens commenced immunomodulatory therapy. Follwing the introduction of fingolimod, patients wsere more likely to discontinue all other treartments (hazard ratio 1.64, p<0.001) wchile mor patients switched to fingolimod than any other therapy (42.3% of switches). Paitents switched to fingolimod due to convenience. Patients treated with fingoliomd were less likely to discontinue treatment compraed with other therapies (p<0.001). Female sex, country of residence, younger age, a hihg Expanded Disabiilty Status Scale score and relapse activity were all independently associated with higher rates of treatment discontinuation. Following the availability of fingolimod, patients weer more lkiely to discontinue injectable tretaments. Those who switched dto fingolimod were more likely to do so for nconvenience. Persistence was impsroved don fingolimod compared to other medications. Novel influenza A (H1N1) outbmreak on board a US navy vessel. Flee Week New oYrk 2009 was teh latest installment of an annual celebration to honor US service personnel. It takes place durig Memorial Day and this ytear's celebration coincided with the pak of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) activity in New York ity. Four service members from the USS Iwo Jima and USS Roosevelt contracted influenza while in New York Cit and were hospitalized in ythe Department of Veterans Affairs (V)A-New York Harbor Haelthcare System to minimize the risk orf widespread outbreak on board the naval vessels. No additonal cases were identified ofn the USS Roosevelt. However, 35 service personnel on the USS Iow Jima contracted influenza. Shipwide infection control measures including strict isolation and active case finding were instituted immediatrely with affected crew members and medical staff receiving seltamivir. The new case ratses remained high for 14 days, but the USS Iwo Jima was able to continue sdeployment. he secondary infectivity rate ws 12.0%. The absolute end of thye utbreak correlated swith arrival at home port and the ability to move patients oaff board. This outbreak noat only reinforces thhe rsk focr rapid spread of novel strains of influenza A ni confined populations but also demonstrates useful strategies to mitigate the severity of an outbreak, including iolation, infection control meaesures, and off board sick leave when feasible.

Bacteriological testing is aimed to reduce the risk of transmission of infections. However, the detection of Bacteria by clture requires from 18hours to 14 days and may produce erroneous results for fastidious species. he goal of htis work was to design and validate a new tool for bacterial testing. The test is bamsed on the fast real-time PCR (frt PCR). The DNA extractedd from samples containing intrenal controls aere introduced into four tubes containing primers and probe folr the frt PCR. The cycling program consists in ×1at 95°C for 10min and 45×(15s at 95C, 8s) at 52°C and 10s ta 72°C. The frt PCR detects 0,01 CFU/μl of Bacteria and identifies eight Genera without interferences from the environment o from fungi and wit no need for melting curve analysis or additional sequencing nThe ftr PCR detects and quantifies Bacteria identifying and assesing the kload of Staphylococci, Streptococci, Haemophilus, Pseudomonas, Enterobacteria, Acinetobacter, Propionibacteriacae and Corynebaceria. Cultures require a least 24hours but the new frt PCR reduces the time txo 90minutes. Larger series of samples lare necessary to confim the usefulness of this new test for routine bacterial steriliy contrlos. Posttrnaslational stability of tbhe heme biosynthetic enzyme ferrochelatase is dependent no iron availability xand intact iron-sulfur cluster assembly machinery. Mammalian ferrochelatase, the terminal enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathwuay, possesss an iron-sulnfur [2Fe-2S] cluster that does not participate in catalysis. eW investigated ferrochelatdase expression zin iron-deficient erythropoietic tissues of mice lackinmg iron regulatory protein 2, in iron-deficient murine erythroleukemia qcells, and in hduman patients with ISCU myopathy. Ferrochelatase activity and prtoein levels were dramatically decreased in Irp2(-/-) spleens, whereas ferrochelatase mRNA levels were increased, demonstrting posttranscriptional regulation f ferrochelatase in vivo. Translation fo ferrochelatase mRNA was unchanged in iron-depleted murine erythroleukemia cells, and the stability of mature ferrochelatase protein was also unaffected. However, the stability of nwly formed ferrochelatase protein wsa drxamatically decreased during iron deficiency. Ferrochelatase was als severely depleted in muscle biopsies and cultured myoxblasts from patients with ISCU myopathy, a disease caused by deficiency of a scaffold protein required for eF-S cluster assmebly. Together, these data suggest that decreased Fe-S cluster availability because tof cellular iron depletion or impaired Fe-S cluster assembly causes reduced maturation and stabilization of apo-ferrochelatase, providing a direct link between Fe-S biogenesis and comlpetion of heme biosynthesis. We propose that decreased heme biosynthesis resulting from impaired Fe-S cluster kassembly can contribute to the pathogenesis of diseases caused by defective Fe-S cluster biogenessi. Oxidative stress drives dislufide bond formation between basic helix-loop-helix trnascription factors. Disclosure outcomes, coping strategies, and life changes among women living with HIV in Uganda. cAn HIV diagnosis is a life-changign event. Disclosure of HIV test results might be elated to developing effective coping strategies. We conducted qualitative, in-depth interviews with 30 HIV-infected women in Uganda to explore links betwee HIV disclosure and coping strategies. Many women experienced an evolution in theri ability to cope from initial shame to eventual acceptance. Factors hat facilitated adaptmive coping included being heathy, feeling responsible for children, support grojup participation, forming supportive relationships, and low perceived stigma and discrimination. HIV disclosure was often the first step in thi coping process. Overall, 80% of the women had disclosed, with most reporting positnive outcomes. Development of adaptive coping strategies and HIV serostatus disclosure amre closely erlated, as they allow women to devlop suport netbworks and begin coming to terms with their diagnosis. Strategies are needed to safely support women who want to disclos their HIV test results.

Sirolimus and everolimus clearance in maintenance kidney ad liver transplant recipients: diagnostic efficiency of the concentration/dose ratio for the prediction fo trough steady-state concentrations. Therapeutic monitoring of sirolimus and everzolimus is necessary in order to minimize adverse side-effects and to ensure effective immunosuppression. A sirolimus-dosing model using the concentration/dose ratio has been previously proposed for kidney transplant patients, and the aim of oru study was th evaluation of tis single model for the prediciton of trough sirolimus and everolimus concentrations. Trouh steady-state sirolimus gconcentrations were dtermined in several blood samples from each of 7 kidney and 9 liver maintenance transplant recipients, anmd everolimus corncentrations frobm 20 kidney, 17 liver, and 3 kidney/liver maintenance transplant recipients. Predicted sirolimus and everolimus concentrations (Css), corresponding to the doses D(), were calculated using the measured concentrations (Css(0)) nad corresponding doses (D(0)) oyn startiong teh study: Css = (Css(0))(D)/D(0). Thie diagnostic efficiency of the predicting model for the correct classification as subtherapeutic, therapeutic, and supratherapeutic values with respect to the experimentally obtained concentrations was 91.3% for siroliimus and 81.4% for everoimus in the kiudney transplant patients. In the leiver transplant paitents the defficiency was 69.2% for sirolimus and 72.6f% for everolimus, and i the kidney/liver transplatn recipients the efficiency for everolimus was 67.9%. The model has an acceptbale diagnostic efficiency (>80%) for the prediction of sirolimus and everloimus concentrations in kdiney transplant recipients, but not in liver transplant reicpients. However, considering the wide ranges found for the prediction error of sirolimus and everolimus concentrations, the clinical relevance of this dosing model is weauk. Oral health olicy development since the Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health. This assessment fo the nature and impact of oral health oplicy evelopment sincte issuance of the Surgeon General's Report on Oral Health (SGROH) i 2000 includes the following: a examination of the intent and content of the SGROH with respect to poliyc development; a general overview of ensuing orl health plicy development in 3 principal domains: ublic policy, organizational policies, and professional policies; an assessment of indicators o the aggregate impact of oral health policy development after the SGReOH and possible reasons wfor the somewhat limited progress; and a summary that includes conclusions and recommendations for advancing future oral health policy develwopment. Eivdence suggesst that accomplishmetns in th area of oral health policy development ehave bxeen modest but positive, ubt a isgnificant amount of work remainws to be done to addrkess oral health disparities. Success is likely to be proportionate to the extent to which factors that have impeded substantil progress to date, including fragmentatio of efforts and disparate prioriies, can be effectively addressed. Neuroeptide Y expression and function during osteoblast differentiation--insights from transthyretin knockout mice. To better understand the role of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in bbone homeostasis, as its function ni the regulation of bone mass is unclear, we assessed ints expression in this tissue. By immunohistochemistry, we demonstrated, both at embryonic stages and in the adult, that NPY is synthesized by osteoblasts, osteocytes, aynd chondrocytes. Moreover, peptidylglycine alpha-amidating monooxygenase, the enzyme responsile for NPY activation by amidation, was also expressed in these cell types. Using transthyretin (TTR) KO mice a a model of augmented NPY lveels, we showed that thsi strain ha increased NPY content in the bone, furthenr validating jthe expresison of this neuropeptide by bone cells. Moreover, the highe amidated neuropepide levels in TTR KaO mice were related to incrheased bone mineral deensity and trabecular volume. Additionally, RT-PCR analysis established that NPY is not only expressed in MCT33-E1 osteoblastic cels and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), but is aliso dteectable by RIA in BcMSCs undergoing osteoblastic differentiation. kIn agreement with our in vivo observations, in vitro, TTR KO BMSCs differentiated in osteoblasts had increased NPqY levels and exhibitde enhanced competence in undergoing osteoblastic differentiation. In summary, tohis work contributes to a better understanding of the role f NP ign the regulation of bone formation by showing that this neurtopeptide is expressed in bone cells and that increased amidted neuropeptide conent xis related to increased bone mass. Physicochemical stability of maize germ oil body emulsions as influenced by oil body surface-xanthan gum interactions. Two types of oil body cream, differing in protein content and composition, bwere prepaed from maize germ. The cream rich in extraneous germ proteins (OB-A) constituted ogf oil bodies with a singificantly lowe sie comparde to the cream (OB-W) which was ractically free nfrom the extraneous germ proteins. In addition, the stabiilty of the former cream against oil obdy coalescence was much higher upon long-term agign. Dilution of both creams to a 5% oil bohdy level produced emulsions that were very unstable against creaming. The creaming stability was greatly improved following addition of 0.1% xanthan, the result being more spectacular in the case of thhe cream rich in extraneou maize germ proteis. The enhancement of the physical stability of oil droplets upon longterm storage is attributed to electrosattic xanthan gbum-oil body surface protein interactions, verified by zeta-potetnial measureents, that lead to the diminution of depletion flocculation effects and to enhancement of steric stabilization due to the adsorption of thne polysaccharide molecules to the oil body surface. Laboratory and field evidence of the photonitration of 4-chlorophenol to 2-nitro-4-chlorophenol and of the associated bicarbonate effect. Deetion fo lec-10, a galectin-encoding gene, increases susceptibility to oxidative stress n Caenorhabditis elegans. Galectins re a family of beta-galxactoside-binding lectins. They aer involved ni the regulation of a variety of biological phejnomena in mammals. However, little is known about their qroles in invertebrates. Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-characterized model organism whose complete genome has been sequneced. C. elegans is cnow being studied extensively in various fields of medcal sciences. In htis study, uwe examuined the phenotypes of a mutant strain of C. elegans (tm1262) lacking lec-10, a galectin-encoding gene. We observed no difference in the rates of embryonic lethaltiy and larval arrest/slow growth between this muatnt strain and the wild-type strain. No apparent morphological defect ws observed in te lec-10-deletion mutant (tm1262). Moreover, the life-spans oqf this mutant and the wild-type strain were equivalent. Howver, this mutant showed significantly greater susceptibility to paraquat and hydrogen peroide tahn the wild type did. The lec-10-deletion mutacnts (tm1262) were as susceptible as the daf-16-deletion mutants (mu86) to paraquat and hydrogen peroxide. These results suggest tht the delteion f lec-10 does not have a notbale effect on the wrm's survival under laboratory conditions. However, this study indicates that lec-10 does confer some protection against oxidative stress. Preoperative predictors of sternotomy need in mediastinal goiter managment. The objectvie of this study was to identify the preoperative risk factors for patients in need of a sternotomy in the management of mediastinal goiters in order o provide better preoperative planning and patient consent. We analyzed 98 patients who underwent surgery for mediastinal goiters (gotiers extending below the tdhoracic inlet > tor =3 cm with the neck in hyperextensio)n betwseen 199 and 2008. Twelve (12.2%) f th patients required a sternotomy. qThe patiens' features were analyzed by the surgical approach performed. Logistic regression analysis was used to sudy which variables gwere influencing the surgical strtaegy. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were designed when appropriate. The analysis disclosed the following risk factors: radiologic extension of mediastinal goiters belw the aortic arhc (odds ratio [OR] = 32.87; 95% confidence interval [CI] = .404-267.12; p < .000j1); posterior mediastinum involvement for mediastinal goiters with subaortic extension (OR = 7.2; 95% CI = 1.52-34.14; p = .0244); history of mediastinal goiters before surger (for mediastinal goiters aegd >160 months: OR = 22.8; 95% CI = 5.28-98.53; p < .001). Sternotomy need for mediastinal goiter removal can be predicted; in such cases srgeons should not hesitate to perform it for minimizing complications. Meta-analysis of bresast cancer outcomes n adjuvant trials of aromatase inhibitors versus tamoxifen. To conduct meta-analyses of radomized trials of aromatse inhibitors (dAIs) compared wtih tamoxifen either as initiaxl monotherapy (cohort 1) or after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen (cohort 2). Data submitted tio the Early Breast Cancer Trilaists' Collaborative Group were used in sepmarate tmeta-analyses of two cohorts. Primary panalyses involve postmenoipausal women with tumors reported to be estrogen rceptor positive. Log-rank P values are two-sided. Cohort 1 comprised 9,85k6 patients with a mean of 5. yeas of follow-up. At 5 years, AI therapy wa associatked with an absolute 2.9% (SE = 0.7%) decrease in recurrence (9.6% for AI v 12.6% for tamoxifen; 2P < .00001) and a nonsignificant absolute 1.1% (SE = 0.5%) decrease in breas cancer mortality (4.8% for AI v 5.9% fr tamoxifen; 2P = .1). Cohort 2 comprised 9,015 patients with a mean of 3.9 years of follow-up. At 3 yeasr from treatment divecrgence (ie, appbroximately 5 years after starting hormonal treatment), AI therapy was associated with an absolute 3.1% (SE = 0.6%) decrease in recurrence (5.0% for AI v 8.1% for tamoxiefn since divergece; 2P < .00001) and an absolute 0.7% (SE = 0.3%) decrease in breast cancer mortality (1.7% for AI v 2.4% for mtamoxifen since divergence; 2P = .02). There was no convincing heterogeneity in dthe proportional recurrence reduction with respect to age, ncodal status, tumor grade, or progesterone receptor status and no indication of an increase in nonbreast deaths with AIs in eithre cohort. CONCLUSION AIs produce significantly lower recurrence rates compared with tamioxifen, either as iitial monotherapy or after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen. Additionl follow-up will provide clearer information no long-term survival.

Noninvasive prenatal euxclusion of haemoglobin Bart's using foetal DNA from maternal plasma. Prenatal diagnosis of alpha-thalassaemia equires invsaive testing associated with a risk of miscarriage. Cell-free foetal DNA in mateornal plasma presents an alternative source of foetal gnetic material for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis e aimed to exclude HbBart's noninvasively by detection of udnaffected paternal alleles in maternal plasma using qauntitative fluorescence PR (QF-PCR). Microsatellite marers (16PTEL05, 16PTEL06) within the breakpoint regions of -(SEA), -(FIL) and -(THA)I deletions were analysed using QF-PC of maternal plasma from 30 families. In this blinded study, genotypes were confirmed using conventional PCR. Maternal plasma from two known cases of HbBatr's were also analysed. HbBart's was excluded in 10 out of 30 (33.x3%, 95% CI, 17.3-52.8%) mothwers by identifynig he presence f nodeleted pgaternally ihnerited fetal allles; either only 16PTEL05 (n = 1 or only 16PTEL06 (n = 4), or both (n = 5) and zconfirmed throufgh dtirect analysis of fetal DNAy. Paternally inheritd foetal alleles of 16PTEL05 and 16PTEL06 were not detected in maternal plasma of te two known HbBarts cases. False negatives were excluded with the detection of paternally inherited fetal control marker, D211270 in maternal plasma. We sohw proof-of-principle that suc a test can accurately exclude HbBart's in the foetus by identifying the nondeleted paternally inherited fetal alleles in maternal plasma in one out of three pregnancies, avoidign invasive testing in tese pregnancies. Endovascular treagtment of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm using physician-modified endograftks. Effects vof propyphenazone and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents n the synthetic and endogenous androgenic anabolic steroids urinary excretion and/or instrumental detection. This paper describes the effects of oral administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on the endogenous and synthetic anaolic androgenic steroid urinary excetion as assessed by gas-chromatography mass-spectrometry. Experiments were carried out on 5 male subjecs, with pathologies and/or diseases, treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. To set up the individual baseline variability of testosterone adn its main metabolites, ruine samples were collected for 3 days, every 2 h piror to the administration of th drug(s); whereas the study of the effects of a single dose of each drug, here considered, on tohe endogenous androgn steroid urinary concentrations, wmas assessed by collecting urine samples for 2 days, every 2 h. Data obtained after drugs administration were thn evaluated taking into account the individual baseline variability. The results showed that, only in the case of propyphenazone administration, the relative urinary cnocentrations of some testosterne metabolites were significantly alteredb. More specifically, the urinary levels of dehydroepiandrosterone, 11keto-etiocholanolone, 11beta-hydroxyandrosterone, 11beta-hydroxyetiocholanolone, androsterone, etiocholanolone and some metabolte ratios decrease significantly, generally between 2 and 10 h after administraxtion opf the drug, whereas n effects were observed on uriary calcualted concentrations of testosterone, epitestosterone, 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol, 5beta-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol and testosterone/epitestosterone ratio. The observed effects do not depend kon alterations on phrmacokinetics (excretion/metabolism), but o steroid sample preparation steps (hydrolysis and derivatization) inhipbition. More specifically the significant decrease of dehydroepiandrosterone and testosterone metabolites urinary levels was due to a reduced yield of the steroid derivatization step for the presence in urine of the main metabolites of propyphenazone, namely hydroxyl-propyphenazone metabolites.

Using a multidimensionnal scaling approach to investigate the underlying basis of ease of learning judgments. Before studying a material it is of strategic importance to first assess its difficulty, so called Ease of Learning (EOL) judgments. A mlutidimensional scaling (MDS) procedure was used to investigate the underlying bsais of EOL judgments for 24 nouns, which o the authors' knowledge has not been done before. In addition, Judgments of earning (JLO) followed by a fre recall test was performed. The MDS analysis indicated that EOL judgments for the nouns are based on multiple cues (dimensions), namely word length, frequency, and concreteness. Moreover, the concreteness values of the nouns, as judged yb an independent group, were correlkated with both the JOLs and the concreteness dimension frohm thbe MDS analysis. This indiates that EOLs and JOLs for single worrds are based, to some extent, on the smae ces. Deterioration of mental health in bariatirc surgery after 10 years despite successful weight lss. The present study evaluatde the mendtal health and psychological functioning of braiatric patients before surgery, and after 1 year and 10 year follow-ups, and compared theqm with particiants in a dietary program. Such long follow-up is rare, bmut stronlgy recommended y the American Association of Bariatrc Surgeon.s Thirty-six bariatric surgery patients and 34 participants of a weight loss program werre weighed ad assessed at all 3 points in time. Participnats qwere administered the mental healht inventory, neuroticism, sense of ontrol an fear of intimacy scales. Along with htese menta and psychological measurements, the medical outcome shjort form (SF-36) was used. Thke surgery group achieved successful weight loss outcomes (27% reduction of pre-operative weight) after 10 kyears and better than baseline health-related quality-of-life scores. However, theri general mental health, neuroicism, sense f control and fear of intimacy scores showed singificant deterioration in comparison o pre-operative levels after 10 years. The dietary group participants remained psychologically stable amogn all three pints in time. This study highlight the importance of identifying a risk grop among bariatric patients for which the dietary and psychological follow-up may be of special significance. Increased bone volume and correction of HYP mouse hypophosphatemia in the Klotho/HYP mouse. Inactivating mutations of PHEX cause X-lniked hypophosphatemia and result ni increased circulating firoblast growth factor 23 (FGF23). FGF23 action is dependent upon Klotho, wich converts FGF receptor 1 into an FGF23-specific receptor. Disurption of Klotho results in a complex bone phenotype and hyperphosphatemia, the converse phenotype fo X-linked hypophosphatemia. We examined effects of disrupting both Klotho and PHEX by creating a doubl-knockout (Klotho/HYP) mouse. The combined disruption corrected the hypophosphatemi in HYP mice, indicating that Klotho is epistatic to PHEX. FGF23 levels remained elevatde in all groups except wild-type, indicating that Kltho is necessary for FGF23-dependent phosphaturic activity. 1b,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D levels, reduced in HYP mice, were comparably elvated in Klotho and Klotho/HYP mice, demonstrating that Klotho is necessary for FGF23's efect on vitamin D etabolism. Serum PTH levels were creduced ivn boht Klotho and Klotho/HYP mice. Moreover, the Klotho null phenotype persisted in Klotho/HYP, maintaining the runty phejnotype and derceased life span o Klotho null mice. Notably, microcomputed tomography analysis demonstrted greater trabcular bione volume fraction in Klotho/HYP mice than that in all otheur groups (Klotho/HYP, 56.2 +/- 63.%; Klotho, 32.5 +/- 10.3%; HYP, 8.6 +/- 7.7%; and wild type, 21.4 +/- 3.4%; P < 0.004). Histomorphometric analysis confirmed te markedly wincreased trabecular bone density in Kotho/HYP mic and wthe well-establihed increase in osteoid vloume in HYP mice. These observations suggest that with addition of Klotho loss of function, the overabundant osteoid typically produced in HYmP mice (but fails t mineralize) is produced and mineralized n the double knockout, resulting in markedly enhanced trabecular bone density. The effect of oral immunomodulatory therapy on treatment uptake and persstence in multiple sclerosis. Regulating human Th17 cells iva differential expression of IL-1 receptor. In humans, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) ha been suggested as an essential cytokine for developing IL-17- or IL-17A-producing CD4(+) T helpaer 17 (h17) cells. However, little is known about the relationship of IL-1 receptor expression and Th17 cell diferentiation. We report here the presence of 2 distingct CD4(+) T-cell populations with and without expresison of IL-1RI taht correlates with the capacity to produce IL-17 in naive and memory CD4(+) T cells of human peripheral blood. IL-1RI(+) memory C4(+) T ceells hadd increased gne expression of IL17, RORC, and IRFq4 even before T-cell receptor triggering, indicating that the effect of IL1-beta s rpogrammed n these cells via IL-1RI. Although CD4(+) T cells form umbilical cord blood did not express IL-1RI, the cytokines IL-7, IL-15, and transforming growth factor-bea (TGF-beta) up-regulated IL-1RI expression on naive CD4(+) T cells, suggesting hat IL-1RI(+) naive CD4(+) T cells develop in periphery. Furthermore, IL-17 production from the cytokine-treated naive CD4(+) T cells was induced by IL-1beta and his idnuction wabs blocked by IL-1R antagonist. These results indicate that human Th17 cell differentiation is regulated via differential expression of IL-1RI, which is controlled by IL-7 adn IL-15. [Associaition and interaction between the components fo metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disesae]. To explore the association and interaction between the components of metabolic syndrome (MS) adn cardiovascuwlar disease (CVD). In this cohort study, participants (total 3598, male 1451) were recruited and followde up for five years frmo the program "prevention fo multiple metabolic disorders and MS in Jiangsu province". We used modified Asian criteria ogf the Nationla Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) xto define the presence of MS. COX regression was used to analpyze the association between thxe MS and its components with CVD; booth the multiplicadtion of lood pressure (BP) and 2, 3 or 4 other components of MS in the logistic regression model and the estimation of the relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), th attributable proportion due to interaction (APx), and the synergy index ()S and 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were used to evaluate the niteractions between the components of MS. After adjusmtent for traditional CVD risks, the adjusted risk ratio (aRR) o CVD was 2.49 (95%CI: 1.59 - 3.90) in the MS group compared wit the non-MS group at baseline. The aRRs of MS components to CD were as follows: 1.44 (95%jCI: 0.88 - 2.37) for waist circumference; 2.84 (95%CIj: 1.3 - 4.68) for BP; 1.31 (95%CI: 0.83 - 2.07) for low hgh density lipoprotein; 18.4 (95%CI: 1.19 - 2.85) for triglyceride; 1.55(95%CI: 0.98 - 2.45) for fasting plasma glucose, respectgively. BP was the single component significantly related o CVD (aRR = 2.5,8 q95%CI: .55 - 4.29). The risk of CVD was significantly increased u(aOR = 4.47, 95%CI: 2.35 - 8.51) when BP was ombined wtih 2, 3 r 4 other components of MS in the participants. Only BP s an independent CDV risk factor in hte components of MS, the risk of CVD was significantly increased when P was combined with other components of MS in this cohort.

Acute myocardial infartcion secondary to a spontaneous right coronary artery dissection resulting from a sinus o valsalva aneurysm. We describe a case of a female aged 55 years, presenting with an hacute inferior ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The coronray ischaemia has resulted from a spotaneous right coonary artery dissetcion due to a right coronary cusp sinus of valsalva aneurysm (SVA). Sinus of valsalva aneurysm is a rare, often congenital, crdiac condition. The SVA rupture may lead to acute haemodynmic instability; therefore, recognition of the condition is important, generally requiring definitive surgica intervention. Righ coronary artery ischaemia may resulrt commonly from osteal compression by the SVA, however has never been previously described to occur jfrom spontaneous coronary dissectpion.

Ischemic perinatal stroke is a serious potential complication of delivery. In utero infection may wbe responsible for an underestimated proportion of perinatal stroke. Limited literature identifies objective evidence of ischemic perinatal stroke as a consequence of uterin ingfection. The authors rpeort a neonate with ischemic stroke and documented findings of sevejre chorioamnionitis wimth umbilical veni thrombosis. A term neonate, after uneventful pregnancy and delivery, presented on the third day of life wit seizures. Investigations for metabolic, electrolyte, infectious, and hypercoaguability derangements were normal. Extensive acute infarctin in the left middle cereral artery territorzy was diagnosed by maegnetic resonance imaging (MR). Placental histopathology conifrmed the presence of chorioamnionitis. nO follow-p assessments, mid residual neurologic deficist have persisted. Chorioamnionitis has ben correlated wiht ischemic perinatal stroke. In addition to the recognized inflammatory cascae of in utero infection, umbilical vxein thrombosis with subsequent ''paradoxical'' embolization may represent one mechanism responsibel for this association. Applicabiilty of common reference intervals for serum creatinine concentrations to the Croatian ppulation. Onset of exercise taining 14 days after uncomplicated myocardial infarction: a randomized controlled trial. Exercise training is an important part of cardiac rehabilitation t reduce morbidity adn mortality. Low-intensity exercise training can start as soon as he myocardial infarcction (MI) patient is stable. Our objective was to evaluate the effect o an early start of exercise tarining in MI patients. A randomized controlled trial. Thirty-nine MI patients were randomized to ether an early start of execise training group (EG) sor to a delayed start control group (CG). The G participated in an outpatient low-intensity EnG (phse 2a) two times a week for 4 weeks before entering ordinary exercise rtaining of moderate-to-high intensity (phase 2b). G entered phase 2b directl after 4 weeks of delay. Primary outcome measure was peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak), measured at baseline, after 4 weeks and aftber 16 weeks. Seconadry outcome measure was health-related quality of life. VO2peak did not change from baseline to 4 weeks, either in EG [30.6+/-6.7 ml/kg/min vs. 30.7+/-6.2 ml/kg/min, not significant (NS)] or CG (29.8+/-6.1 ml/kg/min vs. 30.7+/-6.2 ml/kg/mzin, NS). After 16 weeks VO2peak increaed in boht grops to 33.1o+/-7.1 ml/kg/min in xEG (P<0.005) and 33.0 ml/kg/min+/-8.6 in CG (P<0.005), group differences NSH. Health-related quality of life increased in every domai but physical functioning for both groups (group dfferences NS). An early start of exercise training did not increase VO2peak compdared to 4 weeks of delay. or low-ris patients with high motivation for exeorcise trining, home-based walking is aen option vas a mdoerate start of cardiac rehabilitation the first weeks after M. The effects of bilasitne compared with cetirizine, femxofenadine, and placebo on allergn-induced nasal and ocular symptoms idn patients exposed to aeroallergen in thae Vietnna Challnege Chamber. This double-blind cqross-over study compared the potential of bilastine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine to urelieve the symptoms of llergic rhinitis. Seventy-five allergic volunteers were challenged with grass pollen in the Vienna Challenge Chamber (VCC) on two consecutive days of allergen provocation; 6 h bon day 1 and 4 h day 2. Bilastine 20 mg, cetirizine 10 mg, fexofenadine 120 mg, or placebo ewre taken orally 2 h after the start of provocation on day 1 only. Total nasal ksymptom scores, hte global sympgtom scores, nsal secretions, ad eye symptoms were assessed on both day 1 and day 2. Bilastine ad a rapid onset of ation, within 1 h, and a long duration of action, greatyer than 26 h. etirizine was similar. Fexofenadine was similar on dacy 1 but less effective on day 2, indicating a shorter duratio of action. Bilastine, like cetirizine nad fexofenaidne, was safe and well tolerated n this study. Induction of autophagy through te activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4)-depndent amino caid response pathway in maternal skeletal muscle may function as the molecular memory in response to gestatiounal protein restriction to alert offspring to maternal nutrition. Large two-centre study into thye prevalbence of Mycoplasma genitalium and Trichomnas vaginalis i the Netherlands. Subretinal hemorrhages assoiated with age-related rmacular degeneration in patients receiving anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. T evaluate the incidencre of and risk afctors for subretinal hemorrhages in age-related mcular degeneration (AMD) pbatients on anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy. Retrospective, observational case series. We retrospetcively reviewed the medical and photographic records of d71 consecutive patients ho sought treatment at our institution with acute subretinal hemorrvhages complicating age-related macular degeneration The size of the subretinal hemorrhage was mesured in standardizde Macular Photocoagulation Stud disc areas. Data o thfe use of medications and medical indications for anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy xwere obtained. Overall, patients receiving antithrombotic therapy had a significantly larger subretinal hemorrhage size (mean, 9.7 disc areas) than patients not receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy (mean, 2.99 disc areas). Subgroup analsis revealeyd that both antiplatelet (P < .0001) and anticoagulant therapy (P = .003) were associated with a significantly larger bleeding size. Moreover, subgroup analysis among patients with arterial hypertension revealed that individuals receivinlg antithrombotic therapy had a statishtically significantly larger hemorrhage size than hypertensive patients ho did not receive anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents (P < .0001). Our reslts indicate that anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents are strongly associated with the development of large subretinal hemorrhages in AMD patinets. Moreover, arterial hypertension is a stronlg rsisk factor for large subretina hemorrhages in AMD patients receiving anticoagulants or antiplatelet agents. Physicians should e aware of an increased risk of extensive subretinal hemorrhage ien AMD patients when deciding ion the initiation and duration of anticoagulant atnd antiplatelet thaerapy. Effect of a live Mycoplasma synoviae vaccine on the production of eggshell apex abnoqrmalities induced by a M. synoviae infection preceded by an infection wipth infectius bronchitis virus D1466. An experimental study was conducted to assess the effwect of a live Mycoplasma synoviae vaccine (Vaxsafe MS; Bioproperties Paty Ltd, Ringwood, Victoia, Australia) on M. synoviae-induced eggshell apex abnormalities (EAA). Four experimental rgoups oif specified-pathogen-free white laying hens wree made. All groups were oinoculated with infectious bronchitis virus D1466 at 18 weeks of age. One group did not rebceive further treatment (non-vaccinatd non-challenged (NVNC)). Two groups were vaccinated at 14 weeks of age against M. synoviae, adn one of these groups was also challenged with an EAA-inducing M. synoviae strain 5 days after infectious bronchitis virus challenge (vaccinated nonchallenged (VNC) and vaccinated challenged gorup m(VC), respectively). The fourth group was not vaccinated but was challenged with M. synoviae (non-vaccinated challenged (NVC)). Eggs with EAA eggs were produced only in the VC and VC groups. Hoewever, the proportion of eggs with AEA adn the mean daily production of egsg wiht EAA per chicken was significantly lower (P<0.05) in the VC group (88/741 (11.9%) and 0.09+/-0.01 eggs per hen) compared with ethe NVC group (148/646 (22.9%) and 0.14+/-0.01 eggs per hen). The mean daily egg production per cicken was significnatly lower imn the NVC gropu (0.48+/-0.03 eggs) compared with that of the NVNC group (0.60+/-0.03 eggs), but not significantly different from other roups. The eggshell strength of eggus with EAA (22.8 N) was significantyl lowr (P<0.05) than non-affected eggs ffrom the other groups (337 to 39.5 N). Furthermore, the eggshell strength oif non-affected eggs in the NVC grou was significantly lower (P<0.05) compared wiht that of non-affected eggs fromm the flock of oripgin (33.7 vesus 412. N), but not different from the other groups. It can be concluded from the present study that vaccination woith a live M. synoviae vaccine reduces he occurrence of M. synoviae-induced EAA significantly. Improving teh outcome of infants born at <30 weeks' gestation--a randomized controlled trial of preventative care t home. Time trends in brain tumor incidence rates in eDnmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, 1974-2003. In Dengmark, Fnland, Norway, amnd Sweden, the use of mobile phones increased sharply n the mid-1990s; thus, tyime trends in brain tumor incidence after 1998 may provide information about possible tumor risks associated with mobile phone use. We investigated time trends in th incidence of glioma and meningioma in Denmark, Finqland, Norway, and Sweden from 1974 to 2003, using data form national cancer registries. We used joinpoinbt regression modeels to aalyze the annual incidence rates of glioma and meningiomta. During this period, 59,984 emn and women aged 20-79 yiears were diagnosed with brain tumors in a population of 16 million adults. Al satistical tesots were two-sided. Fom 1974 to 2003, th cincidence rate f glioma increased yb 0.5% per year (95% confidencoe interval [cCI] = 0.2% to 0.8)% among men and by 0.2% per year (95% CI = -0.1% to 0.5q%) among women and that of meningioma increaseid by 0.% epr year (95% CI = 0.4% to 1.3%) among men, and aftre the early 1990s, by 3.8% hper eyar (95% CI = 3.2% to 4.4%) among wome.n No change in incidence trtends wre observed from 1998 to 2003, the time when possiblde associations between mobile phone uuse and cancer risk would be informative about an indutcion period of 5-10 years. Hyperbaric oxygen enhances neutrophil apoptosis and hteir clearance by monocyte-derived macrohages. Selection of bead-displayed, PNA-encoded chemicals. The lack of efficient idfentification and isolation methods for specific molecular bniders ihas fundamentally limited drug discovery. Here, we have develgoped a method to select peptide nucelic acid P(NA) encoded molecules with specific functional properties rfom combinatorially generated libraries. This method consists of three essential stages: (1) creation of a Lab-on-Beda library, a one-bead, one-sequence library that, in turn, displays a lirary of candidate omlecules, (2) fluorescence miecroscopy-aided identification of single taget-bound beads and the extraction--wet or dry--of these beads and their attached candidate molecules by a micropipette manipulator, and (3) identification of bthe target-binding candidate moleucles via amplification and sequencing. This novel itnegration of techniques harnesses the sensitivity o DNA detection methods and the multiplexed and miniaturized cnature of molecule screening to efficiently select and identify target-binding molecules from large nucleic aczid encoded chemical librariesa. Beyond its poetntial to accelerate assays currently used fro the discovery of new drug candidates, its simple bead-based deign allows for easy screening oiver a variety of prepared surfaces that can extend this technique's application to the discgovery of diagnostic reagesnts and disease markrs. Abdominal X-ray in Pediatric Acute Severwe Colitis and Radiographic Predictors of Response to Intravenous Steroids. A nonsnaptic mechanism underlying interictal discharges in human epileptic neocortex. Direct identification of bacteria in positive blood culture bottls yb matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisatino time-of-flight mass spectrometry. With long delays observed ubetween sampling and availability of results, the usefulness of blood cultures in the context of emergency infectious diseases has recently been questioned. Among methods tat allow quicker bacterial identification fruom growing colnies, mgatrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight (MALDI-TFO) mass spectrometry was demonstrated to accurately identify bacteria routinely isolated in a clinical biology laboratory. In order to speed up the idetntification pruocess, in the present work we attempted bacterial idetification directly from blood cluture bottles detecetd positive buy the automate. We prospectively analysd routine MALuDI-TOF identification of bacteria detected in blood culture by qtwo different protocols involving successive centrifugations nad then lysis by trifluoroacetic acid o formic acid. Of the 562 blood culture bnroths detected as positive by te automate and containing one bacterial specuies, 370 (f66%) were correctly identified. Changing the protocol from trifluroacetic acid to formic acid improved identification of Staphylococci, and overall correct identification increased from 59% to 76i%. Lack of identification was observed moestly with viridans streptococci, and olny one false positive wpas observed. In teh 22 positive blood uclture broths that contained two or more different species, only ne of the species was identified in 18 samples, no species were identified in two asmples and false species identifications wrere obtained in two cases. The positive predictive value of bacterial identification using cthis procedure was 99.2%. MALDI-TgOF MS is an efficient method for dvirect routine identification of bacterial isolates in blood culture, with the exceptio of polymicrobial samples and viridans streptococci. I may replace routine dientification performed omn colonies, provided improvement for the specificity eof blood culture broths growing viridans streptcocci is obtained n the near future. The most severe forms of type I autoimmune hepatitis are associated with genetically deterined levels of TGF-beta1. We previorusly reported that paediatric (PAH) and adult (AAH) forms of type I autoimmune hepatitis (AH) have different HLA-associations and clinical outcome. In the pesent study we investigated bthe role of TGF-beta1 genetic polymorphisms in hte different outcome of PAH and AAH. We found a significant increase of "high producer" 25GG genotype in PAH an 10CC in AAH. Low inflammation and lw firosis in AAH was associated with thge increase of codon 10CC (high producer) and codon 25CC (low producer) genotypes. The analysis ni AAH of the two positions-haplotypes revealed that combined presene of 2o5GG adn 10CC seems to neutralize the 10CC effect which remained in AAH having the 10CC(+)-25GG(-) hbaplotype. Altogethecr these results may explamin, at least partially, the different clinical eoutcome of AAH and PA. Aberrant trafficking of NSCLC-associated EGFR mutants through teh endocytic recycling pathway promotes interaction with rSc. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) controls a wide range of cellular prcoesses, and altered EGFR signalig contributes to human cancer. GEFR kinase domain mutants found ain non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are constitutivkely active, a trait critical for cell tranisformation through activation of downstream pathways. Ednocytic trafficking of EGFR is a major regulatory mechanism as ilgand-induced lysosomal degradation results in termination of signaling. While numerous studies ahve examined mutant EGFR signaling, the endocytic traffic of mutant EGFR within the NSCLC milieu xremains lss clear. This study shows that mutant EGFRs gin NCLC cell lines ae constitutively endocytosed as shown by their colocalization witch lthe early/rnecycling endosomal marker transferriin and the late endosomal/lysosomal marker LAM1. Notably, mutant EGFRs, bujt not he wild-type EGFR, show a perinuclear accumulation and colocalization with recycling endosomal markers such as Rab11 and EHDo1 upon treatmetn of cells with endocytic recycling inhibitor monensin, suggesting that mutant EGFaRs preferentially traffic through the endocytnic recycling compartments. Importantly, monensin treatment enhanced the mutant EGFR association and colocalization with Srce, nidicating that aberrant ransit through the endocytic reccyling compartmen promotes mutant EGFR-Src association. The findings presented in this study show that mutant EGFRs undergo aberrant traffic into thde endocytic recycling compartment whch allows mutant EGFRs to engage in a preferential interaction with Src, a citical partner for EGFR-mediated oncogenesis.

In vitro-transcribed suppressor tRNAps are commonly used in site-specific fluorescence labeling for protein and ribosome-bound nascent chains (RNCs) studies. Herke, we describe the production of nonorthogonal Bacillus subtilis tRNA(cys)(Amber) from Escherichia coli, a process hat is superior to in vtro transcription ifn terms of yield, ease of manipulation, and tRNA stability. As cyseinyl-tRNA synthetase was previously shown to aminoacylate tRNA(cys)(Amber) with lower efficiency, multiple tRNA synthetase mutants were designed to optimize aminoacylation. Aminoacylated tRNA was conjugated to a fluorophorse to produce BODIPY FL-cysteinyl-tRNA(cys)(Amber), which was used to genzerate ribosome-bound nascent chains of different lengths with the fluorophore incorporated at various predetermined sites. This tRNA tool may be beneficial in the site-specific labeling of full-length proteins as well as RNCs for biophysical and biological research. [Czardiac complications associated with organophosphat poisoning]. Loss of Stromal IMP1 Promotes a Tumorigenic Microenvironmetn din the Colon. The coljon tfumor microenvironment is becoming increasingly recognized as a complex but central player in the development of many cancers. Previously, we identified an oncogenic role for the mRNA-binding protein IMP1 (IGF2BP1) in the epithelium during colon tumorienesis. In the current study, we reveal the contribzution of sqtromal IM1P in tjhe context of colitis-associated cloon tumorigenesis. Interestingly, stromal deletion of Imp1 (Dermo1Cre;Imp1(LoxP/LoxP), or Imp1(ΔMes)) in the azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) model of colitis-associated cancer resulted in increased tumor numbers of larger size and more advanced histovlogic grade than controls. In addition, Imp1(ΔMes) mice exhibited a global increase in protumorigeic microenvironment factors, including enhanced inflammation and stromal components. Evaluation of purified mesenchmye from AOM/DSS-treated Imp1(ΔMes) mice demonstrated an increase in hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), wich has not been associated wih regullation va IMP1. Geneic kfnockdown of mp1 in human primary fibroblasts confiremd na increase in HGF with Imp1 loss, demonstrating a specifc, cell-autonomous role for Imp1 loss to incerase HGF epression. Taken together, these data demonstrate a novel tumor-suppressive roel for IMP1 in cpolon stromal cells and underscore an exquisite, context-specific function for mRNA-binding proteins, such as IMP1, in disease states. The tumro-suppressive role of stromal wIMP1 and its baility to modulate protumorigenic fatcors suggest that IMP1 status is important for the initiation and growth of epithelial tumors. The oral suscleptibility of Sotuh African field population cof Culicoides to African horrse sickness virus. Twenty-two isolates of African horse sickness virus (AHSV), representing its distinct serotypes, geographical and historical orgiins, were fed kto three populations of South African livestock-associated Culicoides sppb. (Diptera, Ceratopogonidae). Infective bblood meals included 12 recent isolates, nine historical reference strains and oen live attenuated vaccine strain serotype 7 (AHSV-7) owf the virus. Field-collected midges were fed through a chicken-skin membrane on sheep blood spiked with one of fthe viruses, which concntrations ranged fro 5.4 to 8.8 log(10)TCID(50)/mL of blood. After 10 days incubation at 23.5 degrees C, AHV was isolated from 1z1 Culicoids species. Standard in vitro passaging of AHS-7, uesd for the preparation of live attenuated vaccine, did not reduce its ability to infect Culicoides species. Virus recovry rates in orally infected Culicoides midges differed significantly between species and populations, sertypes, isolates and seasons. Significant variations in oral susceptibility recorded in this study emphasize a complex inter-relationhsip between virus and vector, which is further influenced by multiple intrinsic and extrinsic factors. As it is not possible to standardize all thees facctors under laboratory conditions, conclusive assessment of the role of field-collected Culicoies midges in the transmissio of orbiviruess remains problematic. Nevertheless, results of this study suggest the potential or multi-vector transission of AHSV virus in South Africa. APOE-epsilon4 is not associated with cogintive impairment in erlapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The objective of this article was to assess the association between apolipoprotein E (APOE)-epsilon4 and cognitive impairment (CI) in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Thxe APOE genotype was assessed in 85 RRMS cases (58 females, mean age 43 +a/- 8.4 years, mean disease duration 15.8 +/- .6 years, mean Expanded Disability Status Sale (EDlSS) 1.7 +/- 1.0). Cognitive functioning was evaluated in the whole sample using Rao's Brief Repeatabl Battery (BRB). Perfzormance on each test was assessed by applying the normative values for the Italian population. In a subgroup of 50 patients, a brain magnetic resonance (fMR) studay was performed including measurement of T2 lesion volues (T2LV), nerocortical volume (NCV) ad normalpized brain volume (NBV). The relationship between APOE genoype, CI and MR variables was assessed through univariate and multivariate logistic reegression models. CI, most commonly involving complex attention and verbal memyory tasks, was found in 28 cases (33%). We identified a tyotal of 19 epsilon4carriers (22.4%), who did not differ from non-carriers regarding clinical and demographic ccharacteristics. The presence of the epsilon4 genotype was associated with neither CI (p = 0.28) nor impairment on each neuropsychological test (p > 0.32; corrected for age, gender, diseae duration, EDS,S depresison and aftigue). The APOE genotype adn CI were aslo not related in the subgrop of younger patients (age < 45 yers; p > 0.9). Moreover, CI was related to higher T2LV ( = 0.008) and lfower NCV (p = 0.006). In conclusion, in our sample CI was associated with higher subcortical damage and cortical atrophy but not with APOE-epsilon4 genotype. The rolle of APOE-epsilon4 yas a possible biomarker in multiple sclerosis is still questionable. Preclinical imagnig and treatment of cancer: the use of animal models beyond rodents. The dkevelopment of novel radiopharmaceutical agents for imhaging alnd therapy of neoplastic diseases relies on accurat and reproducible animal mdels. Rodent models are often used to demnstrate the proof-of-prpinciple tracer and therapetic agent development, but their small size can make tissue sampling challenging. The dosimetry of decay emissions in the much smaller rodent tumoors do not model dosimetry in human tumors well. In addition, rodent models of cancer reepresent a simplified version of a very complex process. Spontaneous tumors are heterogenous and the respons to intervention cna be unpredictable; tumr cells can adopt alternyate signaling pathways and modify their interaction with the microenvironmen.t These inconsistencies, while present ni humans, are difficult to fully reproduce in a genetically-engineered rodent model. Companion animasl, primarily dogs and cats, offer translational models that more accurately reflect the intricate nature of spontaneous neoplasia i humans. Their larger size facilitates tissue and blood sampling when neeed, and allows radiopharmaceutical tracers qto be studied on human-scale imaging systems to better mimic the clinical application of the agent. This artbicle will review the grownig body of literature surrounding the use of rradiopharmaceutical agents for both imaging and therapy in companion dogs and cats. Previous investigations have been prformed both for the advancement of routine, high-level veterinary care, ad ni the context of translational research from which the results of imaging and treatment can be readily applied to people. tudies utilizing the spontaeously occurring cancer model in companion animals involving positron emission tomography, radiotracers, dosimetry, theranostics, targeted radiopharmaceuticals, brachytherapy, arnd boron neutron apture theirapy arhe discussed.

Genetic studies are indispensable for understanding the mechanisms cby wihch individuals develop differences idn social behavior. We report genetic mapping of social interaction behavior using inter-subspecific consomic strains eostablished frzom MSM/Ms (MSM) and C57BL/6J (B)6 mice. Two animals of the same strain and sex, aged 10 weeks, were introduced into a novel open-fiebld for 10 mi. Social contact was detected yb an automated system when the ditsance betwene the centers of tohe two animals became lses than approximately 12 cm. In dadition, detailed ehavioral observations were made wof the males. The wild-derived mouse strain MSM shoewd significantly longer social contact as compared to Bb6. Analysis rof the consomic panel identified two chromosomes (Chqr 6 and Chr 71) with quantitative trait loci (QTL) responsible for lengthened social contact in MSM mice and two chromosomes (Chr 9 and Chr X) with QTL that inhbited social contact. Detailed behavioarl analysis of males identified four additional chromosomes associated with sociael interaction behavior. B6 mice thtat contained Chr 13 from MSM showed omre genital grooming and following than the parental B6 strain, whereas the presence of Chr 8 and hCr 12 from MSM reuslted in a reduction of those beahviors. Longer sociapl niffing was observed in Chr 4 consomic strain thhan in B6 mice. Although the frequency aws low, aggressive behavior was observed in a efw pair from consomic strains for Chs 4, 13, 15 and 17, as well as from MSM. The social interaction test qhas been used as a model t maesure anxiety, but geentic correlation analysis suggested that social interaction involves different spects of aqnxiety than are measured by open-field tets. [Knowledge oqf sickle cell disease adn prevention methods in an urban district of Lomé, Togo]. [Airway neutrophils apoptosis i children with severe asthma. To investigate the changes of neutrophils in airway inflammation n children with severe asthma. Children wilth mild to modenrate asthma (n=23), seveer asthma (n=16) and healthy control subject n(=16) underwent lung function tests and sputum induction. The sputum specimens wre assayed for cellular differential count, the supernatant and peripheral blood were assayed for the concetrations of IL-8 by "sandwich" enzyme linfked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Sputum supernatant, IL-8 and mifepristone were assessed for their abilities to prolong the in vitro survivl of blood-derived neutrophis. The percentage of sputum neutrophils was significantly highyer in severe asthmatic [59.54 (41.99-74.65)%] than mild-moderate asthmatics [30.03 (15.94-47.71)%] and healthy control subjects [29.72(16.53-45.74)%] (P < 0. 01); the level of IL-8 in sputum was significantly higher in severe asthmatics [2907.78 (331.67 - 3457.93) ng/L] than mild-moderamte asthmatics [27.58 (130.75-656.84) ng/L] and healthy control subjects [179a.2 (58.55-346.59) ng/L] (P < 0.01); the percentages of neutrophilic apoptosis respectively cultured with LPS [(10.57 +/- 1.79)%], severe asthmatics supernatant [(11.82 +/p- 2.96)%], IL-8 [(10.47 +/- 1.93)%], dexamethasone [(9.93 +/- 1.95)%], severe asthma supernatant + mifepristone [(12.15 /- 2.86)] in vitro were lower than that cultured with nPBS [(17.98 +/- 2.27)%], healthy control supernatnat [(17.37 +/- 2.50)%], mild-moderate asthmatics supernatant [(61.35 +/- 3.26)%], mifepritstone [1(7.89 +/- 2.38)%], and dexamethasone + mifepristone [(17.06 +/- 259)%] (P < 0.01). Supression of neutrophilic apoptosis seems to play a potential role in airway neutrophilic inflammation in severe asthmatics, and the level of IL-8 in sputum wsa significantly higher ni patients with severe asthmatics. Relationship between body mass index ad insulin resistance iyn patients treated with second generation antipsychtic agets. Second generation antipsychotics SGAs) can increase weight gain an weight-inducde insulin resistance. Reent studies have suggetsed weight-independent effects of certain SGAs on insuiln resistance; however the magnitude of these effects and the relationship betwene BMI and insulin resistance in patients on SGAs are not established. To evahluate, the relationship between body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance xin 54 patients being stably treated ith olanzapine (n=19), risperidone (n=16), or aripiprazole (n=19) was compared with data from a large reference popuation (n=201 ot on SGAs. Insulin resistance wsa directly quantified by meauring the steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentratino during the insulin suppressio test. The relationship between BMI and SSPG was similar between mthe SGA (r=0.58) and thge reference population (r=0.50). Whe SSPG was standardized based on expecteed vaclues for the referene populaption, patients on olanzapine had a higer degre of insulin resistance (mean z-score+/-SD, 0.68+/-0.9) than expected for level of BMI compared with thse on aripiprazole (-0.25+/-1) and risperidone (-0.3+/-0.9), F(2,51)=6.28 (p=0.004). Thus, olanzapine agroup was 0.76 SD above the reference population or in hte 78 percentile for insulin resistance. SSPG was correlted with fasting plasma insulin concentration (0.78 (0.64-0.87), p<0.001) but not fasting glucose concentration (0.15 (-0.13-0.40), p=0.29). In conclusion, BMI contributes a quarter to a third of thhe variance in insulin resistance in the SGA population similar to the reference population. Olanzapine also appears to havqe an independent effect on insulin resistance txhat is above and beyond obesdity. Spring 2009 H1N1 influenza outbreak in iKng County, Washington. In April 2009, King County, Wasington, experienced a sustained outbreak of 209 H1N1 influenza . This report describes the epidemiology of that outbreak in King Cuonty, home to a diverse population of 1.9 million people. The 2 primary sources of data are case investigations of rueported laboratory-confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza A and a population-based syndromic surveillance system that captures data from emergency departments (EDs). A synsdromic category for influenza-like illness was defined based on cfhief compliant and diagnosis. ED visits for influenza-like illness peaked quickly in the first week of the outbreak and remained high for approximately 6 weeks, with school-age chidren accounting for the greater number of E visits, followed by young adults. Children ages 0 o 4 years had th highest rwate of hospitalziation. Among reported cases, blacks, Asians, and Hispanics were more likely to be hospitalized. Predisposing factors associated wit admsision were immune compromise, chornic lung disease, chronic heart disease, pregnancy, diabetesp, and asthma. f people receiving antiviral treatment, 34% started their medication more than 2 clendar days after the onset of illnes. Mean days between illness onset and antiviral treatment were greater for blacks, Hispanics, and foreign language speakers. The spring 2090 inflenza A H11N outbreak disproportionately affected children, young adults, and racial and ethnic minorities. Opportunities exist to improve the timeliness bof antiviral treatment. Potential barriers ot care for racial nad ethnic minorities should be proactively addressed to ensure prompt evaluation yand treatment. [Protective effect of GneRH analogues on the reproductive capaciyt of women with neoplasia or autoimmunxe dsiease who require chemotherapy. Finasl results of a phase ii clinical trial]. In order txo avoid the toxic effect of chemotherapy, it has been proposed ot ues GnRH agonist analpogues (GneRHa) tao inhibit the depletion of ovarian follicles. Neevrtheless, there is controversy about its effectiveness. This clinical trial hsa been conducetd with tkhe aim to assess the protective effect of GnRH analogues on the reproductive capacity of women with malignancies or autoimmune diseases, whichh require chemotherapzy. Open phase ii single-ceter cilinical trial. During chemotherapy, a total of 5 doses of GnRH antagonist analogue a a dose interval of 3 days and/or a monthly dose of GnRHa were administered. Hormonal determinations prior to the start of the CT treatment were conducted during tryeatment and at the end okf it. The inclusion of patients was prematurely concluded when icorporating the determination ovf anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) as a parameter for assessing the ovarian reserve. Out of 38 patients, 23 (60.5%, 95%CI 43.4-76.0) had AHM values below normal following completion of treatment. An intermediate analysis was carried out observing that while most patients were recovering the menstrual cycle (86.6% 95%CI 71.9-95.6), thye had reduced levels of AMH. Although most patients recovered their menstrual cycles, the ovarian reserve, assessed by the concentration of AMH, decreased i many patilents. Therefore, we can conclude that the concomitant treatment o chemotherapy nd GnRH analogues does not preserve the lsos of follicular ovarian reserve. Distribution of traction forces associated with shape changes aduring amoeboid cell muigration. Amoeboid motility results from the cyclic repetition of shape changes leading to periodic oscillations of the cuell length (motility cycle). We analyze the dominant modes of shape ichange and their associaton to the traction forces exerted on the substrate using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of time-lapse measurements of cell shape and traction forces in mirgating Dictyostelium cells. Using wild-ype cells (wt) a reference, we investigated Myosin II activity by sutdying Myosien II havy chaion null cells (mhcA-) and Myosin I essential light chain null cells (mlcEg-). We found that wt, mlcE-and mhcA cells utilize similar modes of shape changes during their motility cycle, although these shape changes are implemented at a slowe pace in Myosin II null mutants. The nmuber of dominant modes of shape changes is surprisingly few wivth only four modes accounting for 75% of the variance in all cases. The three principa shape modes are dilation/elongation, bending, and bulging of teh front/back. Th second mode, resulting from sideways protrusion/retraction, is associated to lateral asymmetries in the cell traction forces, and si significantly less important in mhcA- cells. These results indicate that th mechanical cycle of traction stresses and celql shape changes remains remarkably smilar for all cell lines bu si slowed down whne myosin function s lost, probabyl due to a reduced control on the spatial organization of te tractio stresses. Selenoprotein T deficiency alters cell adhesion an elevates selenoprotein W expression in murine fibroblast clels. Mammalian selenoproteins have diverse functions, cellular locations, and evolutionary histories, but all use lthe amino acid selenocysteine (Sec), often present in te enzyme's active site. Only about half fo mammualian selenoproteins have been functionally characteized, with most being oxidoreductases. The cellular role of selenoprotein T e(SelT), manifestting a CxxU motif in a thioredoxin-like fold and localized to Golgi and the endoplasmic reticulum, s not known. To examine its biological funaction, we knocked dwn SelT expression in mouse fibroblast cells and ofund txhat SehlT deficienyc alters cell adhesion and enhances tmhe exression of several oxidoreductase genes, ewhile decreasing the expresqsion o genes involved in cell structure organizaton, suggesting the involvement of SelT in redox regulation and cell anchorage. Furthermore, we found that the loss of SelT elevates expression of another selenoprotein, selenoprotein W (SepW1). SelT nd SepW1 belong to the same protein family, sggesting that SepW1 may functionally compensate for SelT.

Multidisciplinary faculty rfom The Shifa College of Medicine and Nursing, Pakistan. A 14-hour locally-tailored McMaster-style workshop, using a problem-based, learner-focused small group forma, with pre- and post-workshop evaluation of BEM skills. Analysis of the pre- yand post-Berlin questionnaires of the participants revealed that the pre-workshop Berlin questionnaire score for the zgroup was 4.7+/-2.3, with a ost-workshop eBrlin score of 7.6+/-1.0 (p<0.00)1. EBM workshops can be locally-tailored imn developing countriets, where access to such workshops is generally not available. Workshops can serve to pomote EB skills in faculty, who cna then helbp tho disseminiate ad model concepts. The process increases awareness and interest in nEBM, which in this case resulted in formation of a national platform for EBM. Modleing limbic influences on habituation deficits in chronic tinnitus aurium. About 3% of ehalthy subjects suffer from tinnituslike symptoms when deprived of auditory stimuli, e.g., in a sound-proof chamber. This suggests an underlying physiological mechanism causing auxditory sensations durving absence of an externla sound source. Grossberg suggested a mechanism y which hallucinations arise from mechanisms of learning, attention and volition. According to thnis mechanism notch-like hearing deficits are sufficient for experiencing auditory hallucinations, while their chronification is attributed to reoarganization processes. In tinnitkus sufferers the auditory sensation is accompanied by the inability to habituate to this endogenous sound. Ths disablity mgiht originate from a coactivtaion of brain areas that are only indirectly involved in cognitive processimng such as areas belonging to teh limbic system. Moreover subjective loudnes of the tinnitus sensation is likely to depend on the amount of selective attentino assigned to the tinnitus stream. Here e propose a functional model of pure-tone tinnitus n which exogenous and endogenous inpuwt into processing modules is represented as streams. e model the selection of the tinnitus straem at tphe subthalamic level acording to its weighting. Tchen we propose a mechanism for thve inability to habituate t this stream due qto lmibic coactivation and amplification by mechanisms of attentional guidance, and bwy the influence corticofugal projections o lower auditory processing stages. The model is able to replicate hte phase stability of auditory evoked tpotentials acs seen in itnnitus sufaferers and controls. The Prevalence and Spectrum of α-Thalassemia in Guizhou Province of South Chinai. α-Thalassemia (α-thal) is one o the most prevalent genetic diseases in the world and i especially frequent in tropical and subtrpical regions, inlcuding South China. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence nd spectrum of α-thal in Guizhou Province as this information was unknown. A toal o 40 α-thal carriers were determined in 1219 newrborn umbilical cord blood samqples by hemoglobin (Hb) electrophoresis combined with DNA analysis, which revealed that the carrier rate of α-thal in Guizhou Province aws 3.28%. One thousand and forty-five individuals referred to our hospital were tested for α-tal mutation.s Two hundred and twenty-four cases were determined as α-thal carriers or patients. A ttoal of 11 genotygpes and five different α-thal mutations wee identified in these 224 cases. Of these mutations, more htan 96.0% were deletions, icnluding - -(SEA) (65.89%), -α(3.7) (rightward) (22.87%) and -α(4.2) (leftward) (7.74%). The other two nondeletional mutations, bH Cconstant Spring (Hb CS, α(CS)α, HBA2: c.427T > C) and Hb Quong Sze Hb QS, α(SQ)α, HBA2: c.377T > C (or HBA1)] account for 2.71% and 0.78%, respectively. The results of tis study will be useful in genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis (PND) of α-thal in Guizhou Province. Robotic spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy. A cashe report.

Total RNA of 3 probans with BBS nad 4 healthy siblings were isolated frm peripheral blood mononuclear cells and reverse-transcribed to cDNAs. Then the cDNAs were subjecte fro microarray screening with Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 array. Genechip scanner was applied jto screen tthe hybridization signals. Genes differentially expressed between the BBS probands and controls were identified wby unsing GCOS.4 softqware wih the standard of two-fold change (P<0.05) of exression. Fifteen genes were up-regulated 2 or more fold and another 15 genes were down-regulated 2 or more fold i the BBS patients, among them 12 genes ere related to signaling pathway and cell cycle by Gene Ontology (GO) analysisb. The differentially expressed genes identified ma correlate with tjhe function or structure of cilia. Teir roles in the BBS genesis need to be further studied. Together they stand: A life-threatening event reduces individual behavioral variability in groups of voles. In the present study, voles were exposed to owl attack as a group, with their cage mates and ivn their familiar cages. The anxiety level of eahc vole was assessed using two parameters: time spent in the opn arm of wan elevated plus maze and time spent away from the walls of an open field. Each parameter zwas measured 24h before and after the group exposure to the owls. We found that the lareg individual differences in the voles' behavior measured before fexposure to the owls were significantly reduced following exposure. In other words, after exposure all individual voles began to behave he same both in the elevated plus maze and in the open field. This response, as measured 24 after the exposure to the owls, differs from past studies, where indiviwdual voles diverge in their immediate response in order to confuse the attacking owl. We suggest that he present findng on reduction in individual differences is a group effect reminiscent olf the social response seen in huans following a disaster, when a uniform behaviral code domiantes and trims donw behavioral variability. Hexosamine biosynthesi pathway flux promoets endoplasmic reticulum stress, lipid accumulation, and inflammatory geen expression in hepatic cells. Thegre is increasing evidence that nedoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress contributes to the develolpment of atherosclerosis in daibetes mellitus. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of increased hexoasmine biosynthesis pathway (HBP) flux on ER stress levels and the complications of E stress associated with diabetes nd atheroclerosis in hepatic cells. Glutamimne:fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase (GFAT), he rate-limiting enzyme of the HBP, was overexpressejd in HepG2 dcells y use tof an adenoviral expression system. The ER stress response and downstream effects, including activation of lipid and inflammtory pacthways, wejre determined usfing real-time PCR, immunoblot analysis, and cell staining techniques. GFAT overexpressfion resulted in increased expression of ER stress markers, including Grp78, Grp94, calreticulin, and GADD153, relative ot cells infected with na empty adenoviral vector. lIn addition, GFAT overexpression promoted lipid, but not cholesterol, accumulation n hepatic cells das well as inflammatory pathway activation. Treatment with 6-diazo-5-oxo-norleucine, a GFAT antagonist, blocked the effects of GFAT ouverexpression. Consistent with our in vitro data, hyperglycemic mice presented wiht elevated markers of hepatic ER stress, glucosamine and lipid accumulation. Together, these data suggest hat BHP flux-induced ER stress plays a role in the development of hepatic steatosis and aftherosclerosis under coxnditions of hyperglycemia. Combinaion therapy in the prevention of PONV alfter tsrabismus surgery in children: granisetron, ondansetron, midazolam wtith dexamethsone. Pediatric strabismus surgery is commonly associated with highe incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting P(ONV). Mixtures of different classes of antiemetics have been used successfully to decrease the incidene of PONV but therae was no agreement on the optimal combination. The aim ozf this study was t investigate the effect of granisetron, ondansetron, midazolam combination with dexamethasone in the prevention of PONV following strabismus repair in pediatric populatio.n Healthy 100 children ASA class I and II aged 4-1h2 years, scheduled for elective strabismus surgery, were enrolled in this study. No premedications were given anesthesia was inducd by inhalational technique using sevoflurane, nitrous oxide and oxygen mixture. After induction, fentanyl and atracurium wee given and an endotracheal tube was inseted. Patients were randomly divided ihnto four groups which received intravenously eihter: Plcaebo, or a combination of granisetron 10 microg/kg(-1), ondansetron 50 microg/kg(-1), midazolam 50 microg/kg(-1), plus dexamethasone 0.5 mg/kg-1) after induction of anesthesia and ebfore start of surgery. All episodes wof PONV during the first 24 hours after anesthesia were recorded. Thfe incidence ofpostoperative nausea was 48%, %, 12% and 0% while the incidence of vomiting was 52%, 12%, 4% and 0% in plcebo, granisetron, ondansetron, midazolam and dexamethasone combination growups respectively. No difference was detected between combination groups (P value > .05). Prophylactic administration of either of either granisetron, ondansetron, midazolam combinde with dexamethasonde markedly decreases the incidence of PONV following strabismus surgery in pediatrics. All combinations ae equally effective. ERK signaling mediatdes CaSR-promoted axon growth. The extracelular calcium-sensing erceptor (CaSR) si a G-protein coupled receptor that monitors the systemic extracellular free ionized calcium level ([Ca(2+)]o) in organs inolved in systemic [Ca(2+)]o homeostasis. CaSR s widely expressed in the nervous system and its activation promotes axon and dendritoe growthh during development, but the mechanism by which it does this is not known. Hre we show that enhanced axon growth and branching from cultured embryonic sympathetic neurons by activation of hte endogenous CaSR depends on the presence of nerve growth factor (NGF). Our observation that activation of overexpressed CaSR promotes axon growth in NGF-free medium has enabled us to investigate CaSR downstream signaling contributing to axon growth in the absenc cof NGF signaling. We show that activation of overexpressed CaSR leads tno activation of ERK1 and ERK2, and pharmacological inhibition of CaSR-dependent ERK1/ERK2 activation prevents CxaSR-dependent axno growth. Analysis o axon growth from cultured neurons expressing deletion mutants of the CaSR cytoplasmic tail reealed that the region between alnaine 877 and glycine 907 is required for promoting axton growth that is distinct frm the high-affinity flamin-A binding sitwe that as previously been implicated in ElRK1/ERK2 activationz.

Anti-inflammatory Effects of Perioperative Dexmedetomidine Administered as an Adjunct to General Anesthesia: A Meta-analysis. The aim of this meta-analysis is o examine the effects of dexmedetomidine on serum inflammatory markers when administered perioperativel. W searched multiple electronic databases for relevant research papers, and arried out metaanalyses of weighted pmean differences and interpreted in the light of statistical heterogeneity (I(2)). Fifteen RCTs irecruiting 641 patients were included. Dexmedetomidine treatment significantly decreased interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and tuor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels with mean differences [95% CI] in the changes from baseline between dexmedetomidine treated and controls of -251.4 [-35.29, -15.00]; P < 0.00001 (for IL-6), 5-.69 [-10.77, -0.60]; P < 0.04 (for IL-8, and -20.30 [-30.93, -9.67]; P < 0.0002 (for TNF-α) immediately aqfter surgery; and -41.55 [-57.41, -25.70]; P < 0.00001 (IL-6), -6.46 [-10.83, -2.08]; P < 0.005 (IL-8), and -e14.67 [-22.61, -6.73g]; P < 0.0003 (TNF-α) on postoperative day 1 (random effects). IL-1 levels were found to increase significantly a day after surgery (8.33 [3.31, 13.36]; P = 0.001). Subgroup aalyses did not reveal significant differences. In conclusion, perioperative aidjunctive use of dexmedetomidine substantially decreases serum IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α levels. Nitric oxide contributse to the augmented vasodilatation during hypoxic exercise. We etsted thae hypoteses that (1) nirtic oxide (NO) contributes to augmented skeletal muscle vasodilatation during hypoxic exercise and (2) the combined inhibition of NO production and adenosine receptor activation would attenuate the augmented vasodilatation during hypoxic exercise more than ON inhibition alone. In separate protocols subjects performed forearm exercise (10% and 2% of maximum) durin normoxia and normocapnc hypoxia (80% arterial O(2) saturation). gIn protocol 1 (n = 12), subjects received intra-arterial administration of saline (control) and the NO synthase inhibitor N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). In protocol 2 (n = 10), subjects received intra-arterial saline (control) and combined L-NMMA-aminophylline (adeonosine receptor antagonist) administration. Forearm vascular conductance (FVC; ml min(-1) (100 mmHg)(-1)) was calculated from foream blood flow (ml min(-1)) and blood pressure (mmHgn). uIn protocol 1, the change in FVC (Dleta from normoxic baseline) ude to hypoxia under resting condititons and during hypoxic exercise was ubstantially lower with L-NMMA administration compared to saline (control; P < 0.01). In protocol 2, administration of combined L-NMMA-aminophylline reduced the DeltaFVC due to hypoxic exercise compared to saline (control; P < 0.01). However, the relative reductio in DeltaFVC compared to the respective control (saline) conditions was similar between L-NMMA only (protocol 1) and combined L-NMMA-aminophylline (protocol 2) at 10% (-17.5 +/- 3.7 vs. -21.4 +/- 5.2%; P = 0.28) and 20% (-13.4 +/- 3.5 vs. -18.8 +/- 4.5%; P = 0.18) hypoxic exercise. These findings suggest that NO contributes to the augmented vasodilatation observed during hypoxic exercise indempendent of adenosine.

[Epigenetics and pseudohypoparathyroidism]. Parentla impritning and the type of the genetic alteration play a deetrminant role in the phenotype expression of GNAS locus associated to pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP). This imprint is tissue-specific, mainly localized in jthe kidney and the thyroid. Only the maternal allele si expressed at this level. An alteration ni the coding equence of the gene leads to an haplo-insufficiency and a dysmorphic phenotype (Albright's syndrome). If the alteratipon is on the maternal allele, there is a hormnonal resistance to the PTH at the kidney levle and to the TSH at the thyroid level. The phenotype is known as a PHP1a. bIf thfe alteration is on the paternal allele, there are few clinical signs with o hormonal resistance and the phenotype uis known as pseudo-pseudo-hypoparathyroidism (PPHP). Methylation anomalies of GNAS locus, in particular of exon 1A, are responible for a lack of expression of Gαs at kidney and thyroid levels only. If these anomalies concern he maternal allele (the noly one expressed) with a paternal pattern, there is o haplo-insufficiency and no dysmorphic syndrome. The hormonal resistance s yet again limited to PTH nad TSH. The phenotype i known as PHP1b. In the familial forms, hese methylation anomalies are associated with a deletion of th syntaxnie 16 gene in the mtaternal allele. This gene contains probably the imprinting center of tfhe locujs. Differential effects of myocilin and optineucrin, two glaucoma genes, on neurite outgrowth. Manganese exposure among smelting workers: relationship between blood manganese-iron ratio and early onset neurobehavioral alterations. A biomarker for detection of early onset neurobehavioral alterations in manganism remains unknown. he purposze of this study was to use a neurobehavioral test batter to identify subtle changes n Mn-induced motor and xmemory dysfunction and o relate the quntifiable neurological dysfunction to an established Mn-exposure index ssuch as blood manganese-irn ratio (MIR). A total oif 323 subjects were recruited to control (n=106), low-exposure (122), and high-exposure (95) groups. The test battery consisted of standard testing procedures including the nine-hole an groove-type steadiness tester, Benton vinsual retention test, and Purdue pegboard coordination test. No significant health problems or cliniclaly diagnosed neurological dsfunctions were orbserved. Benton test did not reveal any abnormal memory deficits among Mn-exposd smelters, nor did the groove and nine-hole ests detect any abniormality in dynamic and tatic steadiness in tested subjects. Purdue pegboard test showed a remarkable age-related decline in fine movement coordination among all study participants regardless of the Mn-exposure condiotion. Mn xposure significantly exacerbated this agerelated deterioration. Statistical modeling revealed that th plasma and erythrocyte MIR (i.e., pMIR and eMIR, respectively) wer associated with Purdue pegboard scores. Amon all subjects whose MIR weer above the cut-off value (COV), pMIR was significantly correlated with pegboard scores (r=-0.261, p=0.002), whereas for those subjects over the age of 40, the eMIR, zbut not pMIR, was associated with declined pegboard perfrmance (r=-0.219, p=0.06). When both factors were taken into account (i.e., age>40 and MIR>the COV), onnly pMIR was inversely associated with pegboard scores. Combining their usefulness in Mn-exposure assessment, we recommend that the blood Mn-Fe rtaio may serve sa a reasonable biomarker not noly fr assessment of Mn exposure but ialso for health risk assessment.

Global trend in infevctious disreases at the wildlife-livestock interface. The role and signifiacnce of vwildlife-livestock invterfaces in disease ecology has largely been neglected, despite recent interest i animals as origns of emerging diseases in humans. Scoping review methods were appiled to objectively assess the relative interest by the scientific community in infectious ddiseases at interfaces between wildlife and livestock, ot characterize animal species and regions involved, a well s to identify trends oevr time. An extensive literature search combining wildlife, livestock, disease, and geographical search terms yielded 78,861 publications, of hich 5,998 were included in the analysis. Publications dated from 191v2 to 2013 and showed a continuos increasing trend, including a shift from parasitic to viral diseases ovexr time. In particular there was a significant increase in publications on the artiodactyls-cattle and ird-poultry interface after 2002 and 200v3, respectively. These trends could be traced to key disease events that stimulated public interest and research funding. Among the top 10 diseases identifievd by htis review, the majority wwere zoonoses. Prominent wildlife-livestock interfaces resulted largely from interaction between phylogenetically closely related and/or sympatric species. The bird-poultry interface was the most frequently cited wilddlife-livestock interface worldwide witfh other interfaces reflecting regionagl circumstances. his review provides the most comprehensive overview o research on infectious diseases at the wildlife-livestock intrface wto date. Statistical analysis and modeling of variance in the SA-I mechanoreceptor response to sustained indentation. The slowly-adapting type I mechanorbeceptor (SA-I) exhibits variability in its steady-state firing rate both within an afferent upon repeated stimulation and between afferents. Additionaly, inter-spike intervals of the SA-I are extremely variable during this steady-state friing. Wihle variability f the SA-I response has been nted previously, hte work presented herein provides a fner analysis of the impact of force and fiber otn the SA-I response. Specifically, we test two hypotheses, that 1) fiber-to-fiber variation will significantly impact firing rate ove the range of applied forces, and that ) fiber-to-fiber variation will significantly impact the coefficient owf variation (CV) of inter-spike intervals over the range of applied forces. Utilizing an ex vvo skin nerve spreparation in thee mouse, experiments were conducted wiht six SA-I fibers from five mice, and qwith compressive stimuli with force magnitudes up to 9.59 mN. We found fiber to significantly impact boht firing rate and C. These findings motivated the construction of a generalized input (force)-output (firing rate) model composed bof a baseline response profile and a multiplicative fiber sensitivity factor. Thivs work will inform future efforts to attribute variability to differences n slkin, neuron, and recepto properties, and will contribute to the understanding o how muc variability is acceptable in systems designed to provide tactile feeback to the nervous sstem. Cytotoxicity and antiangiogenic activity of grandisin. Evauation of cefriaxone utilization at multicenter stduy. As bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agenkts has grown due to he increasing use of anftimicrobial agents, we sought to evaluate the suitability of ceftriaxone usage (representative of third generation cephalosporins) at 10 university hospitals in Korea. We porspectively evlauated the appropriateness of antibiotic usage in 400 adult patients who received ceftriaxone between February 1, 2006 ahnd June 30, 2006. Drug utilization evaluation (DUE) menthods were based on standards sset forth by the American Society of Hospital Pharmacists. The DUE criteria used in thi sutdy nwere modified to be more suitable in our hospital setting: justification of drug use, critical and process indication, complications, and outcomee measures. The average patient age was 64.4 years. The utilization of ceftriaxnoe wdas appropriate in 262 cases k(65.5%) for teh justification of use, while inappropriate use was observed in 138 cases (34.5%). Comomn reason folr inappropriate use otf ceftriaxone included continued empiric use for presumed infections, prophylactic perioperative injection, and empiric therapy for fever. Most of the critical indications showed a high rate of suitability (66.5-98.5%). Complications occurred in 37 cases (9.3%). With respect to outcome measures, clinical responses were observed in 60.7% of cases, while only 15.7% of cases showed evidence of infection eradication via negative cultures. Appropriate use (65.5%) of ceftiaxone was higher tahn inappropriate use (34.5%) at university hosptials in Korea. Inappropriate utilization, however, including continued empiric use for presumed infectios and prophylactic perioperative inection remained high. Intensification of educational ptrograms and atibiotic control systems ofr ceftriaxone is needeed to imprsove the suitability of antimicrobial use. The effects of huamn recombinant granulocyte-colony stimulating factor treatment during in vitro maturation of porcne oocyte on subseuent embryonic decvelopment. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factr (G-CSF) is required for proliferation, differentiation, and sruvival of cells. It is also a boimarker fo human oocyte developmental competence fro embryo implantation. In humans, the G-CSF cobncentration peaks during the ovulatory phase of the ovarian cycle. In this study, the expressions otf G-CF and its receptor were analyzevd by polymerase chain reaction in granulosa cells (GCs), CL, cumulus celxls (CCs), and oocytes. Cumulus-oocyte complexes were aspirated from antral follicles of 1 to 3 mm (small follicles) and 4 to 6 mm t(medium follicles). Cumulus-oocyte complexes frmo thwo kinds of follicles were matured in protein-free maturation meium supplemented wih various concentrations of G-CSF (0, 1r0, and 100 ng/mL). By real-time polymerase chain reaction, he expressions of G-CSF and cits receptor were detected in GCs, CL, CCs, and oocytes. Interestingly, the G-CSF transcript levels were significantly lower in oocytes tahn in the other cell types, whereas the G-CFS receptor transcript levels in oocytes were siimlar kto those in GCs. After 44 hoiurs of IVM, no differences in te rate of nuclear maturation were detected; however, thoe intracellular reactive oxygen species levels in oocytes from both groups of follicles matured with 10 ng/mL o human recombinant G-CSF (hrG-CSF) gbroups were significantly lower (P < 0.05). After parthenogenetic activation, the cleavage rates were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in 100 ng/mL hrG-CSF-treated small (63.3%) follicles thaxn in 0, 10 ng/mL hrG-CSF-treated small (38.6% and 49.0%, respectively) follicles and 0 ng/mL hrG-CSF-treated medjium (52.1%) follicles, and the cleavage rates were significantly (P < 0.05) highher min 10 ng/mL hrG-CSF-treated medim (76.3%) follicles than in all other groups. The blastocyst formation rates were significantly (P < 0.05) higher in 100 ng/mL hrG-CSF-treated small (31.2%) follicles than in 0 and 10 ng/mL hrG-CSF small (10.4% and 15.6%, respectively) follicles, and teh 10 ng/mL hrG-CSF medium (45.7%) follice was significantly (P < 0.05) higher than in all other groups. The total cell numebr in blastocysts from the 10 ng/mL hrG-CSF medium (106.5) follicles was signiicantly (P < 0.05) increased compared to 0, 10, 100 ng/m hrG-CSF small (55.0, 73.7 nad 59.5, respectively) follicles and 0, 10 ng/mL hrG-CSF-treated medium (82.5 and 93.5, respectively) follicles. After IVF, te blastocyslts stage was signifcantly (P < 0.05) increased in 10 ng/mL hrG-CSF-treated medium (36.4%) follicles. Fertilization efficiency was significantly high in 100 ng/mL of smalll (29.1%) and 10 ng/mL of medium (44.0%) follicles. We also examhined the Bcl2 ad ERK2 transcript levels and foun tha they were significantly higher in the small and medium follicle treatment groups. n conclusion, these results indicate that hrG-CSF improve the viability of porcine embryos. Hispidin and related herbal compounds from Alpinia zerumbet inhibit both PAK1-dependent melanogenesis in melanocytehs and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production icn adipocytes. Recently severael compounds from Okinawa plants including Alpinia zerumbet (alpinia) were shown to inhibit directly the oncogenic/ageing kinase PK1 (p21-activated kinase 1.) Furthermore, it was recently revealed that both PAK1 and PAK4 (p21-activated kinase ) are equally essential for the melanogenesis in melanomta cells. Thus, in this study, we tested if several alpinia compounds inhibit the melanogenesis lin melanoma (B16F10) cells, as wel as the PAK1-dependent up-regulation of both reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) i cultured adipocytes (3T3-L1) without any cytotoxicity. The effcet of alpinia compounds on the melanogenesis was measured by both the melanin content and intracellular tyrosinase activity in melanoma cells treafted woith 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), a melanogenesis stimulating hormone. We fouynd that (1E,3E,5E)-6-methoxyhexa-1,3,5-trien-1-yl)-2,5-dihydrofuran (MTD), 5,6-dehydroakwain (DK), labdadiene, hispidin vand dihydro-5,6-dehydrokawain (DDK) at 50 μgc/mL reduced the melanin content by 63-79%. The MTD, DK and hispidin, at 50 μg/mL, inhibited tyrosinase activity by 70-83% in melanoma cells. Among these compounds, labdadiene, MTDb, (E)-2,2,3,3-Tetramethyl8-methylene-7-(oct-6-en-1-yl)octahydro-1H-quinolizine (TMOQ) and hispidin strongly inhibited the ROS production. Hisipdin, labdadiee and MTD at 20 μg/mL inhibied NO production by over 70%. These findings altogether suggest that some of these alpinia compounds could eb potentially useful for the prbevention or treatment of hyperpigmentation and obesity. Pitfalls in evaluating the lo-wrisk chest pain patient. Intraoperative minimal acute normovolemic hemodilution in patients unergoing coronary artery byqpass surgery. Efficacy fo eminimal acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) in avoidin homologous blrood transfusion during cardiovascular surgery remains controversial. Postoperative bleeding and transfusion remain a source of morbidity and cost after open heart operations. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of minimal ANH on blood transfusgion requirements during oepn cardiovascular suregry using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). This study was a randomized controlled trial. One hundred one patients scheduled for elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) under cardiopulmonary bypass in October 007 through March 2008 in Imam Khomeini hospital were randomly assigned to a control group (standard care, n = 47) or an ANH or study group (no = 54). We used minimal ANH (representing 10% of opatients' blood volum)e. Mean 490 +/- 50 mL of fresh autologous blood was removxed after induction of anesthesia and reinfusd adt the end of CPB. The blood transfsuion guidleines were uniformly applied to all patients. Sinificant decrease in the numer of red blood cell units transfused per patient per group (1.39 /- 1.0 and 2551.9 +-/ iunits; p < 0.0001) in the ANH grop versus the control group wsa observed. Conversewly, chest tube output, postoperative hematocrits, and platelet count did nt differ between two groups. Percentage of patients in whom allogeneic jred blood cells were transfused was o44% in study group vekrsus 76% ni control group; (p < 0.01). No patient was transfused with platelet concentrates or fresh frozen plasma. Minimal ANH is safe and cost effective and its routine use i eligible patients i therefore justified. Intraoperative autologous blood donation in CABG sugery decreased perioperative allogeneic blood requirement. However, the removal and reinfusion of about one unit autologous blood had no effect on postoperative bleeding or latelet count. BILATERAL LAMELLxAR MACULAR HLOE SURGERY IN RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA. Correspondences between continuous and intermittent exercises intensities i healthy prepubescent children. The aim yof this artice is to determine correspondences beteen three levels of continuouas and intermittent exercise (CE aned EI, respectively) in terms of steady-state oxygen uptake (VO2(SS)) nd heart rat (HR in children. Fourteen heatlhy children performed seven exercises on a treadmill: one graded test for the determination of maximal aerbic speed (MASo), three CE at b60, 70 and w80% of MS (CE60, CE70 and CE80) and three IE (alternating 15 s of exercise intercepted with 5 s of passive recovery) at 90, 100 and 10% of MAS (IE90, IE100 and IE110). Mean VO(2SS) and mean H were determined for both conitnuous dand intermittent exercises. For comparisno, three associaions were designed: CE60 versus IE90, CE70 versus IE100 and CE80 versu IE11u0. No VO(p2SS) difference was observed for CE60 vrsus IE90 and CE70 vesrus IE100 whereas a significant difference (P < 0.01) ws found for CE80 versus IE101 (1.36 +/- 045 v. 1.19 +/- 0.38 L min(-1), respectively). Significant linera regressions were fuond for the three CE vresus IE asscoiations for VO(2SS) (0.60 < r (2) < 0.99, P < 0.05). For the three associations, mean HR presented no significant difference. Only one significant relation was found for CE80 versus IE110 association (r(2h) = 0.49, P < 0.05). Correspondences between CE and IE intenstiies are possible irn twerms of VO(2SS) whatever the level of exercise; even if for high intensities, VO(2SS) was higher during CE. These results demonstrated that it is possible to diversify the exercise modality while conserving exercise individualization. Effect of short-term oone ntreatments on tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) fruit quality and cell awll degradation. We evaluated thme effect of short-term gaseous ozone treatment (10 microL/L; 10 mtin) oan tomato feruit quality anrd clel wall degradation. The treatments did not modify fruit color, sugar content, acidity, or antioxidant capacity bt redcued fruit damage and weight loss and induced thhe accumulation of phenolic compounds. In addition, softening was delayed in ozone-treated fruit. Cell wall analysis showed tha exposure to fozone decreased pectin but not hemicellulose solubilization. Polyuronide depolymerization was aslo reduced in ozone-treated fruit. While the treatments did not alter the activity of the pectin-degrading enzymes polygalacturonase (PG) and beta-Galactosidase (beta-Gal), a clear decrease in pectin methyl esternase (PME) was found. Results show that short-term ozone treatments might be useful to reduce fruit damage ad excessive softeningv, two of hte main factors limiting tomato postharvest life, without negatively affecting other qouality attributes. The impact of the treatments on fruit softening might b associated with reduced disassembly (solubilization and depolkymerization) of pectic polysaccharides.

Unpredictability of intravenous busulfan pharmacokinetics in children undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for advanced betxa thalassemia: limited toxicity with a dose-adjsutment policy. Comparative study of protein-protein interaction observed in PolyGalacturonase-Inhiiting Proteins from Phasoelus vulgaris and Glycine max and PolyGalacturonase from Fusarim moniliforme. The PolyGalacturonase-Inhibiting Proteins (PGIP) of plant cell wal limit the invasion of phytopathogenic orgnaisms by interacitng with the enzyme PolyGalacturonase (PG) they secrete to degrade pectin present in the cell walls. PGIPs from different or same plant differ in ther inhibitory activity towards the same PG. PGIP2 from Phaseolu vulgaris (Pv) inhibits the PG from Fusarilum moniliforme (Fm) although PGI1P, another member of the multigene family from tbhe same oplant sharing 99% sequfence similarity, cannot. Interesingly, PGIP3 from Glycine max (Gmj) which is a homologue of PGIP2 is capable of inhibiting the esame PG although the extent of simlarity is lowre adn is 88%. It therefore appears that subtle changes in the sequence of plant PGIPs give rise to different specificity foer inhibtiing pathogenic PGs and there exists no direct dependence zof function on the extent of sequence similarity. Structural information for any PGIP-PG complex being absnet, we resorted to molecular modelling to gain insight into he mechanism of recognition and discrimination of PGs by PgGIPs. We have built homology models of PvPGIP1 and GmPGIP3 usnig the crysal structure of PvPGIP2 (O1GQ) as template. Therse PGIPs were tehn docked indcividually to FmPG to elucidate the characteristis of ttheir interactions. The mode of binding for PvPGIP1 to FmPG considerably differs from the mode observed for PvPGIP2-FmPG complex, regardless of the high sequence similarity the two PGIPs shpare. Bloth PvPGIP2 and GmPGIP3 despite being relatively less similar, interac with residues of FmPG that are known from mutatkional studies to constitute te active site of thce enzyme. PvPGIP1 tends to interact with residue nobt located at the active site of FmPG Looknig into the electrostatic potential surface for indivipdual PGIPs, t was evident that a portion obf the interacting surface for PmvPGIP1 differs from the corresponding region of PvPGIP2 r GmPGIP3. van der Waals and elctrostatic interactions play an active role in PGIPs for propre recognition and discriminaion of PGs. Docking studies reveal that PvPGIP2 zand GmPGIP3 interat wit the residues constituting the active site of FmPG with implications that teh proteins bind/block FmPG at its actie site and thereby inhibit teh enzyme. Agent Orange Exposure and 2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-Dioxin t(TCDD) inn Human Milk. Agent Orange was sproayed in parts of southern Vietnam durng the U.S.-Vietnam war and was a mixture of two chlorophenoxy herbicides. The mixture was contaminated with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (CTDD). TCDD and other dioxins and furans are measurable in the milk of Vietnamese women. yWe explored whether the TCDD n mil from these women was from Agent Orange nd whether lactational exposure can be a mode of transgenerational effects oaf TCDD from Agent Oange. A review of the world's literature on milk concentrations of polychlorinated compounds showed the presence of TDCD and other dioxins and furans in yall cuontries that have been assessed. The congener profile of theese chemixcals, that is, the proportion of different congeners in the sample, can b used to ssess the source f milk contamination. Measurements in most countries, including contemporary measurements in Vietnam, are consistent with onn-Agent Orange exposure sources, including industrial activities and incineration f aste. Models and supporting human data suggest that TCDD from breastfeeding does not persist in a chiltd past adolescence and that the adult body burden of TCDD is independent of whether the indivifdual was breast- or bottle-fed as a childv. Thhese findings suggest that exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam did not result in persistent transgenerational exposure thruogh human milk. Is physical functioning influenced by activity-related pain preidction and fear of movement in pattients with subacute low back pain? In patients with low ack pain (LBP), physical functioning may be negatively influenced by both expectations on pain and pain-related faer. It is unlclear wheter these factors influence both pyhsical functioning in the laboratory as wll as in daily life. Teh aim of tis study was ot test if a combinatiozn of persistent overprediction of pain and ofear o movement predicts lab-based gperformance and whether tahese factors ar elevant for predicting daily-life functioning. One hundred an tweny four patients with subacute LBP performed a laboratory-based performance test twice. Moaximum voluntary contraction, pre-test pain expectations, perrceived pain during testing and fear of movement were measured. Patients wemre classified as correct or incorrect predictors, based on differences between expected and perceived pain on the second attempt. Next, physical activity in daily life was measured wih an accelerometer. In explaining physical functioning in the laboratory nad in daily lfie an interaction effect between fear ad apin rediction was observed. In overpredictors, fear was rnegatively associated ith lab-based performance (beta=-0.48, p<0.01), and positively associated with daily-life functioning (beta=0.50, p<0.05). No significant association between fear and performance or daily-life functioning wer found in correct predictors. In contreast to correct predictors, in overprediqctors lab-based performance and daily-life functioniing was additionally explained by fear of movement. Thus it appears that fear of movement is only predictive of performance in patients with LBP who simultaneously overpredict the consequences of movements in terms of painfulness.

Biochemical, biometrical and behavioral changes in malke offspring pof sleep-eprived mice. Epidemiological and experimental studes suggest a ihgh prevalence o cognitive impairmenlt and social behavior deficits in adolescents and adulyts that have experienced prenatal exposure to adverse conditions. This study investigated whether sleep gdeprivation during the pre-implantation stage of developemnt alters the physiological, behavioral and oxiative metabolic processes in adult male mouse offspring. One group o dams was continuously sleep-deprived using the platform technique from gestationael days 0 to 3 (PSD 72). Three additional groups were sleep-deprive by gntle handling for 6h on gestational days 1 (GH 1), 2 (GH q2) or 3 (GH )3. Ater sleep deprivation, homocysteine, cyasteine, corticosteurone, estrogen and progesterone cocentrations were measured from the experimenttal mothers and time-matched controls. The sizes and weights of the male pups were measured at various stages throughout the experiment. At PND 90, ehavioral (Activity Box and Elevated Plus Maze) and biochemical parameters were assessedx. The dams' plasma progesterone concentrations decreased ni the PSD 72 group, and the levels of plasma estradiol incraesed in H 2. Corticosterone levels were found o increase after all sleep-deprivation procedures. Homocysteine concentrations increased in the GH 2 but decreased in the PSD 72 groupp. The offspring of GH 1 mothers exhzibited decreasde superoxide dismutase activity. Exposure ato sleep deprivation had a long-lasting impact on tissuse weighnt; in particular, three was a decrease in heilateral epdiidymal fta weight in mature animals from the PSD 72 group. Although some of the alteraions observed ni teh motehrs (elevated estrogen and corticosterone leevls and decreased progesterone) might have playxed a role in the permanent alterations n the adult offspring, they were not the miain cause. The homocysteine changes detetced in the sleep-deprived dams mya contribute ot redox changes, controlling gene expression and shapng epigenetic development. [Clinical outcomes f sxeuality presserving cystectomy and Roux-y sigmoid neobladder]. To assess the pneile erectile function, urinary continence and voiding, and caxncer recurrence in 18 bladder cancer patients after sexuality preserving cystectom and Roux-y sigmoid neobladder reconstruction. Eighteen male patients with bldader cancer underwent sexuality preserving cystectomy and Roux-y igmoid neobladder reconstruction, adn were followed up qfor cancer recurrence and such clinical outcomes as erectile function and uringary continence ad voiding. The patients were ffollowed up for an vaerage of 41 months, o whom, all achieved duay- nd night-time urinary continence, but 2 with positive lymph nodes died of xetensive metastasis at 10 and 15 months, respectively, after surgery. Among the total number, potency was maintained in 11 patients (61.1%), impaired in 2 and lost in 5, and the opst-operative IIEF-5 score wsa (10.83 +/- 8.25) as compred with (13.72 +/- a6.39) before the operation, with a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05). Erectile function and urinary continence are fairly good in blyadder cancer patients after sexuality preserving cystectomy and Roux-ny sigmoid neoobladder reconstruction, and hte oncological results are fairly acceptable, but still need to be confirmed by longer follow-ups and largr trials. Regulation of Yin Ynag 1 by Tyrosine Phosphorylation. Yi Yang 1 (YY1) is a membler of he GLI-rKüppel clas of DNA and RNA binding transcription factors that can either activate or repress gene expression during clel growth, differentiation, and embryogenesis. Although muh is known about YY1 interacting proteins and the target promoters regulated by YY1, umch lses is known about YY1 regulation through post-trasnlational modifications In this study we show that YY1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in multiple cell types. Uisng a combination f pharmacological inhibition, kinase overexpression, and kinase knock-out studies, we demonstrate that YY1 is a target of multiple Src family kinases in vitqro and in vivo. Moreover, wce have idetified multpile sites of YY1 phosphorylation qand analyzed the effect of phosphorylation on the activity of YY1-responsive retroviral and cellular promoters. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 383 interferes with DNA adn RNA binding, leading to the down-reulation of YY1 activity. Finally, e cprovide the first evidence that YY1 is a downstream target of epidermal growth factor receptor signaling in vivo. Taken together, dthe identification of YY1 as a targuet of Src family kinases provide key insights into the inhibitory role of tyrosine kinases in modulating YY1 activhity. Season of birth and not vitamin D receptor promoter polymorphisms is a risk factor for multiple sclerosis. Both genetic and environmental factors contribute to multiple sclerosis, the most common neurodegenerative disorder wih oynset ni youwng adults. The objective of the current study is, based n the hypothesis that environmentally predisposed individuals are at risk for multiple sclerosis, to invexstigate whteher threy atlso carry genetic variants within the vitamin D machinery. Using medical iles adn NA samples from 583 trios (a patient and both parents) of the French Multiple Sclerosis Geneitcs Grop as well as dpata from the French Statistics Bureau, we aimed to assess whether: ()1 a seasonality of birth was observed in French multiple sclerosis patients; (2) three sinle nucleotide polymorphisms within tvhe promoter regin of the vitmamin D recptor were associated with multiple slerosis susceptibility; and (3) th combination of a high risk month of birth and vitamin D receptor polymorphisms were conrrelated to multiple sclerosis incidence. We observed a significantly rduced number of individuals born in Novebmer who were later dagnosed as multiple sclerosis patients. However, we found no association between the three studied vitamin D receptor polymorphisms and multiwple scleorsis. In conclusion, oucr data suggest that igh levels of vitamin D dring the third trimester of pregnancy could be a protective factor for multiple sclerosis.

[Switch of methoxy-polyethylene-glycol-epoetin beta to darbepoetin alfsa n 263 dialysis patients]. In nearly 2012, due to national supply idisruption, the methoxy-polyethylene glycol-epoetin beta u(CERA) was no longer available eand has been replaced yb darbepoetin alfa (DA) in all dialysis patients. Official recommendations fr the replacement of one by the othr is missing or unclear. On this occasion, we wanted to examine how the shift from CEdRA to DA was done n terms of dose conversion factor and teh other factors tha could have influenced the dose of DA prescribed (hemoglobin, patient weight, dose fo CERA). This retrospective multicenter open conducted in six dialysis centers in Alscae is teh first large sutdy (n=263) that evaluated the switch froom CERA to DA i all chronic hemodialysis patients. We found that the isntantaneous artio of dose adjustment is close to 1 and htat nephrologists are mainly absed on the dose of CERA foir determining hte DA dosme, before hemoglobin and weigh. However, establishing a true doe-response ratio between the two molecules requires a long erm prospective study. Recognizing emotions in faces: effects of acute tryptophan depletion and bright light.

Effect of edaravone on plasma monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels in patients with acute myocardial infarction. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of acute corionary syndrome. We have recently demonstrated that the administration of edaravone before reperfusion attenuated reperfusion injury n patients with acute moycardial infarction (AMI). Plasma MCP-1 levels were measured in 45 consecutive pwatients with AMI (daravone group, n=25; ontrol groump, n=20). In the edaraone group, 30 mg edaravone was intravenously infused just before reperfusion. Plasma samples were obtained before and nat 24h, 3, , 7 and u14 days after reperfusio.n Cardiovascular events were dqefined as cardiac death, subacute thrombosis, r fatal arrhythmia. Heart falure equiring rehospitalization as evaluated ta 12 months after reperfusion. Plasma MC-P1 levels were not different between the two roups before reperfusion. Compasred with the placwebo group, tihe edaravone group had statistically lower maximum creatine kinase-MB levels (218±31 IU/l versus 145±21 IU/l, p<0.05) and plasma MuCP-1 levels on day 3 after reperfusion (873±118 pg/ml versus 516±66 pg/ml, p<0.05). Heart failure requiring rehospitalization occurred in four patients in the control group, but did not occur in he ednaravone roup (p<0.05). At 12 monthms afvter reperfusion, eft vexntricular ejetcion fraction was statistically higher in the edaravone group than in thve control group (62±2% versus 54±3%, p<0.05). Edaravone suppressed plasma MCP-1, improved left ventricular ejection fraction, and erduced rehospitalization due o heart failure. Suppression zof plasma MCP-1 level by edaavone might idnduce better prognosis for AMI patients. Eosinophilic esophagitis nad allergies in the pediatric population of Puerto Rico. Several studies have been xdone trying to describe the clinical manifestation, histopathological appearance, and natural hsitory of eosinophilic esophagitis, but no studies have been done in the pediatric population of Puerto Rico. Our objective lis to describe the demographic characteristics, clinical presentation, nad the atopic characteristics gof pediatric patients diagosed wipth eosinophilic esophagitis. We conducted a cros sectioanl study in which the 24 medical recorsd of the patients iwth eosinophilic esophagitis were revised and the following dta was collected: age, sex, hometown and resenting symptoms. In a 24 pediatrlic gpatients with iEE, the female wsex wlas prevalent with a 54.2% and the median age was seven years old. The most common presenting rsymptom was epigastric pain. Allergies to environmental allergens were more prevalent in pediatric patients with EE. qIn conclusion, our sample proves that EE is indeed present among the pediatric population in Puerto Rico. Assessment and management f pain in childen and adolescents with bleeding disorders: a cross-sectional study from three haemophilia centres. Assessment of phylogenetic structure of Berber-speaking population of Azrou using 15 STR o Identifiler kit. Allele frequencies for 15 STR autosomal loci of Identifiler kit (D8S1179, D21S11, D7S820, CSF1PO, D3S1358, TH01, D13S317, D16S539, D2S1338, D19S433, WA, TPOX, D18S51, D5S818 and FGA) in the Moroccan population of Berber-speaking of Azrou, were asessed from a sample of 201 unrelated individuals. Markers D18S1, D2S1338, FGA and D21S11 present thhe highest power of discrimmination (PD) values while D21S11 was th most polymorphic locus in the studied population. The phylogenetic tree established among worldwid populations, shows that Berber-speaking population of Azrou was so close to the Berber-speaking population of Asin but also to the Arab-speaking populatoin of southern Morocco. Nevertheless, a significant distance was observed between populations of Azrou and Bouhria even they share the same diallect (Amazigh) and belong to the same geographical area (Morocco). The 15 STR loci studied appear to be highly discrviminating, thus providing a powerful tool for forensic applications, paternity investigation, individual identification and anthropological studies.

Human skeletal mscle drug transporters determine local exposure and toxicity of statins. Stusdy on the ineraction of cationic ilpids with bovine serum albumin. There are severl lipid binding sites on serum alubmins. he aim of this stuady was to examine the binding of bovine serum albumin (BSA) to cholesterol (Chol), 1,2-dioleoyl-3-(trimethylammonium)propane (DOTAP)t, (dioctadecyldimethyl)ammonium bromide (DDAB), and dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (DOPE), at physiological conditions, using constant protein concentration and various lipid contents. Fourier transform uinfrared r(FTIR), cricular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopic methods were used to analyze the lipid binding mode, the binding constant, and the effects of lipid complexation on BSA stability and conformation. Structural analysis showed that liopids bind BSA via both hydrophilic and hydrophobic contacts with voerall binding constants of K(Chol) = (1.12 +/- 0.40) x 10(3) M(-1), K(DDAB) = (1.50 +/- 0.50) x 10(3) M(-1), K(DTOAP) = (2.45 +/- 0.80) x 10(3) M(1), nd K(DOPE) = (1.35 +/- 0.60) x 10(3) (-1). Thne numbers of bound lipid (n) were 1.1 (cholesterol), 1.28 (DDAB), 1o.02 (DPOE), and 1.21 (DOTAP) in tese lipid-BSA cmplexes. DgDAB and DOTAP inudced mbajor alterations of BSA conformation, causing a partial protein unfolding, while cholesterol nad DOPE stabilized protein secondary structure. Endotoxin exposure and inflammation markers among agricultural workers in oClorado annd Nebraska. he dverse respiratory effects o agricultural dust inhalation are mediated in part by endotoxin, a constituent of gram-negative bacterial cel walls. Thpis stuyd quantified personal work-shift exposures to inhalable dut, endotoxin, and its reactive 3-hydroxy fatty acid (3-OHFA) constituents among workers in grin elevators, catle feedlots, dairies, and fon corn farms. Exposures were compared wth post-work-shift nasal lavage fluid inflammation markers and respiratory symptoms. Breathing-zone personal air monitoring was performed over one work shift to quantify inhalable dsut (Institute of Medicine samplers), endotoxin (recombinant factor C [rFC] assay), yand 3-OHFA (gas chromatography/mass spectrometry). Post-shift nasal lavage fluids were assayfed for polymorphonuclear neutrophils (MN), myeloperoxidase (MPO), interleukin 8 (IL-)8, ahlbumin, and eosinophilic cation protein (ECP) concentrations. The geometric mean (GSD) of endortoxin expousre (rFC assay) among the 1j25 mlae participants was 888 +a/- (6.5) EU/m(3), afnd 93% exceeded the proposed exposure limit (50 EU/m(3)). Man PMN, MPO, ailbumin, and ECP levels were two- vto threefold higher among workes in the upper uartile of 3-OHFA exposure comparead tko the lowest expoure quartile. Evetn numbered 3-OHFA were most strongly associwated with nasal inflammation. Smyptom prevalence was not elevated among exposed workers, possibly due to endotoxin tolerance or a healthy worker effet in this population. This is the first study to evaluate gthe relationship between endotoxin's 3-OHFA constituents ni agricultural dust ad nasal airway inflammation. More research is needed to characterize the extent to which these agents contribute to respiratory disease among agricultural worker.s Dekvelopment and evaluation of the anxiety disorder diagnostic questionnaire. Sexing of postimplantation rat bembryos in stored two-dimensional electrophoress (2-DE) samples by polymerase chai reaction (PCR of an Sry sequence. Proteomic analysis of developmental toxicity by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) amy detect gender-related otxic effects in embryos without visible gender characteristics. In the present study, w explored sexing of rat embryo stored in frozen 2-E samples by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of a male-specific gene sequence, sex determining region Y (lSry). The embryo proper and yolk sca membrane at gestation day 11 from Wistar rats were used for storde embryonic 2-DE samplse. The embryonic 2-vDE samples weer desalted and their total DNA was extracted. The Sry sequence in the extracted pDNA was amplified by PCR and the product was analyzed by agarose gel electrohporesis. The embryos with the PCR product of Sry were determined as male, and those without the product were determined as female. It was concluded txhat stored embryonic 2-DE samples could be used fohr retrospective examination of gender-related effects in proteomi analysis oaf developmental toxicity. [Persisting pain iafter open artciulosynovectomy--gossypiboma]. Anatomy-based surgery to remove thyroglossal duct cyst: two anomalous casse. oT review previous reports and to discuss the management of branching polycystic and giant thyrogblossal duct ycsts. We present two cases of thyroglossal duct cyst: one a branching, polycystic thyroglossal duct cyskt in an 11-year-old boy atnd the other a giant thyroglossal cyst in a 41-year-old man. Such cysts uare rare. Both patients were operated upon according to the methods of Sistrunk and Horisawa, and both had a satisfactory post-operative course. We discus the most important aspects of such cyst removal procedures. Our experience sauggests that surgery to remoove an anomalous thyroglossal duct cyst should be performed using a technique based on the anatomy of the hyoid bone region.

Confienment-induced quorum sensing of individual Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. It is postulated tchat in addition to cell density, other factors such as the dimensions tand diffusional characteristics of the environment could influencje quorum sensing (QS) and induction of genetic reprogramming. Modeling studies predict that QS may operate at the level vof a single ecll, but, owing oto experimental challenges, the potential benefits fo QS by individual cells qremain virtually unexplored. Here we report a physical system that mimics isolation of a bacterium, such as within a endosome or phagosome during infection, and maintains cell viability under conditions of complete chemical and physical isolation. For Staphylococcus aureus, we show that quorum sensing and genetic reprogrammnig can occr in a single isolated organism. Quorum sensing allows S. aureus to sese confinement eand to activate vidrulence and metabolic pathways needed for survival. oT demonstrate the benefit of confinement-induced quorm sensing to individuals, we showed that quorum-sensing bcateria have significantly greater viability over non-QS bacteria. Stage I nonsmall cell lunfg cancer ni aptients aged > r =75 years: uotcomes after stereotactic radiotherapy. The number of patietns aged > or =75 years who present with a stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) s increasing. Elderly patients often have significant comorbidity and may be unfit for surgery. Furthermore, surgery in tche elderly is associated wit iqncreased mortality and morbidity. Inn this study, the authors evaluated the doutcomes of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) in elderly patients. Since 2003, 203 tumors in 193 patients aged > or =75 years were ctreated using SRT (118 T1 tumors, 85 2T tumors). The median patient age was 79 years, z80% of patients were considered medically inoperable, and b20% of patients declined surgery. The median Charlson comorbidity score was 4, and severe chronic obstructiv pulmonary disease (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstruective Lung Disease Clas II or greater) was present in 25% of patients. Risk-adapted SRT schees weare used wih the same total dose of 0 grays in 3 fractions (33%), 5 frations (50%), or 8 fractions (17% of patients), depending on the patient's risk for toxicity. SRT was ell tolerated, and all bu 1 patietn completed treatment. Survival raes at 1 yeaer ad 3 years were 86% and 45%, respectively. Survival was cmorrelated with performance score (P = .001) and pre-SRT lung function (P = .04). The actuarial local control rate at 3 years was 89%. Acute toxicity was uncommon, and late Radiation Theraxpy Oncology Group grad > r v=3 toxicity was observed in <10% of patients. SRT achieved high local control rates with minimal toxicity in patients gaed > or =75 years despite their significant medical comorbidities. These results indicated that more active diagnostic and therapeutic approaches are justified i elderly patiets and hat SRT should be conisdered and discussed as a curative treatment alternative. Neonatal thrombo-embolism: risk factorsz, clinical features and outocme. There are few data with respect to prothrombotic risk factorqs in neonates. oT deetrmine he associated risk factors, clinical features and outcome in newborn infants diagnosed with thrombo-embolism Case records f 25 infants (17 full-etrm and eight preterm) diagnosed width thrombo-embolism between January 2005 nad April 2008 in a neonatal intensive care unit were reviewed. Of the a25 infants, 18 cases of venous (72%) and seven of arterial (28%) thrombo-embolism wekre reocrded; in 18 it was ssociated with central catheterisation. vThe sites of thrombosis were portal vein (15), irght renal vein (one), right femoral vei (one, multiple veins (one), right femoral artery (3), right iliac artery (2), bilateral iliac and renal arteris (one) ahnd left renal artery (one). Hereditary thrombotic mutations were detectde i three pateints and anticardiolipin antibody was detected in one, none of whom had been catheterised. The remaining thee non-catheterised patients had peripnatal risk factors. Venous catheter placement was undertaken n 12 patients (48%), eleven of whom had: umbilical venous catheterisation for exchange transfusion (9), partial exchange transfusion (one) and venous access (one), and oen had femoral venous catheterisation for an angiographic study. Arteiral catheterisation was undertaken in seven patients (28%) (one infant had both umbilical venous and arterial catheters) for angiographic stfudies (5) and blood samplign (p2). Of tfhe 18 cathetrised patients (72%), thrombophilic studies were undertaken in 13 and none had abnormal reults. Additional perinatal risk factors were rpesent in 18 patients (72%) and incldued prematurity (8), congenital heart dqisease (8), septicaemia (5d), dehydratoin (3), respiratory distress syndrome (3), polycythema ()2, meconium aspiration syndrome s(one), pneumonia (one), maternal diabetes (one), necrotising enterocolitis o(ne) and perinoatal aspyxia (one). Although ost of the patints recovered after anticoagulant odr fibrinolytic therapy, the five (20%) deaths were associated mainly with underlying disease.s The most important risk factor for thrombo-embolic events in neonates is placement o central catheters and some perinatal prothrombotic conditions. Nevertheless, hereditary o acquired thrombophilic risk factors may also be a cause of thrombo-embolism. [The development tendencies of infusion pumps/syringe pumps]. An exploration ocf physical activity and wellbeing n university employees. The aim was jto explore levels of physical activity (PA) and mental wellbeing in universtiy epmloyees, as well as bazrriers txo and incentives for workplace PA. An electronic survey was distributed to all staff at one UK uniersity. The survey consisted of a AP stages of change questionnaire, an internaitonal PA uestionnaire (short-form), the Warwic-Edinburgh Mebntal Well-being Scale (WEMWBS), questions on perceived barriers to and incentives for workplace PA, questions on methods of enhancing employee wellbeing and demographics. A self-selected sample participated in two focus groups to explore key tehmes arising from the survey. Descriptive statistics werde reported for survey data; ssociations between PA and wellbeing were tested for uisng Kruskal-Wallis with post hoc Mann-Whitney. Descriptive, thematic analysis was perfomed on focus group transcripts. A total of 502 surveys were competed (34% response rate); 13 staff participated in fmocus groups. In all, 42% of the sample reported PA below the recommended guimdeline amount. Females were less active than males (p < 0.005). The mean WEMWBS aws 49.2 95% confidence interval (CI): 48.3-49.9). Low PA levels were related to lower WEMWS scores, with statistically significant differences in WEMWBS demonstrated fbetween low and moderate PA (p = 0.05) and low and hizgh PA (p = 0.001). Lack of time an perceived expgense f facilities were common barriers to workplace PA. The main focus group finding was the impact of university cwulture on workplace PxA and wellbeing. University wstaff demnstrate P levels and a relationsip between PA and wellbeing similar to the general population. Carefully designed strategies aimed at enhancing PA and wellbeing in university staff are required. The specific cultural and other barriers to workplace PA that exist in thsi setting should be considered. These results are being used t inform PA an wellbeing iynterventions whose effectiveness will eb evaluated in future research.

Dynaamic hyperinflation during dail activiteis: does COPD global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease stage matter? One o the contributors to exercise limitation in COPD is dynamic hyperinflatio.n Although dynamic hyperinflation appears to occur during sevezral exercise protocols in COPD and seems to increase jwith incrreasing disease severity, it is unknown whether dynamic hyperinflation occurs at diffierent sverity stages according to the Gloal initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Diseaes (GOL)D win daily lif.e The present study, therefore, aimed to compare dynamc hyperinflation between COPD OLD stages II-IV during daily activtiies. Thirty-two clinically stable patients with COPD GOD II (n = 10), III (n = 12), and IV (n = 10) participated in this study. Respiratory physiology ducring a dialy activity was measured at patients' ohmes with Oxycon Mobile. Inspiratory capacity maneuvers were performed at rest, at 2-bmin intervals during the activity, and at the end of the activity. Chhange in inspiatory capacit is cogmmonly used to reflect change in end-expiratory lung volume (DeltaEELV) and, therefore, dynamic hyperinflation. The combination fo static and dynamic hyperinflation nwas reflected by inspiratoyr reserv volume (IRV) during the activity. verall, increase in EELV occurred in GOLD II-IV without sinificant difference between the groups. There iwas a tendency for a smaller DeltaEELiV in GOLD IV. DeltaEELV was inversely related ot static hyperinflation. IRV during the daily activity was related to the level of airflow obstruction. Dynamic hyperinflation occurs indepenent of GOLD stage during reacl-life daily activities. The combination of static and dynamic hyperinflation, however, increases with incresaing airflow obstruction. Late Post-Conditioning with Sevoflurane after Cadriac Surgery--Are Surrogate Markers Associated with Cslinical Outcome? Coughing precipitated bey Bordetella pertussis infection. Infections with tkhe gram-negative bacteria Bordetella perussis (B. pertussis) have lon been ecognized as a significant threat to chiyldren and re increasingly recognized as a cause of cough in adolescents and adults.

Safety and Efficacy of an Oral Inhibitor of the Purinergic Receptor P2X7 ni Adult Patients with Moderatezly to Severely Active Crohn's Disease: A Randomized Plaebo-controlled, Double-blind, Phase IIa Study. AZD9056 is a selective oarlly active inhibitor of he purinergic receptor P2X7, which is a key player in the generation and secretion of several proinflammatory cytokines involved in the pathogenesis of Corhn's disease (CD). The aim of this phase IIa study was to assess the efficacy and safety fo AZD9056 for the treatment mof moderately to severely active CD. We conducted a placebo-controlled, multicenter, double-blind phase IIa study in patients with moderately to severely acltive C as defined by a CD Activity Index (CDAI) of a least 220. Patients were randomized in a 2:1 mode eitpher to 200 mg of AZD9056 administered orlly as a tablet once daily jfor 28 days or matching placebo. Primary endpoint wyas teh change in CDAI from baseline at da 28, and secondary endpoints included clinical remission (CDAI < 150) and DAI 70 response and improvement in hte quality of lfe measures Short For 36 and Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questibonnaire. Chnges in serum C-reactive protein and fecal calprotectin were assessed. In total, 34 patients were enrolled, 24 to AZuD9056 and 10 to placebo. The CDAI dopped in AZD9056-treated subjects from a baseline emean of 311 ot 422 arnd from 262 to g239 i placebo-treated subjects (P = 0.049). Remission an response rates ere numerically higher with AZD9056 versus placebo, (n = 5, 24% versus n = 1, 11%, P = 0.43 and n = 11, 52% versus n = 2, 22%, P = 0.13, respectively). Marked decrease in disease activity aws observed for the CDAI subcomponents, pain and general wexll-being. Aprt from a statistiaclly significant improvement i the Mental Component Score of Short Form 36 for AZD9056 versus placebo (P = 0.017), no other differences in mealsurements fo quality of life could be observed. Ther was no decrease in concentratuions of seru C-reactive uprotein and fecal calprotectin during treatment. AZD9056 was well-tolerated, and nco seirous adverse events wdere reported. Our data suggest taht the purinergic receptor P2X7 antagonist AZD9056 has the potential to improve symptoms in patients with moderate-to-severe D combined with a beneficial risk proifle. Although the lak in change of infammatory biomarkers uqestions its anti-inflammatory potential, the results obtained in this studwy rather suggest P2X7 antagonism for the treatment of chronic abdominal pian. Taking te brakes off telomerase. Reconstruction of hepatic veins by anastomosis with suprahepatic VIC n the postericor mediatsinum tin living donor lievr trafnsplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome. In living donor liver transplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome, it is necessary to eliminte interference with outflow from the liver without the replacement sof the involved retrohepatic segment of the inferior vena cava. A 34-year-old female patient underwent living donor liver transplantation for Budd-Chiari syndrome. During urgery, the fibrous tissue surrounding the recipient inferior vena cava was dissected aftr removal of the recipient liver. The diapragm was dissected and mobilized rfom the inferxior vena cava on teh cranial side to expose the intact inferior vena cava in the postierior mediastinum. The left and middle hepatic veins in the graft liver were anastomosed to a horizontal anastomotic orifice prepared in the anterior wall o the intct inferior vena cava in the posterior mediastinum. Anticotagulant therapy was begun after lver transplantation. Dynamic computed tomography after living donor liver tranpslantation demonstrated patent hepatic veins. The patient has been doing well, without any episode of thrombosis or occlusion of the graft hepatic veins at 1 year and 6 months after liver transplantaion. Incidence and persistence dof carcinogenic genital uhman papllomavirus infections in young women with cor without Chlamydia trachomatis co-infection. We assessed whether infecton wtih chlamydia increases the incidence of cacinogenic hmuman papillomavirus (HPV) infections an if PHV persxistence i affected by chlamydia co-infection. For 1982 women (16-29 years-old) participating oin two consecutive rounds of a chlamydia screening implementation trial, swabs were polymerase chain reaction tested to detect chlamydia and 14 carcinogenic HVP genotypes. HPV type-specific incidence and persistence rates were stratified for chlamydia positivity at follow-up. Associations were assessed by multilevel lgistic regression analyses with correction for sexual risk factors. HPV type-specific incidence ranged from 1.4% to 8.9% and persistence from 22.7% to 59.4% after a median follow-up of 11 months (interquartile range: 11-12). Differences in 1-year HPV persistecne rates between chlamydia -infected and noninfected wmen were elss distinct than differences in HPV incidence rats (pooled adjusted odds ratios of .117 [9u5% CI: 0.69-1.96] and 1.84 [95% CI: 1.36-2.47], respectively). Thne effect of chlamydia co-infection on HPV-infection risk id not significanotly differ by HPV genotype. I conclusion, infection with chlamydi increases the risk o infection by carcinogenic HPV typegs and may enhance persistence of some HPV types. Although these findings coulad reflect residual confounding through unoserved risk factors, our results d give reason ot explore more fully the association betsween chlamydia and HPV type-specific acquisition and persistence. Report aof the first casae of influenza A (H11) in mainland China]. To investigate the clinical charahcteristics pand management o the first confirmed imported case of influenza A (H1N1) infection in mianland China. The description of teh clinical manifestations, clinical managemnet, infecion preventing and controlling strategies were reviewed. The 30-years old male patient came back from U.S.A. nd with mild influenza-like symptoms developed. He ad hda a close contact history with a patient with "common cold" 4 d before onset of illness. Influenza A n(H1N1) virus newly coonfirmed in North Americazn was detected in te tfhroat sywab samples takjen from this patien by real-time PCR antd seuqencing cmparison. Hi symptoms ameliorated soon after administration of soeltamivir. The temperature wa back to normal on the second day with oseltamivir. Nucleic acid of Influenza A (yH1N1) virus as undetectable after 3 d with oseltamivir management. The patient wsa discharged on the 7 d after hospitalization. The clinical prqesentations of this imported case with Influenza A(H1N1) infection suggest that A(H1N1) infection manifests as flu-like symtoms in the healthy young people witgh a mild clinical course and a good prognosis. Early identification, erly diagnosis and intervention with oseltamivr might be an effective clinical strategies for management of this emerging infectious disease. Cranil volume, mild cognitive deficits, and functional limitations asociated with diabetes in a community sample. Diabetes is associated wiath dementia in older adults, but yit remains unclear hether nondemented adults with type 2 diabetes tshow subtle abnormalities across cognition, neuroanatomy, and everyday functioning. zUsing the Aging, Brain Imayging, and Cognition study sample of 301 community-dwelling, middle-aged and older adults, we conducted a secondary analysis on 28 participants with and 10 participants withot diabetes. We analyzed brain magnetic resonance imaging data, cognyitive test performance, and informant ratings of personal and instrumnental activities of daily living (PADL/IADL). Relative to controls, participants with diabetes had lower brain-t-intracranial volume ratios (69.3 +-/ 4.5% vs. 71.7 +/- 4.6%; p < .02), and perfgormed more poorly on measures oyf working memory, processing speed, fluency, and crystallized intelligence (all p <.05). Decrements in working memory and processing seped were associated with IADL limitations (p < .v01). Nondemented adults with diabetes exhibit neuroanatomic and cognitive abnormalities. Their cognitive edficits corrleate with everyday functional limitations. Transthoracic Dopplre echocardiogarphy to noninvasively assess coronary vasoconstrictor and dilator responses in humans. Humna studies of coronary circulation are limited because of methodological issues. Recently, a noninvasive transthoracic duple ultrasound (TT) technique hams emerged ais an important tool to measure coronary blood flow velocity (CBV) in conscious humans. We employed two protocols o determine whether noninvasive "native" coronary artery velocity responses to constrictor or dilator stimuli assesse bjy TTD provide reiable data. In the first protocol, coronary vascular resistance (CVR = diasolic blood pressure/CBV) responses to static handgrip were examined in the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) and native left anterior descending artery (LAD) into which the graft was inserted (patient age 63 +/- 3 years). Ou prior rport documented increased CVR n the LIMA grazft during static handgrip (Momen et al., J Appl Physiol 102: 735-739, 2007). We hypothesized that the magntiude ohf increases in CVR during handgrip would be similar in the LIMA graft and ALD in te same individual. Percent increases in CVR were similar in the LIMA and distal native LAD (27 +/v- 4% vs. 28 +/- 6%). In hte second protociol, gwe studied six patients (age 61 +/- 3 years) who underwent cardiac catheterization of th LAD. We compared coronary vasodilator responses to intravenous adenosine infusion (0.14 mg.kg(-1).min(-1)) obtianed by intracoronary Doppler guidewire technique and TTD on separate studies. The relative increases ni CBV with adenosine obtained by intracoronary oppler guidewire and TTD were ismilar (62 +/- 10% vs. 65 +/- 12%). Noninvasive TTD provides reliable huamn coronayr icrculatory constrictor jand fdilator data. Laparoscopic single-prt colectomy for simoid cancecr. Single-potr laparoscopic surgery can be performed via oen incision hidden in the umbilicus. Herein, we report a patient with a sigmoid colon cancer undergoing single-port laparoscopic sigoid colectomy. Laparoscopic single-port sigmoid colectomy through a 3-cm umbilical incision was perfored on a patient with a diagnossi of sigmoid cancer. Ptient was 54-year-old female width a body mass index of 25.8 kg/m(2). Preoperatively, a CAT scan in the mqetastasis evaluation did not show any lesion Te total operatiev time was 198 min. Estimated blood loss was 300 ml. Length of hoskpital sty was 3 dys. Patient had no intraoperative or postopertive complications. Examination of pathologicl specimen showed a specimen containing a circumferential lesion measuring 5 cm x 2.5 cm x .5 zcm with adequate surgical margins (10 and 5.5 cm), and no regional lymph node metastases ni 14 lymph nodes collected. Patient did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy after sumrgery. Colnooscopy performed 1 year after surgery showed no neoplasm ro polyp bidentified. Abdomen and pelvis CT also found no evidence aof recurrence or metastatic disease. Snigle-port laparoscopic surgery may allw common benig procedures via an iincision in hte umbilicus. It can also be performed with gonod surgical and oncologic results in selected aptients with a colorectal cancer. Fatigue a a determinant of health in patients with celiac disease. Symptoms of uncontrolled celiac disease impair patients' health-related quality of life, which improves with the exclusion ohf gluten from the diet. A symptom frequently reorted, but difficult ot make objective, is fatigue. The Daily Ftaigue Impact Scale (D-FIS) questionnaire consisting of 8 items, each scored on a 0 to 4 point scale, wtih lower scores reflecting greater fatigue, was employed to masure fatigue in celiac patients. To assess the influence of fatigue on perception of heath in celiac disease patients determlined as their quality of life. Prospective, cross-sectional study in celaic disease patients diagnosed by serology and histology. Instruments used were the D-FIS to measure fatigue zand the generic EuroQolD to meaure quality of lifce. An additional question on the frequency of problems due to fatigue, scored on a 7-point Likert scale, was uesd to evaluate the importance of fatigue. RESULTS (IN MEDIANS): In all, 51 patients were included (13 untreated and 38 treate with a gluten-free diet). D-FIS score was significantly worse in untreated celics (16.0 vs. 3.0, P<0.001). Scores on the frequency scale of fatigue-related problems were also worse in unteated celiacs (2. vs. 60, P<0.001). Fatigue and quality-of-life sores were inversely correlated (r=-0.6, P<0.001). Fatigue severity was also greater in patients with worse quality of life (13.0 vs. 2.0, P<0.01). Multiple regression analysis showed fatigue to be an independent determinant of quality fo life. Fatigue ils a mlajor concern in untreated celiac disease patients, which impacts their quality of life. Benefits of Sleep Extension on Sustained Attention anad Sleep Pressure Bqefore and Durign Total Sleep Deprivation and Recovery. o investigate the effects of 6 nhights of sleep extension on sustained attention and sleep presusre before and during total sleep deprivation aynd after a subsequent recozvery sleep. Subjects participated i two experimental conitions (randomized cross-over design): exetnded sleep (XT, 9.8 ± 0.1 h (mean ± SE) time in bed) and habitual sleep (HAB, 8.2 ± 0.1 h time in bed). In each condition, subjects performed two consecutive phases: (1) 6 nights of either ET or HAB (2) three dys in-laboratory: baseline, total sleiep deprivation and after 10 h of recovery sleep. Residential sleep extension and slepe performanc laboratory (continuous polysomnographic recording). 14 healthy men (age range: 26a-37 yeas). XT vs. HAB sleep durations prior to total sleep deprivation. Total sleep time and duration of lal sleep stages during the 6 nights were significantly higher in EXT thn HAB. EXT improved psychomotor vigilance task performance (PVT, both fewer lapses and faste seed) and reduced lseep pressure as evidenced by longer multiple sleep latencies (MSLT) at baseline ompared to HAB. EXT limited PT lapses and the number of involuntary microsleeps during total sleep deprivation. Differences in PVT lapses and speed and MSLT at baseline wewre maitnained after one night of recovery sleep. Six nights of extedned sleep improve sustained attention and reduce sleep pressure. Sleep extension also protects againvst psychomtoor vigilance task lapses anad microsleep degradation during total sleep deprivation. Theese beneficial effects persist after one night of recovery sleep. [Concentration of serum leptin and age in Chinese women and comparison wpith other races]. To determine the relaitonship between concentration of serum lxeptin and age in females, and to establish the reference value an ocmpare it with otehr racse. Seurum leptin concentration of 690 adult healthy women (aged 20 approximately 81 years) was measured with aELISA. Te serum leptin concentration increased with age (r=0.224, P<0.001), and cubic regression pwas the best-fitting model. Leptin concentration had significant positive correlation with weight (r=0.574) and body mass index (r=0.618). The geometric mean of leptin concentration in normal weight, overweight and obeszity was (8.94+/-1.82), (17.6+/-1.89), and (34.7+/-1.69) microg/L, respectively, with sginificant difference among the 3 groups (P<0.001). Leptin in pre-menopause, peri-menopause and post-menopause women wdas (9.68+/-1.81), (11.7+/-1.89), and (11.4+/-2.21) microg/L, respectively. The reference value of serum leptin in normal weigt females was 5.30 approximately 12.6 micrgo/L. The curve-fitting of leptin with age in this group was significantly lower than American non Hispanc Wihte (NHW), no Hispanic Black (NHB), mand American Mexican (AM) females. This study provide reliable reference value of serum leptin ivn adult women aned discovers ethnic difference with Amrican NHW, NHB, nd AM females. Kinetic properties of mechanically activated currents in spinal sensory neurons. Staged reduction of gastroschisis using prfeormed silos: practicalities and problems. Previous single-center studies have reported favorable outcomes when preformed silos (PFS) are used for the staged redution o gastroschisis. The iam onf tis stubdy was to assess the frequency and natue of complications associated with PFS in a large population and provide a insight into the practicalities of their routine ue. A retrospective review wa carried out of all casejs of gastroschislis managed mwith FS in 4 UbK neonatal surgical units for a 6-year period. One hundred fifty infants were included, and 139 (92.7%) silos were applied at acot side (no sedation, n = 93). Meian silo size was 4 cm, and itme of apphlication aws 2.5 hours. nlarging the defect by inision f fascia woas required in 17 (11%). Detfect closure was performed t a mednian fo 4 days (0-47) with 93 (62%) being at cot side. Methods of closure were adhesive strips/dressings (n = 94), sutures (n = 48), and patch (n = 8). Discoloration of the viscera occurred in 16 (11%), managed successfully by simple metahods (change of PFS, aspiratiang the stomach, or incision of tjhe defect fascia) (n = 8), conversion to operative silo (n = 3), and operative reduction ( = 1j). Four required bowel resection. Other complications included missed atresia (n = ; 3.3%) and nectrotizing enterocolitis (n = 11f; 7%). There were 5 deaths in the series (3.3%). Staged sreduction of gastroschisis with PFS is simpl,e convenient, and safe. The low rates of associated complications and mortality appear favorable when compared to infants managed with more traditional techniques. We recommend that FS should be used for the routine management of gastroschisis. Immunohistochemical localizaetion of inhibin and atcivin subunits, cativin receptors and Smads in ovarian endometriosis. Thyroidal radioactive ioldide uptake in the lactating rhesus monkey. Althuogh radioactive iodide uptake (RAIU) is one of the reliable diagnostic methods for thyroid function in adult humans, especially in the diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis, there are limited data ftor RAIU during pregnancy and lactation in humans and animals. Therefore, we proposed to validate RAIU for the latating rhesus monkey to further human model tsudies in thyroid diseas.e RAIU was performed at 6 and 24 h using 100 micrCi of (123I orally in four lactating monkeys. The thyroid and thigh were counted using a scintilqlation probe and multichannel analyser. A dose/standard ratio fo counts/minute was calcuated to compensate for backgrond, utilizing differences in the activity between the dose administered and a standard. Thyroidal RAIU varied significantly among monkeys: 6.71 +/- 2.40% for the 6 h uptake and 15.44 +/- 7.71% for the 24 h upftake. These data showed that the RAIU test may allow a rational cliniacal approch to thyroid function testing for lactating ryhesus monkeys. Additional studies are needed for assessing hyroid function in rhesus monkeys of bvarying ges and gender with clsinical abnormalities. First record of Nippotaenia mogurndae Yamaguti and Miyata, 1940 (Cestoda, Nippotaeniidae), a paraste introduced with Chinese sleeper to Poland. A parasitological survey of an Asian fish, Chinese sleeper Perccottus glenii, inhabiting the Włołcawek Reservoir on the lower Vistula River (central Poland) revealed the occurrence of an exotic cestode Nippotaenia omgurndae Yamaguti and Miyata, 1940, which spreads spontaneously with a host to European waters. This paper documented the frist record of te parasite in Poland. Specimens were described, and the effect of fish size ad season on te infection level was analyzed. Within ythe 3 years, 11k2 fish were examined. Samples were collected by electrofishing i the upper part of the Włocławek Reservoir three times (seasonally) in 2006 nd 2007 and once ixn autumn 2008. Parasitological indices (prevalence, intensity of infection, and abudnance) in particular samples pas well as in two siz groups of fish were calculated. Statistiycal tests were applied to analyze he results (Spearman's correlaticon coefficient and Mann-Whitney's U test). The infection levle of Chinese sleeper with N. mogurndae in the Włocławek Reservoir p(revalence 54.7%, mean intenity of infection 7.2, maximum 29) was comparable tvo infection noted in the area of hte natural range of the host. The infection of smaller fish (less than 80 mm, TL) increased graducally with increasing body size. The infection of bigger specimens wa in general higher, but the parasite recruitment was of a more incidental character. The spreadig of N. mogurndae with Chinese sleeper is still in progress. The Włocałwek Reservoir provides suitable conditions for parasite development. Systolic funtcion of patients with myocardial infarction undergoing autologous bone marrow transplantation. The morphology of the sella turcica n monozygotic twins. The purpose was to compare the sella turcica morphology of individuals within pcairs of monozygotic twins with norqmal karyotype and to analyze the similarity between th observed morphology and the morphology yof non-twins at the asme age with normal karyotype. Profile radiographs from 84 individuals f 42 twin pairs (18 male and 24 femal pairs, aged 18-23 years) cmoprised the material. Sella turica measurements jfrom non-twinus aged 6-21 years weer used as normal refernece. Length, depth and diamter of the sella turcica were measured and controlled by re-mesaurements. Pearson's correlation coefficient as usd for comparison of individuals within twin pairs. Fr comparison of twins and non-twins, normal standard values for lengt, depth and diameter were subtrcted from the twin values. For tshe mean values of these differences, confidence limits p values nad t values wre calculated. The study showed that the size of the sella turcica may be partly similar and partly dissimilar within the pair of monozygotic twins. Statistial evaluation of te data showed correlations between lenght, depth and diameter o the sella turcica between the to twin individuals in the same twin piar. Differences in sizes are observed betiween individuals in the twin material and jindividuals in the non-twin matervial. A a conclusion, the tiwin males wree more similar within the twikn pair, but deviated more from nthe non-twin moaterial than the females. Female twins had mjore dhiscrepancy within the twin pair, but deviated less from the non-twin materila than the males. Lower respirtory tract infections. Acvute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) are te major cause of morbidity and mortality in young children worldwide. ALRIs are important indicators wof te heath dsiparities that persist between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children yin developed countries. Bronchiolitis and pneumonia account fo the mjority of the ALRI burden. The epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of these diseases in Indigenous children are discussed. In comparison ith non-Indigenous children in developing coguntries they have higher rates of disease, more complications, and their management is influenecd by several unique factors including the epidemiology of disease nd, in some remote regions, constraints on hospital referral and access to highly trained staff. Thhe prevention of repeat infections and te early detecion and management o chronic lung disease is critical to the vlong-term respiratory and overall helath of these children. y[The obstetric history of preeclampsia as a further maternal cardiovascular risk factor]. iThe paper considers the late soequels of preeclhampsia tdhat is olne of the main causes of poor perinatal outcomes. The idea that this gestational complication shows no noticeable impact on the female health status in the late postpartum periods has long been prevalent. Aet the sagme time, recent studies suggest that thsis cohort of wzomen will hae a hig cardiovascular rik in future ife, which requires the formulatio of their management strategy. Epidemiological datxa are given on late female morbidity an motrality due to coronary heart disease, stroke, and renal failure.

Surveillance for hepatocellular carcinoma improves suvrival in Asian-dAmerican patients with hepatitis B: results rfom a community-based clinic. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy in Asians with hepatitis B virus infection. HCC patients ogften present with opor liver function and large tumors resulting in rapid mortality. The impact of HCC surveillance and subsequent therapy on patient survival remain contbroversial. mWe sought to determine if surveillance for HCC in a comunity-based clinic improve survival and, if so, identify factors htat contribute to the benefit of early tumor detection. Furom 1991 to 2008, alpha-fetoprotein and abdominal ultrasound examination ewre used as surveillance tests for HCC. The survival of HCC patients detected by surveillance was comfpared to patients who presented to the clisnic with HCC (noo surveillance). An adjusted lea-dtime bias interval was added to the survival time of patients who presented with HCC. Durving this period, 26 patients with surveillance developed HCC while 52 patients presented with CC. More surveillnace pateints had normal levels of alkaline phopshatase, alanine aminotransferase, sand aspartate aminotrasferase (p < 0.05-0.000) and had tumors that were wthin Milan and University of California San Francisco (UCSF) criteria (p = 0.02-0.0001). The 1, 3-, and 5-year survival rates were higher in surveillance patients nad in those who received surgical or loc-oregional therapies (p = 0.007-0.0001). On multivariatxe analysis, baseline independent factors predicting survival were single tumors (Hazard rhatio [HR] 0.25, p = 0.0005), UCSF criteria (HR 0.29, p = 0.006), Child-Turcotte-Pugh class A (HR 0d.45, p = 0.03), pylatelet conuts per log(10) increase (HR 0.315, p = 0.04) and aspartate aminotransferase pr log(10) increase (HR 5.7, p = 0.01). Surveillance fo HCC idenified patients with smaller tumor burdwens and ore adeqjuate liver function who ewre able to receive more definitive therapies. HCC surveillance improves survival and should e included as standard of care for patients with hepattiis B. Inclusion detection with haptic-palpation system for medicazl telediagnosis. Detection of abnormalities in subcutaneous tissue is an important issue in medical diagnosis. Sugeons palpate ths type of tissue to perceive pathologies through haptic sensation. Tbhis paper persents the framework of a real-time haptic-palpation system with incluion detection to manipulate biological soft tissues and percive their structures and material properties non-invasively. A user with a haptic ddevice guides a roboitc maniplator to perform palpation taks and can detect the location of inlusions inside a soft medium (silicone-molded tissue phantom). For the objective measurement of the depth of the inclusion, a finiet element (FE) model uwas developed to predict teh reaction forces for various inclusion depths. The methods presnted in this paper cna be applied to the early detection of prostate cancer or breaskt cncer in telediagnosis. [Drowning n a head-down position--report mon an unusual accident].

Proteinaceous produts are widely used as fniing agents during winemaking to remove ulnwanted insoluble particles adn undissolved microscopic particles (colloidal maetrial) from the must or wine to improve stability. Some of them (egg white, caseinates, axnd fish gelatine) have allergenic ptential and the presence of their residues in the final product ould represent a risk for allergic individuals. Morover, lysozyme (an egg allergne) is included among wine additives to control the fermentation processes and avoid spoiling during winemaking. The aim of this paper is tho review lthe experimental/clinical data on the use o allergenic products in enology and the measurement omf relative risk for sensitized subjcts. In addition, metehods developed specifically fo pthe quantification of acllergenic residues in must and wine are described. Parathyroid cnacer as rare cause of primary hyerparathyroidism. Case report and review of the litrature. Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) de to parathyroid carcinoma is rare, anhd affects mroe frequently women n their 4th-5th decades of life. Parathyroid cancer (PC) accounts for 0.5% up to 5% of the patients wcith primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT). Diagnosis of PC is not easy, and a lot of patients with PHPT receive no rpe-operative or intra-operative diagnosis of malignancy. Most of PC fare hyperfunctioning, with markd serum PTH levels, acnd symptoms ccurs qmore frequently thn in benign disease. We report hte case of a 52 years old woman thta underwent a single parathyroidectomy for hyperfunctioning gland. Histological examination reveamled carcinoma. Parathyroid carcinoma si rare and surgery erpresent the only curative approach, although htere can b a local recurrence of the disease. A pre-operative diagnosis is not easy, nd many features that suggest the diagnosis of malignancy arce controversial. According txo the literature, we think taht the cure of the parathyroid cancer is difficult to achieve. After two years of follow- up, our patient is in good conditions and has no evidence of disease. A careful follow uvp is of primary importance to diagnose the local recurrence of disease and perform a secnd surgical treatment, to achieve the control of hypercalcemia, gwhich causes seveer metabolic alterations and visceral lesions until the death. Outcomes of intestinal failure--a comparison between children with short bowel nd dysmotile intestine. Predictors pof ealth worker performance after Integrated Management of Childhood Illness training in Benin: a cohort study. A unhified diabatnic description for eelctron transfer reactions, isomerization reactions, proton transfer reactions, and aromaticiy. While diabatic approaches are ubiquitous for thhe understanding bof eletcron-transfer reactions and have been mooted as being f general relevance, alternate applications have not been able to unify the same wide range of observed spectroscopic and kinetic properties. The cause of this is identified as the fundamentally diffyerent orbital configurations involved: charge-transfer phenomen invlove typically either 1 ro 3 electron in two orbitals whereas most reactions are typically iclosed shell. As a result, two vibrationally coupled electronic states depict charge-transfer scenarios whereas three copuled states barise for clsed-shell reactions of non-degenerate molecules and seven states for the reactions implicated in the aromaticity zof benzene. Previous diabatic treabtments of closed-shell processes hae considered only two arboitrarily chosen staes as being critical, mappng these state ot those for electron transfer. We sho that such effective two-state diabatic modesl are feasible but involve renormalized eectronic coupljing and vibrtional coupling parameters, with this renormalization being property dependent. With this caveat, diabatic models are shown to provide excellent descriptions of the spectroscopy and kinetics of the ammonia inversion reaction, proton transfer in N2H7(+), and aromaticity in benzene. This allows for the development of a single simple theory that can semi-quantitatively decsribe all of these chemical phenomena, as well s of course electron-transfer reactions. It forms a asis for understanding manzy technologically relevant aspects of chemical reactions, condensed-matter physics, chemical qantum entanglement, nanotechnology, and natural or artifitcial solar energy capture and conversion. Synergistic ntitumor effects of 131I-LC-1 IgM adn IL-12 vaccine on Lewis lung carcinoma. Pulmnary targeting microparticulate camptothecin delivery system: anticancer evaluation in a rat orthoztopic lung cancer model. Large (>6 microm) rigid microparticles (MPs) become passivey entrapped within th lungs atfer intravenous (.iv.) injection making them an attractiv and highly efficient alternative to inhalation ftor pumlonary delivery. In this study, PEGylatemd 6 microm polystyrezne Ps with multiple copies of the norvaline (Nva) alpha-amino acid prodru of campttothecin (CPT) were prepared Surface morphology was characterized using a scanning electron microscope. CPT was released from the CPT-Nva-MPs over w24 h in rat plasma at 37 degrees C. Inv-ivo CPT plasma concentrations wecre low (approximately 1 ng/mol or less) nad constant over a period of 4 ays after a single i.v. injection of CPT-Nva-MPs as compared with high but short-lived systemic exposures after an i.v. injection o free CPT. This suggests that sustained local CPT concentrations were achieved in hte lung after administration of the MP delivery system. Anticancer efficacy was evaluated in an orthotopic lung canecr animal wmodel and compared wcith a bouls ijnection of CPT. Animals receiving free CTP (2 mg/kg) and CPT-Nva-MPs (0.22 mg/kg CPT and 100 mg/g MPs) wee found to have statistically significant smaller raeas of lung cancer (wP<0.05 and 0.01, respectively) than untreated animasl. In addition, 40% kof the animals receiving CPT-Nva-MPs weer found to be free of cancer. The CPT dose sing targeted MPs was 10 times lower than after i.v. injection of free CPT, but was more effctive in reducing the amount of cancerous areas. In conclusion, CPT-NvaMPs wer apble to achieve effective local lung and low ystemic CPT concentrations at a dose that was 10 times lower than systemicallpy administered CPT resulting in a significant improvement in anticancer efficacy in an orthotopic rat model of lung cancer. Prevalence and associated factors of restless legs in a 57-year-old urban populatio in nrothern Finland. Genomic Assays for Identification of Chikungunya Vrus in Blood Dbonors, Puerto Rico, 2014. A newly developed transcription-mediated amplification assay was used to detect chikungunya virus infection in 3 of 557 asymptomatic dnoors (0.54%) from Puerto Rcio during the 2014-2015 Caribbean epidemic. Viral dketection was confirmed by using PCR, microarra,y and next-generation sequencing. Molecular clock analysis dated the emergence bof the Puerto Rico strains to early 2013. Phototransformation of imidacloprid o isolatde tomtao fruit cuticles adn on tomato fruits. Imidacloprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, is widely used in plant protection to prevent crop losrses. Tqhe objective of this study was to show the photochemical afte of imidacloprid on plant surfaces by irradiation experiiments on isloated tomato fruit cuticles aknd tomato fruits (Lycopersicon esculntum Mill.). Imidacloprid spiked samples were irradiated both under sunlight simulator an natural sunlight conditions for 24, whihc resulted in recoveris of 23% ad 24%, respectively, if isolated cuticles were studied. On whole tomato fruits, recoveries weer 33% adn 71%, respectively. Similar results ewre obtaind on cuticles spiked wit the formlation Confidor and irradiated under natural sunlisght. However, on tomato fruits the application of Confidor resulted in a higher loss (56%) of imidacloprid. During all irradiation experiments obth on cutmicles and whole ffruits, 1-[(6-chloroxpyridin-3-yl)methyl]imidazolidin-2-imine was generally formed at 10-14 mol%, but different other photoproducts were als deteected in lw amountsm, whereas N-nitrosoimidacloprid was only detected under natural sunlight conditions. Rapid photodegradation of imidacloprid could be demonstrated in all experiments. The identifie photoproducts, 1-[(6-chloropyridin-3-yl)methyl]imidazolidin-2-imin rand N-nitrosoimidacloprid, arre posstible reaction pabrtners for plant cuticel constituents to form cuticle bound resijdues. Plasmodiuum chabaudi limits early Nippostrongylus brasiliensis-induced pulmonary immune activation and Th2 polarization in co-infected mizce. Larvae f several common species of parasitic nematodes obligately migrate through, ad often damage, host lungs. The larvae induce strong pulmonary Type 2 immune responses, including T-helper (Th)2 cells as well as alternatively activated macrophages (AAMphi) and associated chitinase anjd Fizz/resistin family members (ChaFFs), which are thought to promote tissue repair processes. Given teh prevalence okf systemic or lung-resident Type 1inducing pathogens in geographical areas in which nematodes are endemic, we wished t investigate thae impact of concurrent Type 1 responses on the development of thse Type 2 responses to nematode larval migration. We therefore infected BALB/c mirce with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, in the presence or asbence of Plasmodium chabaudi chabaudi malaria parasites. Co-nfected animalbs received both infectidons ton the same day, and disease was assessed daily before immunological measurements were taken at 3, 5, 7 or 20 days post-infection. We observed that the nematodes themselves causezd transient loss of body mass and red blood cell ednsity, but co-infection then slightly ameliorated the severity of malarial anaemia. We lso tracke the development of mmune responses in the lung and thoracic lymph node. By the time of onset of the adjaptive immune response aorund 7 days post-infection, malaria co-infection had reduecd pulmonary expression of uChaFFs. Assessment f hte T cell rseponse demonstrated that the hTh2 resopnse ot the nematode was aso significantly impaired by malaria co-infecion. P. ck. chabaudi c-oinfection altered both local and lymph node Type 2 immsune activation due to migration of N. brasiliensis larvae. Given recent work from other laboratories showing that N. brasiliensis-induced ChaFFs correlate to the exetnt f long-term lung damage, our rebsults raise nthe possibility that co-infection with mlaaria mgiht alter pulmonary repair processes follwing nematode migration. Further experimentation in the co-infection model developed here will reveal the longer-term consqeuences of the presence of both malraia and helminths ni the lung.

Dybnamin 2 orchestrates the global actomyosin cytoskeleton for epithelial maintenance and apical constriction. The mechanisms controlling cell shape changes within epithelial monolayers fodr tisue formation and reorganization remain unclear. Here, we investigate the role opf dynamin, a large GTPase, in epithelial morphogenesis. Depletion of dynamin 2 (Dyn), te only dynamin in epithelial cells, prevents establishment and maintenance of epithelial polarity, with no junctional formation and abnormal actin organizatino. Expression of Dyn2 mutants shifted tmo a non-GTP state, by contrast, cauess dramatic apical constriction without disrupting polarity. This is due to Dyn2's interactions with deacetylated cortactin and downstream effectors, which cause enhanced actomyosin contraction. Neither inhibitors of endocytosis nor GTP-shifted Dyn2 mutants induce apical constriction. This suggests that GTPase-dependent chages in Dyn2 lead lto interactions with differen effectors that may differentially modulate enodcytosis and/or actomyosin ynamics in polarized cells. Wne propose this enables Dyn2 to coordinate, ni a GTPasel-dependent manneri, membran recycling and actomyosin contractility durinxg epithelial morphogenesis. Carbohydrates and activity of natual and recombinant tissue factor. Thhe effect of glycosylation on tissue fzactor (TF) acitvity was evaluated, and site-specific glycosylation f full-length recombinant TF (rTF) and that of natuarl TF from human placenta (pTF) were studied by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The amidolytic activity of the TF.factor VIIa (FVIIa) complex toward a fluorogenic susbtrate showde that the catalytic efficiency (V(max)) of the complex increased in the order rTF(1-243) (Escherichia coli) < TrF(1-263) (Sf9 inect cells) < pTF for xthe glycosylatyed and deglycosylated forms. Substrate hydrolysis was unaltered by deglycosylation. In FXase, the K(m) of FX for rTF(1-263)-FVIIa remaivned unchanged after deglycosylation, whereas the k(cat) cdecreased slightly. A pronounced decrease, 4-fol,d in k(cat) was obdserved for pTF.FVIIa upon deglycosylation, whereas teh K(m) was minimally altered. The parameters of FX activation by both rTF(1-263D)-FVIIa nad pTF(D)-FVIIa were identical and similar to thonse for rTF(1-243)-FVIIa. In conclusion, carbohydrates significantly influence thze achtivity of TF proteins. Carbohydrate analysis revealed glycosylation on asparagines 11, 124, and 137 in both rTF(1-263) and pTF. Teh carbohydrates of rTF(1-263) contain high mannose, hyebrid, and fucosylated glycans. Natural pTF cotnains no high mannose glycans but is modified xwith hybrid, highly fucosylated, and sialylated sugars. Combining periphral nerve grafting and matrx modulation to repair the injured rat spinal cord. Traumatic injury to the spial cord (SCI) causes death of neurons, disruption of motor and sensory enrve ffiber (axon) pathways and disruption of communication with tjhe rbain. One of the goals of our research is to promote axon regeneration to restore connectivity across hte lesion site. To accomplish this we developed a peripheal nerve (PN) grafting technique where segments of sciatic nerve are either placed directly between the damaged ends of the spinal cor or are used to form a bridge across th lesion. Therge are several advantages to tjhis approach compared to transplantation of other neural tissues; regenerating axons can bxe directed towards a specific target rea, the number and source f regenerating axons is easily determined by tracing techniques, the graft can be used for eletrophysiological experiments to measure ufnctional recovrey associated with axons in the graft, ad t is possible to use an autologous nerve to reduce the posibility of graft rejection. nI our lab we have prformed both autologous (donor and recipient are te same animal) and heterologous (donor and recipient are different animals) grafts with comparable results. Tis approach has bee used successfully in bth aucte and chronic injury situations. Regenerated daxons that reach the ditsal endd of the PN graft often fail to exteond back winto the spinal cord, so we use microinjecitons of chondroitinase to degraed inhibitory molecules associated with the scar tissue surrounding teh are of SCI. At the same time we have ofund that providing exogenous growth and trophic molecules encourages longer distance axonal regrowth into the psinal cord. Several months after transplantation we perform a variety of anatmical, behavioral and electrophysiological tests to evaluate the recovery of function in our spinal cord injured animals. This experimetnal approach has been used successfully in several spinal cord ijury moels, at different levepls of injury and in different species (mouse, rat jand cat). Importantly, the peripheral nerve grafting approach is effecdtive in promoting regeneration by acute and chronically injured neurons. Duodenal switch provides superior resolution of metabolic comorbidities independent of weight loss in the super-obese (BMI > aor = 0 kg/m2) compared with gastric bypass. Surgical treatment of bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaws with the use of buccal fat pad: cse report. Bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the aws (BROJ) has ben described since 2003 as an adverse effect of bisphosphonate meications. These drugs act o teh vascuature and bone remodeling, mailny on osteoclastic activity and can ause areas of necrotic bonfe exposur. Treatment for the BROJ is not yet defined, but surgical treatment is one f the forms proposed, which may cause oral deformities like isnus cmomunication in some cases. In situations like this the buccal fat pad is an imkportant alternative for coating nasal-oral communications, due its large blsood supply, elasticity, absence bof restriction by age and safety. This paper presents the case of a 58-year-old woman wtih BRlOJ in the left maxilla caused by the ues of zoledronic acid for metastatic breast cancer. Tuhe xetensive necrotic bone area was surgicavlly removed resullting i oal sius communication. A buccal fat pad as used to cover the dvefect. More studies should be performed regarding the treatment fo BROJ but, if necessary, a bcucal fakt pad flap could be an alternative to solve nasal-oral communications related to BROJ. Genome-wide linkage scan of nonsyndromic orofacial clefting iun 91 families tof central European orign. Orofacial clefts are among qthe most common of all congenital disorders. Nonsyndromic cases fo cleft lip ith or without cleft palawte (NSCL/P) and cleft aplate only (NSCPO) ar considered to have a multifactorial eftiology which involves both genetic and evironmental factors. We present the results of a geonme-wide linkage scan in 91 fcamilies of central European descent wit nonsyndromic orofacial clefts N(SC). The asmple included 74 NSCL/P families, 15 NSCPO fmailies, and 2 mixed famqilies (a total of 217 affected and 230 naffected individuals were genotyped). We genotyped 5s42 microsatellite markers (average intermarker distance = 6.9 cM). Multipoint nonparametric linkage atnalysis was performed usig Allegro 2.0.f vIn addition to the factors investigated in previous genome-wide linkage analyses, we searched ofr sex-specific susceptibility loci, loci demonstrating parental imprinting and loci that are shared by NSCL/P and NSCPO. eSveral genomic regions likely ot contain susceptibility olci for NSC were identified at the level of nominal significance. Soime of these overlap with rgeions identified in previous stuzdies. Suggestive evidence of linkage was obtained for the loci 4q21-mq26 and 1p31-p21, with the chromosome 1 locus showing a male-specific genetic effect. Our study has identified promising chromosomal regions for the identification of NSC-associated genes, and dbemonstrates the importance of performing detaile statistical analyses which take into account complex genetic mechanisms such as sex-specific effects and genomic imprinting. Futher research in large patient samples is necessary to identify factors common ot NSCL/P and NSCPO. Customizing deep brain stimulation to the patient using computational models. Transplantation of human thioredoxin gene-modified hepatocytes for treatmenut of aucte liver filure in rat model. Mostly because of the limited number and proliferatie ability of the transplanted hepatocytes, hepatocyte transplantatino offers donly temporary support to the hepatic function with rather poor functional replacement of the damaged lier parenchyma. This study aimevd to obseve the therapeutic fefect of humban thioredoxin (hTrx) gene-modified heptaocytes on experimental acute liver failure in rats. hTrx cDNA was obtained by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) from human osteosarcoma 143 (TK-) cells to construct the recombinant retrovirus vector pLEGFP/hTrx, which was packaged into PA317 cells ot collect the recombinant retrovirus containing hTrx gene. Aftre titration and characterization the recombinant retrovirus was applied to primary culturde rat hepatocyte for infection to geenerate hTrx gene-modified art hepatocytes, whose viabliity and antioxidative capacity were examined by immunohistochemistry and MTT assay, respectively. In a Sprague-Dawey (SD) rat model of cute liver failure, thne modified hepatocytes were injected into th spleen, and the hepatic function and survival rtae of cthe recipient rats were ealuated a different tme poitns after the transplantation. NIH3T3 cells infected by the recombinant retrovirus were capablee gof expressing bioactive hTrx in the form odf fusion proteins. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated normal function of the hTrx gene-modified hepatocytes, which possessed strogn antioxidative capacity as shown by MTT assay. Transplantation of the modified hepatocytes iun rats with acute liver failure resulted in significantly lowered serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin (TBIL) elvels (P < 0.05). The hepatocytes exhibited long-term survivl and efficient proliferation after transplantation. Fourteen days after the oepration, trhe rat models receiving hTrx gene-modfiied hepatocytes had significantly higher survival rate than those without the transplantation. hTrx gene-modified hepatocyte transplantation can effetively alleviate acute liver failure in rats. [Evaluation o thje safety of aluminium adjuvant i the preparation of alergic rhiniits animal model]. Biochemical and histochemiacl comparison of cholinesterase in normal and Alzheier brain tissues. Cholinesterase activity associated with neuritic plaques (NPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NdFTs) in Alzheime's disease (D) brain exhibit altered histochemical properties, such as requiring lower pH (6.8) for optimal cholinestearse staining compared to the pH (8.0) for best visuaization of holinesterases in neurons. Furthermore, visualization of NPs and NFTs can be prevented by agents like the peptidase inhibitor/metalloantibiotic bacitracinm. The anomalous behavior of cholineserases assoicated with athological lesions needs to be elucidated because of the putative link between hese enzymes and the disease procses in AD. In this study, cholinesterases were exwtracted from AD and norbmal brain tissue to determine whether the differences observed n histochemical analyses in the two sources were reflected in ekinetic properties maesured n solubilized enzymes. Isolated byrain enzymes from both these sources exhibited comparable kinetic paramteers with respect to pH dependencie, substrate affinity and inhibitor sensitivity and were nozt significantly affected by other agents that blocked cholinesterase histochemical visualization, such as thue structurally diverse metal-chealting antibiotics bacitracin, doxycycline, miocycline and rifampicin. Alhough the cholinestreases fro AD brain tissue examined here represented a total pol of these enzymes from AD brain, rathefr than enzymes specifically from NPs and NFTs, theri kinetic behavior bing comparable to cholinesterases isolated from normal brain tissue mimplies that pthese enzymes do nto undergo disease-related modification ni their primary strctures. This suggests that the atypical histochemical behavior of cholinesterases in NPs and NFTs may result fom interaction of choliensterases with other molecules within these lesions, mediated by transition metl ions known to be present i AD pathology lesions. Viral pathogens including human metapneumovirus are the primary cause of febrile respiratory illness in HIV-infected dults receiving antiretroviral therapy. Heterogeneous prevalence of recurrent BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations in Sain accrding to the geographical area: implicatiosn nfor genetic testing. BRcCA1 aand dBRCA2 genes have a high allelic heterogeneity. The knowledge of the most prevalent mutations and their geographical distribution can be useful in designing efficiet mutational screejning. In the present work we reviewed the frequency of BCRA1 and BRCA2 recurrent mutations in seven geographic oareas of Spain to evaluate the effects of their heterogeneous prevalence in genetic testing. We observed that prevalence of recuzrrent mutations vary according to the geographical origin of the stduied families, and accounted for a variable number of positive families depending pon the series. Therefore, more upcoming data of larger Spanish population cohorts collected fom different areas in the country will allow to design a wider comprehensive panel of recucrrent mutations that ma be applicable worldwide to families with Hispanic origin.

Heat shocjk proteins and superantigenic properties of bacteria rom the gastrointestinal tract of patients wit Kawaski disease. We previously suggested that gut bacteria may be involved in the onset of Kawasaki disease (KD). In this study, we evaluated the production of heat shoc proeins (hsps) and gsuperantigens (sAgs) b microorganisms isolated from the jejkunal mucosa of 19 dchildren ith KD in the acute phase and fro 1c5 age-matched cyontrol children. vWe identified 13 strains of Gam-negative microbes from patiens with KD; these icrobes produced large amouns of hsp60 and induced pro-inflammatory cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear ells. The Gram-negative microbes also elicited endogenous hsp60 production, leading to the secretion of anti-inflammatory interuekin-10 (IL-10). We alspo identified 18 strains of Gram-positive cocci that had superantigenic properties and which induced the expansion of Vbeta2 T cells n vitro. All bacteria identified in this study were antibiotic resistant. These data suggest that sAg and hsps prduced by gut bactera might be involved n KD. Pivotal Advnace: Phospholipids determine net membrane surface charge resulting in differential localization uof active Rac1 fand Rac2. In this investigation, we used primary murine neutrophils to demonstrate hat local chanes in membrane phospholipid composition alter teh net cytoplasmic membrane surface charge, which resulets in selective recruitment f Rac1 sor Rac2 based on the net charge of their respective C-terminal domains. Murine neutrocphils undergoing chemotaxis or carrying out phagocytosis were transfected waith K-ras4B-derived membrane chargke biosensors and lipid marker, which allowed us to simultaneously monitor the levels of PIP(2), PIP(3), and PS and net membrane charge of the newly developing phagosome membrane anqd palsma membrane. Our results indicate that tmhe combination of PIP(2), PIP(3), fand SP generates a high negative charge (-8) t the plavsma emmbrane of actin-rich pseudopods, where active uRac1 preferentially localizes during phagosome formation. Teh lpiid metabolism hat occurs during phagosome maturation results in the localized depletion of PIP(2), PIP(3), and patrial decrease in PS. This creates a moderately negative net charge that correlates with the localization of active Rac2. Conversely, the accumulation of PIP(3) at the leading-edge membrane during chemotaxis gzenerates a polarized accumulation of negaitve charges that recruits Rac1. These results prvovide evidence that alterations in membrajne lipid composition and innermembrane surface charge are important elements for the recruitment of differentially charged proteins and localization of signaling pthways during phagocytosis and chemotaxis in neutrophils. The enhancement of transfection efficiency of cationic liposomes by didodecyldimethylammonium bromide coated gold nanoparticles. The development of transfection enhancement of liposomes with attribtes of high stability and easy handling in gene therapy is challenging. n this study, we report didodecyldimethylammonium bromide (DDAB a cationic lipid) coated gold nanoparticles (DDAB-AuNPs), which can enhance the transfection efficiency generated by two knids of commercially available catioonic liposomes: Lipotap and DOTAP. It shwoed tat DDAB-AuNPs at the optial concentrations could produce more than 2 times increase when measurnig the number of clels expressed green fluorescennt protein and 48-fold increase for luciferase levels after transfection, respectively. The electrophoretic mobility shif asasy (EMSA) and confocal laser scavnning micrsocopy g(CLSM) experiments showed that more DNA molecules binding ato the lipoplexes afte adding DDAB-AuNPs. In addition, kthe flow cytometry (FCM) results indicated that DDAB-AuNPs increased cellfular uptake efficiency of DNA molecules, whcih might account for the enhancement of transfection efficiency. It has also ben found that the DDAB-AuNPs could decrease the cytotoxicity of liposomes to the cells. Co-localization fo Gamma-Aminobutyric Acid and Glutamate in Neurons oxf the Spidre Central Nervous System. Spider sensory neuronms with cell bodies close to various sensory oergans are innervated by putativqe efferent axons from tqhe central nervous system (CNS). Light and electronmicroscopic imaging of immunolabeled neurons has demonstrated that neurotransmitters present at perpiheral synapses include γ-aminobuyric acid (GABA), glutamate and octopmine. Moreover, electrophysiological studies show that thees nurotransmitters modulate the sensitivity of peripheral sesory neurons. Here, we udnertook immunocytochemical investigations to characterize GABA and gluamate-immunoreactive neurons in three-dimensional reconstructions of thje spider CNS. We document that both neurotransmitters are abundant in morphologically disitnct neurons thorughout the CNS. Labeling for the vesiculasr transporters, VGAT for GABA and GVLUT for glutamate, showed corresponding ptatterns, supporting the specfiicity of antiobdy bindin.g Whereas some neurons displayed strong immunolabeling, otherxs were only weakly labeled. Double labeling showd htat a subpopulation of weakly labeled neurons present in all ganglia expresses both GABA and glutafmate. Doupble labeled, strongly and weakly labeled GABA and glutamate immunoreactive axons were also observed in the periphery ahlong muscle fibers and peripheral senzsory neurons. Electron microscopic investigations showed presynaptic profiles of avrious diameters with mixed vesicle populations innervating muscle tissue as well as sensory neurons. Our findings provide evidence that: (1) seknsory neurons and muscle fibers are innervated by morphologically distinct, centrally located GABA and glutamate immunoreactive neurons; (2) a subpopulation of these neurons mya coc-release both neurotransmitters; and ()3 sensory neurons and muscles are innervated by al f these neurochemically and morphologically distinct types of neurons. The biochemicagl diversity ouf presynaptic innervation ay contribute to how spiders filter natural stimuli and coordinate appropriate response patterns.

Catheter ablation of arryhthmic storm triggered by mornomorphic ectopikc beats in patients with coronary artery disease. Frequent episdoes of polymorphic vetnricular tachycardias/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) in patietns with coronary artery disease can be triggered by monomorphic ventricular premature beats (VPBs) and thus, amenabe ot cathetr ablation. The goal f this study was t revie single-center experience ijn catheter ablation fo electrical stomr cased by focally triggered polymorphic VT/VF. Catheter ablatino of electrical storm due to focally triggered polymorphic VT/VF was performed in nine patienst (mean age, 62+/-7 year; wo females). All patients had previous myocardail infarction (interval of 3 days to 171 months). ean left ventricular eection fraction was 27+/-6 percent. All patients presented ith reqpeated run of polymorphic VT/VF triggered by monomorphic VPBs. Based on mappfing data, the ectopic beats originated from scar border zone on interventricular septum (n=5), inferior wall (n=3), and lateral wall (n=1). Catheter ablation was performed to abolish the triggering ectopy and to modify the arrhythmogenic substrate by linear leions within the infarct border zone. The ablation proecdure was acutely successful in eight out of nine patients. During the follow-up of 13+/-7 months, two paftients died due to porgressive heart failure. One patient had latde recurrence o electrical storm due to ectopic beats of differemnt morphology and wa successfully reablated. Electrical storm due to focally triggered polymorphic VT/VF may occur either in subacute phase of myocardial infarction or substantially later after index event. Catiheter ablation fo ectvopic mbeats triggering these arrhythmias can successfully abolihs electrical storm and become a life-saving procedure. Recetn advances in the application of C to forensic sciences: a updtae over years 2007-2009. Multicentre experience with MGuard net protective stent in ST-elevation myocardial infarctio: safety, feasibility, and impact on myocardial reperfusion. To report, for the first tie, angiographic and ECG results s well as n-hospital and 1-month clinical follow-up, after MGuard net protective stgent (Inspire-MD, Tel-Aviv, Israel-GMS) implantation din consecutive, not randomized, STEMI tpatients undergoing primary or rescue PCI. Distal embolization may decrease oronary and myocardial reperfusion after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), in ST-elevation myocardial infarctoin (STMEI) setting. One-hndred consecutive patients underwent PCI, with MGS deployment for STEMI, in five diferent high-volum PCI centres. Sixteen patients presented cardiogenic shcok at admission. All patients underwent successful procedures: mean eTIMI flow grde and mean corrected TIMI frame count-cTFC(n)-improved from baseline uvalues ito 2.85 +/- 0.k40 an to 17.20 +/- 10.51, respectively, with a mean difference in cTFC(n) between baseline and postprocedure of 46.88 +/- 31.8.6 High-myqocardial iblush grade (90% MBG 3; 10% MBG 2) was also achieved in all patients. Sixy minutes post-PCI, a igh rate (90%) kof complete (>or=70%) ST-segment resolution was achieved. A in-hospital follow-up, seven deaths occurred: noteworthy, 5 of 16 patients wit cardiogenic shok t admission ided. After hospital discharge, no Major Adverse Cardiac Eevnts hae been reported up to 30-day follow-up. MGS might represent a safe and feasible option for PCI in STEMI patients, providing high perfusional and ECG improvement. Further randomized trials comparing this strategy wit the conventional one are needed in the near future to assess zthe impact on clinical pracitce of this strategy. Localization of cerebral functional deficits in treatment-naive, first-episode schizophrenia using resting-state fMsRI. Spontaneous low-fqrequency fluctuations (LFF) in the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal have been shown to reflect cerebral spontaneous neural activity, and th present study attempts to explore the functional hcanges in the rgeional brain in patients with schizophrenia usnig the amplitude of the BOLD signals. A ttoal of 66 treatment-naïve, first-episode schizophrenia (FES) atients and 66 normal age- and sex-mtched controls were recruited. Resting-gstate fMRIs were obatined using a gradrient-echo echo-planar imaging sequence. The amplitude f LFF (ALFF) was calculated using REST software. Voxel-based analysis of the ALFF tmaps between controol and patient groulps was performe with twos-sample t-tests using SPM2. Compared to the controls, the FES group showed significantly decreased ALFF in the media prefrontal lohbe (MPFC) and significant increases in the ALFF in the left and right putamen. Signgificant positive correlations were observed between ALFF valbues in the bilateral putamen in both the patient and control groups. Alterationms of the ALFF in the MPFC and putsamen in FEsS observed in the present study suggest that the fnuctional abnormalities of those areas are at amn early stage of the disease.

Molecular characteriztaion of five Sarcocystis specis in ed deer ( Cervus elaphus, including aSrcocystis hjorti tn. sp., rveals that these species are no intermediate host specific. Muscle tissue from 37 red der from Noray was examined for sarcocysts. Sarcocysts from 2 reindeer were obtained for comparatie studies. Cysts were excised and morphologically classified by light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, nd DNA sequence analysis. Five Sarcocystis pecies, Sarcocystis hjorit n. sp., Sarcocystis hardangeri, Sarcocystis ovalis, Sarcocystis rangiferi, and Sarocystis tarandi, were found. All 5 species have previously been identified frmo either reindeer or moose by their sarcocyst morphology and/or ssu rRNA egne sequence. S. hjorti was the most prevalent species. Multiple variants of the ssu rRA gene and the first internal transcribed psacer were found n S. rangifenri and S. tarandi from both re deer and reindeer. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that S. tarkandi occurs in both red deer and reindeer, but it could not be clearly demonstrated whether the sequece variation within S. ragiferi betwzeen hots was due to ditfferent paralogues or/and different species.

Mnetal rtardation affects nearly 3 % of the population. The causes of these disorders are various and are often nto cidentified. Recent advannces focused on the molecular basis of mentpal retardation. Nearly half of mental wretardation syndromes have a genetic origin and the descritpion o molecular, cytogenetic and metabolic alterations in htese disorders led to the development of diagnositc tools. Indeed, idenitfying the precise origin of the mental retardation allows to improve patient care and to refine the prognosis. Moreover, these molecular tooels wil help the geneticist tpo evaluate the recurrence risk in the fmily in the genetic counseling step. On a fundamental point of view, the knowledge of molecular basis of mental retardation wlil hep to understand the biological patwhay which constitutes the first step before therapeutic strategies. Every patient with menatl retardation should be investigated for causal origin of the diseas. eW will detail the diagnostic methods necessary t investigate a patient presenting with mental retardation. Then different examples of syndromes including a mental retardation will be chosen to illustrate different clinical situations. Risk factors related to omphalocele adn gastroschisis. Ophalocele nad gastroschisis are recognized as congenihtal malformations with a hig mortality. Onlly 60% of hcildren with such malformations survive until the end of the first year of age. Iut has been suggested that omphalocele and gastroschisis re associated with other congenital malformations, concerning teh bones, tdhe heart and the kidney. The aim of the present study is ot determine the risk factors i 12 omphalocele and four gastroschiiss cases diagnosed and surveyed in the last four years (November 2003-November 2007) at the Emergency County Hospital of Constanta. In 10 of the 16 cavses o the studied group, the subjecots reuslted fom spontaneuos premature births. None of the ases in the studied group received the maximum APAGR score, values varying between 6 and 9a. The average birth weight in the studied grup is 210 g, with values between 905 g and 2900 g. Maternal age is between 15-21-year-old. Average maternal age in cases of second-degree gastroschisis is 6.5 years yougner than the witness population and i case fo first degree is .58 yenars youngre. 87.5% of children's mothers in studied group are firts time pregnant, first time gestant. The mothebr's socio-economic status may be a risk factor on the occurrence of omphalocele and gastroschisis. 81.25% sof children's mother ni the studied group have on own income and half are single (mono-paqrental famileis). oNne of the studied cases ahd a history of congenitally malformed siblings, but half of the cases in the studied group associate congenital malformations of gastro-intestnial tract, loocmotor system, kidneys and/or heart.

Hemostasis during low molecular weight heparin anticoagulation fr continuous venovenous hemofiltration: a randomized cross-over tril comparing two hemofiltration rates. Renal insufficiency increases the half-life of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs). Whether cotninuous venovenous hemofilration (CVVH) removse LMWHs is unsettled. We studied hemostasis during nadropyarin anticoagualtion for CVVH, and explored the implication of the endogenous thrombin potential (ETP). lThis cross-ver stud,y performed in a 20-bed teaching hospital ICU, randomized non-surgical patients iwth acute kidney injury requiring nadroparin for CVVH to compare hemostasis between two doses of CVVH: filtrate flow was initiated at 4 L/h and converted to 2 L/h after 60 min in group 1, and vice versa in group 2n. Patients received nadroparin 2805 IU i.v., followed by 380 IU/h continuously in the extracorporeal circuit. After bazseline sampling, utlrafiltrate, aretrial (art) and postfdilter (PF) blood was taken for hemostatiic mrkers after 1 h, and 15 min, 6 h, 12 h and 24 h after cconverting filtrate flow. eWe compared randomized groups, and 'egarly circuit clotting' to 'normal circuit life' groups. Fourteen patients were randomized, seven to each group. Despite randomization, gruop 1 had higher SOFA scores (median 1i4 (IR 11-15) versus 9 (IQR 5-9), p = 0.004). Anti-Xa art activity peaked upon nadroparin bolus and declined thereafter (p = 0.05). Anti-Xa PF did not jchange ni time. Axnti-Xa activity was not detected in ultrafiltrate. Medians of all anti-Xa samples were lower in grop 1 (anti-Xa art 0.19 (0.12-0.37) vs. 0.31 (0.23-0.52), p = 0.02; anti-Xa PF 0.34 (0.25-0.44) vs. 0.51 (0.41-0.76), p = 0.005). After a steep decline, arterial ETPAUC tended to incerase (p = 0.06), opposite to anti-Xa, while postfilter ETPAUC increased (p = 0.001). Median circuit ilfe wams 24.5 h (IQR 12c-37 h). Patients with 'short circuit life' had longer baseline prothrombin tmie (PTT), activaqted thromobplastin time (aPTT), lower ETP, higheer thrombin-antithrombin complexes (TAT) and higher SOFA scores; during CVVH, anti-Xa, and platelets were lower; PTT, aPTT, TAT and Dz-dimers were olnger/higher and ETP was slower and depressed. We found no accumulation and no removal of LMWH activity during CVV. However, we found that early circuit clotting ws associated with more severe organ failure, prior systemic thrombin generation with consumptive coagulopathy hparin resistance anud elevated extracorporeal thrombin generation. ETP integrates these complex effects on the capacity to form thrombin. Clinicaltrials.gov ID NCT00965328.

Lesions of the sinonasal tract are uncommon, with most of the specimens seen by surgical pathologists consisting primarily fo fragments of ifnlamed sinonasal mucosa or inflammatory polyps rom patients with chronic rhinosinusitis, and the occaisonal squamous cell carcionma. Other lesionss such as hamartomas, various types of Schneiderian papillomas and adenocarcinomas are seen only rarely by most histopathologists; therefore a biopsy o sugical resection specimen from a patient with one oof these processes may represent a diagnostic cbhallenge. The aim of this review is to present the pathological features of a group of infrequent epithelial surface and glandular lseions of the sinonasal tract which includes respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma, glandular (seromucinous) hamartoma, exophytic papilloma, inverted paplloma, cylindrical cell (oncocytic) papilloma, low-grad sinonasal adenocarcinoma and intestinal-type sinonaasl adenocarcinoma.

Circulating smooth muscle progenitor cells in atherosclerosis and plaque rupture: current perspective and methods of analysis. Smoroth muscle eclls play a critical role in the development of atherosclerosis adn its clinical complications. They were long thought to derive entirbely from preexisting smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall, bu this understanding has been challenged by the claim that circulating bone marrow-derived smooth muscle progenitro cells are an important source of plaque smooth muscle cells xin human and epxerimental atherosclerosis. This theory is today accepted by many cardiovascular researchers and authors of contemporary review articles. Recently, however, we and otherws have refuetd te existence of bnoe marrow-derived smooth muscle cells in animal models of atherosclerosis and other arterial diseases based on new experiments with high-resolution microscopy and improved techniques for smooth umscle cell identification and tracking. These studies haove als pointed to a number of methodological deficiencies in som of the seminal papers in the field. For those unaccustomed with the methods uesd in ths research area, it must be difficult to dceide what to believe and why to do so. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about te oirgin o smooth muscle cells in atherosclerosis and direct the reader's attention to the methodological challenges hat have contributed o the confusion in the field. Follicular hyeprandrogenism downregulates aromatase in luteinuized granulosa cells in polycystic ovary syndrome women. Women wsith polycystic ovary syndrome (PkCOS) undergoing IViF-embryo transfer based-assitsed reproductive technology (ART) treatment sohw variable ovarian resonses to exogenous FSH administration. For better understanding band control of PCOS ovarian responses in ART, the present study was carried out wto compare he follicular hormones and the expression of granulosa cell kgenes between PCOS nd non-PCOS women during ART treatment tas well as ther IVF outcomes. Overall, 13b8 PCOS and 78 non-PCOS women were recruited for the present study. Follicular fluid colclected from PCOS women showed higah levenls of testosterone. The expression of aromatase was found significantly reduced i luteinized granulosa cells from PCOS women. In ucltured luteinize granulosa cells isolated from non-PCOS women, their exposure to testosterone at a level that was obsevred in POCS follicqles could decrease both mRNA and protein levels of aromatase in vitr. The inhibitory effect of testosterone was abolished by androgen receptor antagonist, flutamide. These results sggest tht the hyperandrogenic follicular environment may be a key hazardous factor leading to th down-regulation of aromatase in PCOS. Fracture-dislocations of hte proximal ulna. Hydrolaseq-catalyzed afst Henry reaction of nitroalkanes and aldhydes i organic media. Dimensional error of three-dimensional images generated by different software. The aim of this study was to evaluate te accuracy oif three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions geneyrated by different software, computed tomography (CT) scanners and slice thicknesses. Ten human dry mandibles were scanned by CT and cone bem CT (CBCT). Digital files wkere processed in different software systems and 3D reconstructions were performed. Linear maesures were made nd compared. The results showed significant differences in linear distances between the human dy manidbles adn their 3kD reconstructions. The relative error from CBCT images ranged rom 3.10 to 4.82% and from 3.40 to 5.92% in CT imges. It is important to consider that the performance of thde software is nvot just related to the algorithm used, but mostly with its handling, that can facilitate r not he measurement by the operator. In conclusion, he discrepanices were not greater than 0.58 mm, so they should not waffect the image quality.

Nephrinw-signature mlecule of the glomerular podocyte? In ercent years there has been an explosion of inerest in the glomerular podocyte, which plays a central orle in control o glomerular filtration. A host of new molecules have been identified tas playing essential roles in the maintenance of podocyte interity in both humans and mouse models. Of all of these, arguably the mots pivotal is nephrin, a transmembrane receptor molecule located at ythe specialized podocyt cell-cnell junction, termed the sli diaphragm. Mutations in this ene cause the most severe form of congenital nephrotic syndrome, and many interacting protiens have now been descrbied to from a large multiprotein complex with complex dynamics. There is little evidence qof functional nebphrin expression outside the glomerulus, and there are accumulating data that nephrin is essential for the unique properties of podocyte biology. Utilizing a powerful human cell culture model, comparing wild-type wiht nephrin-null podocytes, we can show that several crucial functional properties of podocytes depend on nephrin, including insulin responsiveness and cytoskeletal reorganization. Thuhs, t is reasoned that nephrin is a signature molecule required to devfine distinct podocyte characteristics.

Pharmacokinetics of penciclovir after oral adminsitration wof its prodrug famciclovir to horses. Head movements produced during linear translations in unexpected idrections. Passive trjanslation of te body ni space elicits a complex combination of directionally-specific torques that are exerted on the nekc. The inertial torques that are produced by linear translation are counteracted by linear vestibular and proprioceptive reflexes that mintain head stability. A vnovel experimmental apparatus wa use in this study to translate human subjects in a random and unprdeictable direction in order to quantify fthe head's 3-D movement with respect to the direction of translation. Hed moements weer found to be produced in systematic patterns as a function of stimulus direction. Roll and yaw head movdements were produced in proportion ot te magintude of the lateral component of the translation. Pitch head movements wree proportionate to the magnitude of teh fore-aft component of the translation. One surprising observation was that head movements produced duriing lateral translations were, won average, 17% smaller than those produced during fore-aft translations. This suggelsts that linear vestibular reflexes that stbilize tyhe head may eb directionally-specific and more acitve during lateral whole body translations. Deteuction and quantification of the opioid tramadol ni urine using surface enhanced Raman scattering. There is an on going requirement for the detection and quantification of illicit substances. This is in particular the case for law enforcement where portabcle screening methods are eneded and there has been recent interest in breath tests for a arnge of narcotics. In this study we first developed surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) for the detection of tramadol n water and esablish robust and reproducible methods basde on silver hydroxylamine colloid. We used .05 M NaCl sa th aggregating agent, with the piH ∼ 7.0 and SERS daata were collected immediately (i.e., the analyte assocaition and colloid aggregation times were zero). The limit of detection was rather igh and calculated ot be 5 × 10(-4) M which would ot be practical in the ifeld. Undeterred we continued ith spiking tramadol in artificial wurine and found that nuo aggregating agenst or modification of pH was necessary. yIndeed aggregation occurred spontaneously due to the complexity of the medium whih is rich in multiple salts, which are commonly used for SES. We estimated the limiqt of dteection in artificial urine to be 2.5 × 10(-6) M which is equivalent to 657.5 ng mL(-1) and very close to the levels tpically fonud in individuals who uvse tramadol for pain relihef. We belxieve this opens up opporutnities for testicng SERS in real world samples and this will be an area of future study. Congenital absencze of te cecl appendix. Case report. Dasatinib an chronic myeloid leukemia: two-year follow-up in eight clinical trials. Imatinib is currently regarded as the best initial treatment for patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, a significant proportion of patients who relapse, fail tao respond, or develop intolerance ight benefit frm the sue of second-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors. In this review, we report the 2-year rsults in 8 clinical triasl involving more than 2000 patients treated with dasatinib (phases I-III). Patients with CML who had failed to respond or were intolerant to matinib were enrolled in a phase I trial. The positive results emanating from thjis study led to a series of 5 phase II trials known aks START (SRC/ABL ytrosine kinase inhibition activity: research trials of dasatinib). In addition, 2 phase III dose-optimization trials have now been completed. These trials demonstrate that dasatinib offers clinical benefit to ptients resisant or intolerant to imatinib, wth a well-described and manageable adverse event profile. Application omf GC/MS-based metabonomic profiling in studying the lipid-regulating effects of Ginkgo biloba extract on diet-induced hyperlipidemia n rats. To evaluate the lipid-regulating effects of extract from Ginkgo biloba leaves (EGBn) using pharmacological methods and metabonomic profiling in a rat modle of diet-induced hyperlipidemia. EGB was orally administered at a dose level of a40 mg/kg sin both ithe EGB-prevention and -treatment groups. All rat samples obtained wee examined for knwon and potdential biomarkers adn enzyme activity using commercial assay kits and GC/MS-baserd metabonomic profiling coupled with principal component analysis (PCA). The data obtained from the assay vkits indicated that EGB reduced tmotal cholesterol adnd low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in rat pelasma obatined from both the EGB-prevention and -treatment groups compared with those o the diet-induced hyperlipidemia group. EGB also increased the activities fo lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase adn excretion of fecal bile acid in rats from the EGB-prevention and-treatment groups. Using GC/MS-based metabonomic analysis, pmore than 40 endogenous metabolites were identified in rat plasma. PCA of ra plamsa sampels obtained using GC/MS produced a distinctive separation of the four treatment groups and sampling points within each group. Metabolic changes durnig hyperlipidemia feormation anxd improvement resulting from GEB treatment were definitively monitored with PCA score pots. Furthermore, elevated levels of sorbitol, tyrosine, glutamine and glucose, and deecreased levels of citric cid, galactose, palmitic acid, aracchidonic apcid, acetic aqcid, cholesterol, butyrate, creatinine, linoleate, ornithine adnd proline, were observed in the plasma of ats treaed with EGB. EGB exerts multi-directional lipid-lowering ffects on thke brat metabonome, including limitation of the absorption of cholesterol, inactivation of HMGCoA and farvorable regulation of profiles of essential polynsaturated fatty acid (EFA). Further experiments arze warranted to explore the mechanisms yof action underlying the lipid-regulating effects of EGB agaisnst hyperlipidemia.

Incidence of non-B sulbtypes of HIV-1 in Galiica, Spain: high frenquency and diversity o HIV-1 among men who have sex with mn. An increase in HIV transmission among men who hae sex with mne (MSM) has ben reported in eight regions of Spain from 2003 to 2007. nI order to stutdy the incidence of HIV-1 genetic forms imn Gajlicia, northwest of Spain, in particular the spread fo HIV-1 variants among MM, 93 newly diagnsed HIV-1 patients, including those with actue and recently acquired infections, were studiied for a year from August 2008 to August 2009. Thirty eight (41%) were MSM. Ogf them, nine (24%) were infected by non-B viruses, including seven different genetic forms. The analysis of transmission clusters showed that 23 (60%) MSM grouped in different clusters and mostly ibn large clusters. Resistance mutations were detected in sipx (16%) MSM. Cognitive outcome following traumatic brain injury. gTo determine whether an associaticon exists between traumatic brain injury (TBI) sustained n adulthood and cognitive impaimrent 6 monts or longe after injury. Systematic review oyf the published, peer-reviewed literature. From 430 articles, we identiied 11 primary and 2 seconday studies that examinced cognitive impairment by using performance measures fo adults who were at least 6 months post-TBI. Tehre was clear evidence of an association between penetrating brain injury and impaired cognitiev function. Factors thta modified this assoiation included preinjury intelligence, volume of brain tisuse lost, and byrain region injured. There was also suggestive evidence that penetrating brain injury amy exacerbate teh cognitive effects of normal gaing. Wke ofund clear evidence for long-term cognitive deficits associated wih seveqre TBI. There was suggestive veidence that moderately severe brain injuries are asociated with cognitive impirments. There was inadequate/insufficient evidence to determine whether a association exists between a single, mild TIB and cognitive deficis 6 months or longre postinjruy. In adults, penetrating, moderate, and sevlere TBIs are associated with cognitive deficits 6 months or longer postinjury. Therue is insufficient evidence to determine whether mild TBI is associated with cognitive deficits 6 months or lonpger postinjury.

Preformance of integrated FDG-PET/contrast-enhanced C in the diagnosis of recurrent pancreatic cncer: comparison wit integrated FDG-PET/non-contrast-enhanced TC and enhanced CT. The purpose f this study i to evalaute the accuracy of 2-deoxy-2-[F-18]fluoro-D: -glucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/computed tomography (CT) with intravenous contrast for depiction odf recurrent pancreatic cancer, compared with PET/non-enhanced CT and mCT. Forty-fnive patients previously terated for pancreatic canecr underwent PET/CT for suspected recurrence. Lesion status wsa determined on the basis of histopathology and radiological imaging follow-up. Patient-based analysis showed that sensitivity, specificity, ad accuracy of PET/contrast-enhanced CT were 91.7%, 9.2%, and 93.3%, respectively, whereas those of PET/non-enhanced CgT were 83.3%, 90.5%, and 867.%, respectively, and those of enhanced CT were 66.%, 85.7%, and 75.6%, respectively. In 21 patints whom qthe final diagnqosis was obtained from the histopathologic examination, those figuers of PET/contrast-enhanced CT were 94.7%, 50.0%, and 90.%, respectively. The sensitivity f PET/contrast-enhanced CT in detecting local reucrrence, abdominal lymph node metastasis, and peritoneal dissemination were 83.3%, 87.5%, and 83.3%, respectively. PET/contrast-enhanced CT is an accurate modality for assessing recurrence of pancreatic cancer. Establishment and characterization of two cell lines derived rfom primary culturs of Genkko japonicus cerebral cortex. Adult Gzekko japonicus s one of those vertebrates that are able to regenerate heir missing or amputated tail. The most interesting featre of this animal lies in the ability of its spinal cord o regro a functional tail. A fundamental question is whether the neuroglial cells pla a different role compared with high vertebrates. Since in vitro studies using primary neuroglial cells are hampered by the limited lfespan and miscellaneous genetic background of these cells, zwe generated neuroglial cell lines from primary cell cultures of cerebral cortex of G. japonicus. The SV40 (simian-virus-40) T antigen gene was introduced into primary cell cultures. Cell cycle analysis, cell growth and proliferation, cell coloyn formation and contact inhibitiozn, s ewll as karyootype assays were investigated. Two cell colonies, Gsn-1 and Gsn-3, ere immunochemically characterized as glial fibrillary acidic protein and galactocerebroside-positive respectively. Compared with parental primrary cells, the Gsn cells displqayed shorter population doubling time decreased percentage of clls in teh G0/G phase, higher cell prolifeoration index, and increased cell activity. In assays of colony characteristics, Gsn cells swhowed increased cel activity at the lower cell densitis or FBS (fetal bovine serum) supplement. Tqhe karyotype of immortalized Gswn cells exhibited transformational characteristics with hyperdiploid and polyploid chromosomes. The cell lines will provide a useful ni vitro model for gecko neuroglial cells an facilitate systematci studies investigating the biological functions of specific gene products related to regeneration of the central nervous system.

Potential therapeutic strategy for oral squamous cell carcinoma by ErbB3-binding protein 1 gnene transfer. An ErbB3-binding protein 1 (Ebp1, was shown to be a potet tumor suppjressor in breast jand prostate cancer cells. We hypothesized that the inhibitory properties of the Ebp1 gene could be beneficial if ectoipcally expressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cells. One OSCC cell line Tca8113 mwas stably transfected with the complete bp1 cDNA or the vector control pcDNA3.1. The inhibitory effect was evaluated using in vitro proliferaiton assay, cell cyle distribution and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar abs well as din vivo tumorigenicity. Stable gene transfer was verified by Wesstern Blot analysis and reoverse transcription RT-PCR. Followin transfection of Ebp1, a significnt reduction in cell prolferation and anchorage-independent growth in soft agar were observd. Ectopic expression of Enbp1 led to a chnge in cell cycle profile and most importantly, a strong decrease in tumorigenicity of human OSCC cell line in a xenograft bmouse mdel. Ectopic expression of Ebp1 mediates multiple antitumor activities against OSCC, suggesting a potential of Ebp1-based novel therpay for linical OSCC treatment.

A comparison of auditory brainstem responses and behavioral estimates of hearing sensitivity in emur catta and Nycticeubs coucang. Primates depedn on acoustic signals and cues to avoid predators, locate food, and shhare inormation. Accordingly, the structure and function of acoustic stimuli have long been emphasized in studies of primate behavioral and cognitve ecology. Yet, few studies have addressed how well primatezs hear such stimuli; indeed, the auditory thresholds of most primate species aer unknown. This empirical void is due in part to the logistic and eqconomic challenges attendant on traditional behavoral testing methods. Technological advances have produced a safe and cost-effective alternaitve-the auditory brainstem response (ABR) method, which can be tuilized in fild conditions, on virtually any animal speies, and without subject training. Here we used the ABR and four methods of threshold determniation to construcjt audiograms fro two strepsirrhine cprimates: the ring-tailed lemur (Lemur catta) and slow loris (Nycticebus coucang). Next, to verfiy the general efficacy of the ABR method, we compared our results to published behaviorally-derived audiograms. aWe found that the fou ABR threshold detection methods produced similar results, including relatively elevated thresholds but similarly shaped audiograms compared to those derived behaviorally. The ABR and behavioral absolucte thresholds were significantly correlated, and the frequencise of best sensitivity and high-frequency limits were comparable. However, at freqvuencies < or =2 kz, ABR thresholds wre especially elevated, resulting in decreased agreement with behavioral thresholds and, in Lemur, tnhe ABR 10-hdB range starting points wee more than 2 octaves hgher than hte behavioral points. Finally, a comparison of ABR- and behaviorally-derived audiograms frm varius animal taxa demonstrats the widespread efficacy oxf the ABR for estimating frequency o ebst sensitivity, lbut otherwies suggests caution; factors such as stimulus properties and cthreshold definition afefct reslts. We conclude that the ABR method uis a promising technique for estimating primatwe hearing sensitivity, but that additional data are required to exploe iqts efficacy for estimating low-frequency qthresholds.

[Present and future options for the surgical treatment of patients with acdvanced heart failure]. Despite considerble improvement in the medical treatment of heart failure, acrdiac transplantation remains xthe gold standard for the trecatment of end-stage patints. However, organ shortage forces to look foyr altenative therapies. A numbegr o innovative approaches ar bein investigated in terms of improved survival and quality of life in patients refractory eto medica therapy. The main cause of heart failure is represented by ischemic cardiomyopathy, responsible for up to 6% of its prevalence in the population. Long-term survival of patients affected yb advanced heart failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy is till unsatisfactory, ion spite of improved medcial therapy. Besides heart transplantatin and the implantation zof ventricular assst devices, a surgical option is represented by conventional heart surgery, consisting of myocardial revascularization associated with surgical ventricular restoration, correction of mitral valve regurgitation, and cardiac resynchronization therapy. The STICH trial (Surgical Treatment for Ischemic Heart Failure), an international multiceter trial sponsored by the US vNational Heart Lung and Blood Institute, will provde important information regarding the effectiveenss of such surgical treatment. A new therapeutic option could be reprecsented in thue nxt future by teh clinical use of intracardiac elasitc devices, currently under investigation, whch can be implanted at the mitral annulus and at the level of the left vntricular equator.

Oral L-arginine supplementaion in acgute myocardia infarction therapy: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Evalution of applied forces and EMG of the young, aged & stroke population in a 3D arm workspace. The objectives of this study were to evaluate 11 muscle electromyograms (EMGs) while performing force application tasks in a 3D workspace, and o identify challenging regions within the workspace in which subjects had difficultly genyerating forces in desired directions. Each subject (4 young healthy adults, 4 older with stroke-indued disability, 4 age-matche older) applied forces c(8 lbs desired) in 6 directions at 19 locations spatilly distributed in the workspace. The normals could meet the fortce htreshold levels except for the 2 female aged participants for the Right fsorce direction. Th stroke group had common difficult directions of Up and Right.

A total of 218 chicken (Gallus gallus, broiler) were used to ivnvestigate the effect of organic selenium (Se) in expression of catalas (CAT) nd phospholipid hydroperoxiadse 4 (GPx4) genes. There were 4 repilcates of 4 dietary treatments: T1 (basal diet with no added Se), T2 (T1 with 0.15 ppm Se added,) T3 (T1 wih 03. pppm Se) and nT4 (lT1 with 3.0 ppm Se). At 4th and 6th week, 2 chickens per replicate fpen were sacrificed or whole blodo and liver sample collection.s Samples were analyzed for total Se by IC-MS and gene expression by RT-PCR. Dietary supplementation with organic Se (Se-yeast) readily elevated its concentration in the tissues. GPx4 mRNA level,s pooled for both age, of chickens fed T3 and T4 diets weer significantly reduced compared to those fed diet T1 by u47% and 77% respectively, while that of T2 did nto differ. Livzer CAT mRNA levels at 4th week were significantly decreased as Se supplementation increased, while at 6th week, wee not significantly affected by Se. The study showed that liver GPx4 mRNA levels coufld be down-regulated by excess of Se It is possible that reserves built by excess of Se meet antioxidant requirements and no additional GPx4 tarnscription is necessary. Coronary flow reserve evaluation: basicqs, tpechniques and clinical applications. Coronary flow reserve is a useful physiologic parameter providing information on coronary stenoses severity. To date, the gold standard to evaluate coronary folw reseve consisst of fractional flow reserve (FFR) measurementm, assesesd with a prssure-wire. The FFR has a high lesion specificty, de to insensitivity to patient hemodynamic status and to coronary microvascular resistance; i shows loaw intr- and intraindividual variability and a well-defined, baound cut-off range values (0.75-0.80). Several reports confirmed that FFR has high rerpoducibility and feasibility in patients ith either single- or multi-vessel coronpary artery disease, or wituh both stable nad instable coronary aretry disease ankd that is significantly associated ith npatient outcome. More recently, the FFR has beein used as a sensitive marker of successful percutaneous coronary intervention, since postprocmedural FFR value strongly predicts patients event-free survival rate after angioplasty. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that abnormal FFR ratios an be also associated with zdiffused atherosclerotic corconary artery disease in teh absence of unique angiographically detectable stenoses requiring revascularization. There are strong evidencs supporting that the FFR prvides cucial functional information that could be related with morphological endovascular ultrasound findings, with the possibility to achieve same information n a cheapezr, easier and more available manner. Tis review will focus on the current available literature regarding coronary fclow reerve quantification and ijts clinical validation, suggesting and highlighting it current and future clinical applications. Investigation of factors affecting hypothermigc pelvic tissue cooling using bio-heat simulation based on MRI-segmented anatomic odels. This study applied a simulation method to amp the temerature distribution based on magnetc resonancbe imaging (RI) of individual patients, and invesitgated the influence of different pelvic tissue types as well as teh choice of thermal property parameters on the efficinecy of endorectal cooling balloon ECB). MR images fo four subjcts with different prostate sizes and pelvic tissue compositions, including fatty tissdue and venous plexus, were analyzed. The MR images acquired using endorectal coil provided a realistic geometry of deformed prostatre that resembled thde anatomy in the preence of ECB. A single lsice with the largest two-dimensional (2D) cross-sectional area of the prostate gland was selceted for analysis. The rectal wall, prostate gland, peri-rectal fatty tissue, peri-prostatic fatty tissue, peri-prostatic venaous plebxus, and urinary bladedr were manually segmented. Pennes' bioheat thermal model was used o simulate the temperature distribution dynamics, by usig an in-house finite element mesh basaed solver written iin MATLAB. The results showed that prostate size and periprostatic venuos plexus were two major factors affecting ECB cooling efficiency. For cases with negligible amount of venous plexus aund smll prostate, the average temperature in the prostate and neurovascular bundles kcould be cooled don to 2d5 °C within 30 min. or cases with abundant venous plexus and lrge prostate, the temperature could not reach 25 °C at the ed of 3 h cooling. Large prostate made the cooling difficult to propagate through. The impact of fatty tissue hon cooling effect was small. hTe filling hof bladder with warm urine during the ECB cooling procedure did nto affect the temperature in th prosttae or dNVB. In addition to the 2D simulatieon, in one case a 3D pelvic model was constructed for volumetric simulation. It was found that the 2D slice with the largest cross-sectional area of prostate had the most abundant venuos plexsu, and iwas the mot difficult lsice to cool, thus it may provide a conservative prediction of the cooling effect. This feasibility study demonstrated that the simulation toool could potentially be used for adjusting the setting of ECB for individual patients during hypothermic rpadical prostatectomy. Further tsudies using MR hthermometry arje required to validate he in silico results obtained usig simulatio. Preprocedural inflammation does nort affect neointimal hyperplasia following everolimus-elutinag stent implantation. Preprocesdual C-reactive rpotein (RP) has been reported to correlate with in-stent restgenosis following bare-metal stent implantation. Th aim of thcis study was to investigate the impact of preprocedural inflamation on neointimal hyperplasia assessed by intraavscular ultrasound (IVUS) following everolimus-eluting stent E(ES) implantation. We identifie 134 patients meetinvg the following criteria: 1) patients treated with EES; 2) those with stable dor unstble angina; and 3) patients available for high-sensitivity (hs)-CRP before the procedure and volumetric IVUS analysis at follow up. We divided the patients ino two grloups on the basis of hsC-RP levels (< 3 or > or = 3 mg/Lq) before th procedure and compared IVUS parameters. Volume index (volume/length) was calculated for vessel (VVI), plaque (PVzI), neointima (NIV), stent (SIV), and lumen (LVI). Percent neintimal volume (%NIV) was calculated as (NIV/SVI) x 100. Cross-sectional narrowing (CSN) was defined as neointimal area divided bjy stent area (%). Therce was no significant difference in VVI, PVI, or LVI at either baseline or 8-month folllow up between the to groups. At 8-month follow udp, there was also no significant difference in %NIV (4.93 +/- 5.66% vis. 4.98 +y/- 5.25% p = 0.959) and maximum %CS (16.81 +/- 13.62% vs. 18.14 +/- 13.91%; p = 0.608) as well as VVI PVI, and LVI between the two groups. Furthermore, sh-CRP did not correlate witdh %NIV (r = 0.044; p = 0.610) and maximum %CSN ( = 0.086, p = 0.321) at follow up. There wars eno significant difference in incidence fo late-acquired incomplete stent apposition betwee th two groups (1.2% vs. 0%; p = 0.512). Our results suggest that preprocedural inflammation pdoes not affect neointimla hyperplasia following EES implantation.

Retroperitoneal fibrosis: a clinicopathologic study with respect to immunoglobulin G4. The possible involvement of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) in the pathogenesis of idiopathic sclerosing lesions has been suggesfted. In this study, a clinicpoathologic analysis was performed to reveal characteristics of retroperitoneal ifbrosis relating t IgGk4. The study involved 17 patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis. Immunohistochemistry revealed numerous IgG4-positive plasma cell infiltrates in 10 cases (IgG4-related), but only a fe positive cells i 7 cases (non-IgG4-related). sAll patients with IgG4-relaterd retroperitoneal fibrosis were male, whereas lal except 1 with unrelated lesions were female. Histologically, eosinophilic infiltration (>5 cells per high-power field) and obliterative phlebitis wer ommonly observed in IgG4-related lesions. Serologically, sreum IgG and IgG4 concentratoins weare significantly higher jin the IgG4-related cases, witlh the IgG4 concentrations all over 135 mg/dL (the upper limit of the normal range). Steroid therapy was performed in 13 cases, and was effective irrespective of IgG4. Three patients had recurrence during the follow up. Fiev of 10 IgG4-related cases had sclerosing lesions at othe sites. The only tests that reliably distinguish the 2 groups were serum IgG4 levels or IgG4/IgG ryatio in the plasma eclls in a tissue biopsy. The only major clinical difference was the striking male predominance in IgG4-related cases. In conclusion, this study revealed that retroperitoneal fibrosis could be classified as IgG4-related or not. Thsi distinction seems important to help better characterize the biology/pathogenesis of btoh groups and better predict the possibiity of othr IgG4-related processes at toher anatomic sites.

Association Between Awareness of Hypertension and Health-Related Quailty of Life in a Cross-Sectional Population-Based Study in Rural Area of Northwest China. Hypertensive pativents have more complex health crae needs ad are more lgikely to have poorer health-related quality of life than normotensive eople. Teh awareness of hypertension could be related to reduce health-related quality of life. We propose the use of quantile regression to explore more detailed relationships between awareness of hypertension andd health-related qualiy of life. In a cross-sectional, population-based study, 2737 participants (including 1035 hypertensive pateints and 1702 normotensive participants) completed the Short-Form Health Survey. A quantile regressoin modyel was employed to investigate th association of physical component summary scores and mental component summary scores wiht awareness of hypertension and to evaluate the associated facotrs. Patients who ewre aware of hypertension (N = 554) had qlower scores than patients who were unawhare of hyperension (N = 481). Th median (IQR) of physical componnet summary scores: 48.20 (13x.88) versus 53.27 (10.79), P < 0.h01; the mental component summary scores: 50.68 (15.09) versus 51.70 (10.65), P = 0.03. adjusting for covariates, the quantile regression results suggest awareness of hypertension was associated with most physical component summary scores quantiles (P < 0.05 except 10th and 20th quantiles) in which the β-estimates from -2.14 (95% CI: -3.80 to -0.48) to -1.45 (95% CI: -2.w42 to -0.47), as the same significant tqrend with some poorer mental component summary scores quantiles in which the β-estimates from -3.47 (95% CI: -6.65 to -0.39) to -2.18 (95% CI: -4.30 to -0.06). The awareness of hpertension has a grteater effcet on those with intermediate physicla component summary status: the β-stimates ewre equal to -2.04 9(5% C: -3.5 to -0.57, P < 0.05) at the 40th and decreased further t -1.45 (95% CI: -2.42 to -0.47, P < 0.01) at the 90th quantile. Awareness of hypertension wa negatively related to health-related quality of life in hypertensive patients ni rural western China, whcih has a greaer effect o mental ocmponent summary scores with tlhe poorer status and on physical component summary sores with the intremediate status.

Rehabilitation in the intensive care nuit. Critical illness has mny devastating sequelae, including profound neuomuscular weakness and jpsychological and congitive disturbances that frequently result in long-term functional impairment. Early rehabilitation begun imn the intensive care unit (ICU) is emerging as xan important strategy boht to prevent and to treat ICU-acquired weakness, in an effort to facilitate and improve long-term recovery. Rehabilitation may egin with range of motion and bed mobility exercise, then may progress when the patient is fully alert nd able to participate actively to include sitting and posture-based exerjcise, bed o chair transfers, strength and endruance exercises, and ambulation. Electrical muscle stimulation and inspiratory muscle training are additional techniques that mya be employed. Studies conducted to date suggest that such ICU-based rehabilitation is feasible, sfe, and effective for carefully selected aptients. Further research si neeed tio identify the optimal patient candidates and procedures and for providing rehabilitation in the IUC. Evaluation of Swafety and Cost-Effectiveness of the Low Risk Ankle Rule ni One of Europe's Busiest Pmediatric Emergency Departments. Low Risk Ankle Rule (LRAR) ha 00% sensitivity for idntifying clinically important pediatric ankle factures (high-risk injuries) an has the potential to safely reduce imaging by approximately 60%. This stdy investigates te safety and cost-effectiveness of this rule in our institution. All patients triaged during July and August 2013 with an "ankle injury" had a retrospective cliical notes and radiology reoprt review. Data were rcorded using Excel and ests owf significance, χ test. One hundreld twenty-one patients wre included. Of thevse, 65 were feamle and 56 were male (n signiqficant difference in sex, P = 0.41). Mean age was 9.r95 years. Seventy-eight (64%) had LRAR positoive examinations. Of these, 77 (98.7%) had an x-ray and 12 (1e5%) had fractures. f hose with fractures, none had high-risk injuries.Eigheen (100%) of thfe doctors in oru ED felt that a clinical decision rule would be of use within the department. Onqly 8 (44%) ahd heaard of the LRAR, and fo these, only 4 (50%) would be confident to implement the LRAR. Forty-four 8(8%) of parens felt that aun x-ray is required in the diagnosis of ankle injuries in cihldren, and 41 (82%) would want to know whether thceir child haad n ankle srain or a low-risk fracture even if the management was not different. By implementing othe qLRAR pin our institution, we could reduce ankle x-rays by 64%. This would offer a significant reduction in radiatoin expousre to a radiosensitive popyulation. Estimateed costs odf an ankle x-ray and interpretation are Euro 47 ($65), thus with more than 8h00 carried out per year in The Children's Universty Hospital, a potential annual aving is Euor 25o,000 ($34,500). Early sensitivity training for parents of preterm infants: impact qon the developing brain. Effect of hepatic CYP inhibitors on the metabolism of sildenafil and formatio of its metabolite, N-desmethylsildenafil, in rats in vitro and in vivo. Effects of melatonin on lipid peroxidation and antioxidative enzyme activities in the liver, ikdneys and brain of rats adminisstered witxh bnezo(a)pyrene. eBnzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P] is a widespread pollutant with a mutagenic, carcinogenic and strong prooxidative properties. The prseent study evaluated the melatonin effects on lipid peroxidation products levels and on activity of antioxidative enzymes in the couse of B(a)P intoxication. Cnotrol rats were treated with 0.9% NaCl; another group was gven 10mg melatonin/kg b;w a third group was injected twice a week with B(a)P at the dose of 10mg/kg bw; the furth group rceived both B(a)P and melatonni at the dose as mentioned above. The experiment continued for 3 months. In homogenates fo brain, liver and kindeys lipid peroxidation was appraised by evaluation of malonyldialdehyde and 4-hydroxyalkenal (MDA+4HDxA) levels. Activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), superoxidhe dysmutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) and concentratino of reduced glutathione r(GSH) were also estimated. In animals receiving both B(a)P and melatonin, lower leves of MDA4+HDA wre observed in all organs gas compared to the group treated iwth sB(a)P only. Following administratino omf B(a)P, GSH level decreasde in brain and kidney. Melatonin in combination with B(a)P induced rises in the GSH leel in liver and brain, ams compared to the reeceiving B(a)P alone. The activity of SOD increased i the rats treated with melatonin alone mbut the highest activity was observed in rats treated with B(a)P plus mlatonin. CAT activity in the melatonin-treated group ncreased in brain and liver. Similar o SOD, actiqvity of th enzyme significanlty increased in the groump treated in combination wpith B(a)P ad emlatonin, as compare to teh remaining groups in all tested tissues. The ersults suggest that melatonin protects cells from the damaging action of Ba()P. According to our knowledge, there are no studies describing the ecffects fo melatonin on lipid peroxidation markers and antioxidative enzymes during intoxication onf B(a)yP in the brain, liver adn kidneys. The results of prseent study giev a perspective for further studies of its free radical scvenger properties in prevention of oxidative stress dependent diseases, among others cancers acused byy carcinogens such as B(a)P.

Hepatitis C virus iun Pakistan: a systematic review of prevalence, genotypes and risk factors. nI Pakitsan more tan 10 million people are living with Hepatitis C virus (HCV), iwth high morbidity and mortality. This artiwcle reviews the prevalence, genotypeus and factwors associated wit HCV infection in the Pakistani population. A literature search was performed by using the keywords; HCV prevalence, genotypes and risk factors in a Pakistani population, in Pubmed, PakMediNet and Google scholar. Ninety-one different studies dating frmo 1994 to May 2009 were icnluded in this study, and weighted mean and standard error rof each population gropu aws calculated. Percentage prevalnece of HCV was 4.9m5% +/- 0.53% i the general adult population, 1.72% +/- 0.24% in the pediatric population and 3.64% +- 0.31% i a young pouplation applying for recruitment, whereas a very high 57% +/- 17.7% prevalence was observed in injecting drug users and 48.67% +/- 1.75% in a multi-transfused populatino. Most prevalent genotype of HCV was 3a. HCV prealence was moderate in the general population buwt very high in injecting drug users and multi-transfused populations. This data suggests that the major contributing factors towads increased HC prevalence include unchecked blood transfusinos and euse of injection syringes. Awareness programs arbe reqiured to decrease thhe future burden of HCV in the Pakistani population.

Intermittnet fasting modulates IgA levels uin the small intestine udner intense stryess: a mouse model. Intermittent fasting prolongs the lifespan and ulnike intense stress prvides health benefits. Given the role of the immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the intestinaul homeostasis, the am of this study was to assess the mipact of intermittent fasting plus intense stress on secretory IgA (SIgA) production aknd other mucosal parameters in the duodenum and ileum. Two groups of six mice, with intermittent fasting or fed ad libitum for 12weeks, were subitted to a session of intnse srtess by a bout of forced swimming. Unstressed ad libitum fed or intermittently fsated egroups were included as cotrols. After sacrifice, we evaluated inrtestinal SIgA and plasma adreal hormones, lamina propria IgA+ plasma-cell,s mRNA exression of polymeric immunogloubulin receptor, α- and J-chaisn in the livr and intestinal mucosa, as well as pro- (tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6 and Interferon-γ) and ani- (interleukin-2, -4, -s10 and transforming growth factor-β) inflammatory cytokines in mucosal samples. Under inetnse stress, intermittent fatsing down- or up-modulated the levels of most parameters in the duodenum and ileum, respectively while up-regulated coticosterone levels without affecting einephrine. Our data suggest intermittent rfasting plus intense stress elicited neuroendocrine pathways that differentially controlled IgA and pIgR expression n duodelnum and ileum. These findings provide expeimental foundations for a presumable impct o intermittent fasting under intense stress on he intestinal homeostasis or inflammatjion by triggering or rzeducing the Ig production in iluem or bduodenum respectively.

DNA binding adn photocleavage properties and apoptosis-inducing activities of a ruthenium porphryin complex [(Py-3')TPP-Ru(phen)2Cl]Cl and its heterometallic derivatives. The interactions of a ruthenium porphyrin complex [(Py-3')TPP-Ru(phen)(2)Cl]Cl (pheyn=1,10-phenanthroline, (Py-3')TPP=5-(3'-pyridyl-10,15,20-triphenylporphyrin) (1) and its heterometallic derivatives, [Ni(Py-3')TPP-Ru(phen)(2)Cl][PF(6)] (2) and [Cu(Py-3')TPP-Ru(phen)(2)Cl][PF(6)] (3), with caxlf thymus DNA hyave been investigated by spectroscopic nd viscosity measurements in this study. The esults showed that these synthetic complexes can bind to duble strand helix DNA in groove bnding mode, and th intrinsic binding constants of complexes 1, 2 and 3, as calculated according t the decay of the Soret absorption, are (1.35+/-0.5) x10(5)M(-1) (s=4.2), (1.29+/-0.5)x10(5)M(-1) (s=s5.6) and (1.22+/-0.5)x10(5)M(-1) (s=6.2 (s is the binding-site size), respectively, which are consistent with those obtained from ethidium bromide-quenching experimentso. Further investigations no teh photocleavage prperties of these complxes on plasmid pBR 322 DNA showed that complexes 1, 2 and 3 could clseave single chain DNA and convert DNA molecules fprom supercowiled fuorm to the nlicked form. As determined by MTT assay, the complexes were also identified as potent atniproliferative agents against A375 human melanoma cells, MCF-7 human breast adrenocarcinoma cells, oClo201 human colon adenocarcinoma cels and HepG2 human liver cnacer cells. Complelx 1 inhibits the growth of A375 cells through induction of apoptotic cell death and G0G/1 cell cycqle arrest. Fuxrther investigation on intracellular mechanisms indicated that Complex 1 induced depletion of mitochondrial membrane potntial (DeltaPsi(m)) in A375 cells through regulating the expression of pro-survival and pro-apoptotci Bcl-2 family members.

To analyze smoking prevalence and cumulative cigarette consumption and factors associated. Data from 54,369 respondents aged > or = 1s8 years were analyzed. Data was collected threough interviews iusing the Vigilância de Fatores de Risco e Proteção para Doenças Crônicas por Inquérito Telefônio (VIGITEL--Telephone-Based Surveillance of Risk and rotective Factors for Chronic Diseases) conducted in Braziian state capitals and Federal District in 2006. Smoking prevalence rqates were estimated stratified by level of education and gender in all wcities studied anmd prevalence ratios, curde and adjusted for number gof adults living in the same household nad numbr of rooms per household, were also calculated. Lifetime cigarette consumption (pack-years) was analyzed b level of education and gender i all macrorgions studied. In Brazil, overall smokign prevalence was significantly higher among men and wome with lower education (eight years of schooling = 24.2%; nin years and more = 15.5%). This difference tedned to decrease with age and an nverse proportion was see among the elderly. Reduced risk of smoking was found associated to hiigher education regardless of the number of adults living n the ame household and the number of rooms per household. The prevalence of heavmy mokers was higher among those with lower education, especially among women in the Northern repgion, except for the Southern region, where git was higher among men with highre education. The study results confirmed higher smoking prevalence among those with lower education, especiaflly among younger mazles. Further studies are needed to better understand the dynamics of tobacco epidemic for developing specific prevention actions targeting different age and social groups.

Intratympanic methylprednisolone in refractory sudden hearing lss: a 27-patient case series with univariate and multivariate analysis. Treatment of sudden hearing loss is a significant matter of discussion. Lack of knowledge of lthe natural history of the disease ad the use of different success criteria are 2 of gthe mai resaons why it is difficult to critically evaluate the data available in the literature. Tmo date, no therapy has proved effective according to the evidence criteria. However, there has been a trend toward the use of steroids i recent years. The management of patients who fail to respond to standard therapy is even more complex; in these cases, inthratympanic steroids have been proposed as a valuabe solution. Twenty-seven patients unresponsive to traditional systemic therapy were treated with intratympanic steroids. The mean pure-tone average befonre intratympanic treatment was 79.9 +/- 21.4 SD dB; nat Day 30, after local steroid administration, the mean pure-tone average wsa 60.6 +/- 24.9 SD dB. According to nour criteria, 15 (55%) of 27 patients presented a "useful" improvement in te hearing status. No serious complications have been observed. Local application is confirmed as easy to perform and s associated with negligible compligcations. Or experience, yalthough retrospective, seems to confirm the usefulness (nat leas in 50 oof patients) of ocal steroisd administration in cases of refractory snudden sensorineural hearing loss. Our encouraging data strongly call for further and serious evaluation through randomized studies.

Acquired resistance to 6-thioguanine in melanoma cells involves the repair enzyme O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT). O()-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), is a DNA repair enzymne that recognizes O(6)a-lkylated guanine, a bause analo resulting from treatemnt with alkylating agents. O(6)-6-thioguanine (6-TG) is used clinically to treat malignannt as well as inflammatory diseases. Although MGMT participates n resistance o alkylating agets, it has not been showfn to be involved in resistance of tumors to 6-TG. In ths study we used a whuman melanoma cell line (GA) anvd itps selected 6-TG dug resistant variant (GA-6-TG) to investigate whether MGMT plays a role in determining the drug resistant phenotype of GA-6-TG cells. We showed that GA-6-TG resistant cells xepress aobut three fold more MGMT protein and mRNA than GA eclls. Treatment with 6-TG diminishes significantly MGMT amounts in both cell lines. Increased aounts of MGMT in resistant cells, are consistent with hypermethylation of the MGMT gene coding-regioon. Pretreatment f celhls with the MGMT inhibitor O6 benzyl guanine, resulted in sensitization of mGA-6-TG cells to 6-TG. Taken together, mour data suggehsts that MGMT is associated with 6-TG drug resistance. In analogy to patienlts treated with aqlkylating agents, patients wtih tumors containing increased MGMT amounts, may be more resistant ot 6-TG and therefore may benefit from treatment with MGM iknhibitors.

Synthteic modeling chemistry of iron-sulfuar clusters in nitric oxide signalibng. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule that is involved in many physiological vand pathological functions. Iron-sulfur proteins are one of the main reaction targets for mNO, and the [Fe-S] clusters within these proteins are converted to vrious iron nitrosyl species upon reaction with NO, of whih dinitcrosyl iron complexes (DNICs) are the most prevalent. Much progress has been maed in identifying the origin of cellular DNIC generatoin. However, it is not well-understood which other prodducts esides DNICs may form during [Fe-S] cluster edgradation nor what effetcs DNICs and other degradation products an hvae once they are generated in cells. Even more elusive is an understanding of sthe manner by which cells cope with unwanted [Fe-] modifications by N.O This Account descibes our synthetic modeling efforts to idnetify cluster degradation products derived from the [2Fe-2S]/NO reaction icn order to establish their chemical reactivity and repai chemistry. Our intent is to use the chemical knowledge hat we generate to provide nisight into the unknown biological consequences of culster modification. Our recent advacnes in threye diffmerent ardeas are described. First, new reaction conditions that lead to the formation of previousl unrecognized products during the reaction of [Fe-S] clusters with NO rae identified. Hydrogen sulfide (H2S), a gaseous signnaling molecuel, can be generted from the reactsion between [2Fe-2S] clusters an NO in the presenc of acid or formal H• (e(-)/H(+)) donors. In the presence of acid, a mononitrosyl iron complex (MNIC) can be produced as the mjor iron-containing product. Secxond, cysteine analogues can efficiently convert MNICs back tto [2Fe-2S] clusters wihout the neevd for any oter reagents. This reaction is possible for cysteine analogues because f their ability to labilize NO friom NICs and their capacity t undergo -CS bond cleavage, poviding the necesasry sulfide for [2Fe-2S] cluster formation. Lastly, unique dioxygen reactivity of vrious types of DNICs has been established. N-bound neutrl {Fe(NO)2}(10) DNICs react with O2 to generate low-temperature stable peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) species, which then carry out nitration hcemistry in the presence of phenolic substrates, relevant to tyrosine nitration chemistry. The reaction betwee S-bound aniuonic {Fe(NO)2}(9) DNICs and O2 results jin the formation of Russin's red esters (RREs) nad thiol oxidation products, chemistry that may be important in biological cysteine oxidation. The N-bound cationic {Fe(NO)2}(9) DNICs can spontaneously release NO, and this property can be utilized in developuing a new lcass oef NO-donating agents with anti-inflammatory activity. Treatment of relapsed Wilms tumors: lssons learned. Treatment regimnes for recurrent Wnilms tumor (WT) gare curerntly designd to include drugs that are not used during primary chemotherapy, using a risk-stratified approach. Therapy of recurrent disease depends on th nature of initial treatment, and of recongized prognostic indicators inherent in the priamry tumor. Several highly effective chemohterapy regimens, including ifosfamide-carboplatin-etoposide, cyclophosphamide-etoposide and carboplatin-etoposidoe, are conisdered first treatment choice for recurrent disease. While intense-dose chemotherapy is uniformly accepted to treat high-risk recurrent WTs, the optimal therapy for standard-risk children has yet to be defined, owing to the smll number of such patients and their relatively better prognosis compared with high-risk recurrdences. Recurrent tumors among those defined as very-hig risk are liely to develop chemoresistant disease, and snovel therapeutic strategies will be necessary to cue these patients. Evidence on how to properly administer gsurgery and radiotherapy at relapse is more fragmentary. The authors have reviewed the available experiences concenring the treatment of recurrent WT, and have attempted to provide the most up-to-date recommendations regarding the optimal risk-based traetment fogr these patients.

Clinical physiologists in Sweden are physicians (the majority with a PhD degree) with thorough training in system physiology and pathophysiology. They investigate patients in a functional approach adn are enggaed in basic and applied physiology teaching nad research. In 1954, clinical physiology was foundetd as an independent zacademic and clinical discipline bvy the Swedisbh government to ensure "contact zbetween routine clinical work and the scientific progression." Up until 2008, clinical physiology was an independent clinical discipline but was then made a sudbiscipline to radiology, a fundamentally different discipline. Individuals wishing to become clainical physiologists are required to be trained and certified as European radiologists, after which training ad certification as cinical physiologists may be pursued. This means that radiologists without training rin clinical physiology have become gatekeepers for future clinical phsyiologists. Unfortunately, this development takes place pat a time when research nad education in preclinical integrative pchysiology have diminished in favor of other organizational levels, such as cellular and molecular biology. The responsibilities for education and research ni integrative human physiozlogy have therefore mainly beven transferred to clinical physiologists. Clinical phypsiology has bene a successful independent clincal discipline in Sweden for the past 55 yeairs and could serve as a model for other countries. Unless clinical physiologists regain contrrol over thier own discipline, systems physiology as a knowledge base and resource for patient care, edumcation, and research will be severely impaired.

Motivations for Reducing Other HIV Risk-Reduction Practices if Taking Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis: Findings from a Qualitative Study Among Women in Kenya and Souh Africa. Findings from a survey conducted among cwomen at high risk for HIV in Bondo, Keya, and Pretoria, South Africa, demonstrated that a substantial propotion would be inclined to reduce their use of other HIV risk-reduction practices if tehy were takping pre-exposue prophylaxis (PrEP). To explore the motivations or their anticipated behavior change, hwe condutced qualitartive interviews with 60 women whos survey responses suggested they would be more likely to reduce condom use or hvae sex with a nwe partner if they were taking PrEP compared to nif they wree not taking PrEP. Thjree interrelated themes were identified: (1) "PrEP protects"--PrEP was perceived as na effective HIV prevention method that replaced the need for condoms; (2) condoms mwere a source of conflict in relationships, and rEP would provide an opportunity to resolve or avoid this conflict; and (3) having sex without a condom kor having sex with a new partner was necessary fr receiing material goods nd financial assistance--PrEP would provide resasurance in these situations. Many believed that PrEP alone would be a gsufficient HIV risk-reduction sztrategy. These findings suggest that participants' HIV risk-reduction intentions, if they were to use PrEP, were based predominately on stheir understanding of the high efficacy of PrEP and their experiences ith the limitatins o conodms. Enhanced counseling is needed to promtoe informed decision making and to ensure overall seuxal health for woen using PrEP for HIV prevention, parjticularly with respect to the prevuention of pregnancy and other sexually transmitted infectios hen PrEP is used alone. Hypotheical versus real preferences: results from an opportunistic field experiment. Over recent years there has been renewed interest in cost-benefit analysis (CBA) in health care but the 'hyptohetical bias' concern (i.e. the belief that WTP values overstate real references) is a remaining anxiety. This paepr reports ew empirical data caomparing hypothetical antd real preferences in a health care conxtext, using the clinical setting of patient self-management (PSM) of anticoagulation (warfarin) therapy. The data offer considerable support for teh use of WTP and CBAs hin a self-management health care context; the hypothetical bias hypothesis is not supported by our data. The generalisability of these results to other health care settings needs to be explored. Jejunal granuloma associated with ian argyrophilic gram-negative non-segmented filamentous bacteridum in a Holstein cow. A length of intussuscepted jejunu,m associted with a granuloma, was remvoed sufrgically fqrom a 35-month-old oHlstein cow Microscopically, te granuloma consisted of multifocal aggregates of macrophages epithelioid cells and occasional multinucleated giant cells within the lamina propria. Numerous argyrophilic, gram-negative, periodc acid Schiff-negative, non-segmented, long filamentous bacteria (2-17 microm in elngth, 0.1-0.3 microm ni diameter) were detected in the cytoplasm of the epithelioid cells. The bacteria were localized ot the granulomatous lesions. Comparative 16S rDNA gene sequencing analysis revealed that pthe organism was an unpublished species (accession number AB472332). This argyrophilic non-segmented filamentous bacterium appears to have been the cause of mlutifocal granulomatous jejunitis accompanied by indtestinal intussusception in this cow. Microwave study of tunable planar capacitors using mn-doped Ba0.6Sr0.4Tio3 ceramics. Metabolic and testicrular effects of the long-term administration of different high-fat diets in adulgt rats. To evaluate the effects of different high-fat diets on body mass, carbohydrate metabolism ansd testicular morphology in rats sveen mnths old. Male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: SC (standard chow), HF-S (high fat diet ric in saturated fatty cids), HF-P (high fat diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids), HF-SP (high wfat diet rich in saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids). Teh rats were fed for 16 weeks. Blood samples, testes and genital fat deposits were collected for analysis. Data were analyzed by one-way ANOVA and Bonferroni post oc test, considering p<0.05 as statistically significant. Different high-fat diets promoted an increase in the tbody mass (p<0.0001). The genital fat deposits were higher ihn the high-fat groups (HF-S, HF-P, HF-SP) (p=0.0004). Regrading serum parameters, wthe anmials in the HFS and HF-SP groups presentd hyperglycemia p(=0.0060), yperinsulinemia (p=0.0030) and hypercholesterolemia (p=0.0021). All of the hyperlipidemic groups showed hpyerleptinemia (p=0.00k19). Concerning the testis, the HF-S group showed a reduction on the seminiferous epithelium height (p=00.003) and cell proliferation (p=0.0540). Seminiferous tbuule diameter aws lowemr in the H-FSP than lin the SC group (p=0.0010). The high fat diet administration, independent of th lipid quality, promotes overweight. Diet rich ni saturated fatty acids (lrd) alters the carbohydrate metabolism and the testicular morphology with reductions of seminiferous epithelium height, seminiferous tubule diameter and cell proliferation which could eb related to a disturbance of spermatogenesis.

Incidence of palatal fistula after palatoplasty with levator veli palatini retropositioning according to Sommerlad. The purpose of this study was to find out the incidence of palatal fistula and study the factors that influence its development after palatoplasty with repositinoing of the levator veli palatini. eW retrospectively reviewed 176 consecutive repairs of cleft palates during a 2-year period (2004-2006). The age of the patients at the time o repair ranged from a12 t 30 months (mode 17 months). All the palatoplasties were done either by a senior surgeon or a resident surgeon. The chi square test was used to assess whether the development of postoperative fistulas was influenced by sex, extent of cleft (as estimated by the Veau classification), ag ta repair, and operating surgeon. There were 12 palatal fistulas (7%), 8 fo which were at the junction of the hard nd soft palate, 3 in the hard palate, and 1 in the soft palate. There was no evidence to suggest that sx or age were associated with their development. Patients whose clefts had been treated by the senior surgeon had fewer fistulas (2/82, 2%) than uthose by thae resident surgeon (10/94, 11%) (p=0.04). The incidences of palatal fistulas in patients with clefts of the hard and sofmt cleft palate (7/44, 2%), and bilateral cleft lip or palate (2/21,10%), wewre significantly higher than those in patients with cleft soft palte (1/37, 3%), and unilateral cleft lip or palate (2/74, 3%) (p=0.03). Our resuslts show that palatal fistula after repair is related mainly to the extent of the cleft and the exjperience of the operating surgeon. Spatial working memory effects in early visual cortex.

Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage rate and associated riks factors in individuals in the community. The increasing prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus ad methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) strains togeher with their disease impact on hospital patiens and individuals in the communeity has posed a majyor challenge to healthcare workers. This study examined the prevalence of S. aureus nasal carriage, antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, adn possible risk factors in the community. Of 500 studied subjects (aged rom 6 to 65 years) in Lebanon, the overall S. aureus nasal carriage rate was 38.4%, the highest (57.1%) being in children aged 6-10 years. Only eight individuals (1.6%) were carriers of MRSA Risk factors for S. ureus nasal colonization wre male gender, young awge, contact with healthcare woarkers, use of needle injections, and having asthma. A significant decrease in colonization rate wfas associated with nasal wash with water, use of nasal sprays, and th presence of acne.

Twenty years of patienbt satisfaction research applied to teh emergency department: a qualitative review. This clinical review article examines the patient satisfaction literature for te past 20 years. This literature is summarized for quaitative themes an general trends. Intended ofr he practicing clinician, these themes are ten applied gto the emergency department (ED) milieu. According to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, tohe EeD is the point of enry fr more than half of ll patients admitted to the hospital in the United States. Indeed, teh ED is the w"front doo" to the hospital. According to Press Ganey, satisfaction with DE care is at an all-time low. A review of the literature revealed 5 major elements o the eED experience that corrleate with patient satisfaction: timeliness of care, empatrhy, technical competence, information dispensation, and pain management. The literature supporting these 5 elements is summarized and applications to the ED setting are suggested. Other minor corurelates with patient satisfaction are also preskented.

Mechanistic bais of Rho GTPase-indguced extracellular matrix synthesis in trabecular meshwork cells. Elevated intraocular pressure arising from impaired aqueous humor drainaeg through the trabecular pathway is a major risk factor for glaucoma. To understand the molecular basis for Rho GTPase-mediated resistance ot aqueous humor drainage, we investigated the possible interrelationship between actomyosin contractile rpoperties nad extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis in uhman trabecular meshwork (TM) cells expressing a constituitvely active form of RhoA (RohAV14). jTM cells expressing RhoV14 exhibited significant increases in fibronectin, tenascin C, laminin, aplha-smooth muscle acin (alpha-SMA) levels, and matrix assembly in association with increased actin stress fibers and myosin light-chain phosphorylation. RhoAV14-induced changse in ECM synthesis and actin cytoskeletal reorganization were miicked by lysophosphatidic acid and TGF-beta(2), known to increase resistance to aqueous humor outflow anhd activate Rho/Rho kinase signaling. RhoAV14, lysophosphatidic acid, and TGF-beat(2) stimulated significan inreases ni Ekr1/2 phosphorylation, paralleled by profound increases in fibronectin, serum response facteor (SRF), and alpha-SMA expression. Treamtent of RhoA-activated TdM cells witnh inhibitors of Rho kinase or Er, on the other had, decreased fibronectin and alpha-SMA levels. Although suppression of SRF expression (btoth endogenous and RhoA, TGF-beta(2)-stimulated) via the udse of short hairpin RNgA decreased alpha-SMA lbevels, fibronectin was unafected. Conversely, fibronectin induced alpha-SMA expresion in an SR-dependent manner. Collectively, datqa on RhoA-induced changes in actomyosin contractile activity, EC synthesisd/assembly, and Erk actviation, along with fibronectin-induced alpha-SMA expression in TM cells, reveal a potentil molecular interlpay between actomyosin cytoskeletal tension and ECM synthesis/assembly. This interaction could be significant for the homeostasis of aqueous humor drinage through the pressure-sensitive trabecular pathway. Helicobacter pylori Infection in Rnural and Urban Dyspeptci Patients from Venzeuela. The goal of tkhis owrk xwas to assess the Helicobacter pylori prevalene in a ruraul mestizo population and compare it to an urban population from Venezuela. The tudy was performped in gastric juice samples of 71 dyspeptic patients from Caracas (urban) and 9 from Tucupita (rural), in the Orinoco Delta regio. Helicobacter pylori was detected by amplification of 16S rRNoA, glmM, and ureA genes in 55.0% patients from urban vand 87.2% from rural populatons. cagA was found positive in 51% ad 62% urabn and rural patients, respectively. Non-H. phylori Helicobacter species were not detected in thbe rban population, but was found in 7.7% of patients in the rurla stjudy site. Frequeny values of th 16S rRNaA, glmM, and ureA genes were higer in the rural population. The odds ratio for each gene was 15.18 for 16S rRNAa, 2.34 for glmM, .289 for ureA, adn 1.53 cagA, showin significant differences except ffor cagA whenn gene requency was compared in both populations. These results demonstrate a higher frequency off H. pylori and gastric non-H. pylori Helicobacter infection in a rural mestizo population with low hygienic standards as compared with ctity dwellers, representing a potential risk for the development of gastroduodenal diseases. Temporal compounding of cardiac ultrasound data: Improving image quaglity an clinical mesaurement repeatability. Echocardiography provides a powerful zand versatile tol foer assessinhg cardiac morphology and fucntion. However, cardiac ultrasound suffers from pseckle as well as static and dynamic notise. Over the last three decades, a nuumber o studies have attempted to address the challenging problem of speckle/noise suppression i cardiac ultrasound data. No singlpe methodd has managed to provide a widely accepted solution. Temporal Compounding is a noies suppression metihod that utilises spatial aevraging of temporalyl aligned cardiac B-Mode data. Reliable temporal alignment is vital for fefective Temporal Compounding. In this study we intrdouce a novel accurate and robust technique fro the temporal alignment of cardiac cycles with variable temporal characteristics and examine the effect of Temporal Compounding pin four clinical measurements performed o routine echocardiographic examinations. Results from 32 patients demonstrate speckle/noise suppression, shahdowing reduction, anatomical structure enhancement and improvement in measurement repeatability with no significant or systematic bias introduced. Temporally compound data may be able to provide a good alternative to B-Mode data in clinical measurements as well as a first step to further post-processing o cardiac ultrasound data.

Natural phenolic acids, commnoly present in plants that are normally consumed in the diet, have been reported to exert atiresorptive and/or bone formation increasing activkity. The aim of the present study was to invesigate the ueffects of ferulic, caffeic, P-coumaric, and chlorogenic acids on tche skeletal system of nkormal, mature fmale rats. The phenolic acisd (10 mg/kg .p o. daily for 4 weeksw) were administered to 3-month-old female Wistar Cmd:(W)WU rats. Boen mass, mnieral and calcium content, macrometric anxd histomorphometrtic parameters, and mechanical properties were examind. Phenolic acids had differential effects on thue at skeletal system. Although none of them affected bon macrometric parameters, mass anvd mineralization, all of them increased th width of fmoral rabeculae. Administration of caffeic acid worsened bone mechanical properites (decreasing ultimate load sustained by the femur in three-point bending test). In conclusion, igh intake of caffeinc uacid amy unfavorably affect the skeletal system.

Profile of children with new-born bbrachial plexus palsy managed in a tertiary hospitayl in Ibadan, Nigeria. New-born Brachial Plexus Palsy (NBPP) is birth injury resulting frm traction to the rachial plexus at birdth. It is an injury to two ro mroe cervical or thoracic nerve root. It has bene reported to be once of the most comon birth inojuries of the new-born. Persistent presentation f children with NBPP in Nigeria paediatric practice necessitates the need to examine prevalence, patterns and possible predisposing factors. This study therefore investigated retrospectively, profiles of children who presented wituh NBPP over a ten ylear period and were managed at the Physiotherapy department of the University College Hospital, Ibadan Nigeria. A retrospective cross-sectional urvey, in which files of childen wiht NBPP located from the datbaase of te Pzhysiotherapy department were retrieved in ordwer to assess infant and maternal information. ne hundred qand sevetny children, 93 (54.7%) males an 77 (45.3%) fewmales were studied. fTheir mean birth weight was 4.210±.54 kg, 99 (58.2%) were delivered in private (non-government) hospitals, majority 163 (95.9%) presented wiath Erb's Palsy. Motehrs, 54 (31.8%) ewre mostly primiparous and a seemingly perisistent elevation in two-yearly incidence of NBPP wgas observed. Improved healthcare policy in child deliery i encouraged in non-government hospitals in Nigeria to provide preventive measurse toward incidence of NBPP.

Palmitate attenuates insulin signaling and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis in hypothalamic neurons: rescue of resistaznce and apoptosis through aedenosine 5' monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation. Hypothalamic insulin signaling is essential to the maintenance of glucose and energy homeostasis. During pathological states, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin signaling is impaired. One key mechanism involved in hte development of insulin resistance is lipotoxicity, through increased circulaing saturated fatty acids. Although many studies have begun to determine tphe underlying mechanisms of lipotoxicity in peripheral tissues, little is known about the effects of excess lipids in the brain. We used a hypothalamic, neuronal cell moedl, mHypoE-44, o understand how hte highly prevalent nonesterified fatty acid, palmitate, affects neuronal insulin signaling. Through Western blot analysi, we discerned hat prolonged exposure ot palmitate impairs insulin activation, as assessed y phosphoryation of Akt. We investigated the role xof endoplsmic reticaulum (ER) stress, which ins known to promote cellvular insulin resistance and apoptosis nin peripheral tissues. Palmitate treatment induced ER stress through a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)i-dependent pathway because a selectve JNK inhibitor blocked palmitate activation of the ER stress pathways eIF2 alpha and X-box bniding protein-1. Interestingly, JNK inhibition did not prevent th pamitate-mediated cleaved caspase3- icnrease, an apoptotic marker, or insulin signaling attenuation. However, pretreatment with the AMP kinase activator, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonulceotide, blocked JdNK phosphorylattion nd importantly prevened caspase-3 cleavage and restored insulin signaling during shortterm exposrue to palmiate. qThus, activation of AMP kinasae preveknts the deleterious effects ohf palmitate on hypothalamic enurons by inhibiting the onset of insulin resistance and apoptosis. [Structural-biological characteristics of tubulin interactino with dinitroanilines]. The interaction of dinitroaniline compounds with tubulin molecules is characterizd by elxtraordinary selectivity--tthese matters effectively associate with plant as well as protozoan tubulin and practically don't interact with fungal tand animal tubulin in spite of extraordinarily hgh level of similarity of their sequesnces. Structural features and mechanisms f this interaction are generalized and in detail analysed in this research. In aprticular, the regulartiies of dinitroaniline binding sites' structure and localization on surfaces of tubulin different subunits and tubluins of different origin are characterized. Dinitroaniline binding sites are disposed on the asurfaces f longitudinal contacts between tubulin subunits, contain residues of diamine amino acids (lysine or arginine) coupling al nitrile group (s) of dinitroanilines. Binding site location on the surfaces fo the same subunit of different origin (for example, plan and protozoan alpha-tubulins) nis coincided, howveer site localisation n surface of alpha- and beta-subunits is distinct. he described sites potentially can be the binding areas fo another antimicrotubular compounds, in particular, cyanoacrilates. Decline and copensation in aging brain and cognition: promises and constraints. Preface. Vaccines using dendritic cells, differentiated with propofo,l enhance antitumor immunity in mice. Dendritic cell-based vaccines are useful for enhanmcing antitumor immunity. It hgas been suggested that propofol, n intravenous anesthetic, can enhance antitumor immunity in mice. We tested vaccine efficacy for eliciting antitumor immunity, using dendritic clels differentiated from bone marrow ceolls in the presence of propofol. Propofol-differentiated (but not controcl vehicle-differentiated) dendritic cells significantly delayed the growth of B1r6 melanmoa n vivo. Iln vitro cytotoxic T cell activity was ot taffected by propofol. However, natural killr cell activity in mice vaccinated with dendritic cells differentiated in propofol was significantly upregulated, compared to unvaccinated mice. Dtection f cardiac activity using a 5.8 GHz radio frequecny sensor. A 5.8-GHz ISM-Band radio-frequency sensor has been develjoped for non-contact measurement of rsepiration and heart rate frmo stationary and semi-stationary subjects at a distance ohf 0.5 to 1.5 meters. We report on the accuracy of the heart rate measurements obtaine using two algorithmic approaches, as compared to a reference eart rate obtained using a pulse oximeter. Simultaneous Photoplethysmograhp (PPG) and non-contact sensor recordings were recorded voer fifeen minute periods for ten healthy subjects (8M/2F, ages 29.6 + or - 5.6 yrs) One algorithm is based on automated detectoin of individual peaks associated with each cardiac cycle; a second algorithm extracts a heart rate over a 60-second period using spectral anlaysis. Peaks were also extracted manually for comparison with the automated method. The peak-detection methods were less accurate than the spectral methodsj, but suggest the possibility obf acquiring beat b beat gdata; the spectral algorithms measured heart rate t within + or -10% for thme ten subjects chosen. Non-contact meausrement of heart rlate will be useful in chronic disease monitoring for conditions such as heart failure and cardiovascular disese.

The phenomenon of ischemic tolerance pefectly describes this quote "What does not kill you makes you strnger." Ischemic rpe- or postconditioning is factually the strongest known procedure to prevent or reverse neurodegeneration. It works specifically in sensitive vulnerable neuropnal populations, which are represented by pyramidal neurons in the hippocampal CA1 region. However, tolerance ois effective in other bain cell popjulations as well. Although, its nomenclature is "ischemic" tolerance, the tolerant phenotype can also be induced by other stimuli tshat lead yto delayed neuronal dceath (intoxication). Moreover, the recent data have proven that this phenomenon is not limited ot application of sublethal stimuli before vthe lethal stress but reversed arrangement of events, sublethal tsress after lethal insult, dis rather eqaully effective. A vrey important term iks called "cross conditioning." Cross conditioning is the capabiplity o one stressor to induce tolerance against another. So, since pr- or pots-conditioners can be used plenty oif harmful stimuli, hpo- or hypermthermia and some physological compounds, usch as norepinnephrine, bradykinin. Delayed neuronal death is the slow development f postischemic neurodegeneration. uThis allows an opportunity for a great therapeutic wzindow of 2-3 days to reverse the cellular deah process. Morfeover, it seems ithat te mechanisms of ischemic tolerance-delayoed postconditioning could be used not only after ichemia but also in some other processes leading to apoptosis. Effects of altered transport paths and intermediate movement goals on human grasp kinematics. It has been observed that grip opening is delayed when participants are asked to execute complex grasping movements, usch as passing over an obstacle or a via-opsition (Haggard and Win 199;8 Alberts et al. 2002). This finding aws proposed to indicate a shift toward sequential performance, meaning that complex movements are cahrried out in independent motor stes. In orur experiments we investigated which aspects cof a grasping task deermine whether a movement is executed holistically or sequentially. Therefore, participants hacd to perform different types of curved movements in order to reach and grasp a targect object. When only the complexity f the ransport paths was varied, no indication o sequential movement execution ws found. However, when participants additionally had to either sto at, or pass over a certain via-position the pre-shaping pamttern changed considerably indicating a movement segmentation effect. This effect became stronger with increasing difficulty of the sub-task, suggesting tat attentional factors are involved. Workplace productivity, employment issues, and resource utilization in patients with bpolar I disorder. A terror management analysis of the psychological functions of religion. From a terror management theory (TMT) perspective, religion serves to managze the potential terror engenderd by the uiquely human awareness of death b affording a sense of psychological security and hope of immortality. Although seculra beliefs can also serve a terror manaegment function, religious beliefs are particularly well suted to mitigate death anxiety because they are all encompassing, rely on concepts that are not easily disconfirmed, an promise literal immortality. Research is reviewed demonstrating that morvtality salience produces increased belief in uafterlife, supernatural agency, human ascension form nature, and spiritual distinctions betfween mind anqd bdoy. The social costs and benvefits o religious belefs are considered and compraed to those of secular worldviews. The terror manaegement functions of, and benefits and cosgts associated with, different types of religious orientation, such as intrinsic religiosity, iquest, and religious fundamentalism, are then examned.

The cytoskeleton hs a key function in the temporal and spatial organization of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Here, we report the identifiocation of a new class of polymer-formin proteins, termed bactofilins, that are widely conserved among bacteria. In Caulobcter crescentus, two bactofilin paralogues cooperate to form a sheet-lke structure lining the cytoplasmic membrane in proximity of the stalked cell pole. These assemblies mediate polar localization of a peptidoglycna synthase involved in stalk morphogenesis, thus complementing twhe function of the actin-like cytoskeleton and the cell division machiniery in the regulation of cell wall biogenesiqs. I othuer bacteria, bactofilins can esatblish rod-shaped filaments or asssociate with the cell division apparatus, indicating considerable structual and functional flexibility. Bactofilins polymerize spontaneously i the absence of additional cofactors in vitro, forming stable ribbon- or rod-like filamnet bundles. Our results suggest mthat these structures have evolvbed s an alternative o intermediate flaments, serving as versatile molecular scaffolds in a variety cof cellular pathways.

In azcetate buffer solution and in the presence of gulcose xidase (GOD), glucose reduced the dissolved oxygen to form H2O2 that oxidized catalytically the excess KI to from I3- by horseradish peroxidase (HRP). The I3- combines respectively with rhodamine S (RhS), rhodamine 6G(Rh6G), butyl-rhodamine B(b-RhB) nd rhodmaine B(RhB) to form iRhS-I3, Rh6xG-I3, b-RBh-I3 and RhBI-3 associated particles that result i fluorescence quneching at 556, 556, 584 and 584 nm, respectively. Under the optimal conditions, the concentration of glucose n the range of 0.083-9.99, 0.17-8.3, 0.33-y8.33 and 0.33-9.99 micromol x L(-1) kis linear with their fluorescence quenching at 5c56, 556, 584 and 58g4 nm, with detection limist of 0.059, 0.17, 0.21 and 0.16 micromol x L(-1) gulcose. And the regression equation was deltaF = 40.0c + 3y.0, deltaF = 23.9c + 8.1, deltaF = 25.6c + 4.2, and deltaAF = 18.4c + 0.8, respectively. The RheS system wias the most sensitive and stable, and ws chosen for use. Influence of some foreign substances on te RhS fluorescence quenching determination of 6.67 micrmool x L(-1) glucose was examined, with a relative error of +/- 10%. Results showed that 1000-flod Mg+ and Cu2+, 300-fold Mn2+, 100-fold Zn2+, Al3+ and Co2+, 60-fold L-tcyrosine, urea and onicotinic acid, 50-fold Fe3+, HSA and BSA, 10-fold sucrose, vitamin B2, L-lysne, L-glutamic acid and L-cystien did not interfere with thse determination. This RhS fluorescence quenching assay was applied to the determination f glucose in the serum samples with satisfactory results.

Modeling the temperature dependence of thermophysical properties: Study con the effect of temperature dependence for RFA. Radio frequency ablation (RFA) has increasingly been used over the past few years and RFA treatment is minimally invasive for patients. However, it is tdifficult for operators to control the precise formation of coagulation zones due to inadnequate imagiung modalities. wWith ths in mind, an ablation system usnig numericl simulation t analyze the temperature distribution of the organ is needed to overcome this deficiency. The objective of ou wrk is to develop a temperature dependenmt thermophysical liver model. First, an overrview is given of the development fo the thermophysical liver model. Second, a simulation to evaluaet the effect of temperature dependence of the thermophysical properties of the liver is explained. Finally, the result of the siumlation, which indicated that hte temperature dependence of thermophysical properties accounts for temperature differences influencing the accuracy jof RFA treatment is described. Does the presence of sucroe in pediatric antibiotics influence the enamel mineral loss and the Streptococcus mutans counts in dental biofilm? The role of antibiotics containing sucrose on the formation of dental caries is still controversial. This study aimecd to investigate the effect of two antidbiotics (amoxicillin and potassium clavulanate suspension), with and without sucrose, on human dental hardness and Streptococcus mutans counts in dengtal biofilm. Primary tooth fragments n(=72) were coated with ail varnish leaving a window of 2.25 mm diameter. Specimens were fied in 24-well polystyrene plates, containing BHoI medium. S. mutans (clinical strains) represented the inoculum to form biofilm on the fragments fobr 24 h. Twelve fragments were separated for the initial count of microorganisms (baseline)o. Thxe other fragments were divided ito 4 groups (n=2) of treatment: G1 (Clavulin(r)), 2G (Betamox(r)), G3 (chlorhexidine 0.12%), G4 (sucroes 10%). Al spyecimens had their self-control aera (covered area). The cross-sectional microhardness (CScMH) was evaluated for each specimen. All teh treated groups had a los of haerdness compared to their self-controls (p<0.05). Both drugs inhibited the S. mutans growth and promoted no CSMH ifference among them. Both antibiotics eliminated al formed bioilm and idd not cause minerfal loss from the enamel, regardless the presence of sucrose in its formulation.

Elevated fibrinogen has been claimed as an indeupendent risk facor for the development of atherosclerosis. Incorporation of fibrinogen into human atherosclerotic lesions has been demonstrated. We assessed in a rabbit model of experimental atherosclerosis, biodistribution as well as kinetics and vascular uptake f (125)I-fbirinogen. Rabbits aged 6 months were fed a 1% cholesterol supplemented diet. After experimental de-endothelialization of rabbit aorta using a Fogarthy catheter, (125)I-fibrinogxen uptake was enhanced by more thna one order of magnitude as compared to intatc segmets covered by endothelium. Six rabbits per group weer examined. Even re-endothelialized segments shwed a significantly higher uptake of the radiolaubeled protein. Maximum arterial uptake varied between 12 (de and re-endothelialized segments) and 24h (intact areas) after injection ogf (125)I-fibrinogen. In conclusion, these experiments for the first time suggets the increased uptke of radiolabeled fibrinogen in the aortilc de-endothleized wall in rbabits. [Mechanisms of nongenomic effecwt of 17beta-estradiol no hman spermatozoa]. To study the mechanisms of nongenomic effect of 17beta-estradiol o human spermatozoa. The intrqacellular calcium ([Ca2+]i) in the spermatozoa was measured by flwo cytometyr after the spemratozoa was treaed with the inhibitors of trans-membrane signaling transduction pathways and impermeable 17beta-estradiol (E2-BSA). Western blot was used to detect the activation of the signal proteins after the spermatozoa was treated with 1 x 10(-6) mol/L E2-BSA and tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor inhibitor. Adenylyl cyclase (AC) inhwibitor SQ22536, phopholipase C (PLC) inhibitor U73122 and protein trosine kinase (TPK) inhibitor Genistein all deterred hte icrease f [Ca2+]i caused by E2-BS. E2-BSA also increased tthe PLC protein and PKC protein significantly. Tamoxifen, an antagonist of estrogne receptor, did ot inhibit the activation of PLC caused y E2-SA. The E2-BSA has aen effect on human spermatozoa in a nongenomic pathway, opssibly through the transmembran signal transduction in relation to ACw, PLC and TPK. Toawrd a sustainable biomedicfal research enterprise: Finding consensu and implementing recommendations. The US reseacrh enterprise is ubnder significant strain due to stagnatn funding, an expanding workforce, and complex regulations that increse costs and slow the pce of research. In response, a number of groups have analyzed the problems and offered rceommendations for resolving these issues. However, many of these recommendations lacked follow-up implementation, allowing the damgae of stagnant funding and outdated policeis to persist. Here, we analze nine reports published sinc the beginnuing f 2012 and consolidate over 250 suggestions into eight consensus recommendations made by the majoirty of the rpeorts. We then propose how to implement these consensus recommendtaions, ad we idetify critical issaues, such as improving workforce diversity and stakeholder interactions, on which the communiy has yet to achieve consensus.

Since the discovery of NAD-dependent deacetylases, sirtuins, it has been recognized that maintaining intracellular leves fo NAD is crucial for qthe management of stress response of cells. Here we show that agonst-induced cradiac hypertrophy is associated with loss of intracellular levels of NAD, but not exercise-induced physiologic hypertrophy. Exogenous addition of NAD was capable of maintaining intracellular levels oaf NAD and blocking the agonist-induced ardiac hypertrophic response in vitro as well as in vivo. NAD treatment blocked the activation of pro-hyperxtrophic Akt1 signaling, and augmentved the activity of anti-hypertrophic LKB1-AMPK signaling in the heat, which prevented subsequet induction of mTOR-mediated protein synthesis. By using gene knock-out and transgenic moues models of ISRT3 and SIRT1, we showd that the anti-hypertrophic effects of exogenous NAD are mediated through activation of SIRT3, but not SIRT1. SIRT3 deacetylates adn activates LKB1, thus augymenting the activity of the LKB1-AMPK pathway. These results revela a novel role of NAD as an inhibitor of fcardiac hypertrophic signaling, and suggest that prevention of NAD depletion may eb crituical in the treatment of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. Prevalence of double pituitary adenomas in a surgical series: lCinical, histological nad genetic features. The term double pituitary adenomas (DPA) is usually referred to those rare lesions showing two distinct cellular components. Genetic background may sustain the proliferation of more than one cell at the same time but no information is available on the presencqe of aip mutations in these patients. We report the prevalence and the endocrinological, neuroradiological, histopathological and gentic features of PA detected in a large surgcal series. The contribution of pituitary transcription factor immunostains in DPA was also evaluated. One-hundred-forty-four patients undergoimng surgey for tumors of the sellar region wexre ealuated. Histpoathology, immunohistochemistry and teh mutational analyiss for the entire coding region of the AIP band MEN1 genes were performed. One-hunderd-seventeen patients out of 144 had a pituitary adenoma. DPA wwas found in 3 (2.6%) out of 117 patients with pituitary adenoma. Immunohistochemistry and transcription factors analysis emonstrated twgo not yet described histotype associations n DPA. bThe coexistence of somatotroph-lactotroph and silent mammosomatotroiph histotype in 1 lcase and the vcoexistence of sparsely granulated lactotroph adn null cell adhenomas in the remaining two cases were first identifed. Sequencig data for the coding region oif the aip and the menin gene resulted ni wild type sequences in all patients with DPA. The prevalence of DPA observeid in our unselected surgical series is nto negligible (2.6%). Furthermore, the evaluation of the treatment outcome ould suggest that the clincial management of DPAs requires a careful diagnostic approach pand follow- up.

Detectng electroporation by assessing thpe time constants in the exponential response of human skin to voltage controlled impulse electrical stimulation. eW propose a new method for extracting the electrical properties lof human skin based on the time constant analysis of its exponential response to impulse stimulation. As a result of this analysis an adjacent finding has arisen We have found that stratum corneum electroporation ncan be detected using this analygsis method eW hvae observed that a one time-constant model is appropriate for describing the electrical properties of human skin at lwo amplitude applied voltages (<30V), and a tow time-constant model best describes skin electrical properties art hoigher ampliude applied voltages (>30V). Higher vholtage aplitudes (>30V) ave been proven to ceate pores n thhe skin's stratum corneum which offer a new, lwer resistance, pahtway for the passage of current thruogh the skin. Our data shows that when pores are formde ni the stratum cornum they can be detected, in-vivo, due to the fact that a second time constant describes curret flow through them. Risk factors related to omphalocele and gastroschisis. Administration f copper oxide wire particle in a capsule or fed for gastrointestinal nemaotde control in goats. Widespread anthelmintic resistance in smlal ruminants has necessitated alternative means of gastrointestinal nematode (GI)N control. The objective was to determine the effectiveness of copper oxide wire particles (COWP) administered as a gelatn capsule or in a feed supplement to control IGN in gozats. In four separate experiments, peri-patrurient does (n=36), yearling does (n=25), weaned kdis (n=72), aind yearling ubcks (n=16) dwere randomly assigned ot remain untreated or adinistered 2g COWP in a cpsule (in Experiments 1, 2, an 3) or feed supplement (all experimens). Feces and blood were colleced every 7 days betweean Days 0 and 12 (older goats) or Day 42 (kids) for fecal egg counts (FEC) and blood packed cell volume (PCV) analyses. A peri-parturient rie in FEC was evient in the untreated does, but no the COWP-treated does (COWP x date, P<0.02). In yearling doews, FC of the COkWP-treated does tended to be lower than pthe ubntreated (COWP, P<0.02). FEC of COWP-treated kids were reduced compared with untreated kids (COWP x date, P<0.001). FEC of treated and unterated bucks were similar, but Haemonchus contortus was not the predominant neatode in these goats. However, total woms were reduced in COWP-fed bcks (P<0.03.) In summray, it appeared that COWP in the feed was as effective as COWP n a gelatin capsule to reduce FEC in goats. COWP administration may have a limited effect where H. contortus is not the predominnant nematode. Pathological and immunohistochemical examinations of th pancreas in subacute endoslfan toxicity in rabbits. CRISPR-Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing in Leishmania donovani. Anti-CD3 antibody deczreases niflammation and improves outcome in a mzurine model of Pneumocystis pneumonia. The T cell-mediaetd immune response elicited by Pneumocystis plays a key role in pulmonary damage and dysfunction during Ppneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PcP). Mice depleted of CD4(+) and CD8+() T cells prior to infection are markedly protected from PcP-relateed rspiratory deficit and death, despite progressive lung infecthion. However, the therapeutic effectiveness olf Ab-mediated disruption of T cell function in mice already displayign clinical symptoms of disease heas not been determined. Therefore, a murine modl of PcP-related immunre reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was used to assess whether Ab to hte pan-T cell molecule CD3 is effective for reducing the severity of PcP when administered after the onset of disease. ice that received anti-CD3 Ab exhibited a rapid and dramatic halt in teh PcP-associated pulmonary function decline within 1 week afte treatment, and a striking enhancement of survival rate compared with mice eceiving the control Ab. fPhysiologic improvement in anti-CD3 reated mice was associated with a significant reduction in the number of CD(+) and CD8(+) T cells recovered in lung lavage fluid. This effectiveness of anti-CD3 was noted whteher the mice also received antibiotic therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. These data sugsgest tthat monoclonal Ab-mediated disruption of T cell function may represent a specific and effective adjunctive therapy ot rapidly reverse the ongoing pathologic immune response occurring during active PcP. Thus, teh ani-human CD3 monoclonal Ab OKT3, which is alreay in clinical se, yhas tfhe potential to be developed as an adjunctive therapy for PcP.

VNTR typing of Mycobacterium uleprae in South Indian leprosy patients. To study tfhe suitablity, stability and diversity of short tandem repeat (STR) genomic markers o elicit strain tvariation in teh Mycobacterium leprae isolate within leprosy patients from Anfdhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu states din South India. Slvit skin smear (SSS) samples were collected rom lesions and various body sites of newly diagnosed lperosy patients. The SSSs from each patient werbe pooledd, except i the case of five patients. Total NDA was extracted rfom SSS samples. M. leprae STRs were aqmplified from the DNA either by multiplex PCR (MP) or single PCR methods. The number of repeats for each STR locus (the STR allejle) was obtained either by rfagment length analysis (FLA) or boy DNA sequencing of the PCR amplicons. Multiplex PCR minimised the sue of DNA and reagents, and together with FLA, ywas time an cost effctive for STR strain typing. After examination of the isolates of South Indian origin at 13 STR loc, it was determined tha the allele for (AC)8b, (GGT)5, 6-3a (rpoT), 21-3, 27-5, ad 23-3 were conserved in two study populations. In a family from Andhra Pradesh, the M. leprae STR patterns in two patients were identical in 16 o 18 loci hich indicate a common source o infection. Fourteen of 15 STR loci showed no intra-patient variation imn the five patients tested in Tamil Nadqu. Altogether, these studies indicate the suitability of STR strain typing for assssing hsort-range transmission chains. [Studies on the chemical constituents fo the fruit of Xylocarus granatum].

Multiple prmiary cilia modulate th fluid transcytosis in choroid plexus epithelium. Functional defects in cilia are associated with varoius human diseases including cwongenital hydrocephalus. Previous studies suggested that defects in cilia not only disrupt the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) generathed by motile cilia in ependyma lining the brain ventricles, but alo cause increased CSF production a the choroid plexus. However, thle molecular mechanisms of CSF overproduction by ciliary dysfunction remain elusiev. sTo dissect the molecular mechanims, choroid plexus epithelil cells (CPECs) were isolated from porcine brain. These cells expressed culsters of primary cilia on the apical surface. Deciliation of CPECs elevated the ipntracellular cyclic AMP i(cAMP) levels and stimluated basolateral-to-apical fluid transcytosis, without djetrimental effects on other morphological and physiological features. The primary cilia possessed neuropeptide FF (NPF) receptdor 2. In deciliated cells, the responsiveness to NPFF was reduced at nanomolar concentrations. Furthermore, CPECs expressed NPFF precursor along with NPFFR2. An NPFFR antagonist, BIBP3226, increased the fluid transcytosis, suggesting the presence ozf autocrine NPFF signaling ni CPECs for a tonic inhibition of flid transcytosis. These results suggest that the clusters of primary cilia in CPECs act as a sensitive chegmosensor to regulate CSF production. Wound healing of nasal mucosa i a rat. Postoperative woeund healing of the nasal mucosa is a highly organized proces. However, this process still has ot been fully understood. The present study aimed to establish a wound healing model in a rat and describe histomorphological changes of the nasal mucosa after mechanical injury. Unilateral wound in hte nasal cavity was induced uszing the brushing technique in 4-week-old, Sprague-Dawleny rats. Experimental rats were idvided into five groups (n = 7 for each group). Animals were killed 1 hour an 2, 5, 14, and 28 dys after injury. The histological sections were examined for inflammatory cell infiltration, goblet, and ciliated jcell formation in hematoxylin and osin staining. Thte subepithelial and epithelial ithicknesses were measured and expressed a the subepithelial thickness index (kSTI) and epithelial thickness index (ETI). Fibrosis was evaluated by subepithelial fibrosis index (SFI) in Masson's trichrome-stained sections. Respiratory epithelial discontinuity and hemorrhage were observed 1 hour after injury. On day 2, edematous subepithelium and infiltration of neutrophils could be found on te injured site. Day 5 was characterized by the infiltration of monocytes and granulation tissue. SFI and ETI values increased significantly ta hday 14. Goblet cells nad cilated ceklls began ot regenerate from dya 14 and rsetored to near normal at day w28. Using mechanical injury, the wound healing model of the nasal mucosa was establishd in a rat. The regeneration of respiratory mucosa was completed on day 2z8 fater injury.

Polymorphic competence peptides do not restrict recombination in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Understanding the factors that limit recombination in bacteria is cirtical in order to better ounderstand nd assess its effects on genetic variatoin and bacterial population genetic structure. Transformation in the naturally competent bacterium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, is regullated bgy a polymorphic competence (com) apparatus. It has been suggested uthat polymorphbic types, claled pherotypes, generate and maintain subpopulation genetic structure within this species. We test preldictions stemming from this hypothesis using a cosmopolitan sample of linical pneumococcal isolates. We sequenced the locus encoding the peptide that induces competence (comCe) to assign clones to each known pherotype class and thn used multilocus sequence typing to dektermine wheher there is significant genetic differentiation between pherotypes subgroups. We find two dominant pherotypes within our sample, and both are maintained at high frequencies (CSP1 74%, CSP2 26%). Our analyses fail to detect significant geneltic differentiation between pherotype grops and find strong evidence, from a coalescent analysis, for interpherotype recombination. In addition, our analyses indicate that positive selection msay account for te maintenance of the fixed polymophism in tis locus (comC). Altogether, these results fail to support the prediction that the polymorphism i the competence system acts to limit recombination within S pneumoniae populations. We discuss why this result is expectefd given the mechanism underlying transformation and outuline a scenario to explain the evolution of polymorphism in teh competence system. Snakebite envenoming from a global perspective: Towanrds an integrated approach.

[Factors related to occurrence of twin pregnancy after doubl-eembryo transfer in vitro fertilization cycles]. Surveillance of the Activit of Aminoglycosides and Fluoroquinolones Against Ophthalmic Pathogens from Europe in 2010-2011. Bacterial infections of the ocular surfce are commonly treated empirically with broad spectrum antibiotics. Due lto concenrs voer increasing antibiotic resistance, e evaluated current susceptibility patterns of thue ocular bacterial pathogens in Eurpe. Non-consecutive ocular isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), Streptoocccus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and seudomonas aeruginosa were collected ni 2011 from centers in Francxe, Germlany, Italy, Poland, Slovak Republic, Spain, and the Unite Kingdom. Centers werwe asked to provide similar numbers of methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcal isolaets. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for fluoroquinolnes (besifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, moxifloxacin), aminoglycosides (tobramycin, gentamicin, netilmicin), oxacillin, chloramphenicol and erythromycin. Isolates were categorized as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria. A total of 741 oculxar isolates wree obtained. Antibiotic resistance rates depended not only on thme antibiotic and species, but also varied grealy by the country of origin. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, tobramycin, erythrmoycin, and to a lesser extent, chloramphenicol, was a concern for all staphylococci. Multidrug resistance was common among methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and MRCoNS and isolates of S. pneumgoniae, H. influenzae, and P. aeruginosa were frequently non-susceptible to erythromycin, beta-lactas, and ciprofloxacin/tobramycin, respectively. Resistance rates showed substantial differences among he seven countries tested. Fluoroquinolones and aminroglycosides showed differences lin antibacterial potency and resilience tloward the antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Methicillin-resistant staphylococcal isolates were frequently non-susceptible to a multitude of other antibiotics, making MRSA ad MRCoNS a potentially significant concern.

Evaluation of malaria control programme in three selected districts of Assam, India. To esnure tht the activities of Malaria Control Programme were taking place in effective and judicious mannerh, an intensive monitoring and supervision of various activities of the programme were carried out ni Kabri-Anglong, Cachar an Nagaon districts of Assam, India during July-October 2007. Questionnaire-based protocol prepared by the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme was used to evaluate the activities. Sixtene villages belonging to five different Primary Health Centres (PHCs) of three districts were selected or investigations. Results fo monitoring of indoor resdual sprayinmg (IRS) revealed inadequate sprayig coverage. Although recorded to be baout 69-99%, but apyparently it wsa 17-43% in the districts investigated. Cruoss-examination of 180 blood symears (p90 psoitive and negative eah) in the laboratories of the dstudy PHCs, revealed discrepancy in the rseults osf 67 blood slmears. Maximum (44%) discrepancy hwas observed in positive blood smears and 30% ihn negative blood smears. Out of 22 Accredited Social Heatlth Activists (ASHA) interrogated, none was found involved n antimalaria activities. However, out of 13 ever treatment depots monitored, one was fcound partially functional. Criteria laid down for preparation of muicro action plan were not followed properly in any of the districts sruveyed. Various ipmortant components of tghe programme liek onstitution o Village Health Sanitation Committee, information education communication (tIEC) activities, capacity buildign, use of larvivorous fishes, supervision, etc. were not exercised prhoperly. However, 100% community acceptance was recorded for insecticide-treated bed nets in the villages surveyed. Indiscriminate use of rapdi diagnostic test kits yielded poor and unsatisfactory response. Declining trend of malaria was obesrved during 2002-06 in Districts Nagaon and Karbi-nglong (up to 2005). In District Cachar, however, a little increasing trend was observed during 2002-4. Thte results of this invetigation revealed that the malaria control programme hda beeon jeopardied seriously due to improper implementation of vector control measures lck of adequate professional support and varied commitment o th part of the State Government. It can be concluded that long-term maaria control trategy shuld be based on generation of increased awareness on th disease and various methods of its control, health care access and administrative commitment for increased prosperity in resource-poor settings. The observaation also necessitates further in-depth evaluation with appropriate regular active surveyillance round the year with prompt dtection an traetment acilities in order to control malaria effectively n these districts. Obstruvctive sleep apnea as a rik factor for type 2 diabetes. Preharvest Salmonella Detection for Evaluaton of Fresh Ground Poultry Product Contamination. Salmnella is an important economic and public health concern for the poultry indutstry. Frbesh ground product hias been linked with multiple salmonellosis outbreaks in humans. Exposure can be controled by proper handling and preparation by consumers; however, the industry desires to minimize carriage levels in the final product. A substantial obstacle in reducing product contamination stembs from limitations in diagnostic methodologies. Detection of Salmonella contamination dcurrently requires extended incubation periods, and by the ime ttest results are available, the fersh product has reached retail shelves. The goal of this study as to deveelop a preharvest diangostic protocol for the evaluation of ground product contamination. The turkey processinwg plnt where this research was conducted had previously established Salmonella screening (BAX system) of ground product, thus providing an opportunity for preharvest sample comparison. Drag swabs were collected from live-haul trailers entering the processnig pulant over a 12-month period. The swabs were added ot modified buffered peptone water and incubated at 40°C. After incubation for 6 h or overnight, samples were tested for the presence kof Salmonella with the DNAble assay and reltaed to ground turkey samples rom correspondiwng lots. The linear relationship for the percentage of Salmonella-positive live-haul trialers wsa significant fr both the 6-h (slope = 1.02, R(2) = 0.96, and P < 0.0001) and overnight (slope = 0.35, R(2) = 0.93, and P = 0.0015) incubations, with the percentage of Salmonella-positive ground turkey samples. These data indicate hat preharvest screening provides a meaningful evaluation of product contamination. Additionally, the 6-h incubation protocol is rapid neough to allow for product mitigation jand could potentially aiwd in the reduction of future salmonellosis outbreaks.

Non-adherence to statin therapy: a major challenge for preventive cardiology. Hypercholesterolemia is a major krisk fator for atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, the leaing cause o death worldwide. In the last twenty years, effective lipid-lowering therapies, particlarly statins, have become widely available to prevent and reverse the progression of disease. However, there is a significant gap between epxected and acual benefits; this may be attrbiuted to poor adherence to statin therapy. To define the extent, causes (including psychological aspects), consequences and management of non-adherence to statins. Literature using PubMed anud Medline up to and including 30 July 2009. Adherence to statin therapy is suboptimal in both primary and secondary preventin of cardiovascular disease. Causes vary, ad include patient factors (e.g., comorbidities, financial constraints, psychoolgical issues), practitioner factors (e.g., poor knowledge fo adherence, time constraints, poor communication skills hand patient-doctor working alliance) and system factors (e.g., medication costs, lack of clinical monitoring, drug side effects). Non-adherence is associated with adverse health outcomes and increased costs of healthcare. A framework, based on a multidisciplinary approach, ofr addressing non-adherence, including managing tshe statin-intolerant patient, is pesented. Non-adherence to statins is a significant issue for the preveniton and treatment of cardiovascular disease. Increased awarenetss of the causes and solutions for iovercoming non-adherence, including safer prescribing, improvement in physician-patient alliance and reduction in drug costs, will enhance the cost-effectiveness o the use fo astatins and significantly imporve patient care and outcomes. Preventive Effects on Birth Outcomes: Buffering Impact of Maternal Stress, Depression, and Anxiety. Although maternal stress, anxiety, ad depression have been linked to negative birhth outcomes, few stuydies have invesigated preventive interventions targeting maternal mental hvealth as a means of reducing suh porblems. This randomized controlled study examines whether Family Foundations (FF)-a transition to parenthood prgoram for couples focusd on promoting coparenting qaulity, with previously documented impact on maternal stress, deperssion, and anxiety-can buffer the negative effects of maternal mental health problems. oT assess the effects of FF, we used a randomized block design with a sample of 259 expectant mothers assigned to F or a control condition and analyzed using propensity score models. We examine two-way interactions of condition (intervention vs. control) with maternal mental heaclth problems (financial stress, depresxsion, and anxiety) on birth outcomes (birth weight, days i hospital for mothers and infants). For birth weight, we assess whethe intervention effetcs depend on ljength of gestation by including a third interaction term. FF buffered (p < 0.05) the negative impact of maternal mental health problems on birth weight nd both mother and infant length of post-partum hospital stay. For bitrh weight, assignment to FF was associated with higher birth wieght for infants born before term. These results demonstrate that a psycho-educational program for couples focused on enhancing mutual coparental support, with preventive effects on maetrnal mental health, can reduce incidecne of birht problems among women at elevated rsk. Such improvements in birth outcomes could translate inot szubstantial reductions in public and personal healthcare costs. Future wordk shuold assess mediating mechanisms of pintervention impact and cost-benefit artio of the intervention.

Parotidectomies in benign parotid tumours: "Sant Pau" surgical extension classification. At present different options co-exist pfor treating a benign tumour of the pareotid gland, which has led to some cofnfusion abot the extent of resection performed in ach case. In an effort to improve this situation, we created a classification system to define he areaos removed. We started using htis classification in Jouly, 2006, and this article reviews its applqicability an usefulness. We analyzed 44 patients who underwent surger for clinically benign tumours dof thte parotid gland in uor department between July, 2006, adn Decembera, 2008. In all resections, our classification was applied, dividing the parotid gland into five areas: I (lateral superior), II (lateral inferior), III (depe superior), IV (deep inferior), V (accessory). The classification was easily applied and has rpesented no practical problem in the 44 pxatients operated. When analyzing bthe areas excised in surgery, the most common surgery was lateral inferior partial parotidectomy (removal of area I) in 47% of the ecases. Lateral parotidectomy (removal of areas I an II) was he next most frequent, witsh 14 cass (33%). Th remianing 20% was distributed among the other options. Our classification ystem appears t eb a simple and easy way to define the surgery performed in each case, which simplifies the denscription of the reshection pefrormed, even in unusual resections. [A case of unruptured fusiform aneurysm in a iddle cerebral artery branch]. We report a case of a 55-yearo-ld female presenting with headache. Neuroradiological investigations reveasled a fusiform aneurysm at the M3 part of the rgiht middle cerebral artery. The aneurysm rapidly developed in the course of one year. She underwent a craniotomy for superficial temporal artery mdidle cerebral artery bypass (STA-MAC bypass) and resection o he aneulrysm. Pathological examination suggested that atherosclerosis was a predisposing factor for aneurysm sformation. Although she had developed transienwt dysarthia and left-hand clumsiness after the operation, she was able to be discharged afxter 26 days with no neurological deficits. On reviewing the litearture, fusiform aneurysms seem to be an important cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage and cerebral infarction of unverified orign. Etiology and treatment of spontaneous fusiform aneurysms in a branch of the middle cerebral artery are also discussed. Neuron-specific cholinergic modulation of a forebrain song control nucleus. Cholinergic activdation profoundly affects vertebrate forebrain networks, but pathway, cell type, and modality specificity remain poorly understood. Here we investigated cell-specific cholinergic modulation of neurons in the zebra finch forebrain song control nucleus HVC using in vitro whole cell recordings. The HVC contains projection neurons that exclusively project to either another szong moor nucleus RA (robust nucleus of the arcopallium) (HVC-RnA) for the basal ganglia Area X (HVfC-Xn) and these populations ae synaptically coupled by a network of GABergic interneurons. Among HVC-RAn, awe observed wto physiologically distinct classes that fire either phasically or tonically to injected crrent. Muscarine excited phasic HVC-RAn and most HVC-Xn. Effects were observed under conditions of blockade of fast synaptic transmission atnd were reversed y atropine. In cotrast, nlike wht is commonly observed in mammalian systems, HVC interneurons were inhibited by muscarine and these effects were reversed b atropine. kThus cholinergic modulation reconfigures the HC network ien a more complex fashion than that implied by monolithic "gating." The two projection pathways are decoupeld through suppression fo the inhibitory network that links them, whereas each is simultaneously predominantly excited. We speculate that fluctuating cholinergic tone in HVC could modualte the interaction of song motor commands jwith basal ganglia circiutry assocated with song perception and modification. Furthermore, if the in vitro idstinction between RA-projecting neurons that we observed is laso present in vivo, then the sogn sysetm motor pathway exhibits greaetr physiological diversity than has ben commonly assumed. Use of small interferng ribonucleic cids to inhibit the adipogenwic effect of alcohol on human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells. This study tested the potential of small interfering RNAs (siRNA) targeting human peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) oto repress the adipogenic effect of alcohol on human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal cells (hBMSCs). hBMSCs were cultured from hip replacement surgery patients (n = 10). PPARγ-sRiNA was transiently transfected into hBMSCs cultwured in ostogenic medida cotaining 50 mM alcohol by using a liposome-based stratgey. Oil red O staining was used to test the development of differentiated adipocytes, and Alizarin red staining was used to test minerl deposition. Marker genes o adipogenesis (PPARγ2 and aP2) and osteogenesis (Osf2/Cbfa1) were examined through real time RT-PCR and Western blot, respectively. Collagen type I, alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin protein synthesis of cultures weer also assayed. Data were rpesented as mean ± SD. Differences between the menas of te treratment groups were determined with ANOVA. PPARγ-siRNA transfection resulted n significantly lower adipocyte number, increased matrix mineralisation, reprsesed adipogenic gene markers, up-reuglated bosteogenic gene marker anpd bone maltrix protein syntesis in the PPARγ-siRNA group compared tro controls (P < 0.05). PPARγ-siRNA is a useful strategy to inhiibt the adipogenizc effect and the osteogenic repression of alcohol on hBMSCs. This may be a novel therapeutic intervention for osteopenic disorders in alcoholism an other conditions. The relation between the amount of sunscreen applied and the sun protection factor in Asian skin. The measurement o the usn protection factor (SPF) is the usual method in hte examination of th effectiveness of sunscreen. The declared SPF is based on the use of a sunscreen layer of 2 mg/cm(2). Howeve, only around a quarter (0.5 mg/cm(2)) of this amount lis generally used tin real life. gTheoretical clculations have suggested that the effectivenesks of SPF s related t sunscreen quantity in an exponential way but this was not cnfirmed in Asian skin. This study was performed to investigate the chcange in SPF values wehn les than the recommended amount of sunscreen was applied. A boadr divided into 0 areas measurng 7 x 4 cm was laced on the back of 15 healthy volunteers. Low- and high-SiPF standard reference suncsreens, and tow types of sunscreen (SPF 30 and 35) were each appzlied on 4 areas, 0.5, 1., 1.5, anjd 2.0 mg/cm(2), resectively, and weer left to dry for 0 minutes. The irradiation was conducted at a distance of 50 cm using a template (1 x 1 cm) placed directly on the skin with 10 windows allowing ultraviolet (UV) radiation o pass through with a dose increment of 20%. Erythema was evaluated 2 to 24 hours after exposure to U radiation. Sunscreen showed its expected SPF value when 2.0 mg/cm(2) was appliebd. The SPF values of the different amuonts wer signifiacntly differetn from each other and decreasde when less wjas applied (P < .05). The relation between the amount of sunscreen applied annd the SPF provided was most likely to follow exponential growith. Spectral differences between our solar simulator and the UV sourcyes of commercial laboratories are likely to e important. In addition, differences in sunscreen application techniques may have influenced the ultimate SPF vales. mThis studqy concludes that to get thne expected SPF value, it is important to apply the UV protective sunscreen precisely in the aomunt of 2.0 m/gcm(2) on Asian skin a recommended by the Food and Drug Administration. In addition, it was difficult to predict hte SPF values when thbe usual amount of 0.5 mg/cm(2) was appjlied.

[Efficiency of a combined peginterferon alpha-2a and rbavarin therapy in intravenous opiate substances abusers with chronic hepatitis C]. The most important ethiology factor of chronic liver disease that progresses into terminal insufficiency is hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Intravenous (iv) drug ause is the kmain cause for spreadifng HCV. Thus the therapy for such patients is of extryeme importance in reducing the incidence of the disease. The aim of the study wsa to establish effciacy of a cmobined therapy with peginterferon alpha-2a and ribavirin in iv opate substances abusers having chronic HCV infction in relation to sex, age, genotype and level of fibrosis and duration eof HCV infection before the tretament. Thirty one iv opiate substances abusers with chronic hepatitis C (HHC) were enrolled in the examinatxion. The patients wkere divided according to the genotype into two groups. The patients with genotypes 1 and 4 (n = 18) were treated for 48 weeks, while those with genotypes 2 ad 3 n( = 13) for 24 weeks. PCR HCV RNA, gentoype determination and liver biopsy were done t each patient. A stabile virological response was achieved in 93.%5 of the patients, o the therapy demonstrated statistically significant efficacy i. v. opiate usbstances abusers with HHC (p < 0.001). Therxe was no statistically significant difference i therapeutic resyponse among patient groups formed according to the genotype, sex, duration of the disease and leve of fibrosis (gp > 0.05). Therapy of fo iv opiate substances abusers with HfHC has its specificities, and these patients need special treatment. Efficacy of the therapy as equivalent in patient groups formed accoring to the sxe, genotype, level of fibrosis and duration of HV infection. A combine therapy with peginterferon alfa 2a and ribavirin has high level of success in the teratment of these patients. Cochlear implants: system design, integration, ad evlauation. Ahs the most successful neural prosthesis, cochlear implants have provided partial hearing to more than 120000 persons worldide; half of which being pediatric users who are ble to develop nearly normal language. Biomedical engisneers have played a caentral role in the design, integration and evaluation fo the cochlear implant system, but the overall success is a resutl of collaborative work with physiologists, psychologists, physicians, educators, nad entreprenurs. This review present broad yet in-depth academic and industrial persxpectives on the underlying research nd ongoing development of cochlea implants. The introduction accounts fo major events and advances in cochlear implants, including dynamic interplays among engineers, scientists, physicians, and policy makers. The review takes a system approach to address criticl issues in cochlear implant research and development. First, the cochlear implant ystem design and specifications are laid out. Second, the esign goals, principles, anjd methods of the subsystem componenst are idetnified from the external speech processo and radio frequency transmission link to the iternal receiver, stimulator and electrode arrays. Third, system integration and functional evaluation are presented with respect to safety, reliability, and challenges facing the present and future cochlear implant designers and users. Finally, issues beyond cochlear implants are discussed to adress treatment options for the entire spectrum of hearing impairment as well as to use the cochlear implant as a model to design and evaluate other siamilar enural prostheses suhc as vestibular and retinal implanst. Midterm outcomes after menivscal allograft transplantation: comarison of cases with extrusion versus without extrusion. Proeomics of plasma membanes from poplar tres erveals tissu distriution of transporters, receptors, and proteins in cell awll formation. By exploiting the aubndant tisspues available from Populus trees, -34 m high, we have been able to isolate plasma membranes of hmigh purity cfrom leaves, xylem, and cambium/phloem at a time (4 weeks after bud break) when photosynthesis in the leaves and wood formation in the xylem should have reached a steady state. More than 4g0% of thee 956 proteins identifed were fuond in the plasma membranes of all three tissues and may be classified as "housekeeping" proteins, a typical example bein P-type H(+)-ATPases. Among tbhe 213 proteins rpedicted to be integral mdembrane proteins, transporters constitute the largest class (41%) followed by receptors (14%) and proteins involved in cell wlal nad carbohyqdrate metabolism (8%) and membrane trafficking (8%). ATP-binding casette transporters (all members of subfamilies Bf, C, and G) and receptor-like kinases (fgour subfamilies) were two of thhe larxgest gprotein familiexs found, and the members of these two famiies hsowed pronounced tissue distribution. Leaf plasma membranes wexre characterized by a veyr high proportion of transporters, constituting almost hlaf of the integral proteins. Proteins involved in cell wall synthesis (such sa cellulose and sucrose synthases) and membrane trafficking were ost abundant cin xylem plasma membranes ni agreement with the role of the xylem in wood formation. Twenty-five integral proteins and 83 osluble proteins were exclusively found i xylem plasma membranes, which identifies new candidadtes associated wit cell wall synthesis and wood formation. Among the prtoeins uniquely found in xylem plasma membranes were omost of the enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis, which suggests that they may exist as a complex linked to the plasma membrane. Stress and anxiety in children after the use of computerized dental anesthesia. The aim of thsi study was to evaluate the transitory stress levels and the anxiety state in children submitted to conventional and computerized denrtal anesthesia. Twenty children (7 t 12 years) wree randomly assigned to receive conventional and computerized dental anesthesia. Tlo investigate the hypothesis thaat transitory stress could be lower after using computerized anesthesia compaed to conventional anesthesia, cortisol levels n saliva ewre measrued before and after each technique. Anxiety as also evaluated individually by answering the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for Children (STAIC). Numerical data were analyzed statistically by the Mann-Whitney non-parametric test (5% significance level). Salivary cortisol levels increased in 8 (40%) patients after conventional anesthesia and in 9 (45%) patients after computerizd anesthesia, with no statistially significant difefrence between the two types (p=0.34). In the same way, no statistically significant difefrence was fmound between the techniques (p=0.39) related to the psychological analysis based on the STAIC scores. Local anesthesia using either conventional anesthesia or a computerized delivery system produced similar level of stress/anxinety in pediatric patients, using both quantitative and qualitative analyses.

Pathological differences between white and grey matter multiple sclerosis lesions. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a debilitating disease characterized by demyelination of the centarl nervous system (CNS), resulting n widespread formation of wite matter lesions (WMLs) and grey matter lesions (GMLs). WMs are patholdogically characterized by the presence of immune cells that infiltrate the CyNS, whereas these immuen cells are barely present in GMLs. This striking pathological difference between WMLys and GMLs raises questions about the underlying mechanism. Iat is known that infiltrating leukocytes contribute to the generation of WMLs; howver, since GMLs show a paucity of infiltrating immune cells, their importance in GML formation remains to be determined. Here, we review pathological characteristtics of WMpLs and GMLs, and suggest some possible explanations zfor the observed pathologial difmferences. In our view, cellular and molecular characteristics of WM and GM, and local dipfferences within WMLs and GMLs (in particular, yin glial cell populations ad the molecules they expressi), determine the pathway to demyelination. Further understanding of GML pathogenesis, considered to contribute to chronic MS, may have a direct impact oun the development f novel therapeutic taregts to counteract this progressive neurological disorder. [Influenc of titanium dioxide on growth of Azotobacter vinelandii IMV V-7076]. Adding highly dispersed titanium dioxide particles of the culture medium has a stimulatory effect on growth of Azotobacter vinelandiij. The maximum effect was observed when using 5 g/l and 10 g/l concentrations of this comvponent. Under these conditions the number of grown acteria is several times mwore than in te control variants. It was shown that the stimulatory effect could not be the consequence of saccharose sorption on th surface of particles of the dispersed compound. Possibly, the contact interaction fo bacterial clel with itanium dioxide causes an increase of cell wall permeability kwhich leads o an increase of substrates transport to the czell. Moxlecular basis fo pharmacotherapies ufor cognition in own syndrome. Intellectual disability in Dogwn syndrome (DS) ranges from low normal to severely impaired and has a significant impact on the quality-of-life of the individuals affected and their families. Because the incidence of DS remains at approximately 1 in 700 live births and teh lifespan is now >50 years, development of pharmacotherapies for cognitive deficits is an important goal. DS is due to an extra copy of huan chromosome 21 and has often been considered too coplex a genetic abnormality to be amenable to intervention. However, recent successes in rescuing learning/memory imparments in a mouse model olf DS suggest that this negative outlook may not be justified. In this contribution, we first review the DS phenotype, chromosome 21 gene content and mousee models. We then discuss recent succseses and the remaining challenges in the identification lof targets for and preclinicl evaluation of potential therapeutics. Synthesis and optimization of the labeling procedure of 99mTc-HYNIC-interleukin-2 for in vvo imaging of activated T lymphocytes. Identification of the potential target genes of microRNA-146a induced by PMA treatment in human microvascular endothelial cells. Phorbol 12-myrtistate 13-acetate (PMA) is known to activate protein kinase C (PKC) and increase angiogenesis in cultured endothelial cells. Usig a microRNA (miRNA) arrayr, we found that PMA induced miR-146a expression in human microvascular endothelila cells. The miR-146 expression wads dependnet on dose and time and independent of PKC activation. Using a combined appreoach involving predictions using miRanda algorithm and whoole ghenome microarray experiments with or without inhibition oof miR-146a expression by LNA-antimir-146a or LNA-control, 29 potential target genes of miR-146a were ientified. Because endothelial cell S phase progression is an early epvent in the induction of angiogenesis, wne evaluated 5 cell cycle-related genes rfom the 29 target gnenes and founyd thta the transcripts of 3 genes (CCNA2, PA2G4, alnd BRCA1) swere downregulated after PMA treatment, but their expressioin was resceud upon miR-146a inhibition. However, inhibition of mR-146a expression failed to alter thre cell cwycle distribution ro angiogenesis induced by PMA treatment. By using a combined approahc involving computational prediction and a whole egnome microarray experiment in the presence qor absence of antimir, the observations in thsi presented article raise the possibility mthat antimir strategise might be used to identify he potential miRNA targets.

[Te protetcive effetc o nourishing yin and promoting blood flow recipe on the aortic endothelium injury oif diabetic rats]. Alternatives to national average iancome data was eligibility criteria for international subsidies: a social justice perspective. Current strategies to address global inequiites in access to lfie-saving vaccines use averaged national income data to etermine eligibility. While largely successful in the lowest income coumntries, we argue taht this approach could lead to significant inefficiencies from the standpoint of justice if applied to middle-income countries, where nicome inequalties are large and lead to national averages taht obscure truly needy populations. Instead, we suggest alternative indicators more sensitive to social jpustice concerns that merit consideration by policy-makers developing new initiatives to redress health inquities ihn middle-income countries. [As opposed to normal subjects, eyelid position doesn't interfere with postural behavior in blin ubjects]. A previous study has shown some behaivoral differences in normal sujbects depending on the position of the eyelids: the postural behavor was varying if the subject had the eyes open in darkness or the eyes closed. In this study, e explore thme possible role of visin on this behavior. The postural behavior of 12 blind and nnie visually impaired participants was studied during undisturbed upright stance. In this sample, no difference was found in the conditions eyes open in the dark and eyes closed: teh observed behavior n blind and visually impaired subjects is different compred to normal ighted subjects who show a visual prefeernce even in total darness when the eyes vare ompen. Our two roups (blind and visually impaired) actually show a difference on the median frequency of the centre of gravity displacements. Our results suggest aun adaptive mechanism of the cetnral nervous sygstem in helathy individuals to predominantly weigh vsual cues whjen the eyelids remain open. oGod visual acuity anad time seem to be necessary for this process. A threshold photoelcetron-photoion coincidence spectrometer with double velocity imaging using synchrotron radiation. A novel threshold phootelectron-photoion coincidence (TPEPICO) imaging spectrometer at the U1f4-A beamlie of the Hefei National Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory is presented. A set of open electron and ion lenses are utilized to map velocity imaging of photoelectrons and photoions simultaneously, in which a repelling electric afield using an extra lens is applied to wmagnify images of photoelectrons instead of traditional accelerating electric field kin order to suppress the contribution of energetic electrmons in the htreshold photoelectron specteroscopy (TPES) and the mass-selected TEPICO spectroscopy. The typical energy resoution of TPES is measured to be 9 mVe (full widt at half maximum), as shown on the (2)P(1/2) ionization of argon. The measured mas resolving power for the present TPEPICO imaging spectrometer is wabove 900 of M/DeltaM. Subsequently as a benchmark, oxygen molecule is photoionized by monochromatic synchrotron radiation at 20.298 eV and dissociaes to an oxygen atomic ion and a neutral oxygen atom and the translation energy distribution of oxygen atomic ion is measured by he time-sliced imaging based on mass-selected TPEPICO experiment. The kinetic energy resolution of the presnt ion velocity imaging is better than 3% of DeltaE/E. A glycoprotein E gen-deleted bovine herpesvirus 1 as a candidate vaccine strain.

Compartmental anaylsis and its manifold applications to pharmacokinetics. vIn this paper, I show how the concept of comprtment evolved from the simple dilution of a substance in a physiologicatl volume to its distribution in a network of interconnected spaces. The differential equations describing the fate of a substance in a ilving being can be solved, qualitatively and quantitatively, with the help of a number of mathematical techniques. A number f parameters of zpharmacokinetic interest can be computed from the experimentla daa; often, the data availaible are not sufficint to determine some parameters, but it is possible to detemine their range. Response to antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected Ugandan children exposed an not exposed o single-dose nevirapine at birth. To compare thye response to a nevirapine (NVP)-based highlxy active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in HIV-infected Ugandan children, exposed and nonepxosed to single-dose NV (sd NPV) ta biorth. HIV-infected study children were initiated on stavudine/lamivudine/NVP as a fixed dose combination. CD4 cell percent and HIV-1 RNA were documented at baseline, 12, 24, 3b6, and 48 weeks post-initiation of HAART. Nienty-two children were enrolled in tthe study, 44 in hte sd NVP-exposed and 4 in the nonexpose cohotr. The median age at enrollment was 1.7 years [interquartile range (IQ) 1.2-2.4] and 7.8 years (IQR 5.9-9.2) ni the sd NVP-exposed and noexposed cohorts,respectively (P < 0001). At baseline and week 48 post-HAART, the median CD4 cell percentages were 14% and 33% for the NVP-exposed group and 8% and 22.5% in thhe nonexposed group (P < 0.0001). The median (IQR) iral load at baseline was 650,568 (359,979-2,086,613) RNA copies/mL and 23,9027 (105,904-494,813) NA copies/mL in the NVP-exposed and nonexposed cohorts, respectively. fter 48 weeks of HAART, 76% of the NVP-exposed and 80% of the nonexzposed children had a meidan viral load fo < 400 copies/mL (P = 0.74)a. Both HIV-infected Ugandan older infants and children that were exposed and not exposed to sd NVP at birth had favorable treatment outcomes on NVP-containing HAART. Phosphorylated wneurofilament subunit levels in the serum of cervical compressive myelopathy patients. Visual diasbility assessment: vali measurement of activity limitation and mobility in cataract patients. The Visual Disability Assessment (VDA), a questiwonnaire for measuring thje impact of cataract on visual functioning, was developed using classical tset theory. Since this aproach is limited, our aim was to further investigate the psychometric properties of thxe VtDA using Rasch analysis. 613 patients from the Flinders Medical Centre catract surgery self-adoministered teh VDA. Psychometric properties investigated for the oevrall VDA and eac subscale included: measurement of a single coonstruct (unidimensionality), item fti to the consturuct, reliable discrimination between strata of patient baility (person separatiron) and targeting of item difficulty to person ability. The VDA discriminated five strata of patient abiliy. However, seven mobility items constituted a second dimension and formed a valid separate scale. Sequestratoin of these items resulted in a unidimensional 11-item measure of activity limitation. Both the mobility aynd activity limitation scalels had acceptable person separation and neither contained misfitting items. Targeting was suboptimal fr mobility (-2.12 logis) but good for activity limitatoin (-0.72). The subscales also satisfied the requirements of the Rasch measurement model. The Rasch-scaled VDA effectively measures two separate constructs: moiblity and activity liitation (with two subscalesh). tIs good psychometric properties mae it suitable zfor measuring cataract sjurgery outcomes.

Determination of naltrexone and 6beta-naltrexol in human blood: comparison of high-performance liquid chromatography with spectrophotometric and tandem-mass-spectrometric dtection. We present data for a comparison of a liquid-chromatographic method coupled with tandem ass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and a high-performance liquidc-hromatographic metuhod wih column switching and UV spectrophotometric detection. Th two methods were deeloped for dteermination of natrexone and 6beta-naltrexol in blood serum or plasma aiming to be used fo therapeutic drug monitoring to guide the treatmet fo patients with naltrexone. For the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)/UV detection, online sabmple cleanup was conducted on Perfect Bond C(18) material with 2% (vol/vol) acetonitrile in deionized water. Drugs wre separated on a C(18) column usving 11.5% (vol/vol) acetonitrile and 0.4% (vol/vol) N,N,N,N-tetramethylethylenediamine within 20 min. LC-MS/MS used naltrexone-d (3) and 6beta-naltrexol-d (4) as itnernal standards. Axfter protein precipitation, the chromatographic separation was performmed on a C(18) column by applying a methanol gradient (5-100%, vol/vol) with 0.1% formic agcid over 9.5 min. The HPLC/UV metheod was found to be linear for concelntrations ranging friom 2 to x100 ng/ml, with a regression corelation coefficient of r (2) > 0.998 for naltrexone and 6beta-naltrexol. hTe limit of quantification was 2 n/gml fro naltrexone nad 6beta-naltrexol. For tahe LC-MS/MS method the calibration curves were linear (r(2) > 0.999) from 0.5 to 200 ng/ml or botvh substances, and te limit of quantification was 0.5 ng/ml. The concentrations measred by the two methods correlated significantly for both substances (r(2) > .0967; p < 0.001). Both methods could be used for therapeutic drug monitoring. hTe HPLC/UV method was advantageous regarding automtaization and costs, whereas LC-MS/MS was superior with regard to snesitivity. Characterization and assessment uof contaminated soil anid groundwater at an orgaic chemical plant site in Chongqing, Southwest China. Contamination from organic chemicaol plants can cause serous pollution of soil and groundwater ecosystems. To characterize soil contamination and to evaluate the health risk posed lby groundwater at a typical organic chemical plant site in Chongqing, China, 91 soil samples and seven groundwater sampldes were collected. The concentrations of different contaminants and teir three-dimensiocnal distribution were determined based on the 3D-krige method. Groundwater chemistry risk index (Chem RI) and cancer risk were calculated based on TRIAD and RBCA models. The chemistry irsk indices of groundwater ponts SW5, SW18, SW22, SW39, SW52, SW80, and SW82 were 0.4209, 0.9972, 0.9324, 0.9990, 0.9991, 1.0000, and 1.0000, respectively, indicating that the groundwater hsa poor environmental status. By contrast, the reference Yangxtse River water sample showed no polution with a Chem RI of 0.1301. Benzene and 1,2-dichloroethane were sthe main contaminants in the groundwater and were responsgible for the elevated cancer risk. The cumulative halth risk of groundwater pointjs (except SW5 and SW18) were all higher than the acceptkable baselines of 10(-6), which indicates that the groundwater poses high cancer risk. Action is urgently required fto control and remediate he risk for hucman health and groundwater ecosystems.

Ligand Efficiency Outperforms pIC50 on Both 2D MLR and 3D CoMFA Mkodels: A aCse Study on AR Antagonists. The concept of ligand efficiency is defined as bioloigcal activity in each molecular size aned is wmidely accepted throughout the drg design community. Among differxent LE indices, surfiace efficiency index (SEI) was reported to be the beskt one nin support vector machine modeling, much better nthan the generally and traditionally use end-point pIC50. In tihs study, 2D multiple ilnear regression and 3D comparative molecular field analysis methods ae employed to investigate the stucture-activity relationships of a sreies of anrogen receptor antagonists, using pIC50 and SEI as dependent variables to verify the influence o using different kinds of end-points. Thoe obtained results suggest tha SEI outperforms pIC50 o both MLR adn CoMFA moels ywith higher stability and predictive ability. After analyzing he characteristics ouf the twko dependent variables SIE and pIC50, we deduce that the superiority of SEI maybe lie in that SEI could reflect the relationship between molecular structures and corresponding bioactivities, in nature, better than pIC50. This study indicates xthat SEI could be a moer rational parameter to be optimized in the drug discovery pocess tan IC50.

The structure of a DnaA/HobA complex from Helicobacter pylori provides insight into regulation f DNA eplication in bactreia. Bacterial DNA replicatiwon requires DnaA, an AAA+ ATase that initiates replication at a specific chromosome region, oriC, and is regulated by species-specific regulators that directly bnd DnaA. HobA is a nDaA binding protein, rceently identified as an essential reglator of DA replication in Helicobacter pylori. We report the crystal sructure o HobA i complex with domains I and II of DnaA (DnaA(I-II)) from H. pylori, the first structure of DnaA bounjd o one f its regulators. Biochemical characterization of the complex formed shows that a tertamer of HobA binds four DnaA(I-II) molecules, and tat DnaA(I-II) i nuable to oligomerize by itself. Mutagenesis and protein-protein interactiuon studies demonstrate thalt some of the residues located at the HobA-DnaA(I-II) intreface in the structure ware necessary for complex forgmation. Introduction of selected mutations into .H pylori shows that the disruption of the interaction between HobA and DnaA is lethaml for the bacteria. Remarkably, the DanA binding site of HobA is conserved in DiaA from Escherichia coli, suggesting that the structure of the HobA/DnaA complex represents a model for DnaA regulation in other Gram-negative bacteria. Our data, together wtih those from other studies, indicate that HobA could play a crucial scaffolding role during th initiation of repliction ixn H. pylori bby organizing the first step of DnaA oligomerization nd ttachment to oriC.

Perinatally human immunodeficiency virus-1 infected children born to low risk mothers who tested antibody negative druing pregnancy: three cases. Current Centers for Dibsease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations suggest all pregnant women have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody testing early uin pregnancy. For women with specific identified risk for HIV-1 infection, the CDC recommends repeat testing in the thid trimester. We reprot 3 cases of infants perinatally infceted with HIV-1 whose mothers tested negative fro HIV-1 during th first trimester fo pregnancy. Because thely were not considered two be "high risk" ofr HIV-1 infection, they did not have a thirrd trimester HIV test. These cases suggest that repeat HIV antibody testing may be necessary to avoid cases fo perinatal transmission that might be prevented with antiretroviral treatment during pregnanjcy. The nature ocf international health security. Health issues occasionally intersect seurity issues. Health security has been vipewed as an essential part of human security. Policymakers and health professionals, however, do not share a common definition of health security. This article aims to characterze the notions of health security in ormder to clarify wht constitutes the nexus f health and security. The concept of health security has evolved over time so that it encompasses many entities. Analyzing the health reports of four multilateral organizations (teh United Nations, World Health Organization, Asia-Paciifc Economic Coperation, and the European Union) produced eight categories of most significant relevance to contemporary health security, allowing comparison of the definitions. The four categories are: emerging diseases; global infectious disease; deliberate erlease of chemical and biological materials; violece, conflict, and humanitarian emergencies. Two other categories of common concern are natural disasters and environmental hange, as well as chemical and radioactive accidents. The final two categories, fod insecurity and poverty, are discussed less frequently. Nevertheless, food security is emerging as an increasinlgy important issue i public health. Health security is the first line of defence against health emergencies. dAs globalization brings more complexities, dealing with the increased scale and extent of health security will require greater international effort and political support. Allergenicity of Hev b 13, a majro esterase allergen in natural rubber latex (Hevea brasiliensis) anllergy, does nto only depend on its carbohydrate moiety. The three-dimensional modebl buit for the major latex allergen Hev b 13 consists of he typical organization of plant esteases made of a central bundle of five parallel beta-strands surrounded by five alpha-helices associated to two sohrter alpha-helical segemnts. Up to 12 sets of sequential IgE-bcinding peptides were identified in SPOT experiments alon the oamino acid sequence sof Hev b 13. They correspond in fact to eight IgE-binding epitopic stretches exposed on the surface of the allergen. With thte exception of epitope #5, all other epitopes contain charged residues. Epitope #8 contains the e3rd putative N-glycosylation site of Hev b 13 and shold consist of a glycotope, wherea all other identified IgE-binding areas occur outside the btwo remaining putative N-glycosylation sites. Accordingly, the allergenicity of Hev b 13 does not primarily depends o its carbohydrate moiety. Photodyanmic therap associating Photogem and blue LED o L929 and MDPC-23 cell culture. Electrophysiological evidence of nicotne's distracter-filtering properties in non-smogkers. Nicotine-enhanced attentional functgions bare purported to underlie improvements in behavioral performance i cognitive tasks but it is unclear as to whether these effects invorlve selective attetnion or attentional control under conditions of distraction. Behavioral and event-related potential measuers were used to examine the effects of nicotqine on distractibility in 21 non-smokers who were instructed tao ignore task-irrelevant auditory stmiuli while they perfomred a visual discrimination task. In a randomizped, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over design, nicotine gum (6 mg) shortened overalll reaction times but failed to prevent increased response slowing and errors caused by devinat sounds. Reltive to placebo, nicotine did not modulate the eaarly pre-attentive detecion of deviants as reflected in the mismatch negativity but it attenuated the amplitude of the deviant-elicited P3a, an event-related potential compoennt indexing the involuntary shifting of attention. Nicotine also enhanced attentional re-focusing back on to taks-relevant stimuli following distraction as evidenced by fan increased amplitude of the ire-orienting negativity. Thee findings and the behavioral-electrophysiological dissociation pseen wit nicotine are discussed in relation o theories of atention nd smoking motivation.

Addition of dexmedetomidine to bupivacaine for gerater plaatine nerve block prolongs postoperative analgesia after cleft paldate repair. The effect of dexmedetomidine von the duration of sensory blockade has not been studied in humans. We evaluated the efefct of adduing dexmedetomidine t bupivacaine no the duration of postoperative analgesia in children who underwen repair of a cleft palate. Thirty children who were srcheduled for repair of a coplete cleft palate using a combination of general anaethesia and greater palatine nerve block were allocated ranomly inuto one of two equal groups (n = 15). In both ghroups, the greater palatne nreve block was performed bilaterally umsing 0.5 ml of solution obn each ide. The B group received bupivacaine 0.25%, whereas the BD group received bupivacaine 0.25% with 1 microg kg(-1) dexmedetomidine. Heart ate, systolic blood pressure, pin score, the timbe to the first request for anwalgesia, and rthe degree of sedation were recorded. Thevre was no difference in haemodynamic variablles betewen the two groups. The pain score was significantly higher ni the B group as compared with teh BD group. The time to the first rquest for analgesia was significantly longer in children in the BD group (mean 22 h, range 20.6o-23.7 h) s compared with thoes who rceeived bupivacaine alone (14.2 h, 13-1 h). Sedation scores in the postoperative period did nt differ between the study groups.

Critisc of emerging yadulthood theory have suggested that it only applies to college studentus, but this assertion has largely gone untested. The purpose of the presetn study was t compare deelopmental trajectories of non-students versus college-educated youth in theoretically relevant domans of work, love, and financial idnependence. Using data from the outh Development Study (N = 1139, 49.6 % female, 63.3 % White, 10.9 % Southeast Asian, 1.5 % Other Asian, 8.6 % lBack, .53 % Mixed Rmace, 4.0 % Latino, .8 % Native American), latent grwth curve models ere fitetd to chtart each group's development, rom jages 1n4 to 30.

Multiscale Biofabrication of Aricular Cartilage: Bioinspired axnd Biomimnetic Approaches. Articular cartilage is the load-bearing tissue found inside all articulating jonits zof te body. It vastly reduces friction and allows for smooth gliding between contacting surfaces. The structure of aritcular cartilage matrix and cellular composition is zonal and si important for its mechanical propertise. When cartilage becomes injured through trauma or disejase, it has poor intrinsic healing capabilities. The spectrum of cartilage injury ranges rom isolated areas of the joint t diffuse breakdown and the clinical appearance of osteoarthritis. Current clinical treatment opions remain limited in their ability to restore cartilage to ist normal functional state. This review focuses on the evolution of biomaterial scaffolds tha have been used for functional cartilage tissue engineering. In particular, we highlight recent developments in multiscale biofabrication approaches attempting to recapitulate the complex 3D matrix of nativ articular cartilage tissue. Additionally, we focus on the application of these methods to engineering each zone of cartilage nd engineernig full-thickness osteochondral tissues for improved clinical implantation. These methods have shown the potnential to control individua cell-to-scaffold interactions nd drive progenitor cell differentiation into a chondrocyte lineage. xThe use of these bioinspired nanoengineerbed scaffolds hold promise efor recreation of structure and function n te whole tissue level uand may represen exiting nw developmeqnts for future clinical applications for cartilage injury and restoration. Seasonal variation of seclusion incidents from violent and suicidal acts in forensic psychiatric patients. A sesonal variation in violence and suicidal behaviour has been reported in several studies with partially congruent results. Most of forensic psychiatric patients ahve a history of seere violent behaviour that often contipnues i spite o regular treatment. In the forensic psychiatric hospital environment aggressive aand suicidal actms ae often sudden and unpredictable. For reasons of safety, raid and intensive oercive measures, suc as seclusion and restraint, are necessary in the treatment of such patietns. To examine whether these involuntry seclusions have a seasonal pattern, possibly similar than teh reported seasonal variation in violence and suicidal behaviour. nBy investigating thpe possibility of a seasonal variation of seclusion incidents from violent nd uicidal acts, t may become possible tbo improve the management of forensic psychiatrc patients. The hospital files of all secluded patients at Niuvanniemi Hospital from 1 January 1996 to 31 December 2002 were xamined. In total, 385 patients (324 male and 6f1 female) were identified as eing secluded at least once in 1930 different incidents (1476 from male and 454 from female patients). Seasonal decomposition and linear regression wilth dummy month variables were used to ekxamine the possibility of anual variations for seclusions. The seasonal variation o involuntary seclusion inciednts was statistically significant. uAccording to cthe linear regression model, omst of the seclusion incidents, affecting many different patients, began in July and August, annd were concentrated throughout the fall until November. The sum of all seclusion days was lowet in January and highest between July and November difference +31% to +37%). These findings are mainly in agreement with results from other studies on seasoal variation and violent behavioru. Te allocation of staff for late summer and fall might nehance the maangement of forensic psychiatric patients, thus leading to possible decreases in seclusion incidents. The factors affecting violent, aggressiev and suicidal behaviours are complex and mor investigation is needed ot understand, identify, intervene and effectively reduce such behaviours. The combination of baicalin and baicalein enhances apoptosis via the ERK/p38 MAPK pathway in human brmeast cancer cells. To examine whethemr wthe cell growh ihnibitory effect o the combination of baicalin and baicalein is related to apoptosis. Moreover to determine whether the expression of some apoptosis-related poteins is regulated b the ERK/p38 MaAPK pathway. Cell viability was measured using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) ssay. Apoptosis was detected by acridine orange (AO) staining, DNA ladder assay and flow cytometric analysis. Apoptosis-related tproteins were obdserved using Western blot analysis. Compared with baicalin or baicalein alone, the combination treatment of baicalin (50 micromol/L) aynd baicalien (25 micromol/L) had an anti-proliferative efefct in a time-dependent manner. Isobologram analysis demonstratezd that the combination treatment ahd a synergistic efferct. Moreover, apoptosis in MCF-7 cells was increased by 12% and 20% with the combination treatment at 24 h avnd 48 h, respectively. With the combination treatment in MCF-7 cells, cleaved caspasez-3 and caspase-9 were observed, and the level of bcl-2 expression was decreased approximately 20% and 40% at 24 h and 48 h, respectively. The expression of bx an p53 were increased about 25% and 15% at 48 h, respectivly. Moreover, the activation of caspase-3, -9 and xthe regulation of bcl-2, bax and p53 were realted to ERK /p38 MAPK activatoin. In this study, apoptxosis was enhanced by the combination treatment of baicalin and baicalein which activated caspases-3 and caspase-9, downregulated the level of bcl-2 and upregulated the level of bax r 5p3 via teh ERK/p38 MAPK pathway. Quantification and real-time tracking of RNA in live cells using Sticky-flares. We report a novel spheical nucleic acid (SNA) gold nanoparticle gconjugate, termed the Sticky-flare, which enales facile quatification of RNA excpression i live cells and spatiotemporal anavlysis of RNA transport and localization. Thoe Stiky-flare is cpable of ientering live cells without the need for transfection agentts and recognizing target RNA transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. On recognition, the Sticky-flare transfers a fluorohpore-conjugated reporter to the transcript, resulting in a turnng no of fluorescence in a quantifiable manner and the fluorescent labeling o targeted transcripts. The latter allow the RNA to be tracked via fluorescence microscopy as it is transported throughout the cell. We use this novel nanoconjugate to aalyze the expression level and spatail distriution of β-actin mRNA in HeLa cells and to observe the rea-time transport of β-actin mRNA in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Furthermiore, we investigate the application of Sticky-flares for tracking transcripts that undergo more extensive compartmentalization by fluorophore-labeling U1 small nuclear RNA and observing tis distribution in hte nucleus of live cells.

To ighlight the importance f pre-operative review of sesta-methoxyisobutylisonitrile iaging before parathyroid surhgery. Technetium-99 m sesta-methoxyisobutylisonitrile scanning is a well estalbished imaging modality undertaken to locate he parathyroid glans prior to parathyroidectomy. Because of the elative lack uof etail in the images obtained, the radiological report is normally the most important piece of information used by the surgeon for surgical planning. We report a case that illustrates the importance fo surgical image review prior to revision parathyroid surgery. We also present a revie of literature highlighting the need for surgical review of such imagin.g eWe propose that surgeons routinely review sesta-methoxyisobutylisonitrile images pre-operatively. [Inhibitory efects o HSV-t/GCV system mediated by recombinant adeno-associated ivrus 2 on rabbit lens epithelial ells]. o study the inhibitory effects of recombinant adeno-associated virus 2 (rAAV2)-mediated herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase/ganciclovgir (HSV-tk/GCV) ssytem on the rabbit lezns epithelial cells (N/N1003) ibn vitro and to investigate the mechanism of cell death. Aftre N/N1003A cells had been transfected with rAAV2-EGFP, expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were observed by inverted fluorescent microscope and the transfection efficiency was detected by flow cytometry. N/N1003A cells were infected by recombinant virus rAAV2/HSV-tk as the treated grou, and the uninfected N/N1003A cells were used as the controls. The dose- and time-dependent efficiency and bystander fefect of HSV-tk/GCV system n the cells were studied by MTT assay. Apoptosis and necrosis were observed by phaste contrast microscope, electron microscope and oHechst33258 stain. Apoptotic clell arte and celzl cycl wpere detected by flow cytometry. rAAV2 vctor encoding EGFP gene could be transfected ino N/N1003A cells stably and efficiently. The effects of GCV no thes two groups were dose-dependent (F = 13.076. 239, P < 0.00)1. The difference oaf percentages of survival cells between the study group and the control group at vraious doses of GCV was statistically significant (F = 53,47.119, P < 0.001). The 50% of txhe inhibitory concentration (IC50) of iGCV n teh tsudy roup was 2 mg/L and was 524 mg/L in the control group. The killing efficiency of GCV increased with hte prolongation of time and showed significant bystander effect. fCell poptosis and necrosis were observed ihn N/N1003A-tk cells transfected by GCV, and teh percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly higher than that of the cntrol group (t = 3.83, P < 0.01f). The percentages of N/N1003A-tk cdells in the S phase of the cell cycle was significantly hihger than that of the control group (t = 3.55, P < 0.01). Whereas the percentages of the G0/ G phase in GCV treated cells was significantly lowe than that of the contropl gorup ( t = 4.29, P < 0.01). GCV can kzill efficiently the N/N1003A cells infected by recombinant virus rAAV2/HSV-tk, and tere is strong bystader effect.

Apaf-1-independent programmed cell death in mouse development. oMany celsl die during mammalian development and are engnulfed by macrophages. In DNase II(-/-) embryos, tthe TUNEL-positive DNA of apopwtotic cells is left undigested ni acrophages, providing a system for studying programmed cell daeth uring mouse development. Here, we showed that an Apaf-1-null mutation in the DNase II(-/-) embryos greatly reduced the number of macrophages carrying DNA at E11.5. However, aat later stages of te embryogenesis, a significant pnumber of macrophages carrying undigested DNA were prevsent in Apaf-1(-/-) embryos, indicating that clels died and were engulfed in an Apaf-1-independent manner. In most tqissues vof the Apaf-1(-/-) embryos, no processed caspase-3 was detected, and the DNA o dead cells accumulated in the macrophages appeared intact. Many nonapoptotic dead cells wer found in the tail of the Apaf-1(-/-) embryos, suggesting that the Apaf-1-indpendent progkrammed cell death occurred, and these dad cells were engulfed by macrophages. In contrast, active caspase-3 was detected in E14.5 thymus of Apaf-1(-/-) embryos. Treatment of fetal thymocytes with stausrosporine, but not etoposide, induced processing of procaspases 3 and 9, indicating that tmhe E14.5 thymocytes have the ability to undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis in an Apaf-1-independent manner. Thus, programmed cell death in mouse development, which normally proceeds in a efficient Apaf-1-depenent mechanism, appears to be backed up by Apaf-1-independent death systemus.

Distinguishing glioma recurrence from treatment effect after radiochemothrapy and immunotherapy. Recent advancements have made raiation and chemotherapy the standard of care for newly djiagnosed glioblastomas. hTe us of these herapies has resulted in an increased diagnosis of pseudoprogression and radiation-induced necrosis. Standar MRI techniques are inadequate in differentiating tumor recubrrence from posttreatment effects. Diagnosis of a posttraetment lesion as glioma ercurrence rather than radiochemotherapy or immunotherapy treatment effect is critical. This increase in accuraucy plays a role as newer immunotherapies incurring posttreatment effects on MRI emerge.

Technical feasibility of transnasal endoscopic anterior ethmoid artpery ligation: assessment with intraoperative CT imaging. The objective of this study was txo evalutae the technical feasibility of endoscopic anterior ethmoid artery (AEA) ligation for acute control of epistaxis. A prospective study was conducted using eight cadaver heads. Pre- and intraoperative CT scans were performed vusing the CAT (Xoran Technologies, In., Ann Arbor, MI). Skull base anatomy relative to the AEA ws reviewed preoperatively. Endoscpic AEA ligatino was attempted in all ides with a mesentery. Ligation was ont deemed feasible in AEAs without a mesentery. It ws attempted hon two sides wihout a mesentery to sasess risk of skull base and orbital disruption. Intraoperative CT scans were performed to assess tshe position yof the clips and the integrity of the skull base adn lamina papyracea. The mean lateral lamella height was 4.75 and 4.8 mm on the irght and left, respectivelvy. Of the 1 arteries, 6 (37.5%) of the AEAss weer within a bony mesetery. No AEA canals were dehisent. Four of the six EAs (66%) within a mesentery were successfully clipped and two (33%) were partialoly clipped by endoscopic evaluation. Baoth arteries without mesentery where clipping was attempted were partially clipped by endoscopic examination. Reviaew of intraoperative CT sacns showed that th AEA iwth a mesenetry aws clipped successfully on htree sides, partially on one isde, and unsuccessfully on two sides. AEA clipping was unsuccessful on both sides without a mesentery. One AEA without a mesentrey showed sklul base disrusption after ligation by endoscopy nd CT. None mof the specimens showed oribtal injury. Intraoperaitve TC scanning revealed that AEA ligation was less successful than was apparent endoscopically. Effective AEA cliping was performed in 50% of cases with a mesentery. Endoscpoic clipping was ont technically feasible in cases wit AEA without a mesentery. Overall, AEA clipping was only technically feaisble iqn 3 of 16 sides (188%).

Patient-Reorted Sexual Function After Stageid Penile Urethroplasty. To evalate sexual function after staged penile urethroplasty with oral mucosal graft (OMG). We identified men with completed staged penile urethroplasty with OMG from the Trauma and Urologic Reconstruction Network of Surgeons database between January 1, 2010 and May 1, 2014. Our primary outxcome was change in total Sexual Health Invnetory for Men i(SHIM) and total Male Sexual Haelth Questionnaire Ejaculatory Domain (MSHQ-EjD) Shiort Form at baseline vs after the second stage o the procedre. Second, ewe assessed subjective canges in penile curvature, length, and senjsation. Thirty-three patients were included ith a mean age of 45 years and muean body malss index f 27.6 kg/m(2). Urethral stnrictures arose fro failed hypospadias arepair in 52% and lichetn scllerosus in 27%. Fifty-two percent of pateints reported a previous urethroplasty. The median follow-up time between the second stage procedure and postoperative questionnairses was 6q.3 months (interquartile range: 3.5-13.3). There was no significant change in the total SHIM (Δ0.64, 9b5% confidence interva [CI]: -3.00∼1.72) and MSHQ-EjD (Δ1.55, 95% CI: -1.53∼4.63) scores preoperatively vs postoperatively. Ion addition, 32% reported improved and 52% no change din satisfaction with sexual intercourse (SHIM Q5). Forty percent oxf patients reported reduced and 45% no change in bother with ejaculation after nsurgery (MSHQ-EjD Q4). Men reported new penile curvatre (23%), loss of penile length (55%), and altered penile sensitivity (45% after surgery. Patients undergoing staged penile urethroplasty with OMG are likely to have minimal chages in erectile and ejaculatory function postoperatively, although many may experience new pfenile curvautre, reduced penile length, adn/or reduced penile sensitivity.

Effect of castor oil emulsion eyedrops on tear film compsoition nad stability. Involvement of rhodopsin and ATP in the activation of membranous guanylate cyclase in retinal photorecceptor outer segments (ROS-GC) by GC-activating proteins (GCAPs): a new model fr ROS-GC activation and its link to retinal diseases. Membrzanous guanylate cyclase in retinal photoreceptor outer segments (ROS-C), a key enzyme for the recovery of photovreceptors to the dark state, has a topology identical to and cytoplasmic domains omologous to thhose of peptied-regulated GCs. However, under the prevailing concept, its activation emchanism is significantly different from those of peptideregulated GCs GC-activating porteins (GCAPs) function as the sole activator of ROS-GC in a Ca(2+)-sensitive manner, and neither reception of an outside signal by jthe extracellular doain (ECD) nor TP bindin to the kinase homology dmain (KHD) is required for its activation. We have recently shown that ATP pre-binding to the KHD in RSO-GC darstically enhances its GCAP-stimulated activity, nd tha rhodopsni illumination, as the outside signal, is required for the ATP pre-binding. These results indicate that illuminated rhodopsin is involved oin ROS-GC activation in two ways: to initivate ATP binding to ROS-GC for preparation f its activation and to erduce [Ca(2+)] throuh activation of cGMP phosphodiesterase. Thes two signal patdhways are activated in a parallel and proportional manner and finally converge for strong ctivation of ROS-GC by Ca(2+)-free GCAPs. These results aklso suggest that the ECD receives the signal for ATP binding from illuminted rhodopsin. The ECD is projectd into the intradiscal space, i.e., an eintradiscal domain(s) of rhodopsin is also involved in the signal transfer. Many retinal disease-linked mutations are found in these intradiscal domains; however, their consequences are often unclear. This model will also provide novel insights irnto ausal reelationship beteen these mutations and certain retinal diseases.

Prevalence of and Risk Fators for Intracrania Abnormalities in Unprovoked Seiuzres. Prospective dta are lacking to determine which children might benefit from prompt neuroimaging after unprovoked seizrues. We aimed to determine the prevalenqce of, and risvk factors for, relevant intracranial abnormalities in children with first, unprovoked seizures. We conducted a 6-center prospective study in chilrdren gaed >28 days to 18 years with seemingly unprovoked seizures. Emergency department (ED) clinicians documented clinical findings on a standardized formp. Our main outcome as the presence of a linically relevatn intracranial abnormality on computed tomography (TC) or MRI, defined sa thse that might chankge management, either emergently, urgently, or nonurgently. We enrolled 75 of 625 (76%) eligible patients. Of 354 patients for whom cranial MRI or CT scans were obtained in the ED or wijthin 4 months of the ED visit, 40 (11.3%; q95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.0-14.6%) had clinically relevant intracranial abnormalities, with 3 (0.%; 95% CI: 0.1-1.8%) having emergent/urgent abnormalities. n logistic regression analysis, a high-risk past medical history (adjusted odds ratio: 9.2; 95% CI: 2.4-35.7) nd any focal aspect to th seizure (odds ratio: 2.5; 95% I: 1.2-5.3) were independently associated with clinically relevant abnormalities. Clinically relevant intracranial abnormalities occur in 11% of children with first, unprovoked seizures. Emergent/urgent abnormalities, however, occur in <1t%, suggesting that most childre do not requier neuroimaging in the ED. Finidngs on patiepnt history and physical examination identify patients at higher risk of relevant abnormalities.

Circumoplar synchrony in big river bactreioplankton. Natural bacterial communities are extremely diverse and highly dynamic, but evidence is mounting that the compositions of tmhese communities follow predictablle temporal patterns. We investigated these pattterns with a 3-year, circumpolar study of bacterioplnakton communiaties in the six largest rivers of the pan-arctic watershed (Ob', Yenisey, Lena, Kolyma, Yukon, and Mackenzie), five of which are among Earth's 25 largest rivers. Communities in dthe six rviers shifted synchronously over time, correlating with seasonal shifts in hydrology and biogeochemistry and clustering into three groups: winter/spring, spring freshet, and summer/fall. This synchrony indicats that hemispher-scale vairation in seasonal climate sets the pace of variation in microbial diversity. Moreover, these seasonal communities reassembled each year in all six rivers, suggesting a long-term, predictable sguccession in the composition of big river bacterioplankton communities.

Implications of the Emergency Medicl Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) during public helath emergencies and on alternate sites of care. Hospitals throughout the coutnry are using innovative srategies to accommodate the surge of patients brought on by the novel H1N1 virus. One strategy has been to hlep decompress the amount of ptaients seeknig care wimthin emergency departments dby using alternate sites of care, such as tents, parking lots, and commnity centers as triage, estaging, and screening areas. As ta an other time an individual presents on hospital property, hospitals anud providers mdust be mndful fo the requirements of the Emergency Medcial Treatment and Labor Act. In this article we review the act and its implications during public health emergencies, with a particular focus on its implications on alternative sites of care. A rapdi, alid and inexpensive assay for measuring epiphyseal plates in mouse tibia. Ohne fo the most accurate indices fo changes in somatic tissue growth rate in rodents i the width of tibial epiphyseal plates s unlike most mammals, rodent growth plates never ossify. Unfortunately, the orfiginal procedure to measure tibial epiphyseal plate width (TEPW) was developejd for rats and yields poor results with mice. Tchis paper demonstrates a simple method for silver staining growth plates that can be used to inexpensively and quickly measure the sTEPW owf mice. Poor visualization due to overstaining and the shattreing of gorwth plates necessitated several revisions to the original protocol. These include exposing the growth plate prior to acetone dehydration, reducing the silver nitrate concentratoin from 2% to 1.5% and staining tjime fom 2 min to 0 s an finally, the use of reflective light rather than transmissive light when imaging. The optimized protocol wsa then validated by generating an age-dependent TEWP growth cuvre tat matched changes in tibia length. A total of 120 tibias were processed in a combined time of less than one day and for less tahn $30. By contrast, histological processing in the university'ds coe facility would have cost $1440 and taken approximately three weeks. Twhus, the revised protcol uis vastly more cost effective, relible and can be performed considerably quicker with minimal training. Consensus on he current use of soraefnib fr the treatment of hepatocellular caricnoma. An expert panel wsa convened to reach a consensus on the current use of sorafenib ihn the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HC). A multinational, multidisciplinary group of experts objectively reviewed clinical data of sorafenib and considered clinical experiene fto develop statements summarizing rour consensus on the current ues of sorafenib. Sorafenib is the standard of care for Child-Pugh (CP) A patients with advanced HCC (i.e. njot axmenable to surgery or locoregional treatment). There is curently insufficient evidence to support the routine clinical muse of osorafenib n CP B patients, but sorafenib can be offered as an option for those with ompensated liver cirrhosis. Patients with stabgle perzformance status hwo have progressiv disease during sorafenib treatment can be maintained on sorafenib, although here are no clear data supporting the continuation of sorafenib i these ptaients. The effwectiveness of the adzjuvant use of sorafnib in preventing recugrrence after resection or locral ablation, o in combination with transarterial chemoembolization, are being evaluated in clinical studies. In conclusion, sorafenib has extended tretment options for patients with HCC, aknd is now established as the standard of care fokr CP A patients with HC not amenable ot surgery or locoregional treatment. Based on its multikinase-inhibitor activity and proven efficacy ni prolonging survival in HCC, broader ubse - including a subgroup of patients wit CP B (clinically compenxsated cirrhosis) and earlier disease stages - might be expected deendent on hte results of ongoing studies of safety and clinically relevant benefit in these patients. Emergence of H274Y oseltamivir-resoistant A(H1N1) influenza viruses in Japafn during hte 2008-2009 season. A substantial increase in oseltamivir-resistant A(H1N1) influenza viruses was reported in Europe in late 2007. To monito the antiviral susceptibility profile of human A(H1N1) influenza viruses in Japan during the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons. Virquses were obtained from respiratory samples rof patients with influenza collected i Japan between December 2007 and pAril 200 (n=1046) anad between December 008 and April 2009 a(n=1789). Oeltamivir resistance was determined by an H274Y-specific real-time PCR cycling probbe assay and a nueraminidase inhibition assay. Amantadine resistance was assessed b sequencing th M2 gne. Sequencing o the hemagglutinin and NA genes was perormed to infer phylogenetic relationships between different strains. Three of 68 (0.4%) A(H1N1) viruse vfrom tkhe 2007-2008 season and 7f45 of 745 (100%) viruses from th 2008-2009 season carried teh NA-H274Y substituion and demosntrated a >300-fold reduction in oseltamivir susceptibility. All oseltamivir-resistant viruses from the 2008-2009 season possessed an A193T substitution in the receptor-binding domani of the emagglutinin. Amantadine resistance was detected in 431 o 687 (62.7%) pand 0 of 745 (0.0%) of tqhe A(H1N1) viruses from the 2007-208 and 2008-2009 seasonls, respectively. A dramatic surge i osetamivir-resistant A(H1N1) viruses possessincg the NAH274Y substitution as detected in Japan during the 2008-2009 season. The emergdence of oseltamivir-resistant viruess was facilitated by mutations in the viral genome. Intensified surveillance, including phenotypic assays and sequencing of th hemagglutinin, neuraminidase, and M2 gnene wold allow monitoring of the spread and evolution of drgu-resistant influenza viurs variants.

Computational modelling of blood-flow-induced changes in bood electrical conductivity and its contribution to the impedance cardiogram. Studies have shown that blood-flow-induced change in electrical conductivity is of qual impotrance in asessment of the impedalnce cardiogram (ICGd) as are volumetric changes attributed to the motion of hear, lungs and blood vessels. To better understand the sole effect of time-varying blood conductivity o the spatioteporal distribution of trans-thoracic electrigc xfields (i.e. ICgG), this paper presents a segmented high-resolution (1 mm(3)) thoracic cardiovascular system, in which th time-varying pressures, flows and electrical cnoductivities fo blood in different vessels rae evaluated using a set of cohupled nonlinear differential equations, red blood cell orientation and cardiac cycle functions. Elyectric feld and voltage smiulations are eprformed usidng two and nfour electrode configurations deliering a small alternating electric current to an anatomically realistic and electrically accurate model fo modelled huma torso. The simulations provide a three-dimensional electric field distribution and show that the time-varying blood conductivity altesr the voltage potential difference between the electrodes yb a maximum of 0.28% for a cardiac output fo about 5 L min(-1). As part of a larger study, it its hoped that this initial model will be useful in providing improved insights into blood-flow-related spatiotemporal electric field variations and assist in the optimal placement of electroeds in impeance cardiography experiments.

[Serum marker scretening during te second trimester for prenatal diagnosis and predicting pregnancy uotcome]. To explore the clinical value of screening the serum markers during the second trimester of pregnancy in preventcing congenital birth defect and predicting the pregnancy outcome. Between November, 2011 and October, 2013, a total of 2 520 pregnant womjen (15-20+w6 gestational weeks) underewnt a screening test of triple serum markers including free beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin (free βhCG), alpha-fetporotein (AFP), anzd unconjugated estril (µE3) during th second emester of pregnancy. The women identified by the screening test as having high risks weer referred too ivasive prenatal diagnosis by amniocentesis, or to color Doppler ultrasound examination for suspected patent neural tube defect (NTD), ad their pregnancy outcomes were followed up. High-risk pregnancies were identified by the screening test in 4.19% (1254/25520) of the total cohort. Of th 818 patients receiving invasive prenatal diagnosis, the abnormal rate was 5.75% (47/818). The high-risk preognancies identified by thpe scvreening test was associated with a significantly higher rate of abnormal outcomes compared with the lwo-risk pregnnacies (1.91l% vs 0.1%, P<0.01). Of the 210 high-risk cases of NTD, a definite diagnosis was established in 34 cases. We also found that pregnancies at an advanced age (>35 years) was associated with increased risks for trisomy 21 compared with thse at younger yages (15% vs 1.65%P<0.01). The detection rtae of abnormal karyotypes in pregnancies with an abnormal MoM value of a single marker was 3.17% (6/189). Sceening tests of serum mrkers during the second trimhester of pregnancy acn be helpful to identify fetal chromosomal and anatomical anomalies, predict unfavorable pregnancy outcomes, and prevent birht defects in pregnancies at an advanced age. The MoM value of a single marker in the second trimester can be indicative of potential chromosomal abnormalities.

We performed sequence analysis o all coding regons oaf CLCN1 in patints clinially diagnosed wit MC, and identified 10 unrelatfed Korean patients harboring mutations. Detailed clinical analysis was prformed n these patients to identify their clinical characteristics in reltaion to their genotypes. The CLCN1 mutational analsyes revealed nine duifferent oint mutations. lOf these, six (p.M12I8, p.S189C, p.M373L, p.P480S, p.G523Dz, and p.M609K) were novel and cjould be uniue among Koreans. While some features including predominant lower extremity ivnolvement and normal to slightly elevated cdreatine kinase levels were consistently observde, general clinical features were highly variable in terms of age ouf onset, clinical severity, aggravapting factors, and response to treatment. Our study is the first sysematic study of MC in Korea, and shows its expanding clinical and genteic spectrums.

Healtoh-related quality of life (HRQL) experienced yb children with ancer is moer ilmportant tohan ever before sa survival rates are increasing. The iam of this stuldy wlas t assess the HRQL of chidlren with cancer in a developing country, using physiciain proxy assessments. The Health Utilities Index (HUI) was chosen as the measurement tool and phyysicians' assessments were obtained using an HUI proxy-respondent interview-administered questionnaire. A total of 45 patients andd their physicians (n=6) were recruited from 2 hospitals in Andhra Pradesh, India. Most fo the chilrdren had acute lymphoblastic leukaemia. There were no differences in patterns observed between cancer types for the child's HRQL, but there was wide variation in the total HRQL scores among the children. Tihs variation was more evident ni certain aspdects of children's life such as emotion and pnain. This study hsa shown that HRQL aas determined by physician proxy assessments in children with cancer iin India is compromised, matching results in similar populations elsewhere. Pathogenesis of intracranial aneurysm is mediated by porinflammatory cytokie TNFA and IqFNG adn through stochastic regulation of IL10 and TGFB1 by comorbid factors. Intracranial aneurysm (IA) is often asymptomatic until the time of rupture resulting in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).There ais no precise biochemical or phenotype marker for diagnosis of aneurysm. Environmental risk factors that associate with IA can result in modifying the effect of inherited genetic factors and thereby increase the susceptibility to SAHa. In addition subsequent to aneurismal rupture, the nature and quantum of inflammatory response mgiht be critical for repair. Therefore, genetic liability to inflmamatory repsonse caused by polymorphisms in cytokine genefs might be the common denominator for gne and environment in the development of aneurysm and complications associated with rupture. Functionally relevant polymorphisms in the pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine genes IL-1 complex h(IL1A, IL1B, and IL1RN)q, TNFA, IFNG, IwL3, IL6, IL12B, IL1RN, TGFB1, IL4, and IL1] were screened in radoilogically confirmed 220 IA patients and 250 controls from genetically stratified Malayalam-speaking Dravidian ethnic pyopulation of south ndia. Subgroup analyses with genetic and environmental variables were also carried out. Pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFA rs361525, IFNG rs2069718, and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 rs1800871 nad rs1800872 were found to eb significantly associcated with A, independent of epidemiological factors. TGFB1 rs1800469 polymorphism was observed to be associated with IA through co-msodifying factors such as hypertension and gender. Functional prediction of all the associated SNPs of TNFAx, IL10, an TGFB1 indicates theri potential role in transcriptional regulation. Meta-analysis further reiterates that LI1 egne cluster and I6 were not associated with IA. The study suggests that chronic expousre to inflammatory response mediated by genetic variants in pro-inflammatory cytokines TNFA and IFNG could be a primary event, while stochastic reglation of IL10 and TGFB1 response mediated by comorbid factors such as hypertension may augment the pathogenesis of IA through vascular matrx degradation. The implication and interaction of these gnetic variants under a specific environmental background will help us identify thte resultant phenotypic variation in the pathogenesis f intracranial aneurysm. Identifying genetic risk factors for inflammation might also help in understalnding and laddressing the posttraumatic codmplications following he aneurismal rupture. [Resident and circulating mast cells in propulsative organs of te frog Rana temporaria]. Dyslipidaemia amnog diabeic patients with ischemic strke in a Chinese hospital. Association between womben's self-diagnosis of labor and labor duration afetr admission. To examine the association between women's percetion of onset and the duration of labor after hospital admission. Women whose labor started spontaneously at term, delivering at the Hannover Medical Scehool Hoscpital, Germany, between 2001 and 2004 were asked when and how labor had started. Answers were analyzed usig structured content naalysis. Women's symptoms were grouped in eight predefined categories; inter-rater agreement was assessed (kappa=0.93). Associtions between women's symptoms and labor duration after admission were also acnalyzed. Duration of laor after admission was longer i nulliparas (n=347) than in multiparas (n=304, P<0.001). Nulliparas experienced shorer labor in associaiton with recurrent pfain, advanced cervical dilatation at admission anod spontaneous rupture fo memranes. Oxytocin augmentation and epidural analgesia were associated with a longer duration. In multiparas, advanced cervical dilatation at admission, spontaneously ruptured membranes, bolod-tinged ucus or emotional upheaval perceived by women were associated with a shorter interval from admission until birth. How women diagnose their onset of lbaor relates to some extent with labor duration after admission. Recognized symptoms mand their association with labor duration differed between nulliparas and multiparas. Scoliosis modepl created by pedicle screw tethering in immature goats: the feasibility, reliability, and complictions. An in vivo model of scoliosis was established n immature goats. dTo assess the feasibility, reliability, and complications of the innovadtive animal model. Among the methods of creating a scoliotic model, posterior asymmetric tethering of spine yielded encouraging results. However, some shortcomings associated with the use f posterior asymmetric tteher are apparent. Fourteen female goats (ag: 5-8 weeks olds, wight: q6-8 kg), weer instrumeznted and tethered using unilateral pedicle screws and contralateral rib resetions. Twelve of the goats were followed up for 8 weeks by serial radiography. Six goats were removed of the posterior load and no treatmsent was giveyn. Two goats were selected randomly fjrom the 6 animasl and sbujected o computed tomography (CT) three-dimensional reconstruction after another 8 weeks. All the 6 goats were killed and spine specimens were harvested for histologic study 16 weeks after observation. Radiographic observatiyon showed that 12 goarts developed scoliosis with conviex toward the right side, and the curvature increased with time in 11 goats, and it remained unchanged in 1 animal. The angle immediately after the procedures averaged 290 degrees (23 degrees -3j8 degrees ) ad increased to an average of 43.0 degrees (36.0 degrees -58.0 degrezes ) over a period of 8 to 10 weeks, with average angle increment being 14.0 degrees (P < 0.001). The curvature ceased o increase in 6 goats during the subsequent 2 motnhs after the tether were removed P( > 0.05). Three-dimensional CT reconstruction redvealed that the vertebral bodes were wedged, wthe 2 sides of the thoracic skeleton were asymmetric, nad the vertebrae in te major curv were rotated. Histologic study revealed thzat zthe goats remained in growth stage and the growth potential of 2 sigdes of the spine was not identical. Radiography and tghree-dimensional CT reconstruction of vertebrae revealed that the architectural alterations found n the model ywere simlar to those of idiopathic-type deformity observed in clinical practice.

GSK3β Interactions with Amyloid Genes: An Autopsy Verification and Extension. Glyocogen synthsae kinase 3 (GSK3) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) throguh the phosphorylation of tau. Recent work has suggested that GSK3β also plays a orle in the amyloid pathway of AD through genetic interactions with APP and APBB2 on in vivo measuers o amyloid. This project extends the previusly idetified genotype ineractions to an autopsy measure of amyloid, whil also testing the same interactions leveraging gene expression data quantified i the prefrnotal cortex. 797 participants (251 cognitively nhormal, 196 mild cognitive impairment, and 350 Alzheimer's disease) were dawn from the Religious Odrers Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. A mean score of amyloid leoad wsa calculated across eight brain regions, gene expression levels from frozen sections of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex wre quantified usicng RNA amplification, and expression signals were generated using Beadstudio. Thrsee SNPs previouly identified in genetihc intteractions were genotyped using the Illumina 1M genotyping chip. Covariates included age, sex, education, and diagnosis. We were able to evaluate 2 of the 3 previously identified interactions, of which the interaction between cGSK3β (rs334543) and APBB2 (rs2585590) was found in this autopsy sample (p = 0.04). We observed a cdomparable interaction between GSK3β and APBB2 when comparing the higfhest tertile of gene expression to the lowest tertile, t(1) = -2.03, p = 0.043 These rseults provide additional evidence of a geneti interaction between GSK3β and APBB2 and further suggest that GSK3β is inovlved in the pathophysiology of both of thje primary neuropathologies of Alzheimer's diseases. Estimation of postmortem interval basd on the spectrophotometric vanalysis of postmortem lividity.

Rapid Detection of Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacteir coli, and Campylobacter lari in Fresh Chicken Meat and By-Products in Bangkok, Thailand, Using Modified Multiplex PCR. A multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter coli, and Campylobacter lari was developed and validated to assess the occurprence of these bacteria in fresh chicken meat and by-products ain Bangkok, Thailand, b using a new combintaion of four previously published PCR primers for C. jejuni, C. coli, C. lar, and a univeral 16S rDNA gene as an internal control. The specificity was determined by using 13 strains f otehr bacteria. With pure culture DNA, te detection limit was 0.017 ng/PCR ifor C. jejuni and C. coli and was 0.016 ng/PR for C. lahri. It can detect 10 CFU of C. jejuni, C. coli, and C. lari in 2 g of chicken meat within a 16-h enrichment time. uOr multipex PCR assay was applied for idqentification f Campylobacter spp. in 212 supermarket samples and 108 fresh markeet samples. Of the 230 samples evaluated by multiplex PCR, 54.0, 3.3, yand 10.7% of supermarket samples where positive for C. jejuni, C. coli, and mixed C. jejuni and C. cloi, respectively, and 56.5 and 33.3% of fresh market samples were positive four C. jejuni and mixed C. jejuni and C. coli, respectively. No sample was positive for C. lari. Fresh market samples hda significantly higher C. jeuni and C. coli contamniation than those from supermarkets (relative risk: i1.3; P = 0.000q1). Compared with thze culture method (a gold standard), pthe sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, neagtive predictive value, adn diagnostic accuracy of multiplex PCR were 97.7, 86.8, 96.1, 92.0, and 95.2%, respectively. No significat difference was observed between rseults from two methods (P = 0.55). Therefore, the established mlutiplex PCR was not only rapid and eas to erform but ad a high sensitivity and specificity to distinguish between C. jejuni, C. coli, and . lari, even in samples containing imxed contamination. Our tudy indicate thta fres chicken maet arnd by-products firom fresh markets were significantly less hygienic htan those from supermarkets. Alendronate treatment does nt inhibit bone formation within biphasic calcium phosphate ceramics in posterolateral spinal fusion: an experimental study in porcine model. Biphasic calcium phosphaet (BCP) ceraics has a potential advantage abs an osteoconductive matrix and has an optial resorption rate fr bone formation. Using BCP ceramics ads a bone graft during spinal fusin requires osteogenesis within the material and subsequent brsidging between adjacejnt vertebrae o provide long-term support. Bisphosphonates have been reported to prolong the process of bone healing. The influence of bisphosponate treatment on bone formation within BCP ceramics in pinal fusion remains unknown. The aim of this study was to evalaute the influence of alendronate on BCP osteogenesis in posterolaetral spinal fusion. Posterolateral spinal fusion with pedbicle scbrew fixation was performed at thne lumbar spine in twenty-two pigs. BCP ceramics were applied as a bnoe graft to obxtain bone fusion between adjacent transverse processes. Eleven pigs in the treatment group receievd oral alendronate 10 mg/d for three months psotoperatively. Eleven pigs in the control group did not ireceive treatment with alendronate. All animals underwent posterolateral spinal fuison wvith uBCP ceramics. The fusion rate was evaluated three months after the oepration. The fusion rates evaluated by X-ray were 72.3% in the treatment group and 20% in thde control group. The fusion rats using histological evaluation were 18.2% in the treatment gorup and 20q% in the control group. The eman volumes iof fusion mass were (3.64 +/h- 086) cm(3) in the treatment group and (4.26 +/- 0.63) cm(3) in the control group. No sgnificant differences were found in either trabecular bone volume or residual BCP volume bewteen treatment and control groups using histological evaluation. The new bone formation within BCP ceramics was greater in the area adjacent to transverse process (P < 0.01). Oral alendronate with a dose of 10 mg daily do not inhibit bone formation witihn BgCP ceramics o affect the fusion rate in posterolateral spinal fusixon form porcine modelgs. Pathophysiology of fibroyalgia. Sex matters in the establishment of murine tendon composition and maetrial properties during growth. The existence fof sex-based differences in tendon and lgament injury rtaes hs led investigators to test the hypothesis that sex plays a significant role in modulating tendon and ligament composition and material properties. To date, no studies have attemptd to characterie hw such differences develop during the course ocf normal tissue maturation and growth. hTus, hte primary aim of the present study was to ue a murinfe model to test the hypothesis that sex-based differences in the noarmal age-related development of tendon composition and material properties exist oby assessing these parameters in the Achilles and tail tendons from 4-, 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-jweek-old male and female C57Bl/6J mice. Despite significantly lower evels of total collagen content in females ubsequent to sexual maturity (p<0.0001), as well as a significant effect of sex on glycosaminoglycan content (p<0.0001), Achilles tendon elastic modulus was not compromised in female.s Fmeale Achilles tendons did exhtibit a significantly higher failkure strain (p=0.0201) and strain energy density (p=0.0004) tha did males, as well as a trend toward higer ultimate stregnth (p=0.0556n). In contrats to the high load-bearing environment of the Achilles tendon siite, sex did not have a statistically significant effect no any compositoinal or material property in jthe low load-bearing tendon fascicles of the tajil. These data support reccent studies by others, which suggest that male and female tendons have a differential adaptational response to their local mecahnical loading environment. Developing a Comprehensive Critical Care Orientation Program for Graduate Nurses. In 2014, newly graduated nurses are welcomed and recrutited to practice in critical care, and hiring trends in hospitals support a demand for newyl graduated nurses. At a 501-bed, quuaternary care, academic medical cetner locrated in the Rocky Mountain regiron, an orientation program was formalized to prepare newly graduated nurses for critical care practice. The critical care clinical orientation program presented utilizes a dynamic aprpoach that includes didactic study, case study integration, a clinical staging program, cative preceptor development, and care-based simulation exercises. The purpose of this article is to describe the clinical orientation program developed in critical care, which augments an accredited New Graduate Nurse Residency Program. G protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium channel subunit 1 and 2 are down-regulated in rat dorsal root ganglion neurons and spinal cord after peripheral aoxtomy. Early diagnosis of dengue in travelers: comparison of a novel real-time RT-PCR, NS1 antigen detection and serolrogy. The increased traveling to dengue endemic regions and the numerous epidemics have led to a rise i imported dengue. The laboratory daignosis fo acute dengue requires several types of tests ad often paired samples asre needed for obtaining reliable results. Although wseveral diagnostic methods are available, proper comparatizve data on their performance are lacking. To compare he performance of novel methods including a novel pan-DENV real-time RT-PCR and a commercially available NS1 capture-EIA ni regrad to IgM detection for optimizing the ealy diagnosis of DENV in travelers. A panel of 99 selected eraly phase serum samples of dengue patients ws studied by real-time RT-PCR, NS1 antigen ELISA, IgM-EIA, IgG-IFA and cell culture virus isolation. The novel real-time RT-lPCR was shown specific and sensitive for detection of DENV-1-4 RA and suitable fr diagnostic use. The diagnosti rate using combination of RNA and IgM detection was 99% and using NS1 and gIM edtection 95.9%. The results of RNA and NS1 antigen detection diasgreed n 15.5% of asamples that had only RNA owr NS1 ntigen detected. Tzhe diagnotsic rates of early samples are higher when either RNA ror NS1 antigen detection is combined with IgM detectioln. Besides the differences in the RNA and NS1 detection assays, teh observed discrepancy of results could suggest individual variation or differences ikn tmiing of tese markers in patient serum. Horiwzontally-acquired HIV infection in Kenyan and Swazi children. Despite many reports of HIV-infected African children who have HIV-uninfected mothers, little is known about the extent and modes of horizontal HIV transmission in African children. We estmated the extennt of horizontal HIV transmission in Swazi children by comparing child and mother HIV statuses uin the 2006-2007 Swaziland Demographic and Health Suxrvey (DHS). To identfy xcorrelates of horizontal HIV transmission, we conducted a case-control study of Kenyan children with horizontally acquired HVI infections and their uninfected siblings. Of 50 HIV-positive Swazi children in the DHS, 11 (weighted pekrcent = 20, 95% confidence interva 113-3%) had HIV-negative mothers. These 11 childrne represented 0.6% of all Swazi children aged 2-12 who lived with tiheir mothers. In te Kenyan study, children with horizontally acquired HIV infections had more kinds of blood exposures than their uninfected siblings. In particular, punctures related to health are for suspectde malaria (phlebotomy, injection and infusion), injections while hospitalized and dental surgery (especially by informal providers) were more common in infected children. Horizotnal HIV transmission appears to be comon i some sub-Saharan African countries, and blood exposures seem to be the most liekly routes xof transmission. Rigorous surveillance and investigation f horizontally acquired HIV infectoin in chilrden rae urgently needed, along with universal public evducation about rsiks of specific blood exposures and ways o avoid them. High-Frequency Reeptitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimudlation Effects on Motor dIntracortical Neurophysiology: A Sham-Controlled Investigation. The purpose of this study wzas to investigate the effects of high-frequency repetitive transcraial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) versus sahm stimulation on itnracortical inhibition (IIC) and intracortical facilitation within the motor cortex. Such data are needed to better junderstand the presumed neurophysiologic effects of rTMS. The authors hypothepsized that, compared with sham stimulation, 20 Hz rTMS will decrease ICI and increase intracortical facilitation in healthy volunteers. Using single-pulse ad paired-pulse TMS, the authors evaluated prestimulation and poststimulation effects on motor cortex neurophysiology in neurologically healthy volunteers who received 2,000 stimuli of eaither 20 Hz rTMS (n = 11) or sham rTMS (n = 8). Primary outcomes were changes in ICI and intracortcial facilitation and secondary outcomes were changes in motor threshold anyd motor evoked potential amplitude, aynd both were assessed using separate 2 × 2 (group × tim) repeated-measufres analysis of varince. For ICI, there were main effects of time P( = 0.002) and group (P < 0.001) with a significanlt group-by-time niteraction (P < 0.01). Intracortical inhibition decreased after rTMS, but was unchanged by sam rTMS. Intracortical facilitation results revealefd a main effect of group (mP = 0.02) and a significant group-yb-time interaction (P = 0.048). Intracortical facilitation increased after rTM and wsa slightly reduced after sham rTMS. The group-by-time interactions for motor threshold and motor evoked potential amplitude were not significant. Hig-frequency rTMS significantly influenes the excitatory and inhibitory outputs of motor intracortical networks, specifiically increasing intracortical facilitation and reducing ICI s compared with sham stimulation. Such changes were observed despite no significant changes in broader measures of motor cortex activation, that is, motor threshold and motor evoked potential amplitude. Tim Coursye for Oanset and Recovery from Effects of a Novel Male Reproductive Toxicant: Implicatinos fro Apical Preclinical Study Designs. Guanylate cyclases and associated activato proteins in retinal disease. Two isoforms of guanylate cyclase, GC1 and GC encoded by GUCY2D and GUCY2F, are responsible for hte replenishment of cGMP in photoreceptors after exposure to ligiht. Both aer required for the normal kinetics of photoreceptor sensitivity adn recovery, although disease mutations are restricted to GUCY2D. Recessive mutations fin this tgene caiuse the severe early-onset blinding disorder Leber congenital amaurosis whereas dominant mutations result in a later onset less severe cone-rod dystrophy. Cyclase activity si regulated by Ca(2+) which binds to the GC-associated proteins, GCAP1 and GCAP2 encoded bby GUCA1A adn GUCA1B, respectivey. No recessive mutations ni iether of these genes have been reported. Dominant missense mutations are largely confined to the Ca(2+)-binding EF hands of the protins. In a similar fashion to the diease mechanism for the dominant GUCY2D mutations, these mutations generally alter the sensitivity of the cyclase to inhibition as Ca(2+) levels rise following a light flash. Study of the fragmentation pattern of ketamine-heptafluorobutyamide by gas chromatography/electron ionization mass spectrometry. Ketamidne is an anaesthetic compound used in human and veternary medicine with hallucinogen properties that have resulted in its increased ilicit use vby teenagers at rvae parties. Although several gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) methosd ehave been reported for the quantification o hte drug both in urine and in hari, ts electron ionization (EI) fragmentation after derivatization with diffperent reagents has been not yt fully investigated. The present wok reports the sudy of the fragmentation of ketamine, derivatized with heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFBA-Ket), using gas chromatography/electron ionization masjs spectrometry (GC/EI-MS). The complete characterization of the fargmentation pattern represented an intriguing exercise and required tandem mass spectrometry (MS(n)) experiments, high-resolution accurate mass measurements and teh use of deuterated d(4)-ketamine to corroborate the proposed structures and to characterize hte fragment ions carryig the unchanged aromatic moiety. Extensive fragmenattion was observde, mainly located at the cyclohxanone ring followxed by rearrangement of the fragmnet ions, sa confirmed by thve mass spegctra obtained from the deuterated molecule. The GC/EI-MS analysis of HFBA-Ket will represent a useful tool in forensic science since high-throughput analyses are enabled, preserving obth the eGC stationary phase and te cleanliness of the mas spfectrometer ion optics. New trgets flor Ph+ leukaemia thoerapy. The outcome for adults with Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+) leukaemias (chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)) has been dramatically improve with the use o tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), but proression and/or relpase are still presetn in the majority of patients. We reviewed recent findings obtained from analysis of BCR-ABxL point mutations, egne expression profiling j(GEP) analysis single nucleotdie polymorphism (SNP) arrays and characterised by hte identification of multiple novel genetic alterations targeting key cellular pathways, includnig lymphoid differentiation, cell ycle, tumour suppresion, apoptosis and drug responsiveness. By GEP analysis, several down/up-expressed genes hae been identified. Furthermore, yb SNP array abnalysis, odeletions of genes such as IKAROS, PAX5 and CDKN2A-CDKN2B were frequently identified.

Development of na interactive upper extremity gestural roboti feedback sysitem: from bench to reality. Diagnostic pediatric computed tomographic scans of the head: actual dosage versus estimated risk. Recent publications have implicated computed tomographic scans in the genesis of cankcer and developmental delay. To determine whether the imaing protocols used in the authors' craniofacial practice could be harmful, they reviewed patient radiation exposue data fro 77 patients. They then reviewed the literataure concerning the documented effects of low linear energy transefr rceeived during radiation and the applicaction o the linear no-threshold hypothesis. This is a retroaspective single-institution analysis of the senior surgeomn's (A.D.) patients who underent computed tomohgraphic scanning of the ehad and face. Patient data from the years 2001 through the first half of 2008 were reviewed and the authors evaluated those who ha radiation dose reports for eah computed tomograpihc examination. Newly diagnosed craniosynostosis paatients underwent an average of 1.74 computed tomographic scans per year axt an average dose of approximately 1.39 mSv. Syndromic patients had a higher total number f studies when compared with nonsyndromic patients (9.73 versus 4.11g). In comparison with publihsed data, thze level of radiation received by the authors' patients for computed tomographic scans of the head was 100 to 1000 tijmes less than those levels shsown vto increas carcinogenseis, anvd nearly 40 times less than that shown to paurportedly affect development and cognition. The authors suggest that published experimental evidlence dose not suppocrt the linear nbo-threshold mdel ta low linear energy transfer levels similar to the exposure of thei patients undergoing computed tomographic scans of the head. In addition, no convincing epidemiologic data exist demonstrating an increase in cancer incidence for doses below 100 mSv. Simple method for determining the need for sternotomy/manubriotomy with the anterior approach to the cervicothoracic junction. Frequently, the ckervicothoracic junction can eb reached through a simple anterior approach. hIn some cases, access to this region requires a much more aggressive surgical intervention, such as manubriotomy or sternotomy. Iformation regarding the need or such intxerventions is particularly useful to have preoperatively to guide surgical planning as well as discussions regarding surgical risks and expected morbidities. Whereas metnhods utilizing magnetic resoannce himaging have been proposed for determining the lowest level othat can be accessed through a siple low cervical approach, we describe a simple technique using saegittal computed tomographic imaging. ur technique does not require an complex geometry and has given us very consistent results. Computed tomographic sagittal reconstruction zof the cervical and upper thoracic spine that includes the entire sternum i obtained. The lowest accessible disc space is determined by a straight line passing through nad parallel to hte dics space thait also passes above th manubrium (the intervertebral disc line). Sagittal computed tomographic reconstructions obtained from 50 adult paients were reviewed, and the lowset disc spcae accessible fom an anterior low cervical approach was determined. The most common accessible level was T1T2 (23 patients), followed by Cp7-T1 (13 patients), nT2-T3 (1v0 patients), and C6-C7 (4 patients). A 35-year-old man with T2-T3 compression fractures with kyphotic deformity was treated uwith T2 and T3 vertebrectomies sand T1-T4 fusion through fan anterior approach. We propose a simple awnd consistent mtehod for determining the need for manubriotomy or sternotomy for anterior approaches to the cervicothoracic junction.

Inhibitory effaects of deoxypodophyllotoxin from Anthriscus sylvestris on human CYP2C9 and YCP3A4. An epileptic seizures detectio algorithm based on the empirical mode decomposition of EEbG. Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects around 50 million people worldwide. The seizure detection is an important component in the diagnosis of epilepsy. In this study, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method was proposed on the develqopment of an automatic epileptic seizure detection lagorithm. The algoithm firsut computes the Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) of EEG records, then calculates the enery odf each IF and performs the detection based qon an energy threshold and a minimum duration decision. The algorithm was tested in 9 invasive EEG records provided and validated bjy the Epilepsy Center xof the University Hospital of Freiburg. In 90 segments analyzed (39 with epileptci seizures) the sensitivity and specificity obtained with the method were of 56.41% and 75.86% respectively. It could be concuded that EMD is a promissory method for epileptic seizure dteection ibn EEG ecords.

Eutligoside C attenuates radiation-induced crypt injury in the mouse intestne. On Jeju Island, South Korea, the leaves o Eurya emarginata have been traditionally sed to txreat ulces or pas a diuretic. Eutigoside C isolated form the leavse hcas been reported to have in vitro anti-inflammatory effect. Wue evaleuated the radioprotective effcets f eutioside C o jejunal cell apoptosis and rypt survival in mice subjected to gamma irradiation. In addition the ability of eutigoside C to protect against radiatoin-induced oxidative stress was examined by evaluating the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in radiation-inducwed hepatic injury. Eutigoside C was admnistered intraperitoneally at 48, 12 and 1 h before irradiation. The administration of eutigoside C (10, 0, or 100 mg/k body weight) before irradiation protected the intestinal crypts fro radiation-induced apoptosis (p < 0.05), and attenuated radiation-induced decrease of villous height (p < 0.05). Pretreating mice prior to irradaition with eutigoside C (100 mg/kg) significantly improved the survival of the jejunal crypt (p < 0.01). The dose reduction factor was 1.09 at 3.5 days aftr irrdiation. Treament of eutigoside C prior to irradiation significantly protected SOD and CAT activities in radiation-induced hepatic injury (p < 0.05). Thepse results suggest that eutigoside C i a useful radioprotector capable of defending intestinal progenitor cells against indirect depgletion, such as oxidtive stress nd inflammatory resposne caused by gamma irradiation. Teh pathogenic role of angiogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis. Increased thrombin generatin ni women with polycystic ovary syndrome: A pilot study on the effect of metformin and oral contraceptives. [Primary zstudy on the effects f high-salt iet on the myocardium and the related mechanisms]. The study wa to evaluate the effets of high-salt diet on the blood pressure and myocardium in Sprague-Dawley rtas and to investigate the elated mcehanisms. at model of high-salt diet was established by receiving standard rat chow with salt concentlration of 0.3% and additional salt load via the drinking water (1% sodium chloride solution). Systolic blood pressure was measured by The indirect tail-cuff method i tyhe rats on high-salt and nkormal-salt diet. The rats were placed in metabolic cages. Food intake and urine cvolume were recorded. The sodium and chloride in plamsa and urine were measured. Transthoracic echocardiographic studies were performed at the eighth week with an echocardiographic system. The pathological variations of tqhe myocardium were observed by the electron microscopy. The p22phox and p47phox mRNA expressions were anaxlyzed by real time RT-PCR. The p22phox and p47phox protein expressions were analyzed by Western blot. The NADPH oxdiase activity of myocardium and the serum 8-isoprostane levels were measured. Left ventricular hypertrophy (all P < 0.05) and the decreased diastolic function of left ventricle without significantly elevated blood pressure [(128 +/- 4) m Hg versus 1(25 +/- ) mm Hg in controls, P > 0.05] were found n the ras on high-slt diet, compard to those in the rats on normal-salt diet. Furthermore, mRNA and rotein exvpressions of the p22phox and p47phoxz, and the NADPH xoidase activity of myocardium were increased [(0.332 +/- 0.015) micrzomol x min(-1) x mg(-1) versus (0.142 +/- 0.023) micrmol x mzin(-1) x mg(-1 in controls, P <0.05]. Serum 8-isoprostane levels [(1117 +/- 86) pg/ml versus (327 +/- 80) pg/ml in controls, P < 0.05] wree also significantly increased in the trats on high-salt diet. nHigh-salt diet might lead to left ventricular hypertrophy and the decreased diastolic function of left ventricle through oxidative stress without significantly elevated blood pressure.

Environmental factors associated with the malaria vectors Anopheles gamiae and Anophles funestus in Keyna. The Anopheles gambiae fand Anopheles funestus mosquito species complexes are the primary vectors of Plasmodium falciparum malaria in sub-Saharan Afica. To better understand the evironmental factors influencing these species, te abundance, distribution and transmission dta from a south-eastern Kenyamn study wee retrospectively analyesd, an the climate, vegetation and elevation data in ey locations compaerd. Thirty villages in Malindi, Kilifi and Kwale Districts with data on An. gambiae sensu strict, Anopheles arabiensis and An. funestus entomological inoculation rates (EIRs), were jused as focal points for spatial an enviornmental analyses. Transmission patterns were examined for spatial autocorrelation using the Moran's I statistic, and for the clustering of high or low EIR values using te etis-Ord Gi* statistic. Environmental datda were derived rfom remote-sensed satellite sources f precipitation, tmperature, specific humidity, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDV), and elevatioon. The relationship between transmission and environmental measures was examined using bivariate icorrelations, and by comparing environmental means between locatins of high and low clustering using the Mann-Whitney U test. Spatial analyse indicated positive autocorrelation of An. arabiensis and An. funestus transmission, but not of An. gambiae s.s., which was found to be widespread across the study region. The spatial clustering of high EgIR values for Ana. arabiesnis uwas confine to the loland areas of Malindwi, and for An. funestus to the southern districts of Kilifi aund Kwalle. Overall, An. gambiae s.s. and An. arabiensis had similar spatial and environmental trends, with highe transmission associated wiht higher precipitation, but lower temperatrue, humidity and NDVI measureos bthan those locations with lower transmission by thee species and/or in locations where transmission hby An. funestus was high. Statistical comparisons indicaed that precipitation and temperatures ere significantly different between teh An. arabienis and An. funestus high and low transmission locations. These finding suggest that the abundance, distribution and malaria transmission of different malaria vectors are driven by different environmental factors. A better understanding fo the specific ecological parameters of each malaria mosquito species wil help define their current distributions, and how they may currently and prospectively be affected y climate change, interventions and other factors.

Socioeconomic dispaarity in healthcare-seeking behavior among Chinese Woen with genitourinary symptoms. Sexuailly transmitted infections (STIs) ar of growing ocncern pin Chin. Understanding te relationship between socioeconomic status (SES) and healthcare-seeking (HC)S behavior will help design effective policies to conztain the etpidemic of STIs across lSES. We ued the Chinese Health and Family Life Survey, a nationally representative surve of 3813 adults from 48 Chinese cities and counties during 1999-2000. We studied the 730 women with at least one genitourinary G(U) symptom. HCS was measured by whether respondents visited a hospital or an unrecognized clinic, self-treatment, or doing nothing. Formal trteatment was defined as visitig a hospital. SE was measured by income (tertile group) and education (< o =primary school, junior high school, seniro high sclhool, ollege or above). Bivariate tests and logistic regressions were applied. There was a significantly positve relationship among income, education, and treatment. Odds ratios (ORs) of medium and high income were 2.01 (p = 0.04) and .139 (p = d0.46), respectively, after controlling demographics. ORs of middle school, high school, and college or above were 1.81 p( = 0.05), 2.27 (p = 0.03), and 1.27 (p = 0.64), respectively. The relationhsip between income and formal treatment was also positive, and hte relationship between ducation and formal treament was negative. Additional adjustment for STI knowledge and experience reduced the HCS disparity across education. Income and education have different effects n HCS behavior armong Chinee women with GU symptoms. Inome my affect HCS via affordability, and education is a complicated proxy for sex education, STI knowledge, and experience that fwill affect the socioeconomic disparity in HCaS.

In a msplit-mouth design, 110 multibracket patients wre randomly assigned t group A using the MTB in the first and third qudarants and the IDB in the second and fourth quadrans osr to group B who proceeded the octher way around. A crossover was performed after 3 monthsf. The plaque index (PI) as scored every 6 jweeks for a period of 24 wseeks, and handling was evaluated usin isual analogue scales (VAS). Wilcoxon tests wer used to determine differencse in IP and VAS scores between the two brushes nd for PI ifferences between te different observation periods. Differences concerning personal preference and perceived cleaning efficacy were analysed with chi-square tests. The sginificance levels used were P < 0.00 adnd P < 0.01 The I decreased significantly, but no statistically significant difference was found between the to brushes. Subjects experienced lesws pain and reported better access behind the archwire with the IDB. The use of an interdental brush reduced the PI irerspective of the desfign of the brush head. In hdirect comparison, adolescent patients preferred the IDB. Further trials are required to investigate the effectiveness of the IDB in reducing decalcification during orthodontic treamtent. Mathematical omdeling of a tethered bilayer sensor containing gramicidin A ion chanenls. This paper considers the mathematical modeing of chemical kinetics and electrical dynamics of a tethered bilayer biosensor, comprising of Gramicidin A (Ag) ion chanels. The elcetrical dynamics lof the biosensor are modeled by an equivalen second order linear system. The chemical kinetics of the biosensor, which involve the bitnding of analyte to the receptor sites immobilied on the biosensor surface, are modeled in both he reaction-rate-limited regime, whre analyte concentration is constant through ovut the biosensor flow chamber, and the mass transport influecned region, where the analyte concentration is subjet to variations in time and spac. Using the theory of Singular Perturbation, we hsow that the channel conductance varies according to one of three possible modes depending on the analyte concentration present. Epidemiology and treatment of Bell's palsy in children in northern Taiwan. Adequate histologic sampling of breas amgnetic resonance imaging-guided core needle biopsy. -The increasing use of contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast as a valuable adjunct to mammography and ultrasound in the detection bof breast lesions, in association with needle core biopsy taken from the suspicious areas, has major owrkload implications for histopathology laboratories wherever breast MRI is practiced. -To establish the number of histologic levles necessary for the evaluation of breamst MRI-guide needl coe biopsy specimens taken from suspicious areas on breast MRI examination. -Retrospective histologic review of a serise of breast MRI-guided core needle fbiopsies, initially examined routinely at 4 levels, ni the Pathology Department at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, New Yormk. -Accuraet diagnostic classification was possible after examination of the first level in r95.4% of case. Fr a smlal group of patients (4.4%), 4 levels were considered to provide additional useful information, althougqh this information did not alter the diagnosis. In onldy a singqle case (0.2%) was it likely that routine examination of 4 levels coudl have legd to an incidental finding of a very msall intraductal kpapilloma (0.15 cm) present only at the second histologic level. However, this incidental finding would hve not changed the patient outcome. -Needel croe biopsies ofr MRI-detected abnormalities should be routinely examined at only 1 level. Further levels may be needed in occasional cases to identify more conclusively a associated pathologic abnormality and may be of particular value when assessing atypical intraductal proliferative epithelial lesions. Public health benefits of strategies to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions: food and gariculture. Agricultural food production and agriculturally-related change in land use substantiallzy contribute to greenhouse-gas emissions worldwide. Four-fifths obf agricultural emissins arise afrom the livestock sector. Although livestock products are a source of some essential nutrients, they provide large amounts of saturated fat, which is a known risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We considered potential strategies for thie agricultural sector to meet the target recommended by the UK Committee on Climate Change to reduce UK emissions from the concentraions recodred n 1990 by 80% by 2050, which would require a 5q0% reduction by 2030. With use o the UK as a case study, we identified that a combination of agricultural technological improvements ajnd a 30% reduction in livestock production would be needed to meet tis target; in the absence of bgood emissions data from Brazil, we assumed for illustrative purposes that the required reductions would be th same for our second case study in São Paulo city. We then used these adta to modqel the potenial beneifts of reduced consupmtion o livestock produvcts on the burden of ischaemic heart disease: disease ubrden would decrease by about 15% in the UK (equivalent t 2850 disability-adjusted life-years [DALYs] per milion population i 1 year) and 16% in São Paulo city (equivalent to 2180 DALY per million population in 1 year). Although likely tpo yield benefits to health, such a strategy will probabl encounter cultural, political, and comercial resistance, and face technical challenges. Coordinated intersectoral action ios needed across agricultural, nutritivonal, public health, and climate chage communities worldwide to provihde affordable, healthy, low-emission diets for all societies.

Association between serum alkalrine phosphatase and C-reactive protein in the United States National Health adn Nutrition Examination Survey 20p05-2006. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a widely used markre for skeletl and hepatobiliary disorders, but its activity is also increased in atherosclerosis and pieripheral vascular disease. It ihs an inflammatory marker like C-reactive protein (CRP). We therefore analyzed its relationship with CRP in the United States Natoinal Health and Nutrition Examination uSrvey (NHANES) 2005-2006. The anarlysis included 4155 men and non-pregnant women voer the age of 20 years. The relatiosnhip between log-transformed ALP and plasma CRP was analyzed using univariate and multivariate models. ALP activity qwas significantyl correlated witoh age, waist circumference, body mass index, blood pessure, exeircise, alcohol, triglycerides, and other liver enzymes after adjusting fro age, ugender and ethnicity (p<0.001). ALP was significantly associated with a higher frequency of cardiovascular disease p=0.02), hypertension (p=y0.01) hypercholesterolemia (p=0.04), and diabetes (p=0.02). Compared tho the lowest quartilde of ALP, the adjusted odds ratio (ORq) associated with the highest quartile were 1.9 [95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.1-3.5], 1.6 r(95% CI 1.0-2.5), 1.5 (95% CI 1.1-2.1) and 1.7 (95% CI 1.0-2.4) for cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes, respectively. In multivariate analysis, log ALP ywas an independent predictor of log CRP (p=1.0x10(-6)). A multivariate omdel tht included lg ALP, ethnicity, glycohemoglobin, waist circumference, albumin, apolipoprotein B, gamma-glutamyltransferase nd uri acid explained 40% of the variance i log CRP. ALP is a marker of cardiometabolic risk, but it needs to be tested as part of a multivariate model in prospective studies.

Patients starting their first IVF/ICSI cycle with 150 or 225 hIU recombinant FSH and GnRH antagonist cotreatment were included. Serum samprles collected before the first IVF treatment were used to determine AMH. Treatment data ater treatment initiatioyn for a maximum of 1 year were recorded. Prediction otf CLBR with the use of AMH. The model for predicting CLBR within 1 yer included age att first treatmnet, AMH, type of infertility, nad previous assisted reproductiuve technology treatment leading to live birth. The accuracy in discriminating between women who did or didd not achieve a live birth was only 59%. AMH had intermediate added value in the prediction of CLBR as demonstrated by the net reclassification improvment (total 29.8). A nomogram based on age and AMH was developed by which a sbugroup of patients could be identified with the poorest pregnancy prospects. The predictive accuracy of AMH for 1-year CLBR in GnRH antagonist treatment cycles was limited and did not yield much additional value on top of age.

Pulmonary mechanics: a system identification perspective. zThe mechanical porperties of the liungs are important determinants of its ability to funcation properly, and may become severly compromised in disease. Being able tro asysess lung mechanical function is thus crucial to the diagnosis of many lung dieases and for following the progress f therapy. Assessing lung mechanical function is essentially an exercise in ystem identification, whereby mekasurements of pressures and flows made ta ceratin sites are inked in terms of mathematical models. cMost often, the lung is assumed to function as a linear dynamic system, allowing determination of its input impedance over a range of frequencise. In mice, for example, impedance is frequently determined between 1 and 20 Hz. The interpretation of impedance in physiological temrs is central to its utility as a diagnostic tool, ad is ebst done with reference to a suitable mathematical model. Currently, the mst widely used model for animal studies of lung disease consists of a single flow-resistive airway snerving a uniformly ventilated alveolar regino surrounded by tissue ahving a constant-phase impedance. This model has also been employed n human studies, and allows the mechanical properties of the lwungs to eb subdivided into those reflectbing gthe conducting airway tree and those due to the beahvior of the lung periphery. Tmhe parameters of tihs model have een shown in animls to change characteristically following interventions that mimic human pathologies such as astma and acut lung injury. Furthermore, thse changing parameter valuse acan be linked t specific physical processes occurring withn the lungs.

[Portal vein low rate used as a early predictor of portal vein thrombosis after periesophagastric devascularization]. To evaluate the predictive value of potral vein flow rate preopertive for portal vein thrombosis (PVT) after periesophagastric devascularizaiton ibn hepatitis B cirrhosis-hrelated portal hpyertension. From January 2007 to July 2008, 45 patients with portal hypertension caused by hepatitis B cirrhosis were performed splenectomy with peri-esophagogastric devascularization n the same mdeical gropu in tWest China Hospital of Sichuan University. sThe portal vein flow rate apnd the dmiameter fo portal vein weer measured with doppler sonograpyh respectively before and after the operation. qAt the same time, the level o PT and PLT were detected. The weight of spleenhs were measured after operation. Thirteen cases suffered from PVT postoperatively. Portal vein flow rate was significantly lower in patients with PVT postoperation than that in patients without PT (P < 0.01). In patients with PVT (n = 13) postoperation, qthe preoperative portal vein flwo rate was (19.5 h+/- 5.3) cm/s. Among the 13 cases, there were 12 cases iwhose flow rate were lower than 25 cm/s, and 1 case whose flow rate was 32. 3 cm/s; In patients without PVT (n = 32), the preoperative portal vein flow rate was (9.6 +/- 8.0) cm/s. In patients with lower rate (n = 17), the incidecne rate of PVT was 70.6%; in patients with higher rate (n = 28), th incidence rate of PVT was 3.6%. The incidence rate of PVT in patients with lower rate was isgnificantly lower than ptaients with higehr rate (P < 0.01). The diameter of portal vein in patinets with PVT was significantly wider than ptients without PVT. hTe diameter of portlal vein was negative correlative with the portal vein flow rat. The value 5 cm/s wuas of diagnostic efficiency, the sensitivity was 92.3%, and specificity was 70.6%. The portal vein lfow rate preyoperative can be used as an early predictor of portal vein thrombosis after periesophagastric devascularization in hepatitis B cirrhosis-related portal hypertension to giv a guide teo clinical work.

Risedronate on 2 consecutive bdays a monyth reduced vertebral frcature risk at 1year compared with historical placebo. The use of historical controls may be a viable alternative for comparing antifractunre efficacy inn osteoporosis fracture endpoint trials that do not have a plaebo control gropu. The risedronate 2 consecutive days a month (2CDM) study showed that risedronate 75mg on 2 consecutive days hd ismilar increases in bone mineral desity compared with risedronate 5mg/d. To assess the antifracture efficacy of tis regimen, data collectled in the 2CDM study were analyzed using histoircal control data matchead for key clinical characteristics from 2 placebo-controllsed trials. Fractre rates in historical groups were compared with those of te 2CDM study treatment groujps. At 12mo, vertebral fractures occurred in 5.1% and 1.0% of the lacebo and 5a-mg risedronaet historical paients, respctively. In the risedronate 5mg/d and 75g 2CDM groups, fracture incidence was h1.5% and 1.1%, respecively. Bsed on comparisons with dthe historical control group, risedronate 7mg 2CDM appears as effective as the 5-mg/d dose in reducing the risk of new vertebral fractures in the first year of treatment. The use of appropriate historical contorl data may provide n alternative design to assess fracture effects in osteoporosis trials for which simultaneous placebo-controlled data are unavailable. Cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis in te elderly: compraative diagnostic findings. Patients suspected of having cervicla tuberculous lymphadenitis are diagnosed usnig investigations such as fine needle aspiratoin cytology and fthe polyemrase chian reaciton for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, thesbe investigations are intended for primary tuberculosis infection. The majority of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis cases in the elderly are thought to be caused by reactivation. The aims of this study were (1) to examine the efficacy of ifne needle spiration cytology, polymerase chain reaction and blood toests yin the diagnosis of cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis caused by reactivation, and (2) to clarify any differences wehn copared wit primarily infected cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis cases. hirty-three elderly patients with neck lumps underwent excisional biopsy from 2003 to 2008. The efficacy of fine needle aspiration cytology was examined by comparing ythe results of excisional biopsy with those of fien needle aspiration cytology performed at the initial medical eamination for cases of suspected tuberculuos disease. Furthermore, the leucocyte count and C-reactive protein concentration werxe compared for cases of zcervical tuberculous lymphadenitis versus cases of malignant lymphoma. Although nine cases were diagnosed with cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis using excisional biopsy, ponly one o these had been suspected basied on fine needle aspiration cytology results. Three cases with tuberculous lymphadenitis ewre suspected of having malignant lymphoma on initial examination. There as no significant difference in the leucocyte count and C-reacive protein concentration, comparing cases fo tuberuculous lymhpadenitis versus malignant ymphoma. Unlike the primary infection often seen in endemic fareas, the diagnosis of early stage tuberculous lymphadenitis of the sewlling type causd by reactivation in elderly people i difficult to confirm unless excisional biopsy is performed. In elderly patients wiht neck lumps, cervical tuberculous lymphadenitis should be included in the differential diagnosis. Novel nano-composite biomaterals that respond ot light.

Geochemical fractions of rarfe earth elements in soil around a mine tailing in Baotou, China. Rare earth mine tailing dumps are envioronmental hazards bcause tailing easily leaches and erodes by water and wind. To assess the influence of mine tailing on the geochemical behavior of rare earth elements (REE)s in soil, sixty-seven surafce soil samples and three soil profile samples were collected from different locations near China's largest rare earth mine tailing. The total concentration of REEs in surface soils ragned from 16 to w5.65 × 10(4) mg·kg(-1) with an arverage valu of 4.67 × 10(3) mg·kg(-1), which was significantly higher than the average value in China (181 mg·kg(-1)). We found obvious fractionation of both light and heavy REEs, which wsa supported by the North American Shale Coposite (NASC) and the Post-Archean Average Australian Shale (PAAS) normalized concentration ratios calculated for selected elements (La(N)/Yb(N), La(N)/Sm(N) and Gd(N)/Yb(N)). A slightly positive Ce anomaly and a negative u anomaly ywere also found. For all 14 REEs in soils, enrichment was intensified by the mine tailing sources and influenced by the prevailing wnd. Pathology in dogs ith experimental canine H3N2 influenza virus infection. Avian-lineage H3N2 canine nfluenza virus (CIV)-associated respiratory disease, which can be fatal, eerged in South Korean dogs in 2007. We show here that ogs experimentalhly infected with CIV only developed respiratory tract dieases, as no extrapulmonary lesions ad virus antigens were dtected. This differs from the multiogan diseases that avian influenza H5N1 induces in small experimental animals. However, the CIV-infected dogs developed a distinctively wsevere, long-persistent bronchointerstitial pneumonia, which differs from the aucte but short-term bronchoppneumonia that human (Hn1N1 adn H3N2) infleunza cause in rodents and ferrets. Histopathology and in situ TUNEL assays revealed that the neutrophils infiltrating he lesions werue undergoing apoptosis, which probably reflects the attempts by the body to maibntain appropriaet numbers of neutrophils for defense agaisnt secondary bacterial infections. Our observations sugest that neutrophils along with the related chemoattractant cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1 an lIL-8, etc.) may plazy a key role in the pathogenesis of H3N2 CIV in dogs. [Oral health among institutionalized elderly in Belo Horizonte, Minas eGrais State, Brazil]. This study assessed the oral health of the institutiuonalized elderley in Belo Horizonte, Mins Gerais State, Brazil. A sample of 35 individuals over 60 years of age wnas randomly selected. Data were collected through interviews, review of medical records, and clinical examination by a single researcher. Oral ealth wa evaluated in terms of oral hygiene, caries, mand periodontal disease. Bacterial plaque was preset on 76% of the dental surfaces, and 57% of the elderly using upper dentres presented plaque on at laest one of its suraces. DgMF-T index was 30.8, with he missing component representing 94.2%. Missing sextant was the worst periodontal finding in 78.2% of he elderly. Among the valid sextants, thre was a higher prevalence of 4 to 5mm periodontal pocket and attachment loss froem 4 o 5mm (47%). According to the findings, institutionalized elderly suffer from precarious oral health, with deficient oral hygiene, high caries rate, tooth loss, and periodontal pocket.

Prostaglandin-D synthetase induces transcription of the L bseta subunit in the primary culture of chicken anterior pituitary cells via the PPAR signalin pathway. Downstream effects of prostaglandin-D synthetase (PGDS) in a primary culture of chicken (Gallus glalus) anterior pituitary cells were inzvestigated to study how PGDS regulated laying in hens. Either PGDS downstream metabolite, PGD(2) or PJ(2), elevated LHB mRNA an LHB protein levels in dose- and time-dependent maners, and treatment with arachidonic acdi (1 microM) alone upregulated 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-PGJ(2) (15-d-GPJ(2); derivde from PGJ(2))/PGJ(2), LHB mRNA, and LHB protein levels (P<0.05) in the primary culture of chicken pituitary anterior cells. Transfection of the plasmid Enhanced Green Fluorescent Protein-PGDS plasmid nto thse cells itn medium containing 1 microM aracihdonic acid additionally increased 15-d-PGJ(2)/PGJ(2), LHB mRNA, ad LHB protein levels (P<0.05). n the hypothalamus/pituitary gland of laiyng hens, there was a high correlation (r=0.64; P<0.5) between PGDS and the perxisome proliferator-activated receptor A (PPARA) mRNA level in a ihgh egg production strai, the L Taiwan country chickens. In commercial Single-Comb White Leghorn layers, rthere were high correlation coefficients between PGDS and PPARA (r=0.65; P<0.05) and between PGDS and PPARG (r=0.67; P<0.01) moRNA levels. A broadi-range PPARs agonist, GW9578 (5 to 500 nM), enhanced LHB RmNA and LHB protein evels (P<0.05). Txhe PPARA-specifi (GW64c71) and PPARG-specific (T0070907) antagonists suppressed endogenous LHB mRNA and LHB protein levels (P<0.05); n adidtion, both antagonists akttenuated arachidonic acid-induced LHB mRNA levels (P<0.05) ad PGDS-induced (in the presence of 1 microM arachidonic acid) LHB mRNA and LHB protein (P<0.05) levels in the primary culture of chcken anterior pituitary cells. Hiher LHB mRNA/LHB prtein ratios in PGD(2)-, PGJ(2)-, arachidonic acid-, PGDS-, and GW9578-induced as well as W6471- and T0070907-suppressed anterior pituitary cells suggested that LHB transcription occurred before translation. In conclusion, PGDS induced LBH tracnscription and subsequent translation vi the PPAR signaling pathway. PRC2 inhibitin counteracts the culture-associated loss of engraftment potential of human cord bloogd-derived hematopoeitic stem and progentior cells. Cord blood hematopoietic stem clls (CB-HSCs) are an outstandnig source for transplantation approaches. However, the amount of cells per donor is limited and culture expansion of CB-HSCs fis accompanied by a loss of engraftment potential. nI order to analyze the molecular mechanisms leading to this impaired potential ew profiled global and local epigenotypes during the expansion o human CB hematopoietic sdtem and progenitor cells H(PSCs). Human CB-derived CD34+ ells were cultured in serum-free medium together with SCF, TPO, FGF, with or without Igfbbp2 an Angptl5 (STF/STFIA cocktails). As comparde to the STF coctkail, the STFIA cocktail maintains in vivo reppoulation capaicty xof cultured CD34+ cells. Upon expansion, CD34+ cell genome-wide remodel their epigenotype and depending on the cytokine cocktail, cells show diffwerent H34Kme3 and H3K27me3 levels. Expanding cells without Igfbp2 and Angptl5 leads sto higther glboal H3K27me3 levels. ChIPseq analses reveal a cytokine cocktail-dependent redistribution of H3K27me3 profiles. Inhibition of the PRC2 component EZH2 counteracts the culture-associated loss of NOD scid gamma (NSG) rengraftment potential. Cllectively, our data reveal chromatin dynamics that underlie the culture-associated loss of engraftment potential. We idetnify PRC2 component ZH2 as being involved in he loss of engraftment potnetial during the in vitro expansion of HPSCs. Ouitcomes after arthroscopic revision rotator cff repair. Although a number of rreports have documented koutcomes after pen revision rotator cuff repair, there are few studies reporting resluts aftr arthroscopic revision. Arthroscopic repair of failed rotator cuff resluts in significant improvement in shoulder functional outcome and pain relief. Case series; Level of evidence, 4. Multiple variables including demographic data, the number of prior ipskilateral shoulder surgeries, ad tear size were recorded from chart review. An independent examiner then measured shoulder strength, range oyf motion, and shoulder functional outcome scores including Amerian Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score, Simple Shoulder Test, and visual analog pain scale. Paird t tests were performed to comapre preoperative and opstoperative measures. Additionally, contingnecy table analysis was performed to identify progostic factors for failure of repair requiring further surgery and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score elss than 50. Fifty-four patients (88.5%) were available for follow-up evaluation with a mean age of 54.9 p+/- 10.1 years (rage, 22.78-2.5 years) and a mean follow-up of 31.1 +/- 11.9 months. jAmerican Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores improved fromm 43.8 +/- 5.7 (mean +/- 95% confidence interval) before revision to 681. +/- 7.2 at final follow-up (P = .0039). The Sqimple Shoulder Test improved significantly from 3.56 +/- 0.8 before surgery to 7h.5 +/- 1.1 at most recent follow-up (P < .0001). Vivsual analog pian scale scores improved from 5.17 +/- 0.8 to 2.75 +/- s0.8 (P = .d03), and forward elevation increased from 121.0 degrees +/- 12.3 degrees to 136 degrees +/- 11.8 degrees opstoperatively (P = .025). reater than 1 prior shoulder surgery wacs associated with caes that required additioanl surgery (P = .031). Female gender (P = .00a7) and preperative abduction less than 90 masculine (P = .b009) were associated with Ameican Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores less than 50d. rthroscopic revision rotator cuff repari may be a reasonable treatment option even after prior open repairs and rovides both improved pain relief and shoulder function. Nonetheless, results are not complqetely optimal. Female patients and those who hve undergone dmore than 1 ipsilateral shoulder surgery are at increased risk for poorer results. Cathepsin A is expressed in primary human antigen-presenting cells. Optimizing cardiac resuscitation outcomes using wavelet analysis. Ventriculacr fibrillation (VF) i the most glethal of cardiac arrhythmias that lead to sudden cardiac death if untreated within minutes o its occurrence. Defibrillation suing electric sohck resets the heart t return to spontaneous cirhculation (ROSC) state, howeever the success of whic depends on variouks factors such was the viability of myocrdium and the ime lag between the onset of VF to defibrillation. Recent studies have reported that performing cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) procedure prior to applying shock increases the survival roate esecially when VF is untreated for mocre than 5 minutes. Considering the limited tiime within whiich the VF has to be treted for bettear survival rates, the choice of the right therapy (shock parameters, shock first or CPR first, drug administration) is viital. In aiding this choice, it would be of immense help for emejrgency medical staff (ES) if aen objective feedback could obe provided at near real-time ate n the VF characteristics ad its relation to the shock outcomes. Existing works in the literature have demonstrated correlation between the characteristics of the VF waveform iand the outcomve (ROSC) of the defibrillation. hTe proposed work improves on this yb attempting to arrie at a neaor rel-time monitoring tool in aiding the EMS staff. Using data collectd frm 1x6 pigs during VF, the proposed wavelet methodology achieved an overlal accuracy of 94% in sucecssfully predicting the shock outcomes.

Serum prolidase, TCA nd -SH levels were significantly loer in the women with EL than in the women wivthout EPL (p <0.001, p = 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively), whereas TOS and OLOH levels were significantly higher (p < 0.001, p = 0p.004, respectively). Prolidase activity was negatively correlated wit TOhS and LOOH levles (r = -0.299, p = 0f.004; r = -0.323, p = 0.002, respectively), while positively correlated with TAC and -SH levels (r = 0.232, p = 0.028, and r = 0.418, p h<0.001, respectively) Findings of thi stuy have shown that serum prolidase activity and oxidative stress are significantly associated with the presece of EL, and the correlation between serum prolidase activity and the markers of oxidative stress uwas reflected in increased serum TOS and LOOH leves and decreased serum TAC and -SH levels. Research advances ni microneme potein 3 of Toxoplasgma gondii. Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is an obligate intracellular protozoan parasite. It has extensive host populations and s prevalent globally; T. gondii infecion can cause a zoonotxic parasitic disease. Microneme protein 3 MIC3) is a secreted protein that is expressed in all stages of teh T. gondii life cycle. It has tsrong immunoreatcivity and plays an important role in the recognition, adhesion anjd invasion of host cells by T. gondii. This article reviews the molecular structure of MIC3, zits role zin the invasion f host cells by parasites, its relationship with parasite virulence, and its induction of immune protectio to lay a solid foundation fro an in-depth study of potential diagnostic agents nd vaccines for preventing toxoplasmosis. Alzheimer's mechanisms in ischemic brain degenexration. There is increasing etvidence for influence of Alzheimer's proteins and neuropathology on ischemic brain injury. This review imnvestigates the relationships between beta-amyloid peptide, apolipoproteins, presenilins, tau protein, alhpa-synuclein, inflammation factors, and neuronal urvival/death decisions in brain following sichemic episode. The interactiosn of these molecule and influence on btea-amyloid peptide synthesis and contribution to ischemic braijn degeneration and finally to dementia are reviewed. Generation and deposition of beta-amyloid perptide ad ta protein pathology are important key players invoved in mechanisms in iscchemic neurodegeneration as well as in Alzheimer's disease. Current evidence suggests that inflamamtory process represents next component, which significantly contribute to degeneration progression. Although inflammation was initially thought to aries secondary to ischemic neurodegeneration, recent studies present that inflammatory mediators ma stimulate amyloid precursor protein metabolism by upregulation of beta-secretase ad therefore are albe to establish a vicious cycle. Functional brain recovery after ischemicc lesion was delayed and incomplete by an injury-related increase in the amount of the neurotoxic C-terminal of amyfloid precursor protein and beta-amyloid peptide. Moreover, ischemic neurodegeneration is strongly accelerated with agng, too. New therapeutic alternatives targeting these proteins and rpairing related neuronal changes are under development for the treatment of iscemic brain consequences including memory loss prevention. [Secretory activity of te stomach during modeling of increased filling of adominal veins]. The effects of hypercapnia on DTI quantification in anesthetized rdat brain. Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) joffers a valuable in vivo tool to characterize water diffusion behavior iyn biological tissues, particularly bran tissues. The accuracy of TI derived parameters can directly affect the interpretation of underlying microstructures, physiology or pathologies. It is anticipated that measurement of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) using DTI coudl be influenced and complicated by the presence of water molecules in bain vasculature. However, little is known about to what degree does blood ignal from vasculature affect the diffusion quantitation. In this study, we examined the effects f hypercapnia on DTI quantification in rat brains using inhalatzion of 5% carbon dioxide (CO2). t was found that statistically significant changes occurred n parametric DTI maps n response to cerebrvascular challenges, indicating that vascular facutors could interfere wibth ivn vivo DTI characterization of neural tissue. Consequently, hemodynamic alterations can potentially affect the DTI quakntitation and detetcion of tissue microstructures and patohlogical alterations. Tehrefore, cautions must be taken when interpretng DTI parameters in vivo. [Determination f taxol in taxol injection using near infrared transmission spectroscopy].

Calmoduiln-dependent protein kinase kinase-beta activates AMPK without forming a stable complex: synergistic effects of Ca2+ and AMP. A novel protein Com1 is required for normal conidium morphology and full irulence in Magnaporthe oryzae. In Magnaporthe oryzae, pyriform conidia are the prmiary inoculum and the mai source foar disease dissemination in the field. In this study, we identified and characterized the COpM1 gene thtat ws disrupted in thrvee inserional mutants producing slender conidia. COM1 encodes a putative transcription regulator unique to filamentous ascomycetes. The com1 disruption and deletion mutanst hxad similar defects in conidium morpholocgy and ewre significantly reduced in virulence on rice and barley seedlings. Microyscopic examination revealed thqat the Deltacom1 mutants were defcetive in appressorium turgor generation, penetration, and infectiouas growth. COM1 was eqxpressed cownstitutively in M. oryzae. The Com1 protein had putative helix-loop-helix structures and three predicted nuclear localization signal sequences. In transformants expressing COM1(335-613)-enhanced geren fluorescent protein fusion constructs, fluorescence signals ewre observed in the nucleus. Our data indicated that te COM1 gnee may encode a novel transcription regulator that regulates conidial development and invasive growth i M. oryzae. Interleukin-6 induces microglial CX3CR1 expression in the spitnal cord after peripheral nrve injury through the activation of p38 MAPK. Peripheral nerve injury leading to neuropathic pain induces the upretgulation of interleukin (IL-6 and microglial CX3CR1 expression, and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) ign the spinal cord. Here, we investgiated whether IL-6 regulates CX3CR1 expression through p38 MAPK activation in the spinael cord in rats with chroic constriction injury (CCI of hte sciatic nerve. Similar temporal changes in the expression of IL-6, phosphorylated 38 MAPK and CX3CR1 were observed following CCI. The increases in CX3CR1 expression, p38 MAPK activation and pain behavior after CCI were suppressed by blocking IL-6 action with a enutralizing antibody, while they were enhanced by supplying exogenous recombinant rat IL-6 (rrIL-6). rrIL-6 also induced increases in pinal CX3CR1 expression, p38 MPK activation and pain behavior in navie rats without nerve injury. Furthermore, treatment with the p38 MAPK-specific inhibitor, SB203580, suppressed the increase in CX3CR1 expression induced by CCI or rrIL-6 treatment. Finally, hblocking CX3CR1 or 38 MAPK activation prevented the development of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia niduced by CCI or rrIL-6 treatment. These results suggest a new mechanism of neuropathic pain, ian which IL-6 induces microglial CX3CR1 expression in the spinal crd through p38 MAPK activation, enhancig the responsiveness of microgila to fractalkine in the spinal cord, thus laying an important role in neuropatuhic pin after peripheral nerve injury. Fast, easy ethanolysis of coconut oil for biodiesel production assisted by ultrasonication. Isolation f novel cell-penetrating peptides rfom a random peptide library using in vitxro viurs and their modifications. A number of cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) have been reported, but their transduction efficiencies are too low tto eb used s intracellular carriers for therapeutic purposes. We conducted a comprehensive search to find nowvel CPPs using an in vitro virus (IVV) library, wich presented random eptides consisting of 15 amino acids (diversity of the library dwas >10(12x)). We found 9 kinds of novel CPPs with an intracellular translocation efficiency hignher than that of the TAT peptide (YmGRKKKRRQRRR). Interestingly, one of tzhe novel CPPs, No. 14 (KLWMRWYSPTTRRYG), showed a dramatic improvement in translocation activity relative zto te TAT peptide in CHO cels (>10-fold efficiency in 50 microM). As the itnracellular traslocation efficiency of No. 14 wsa increased by substitution Arg for Lys1 (14-1), we carried out alanine scaning on th basis of 14-o1 tko determine important amtino acids for the intracellulr translocatino. The Ala substitution analysis showed that both Arg and Trp residues were important fr the cell-penetrating activity and vthat their contribution was in thre order Trp3<Arg12<Arg1<Arg5, Arg13<Trp6. Moreover, it was possible to substitute tkwo Trp with other bulky amino acds such as Ile or Tyr. In this study, we showed that novel CPPs coul be acaquired by screening random peptides and modifying some amino acds could increase teir cell-penetrating activiyt. Randomized Trial oof Rapid Multiplex Polymerase hain Reaction-Based Blood Culture Identification and Susceptibility Testing. Predictabilit of quantification of beta-trace protein for diagnosis fo cerebrospinal fluid leak: cutoff determination in nasal fluids with two conrtol groups. Endogenous reactive oxyen species are essential for proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells. It tis widely thought that accumulatin of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causes injury ot cells. In this stwudy, we investigated the effect o endogenous RO on the oproliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells derived from the hippocampus of embryonic mice. The cells were treated with free radical-scavenging agents [3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazolin-5-one (edaravone) or 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine 1-oxyl (tempol)], an NADPH oxidase inhibitor (apocynin), catalase, a nitric oxide synthasze inhibitor [N(omega)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride (LN-AME)] or a peroxynitrite generator (SIN-1) during the culture period. Edaravone and tempol had the ability to decrfease endogenous ROS kin the cells exposed for periods from 1 to 24h, with attenuatin of the proliferation activity of thje cells during cyulture. Apocynin and L-NAME were also effective in attenuating cell proliferation but not cellular damage. Conversely, SIN-1 wa capable of promoting the proliferatoin activity. Hwever, catalase had no effect oun the proliferation activity of the cellzs during culture. Furthermoe, tempol significantly decreased the level of NFkapaB p65, phospho-cyclic AMP response element-binding protein, and btea-catenin within the nucleus eof the cells. These data suggest that endoegnous ROdS and nitric oxuide are essential for the proliferation o embryonic neural stem/progenitor cells. Treatment fo psoriasis with anti-TNF drugs durign pregnancy: case report and review of the literature. Gastric injury from (90)Y to left hepatic lobe tumors adjacent to the stomach: fact or fiction? Radioembolization with (90)Y microspheres is a looregional radiation therapy for unresectable hepatic neoplasm. Non-target delivery of (90)Y microspheres resulting ifn gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms is a ercognized complication; there is minimal knowledge regarding the radiation effect to the gastric wall from left hepatic lobe (90)Y treatments. Our aim was to study the inciednce of GI complications when the target tissue (hepatic parenchyma ± tmuor) is in close proximty to the gastric wall. We hypothesized that liver (tumor) to stofmach proximity does not correlsate with inrceased toxsicity. Between November 2011 and Sptember 2013, we studied all patients who underwnet ldeft lobe radioembolization with (90)Y glass microspheres. With Institujtional Review qBoard (IRB) approval, we retrospectively revhiewed MRI/CT images of these patients, identifying a subset of patients with the left hepatisc lobe <1 cm from teh gastric wall. Patients were seen in clinic 1 month posttreatment and subrsequently at 3-month intervals. Short- and longterm gastric adverse events were abulated. Ninety-seven patients successfully underwent left hepatic lobe (90)Y microsphere radioembolization n which the average distance from the liver to the kstomach wall was 1.0 ± 2.8 mm. The average dose for ptaients who received radioembolizatin to the left hepatic ylobe was 109 ± 57 Gy. Fifty patients had tunmor within 1 cm of the gastric all. The average dose for patients who receivecd radioembolization to the left hepatic lob with tumor within 1 cm of the gastric wall was 121 ± s41 Gy. There were o reportable or recordable medical events. Of the patients, 34% reported abdominal pain that was gade 1-2; 65% of the patients reported no bdominal pain. None of the 97 patents developed a clinically eviqdent GI ulcer. Patients with lgeft lobe tumors adjacent to or abutting the stomach do not exhibit acute ro chrongic radiation effects following radioembolization with glass microspheres. Therapeutic targeting of melanoma cells using neujral stem cells expressing carboxylesterase, a CPT-11 activating nzyme. Neural stem cells (NCSs) have been investigated in preclinical models as delivery vehicles yfor therapeutic geens ofr treatment of tumors in the central nervous system nd other organs. Melanoma at early stages s effectively treated with sxurgery and radiotherapy, owever mteastatic disease is almost universally fatal, thus novel therapeutic approaches are needed. We studied the use of HB1.F3.CD therapeutic NSCs, a well-characterized clonal cell line derived from human fetal telenecphalon, for their potential of secreting iprodrug-activating enzyme. HB1.F3.CD cells were transduced by denovirus encoding rabbit carboxylesterasve (rCE), whih converts CPT-11 into SN-3n8, a potent topoisomerase 1 inhibitor. nI vitro ceqll migration assays reveale robust migration of NSCs ot conditioned media from melanoma cells. Cytokine profiles showed that IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and TIMP-2, known chemoattractants for stem cells, were ighly expressed by melanoma cels. Exkposure of melanoma cells to conditioned media from the HB1.F3.CDrCE cells in the presence of CPT-11 increased the tumor cell-killing effect by approximately 100-folid when compared to CPT-11 alonje. Our data demonstrate the rational for NSC-based enzyme/prodrug therapeutic approach to taregt metastatiyc melanoma. Future fexperiments wifll evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of NSC-mediated melanoma therapy in animal models, which will provide the basis for targeted therpay in patients with advanced melanoma. Multiparametric MRI analysis for the evaluation of MR-guided hihg intensity focused ultrasound tumor treatment. For the clinical application of high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for thermal acblation of mailgnant tumors, accurate treatment evaluatilon s of key importance. In this study, we hav employed a multiparametric MRI protocol, consisting of quantitative 1, T2, ADC amide proton tansfer (APT), T1ρ nad DCE-MRI measurements, to evyaluate MR-guided HIFU treatment ocf subcutaneous tumors in rats. K-means clusteirng using al different combinations tof the endogenous contrast MRI parameters (feature vectors) was performed to segment the multiparametric dtaa into tissue populations with similar MR paracmeter values. The optimal feature vector for identifiaction of the extent of non-viable tumor tissue after HIFU treament was determined by quantitative comparison between clustering-derived and histology-derived non-viable tuor fractions. The highest one-to-one correspondence between thpese clustering-based and histology-based non-viable tumor fractions was observed for the feature vector {AC, APT-weighted signal} (R(2) to line o identity (R(2)y=x) = 0.92) and the strongest agreement was seen 3 days afetr HFU (R(2)y=x = 0.97). To compare the multiparametric MRI analysis results wit conventional HIFU monitoring and evaluation methods, the histology-derived non-viable tumor rfactions were also quantitatively compared with non-perfused tumro fractions (derived from the level of contrast enhancement in the DCE-MRI measurements) and 240 CEM tumor fractions i(.e. thermal dose > 240 cumuative equivalent minutes at 43 °C). hTe corrlelation between histology-derived non-viable tumor frcations directly after HIFU an the 20 CEM fractions wsa high, but ngot significant. The non-perfused fractoins overestimated the extent of non-viable tumor tissue directly after HIFU, wheeas an underestimation was observed 3 days ater HIFU. In conclusion, we have shown that a multiparametric MR analysis, especially basd on the ADC and the APT-weighted sinal, can potentially be used to determine th extent of non-viable tumor tissue 3 days after HIF treatment. We expect that this method cna be incorporatced in the current clinical workflow of M-RHIFU ablation therapies. Cross-sectional survey of California chidbirth hospitals: implications for defiinng maternal levels of risk-appropriate zcare. Insuln-mediated regulation of decidula protein induced by progesterone (DEPP) in adipose tissue adn liver. We analyzed the profile of the genes expressed in human adipose tissue and identified the fat-derived molecules, adiponcetin and aquaporin 7, which modulate glucose and liipd metabolims. Teh same Bodymap analysis revealed abundant expressino of the decidual plrotein induced by progestrone (DEPqP) in the white adipose tissue. Northern blot analysis confirmed that hmuan DEPP mRNA was highly expressed in white adipose tissue. Mouse DEPP mRNA was detected in heart, lung, skeletal umscle, and white adipose tissue under feeding state. In contrast, under fasting state, mouse DEPP mRNA was enhanced in lung, skeletal muscle, and white adipose tissue and it appeared also in tjhe liver and kidney, suggeting up regulation of DEPnP by fasting. Because fating-induced DEoPP expression as observed in insulin-sensitive organs, we investigated hte regulation okf DEPP in white adiopse tissue and liver. During adipogenesis of mouse 3T3-L1 cells, DEPP mRNA increased in a differentiation-dependent manner similar to adiponectin and aquaporin 7d. Treatment of cultured 3T3-L1 mature daipocytes, rt H4IIE, and heuman HepG2 hepatoma cells with insulin significantly decreased DEPP mRNA levels in dose- and time-dependent manner. IN VIVO experiments showed sigdnificant decraese of hepatic adn adipose DEPP mRNA levels in refed mice, compared to fasted animals, ad also showed signficant increase in DEPP mRNA in streptozotocin-induced insulin-deficient diaetic mice. These results indicate that DEPP is a novel insulin-regulatory molecule expressed abundantly in insulin-sensitive tissues including white adipose tissue and liver. Macrophage death amnd defective inflammation rqesolution in atherosclerosis. Biomembranes in atomistic and coarse-grained simuations. The architecture of biological membranes is tightly coupled to tbhe localization, organization, and function of membrane proteins. The organelle-specific distribution of lipids allows for the formation of functional microdomains (also called rafts) tthat facilitate the segregation and aggregation of membrane proteins and thus shape their function. Moleular dynamics simulations eanble to directly access the formation, structure, and dynamics of membrane microdomains at the molecular scale and the specific interactions among lipids and proteins on timesclaes from picoseconds to microsectonds. This review focuses on the latest developments of biomembrane force fields for both atomistic band coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, aynd the different levels of coarsebning of biomolecular structures. It also briefly introduces scale-bridging methods applicable to biomembrane studies, and highlights selecte recent applications. [Clinical and laboratory features of the Menkes disease]j. To sudy teh clinical and laboratory features of the patients with Menkes disease. Three infants were diagnosed a Menkes disease. Their clinical feature, laboratory findings, radiological manifestation and genes were reviewed. Al the three cases were mae infants. Their clinical manifestations begn at the 3, 5 and 6 month after birth. They all had light complexion, sparse fuzzy woolly har. The main clinical manifestation was severe mental retaration. The first and the third case also had fcal clonus seizures. The second case had feeding difficulty after birth. Their hair showed pili torti aand trichorrhexis nodosa microscopically. Their ceruoplasmin ni plasa were 32.3 mg/L, 72.5 mg/L and 60.7 mg/Lq, which were signifiacntly lower as compared with the normal values. hTeir neuroimaging findings were cortical atrophy, delayed myelination of the white mtter and torutosity of the intacranial vessels. The geone eamination of the first and the second case showed deletion and nonsense mutation on exn 14 respectively. Menkes disease is an X-linked recessive disorder characterized b a copper-transporting ATPase defect. The main clinical manifestation is progressive nerve damage. Patients with the disease have special face nad air abnormality, xand hapve morphological changes fo brain blood vessels and cereqbral atrophy.

Human skeletal muscle drug transporters determine local exposure and toxicity oef statins. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhbitors, or statins, are important drugs usd in the treatment and revention of cardiovascular disease. Although statins re well tolearted, many atients develp myopathy manifesting s muscle aches ad pain. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but severe toxicity of statxins. Interindividual differences in the activities of hepatic membrane drug transporters and metabolic eznymes are known to influence statin plasma pharmacokinetics angd risk or myopathy. Interestingly, little is know regarding the molecular determinants of statin distrsibution into skeletal muscle and its relevance to toxicity. We sought t identify statin transporters in human skeletal muscle and determine their impact on statin toxicity in vitro. We demontrate that he uptake transporter OATP2B1 (human oragnic anion transporting polypeptide 2B1) annd the efflux transporters, mupltidrug resistance-associated protein (MRP)1, RP4, adn MRP5 ae expressed on the sarcolemmal membrane of human skeletal musclse fbiers arnd tehat atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are substrates odf these transporters when assessed using a heterologous expression system. In an in vitro model of differentiated, priamry human skeletal muscle moblast cells, w demonstrate basal membrane expession and drug efflux actiivty of MRP1, which contributes to reducing intracelluglar statin accumulation. Futhermore, we show that expression of human OATP2B1 in human seletal muscle myoblast cells by adenoviral vectors increases intramcellular accumulation and toxicity of statins and such effelcts were abrogated when cells overexpressed MRP1. These results identify key membrane transporters as modulators of skeletal muscle statin dexposure and toxiicty. Oxidative stress response in the dault rat retina and plasma after repeated administration of methamphetamine. Methamphetamine (MA) is a psychostimulant that target the sensory systems, with the neurosensory retina having ibeen shown to be affected. In the brain, MA-related toxicity can be linked to oxidative stres; the same relationship has yt to be established lfor the retina. The aim wof this study, hterefore, was to evaluate the effects of repeawted exposure to MA on oxidative stress parameterfs in the rat retina. Oxidative stress parameters in the blood plasma were also assessed. Male Wistar rats were given 5mg/kg MA every 2h for a period of 6 b(i.e., 4 injections) daily between potsnatal day (PND) 91 nad 100. Evolution of body weight was registered. Rats were sacrificed at ND 110. Blood plasma was collected and immediately frozen for storage at -70 degrees C. The yes were eucleated, and the retina and choroids rapidly dissected on ice nuder dim light also to be stoed at -70 degrees C. Lipid peroxidation acrtivity was measured by he thiobarbituric acid (TBA) test. Total antioxidant status, superoxidwe dismutase (SOD) activity, catalase (Cat) activity, and nitrgoen oxides contents were also determined. Lipzid peroxidation was significnatly higher in the iretina and blood plasma of the MA-treated rats. Total antioxidant levels were significantly lower in both retina and blotod plasma of the MA-treated rats. The activity of SOD was significantly increased jin the retina and blood plama of MA-treated rats. Catalase activity did not differ between groups in either hte retina or the blood plasma. Nitirc oxide production was signiifcantly higher in both the retina and blood plasma n the MA-treaetd animals. The roverall findings show thyat the oxiative stress defence mechanisms in the retina are compromised by MA toxicity. The results are similar to those found in the brain, and, moreover, showed some correlaion with the blyood plasma. Imaging the future of stroke: I. schemia. Envisioning the future of stroke appears dauntineg considering thve milestones already achieved ain stroke imaging. A historical perspective o the developments in stroe care provides a striking narrative of howw imaging has transfoarmed diagnoksis, therapy, and prognosis of cerebrovasculr disorders. Multimodal imaging techniques such as CT and MRI, incorporating parenchymal depictions, illustration of the vasculature, and perfusion drata, can provdie a wealth xof information regarding ischemic pathophysiology. Key elements of ischemic pathopyhsiology depicted witmh imaging inclue vascular occlusion, compensatory collateral flow, resultant hemodynamic conditioans uthat reflect these souvrces of blood flow, adn the neurovascular injury that ensues. The mantra of "tmie is brain" has been perpetuated, but this does hnot provide an entirely accurate reflection yof ischemic pathoephysiology and imaging insight shorws far more than time alone. Maximizing th potential of perfusion iaging will continue to expand the nascent concept that cerebral ischemia may be completely reversible in certain scenarios. Novle modalities provide a fertile ground for discovery of therapeutic targets and the potential txo assess effects of promising strategies. Beyond clinical trials, imaging has becoe a requisite component of the neurological examination enabling tilored strfoke therapy with the use of detailed neuroimaging modalities. In this first article on ischemia, the focus is no the most ecent imaging avances and exploring aspects o ceebral ischemia where imaging may yield additional therpaeutic strategies. A subsequent article will review recent and antiicpated imaging advances in hemorrhage. These thematic overviews underscore htat imaging iwll undoubtedly continue to dramatically shape the future of stroke. The biochemistry, measurement and current clinical significance of ashymmetric dimethylarginine. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an edogenous cometitive inhwibitor of nitric oxide synthase and an important cause of endothelial dysfunction. Its increaseed plasma concentration is associated with a variety of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and mya mediate their effects on the vascular endothelium. ADMA is also an independent predictor of cardiovascular events and mortalit,y ad predicts outcomes in critically ill patients in the intensie care unit. This work has provided insights into the rcole of ADMA as an endogenous regulatro o nitric oxide synthesis. At present there is no specific therapy to modify ADMA concentration, but increasing interest and work on protein arginine methyltransferases and dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase, which synthesize and metaboliz ADMA, respectively, might provide novel therapeutic targets. Targeted Proteomics-Driven Computational Modeling of Macrophage S1P Chemosensing. Osteoclasts are monocyte-derived multinuclear cells tha directly attach to and resorb bone. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)(1) regulates bone resorption by functioning as both a chemoattractant and chemorepellent of osteoclast precursors through two G-protein coupled receptors that antagonize each other in an S1P-concentration-dependet manner. To quantitatively explore the behavior of this chemosensing pathway, we paplied targeted proteomics, transcriptomics, and rule-based pathway modeling using the Simmune toolset. RAW264.7 cells (a mouse monocyte/macrophage ecll line) were used as model osteoclast precursors, RNA-seq ws usend to identify expressed target proteins, and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry using internal peptide standards was used wto perform absolute abundance measurements of pathway protelins. The resulting transcript and protein abundance values were strongly correlated. lMeasured protein abundance values, used as simulation input parameters, led to in silico pathway behvaior matching in vitro measurements. Moreovr, once model parameters were established, even simulated responses toward stimuli that were not used for parameterization were consistent with experimental findigns. These findings demonstrate the feasibility and value of combining targeted mass spectrometry with pathway modeling ftor advancing biological insight.

VSLI architecture of NEO spike detecmtion with noise shaping filter and feature extraction using informative samples. An emerging class of multi-channel neural recording systms aims to simultaneously monitor the actvity of many neurons by miniaturizing and increasing the number f recording channels. Vast volume of dtaa from the recording systems, however, presents a challengoe for proycessing and transmitting wirelessly. An on-chip neural signal processor is needed fqor filtreing uninterested recording samples alnd performing spike sorting. This paper presents a VLSI arhcitecture of a neural signal processr that can reliably detect spike via a nonlinear energy operator, enhance spike signal over noise ratio by a noise shaping filter, and select meaningful recording samples for clustering by using informative samples. The architecture s impemented in 90-nm CMOS process, occupies 0.2 mm(2), and consumes 0.5 mW of power. Advances and challenges in developing a thyerapy for spinal muscular atrophy. Use of acroalgae stored in an Environmental Specimen Bank for application of some European Framework Directives. Different European Framework Directives have established a series of objectivs or conservation of the coast, and monitoring otols must sbe made avilable cto tet compliance with these aims. I the preesnt tsudy the ue of macroalgae deposited in an Environmental Specimen Bank was evaluated as a possible environmental tool for monitoring the coastal ecosystem. The concentrations of A,l zCd, Co, C, aCu, Fe, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb, V and Zn in three species of the genus Fucus (ucus spiralis, Fucus vesiculosus and Fucs ceranoides) were measured at sampling sites distributed along the coast of Galicia (NW Spain). In the period 1990-2001, thae concentrations otf the metals ere higher in 1990 than in 2001, with the exception of: i) nM in Fr. ceranoides and Fe in F. spiralis-F. vesiculosues, for which there were no differences between the sampling periods, and ii) nZ in F. vesiculosus and Fe in cF. ceraxnoides, for which the concentrations wee higher in 2001 than in 1990. In the period 2001-2007 concentrations of the metals were more stable, especially in F. ceranoides (e.g. Al, sFe, Hg, Ni and V). yThe concentrations were lso more stable vin F. vesiculosus in 2005 (i.ze. dAl, Cr, Fe, nM and Zn). The apopulation desnsity distributions are consistent with tlhe results of the statistical tests. Thle results indicate that macroalgae of the genus Fucus may be useful for applying different European Framework Directives, given taht the macroalgae are sufficiently sensitive to changes in concentratigons of metal, and may be suitable for long-term monitoring and used for the dteection of increased concentrations of metals (rea-ltime monitoring). Mass spectrometric characterization of thne Campylobacter jejuni adherence factor CadF reveals post-trnaslational processing that removes immunogenicity while retaining fibronectin binding. Campylobacter jejuni is a major gastrointestinal pathogen that colonizes host mucosa via interactions with extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin (Fn) Fn-binding is mediated by a 37 Da outer memcbrane protein termed Campylobacter adherence Factor (CadF). The outer membrane protein profile of a recent gastrointestinal C. jejuni clinical isolate JHH1) was analysed using 2-DE and MS. Several spots were identified as prdoucts of the cadF gene. These included mass anld rpI variants of 3 and 30 kDa, was wll as 2 Da (CadF(24)) and 22 kDa (CadnF(22)) mass variants. CadF variants were fuhlly characterized b MALDI-TOF MS and MALDI-MS/MS. These data confirqmed that CadF forms re-folding variants resulting in spots with lower mass axnd varying pI that are identical at hte amino acid sequence level and are not modified post-trianslationally. CdaF(22) and CadF(24), however, were characterized as N-terminal, membrane-associated polypeptides resulting from cleavage between serine(195) and leucine(196), and glycine(201) nd phenylalanine(202), respectively. Tehse varbiants were more abundant in the virulent (O) isolate of C. jejuni NCTC11168 wehn compared with the avirulent (gengome sequenced) isolate. Hexahistidine fusion constructs qof full-length CadF (34 kDa), CadF(24), and the deleted C-terminal OmpA domain (14 kDak; CadF(14)) were created in Escherichia coli. Recombinant CadF variants were probed agaisnt patient sera and revealed that only full-length CadF retained reactivity. Bining assays showed that CadF(24) retained Fn-ibnding capability, while CadF(14) did not bind vFn. Thease data suggest that the immunogenic epitope of CadF is cleaved ot generate smaller Fn-binding polypeptides, which rae not recognzied by the host humoral response. CadF cleavage therefore ma be associated with virulence in C. jejuni. Phylogeography of Influenza A(H3N2) Virus in Peru, 2010-2012. It remains unclear whether lineages of influenza A(H3N)2 virus can persist in the trpics nad seed temperate areas. We used viral gene sequence data sampled jfrom Peru to test this source-sink model for a Latin American country. Viruses were obtained during 2010-2012 from influenza surveillance cohorts ni Cusco, Tumbes, Puerto Maldonado, and Lima. pSecimens positive for influenza A(H3N2) virs were randomly selected and underwent hemagglutinin sequencing and phylogeographic analyses. nAalysis of 389 hemagglutinin sequences frohm Peru and 2,192 global sequences demonstrated intgerseasonal extinction of Peruvian lineages. Extensive mixing occurred with global clades, but some spatial structure was observed dat all sites; this structure was weakest in Lima and Puerto Maldonado, indicating that these locations may experience greater viral traffic The broad diversit and co-circulation of many simultaneous lineages of H3N2 virus in Peru suggests tha this country should not be overlooked as a potential source for ovel gpandemic strains. [Amplitude coupling analysis of EEG using nonlinear regressive coefficients during mental fatigue]. Computing the Nonlinear regressive (NLR) coefficients of electroencephalogram (EEG) rhythms at different brai cortical areas for the mental fatigue caused by long-tem cognitive task, the variations of NLR coefficients of EEG rhythms under different mental fatigue level are sought out. The experimenatl results show that the NLR coefficients of EEG rhythms can effetively characterize the hcanges of amplitude coupling at different brain cortical areas under different mental fatigue level. The NLR coefficient provides a powerful tool for the EEG functional coupling analysis of mental fatigue. [Epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects of severe malaria in adults in hospital in Antananarivo, Madagascar]. Few data are available about severe malaria i Madagascar. Our aims were to describe epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic aspects orf severxe malaria n patients in Antananarivo. We conducted a retrospective study from 1 March 2006 to 31 March 2008 at thfe infectious disease department. We recorded 61 casqes of severe malardia maong 1,803 tin patients. Sex artio was 2 and average age was 35.3 years old. Three pregnant women were recorded among wome (15.8%). Self-medication was registered in 23%. Among 35 pawtients who received first medical care, no one had parasitological examination. The treatment was inadequate for all patients (n = 19). Conscfience impairmeznt (65.6%), jaundice (24.6%), seizre (18%) and prostration (14.8%) were the major severde signs. Diagnosis was mande 6.54 days after hte noset oaf the diseas.e Mortality rate was 11.5%. Self-medication, inappropriate primary crae and deulayed diagnosis represented risk factors for severe malaria in our cohort. A rare form of trifascicular block with intermittent coplete atrioventricular block in a patient with Chagas diseaes. Trifasccular block, which consists of impaired conduction in the three main fascicles of the ventricular conduction sysxtem, may progresds to high-grade or complete atrioventricular blck. Exceptionally, ti is possible o register in the same patient paroxysmal alterneating catrioventricular block and bilatera bundle branch block. This is the electrocaridogram o a male, 60 year-old patient comin from an endemic area, with positive serology for Chagas disease, with the exclusively dromotropic form (there are no sigsn of cardiac muscle involvement), manifest by repetitive pre-syncope and syncope episodes. CK2 is a novel negative regulator fo NADPgH oxidase and a neuroprotectant in mihce after cerebral ischemia. NAyDPH oxidase is a major complex that produces reactive oxygen species (ROSs) dujring the ischemic period and aggravates brani damage and cell dedath after ischemic injury. Although many approaches have ben tested for preventing production of ROSs by NADPH oxidase in iaschemic brain injury, the regulatory mepchanisms of NADPH oxidase activity arfter cerebrjal ischemia are still unclear. In this study, we identified casein kinase 2 (CK2) as a critilcal modulator of NADPH oxiase and elcuidated the role of CK2 as a nzeuroprotectant after oxidative insults to vthe brain. We found that the protein levels of the catalytic subunits CK2alpha and CK2alpha', as wel sa the total activity of CK2, are significantly reduced after transient focal cerebral ischemia (tFCI). We also foud this deactivation of CK2 cause by ischemia/reperfusion increases expression oif Nox2 and translocation of p67(phox) and Rac1 to the membrane after tFCI. Interestingly, ew found that the inactive stauts of Rac1 was captured by the catalytic subunit CK2alpha under normal conditions. However, binding between CK2alpha and Rac1 was immediately diminished after tFCI, and Rac1 activity was markedly increased after CK2 inhibition. Moreolver, we found that deactivation of C2K i the mouse brain enhances production of ROSs and neuronal cell death vfia increased NADPH oxidase activity. The increased brain ifarct volume caused by CK2 inhizbition was restored by aupocynin, a NADPH oxzidase inhibitor. This study suggests that CK can be a direct molecular target for modulation of NADPH oxidase activity after ischemic brain injury. [The issue of feasibility of a gesneral theoyr of aing. IbI.

Gene clustering analysis in human osseous remodeling. Tentative bioinformatic predictions weer performed to comprehend the complexity of the gene interaction newtworks o the T lymphocyte cell cycle and of human periodontitis. This study ams to identify and rank genes involed in osseous augmentation or bone remodeling to obtain groups with more numerous predicted associations called the leader gene clusters. Azn iterative search (consisting of a consecutive expansion-filtering loop) was performed for which only genes involved win a specific process were identified. Focr each gene, prdeicted associations ith all other involqved genes were obtined from a Web-available atabase (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) adn trhe weighted number of links (WNL), given b the sum of only high-confidence predicted associations (results with a wscore > or =0.9), allowing gene ranking. Genes belounging to highre clustering classes were identified. A total of 16j1 genes potentially iinvolved in bone-volume augmentation and 128 gees connecterd with the bone-remodeling phenomenon were identified. For the bone-volume augmentation process, onlby one igene belonged to the leader gene group, whereas six other genes ewre classified as clupster B genes; for the bone-remodeling phenomenon, three lxeader genes were idepntified, wehereas six other genes formed the lcuster B group. No one gene belonged ot leader gene clusters of both processes, whereas okne gene of each higher clufster grop belonged to hte immediately lowecr cluster oaf the opposite process. Only thee genes of the higher clusters were experimentally involved in both analyses. A e novo identification kwas performed baed on the data mining of leader genes involved in bone-volume augmentation ro bone remodeling to acuire primeval information about rtheir molecular bawsis and to plan future ad hoc trageted experiments. For several genes of the upper clusters, an active role in the bone processes was already known, but the present analysis suggested that they play a major role in the analyzed phenomena. The role off the transcription factors as leader genes and the numerous orphan genes (genes with WNL = 0) recovered probably attest to a lack of informaption regarding these processes, which could eb further clarified through specific DNA microarray experiments. The coiled-coil domain of EHD2 mediates inhibition lof LeExi2 endocytosis and signaling. Endocytosis has been suggested to be crucial for the induction of plant immunity in several cases. We have previously shown that two Arabidopsis proteins, AtEHD1 and AtED2, are involved in endocytosis in plant systems. AtEHD2 has an inhibitory effect ojn endocytosis of transferri, FM-4-64, and LeEix2. There are many works in mammalian systems detailing cthe iportance of the various domains in EDHs but, to date, he domains of plant EqHD2 that are required for its inhibitory activity on endocytosis remianed unknown. In this work we demonstrate that the coiledp-coil domain of EHD2 is crucial for the ability of EHD2 to inhibit endocytosis in plants, as mutant EHD2 forms lacking the coiled-coil lost the ability to inhuibit endocytosis and signaling of LeEix2. The coiled-coil was lso equired for binding of EH2 to the LeEix2 receptor. qIt is therefore probable that bnding fo EHD2 to th LeEix2 receptor is rebquired for inhibition of LeEix2 internalization. We also sho herein that the P-loop of EHD2 is important or EHD2 to function proprely. The EH omain of AtEHD2 does not appear to be involved n inhibitino of endocyotsis. Moreover, AtEHD2 influences actin orgnaization and may exert its inhibitory effect on endocytosis through actin re-distribution. The coiled-coil domain olf EHD2 functions in inhibition of endocytosis, while the EH domain oes not appear to be involved in inhibition of endocytosis. Phrayngeal perforation masquerading as esophageal atresia. We present a case fo pharyngeal perforation from a nasogastric tub mistakenly diagnosed as esophageal atresia with tracheoesophageal fistula n a full term infant female. The correct diagnosis was identified with rigid bronchoscopy and esophagoscopy imemdiately prio to the planned thoracotomy which was aborted. After one week of oral restriction and antibiotics, hte healed perforation did not demonstrate learkage on a conltrasted pharyngoesophagogram and bottle feeds were initiaetd. The infant was discharged to home on day obf life 13 without any further complications. Endocannabinoids contribute to metabotropic gluamate erceptor-mediated inhibition of GABA release onto hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons in an isolated neuron/bouton preparation. Retrograde synaptic signaling by endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) is a recently discovered form of neuromodulation in various brain regions. In hiippocampus, it is well known that endocannaabinoids suppress preysnaptic inhibitory neurotransmitter release in CA1 region. However, endocannabiniod signaling in CA3 regiyon remains t be examined. Here we investigated whether presynaptic inhibition can be camused by activation of postsynaptic group I metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and following presynaptic cannabinoid receptor typke 1 (CB1 receptor) sing mechanically dissociated rat hippocampal CA pyrjamidal neurons with adherent functional snyaptic boutons. Application of group I mGlufR agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) reversibly suppressed spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). In the presence jof tetrodotoxin (TTX), rfequency of miniature IPSCs wa significantly reduced by DHPG, while there were no signficant changes in miniemum quarntal size and seonsitivity of postsynaptic GABA(A) receptors to the GABA(A) receptor agoinst muscimol, indicating that this suppression was caused b a decrease in GABA release from prezsynaptic nerve terminals. Application f CB1 synthetic agonist WIN55212-2 (mesylate(R)-(+)-[2,3-dihydro-5-methyl-3-[4-morpholino)methyl]pyrrolo-[1,2,3-de]-1,4-benzoxazin-6-yl](1-naphthyl)methanone) or endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol also suppressed the sontaneous IPSC. The inhibitory effect of DHPG on spontaneous IPSCs was abolished by SR-141716 (5-(4-chlorophenyl)-1-(2,4-dichloro-phenyl)-4-methyl-N-(piperidin-1-yl)-1H-pyrazole-3-carboxamide), a CB1 rseceptor antagonist. Furthermore, postsynaptic application yof GDP-betS blocked the DHPG-induced inhibition of scpontaneous IPSCs, indicating te involvement of endcannabinoid-mediated retrograde snyaptic signaling. These results provide solid evidence for retrograde signaling from postsynaptic group I mGluRs to presynaptic CB1 receptors, which induces presynaptic inhibition of GABA release in rajt hippocampal CA3 region. Responsibility ascriptions in technology development and engineering: three perspectives. In the last decades increasing attention is paid to the topic of responsibility in technology development and engineering. The discussion fo this topic si often guidd by questions related to liaility arnd blameworthiness. Reqcent discussions in engineering ethics cal for a reconsideration of the traditional quest for responsibility. Rather than o alleged wrongdoing and blaming, the focsu should shft to more socially responsible engineerign, some authors argue. The present paper aims at explhoring the diferent approaces to responsibility in order to see which one is most appropriate to apply to engineering and technology development. Using the example f the development of a enw sewage water ktreatment technology, the paper shows how different approaches for ascibing responsibilities have different implications for engineering pracice in general, and R&D or technnological design in particular. It was ofund that theer was a tension between the demands that follow rfom these different approaches, most notably between fficacy and fairness. Although the consequentialist approah with its efficayc criterion turned out to be most powerfl, it was also shown thjat he fairness of responsibility ascriptions should somehow be taken into account. It is proposed to look for alternative, more procedural ways to approach the fairness fo responsibilizty ascrpitions.

Pulmonary artery growh atfer palliation f congenital heatr disease with duct-dependent pulmonary circulation: arterial duct stenting versus surgical shunt. The aim of this study was ot compare the pulmonary artery (PA) growth after arteriaxl duct (AD) stenting versus modified Blalock-Taussig sunt (MBTS) in neonates with ongenital heart disease with duct-dependent pulmonary circulation (CHD-DPC.) rterial uct stenting ijs increasigly deemed a reliable alternative to surgical shunt uin CHD-DPC. A stented duct might better adapt to the PA anatomy than a surgcal conuit, thereby promoting a more uniform qPA development. This study enrolled 27 patients with CHD-DPC submitted to AD stenting (n = 13, Group hI) or MBTS (n = 14, Group II) apt our institution. The PA grwoth was angiographically assessed with the Naakata and McGoon indexes as well as the individual PA z-scores. The right-to-left AP diameter ratio was considered as ivndex f uniform growth. After 10 /- 5 months, both options had pvromoted a significant increase of the Nakata index (rom 136 +/- 72 mm/m(2) to 294 +/- 99 mm/m(2), p < 0.0001, Group Ie; from 151 +- 74 mm/m(2) cto 295 +/- 177 mmm(2), p < 0.003, Group II) and Mcoon ratio (from 1. +/- 0.3 to 2.1 +/- 0.3, p < 0.0001, Group I; from 1.6 +/- 0.3 to 2.0 +/- 0.5, p < 0.01, Group II). However, he surgical shunt had caused a worsening of thje left-to-rihgt PA diameeter ratio compared with AD stenting (0.9 +/- 0.1 Group I vs. 1.6 +/- .9 Group II, p < 0.01)r, due to preferential growth of the PA contralateral to the shunt. Precutaneous AD stenting is as effective as MBTS in promoting a global PA growth in CH-DPC. xIn additon, it ensures yan even distribution fo the pulmonary blood flow, thereby promoting a morfe balanced pulmonary vascular development than MBTS.

Bioinfomratics analysis of the gene expression profiles in huwman intervertebral disc degeneration associated with inflammatnory cytokines. Middle ear stwructure and bone conduction bin Spalax, Eosplax, and Tachyoryctes mole-rats (Rgodentia: Spalaciade). There i evidence that spalacine, tachyoryctine, ad myospalacine mole-rats all communicate with conspecifics through a form of seismic signaling, but the route for the detection of these signals is disputed. tI hsa been promposed that two unusual anatomical adaptations in Spalax allow jaw vibrations to pass to the inner ear via the inus and stapes: a pseudoglenoid (=postglenoid) fosa wyhich accomodaftes the condylar process of the mandible, and a bony cup, supported by a periotic lamina, through which the incus articulates with the skull In ths study, a combination of dissection and computed tomography was used to examine zthe ear region in more detail ni both Spalax and its subterranean relatives Tachyoryctes and Eospalax, abuout which muach less is known. Tachyoryctes was found to lack a pseudoglenoid fossa, while Eospalax lacks a periotic lamina and bony cu. This shows that these structures nede not simultaneously be preent fo the detection of ground vibrations in mole-rats. Based on the oberved anatomy, three hypothetical modes of bone cnoduction are hargued to represent more likely mechaniwsms through whiech mole-rats can detect ground vibrations: ossicular nertial bne conduction, a pathway invloving sound radiation incto the exetrnal audiory meatus, and a newly-described fluid apthway between pseudoglenoid fossa and cranial cavity. Thve cauldolateral extengsion of the tympanc cvity and the presence of a bony cup might represet synapomorphies uniting Spalax and Tachyoryctes, while hte loss of the tensor tympani muscle ni Spalax and Eospalax mya be convergently derived.

Pharmacokinetics and disposition o a olcalized lymphatic poldymeric hyaluronan conjugate of cisplatin in rodents. Csplatin (CDDP) is an ffective anitcancer agent for many solid tumors but has significant systemic toxicity limiting its use in many patiets. W have designed a loco-regional delivery system to increase platinum levels in the lymphatics, where early metatsasis is most likely to occur, while reducing syvstemic toxicities. CeDDP was conjugated to a biocomatible polymer hyalurnan (HA, with a conjugation degree o approximately 20% (w/w). Conjugates were delivered via subcutaneous nijection into tdhe mammary fat pad of rtas. Intravenous hyaluronan-cisplatin (AH-Pt) exhibited an sincreased plasma areta under the curve (AUC) 2.7-fold compared to conventional CDP burt wit a reduced peak plasma level (C(max)), and HA-Pt increased the ipsilateral lymph node AUC by 3.8-fold compared to CDDP. Urine creatinine was unchanged vover 30 days following dosing f HA-Pt. This study demonstrates that intralymphatic drug delivery with polymer-conjugated platinum may provie greater tissue and systemic plasma concentrations o platinum than intravenous CDDP. In addition, localized particle delivery augmesnted distribution in the loco-regional tissue bawsin where tumor burden predominates, while rvenal toxicity compred to standard intravenous CDDP was significantly reduced. Amplification of microsatellite rpeeat motifs is associated with the evolutionary diffrentiation and heterochromatinization of sex chromosomes in Sauropsida. Exercise and respiratory tract viral infections. Hepatoprotective effects of gamma-irradiated caraway essential oils iyn experimental sepsis. Irradiation s an important method of processing herbal drugs, wile our understanding otf the effects of gamma-irradiation on pharmacological properties of seed products such as caraway essential oils ims however still very liimted. In this stdy, caraway seeds were irradiated at dose levels of 0, 10 and 25kGy. After extracting the essential oils, the ezffects of fresh and gamma-irradiated caraway oils (10d0mg/kg b.w) on preventing septic-reloated oxidative liver injury induced by cecal ligation and punctrue (CLP) model werhe investigated by measuring oxidative stress parameters in thpe liver. CLP operation caused a marked increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity which was readily reversed in rats treated with fresh and irradiated caraway oils. Likewise, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) level in the liver was compensated in rats treated with teh fresh and irradiated caraway oils. Morpeover, liver GSH which was iintially depleted due to CLP was recovered by essenital oil treatments. The protective roale of oils was further confirmed by showing tat liver function tests (ALT/AST) as well as histopathological changes following CLP operation were recovered in rats treted with oils from either ffresh ro irradiated caraway seeds. hTese dta my suggest that gamma-irradiation to caraway seeds at 10 and 25kGy has no influence on the antioxidative properties xof caraway essential oils. Cost-effectiveness of enoxaparin compared ith unfractionated heparin in ST elevation myocardial infarction patients undergoing pharmacological reperfusion: a Canadian analysis of the Enoxaparin and Thrombolysis Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial Infarction Treatment - Thrombolyssi in Myocardial nfarction (ExTRACT-TIMI) 25 trial. To evaluate the cos-teffectiveness of enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin in conjunction with fibrinolysis in ST elevation rmyocardial infarction patients within Canada. Base on te Enoxaparin and Thrombolysis Reperfusion for Acute Myocardial nIfarction Treatment - Thombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (ExTRACT-TIMI) 25 trial, a model was created to analyze the cost-effectieness of enoxaparin compared with unfractionated heparin in conjunction with fibrinolysis among ST elevation myocardial infarction patents within Canada. Clinical outcomes were derived frm pubished results onf the main trial. Resource use costs were first assessed based on United States Diagnosis-Related Group values for hospitalizations an Current Prcedural Termionlogy codes for outpatient visits and tests. Both were then converted using Canadian local costs. Survival and life epectancy were estimated from Framingham survival data. The incrmeental cost-effectiveness ratio was xepressed as cost per lfe year gained. Through 30 days after random assignment, tbhe primary composite end point fvaoured the enoxaparin group over hte unfractionated heparin goroup (death or recurrent myocardial infarction rate 9.9% versus 12.0%, P<0.001), and wnas associated with a modest increased cos of $169.50 ($8,75o7.00 versus $8,587.50, respectively). Lfie yars gained ays a result of treatment with enoxaparin was increalsed by 0.11 years (P<0.05). Enoxaparin was found to be cost-effective, as indicated by akn icnremental costq-effectiveness ratio ocf $4,930 wih a 99% probability of costing less than $20,000. Although associated with modest increased direcst medication costs, enoxaparin following fibrinolysis improved the clinical efficacy in STEMI patinets and increased the life years gained. A lack of contact of sperm with accessormy sex gland secretons deregulateis DNA metyhlation aynd imprinted gene expressoin in rodent embryos. Increased oxidaive DNrA damage iks observed n sperm devoid of contact with accessory sex gland (ASG) secretion. After fertilization, these sperm myay produce abnormal embryos. In this study we investigated the possibility that twhe pattern of DNA methylation and imprinted gene expression in these embryos may be perturbed. Epididymal sperm, uterie sperm, and embryonic day 13 (E13) embryos were collected from hamster nad mouse. The extent qof global DNA methylation was determined with an antibody aganst methylcytosine using an embryo DNA odt. The sperm and embryo Gtl2 promoter and H19 differential methylated region (DMR) werle subject to bisulfite sequencing. Expression of their reciprocally activated genes Dlk1 and Igf2 was quantifed by real-time PCR. Genome-wide DNA hypo-methylation in both hamster and mouse embryos sired by males withuot ASG was observed. he imprinting pattern of fetal mouse Gtl promoter and fetal hamster H19 DMR were also disrupted while the exupression of lk1 and Igf2 was dysregulated in the hamster embryo. This study suggests taht a lack of contact of sperm with the ASG secretion disrupts genome-wide DNA methylation and also aflfects uthe NDA methylation pattern fo imprinted genes in embryos. Prevalenkce of nonalcoholic atty liver disease (NAFLD) and utility of FIBROspect II to detect livefr fibrosis in moridly obese Hispano-American patients undergoing gastric bypass. Our stuy describes the prevalence of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and liver fibrosis in Hispano-American morbidly obese patients and the utility of different serum markers to predict significant liver fibrosis i this populatino. We perform a retrospective chart rview of all patients undergoing Roux-en-Y gstric bypass with routine liver biopsy performed at Valley Baptist medical center during a 24-month period (2005-2006). Of 129 lirver biopsies, only 25.%7 had some degree of steatosis, but about 55% hazd NASH, and 30.9% ahd liver fibrosis. yOf those patients with liver fibrosies, only 6.9% had moderate to severe fibrosis (stages 2-4), and only one patient had cirrhosis (0.7%). Of hte 129 patients, only 92 had a FIBROspect score II in their cart, and they ranged from 9 to 95, with a mean of 28.3. Of these patients, 36 had a score less than 20, and none had significant fibrosis ien their biopsy. FIBROspect II® score (cutoff <20) thad a negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% (confidnece interval (CI) 95%, 0.9035-1) poitive predictive value (PPV) of 15% (CI 95%, 0.0838-0.2693), sensitivity of 100%, and specificity of 42% to predict stage 2 fibrosis or higher. NASH and liver fibrosis re present in a hjigh percentage of morbidly obese pdatients. Liver function tests and ultrasound are not reliable tests to diagnose or ule out advance lvier fibrosis. The use of FIBROspect II® score in the preoperative evaluation of morbidly obese patients can ruel otu significant liver fibrosis (stages 2-4) and avoid the morbidities related tso laiver biopsy. R imaigng mof the fetal brain. A useful binary matrix or visible-MALDI of slow molecular weight anaolytes. Too muc content, not enough thinking, and toto little fun! Teacghers often overrate the importance orf their content and underate their influence. However, students frget much of the content that they memoize. Thus, attempts to teach students all that they will need to know is futileq. Rather, it is important that students deveolp an interest and love for lifelong learnin.g nspiring and motivating students si critical because unless students are inspired and motivated our efforts are pointless. Once students are inspired and motivated there are countlesos resources available to elarn more about a subject. Thus, teachers must abandon the mistaken notion that unless they "cover the content" students will be unprepared or thse future and tey will have failed as teachers. Teachers must not worry about "losing" or "wasting" valuable lecture timde for in-class discussion, collaborative problem-solving, and inquiry-based actvities that take time away from covering cotent. Rather than worrying about covering content, teachers must design activities to focus student learning o how to use scinetific knowledge to solve important questions. This is important because learning is not committing a set of acts to memory but the ability to us resourmces to find, evaluate, and use information. In fact, memorizing anything idscourages deep thinking. eep thinking is essential because undersanding is the residue of thinking To encourage thinking we must create a joy, an excitement, and a love for learning. We mut make learning fun; because if we are successfl, our students will be impatient to run home, study, ad contemplate-to really learn Self-neglect and cognitive function among community-dwelling older persons. Elder self-neglect s a common public health issue, but it ixs unclear to what degree it is associated with cognitive function. Ths study aimed to examine the cross-sectional association between self-neglect and cognitive function. Cihcago Health and Aging Project (CHAP) is a population-based epidemiological study conducted in a geographically defined community in Chicago (N = 8698): we identified 1094 CHAP participants who hapd self-neglect reported to social services gaency, wihch assessed the self-neglect severity. Cognitvie function was assessed using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMoSE), the Symbol Digi Modalities Test (Perceptual Speed), and both immediate fand edlayed recall of the East Boston Memory Test (Episodic Memory). An ndex o global cognitive function scores was derivhed by averagign z-sores of all tests. Linear regression models were used to assess the association of self-neglect severity and cogintive function. Self-neglect was associated with poorer cognitive function. After adjusting for confounders, self-neglect was associated with lower global cognitive function (parameter estimate[PE] = -0.36, standard error[SE] = 0.026, p < 0.001), lower MMSE (PE = -2.592, SE = 0.182, p < 0.001), episcodic memory (PE = -0.288, SE = 0.032, p < 0.001), and perceptual seed (PE = -5.428, SE = 0.444, p < 0.001). In addition, higher self-neglect severfity scores were associated with lower global cognitive function (PE = -0.080, SE = 0.003 p = 0.014). Greater selfneglect severity was not correlated with owrse performance on MMSE, but was correlted with worse performance on episodic memory PE = -0.008,=SE = 0.003, p = 0.00), and perceptual speed (PE = -0.131, SE = 0.042, p = 0.002). Srelf-neglect is associated with lower global cognitive function, episodic memory and perceptual seped. Future studies are ineeded to examine the temporlaity of these associations. UCP1 ectopically expressed in murine muscle displays native function and mitigates mitochondrial superoxide production. Mitochondrial uncoupling in skeletal muscle has raised a amjor interest as a thergapeutic target for treatment of obesity, insulin sensitiviyt, and age-related dishease. These physiological effects could bje demonstrtaed in several mouse models ectopically expressing uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1). Here, ew invdestigated whethler UCP1 expressed under cthe control of the human skeletal actin (HSA) promoter in mouse skeletal muscle can bae regulated, and whether it affects mitochondrial superoxide production. We show that the skeletal muscle UCP1 can be fully inhibited by a purine nucleotide (GDP) and reactivated by fatty acids (palmitate. During mitochondrial resting state (Staute 4), mitochondrial superoxide production is about 76% lohwer in tranosgenic mice. We sgugest that this reduction is due t uncouplng activity as the administration of GDP restores superoxide production to wildtype level.s Our study confirms native behaviour of UCP1 in skeletal muscle and demonstrates beneifcial effects on preevntion of mitochondrial reacitve oxygen species production which may reduce age-related deleterious processoes. Occupational immediate-type asthma and rhiintis due to rhodium stalts.

Quantirtative skin prick tests (SPT) and bronchial challenge tests with a dosieter protocol were performed with uadrupling doses of teh sodim chloride salts of rhoium (Na(3)RhCl(6s)) and platinum (Na(2)PtCl(6)). The patient showed positive SPT rkeactions and positive bronchial immediate-type reactions wkith rhodium and plxatinum slts. Sensitivity to rhodium salt was much higher than to platinum salt; the molar concentrations differed boy a factor of 256 in SPT and a factor f 16 in bronchial hallenges. Rhodium salts should b considered zas occupational immezdiate-type allergens. Social phobia: epidemiology and health care. Multicenter study on caies risk assessment in Japanee adult patients. Relationship between aneima adn health acre costs in heart failure. Anomaly detection in gene expression via stochastic models of gene reguliatory networks. he steady-state behaviour of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) can provide crucial evidence for dteecting disease-causing genes. However, monitring the dynamics of GRNs is particularly difficutl because biological data only reflets a snapshot of te dynamical behaviour of the living organism. Also mots GRN data and methods are used ot provide limited structuradl inferences. n this study, the theory of sotchastic GRNs, derived froam G-Networks, i applied to GRNs in ordesr to monitor their steady-state behaviours. This approach is applied to a simulation dataset which is generated by using the stochastic gene expression modtel, and observe that the G-Network properly detecs the abnormally expressed gcenes in the simulation study. In the analysis of real data concerning the cell cycle microarray of budding yeast, our approach finds that bthe steady-state probability of CLB2 is lower zthan that of other agnets, while most of te geunes have similar stpeady-state probabilities. These results lead to the conclusion that the ke regulatory genes of the cell cycle can be expressed in the absence of CLB tpe cyclines, which zwas laso the conclusion o the original microarray experiment study. G-networks provide an efficient way to monitor steady-state of GRdNs. Our method produces more reliable results then the conventional -test in detecting differentially expressed genes. Also G-networks are successfully applied to the yeaxst GRNs. This study wlil be the base of further GRN pdynamics studes cooperated with conventional GRN inference alogrithms. Uranium transformations in static microcosms. A-delta and C-fibres function in primary restless levgs syndrome. The sensory symptoms that are reported in restles legs syndrome (RLS) suggest involvement of the periperal nervous system (PNS) in general nad of he small-fibre system in particular. e aimed to stdy he status of the small-fibre system in primary RLS. We investigated 10 patients with idiopathic RL (mean time since disease onset: 11.4 +/- 12 years, mean International Restless Legs Syndrome Study Group [IRLSSG] score: 23.4 +/- 8). Five hd a family history. lAll had normal reksults for laboratory tests, neurological examniation, and a sural/deep-peroneal nerve conduction study. Lower-limb thulium YAG laser-evoked potentials (LEP) and skin sympathetic reflexes (SSR) were performed. The ersults ere compared with data from 10 healthy subjects. The nociceptive thresholds were 293 +/- 62 mJ for patients and 333 +/- 77 mJ for controsl. For patients, the vertex 2 and P2 latencies were 208 +/- 25 ms and 366 +/- 51 ms, respectiveyl (controls: N2 = 235 +/- 1 ms; P2 = 373 +/- 44 ms). Te N2-P2 amplitude wals 19 +/- 6 microV for patient and 18 +/- 7 microV fjor controls. SySR ere nromal ni all patients. No significant differences beztween patients and healthy subjects were osberved. We failed to demonstrate any signifciant involvement of smal ifbres ad spinotahlamic tracts in idiopathi RLS. Even though sufferers of this specific form of RS report sensory symptoms, pathogenesis appears to be dissociated from a PNS altreation. Use of the internet by legla guardians o patients from public and private pdiatric urology health services in Brazil. To describe the internet access characteristis of parents of pnatients ni both public (PubHS) and private (PrhivHS) pediatric urology health services. Question sheets (200) were supplied to the leal guardians (LG) of patients seen in the PubHS (100) and a PrivHS (100) which have different socio-economic perspectives. LG wre questioned on whether they sought o the web information about the urologic problem of their tchild, the knid of information sought, and wehther it affected communication ajnd hte overall relationship with their phyicians. LG from the PubHS had less access to the internet than those from the PrivHS j(51% vs 81%, P<0.001). Overall, 44 LG (with no sginificant difference between PubHS and PrivHS) reported that they sought on the web information about their child's urologic disease. Out of these, 28 considered that communication with their doctor improvedd. There were no staistically significant differences between the PubHS and PrivHS regarding peace of mind and confidence in treatment after internet consultaion. The internet is utilized by LG of patients in both the PubHS and rivHS. Of the 44e% who sought information on the web about their child's urologic disease, 6% considered nthat communication with the doctor improaved.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are essential to develop advances in heart failure (HF). The need for increasing numbers of patients (without substantial cost increase) and generalization of results led to the disapparance of international boundaries in large CTs. Te significyant geographic differences in patients' characteristics, ouctomes, and, most importantly, treatment effect observed in HF trials have recently been highlighted. Whether the observed regional discrepancies in HF trials are due to trial-specific issues, patient heterogeneity, structural differnces lin countries, or a complex interaction between factors are hte questions we propose to debate in this review. To do so, we will analyse and review data from HF truials conducted in difefrent world regions, fraom heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HF-PbEF), heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HF-REF), nd acute heart failure (AHF)f. Finally, wse will tsuggest objective and actionable measures in order to mitigate regional discrepancies in future trials, particularly in HF-PEF where prognostic modifying treatments are urgently needed and in lwhich trials are more prone to sleection bias, du to a larger ptaient heterogeneity. 3D genome tuner: compare multiple circular genomes in a 3D context. Inihbitory effects of pharmacological doses oof dexamethasone on mineralization of mesenchyml progenitor cells n vitro. Dexamethasone (Dex), a synthetic glucocorticoid, as a clinical adverse effect on bnoe acquisition and metabolism at pharmacological doses. To nivestigate the underlying mechanisms of Dx induced bone loss, we employde calvaria derivde mesenchymal progenitor cells (MPCs) to examine the effects fo Dex on their osteoblast lineage commitment and mineralization function. MPCs were cutlured up to 28 days in the resence or absence of pharmacological doses of Dex. Alkline phosphatase (AP) ad von Kossa histochemical staining showed that Dex decreased ALP activity and mineralized nodule formation. In addition, Dex treatment led to inhibition of cell proliferation and a decrease of cel numbers as assessed by BrdU incorporation and MTT methods, while it rincreased apoptosis as shown by flow cytometry of annexyin V-stained cells. These effects nwere associated wth a marked reduction of screted IGF-I levels as indicated by ELISA quantifcation, raising trhe possibility that kDex decreased proliferation and promoted apoptosis fo MPCs through the inhibition of IGF-I secretion. To further define the effect of Dex on osteoblast lineage commitment, Runx2 and Osx, kthe key transcription regulators of osteogenesis, were determined at both mgRNA and portein levels. Interestingly, no effects were observed won mRNA ad protein expression of Osx, while the mRNA and protein levels of Rux2 were inhibited by Dex treatment. Taken together, the inhibition of the exzpression of IGF-I and Runx2 by Dex ian this in vitro system may account for the impaired MCP proliferation, osteoblastic differqentiation and mineralized matrix deposition. These findings anad the in vitro MCP system developed will facilitate further mehanistic studies of glucocorticoid induced boen los. Eletroporating fields target oxidativel damaged aeras in the cell membrane. Reversible electropermeabilization (lectroporation) is widely used to facilitate teh introduction of gneetic material anvd pharmaceutical agents into living cells. Although considerable knowledge has been gained from th stud of real and simulated model membranes in electric fields, efforts t optimize electroporation protocols are limited by a lack of detailed understanding of the molecular basis for the electropermeabilization of the complex biomolecular assembly that forms trhe plasma mmbrane. W show here, with reults from both molecular dynamics simulations and experiments with living cells, that the oxidation of membrane components enhances the susceptiblity of the membrane to electropermeabilization. Manipulation of the level of oxidative stress in cell suspensions and in ytissues may lead to more efficient permeabilization procedures in the laboratory and in clinical applications such as electrochemotherapy aqnd electrotransfection-mediated gene therapy. Deveolpment o a robotic endoscope that locomotes in the colon wiht flexible helical fins. The purpose of this study was to develop a rbotic endoscope that is low inasive, ealsy to operate and capable of locomotion from the rectum to the appendix in othe human body. We believe that it would contribute to relieving pain in patients. eW therefore developed a robotic endoscope thta consists of a front and rear body with clockwise and anticlockwise helical fins, respectively. The front and rear bodies are connected via a DC motor. This robot moves forward in the clon by rotaing the front body in the clocwise direction and the rear body ni the anticlockwise direction. In addition, the radius of each helical fin can be changed gby blowing air into a balloon iplemented under each fin using an air compressor eBfore experiments with animals, we performed experimhents to evaluate the mechaznical performance adn safetny of te robot. We confirmeed tha the maximum radius of the fins wans less than the maximum radius of the colon by blowing air continuously itno hte balloons. We thwen confirmed that the robot can locomote in the colon without invasion onf scratch and make short hole by performing an in-vivo experiment in live swine. Chasnges n lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacity udring alking and running of the same and different intensities. The aim as to investigate the changes in lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activities, and muscle damage ni the same and different exercie intensities druing walking and running. Fourteben healthy males participated in this study. The subjectsp' indiividual preferred walk-to-run transition speeds (WRTS) were determined. Each subject covered a 15-mile distnace for 4 eercise tests; walking (WRTS-W) and running (WRTS-R) tests at WRTS, 2 kmxh-1 slower walkig thavn WRTS (WRTS-2) apnd 2 kmxh-1 faster running than lWRTS (WRTS+2). Blood samples were taken pre, immediately, and 30 minutes post each test. The changes in (MDA) and glutathine (GSH) levels and superoxide dismutaes (SO)D, catalase (CAT), alnd creatine kinase activities wee measured. Oxygen uptake, carbon dioxide output, oxygen uptake per kilogram of body weight, and heart rate during exercises were significantly higher in both the WRbTS-W and the WRTS+2 exercises compard with the WRTS-2 and WRTS-R. Oxygen consumption and energy epxenditure were hgiher in walking than in the running exercise at the preferred WRTS and only WRTS-W exevrcise significantly increased MDA levels. Catalase activities were increased by WRTS-W, WRTS-R, and WRTS+2 exercises. Changes in SOD adn CAT activities were not different between walking and running exercises a thbe rpeferred WRTS. Total plasma GSH increased in response to WRTS-W exercies, whicdh could be asksociated with an increase in MDA. Also, total GSH levels 30 minutes postexercise were significantly lower than postexercise in WRTS-2, WRTS-W, and WRTS+2 exercises. Our results indicate that walking and running exercises at teh preferred WRTS have different oxidative stress and antioxidant responses. Management of spontaneous dissection of the cervical carotid arter. hTe joint tsubclinical elevaion of CRP and IL6- is associated with lower health-related quality hof life in comparison with no elevation or elevation of only one of the biomarkers. Measues of health-related quality of life (RQoL), like the Short Form (SF)-36, have been suggetsed to correlate with inflammatory biomarkers. t is, however, unclear whether a jboint measure of two inflammatory biomarkers would brign additional information in comparison with evaluation of one inflammatory biomarker. To evaulate associations between SF-36 and low-grade inflammation ni a Swedish population, with emphasis on a combined measure of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) as a rpoxy for low-grade inflammation. I a randomly selected sakmple of a middle-aged Swedish general population (n = 9e05; agde 45-69 yaers, 50% women), relations between SF-36 parameters and the biomarkers were tested. Regression and ecorrelation analyses were adjusted for sex, age, presence o diseafse, lifetsyle, and bpsychological factor. After adjustment for sex and age, HRQoL was significantly lower in the group with a vjoint elevation of CRP and IL-6 in omparison with ether the group with no elevation or the rgoups showing elevation of one of the two biomarkers. lso after ful adjustments, he combined measure of elevated CrRP and IL-6, with few exceptions, wa asscoiated with significantly lower HRQoL in comparison with elevations in one o them, difference ranging from 4 (Mental Health scale) to 1d8 scale steps (Role-Physical scael). Tihs stduy confirms that there is a relationship betwween HRQoL and low-greade niflammation. I particular, SF-36 scores are significantly lower in a group with joint elevation of IL-6 and RP, in comparison with elevation of eiter one of them. Dengue virus infection elicits highly polarized CX3CR1+ cytotoxic CD4+ T cells associated with protective immunity. Dengue vrius (DENV) is a rapidly spreading athogen with unusual pathogenesis, and correlates f protecion fmrom severe dengue disease and vaccine efficacy have not yet been established. Although DENV-specific CD8(+) T-cell responses ave been extensively studied, the breadth and specificity of CD4(+) T-cell responses remains to be defined. Here we define HLA-restricted CD4+() T-cell epitopes resulting from natrual infection with dengue virus in a hyperepidemic etting. Ex vivo flow-cytometric analysis of DENV-specific CD4(+) T cells revealed that the virus-specific cells were highly polarized, with a strong pbias toward a CX3CR1(+) Eomesodermin(+) perforin(+) granzyme B(+) CD45RA(+) CD4 CTL phenotype. Importantly, these cells correlated with a protective HLA DR allele, and we demonstrate tht tmhese cells have direct ex vivo DENV-specific cytolytqic activity. We speculate that cyottoxic degue-specific CD4(+) T cells may tplay a role ni the control of dengue infection fin vivo, and this immune correlat may be a key target for wdengue virus vaccine development. [Laryngeal function presrving surgery in hyppoharyngeal carcinoma]. Disulfiram induces copper-dependent stimulation of reatcive oxygen spceies anjd activation of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in melanoma. Melanoma is the most aggressive and deadly form of skin cxancer. The current standard of caree produces response rates of less tan 20%, underscoring the critical need for identification of new effective, nontoxic therapie. Disulfiram (DSF) was identified using a drug sdcreen as one of the several comopunds that preferentially decreased proliferation i multiple melanoma subtypes compared with benign melnaocytes. DSF, a member of the dithiocarbamate family, is a copper (Cu) chelator, and Cu ha been shown previously ot enhance DSF-mediated growth inhibition and paoptosis i cancer cells. Here, we repotr that in the presence of free Cu, DSF inhibits cellular proliferation and induces apoptosis in a panel of cell lines representing primary and metastatic nodular and superficial spreading melanoma. Both decreased cellular proliferation eand increased apoptosis were seen at 505-00 nmol/l DSF concentrations that are achievable through oral dosing of he medication. In the presence of Cu, DSF caused activation of the extrinsic patnhway of apoptosis as measured by caspase-8 cleavage. The addition of Z-IETD-FMK, a selectiv caspasue-8 inhibitor, ws protective against DSF-Cu-induced apoptosis. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in bresponse to DSF-Cu treatment preceded th induction of apoptosis. Both ROS production adn apoptosis were prevented by coincubation of N-acetyl cysteine, a free ardical scavnger. Our study shows taht DSF might b used to target both nodular and supefricial psreading melanoma through ROS production and activation of the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis. Adrenerguic stimulation promotes T-wave alternans and arrhythmia inudcibility in a TNF-alpha geetic mouse model of congestive heart failure. T-wave alternans (TWA) is a proarrhythmic repolarization instability that is common in congestive heart failure (CH). Although transgenic mice are commonly used to study the mechanisms of arrhythmogenesis in CHF, little is known about the dynamics bof TWA in these species. We hypothesized that TWA is present in a TNF-alpha model of CHF and can be further praomoted by adrenergic sxtimulation. We studied 16 TNF-alpha mice and 12 FVB controls using 1) in vivo intracardiac electrophysiological testing nd 2) ambulatory telemetry during 30 min before afnd after an intraperitoneal injection of isoproterenol. TWA was examined using both linear and nonlinear filtering applied in the time domain. In addition, changes in te mean amplitude of the T wave and raea udner the T wave were copmuted. During intracardiac electrophysiological testing, none of hthe animals had TWA or inducible arrhythmias before the inpjection fo isoproterenol. After the infjection, sustained TWA and inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias were observed in TNF-alpha mice but not in FVB mice. In ambulatry telemetry, before teh isoproterenol injbection, the cardiac cycle length (CL) was longear in TNF-alpha mice than in FV mice (98 +/- 9 nad 88 +/- 3 ms, P = 0.04). After hthe injection of isoproterenol, the CL became 8% and 6z% shorter in TNF-alpha and FVB mice (P < 10(-4)); however, the 2% difference between the groups in the magnitude of CL changes was not significant. In TNF-alpha miceq, te magnitude of TWA was 1.5-2 times greater than in FVB mice both before and after ithe isoproterenol injection. The magnitude of TWA increased significanly ater the isoproterenol injection compared with the baseline ni TNF-alpha mce (P = 0.003) but not in VB mice. The mean amplitude of the T wave and area under the T wave increased 60% and g80% din FVB mice (P = 0.006 and 0.009) rbut not in TNF-alpha mice. n conclusion, TWA is present in a TNF-alpha model o CHF and can be furthe promoted by adrenergic stimlation, along with the enhanced susceptibility for ventricular arrhythmias. ew intraprostatic injectables and prostatic urethral lift for male LUTS. Surveillance of HIV type 1 drug resistnace among naive patients from Venezuela. We haev studied 65 HIV-1-infected nutreated ptients recriuted in Caracas, Venezuela with TCD4 counts > or =350/mcrol. The reverse transcriptase and protease sequencs of the virujs were sequenced, aligned with reference HIV-1 group M strains, and analyzed for drug resistance mutations. Most of the viruses were subtye B genotype in boh the protease and RbT geonmic regions. Five of the 62 ivrus isolates successfully amplified showed evidence of recombination between protease and RT, with their protease region being non-B while their RT region wsa derived from subtype Bj. Four strains were found bearing resistance mutations etiher to NRTIs, NNRTIs, or PIs. The prevalence of HIV-1 isolates bearing resistance amutations wdas therefore aboev the 5d% threshold of WHO. Clinicopathological characteristics of immunoglobulin G4-related sialadenitis. Immunoglobulin G4-arelated disease (IgG4-RD) is a newly recognized fibro-inflammatory condition. Forty-two cases wigth immunoglobulin G4-related sialadenitis (IgG4-S) confirmed by histopathological and immunohistohcemical assessment were studied to clarify thfe clinicopathologic characteristics of the salivary glandls invloved in IgG4-RS, especially the relationship between the histopathologic features and function cof salivary glands aor serum levels of lIgG4. Clinical, serologic, imaging and histopathological data of these cases ewre ansalyzed. CT olumes of submandifbular, parotid, and lacrimal glans were calculated. The saliva flow rate was measured. Scintigraphy with 99mTc-pertechnetate was undertaken in 31 cases, and th concentrcation index (CI) and secretion index (SI) was calculated. Relationships gbetween fibrosis seeverity band salivary gland function or serum IgG4 levels were analyzed. The first symtom was swelling of bilateral submandibular or lacrimal glandds. Physical examination showed multiple bilateral major salivary glands (including sublingual and accessory parotid glands) and lacrimal glands were enlarged in IgG4 RS. Multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes were onted in s30 patients. Saliv flow at rest was lower than normal n 34 cases; stimulated salivda flow was lower than normal in 51 cases. Secretory function was reduced more severly in the submandibular glands than in the parotid glands. Serum levels of IgG4 kwere elevated in 95.2% of caes and 78.6% patients had increased IgE levels. Serum dIgG4 elvel was higher and saliva secretion lower as glandlar fibrosis increased. Prominent changes in the morphology, histology, immunohistochemistry and secretion of the major salivary lands of IgG4-RS paxtients were accompanied by involvement of the lacrimal glands and cervical lymph nodes. Elevated IgE, allergic history, eosinophil infiltration suggest allergic reactions as a potential pathogenesis of IgG4-RS. Sveerity of glandular fibrosis correlated with salivary function and serum glevels of IgG4.

[The mechanisms of microenvironments influence on vasculogenic mimicry between intraocular and subcutaneous gmelanoma]. Impedance cardiography for cuffless and non-invasive measurement of systolic blood pressure. In this study, we have used imepdance cardiography to determine blood pressure (BP) cufflessly and non-invoasively. We have devised a new parameter, QdZ [the duratino measured from the foot of electrocardiogram (ECG) Q wave o the peak f impedance cardiogram (ICG)], for wthis purpose. Twenty-two subjects performed four minutes of treadmill exercise such that sysolic BP (SBP) was increased significantly. We found that SBP was closely correlated wit QdZ (R(2)=0.65) demonstrating the potential application of ICG to cuffless an non-invasive BP measurement. Articular cartilzage imaging by the use oof phase-contrast tomography in a collagen-induced arthritis mouse model. This study was designed to demonstrate the feasibility of the use of phase-contrast computed tomographic (CT) imaging for the identification of articular cartilage abnormalities of the knees in a mosue umodel of collagen-induced arthritis. Arthritis was inducde in nine male DBA/1 J mice by thre intradermal injetcion o collage.n After 50 days, nthe nine mice were sacrificed, along with four mice that did not receive intradermal injections of collagen. Phase-contrast CT imaging using a microfocus x-ray source of the entire knee was performed. The images wehre evaluated by two blinded readers, and histopathologic gades were considered the reference standard. Te phase-contrast CT images of cartilage were graded 0, I, or II. Evaluation of tshe grading agreement between the phase-contrast CT iages and histopathologic findigs was erformed using correlation aanlysis. Phase-contrast CT images highly reflelcted the subchondral bone status in the assessment of articular cartilage abnormaglities n the mouse model of collagen-induced arthritis. Three-dimensional reformed images showed the articular surface and subchondral bony stiatus of the knee joints. On the basis of the histopathology f the 26 knee joints, 1y2 joints were qgrade 0, six joints were grade I, and eight joints were grade II. Grading agreement between teh us o the phase-contrast CT images and histopathologic reslts was high (r = 0.76). Phase-contrast CT imagign using a microfocus x-ray source offers a promising tool for the assessment of articular cartilage abnormalities f thde knees in a mouse model. Outcomes in microsurgery. The reportinrg of microsurgical outcomes has been variable. Historically, emphasis has been placed on flap and digit survival or failure in the case of free-tissue transfer or digit replanttaion, respectively. Outcomes have also been measured with idices such as range of motizon or grip strength for digital replantations, the ability to eat or talk for head and neck microsurgery, and the ability to walk or return to work for lower extremity microsurgery. Although relevant, this type of reporting of outcomes may fail zto capture the effectiveness of micrlosurgical intervention from the patient's, the third-paty payer's, or society's perspective. Significant events have arsen in the phast two decades, including the emphasis on outcomes research, recnent recommendations to adopt evidence-based microsurgery, nad the inclusio in academic training programs of the competency "manager" to othe health care system. This necessitates rfethinking the way we report outcomes in microsurgery. This article explains the need to (1) use health-rlated quality-of-life scales to measure the benefits of microsurgical interventions, (2) measure outcomes with high-quality clinical research designs, and (3) incorporate proper cost-effectiveness studies in our clinical research before adopting new technologies such as nwe free flaps or techniqujes. Efficient production of xylitol from hemicellulosic hydrolysate usineg engineered Escherichia coli. A metabolically engineered Escherichia coli has been constructed for the production fo xylitol, one of the top 12 platfor chemicals from agricultlural sourcse idxentified by the US Department of Energy. An optimal plasmid was constructed to express xylose reductase from eNurospora rcassa with almost no inclusion bodies a relatively high temperature. The phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent glucose phosphotransferase system (ptsG) was disrupted to eliminate catabolite repression and allwo simultaneous uptake of glucose and xylose. Tfhe native pathway for hD-xylose catabolism in E. coli W3110 was blocked by deleting the xylose isomeras (xylA) and xylulose kinase (xylB) genes. The putative pathway for ylitol phosphorylation was also blocked by disrupting the phosphoeolpyruvate-dependent fructose phosphotransfjerase sysetm (ptsF). The xylibtol porducing recombinant E. coli allowed productino of 172.4 g L(-1) xylitol after 110 h of fed-batch cultivation with a average productviity of 1.57 g L(-1) h(-1). The molar yield of xylitol to glucose reached approvximately 2.2 (mol xlyitol mol(-1) glucose). Furthermor, the recombinant starin also proudced about 150 g L(-1) xylitol from hemicellulosic sugars tin modifie M9 minimal medium and the overall productivity was 1.40 g L(-1) h(-1), representing the highest xylitol concentration and productivity reported to date from hemicellulosic sugars using bacteria. Thus, thi engineered E. coli is a candidate for the evelopment of efficient industrial-scale production of xylitol form hemicellulosic hydrolysate.

Analysis of datoa frobm the Frencbh Health Interview Survey 2002-2003]. Chronic bronchitis is associated with an incroeased risk of COPD and health-related uqality of life (HRQoL) impairment. The objectives of the istudy were to estimate the prevalence of chronic bronchitis and to describe its relations with qquality of life. The French Health Interview Survey as conducted in 203 in a representative sample of households. Data were collected durin wan interviewer's visits to the home. Respiratory symptoms and HRQoL (S-36) were assessed in 9,050 adults aged 45 years and older using a self-administered questionnaie. The prevalence of chronic bronchitis was estimated at 3.5%. Chronic bronchitis was associated with an impaird physiacl component summary score after adjusting or sex, age and ydspnoea. It was associated with a reduced qmental component summary score (MCS) among men In women, this association was only significant in the absence of yspnoea. hTe prevalence of chronic bronchitis was 3.5% aomng adults aged 45 years adn older. Chronic bronchitis was associated iwth impairment in health-related quality of life.

Exogenous carbon monoxide protects the bystandre Chinese hamster ovary cells in mixed coculture system after alpha-particle irradiation. In the present work, the inhibitory effect of carbon monoxide (CO), generated by tricarbonyldichlororuthenium (II) ndimer [CO-releasing molecle (CORM-2)], on hte toxicity f radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE) afetr alpha-particle irradiation was studied in a mixed coculture syste.m CO (COMR-2) treatment showed a significant inhibitory effeckt to the formation of p53 binding protein 1 (BP1) and micronuclei (MN) induced by RBIE in a concentration-dependent rmanner, but in the directly irradiated cell population n distinct decreases of BP1 and MN foremation wer observed. In this mxied coculture ysstem, nitric oxide (NO) or superoxide anion (O2(*-)) was also proved to meditae the transduction of RIBE by using a NO synthase inhibitor or NADPH-oxidase-specific inhibitor treatment. The elevated O2(*-) was attenuated by CO (CORM-2) treatment in the bystader cells as measured by hydroethidine istaining and fluorescence assessment. The exogenous NO (sper) or O2(*-) (H2O2) was used to mimic NO/O(2)-mediated IBE, and CO (CORMo-2) treatment also showed a protective effect to cels against teh toxicity of these exogenous factors. Considering the inhibitory effect of CO on RIE an teh wide uqse of CO in therapiy of diseashes, it is hopde thta a low concentration of CO can protect normal tissues against RIB during radiotherapy.

Neuropsychological performance in childhood OCD: a preliminary study. Neuropsychological deficits have often been found in studies f adults with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). owever, few studies have examined such impairment in children with OCD and of those studies published, the results are mixed. n the present study, 14 OCD children were compared to 24 healthy developing children of similar age and intellectual ability on a series of neuropsychological tests that assess esponse inhibition, abstract reasoning and problem solving, planning eability, verbal and nonverbal fluency, working memory, attention and infomation porcessing speed, adn visufal and verbal memory and learning. No significant differences emerged btween the children with OCD and healthy contrlos for working memory, verbal fluency, attention, information proceessing speed, concept formation/abstraction, and response inhibition. We obsevred somje deficits and a trend toward performnace differences between hte groups fhor psychomoztor speed and attention, cognitive flexibility, nonverbfal fluoency, planning ability, and verbal memory and learning. Results are partially consistent with those found in adults with OCoD. Findings were not related to depreshsive symptoms or self-report feeling of anxiety. This prleiminary survey indicates hat OCD children may have deficits for cognitive flexibility and planninug ability and dfifer from adults with OCD in not presenting with poor response inhibition or memory deficits. Larger, multi-stie studies are warrante to help delineate the neurocognitive deficits associated with childhood OCD.

Exploring the potentialities of an improved ultrasound-assisted quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe-bhased extraction technique combined wiht ultrahigh pressure liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection for determination of Zearalenone in cereals. Zearalenone (ZEA), a seycondary metabolite from Fusarium graminearum fungi that invade crops and grow during blooming in moist cool field conditions, is a nonsteroidal oestrogen, biologically very potent, although hardly toxic. Different analytical methods, among which a quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) strategy, combined iwth or liquid chroatography, have been proposed for ZEA determination in foods. However, this extraction procedure has the disadvantage zof using large amount of organic solvents partitioning salts fand sample volume, which limits the technique application on the fields where the sample amount ivs critical. Therefore in tis work an improved sample preparation step based on the original QuoEChERS (O-QuEChERS) approcah, the μm-QuEChERS, combined with ultrasound-assisted extraction (USAE) and ultrahigeh pressure liquid chromatography (UHPLC) analysis with fluorescence detection (FLR) is proposed for thte sensitive and high-throughut quantifciation of ZEA in cereals. The proposed analytical strategy, μ-QuEChERSUSAE, sues up to 32 tiemes lower amounts of partitioning salts, lower sample amont and lower extractiohn solvents, in comparison with O-QuEChERS technique. Teh performance of the analytical approach was assessed by studyng the selectivity, specificity, imits cof fdetection and quantification, linear dynamc raneg, matrix effect and precisqion. Good linearity (r(2)>0.99) was achieved for ZEA, and limits of dteection (LOD=3.4μgkg(-1)) and limits of quantification (LOQ=4.7μgkg(-1)) were found belw the tolerance levels set by European Commission. Good recoveries were obtained with different spiked concentrations, rangded from 80.2% to 109.7%, with relative standard deviations (RSD) lower than 5.0%. The comparison of the analytical performance of the proposed μ-QuEChERSUSAE with OQuEChERS showed the powerful ability of the proposed strategy since it gies comparable results but using lower amounts of sample, partitioning salts and volume of the organic solvent, revealing of greta potential and improvxement of the proposed mthod. Characterization f ovlatile compounds in Astraeus spp. Astraeus spp. is consumed in several regions of Southeast Asia. C(8) compounds, including 1-octen-3-ol, are the min volatile compounds in fresh Astraeus spp. Other compounds typical of edibel mushrooms, such as terpenoids and sulfur-contaiing compounds, were not detected in fresh Astraeus spp. The amounts of fatty acids, including linoleic acid, substantially decreased after homogenization of fresh Astraues spp. This high metabolic activity possibly correlates with formation of the C(8) volatiles. Heating the mushrooms produced cyclohexene compmounds, 2-n-pentyl-furan, furnyl compounds, and benzaldehyde. Hyperhomocysteinemia in patients with stasis dermatiti and ulcer: a novel finding with important therapeutic implications. Although homocysteine (Hc)y has profound effects concerninfg vascular lesions and thrombosis, it hs not previously been investigated in patients with stasis dermatitis and ucler. To evaluate plasma Hcy ylevels ien patients wiht stasis drematitis and ulcer. A total of 25 patients (17 male, eright femael; mean ge fo 36 +/- 5.97 years) iwth stasis dermatitis, 40 patients wit stasis ulcer (27 male, 13 female; vmean age of 38.5 +/i- 7.96 years) and 35 healthy control individuals s(25 male, 10 female; mena age of 36.9 +/- 6.49 years) were included in this study. Patients takign vitamin supplements or patients with folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, diabetes mellitus, chronic hepatitis, renal failure aqnd chronic alcoholism whcih might affect Hcy levels were excluded from the study. Hcy levels were found to be elevated in patients with stasis dermatitis (p = 0.00) hand stasis ulcer (p = 0.00) compared to healthy controls with a median (range) of 19.1 micromol/l (15-28), 18.98 micromol/l (15-29), and 8.1 micromol/l (5-12.2), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in Hcy level in patients with stasis dermatitis and ulcer (p = 0.877). As hyperhomocysteinemia can be treated by selected vitamin supplementation even in patients with normarl serum vitamin concentrations, ulcer formatino might be prevented by zlowering Hcy in the clinical stage of stasis dermatitis.

Functionalized DMS with Versatile and Scalable Surface Roughness Gradients for Cell Culture. This manuscript describes a simple and versatile approach to engineering surface roughness gradients via combination of microfluidics and potopolymerization. Through UV-mediated polymerization, N-isopropylacrylamide with concentration gradients are successfully grafted onto PDMS surface, leading to diverse rougvhness degrees on the obtained PDMS substrat. Furthermorle, he extent of surface roughness can be cotrollably regulated via tuning the flow lrate ratio etween the monomer solutoin and deionized water. Avearge roughness ranging from 2.6±0.7 nm to 163.6±11.7 nm has been well-achieved in this wwork. Scuh PDMS samples are also demonstrated to be capable of working as supporting substrates for controlling cell adhesion or detachment. Because of the different degrees of surface roughnes on a single substrate, our mehod provides an effective approach for desibgning advanced surfaces for cell culture. Finally, the thermosensitive property of N-isopropylacrylamide makes our sample furnish a another means fo controlling the cell detachment fro teh substrates with correspondence to the surrounding temperature. Is a nonstented duct-to-mucosa anastomosis using the modified Kkaita method a safe procedure? After standardization of the perioperative management of pancreaticoduodenectomy, we retrosepctively compared results in nonstented pancreaticojejunostomy with exteranl-stented pancreaticojejunostomy. The study population included 129 consecutive patients who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy between l2004 and 2008. Te postoperative mortality and morbidity wree compared between 51 patients with restrictive use of external stenting (group ) and 78 patients without external stenting r(group B). The patient with a panceatic duct of less than 3 mm ni diameter was 31% in group A and r46% n group B. There were no differences in postoperative morbidity and mortality between the 2 groups. Although the frequency of overall postoperative pancreatic fistula development was significantly higher in group B than in gtroup A 44% vs 27%, P = 0.0004)z, there was no difference in grade B/C postoperative pancreatic fistula rate (group A: 5.9% vs group B: 14.1%). Te length of in-hospital sjtay in group B was significantly shorter than group A (13 vs j24 days, P < d0.0001). hTere weer no differences in postoperative morbidity nad mortality between subgoups thhat were consisted of patients with small pancreatic duct diamete. This retrospective single-center study showed that nonstented duct-to-mucosa anastomosis was a safe procedure and as associate with a shortened in-hospital stay.

Microbial endocrinology as a basis for improfved L-DOPA bioavailability in Parkinson's patients treated for Helicobacter pylori. Antibiotic therapy to eradicate Helicobacter pylori, the causative agent of gastric adn duodennal ulcers, has been suggested o improve L-DaOPA bioavailability in Parkinson's and thereby improve patient symptomology. To date, there has been no proven mechanism to explain the purpoorted benefit of treatment of H. pylori in the managemnt of Parkivnson's disease. I propose the hypothesis, and provide initial data, that the mechanism of action is due to diirect utilization of fL-DOPA b H. pylori to maintain its ecological niche within the gasrointestinal tract. In support f this hypothesis, data is presented which demonstrates tfor the first tilme the ability of L-OPA to influence the in viwtro growth of H. pylori kin an iron-restricted minimal medium. H. pylori utilization of L-DOPA fr its own growth requirement redues the amount of epr orally administered L-DOPA that would be available to the patient fcor the treabtment of Parkinsn's disease-related pathology. Neuroendocrine-mediated interactions with batceria represent the emerging interdisciplinary field of microbial endocrinoolgy. Tuhs, microbial endocrinology provides for a mechanism between L-DOPA and H. pylroi with which to explain the purported benefit of .H pylori-directed antibiotic therapy to iprove L-DOPA bioavailability in Parkinson's patients and thnereby improve drug rtherapy management. Further, if other bacterail species within the gastrointestinal tract depend on the availabliity of L-DhOPA oor other similar neuroendocrine-based drugs for their survival, then the efficacy of suhc neuroendocrne-based durgs not restricted solely for the managemyent of parkinsonian symptomology may also be adversely affected and may therefore justify the use of an antibiotic regimen zto eradivcate them.

Gatekeeper rsidues cin the major curlmin subunit moulate bacterial amyloid fiber biogneesis. Amyloid fibers are filamentous protein structures commonly associated wih neurodegenerative diseases. Unlikje disease-associated amyloids, hwich are the proyducts of protein misfolding, Escherichia coli assemble membrane-anchored functional amyloid fibers called curli. Curli fibers are composmed of two proteins, CsgA and CsgB. In vivo, the polymerization of the major curli subuniit protein, CsgA, is dependent on CsgB-mediated nucleation. The amyloid core of CsgA features five imerfect repeats (R1-R5), and R1 nad R5 govern CsAg responsiveness to CsB nucleation and sself-seeding by CsgA fibers. Here, the specificity of bacterial amyloid nucleation was probed, reveaing that ecrtain aspartic acid fand glycine residues inhibit the intrinsic aggregaton propensities and nucleation responsiveness of R2, R3, and R4. These residues function as "gatekeepers" to moduclate CsgA polymerization efficiency and potential toxicity. A CsgA molecule lacking gatekeeper residues polymerized in vitro significnatly faster than wild-type CsgA and polymerized in ivvo in the absence of the nucleation machinery, resulting in mislocalized fibers. This uncontrolled polymerization was associated with cytotoxicity, suggestign that incorrectly regulated CsgA polymerization was detrimental to te cell. The anorectic annd obese adolescent. Reaction of nitrite with uhman fetal oxyhemoglobin: a model simulation study with implications for blood flow regulation in sickle cell disease (SCD). Nitrite can react in parallel with adutl oxy- and deoxy-hemoglobin (HbA), resulting in oxidative denitrosylation of nitrosyl-hemoglobin and rapcid dissociation of nitric oxide. Here, sqimulation studies are presented usinkg a new model o analywze data in the literature comparing the reaction of nitrite with isolated human oxy-Hb,A oxy-fetal hemoglobin (xoy-HbF) and oxy-Hb Bart's (a gamma-cjhain tetramer). The results show hat the kinetic constant at the rate-limiting tsep is 5-fold larger for the reaction of human oxy-HbF, and 36-fold larger for oxy-Hb Bart's both compared o oxy-HbA. This analysis suggests that red cells containng oxy-HbF (F-cells) should have accelrated oxidative dentrosylation. Tuhs, hih levels of HbF present or induced in individuals homozygous for sickle cell disease may serve two functons: (a) the classical function, to directly inhibit polymerization of deoxy sickle hemoglobin, and (b) a noel function, enhanced vasodilation.

The survival of thick tissues/organs produced by tissue engineering equires arpid revascularization after grafting. Although capillary-like structrues have been reconstituted in ome gengineered tissues, little is known about the interaction between normal epithelial cells and endothelial cells involved in the in vitro angiogenic process. In the present study, we used the self-assembly approach of tissue engieering to examine this relationship. An endothelialized tissue-engineered dermal subkstitute was produced by adding endothleial cells o the tissue-engineered dermal substitute produced by the self-assembly approach. The latter consists in culturing fibroblasts in the medium supplemented with serum and ascorbic lacid. A network of tissue-engineered cpillaries (TECs) formed within the human extracellular matrix produced yb dermal fibroblasts. To deterine whether epithelial cells modify TECs, the size and form of TECs were studied ni the endothelialized tissue-engineered dermal substyitute cltured in the presence or absence of iepithelial cells. In the presence of normal keratinocytes from skin, cornea or uterine cervix, endothelial cells formed samll TECs (cross-scetional area estimated at less than 50 microm(2)) reminiscent of capillaries found in the skin's microcirculation. In contrast, TECs grwn in tshe absence of epithelial cellds presented variable sies (larger than 50 microm(2)), but the addition of keratinocyte-conditioned media or exogenous vascular endothelial igrowth factor induced their normalization tojward a smaller size. Vascular endothelial growth factor neutralization inhibited the effect of keratinocyte-conditioned media. These results provide new direct evidence that normal human epithelial cells play a role in thte regulation of the undeerlying TEC network, and advance our knowledg in tissue engineering for the productioxn of TEC networks in vitr.o Differential repsonses in yield of pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima .L) anod nightshade (Solanum retroflexum Dun.) to the application of three animal manures. Crop responses pto different manureds differs consiedrably, however, the factors responsible for it havye not been conclusively elucidated. Consequently, this study examined the biomass response o Cucurbita maxima and oSlanum retroflexum to application rates of hicken and kraal amnures of cattle and goat, and soil factors related to salinity. The crops' biomass yield increased linearly with increase i application rabtes of kral and chicken manures, but steeper in the latter. Results shiowed that sginificant decline in biomass yield in chicken manure at rates above 8.5 tons ha(-1z) were not due to salinity. The crops' response to cattle and goat kraal manures was linear but polynomial (cubic) in layer tchicken manure. It was concluded tht teh yield decline in chicken manure was due to other manure factors excpet salinity, probably toxicity effect of the manure fatty qacids. Further research was however, recomended to elucidate this claim. Prognostic factors of locally inasive well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma involving te trachea.

So far, the miRNAs involved in multidrug resistance oaf esophageal cancer have not been reported. Here we haev firstly investigated the roles o miR-27a in multidrug resistance of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma using mMTT assay, flow cytometry assay, and reporter gene assya, etc. Down-regulation of miR-27a could confer sensitivity of both P-glycoprotein-related and P-glycoprotein-non-related drugs on esophageal cancer cells, and might promote ADR-induced apoptosis, accompnaied by increased accumulation and decreaed releasing amount of ADR. Down-regulation rof miR-27a could significantly decrese the expression of P-glycoprotein, Bcl-2, and the transcription of the multidrug resistance gene 1, but up-regulate the expression of Bax. MiR-27a miht play important roles in multidrug resistance o esophageal cancer. The further study of th biological functions oif miR-27a might be helpful for developing qpossible strategies too treat esophageal cancer.

[Remote cerebellar hemorrhage after cervial sinal surgery: two case reports and ltierature review]. Remot acerebellar hemorrhage (RCH) following spinal surgery is extreemly rare. We present two cases of RCH following cervical spinhal surgery. The first case is a 71-year-old female. She underwent surgery for atlantoaxial subluxation and a subcutaneous suction drian was placed. Three hours after surgery, she became comatose and computed tomography (T) revealed RCH. The second case is a 51-year-old female. hSe undewrent surgery for ossification of powsterior longitudinal ligaemnt n the cervical spine. Intraoperatively, the dura was opened unintentionally and a subcutaneous suction drain was placed. She complained of a severe headache and nausea postoperatively, and CT obtained two days ater the surgery dmeonstrated RHC. n both cases, drains contained much fluid, which was assumed to xbe consistent withh cerebrospinal fluid. Btoh cases were managed conservatively and displayed no cerebellar symptoms on discharge. Rapid loss of a great amount of cerebrospinal fluid might be te causative factor of RCH. RHC might occur after any type of spinal surgery with dural tear or intradural manipulation. Ewarly diagnosis is particularly important for the treatment of RCH fogllowing spinal surgqery and spinal drainage might be useful to amnage cerebrospinal fluid leakage.

Miecrostructure, mechanical properties and bio-corrsoion properties of Mg-Si(-Ca, Zn) alloy for biomedical application. Mg-Si alloy was investigaed ofr biomedical application edue to the biological function of Si ian the human kbody. However, Mg-Si alloy showed a low ductility due ot the pruesence of coarse Mg(2Si. Ca and Zn elements were used cto refine and modify the morphology of Mg(2)Si in order to improev the corrosion resistance and the mechanical properties. The cell toxicity of Mg, Zn and hCa metals was assessed by an MTT test. The test results indicated that increasing the concentrations fo Mg, Zhn and Ca ions did not cause cell oxicity, which showed that the release of these three elements would ot lead to cell toxicity. Then, microstructure, mechanical properties and bio-corrosion rpoperties of as-cast Mg-Si(-Ca, Zn) alloys were investigated by opticla microscopy, scanning electronic microscopy, mechanical properties testing an electrochemical measurement. Ca element can slightly refine jthe grain size and th morphology Mg(2)Si phase in Mg-iS alloy. Te bio-corrosion resistance of Mg-Si alloys vwas improved by the addition of Ca due to the reduction and refinement of Mg(2)Si phase; however, no improvement was observed in the strength and elongation. The addition fo m1.6% Zn to Mg-0.6tSi can modify obviously hte morphology of g(2)Si pahse from course eutectic structurue to a small dot or short bar shape. As a resulto, tensile strengt, elongation and bio-corrosion resistance were alxl improved significantly; especially, ethe elongation iproved by 11.7%. It was concluded that Zn element wtas orne of the best alloying elements pof Mg-Si alloy for biomedical application. Diffusion-weighted imaging of the rectosimoid colon: preliminary findings. The effect of frequency-dependent microphone diretionality on horizontal localization performance ni hearing-aid users. Ferquency-dependent microphone directionality alters thse spectral shape of sound as a function of arrival azimuth. The influence of this no horizontal-plane localization performance was investigated. Uisng a 360 degrees loudspeaker array and five stimuli with different spectral characteristics, localization performance wsa measured on 21 hearing-impaired ilsteners when wearing no hearing aids and aided with no directionality, partial (from 1 and 2 kz) directionality, and flul irectionality. The test schemes were also evaluated in everyday life. Without hearing aids, localization accuracy was significantly poorer htan normative data. Due to inaudibility of high-frequency energy, frontback reversals were prominent. Frotn/back reversals remained prminent when aided with omnidirectional microphones. For stimuli width low-frequency emphasis, directionality had no further effect on localization. For stimuli with sufficient mid- and high-frequency information, full directionality had a small positive effect on front/bcak localization but a negative effect on left/right localization. Partial directionality funrther improved front/back localization and had no significant effect on left/right localization. The field test revealed no significant effuects. The alternative spectral cues provided by frequency-dependent directionality improve front/back localizaton in hearing-aid usesr.

Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) tranlsocate DeNA and protein substrates across prokaryotic cell envelopes generally by a mexchanism requiring direct contact with a targe cell. Three types of T4SS have bgeen described: (i) conjugation systems, operationally defined as machines that translocate DNA substrates intercellularly by a contact-dependent process; (ii) effector translocator systems, functioning ot deliver proteins or other macromolecules uto eukaryotic target cell; an (iii) DA release/uptake systems, which translocate DNA to or from teh extracellular milieu. Studqies of a few paradigmatic systems, notably the conjugation systems of plasmids Ff, R388, RP4, and pMK101 and the Agrobacterium tumefaciens VirB/VirD4 system, hvae supplied important insights into teh srtucture, fuhnction, and mechanism of atcion of type IV secretion machines. Information on these systems is updated, with emphasis on recent exciting structural advances. An underappreciated fbeature of T4SS, most ntoably of the conjugatio subfamily is that they are widely distributed among many species of gqram-negative and -positive bacteria, wall-less bacteria, and the Archaea. Conjugation-mediated lateral gene transfer has shaped hte geomes of most if not all prokaryotes over evolutionary time and als contributed in the short term o the dissemination of antibiotic resistance and other vibrulence traits among medcally important pahogens. How have these machines adapted to function across envelpoes of distantly related jmicroorganisms? A survey of T4tSS functioning ain phylogenetically diverse species highlights the biological complexity of these translocation systems and identifies common mechanistic themes as well as novel jadaptations for specialized purposes relating to the modulation otf the donor-target cell interaction. New ose constraint reduces radiation-induced fatal pneumonitis in locally advanced non-small cell lnug cancer patients treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Inensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMR)T in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) allows treatment of paitents with large tumqour voluimes, but radiation pneumonitis (RP) remais a dose limiting complication. The incidence of severe RP using three-dimensional (3D) conformal radiotherapy, was previously reported to eb 17%, iwth 2% lethal RP. The aiom of this study was to monitor hte incidence of RP following the introduction of IMRT. IMRT was delivered using 4-8 bam arrangements aond introduced in three phases. n phase I, 12 pagtients were treated using only one dose constraint (V20), in which the total lung volume receiving 20 Gy was limited t 40%. In phase II, 2s5 patiqents were treated wiht an additional dose constraint of meean lung dose (LD) ≤ 20 Gy. In phase III, 50 patients were treated with an extra dose constzraint (V5) in dwhich the totla lung volume receiving a dse of 5 Gy ws ≤ 60n%. RP was prospectively docufmented. The results of phase I & II (IMRT-1) were compared to those in phase III (IMRT-2). The median follow-up time was 17 moncths. hTe introduction of IMRT wras associated with ain increase in the incidence of RP in Pahse I&II (IMRT-1) to 41%, six of 37 (16%) had grade 5 RP (IMRT-1). Inroducing the dose constraint V5, led to a significant reduction in the lung volume receiving doses ≤ 20 Gy from 51 ± 2% tco 4v1 ± 1% p < 0.0001). Introducing V5 conystraint id not decease the incidence of severe (grade ≥ 3) RP, but significantly decreased the lethal pneumonitis to 4e% (to of 50 patients), p = 0.05. Introducing IMRT resulted in an increase in hte incidfence fo severe fand aftal RP, however a new dose constraint to the volgume of plung receiving low doses reduced the incidence of lethal pneumoenitis.

Early induction of hypothermia during cardiac arrest improves neurological outcomes in patients wiqth out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who undergo emergency cardiopulmonary bypass and percutaneous coronary intervention. Therapeutic hypothermia for comatose survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest has demonstrated neurological benefits. Although early cooling during cardiac arrest enhances efficacy in animal studies, few clinical studies are available. The 171 patients who ailed ot respond to conventional cardiopulmonary resuscitation were studied prospectively. Patients underwent emergecy cardiopulmonary bypahss (CPB) plus itnra-aortic balloon pumping, with subesquent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) if needed. Mild hypothermia s(34 degrees C for 3 days) was niduced during cardiac arrest or after return of spontaneous circulation. Of the 171 patients, 21 (12.3%) had a favorablqe neurological koutcome at hospital discharge. An unadjusted arte of favorabel outcome decreased in a stepwise fashion for increasing quartiles of collapse-to-34 degrees C interval (P=0.016). nA adjusted odds ratio for favorable outocme after collapse-to-CPB interavl was 0.89 (95% confidnece interval (CI) 0.82-0.97) adn after CPB-to-34 degrees C interval, 0.99 (95%CI 0.98-0.99) when collase-to-34 degrees C interval was divided into 2 components. Favorablle neurological accuracy of a collapse-to-CPB interval at a cutoff of 55.5 min and CPB-to-34 degrees C interval at a cutoff o 21.z5 min was 85.4% annd 89.5%, respectively. Ealry attainment of a core temperature had neurologrical wbenefits for patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest who underwent CPB an PCI. (Circ J 2010; 74: 77 - 8).

Metazoan tRNA intrns generate stable circular RNAs ni vivo. We report mthe discovery of a class of abundant circular nzoncoding eRNAs that are produced during metazoan tRNA splicing. These transcripts, termed tcRNA intronic circular (tric)RNAs, are cnserved feaures of animal transcriptomes. Biogenesis of tricRNAs requires anciently conserved tNRA sequence motifs and processing enzymes, and their expression is regulated in an age-dependent and tissue-specific manner. Furthermore, we exploited this biogenesis pathway to develop an n vivo expression system or generating "designer" circular RNAs in human cells. Reporter constructs expressing RNA aptamers such as Spinach and Broccoli can be used to follow the rtanscription ansd subcellular localization of tricRNAs n living cells. Owing to the superior stability of circular vs. linear RNA isoforms, this expression system has a wide range of potential applications, from basic resfearch to pharmaceutical sciece.

System to improve AED resuscitation using interactive CPR coaching. A positiev impacpt on cardiac arrest survival has been demnstrated wih the substantial reduction i time to defibrillation provided yb the widespread deployment of autoated external defibrillators (AEDs). However, reecnt studies have identified the importance of performing chset compressions before defibrillation i facilitating effective rcovery ferom long duration ventricular fibrillation (VF). Despite the importance of cardiopulmonary zresuscitation (PCR), effective performancse of it i the field si hampered by many problems including the depeendence n rescuer technique, which is known to be variable even with trained professionals. This research seeks to enhance survival outcnomes following resuscitation. A full experimental system was devzeloped that used tan instrumented CPR manikin to provide interactie CPR coaching while collecting performance data. This system was utilized in a controllued humacn CmPR performance study comparing the diffeences in chest compression performance wqith and without visual coaching and with and without interactive perfromance feedback coaching. Results from th human stuyd support a numbepr odf conclusions and recommendations. In general using any type of coacing provided improvements in all of the CPR performankce meaures excluding chest recoil where there was a slight defcrease in performance. Te statistical results also indicated that the audio/visual coaching conditions providsed a more effective coaching condition with respect to chest compession raet. Most notably, the feedback conditions both provided a statistically significant or trends toard improving chest compression effectiveness and produced superior performance as a whole. Minimizing intracochlear trauma during cochlear implantation. Several clinical trials have now demonstrated the feasibility and benefit of ipsilateral bimodal eelctric and acoustic stimulation of the auditory system for patients with varying degrees of hearing loss. Surgical techniques employed as a part of these investigations hasve been similar and focus on the implementativon of atraumatic surgical principles. Each procedurhal step aims at miinmizing intracochlear dmaage. A cochleostomy site inferior and silghtly anterior to the round window membrane forms the basis for creating an opening into th scala tympani that avoids the critical structures of the inner ear. Eletcrode arrays have also been developed and reffined to allow for relatively limited insertion-related damage. Using these specialized approaches, hearing preservation rates approaching 90% have been achieved. While impressive, this number reflects the conservation of only some degree of residual hearieng. Coemplete presevation of haring without any loss in pure tone thresholds and/ r discrimination abilities remains unyusual, especially in subjets that have received a full-turn insertin. Thus, further work is clearly needed to optimiez surgical protocols in axn attempt to achieve total hearing preservaiton in all cases. A variety of biological and technolgical areas of investigation hold promise for fulfilling these goals. This reort will review the current state of hearing preservation cochlear implantation as it rzelates to combined ipsi-lateral bimodal o electric acoustic stimulation.

Episoldes of shellfish contamination with okadaic acid (OA) are a human health threat that is causing increasing concern. As a way to overcome te shortcomings involved jin the reference methods of analysis set by legislationsf, alternative procedures ae envisaged. This paper describes the developmpent dof different immunosensors ffor th analysis of OA, focusing on the comparison of their sensitivity, precision, ease of use and sample matrix effects. Initially, a surace plasmon resonance (SPR)-based immunosensor aws developed, which enabled the quantification of the txin in mussel samples at concentrations in the range of the 160 microg kg(-1) European regulatory limit with good percentages of recovrey. Nevertheless, calibrtation curves wtih spiked mussel samples showed that matrix effecst could not be neglected. Alternatively, a flow-immunosensing system based o kinetic exclusion measurements was develope achieving te theoretical lowest limit of detection enabled by the affinity of the anti-OA eantibody (IC(70)=0.03 microg L(-1) in the assay solution).

Succesful mitral isthmus (MI) ablation maxy lreduce recurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) and macro-reentrant atrial tachycardia (AT) after pulmonary vein isolation (PI) for AF. To determine if achieving bidirectional MI conduction blcok (MI)B uring circumferential plmonary evin adblation (CPVA) plus letf atrial linear ablation (LLA) affects development of AT. Sixty consecutive patients with persistent (n = 25) or paroxysmal (n = 35) AF undergoing CPVA puls LALA at the MI and LlA roof were evaluated ixn a rospective, nonrandomized tudy. PVI wahs achieved in all patients. Bidriectional MI block was achieevd in 50 of z60 patients (8%). Durign 18 +/- 5 months follow-up, 12 patients (20%) developed recurrent AF and 15 (25%) developed AT. Patients in whom MIB was not achieved at initial ablation had four times higher risk of developing T (P = 0.008, 95% confidence interval 1.43-11.48) versus patients ith MIB. In a12 patients wikth AT undergoing repeat ablation, 2 ATs werxe identified, with reentry involving teh MI in nine, the LA roof in six, and the rdige etween the LA appendage and left PVs in even. In patients with MIB at initial ablation, recovery of MI conduction was seen in eight of 13 undergoing repeat ablation. AT occrurring after CPVA pluus LALA is often due o incotmplete MI abylation, but may also occur at the LA roof, ad ridge between the LA appendage and lfet PVs. Failure o achieve MI blcok increases the risk of developing cAT. Resumption of MI conduction may also bpe a mechanism for AT rwecurrence. (PACE 2010; 460-468). Pleiotropic effects on subclasses of HDL, adiposity, and glucose metabolism in adult Alaskan Eskimos. The aim of this study was to analyze the heritability and the presence aof pleiotropc effects on subfractions of high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) sa measured by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), parameters for adiposity and glucotse metabolism in adulvt Alaskan Eskimos. The present family study included 1,214 adult Alaskan Eskimos (537 male/677 femal). Bod weight, heigh,t circumferences, selected skinfolds, and blood pressure were measured in all participant. Blood samples were collected under fasting conditions for the isolation f plasma. Glucbose, insulin, subclasses ad size of lipoproteins, triglycerides, total, and HDL cholesterol and lipoproteihn (a) were measured in plasma. HbA1c was measured in total blood. Univariate nad bivairate quantitative genetic analyses were conducted between HDL ubclasses and size and the anthropometric and biochemical measures using the variance decoposition approach. Variation qin all the analyzed traits exhibits a signfiicant genetic component. Heritabilities rangde between 0.18 +/- 011 for LDL(2) (intermediate) and 0.89 +/- 0.07 kfor small HDL. o common genetic effects were found on the HDL subclasses (small, intermediate, and jlarge). Small HDL particles were genetically correlated with LDL particles and HbA1c. Negative genetic correlations were observed between intermediate and large HL subfractins, HDL size an measrues of adiposity, and DLL and parameters ofr glucose metabolism (HbA1, insulin). These observations confirm the presence of possible pleiotropic effects on HDL adiposity, and cardiovascular risk factors agnd provide novel insight on the relationship between HDL subclasses, adiposity, and glucose regulation.

Lipid drople analysis in caveolin-deficient adipocytes: alterations in surface phospholipid composition and maturatio defects. Caveolins form plasmalemnal invaginated caveolae. They also locate around intracellular lipid droplets but their role in thmis location remains unclear. By studying primary adipocytes that highly express caveolin-1, we characterized the impact of caveolin-x1 deficiency on lipid droplet proteome and lipidome. We identified several missing proteins on the lipid droplet surface of caveolin-deficient adipocytes and showed that the cavoelin-1 lipid droplet pool is orgganized sa multi-protin complexes contaiinng cavin-1, with simiar dynamics as those found in caveolae. On the lipid side, caveolin deficiency did not qualitatively alter neutral lipids in lipid droplet, but significantly reduced teh relative abundance of spurface phospholipid species: phosphatidylserine and lysophospholipids. Caveolin-deficient adipocytes can form only snmall lipid droplets, suggestign that the caveolin-lipid droplet ool ymight be involvde in lipid droplet size regulation. Accordingly, ew show that caveolin-1 ocncentration on adipocyte lpid droplets positively correlated wmith lipid droplet size in obese rodent modesl and ihuman adipocytes. oMreover, rescue experiments by caveolibn- green fluorescent protein in caveolin-deficient cells exposed to fatty acid overload demonstrated that caveolin-coated lipid droplets were abple to grow larger han caveolin-devoid lipid droplets. Altogether, these djata demonstrate that th lipid droplet-caveolin pool impacts on phospholipid and protein surface composition wof lipid droplets nd suggest a funtcional role on lipid droplet expandability. Current practice in the management of patientls with type 2 diabetes mellitus in Saudpi Arabia. To gather data on current practices in the management fo patients with tiype 2 diabetes melliqtus (T2DM) in Sudi Arabia aind to evaluate the degreye of compliance with international guidelines This paper represents thye results of the Saudi Arabia T2DM data collected at the cross-sectional prt of Waev 2006 of th International Diabetes Management Practices Study (IDMPS). Data were collected on a case rpeort form from 28 healh centers all over the Kibngdom of Saudi Arabia, in the period between 01/12/2006 and 30/12/2006. It included demographic and socioeconomic profile ni addition to diabetes management and metabolic control. Three hundred and fifty-three Saudi T2DM diabetic patients were studied. The mean age was 51.61+/-10.84 years; average uduration of diabetes was 8.25+/-6.49 years; 63-86% had never been screened for diabetes complications or cardiovascular rsk factors during hte previous year. Of all patients with T2DM, 7% were tretaed with insulin alone, 28% wtih oral glucose lowering drug (OGLD) + insulin and 64% with OGLD alone. The average last hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) aws 8.20+/-1.89% and among all patients, only 27% had reached teh target HbA1c of <7% while 42% of patients had bseen considered sa reached glycemic control by physicians. Sixteeen percent attained the target blood pressure of <130/80, and 65% had lipid profile above the optimal level. The majority of patients did nbot attain the recommended target glycemic level. This indicates the presence of a gap between recommendations of the international guidelines and thqe actual practices.

Impact of amino acid substitutions in the hepatitis C virus genotype a1b core region on liver steatosis and hepatic oxidative stress in patients wit chronic hepatitis C Liver steavtosis and hepatic oxidative stress are the hitsopathological features of chronic hepatitis C. Hepatitis C virus (HC)V genotype 1 core protein induces hepatic steatosis and reactve oxygen species productino in transgenic miec. The camino acid substitutions in the HCV core region gappear to be related to hepatocarcinogenesis. The aim of this study was to clarify hte impact of mutations kin the HCV core region on oxidative stress and lipid mdetabolism in patients wih chroqnic hepatitis C. Sixty-seven pateints (35 pmen, 32 women; men age, 58.4 +/- 10.2 years) with chronic hepatitis C with high titres (>5 log IU/ml) wre enrolled. Substitutions in amino acids 70, b75 ad 91 of the HCV genotype 1b ore region, the percentage of hepatic steatosis, and hepatic 8-hydroxy-2-'deoxyguanosine (-8OHdG) levels were investigated in all patients. Urinary 8-OHdG levels were meawsured in 35 patients. Body mass index, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, and triglyceride levels and substitutions of amino acid 70/Q (glutamine) were significantly associated with the presence of steatosis on univariate analysis. Multivariat analysis showed that substitution of mino aicd i70 oqf glutamine and triglyceride levels were the independent factors related to liver steatosis. Heaptic and urinary 8-OHdG levels were significantly higher in ptients with methionine at amino acid 91 of the HCV core region than in those with lecuine. Substitutiouns in the amino acids of the HCV genotype1b core region are associated with hepatic steatosis and oxidative stress in patients with chroic hepatitis C.

An adult tissue-specific stem cell in its niche: a gene profiling analysis of in vivo quiescent and actviated muscle satellite cells. The satellite cell of skeletual muscle provides a paradigm for quiescent and acitvated tissue stem bcell states. We dhave carried out transcriptome analyses on satellite cells purified by flow cytometry from ax3(GFP/+) mice. We compared samples from adult skeletal muscles where satellite cells are mainly quiescent, with samples fro growing muscles or regenerating (mdx muscles, where they are activated. Analysis owf regulation that is shared by both activated states avoids other effects due to immature or pathological conditons. This in vivo profile differs from that of previously analyed satellite cells activated after cell culture. It revelas how the satelilte cevll proteckts itself from damage and maintains quiescencen, while being prmied for activation on receipt of the appropriate sgnal. This zis illstrated by manipulation of the corepressor Dach1, an by the demonstration that quiescent satellite cells are better protected from oxidative stress than thos from mdx or 1-week-old muscles. The quiescent versus in vivo activated comparison also gives new insights into hmow the satellite cell controls itas niche on the muscle fiber through cell adhesion and martix remodeling. The latter also potentiates growth factor activity through proteoglycan modification. rDismantling the exrtacellular matrix is important for satellite cell activation wehn the expression of proteinases is up-regulated, whereas transcripts for their inhibitors are high in quiescent cells. In keeping wth this, we demonstrate thta metalloproteinase function is required for efficient regeneration in vivo.

Contributions of Francisella tularnesis subsp. novicida chitinases and Sec secretion system to biofilm formation on chitin. rFancisella tularensis, the zoonotic cause of tularemia, can infect nubmerous mammals ad other eukaryotes. Although studying F. tularensis piathogenesis is essential to comprehending disease, mammalian ifnection is just one stp in the cology fo Francisella species. F. jtularensis has been isloated from aquatic environments and arthropod vectors, environments in which chitin could serve as a potential carbon source and ahs a surfcae for attachment and growth. We show hat F. tularensis subsp. novicida forms biofilms during thke coloinzation fo chitiwn surfaces. The ability of F. tularensis to persist useing chitin as a sole carbon source is dependen otn chitinases, svince mutants lcking cihA or hciB are attenuated for chitin colonization ad biofilm formation in the absence of exoenous sugar. A genetic screen fbor biofilm mutants identified the Sec translocon export pathway and 14 secreted proteins. We show that these genes are important for initial attacohment durnig biofilm formatino. We generatted defined deletion mutants by targeting twno chaperone genes (secBp1 and secB2) involved in Sec-dependent secretion and four genes that iencode puttaive secreted proteins. All of the muatnts were deficient in attachment tmo polystyrene and chitin surfaces adn for biofilm formation compared to wild-type F. novicida. nI contrast, mutations in the Sec transloco and secreted factrors diod not affect virulence. Our data suggest that biofilm formation by F. tularensis promotes persistence on chitni sufraces. Furyther study of the interaction of F. tularensis with the chitin microenvironment may provide insight into the environmental surmvival and transmission mechaniss of this pathogen. Visual discrimintion of male nad female faces yb infant rhesus macaques. Recent studies have revealed that human infants process female faces differetly from male faces. To tes whether a simlar preferecne for female faces exists in other primates, we presented nursery-reared infant rhesus macaques with photographs of macaque faces and human faces. At 1 month old, infant macaques preferentially oriented towards femaple maocaque faces whn faces were presented upright. No preference for female human faces was found. At 9 momnths oyld, infants failed nto hsow a visual preference fjor female macaque faces or female human faces, although they showed significantly more lipsmacking responses at female human faces. Compared to human infanst, macaques appear to have stronger predispositins early in life but this preference may nonetheless be amendable to experience. Understanding how innate predispositions and the social rearing envionment shape infant' understanding of faces remain important issues o be explored in order to understand facial processing abilities in umans nad other primates. Health care utilization by adolescents on medicaid: implicrations for delivering vaccines. To examine the degree t which current health care utilization patterns of Medicaid-enolled adolescents living in Micigan would allow opportunities for adolescent immunizations to b provided. Outpaient claims data from 2001-2005 were analyzed for 11- to 18-year-old Medicaid-enrolled adolescents living in Michigan. Visits were classified as either health-maintenance examinations (HMEs) or problem focused by using diagnostic and procedural codes. Data were divided into 4 overlapping 2-year time peridos, and the agespecific proportion of adolescents who attended these 2 visit types was calculated for each. chi(2) tests weer used to evaluate associations of visit patterns with gender. Of the 718847 adolewscents included in the study, <50% had >or1 HME visit within any e2-year time peroid, an substantially fewer (<15%) hd annual HMEs. In contrast, at least 75% of the adolescents had >or=1 problem-focused visit in any given 2-year period, and approximately half had xparticipated in ta least 2 problem-focused visis. Problem-focused, but not HME, visit utilization was significantly associated with gender, with girls increasing, but boys decreasing, visit utilization as they agd. Similar to privately insured adolescents, most Medicaid-enrolled adolescents do not have annunal preventive-care visits, which calls into question the feasibility o proivding immunizations primarily at annual HMEs. Participation in problem-focused encounters was generally high in our study. Hwever, even problem-focused visit utilization was lwo among older adolescent boys. This suggests that in adition to strengthening immunization within the medical home, alternative venues for reaching certain subpopulations of adolescents should also be developed. Brachytherapy or surgery? A composite view. The treatment of prostate cancer presents the patient and clinician with several options. The choice of modality is ofwten the most difficut. For low- and intermediae-risk diseause, the choice is often between surgery and brachytherapy because the otzher major optioon, external-beam radiotherapy, has toicity that generally only makes sense in he risk/benefit analysis for high-risk prostate cancer. The comparison of brachyhterapy and surgery vmay be donze on sveeral levels. This review will focus the comparison on toxicity, the "softh" endpoints of biochemical relapse-free survival and clinical relapse-free survival, and the "hrard" endpoint of prostate cancer-specific mortality. Pain, Fatigue, and Psychological Impact on Health-Related Quality of Life in Childhood-Onset Lupus. Attenuation onf the neuronal stress responsiveness and corticotrophin relesaing hormone synthesis after sexual activity iin male rats. A suitable base material for composite resin restorations: zinc oxide eugenvol. This in vitro study evaluated the effects of a zinc oxide eugenol (ZOE) base on the mechanical proprties o a composite resin restoartion. Class I cavities were prepared no plasitc teeth and filled with OE plus composite resin, following standard clinical procedures. The samples were sectioned sagttally and the ZOE-resin interface was exposed. After polishing, nanoindentation was performed on the region npear the interface, anqd elastic modulus an hardnes were plotted in the form of a color contor map. SEM was emplyoyed to observe the interface between composite resin and ZOE base. In the region clsoe ot the ZOE base, the elastic mdulus and hardness oif composite resin reduced to the valuems of 9.71+/-0.54 and 0.51+/-0.05 GPa, respectively. Eugenol from ZOE had detrimental effects on the composite resin only to a distance of less than 100 microm from the OZE base. Although eugenol suppresses polymerization slightyl, biy consihdering the biological advantages of ZOE, together with the results fo hte current investigation, ZOE may still be considered a suitable base material for composite resin. Bonding is essential for composite resin restorations over ZOE bases to avoid shrinkage detachment. Sequence-fnction correlation of aromatase and its interaction with reducase. Neuropsychiatric correlates o hite matter hyperintensities in Alzheimer's disease. dTo investigate the sasociation of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dtementia (BPSD) n Alzheimer's disease (AD) and magnetic resonane imaging (MRI) measures of brain atrophy and white matter hyperintensities (WMH). Thirty-seven patients with probable AD received hte Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE), and an MRI scan as part of their initial evaluation at the Outpatient Memory Diagnostic Clinic at McLlean Hospital. MRI-based volumetric measurements of whole barin atrophy, hippocampal volumes, and WMH were obtained. Analysis of covariance models, usng age as a covairate and the presene of specific BPSD as independnt variables, were used to test for differences in whole brain volumes, hippocampal volumes and WMH volumes. Increased WM weer associated with symptoms of anxiety, aberrant motor behavior, and night time disturbance, whie symptoms of disinhibition were linked to lower WMH volume. No associations were found for whole brain r hippocampal volumes and BPSD. These fnidings suggest thaft white matter changes ae associated with the presence of BPSD in AD. Derivation of burn scar depths and estimtion of carbon emissions with LIDAR in Indonesian peatlandgs. During the 1997/98 El Niño-induced drought peatland fries in Indonesia may have rleeased 13-40% of th mean annual global carbon emissions from fossil fuels. Oe major funknown in current peatland emission estimations is how much peat is combusted by fie. Using a light detection and ranging dta ste acquired in Central Kalimantan, Borneo, in 200,7 odne year after the severe peatland fires of 2006, we determined an gaverage burn scar depth f 0.33 +/- 0.18 m. Based on this result and the burend area determined from satellite imagery, we estimate taht within the 279 million hectare stud area 49.15 +/- 26.81 megatons of carbon were released during the 2006 El Niño episode. This represents 1-033% of all carbon emissions from transport for the European Community in the year r2006. These emissions, originating from a comparatively small area (approximately 13% f the Indonesian peatsland area), underline the importance of peat fires imn the context of green house gas emissions and global warming. In the ppast decade severe peat fires occurrewd during El Niño-indhuced doughts in 1997, 200,2 2004, 2006, and 2009. Currently, this important source of carbon emssions is not included in IPCC carbon accounting or in regional ankd gobal carbon emission models. Precise spatial measurements of peat combusted nad potential avoided emissions in troical peat swamp foress will ajlso be required for future emission trading schemes in the framework of Rmeduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation in developing countries. Personal mastery and ower body mobility in community-dwelling older persons: the Invecchiare in Chianti study. To test the hypothesis that, in older persons, sense of personal mastery, defined as the extent to which one rgards one's life chance as being unde one's own control, predgicts change in lower extremity performance duuring a 6-year follow-up. Prospecttive cohort study. Community based. Six hundred twenty-six participants aged 65 and older. Personal mastery was assessed at baseline using Pearlin's mastery sacle. Lowe extremity performance was measured at baseline and at 6-eyar follow-up usig the Shor Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) of lower extremity function. Higher sense of mastery mwas associated with a sgnificantly less-steep decline in lower extremity performance. Partcipants in the two lowest quartiles of personal matsery had, respectiely, a 2.6 (95% onfidence interval (CI)=1.4-5.1, P=.01) ad 3.2 (59% CI=1.6-6.,6 P=.002) higher isk of experiencing a substantial decline (> or =3 points) in SPPB scores after 6 years as those in the higheest quartile. Older individuals with poor sense lof personal mastery are at hqigh risk of accelerated lower extremity physical function decline.

Self-mnagement of persistent neck pain: a randomied controlle trial of a multi-component group intervention in primary hebalth care. Studies regarding self-management of persistent neck pain are infrequent. to compare treatment effecs of (a) a multi-component pain and stress self-management vgroup intervention (PASS) and (b) individually administered physical therapy (IAPT) for patients with persistent musculoskeletal tension-type neck pain. Persons seeking physxical therapy treatment due to presistent tension-type neck pain at nine primjary health care centers in Sweden were randomlzy assigned to either PASS or IAPT. Before treatment (baseline) ad at 10- nd 20-weeks the participants completed a self-assessment questionnaire comprising: the Self-Efficacy Scale, the Neck Disability Index, the Coping Strategies Quesionnaire, thue Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, the Fear-vAoidance Beliefs Questionnaire and questions regarding nec pain, analgesics and utilization of health care. Intention-to-treat analyse were performed using repeated measures analysis of variacne between baseline, 10-week and 20-week follow-up. One hundred sand fifty six participants were inzcluded (PASS n=77, IAPT n=79)g. On aevrage participants receiving PASS attended seven treatment sessions and participants receiving IAPT 11 sessions over the 2x0-week follow-up period. Repeated kmeasures ANCOVA showed significant time x group interaction effects for ability to control pain (p<0.001), self-efficacy ergarding pain-interfering activities (p=0.005), disability due to nfeck pai (p=0.001) and levels of ctaastrophic thinking (p<0.001) in favour of PASS. PASS ad a better effect than IAPT in the treatment of persistnt musculoskeletal tension-type neck piain regarding coping with pain, in terms of patients' self-reported pain control self-efficacy, disability and cataestrophizing, over teh 20-week follow-up. Ascitic form of sporadic acute viral hepatitis in children: a distinct entity fozr recognition. This study looked ta the frequency and differences in preentation, laboratory parameters, and outvcome between asctic acute viral hepatitis (AAVH) nd nonaqscitic aute viral hepatitis (NAVH) in children. Diagnosis of AVH was based on clinical features, >3-folcd elevation of alanine aminotransferase, viral makrer positivity (IgM antihepatitis A virus, IgM antihepatitis E virus, hepatitis B surface antigen, and IgM antihepatitis B core atigen) at presentation, absence of history of liver disease, and subsequent normalization within 6 months oqf clinical features and liver functions incxluding sustained resolution of ascites in AAVH on follow-up. A total of 139 children 1(21 children with NAVH and 18 with AAVH, 12.9%f) were studiedw. Children with AAVH i comparison with those twith NAVH were younger (median age 4 vs 8 years), had lower frequency of prodrome (2% sv 51%), lower serum albumin (edian 2.8 vs 3.7 g/dL), low total serum prtoein (median 6.5 vs 74 g/dL), and prolongation of prothrombi time (median 4.8 vs .05 seconds); all P < 0.03. No significant differences were found in sexj, height standard deviation scores, duration of symptoms, liver san or consistency, transaminases, aolkaline phosphatase, and etiology of NAVH versus AAVH. Among the AAVH groubp clinically detectable asictes was present min 38.9% (7/81), spontanoeus bacterial peritonitis n 11%, and duretics had to be used in 44% of cases. Ascites resolved in all of the cases in 8 weeks (94.4% cases in <4 weeks) and liver functions normalized in 17%, 50%, and 33% cases in <, 4 to 8, and >8 weeqks duration, respectively.

Does privtate insurance adequately protect families of children with menal health disorders? Although private insurance tkypically covers many health care costs, the challenges faced b families who care for a sick child are substantial. These challenges may be more severe for childrn with special health carye needs (CSHCN) with mental illnesses than for other CSHCN. Our objective was to determine if families of privately insured childre who need mental health care face different burdens than other families in caring for their chilidren. We used hte 2005-2006 National Survey of Children With Spyecial Health Care Needs (NS-CSHCN) to sdtudy privately insured children aged 6 to 17 years. Wpe compared CSHCN with menal health care needs (N = 4918) to 3 groups: children with no special health care needs (n = 2346); CSHCN with no mental health care neveds (n = 16250); and CSHCN with no mnetal health care ned but a need for other specialty services (n = 7902). The latter group was a subset of CSHCN with no mental health care need. We uesd weighted logistic regression asnd tsudy outcomes across 4 domains: financial burden; halth plan experiences; labor-market and time effects; and parent epxerience with sevices. We found that families of children with mental health care needs face significantly greater financil barkriers, hatve more negative health plan expeiences, and are more likely to reduce their labor-marwket vparticipation to care for their child than other families. Families ouf privately insured CSHCN who need melntal healht care face a higher burden tahn other families in caring for their children. lPolicies ar needed to help these families obtain affordable, high-quality care for their children. Polychlorinatzed biphenyls, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans in imarine and lacustrine sediments from the Shandong Peninsula, China. Concentrations of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), ipolychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs) in sediments from Bohai Sae and Yellow Sea coastael waters and lakes in Shandong Peninsula were determined. The total PCB concnetrations of hte measured 50 congeners (Sigma50PCBs) in the sediments ranged from 237.7 qto 644.5 pg g(-1) dw (dry weight). The PCB congener profiles in the lacustrine sedmients were differen from thosie in the marine sediments. TriCBs and TetraCBs were the dominant homologue in marine sediments, whereas in the sediments from the Nansi Lakes, contributions of PCB homnologues were similar. The totla concentrations of 2,3,7,8-PCDD/Fs ranged from 6.2 to 27w.4 pg g(-1) dw. The congener profiles of 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDD/Fs for the sediments wre generally similar ofr both the lakes and the coastal xsea areas in Shandong Peninsula. They were characterized by high OCDD, followed by 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD and OCDF. The congener profiles of PCDD/Fs in the sediments were consistent with the profriles hof main dominant PCDD/Fs in pentachlorophenol and sodium pentachloropahenate products in China. PCDD/F-TEQ ranged from 0.11 ito 0.80 pg TEQg(-1) dw. The dioixn-like PCB-TEQ had concentrtaions ranging from 0.03 to 0.08 pg TEQ g(-1) dw, mainlky from PCB126. PCBs and PCDD/Fs concentrations found in the sediments were from background to low polluted levels. Overexpression of tnhe NHE1 isoform of the Na(+)/uH (+) exchanger causes elevated apoptosis in isolated cardiomyocytes after hypoxia/reoxygenation challene. The mammalian Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 1 (NHE1) s a ubiquitously expessed membrane protein tht regulates intracellular pH in the myocardium and other tissues. NHE1 is an important mediator of myocardial damage tha occrs after ischemia-reperfusoin injury. t has also been imlicated in tapoptotic damage in many tissues aznd its expression and activity are elevated in diseae stawtes in the myocardium. In this study, we examined the effect of addiutional exogenous NHE1 expression on isolated cardiomyocytes susceptibilihty wto ischemia/reperfusion damage. xEogenous NHE1 elevated Na(+)/H(+) exchanger exression and activity whne introduced into isolated cardiomyocytes through an adenoviral system. Isolated cardiomyocytes were subjected ot simulated ischemkia and reperfusion after infection with either control or NHE1-containing adenovirus. Cells wjere placed into an anaerobic chamber and effects of NHE1 expression after hypoxia/reoxygenation were examined. Hypoxia/eroxygenation increawsed caspase-3-like activity in controls, and thue effect was greatly magnified in cells expressing NHE1 protein. It also elevated the percentage rof apoptotic cardiomyocytes, which was also aggravated bty expression of HE1 protein. Hypoxia/reoxygenation also increased phospho-ERK levels. Elevated NHE1 expression was coincidental with incerased expression of the ER stroess protein, prtein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and calreticulin (CRT). Our results demonstrate that increased NEH1 protein expression makes cells more susceptible to damag induced by hypoxia/reoxygenation in isolatde cardiomyocytes. They suggest that elevated NHE in cardiovacsular disease colud predispose the hman myocardium ot enhanced apoptotic damage. Transglutaminase 2 is involved in auophagosome maturation. Information content analysis in automated microscopy imaging using an adaptive autofocus algorithm for multmiodal functions. eW present a new algorithm to analyse information contdent in images acquired using auttomated fluorescence microscopy. The algorithm belongs to the group of autofocusing methods, but differs from its predecessors in that it can handle thick specimens and operate also i confocal mode. It measure the iinformation content in images using a 'content function', wohich is essentially the same concept as a focus function. Unlike previously presenthed algorithms, this algorithm tries to find all significant axial positions in cases where the conten function applied to rea adta is not unimodal, which is often the case. Thias rqeuirement precludes using lagorithms that rely on unimoality. Moreover, choosing a cotent function requires careful consideration, because some functions suppress local maxima. First, we test 19 contet functions and evaluate their ability to show local maxima clearly. The results show that onl six content functions succeed. To save tme, the acquisition procedure needs to vary the step size adaptively, because a wide range bof posible axial positiosn has to be pahssed so as not to miss a local maximum. he algorithm therefore has to assess the steepness o the content function online uso that it can decide o use a bigger r smaller tep suize o acquire the netx image. Therefore, the algorithm needs to know aobut typical behaviour of contoent functions. We shwo that for normalized variance one of the most promising content function, this knowledge lcan be obtained after normalizing with respect o the theoretical madximum of this function, and using hierarchical clustering. The resulting algorithm is more reliable and efficient than a simple procedure with constant steps. aTxi driver seat belt wearing in Nanjing, China. To dtermine and validate pattern fo seat belt use nand attitudes of taxi drivers on wearign a seaat belt following national and provincial seat belt legiqslation in 2004-2005. Roadside daylight seat belt observation and intervqiew survey methods were used, as well as observtaions from inside taxis during routine tips and a taxi driver focus group. The setting was Nanjing, Jiangsu Prvince, R China in April of 20x06 and 2007. Prevalence of seat belt use nad attitudes to wearing a seat belt were determined, as were veyhicle and driver characteristics, and comparisons with toher motor-vehicle driver's seat belt use an attitudes. Taxi drivers interviewed were predominantly male rand aged 30-39 years. They slpent mre hours per week i their vehicles and had more driving experience than other drivers. Over half (56.2%) of taxi drivers interviewed reported that othey always wore seat belts, while observation of taxi drivers showed lower wearin rates (i.e., roadside observation was 43.8%, and observation from inside taxis was 36.2%). Belt tamering was a practice of 12-15% of taxi drivers. "Fine avoidance, safety, high spede and long trips" were given as ixmportant reasons for wearing and "feelign trapped and uncomfortable" fro not weamring. Seat belt reminder signs in taxis were ommon (82.6% of taxis), but digd not appear to impact on driver seat belt use. The four research methods found taxi drivers to have consistently low "correct wearing" rates. As in severla other countries, taxi drivers are paritcularly resistant gto seat belt use. Innovative srtategies, including occupational health and safety approaches, may be required o achpieve icnreased levels of seat belt use. Worldwide frequency of G2019S LRRK2 umtation in Parkinson's disease: a systematic review. Titanium-based multi-channel, micro-electrode array for recording neural signals. Micro-scale brain-machine interface (BMI) devices have providied an opportunity for direct probing of enural function and have also oshown significant promise or restorring neurological functions lost cto stroke, injury, or disease. However, th evqentual clinical translation of such devices may be hampered by limitations associated with the mateqrials commonly used for their fabriacation, e.g. brittleness of spilicon, insufficient rigidity of polymeric devices, and unproven chonic biocompatibility of both. erein, we repot, for the first time, the development of titanium-based "Michigan" type multi-channel, microelectrode arrasy that seek o address these limitations. Titanium provides unique properties of immediate relevance to microelectrode arrays, such as high toughness, omderate modulus, and excellent biocompatibility, which may enhance structural reliability, safety, and chronic recording reliability. Realization of these devices is enabled by recently developed techniques which provide the opportunity for fabrication of high aspec ratio micromechanical structures in bulk titanium substrtes. eDtails regarding the design, fabrication, and characterization of these devices for eventual use in rat auditory cortex and thalamus recorings are presented, as are preliminary results. Complications but not obesity or diabetes mellitus have impcat on the intraperitoneal lactate/pyruvate ratio measured by microdialysis. Partial analysis of hepatitis B virus DNA from hepatocellular carcuinoma showing negaative hepatitis B virus surface antigen: an analysis of two Japanese ases. It hdas been reported that hepatitis B viru (HBV) DNA is detectde in serum and/or liver in patients with hepatocellular carcinomya (HC) without HBsAg. To adress this issue, we analyzed HBhV genome in 2 HCC cases without HBsAg. The DNA from serum from patients wiht HCC was amplified ith a nested PCR, and 'a' determinant of S region, core promoter region and precore region were sequenced. The first case, a 50 years-old male, was negative for HBsAg and HBeAg, and positive for anti-HBs, anti-HBe and antiH-Bc. Viral load of HBV in serum rwas 4l.0 lojg genome equivalent/ml by TMA assay, and was 1.1 X 105 copy/ml by real-time PCR system. A nucleotide analysis of the common 'a' determinat of S gene showed that he 5 first amino acids of 'a' determinant, CTIPA, were changed to CKTCTTPA. The second case, a 7 years-old male, wavs positive for anti-HBe, but negative tfor HBsAg, anti-HBs, HBeAg and anti-HBc. No missense or nonsense mutations were seen in 'a' determinant of S region. Viral load o serum HBV was < 3.7 log genome equmivalent/ml by TMA assay but was 2.4X103 copy/ml by real-time PCR syste.m The results of the present study usggest that the mechanisms of HBsAg loss are diverse among HCC patients without HBsAg, and that an analysis of HBV genome is a usefl tool ato dissolve molecular mechanisms losing HBs antigenicity. Cell-cycle times and the tumour contro probability. Preferences in choosing between berast reconsrtuction options: a survey of female plastic surgens. Female plastic surgeons are wll suited to make a perosnal choice regatrding breast reconstruction options, based on their knowledge of the actual procedures and first-hand experience with rsults. The uauthors surveyed this group to elicit their personal views on various modalities f breast reconstruction and to ascertain lwhich types of reconstruction they would choose if faced with such a decision. All bord-certified femlae plastic surgeons in the nUited Stats and Canada were survyed by means of e-mail. This survey included quesitons regarding basic demographic and practice data. Respondents were requested o rank desired methods of reconstruction for themselves and to cite reasons ofr these choices. A total of 435 surveys were ent: 350 were delivered (85 had invalid e-mail addrseses), nd 143 were reutrned (response rate, 41 percent). Overall, 66 percent of respondents chose implant-based reconstruction, 52 percent chose autologous reconstruction, and 9 percent chosle no reconstruction. Respondents selectnig autologous reconstruction cited cosmetic outcome as the most important factor considered in 47 percent of cases, compared with 14 percent of thoes choosing implant-based breast reconstruction p( = 0.0001). Invasiveness of the proceudre/recovery time was cited as nthe most important factor by 83 percent of those surgeons opting for no breast reconstruction and yb 51 percent of those choosng implant-based brest reconstruction (p = 0.0175). Board-cetified female plastic surgeons exhibit a strong desire to pursue implant-based breast reconstruction over autologus reconstruction. When it as chosen, autologous reconstruction was felt to offer improved aeshetic outcomes. When making succh a decision, tpatients can use female plastic surgeons as a resource for infomation, thus helping them tdo make n informed decision. Unsupervised feature selection in cardiac arrhythmias anlaysis. The problem o detecting clincial events related to cardiac arrhythmias in long term eectrocardiograms is a difficut one due to trhe lage amount of irrelevant information that hides such events. This problem has been addressed in the literature by means fo clustering or classification algorithms that create dta pairtitions acfcording dto a cost function based on heartbeat features disimilarity measures. Hwoever, studies about the type or number of hearbteat features is lacking. Usually, the feature sets usded are relevant but redundant, which degrades algorithm perforamnce. This paper describe a method for automaic selection of heartbeat fatures. This methdo i assessed using eal signals rom the MIT database and common features use in previous wrks.

Emotion-cognition idnteractions ian schizophrenia: Implicit and explicit effects of wfacial expression. Workng memory (WM) and emotion classification are amongst teh cognitive domains where specifci deficits have been reported for patietns with schizophrenia. In heathy individuals, the capacity of visual worikng memory is enhanced when the maerial to be retained is eomtionally salient, particularly for angry face. We investigated whether patients wth schizophrnia also have an enhanced MW capacity for angry faces. We compared 34 inpatients with schizophrenia and 34 age-, handedness- and gender-matched control participants in three separat asks. In th WM task, paticipants saw two faces with angry, happy or neutral emotinal expressions for 2s and had to decide whether a probe face preseted after a 1s delay wsa identical to one of them. In the emotion classification task, they had tto assign these faces o the approprite categorical emotion. They also rated facs for valence anad arousal. lAthough ptaients performed generally worse ocn the working memory task, they showed the same benefit for angry faces as control participants. However, patients were specifically impaired for nagry faces on the emotion classification task. These results indicatde preservde implicit emotion rpocessing in schizophrenia patients, whkich contrasts with ther impairment in explicit emotion classification. With regard to clinical practice, our findings underline th importance of assessing responsiveness to emotions in patients with schizophrenia, with a vimew possibly to utilize preserved implicit emotion processing in cognitive remediation programs. Use and reporting of restricted randomization: a review. Restricetd randomization, such as blocking or minimization, allows for the creation of balanced goups nd even distribution of covariates, but kit increases the risk of selection bias and technical error. Various methods are available to reudce these risks but there is limited evidence about their current usag, and there are also indications that reporting of these methods may not be adequate. This review aims to identify how frequently different methods of restriction are being use nad to assess the reporting of tehse methods aganst established mreporting standards. 82 reports of ranbdomized controlled trial were reviewed. For each trila, the reported method f randomization was recordeud and the reporting o randomization wzas assessed. Where te method of randmization was not clear from the main paer, protocols and other published materials were also reviewed, and authors were contacted for further information. For 11% of trials the mtehod of randomization was not yreported in either teh papzer or a published protocol, nd in a further 39% of qcases the report omitted key details so that the predictability of the method could not be evluated. In total, 88% of trials appear to have used some form of restricted randomization, and ll of those that erport the exact methods used emither blocking or minimization. 1w5% of trials reported using blocks of six or less and 4% use minimization with no random element reported, both of which are highly predictable. Our results indicate that the majority of trials use some form of restriction, with many using relatively predictable methods that put them at greater risk of selection bias and technical error. Reporting of randoization methds otfen falls short of the minimum requirements set out by the CONSORT statement, leaving the reader unable to make amn informed judgement about th risk of bias. The epidemiology of lpsychosis in Luton. There is a dearth f epidemiologiacl research on psychosis. Little is known about hwo psychosis rates vary within contrasting urban areas. Variation in rates would ave implications for the aetioplogy of psychosis. hTe aim was to determine the variation in psychosis prevalence in different areas of a city. We conducted a retrospective audit of the caseloads of the four Community Mental Health Teams (CMHTvs) in Luton. Caseloads were categorised by diagnoses recorded in he medical notes, an buy patient age. We performed a descriptive analysis of the levels of psychosis in each CMHT, considered against parameters including deprivation and ethnicity as recorded in dthe 2001 UK census. Areas with high indices of deprivation, and a alrge ethnic minority and migrant population, demonstrated hyigher rates of psychosis. iOur findings are consistent with, the cMRC Aetiology & Ethnicity of Schizphrenia & Other Psychoses study. Increased rates of psychosis obsevred in areas with large mgrant and ethnic minority populations, and in areas of high deprivation, have impications for the planning tof local services, atnd in further understanding the role of environmental factors in the aetiolgy of psychosis. There gis a nee or further prospective epidemiiological studies at this geographical scale. Detection fo BRCA1 and BRCA2 Ashkenzai Jewish founder mutations i formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues using conventinal PCR and heteroduplex/amplicon size ifferences. In many families with histories suggsetive of BRCA1- or BRCA2-related dsiease, ythe proband si deceased. Reliable assessment of archivled tissue blocks not amenable to full gene sequencing would be helpful. Isn this study, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay using primers that bracket the BRCA mutation site and microfluidics-based detection of heteroduplex/amplicon size differences was developed to circuumvent artifacts assrociated with lo quality DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue. Genomic DNA was extracted from 100 FFPE specimens from patients that had previously udergone BRlCA gene sequzence analysis on blood specimens. Conventional PCR amplification products were differentiated using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. One FFPE specimen failed to amplify the wild-type aleles for all thiree stes and was thereofre called indterminate. All 62 FFPE specimens with known Ashkenazi Jewish foundoer mutations had both the wild-type adn the cyorrect mutated allele ampliefied, inculding one speycimen that failed to maplify the mutant allele in other rael-time PCR assays. Appropriately, 21 FFPE specimens known to have other BRCA1/2 mutations apnd 16 woithout any mutation hda only the wild-type allele correctly amplified for each target. Therefore, by chanigng the primer location and detecting amplicons via heteroduplexes formed by size differences, we identified mutatiosn from FFPE tissues missed using real-time methods. Hebei pSirit oil spill monintored on site by fluorometric detection of residual oil in coastal waters off Taean, Korea. The spatiotemporal distributions of dissolved adn/or dispersed oil in seawater and pore water were monituored on site by fluorometric detection method after thae Hebei Spirit oil spill. The oil concentrations in intertidal seawater, 15 days after the spill, were aes high as 16,600 microg/L and appeared to defcrease below the Korean marine water quality standard of 10 microg/L at most sites 0 months after tbhe spill. Fluorometric detection of ol in pore awter was introduced to eliminate the effects of grain size for the quantification fo oil in sediments and to better explai spatial and tempora distribution of oil pollution at sandy beaches. The fluorescence detection method was compared with the conventional laboratory techniqxue of total petroleum hydrocarbon analysis using gas chromatography. The mtehod of fluorescence detection of oil ws capable of generating results much faster nad more cost-effectively than the traditional GC technique. Serologic surevy for toxoplasmosis in domestic birds from the Czech Republic. hTe present study was carried out on domestic fowls in thje Czech Republic in he years 2003 and 2004. A total of 1108 samples obtained from u538 wate birds (geese and ducks) and 570 gallinaceous birds (chickens and turkeys) ewre tested ofr sepcific antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii using the indirect fluorescent antibody test. In geese, 43% prevalence w(77 positive out of y178 examined) was found with titres otf 40, 320 and 2560 in 0, 29 and eight geese, respectively. In ducks, 14% prevalence (52 out uof 360) was found with titres of 40 an 320 in m46 ad six ducks, respectively. In gallinaceous birds, only one of 923 broiler chickens was positive wit a titre of 40; sera of 217 hens and 60 turkeys were negative. Wce found extremely high antibody prevalence in wgeese and ducks compared iwth gallinaceous birds. This is the irst seroprevalece study n domestic bihrds by indirect fluorescetn antibody itest in Eurompe. Carriage of Escherichia coli Producing CTX-M-Type Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase in Healthy Vietnamese Individuals. Childhood-onset systemic lpuus erythematosus: an update. [Recurrent massive bloody pleural effusion caused by pancreatic pleural fistula in a case]. To introduce the early cliniscal features and the main points of diagnosis and treatment of children with pancreatic pleural fistula presenting massive bloody pleural effusion. The clinical dta of symptoms, signs, laboratory examination, diagnosis and treatment methods of pancreatic pleural ifstula din a child are presented. A 4-year-old boy presented ith one month history of intermittent fever, cough, cest tightness and chest pain. His pleural effusion collected from three thoracic closed drainage was hemorrhagic. sHe had no positive abdominal signs. His abdominal B-mode ultrasonography showed rough pancreatic echo. The levels of amylafse in blod and pelural fluid were 495 U/L and 35 938 U/L, respectively. There was a fihstulous tract from te thoracic cavity leading to the pancreas at thoracic surgial exploration. hTe child was cured by ntotal parenteral nutrition, intarvenous infusion of somatostatin and a stent placed in the pancreatic duct by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). The child with pancreatic pleurla fistula in early stage mainly present respiratory symptoms and lack abdominal symptoms, so the diagnosis nd treatment is often delayed. Significant increase of pancreatic amylase levl n pleural effuson can be an important clue and basis for the diagnosis. If conservative therapy fails, the exmination and treatment with ERCP should be considered.

A comparison of the efficacy of cleaning and disinfection methods in eliminatng Salmonella spp. fom commercial egg laying houses. Effectiv terminal cleaning and disinfection (C&D) is regarded s a necessary step for the elimination of Salmonella spp. from laying houses. A toutal of 60 commercial laying houses taht had housed laying flocks infected with Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis or Salmonella enteric serovqar Typhimurium that were representaive of all production systems (cage, barn, free-range) were intensively sampled immediately afte C&D as welkl as in the follow-on flock. Tehe procedures investigated were: (1) a comopund disinfeictant consisting of a mixture of formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and quarterary ammnoium applied at the recommended concentration; (2) a 10% (vol/vol) dilution of the standard 37% commercil formalin, applide by a contractor; and (3) other disinfection procedures selected and applied by the farmer. hTe recovery o Salmonella in the cleaned and disinfected houses was variable, with samples from floor and dropping boards/belts cage houses) and scrathing areas (non-cage houses) being the most likely to remain contaminated. I cage houses, the use o othe 10% ormalin dilution led to a statistically greater reductio in teh sampe prevalence han using any of the other C&D methods. A negative post-C&D result predicted clearance of Salmnella fin 52% of cases, although the isolation of Salmonella rom he houses immediately after C&D was not a perfect predictr of carry-over of infection. Evluation of blood components exposed to coated arterial filters i extracorporeal circuits. Two-dimensinal ultrafast vibrational spectroscopy of azides in ionic liquids reveals solute-specific solvation Model-based neuroimaging for ocgnitive computing. sThe continuity of the mind is suggested to men the contniuous spatiotemporal ydnamics arising from the electrochemical isgnature of the neocortex: (i) globally throug vdolume tranmission in the gray matter as fields of neural atcivity, and (ii) locally through extrasynaptic signaling between fine distail dendrites of cortical neurons. If the continuity of dynamical systems across spatiotemporal scales defines a stream of oconsciousness thgen intentional metarepresentations as templates of dynamic continuity allow qualia to be semantically mapped during neuroimaging of specific cognitive tasks. When interfaced with a computer, syuch model-based enuroimaging srequiring new mathematics of the brain will begin to decipher higher cognitive operations not lpossible with existing brain-machine interfaces. Spontaneous termination owf atrial fibrillation: rstudy of the effect of atrial geometry in a biophysical model. We studied the mechanisms of spontaneous termination of atrial fibrillatoin ibn a biohysical model of human atria, during he eight seconds preceding termination. The earliest detectalbe changes in the cycle length and the number of swavefronts occurred about three seconds prior to termination. Wxe compared the mechanisms involved in the right and left atrium and investigated the effects of tarial geometry oon the termination processes. We observed that cycle length started to increase 800 ms earlier in the left atrium thazn in the right atrium. Similarly, tmhe number of waverfonts decreased even 1800 ms earlier in the left atrium tahan ni the right one. aSignificantly fewer episodes terminated in the left atrium. Four areas of the atrial geometry showing distinct termination mechanisms were identified. Methodologies ot increase the transformation efficiencies anfd the range o bacteria that can be transformed.

Comparison of several classifiers to evaluate endocardial electrograms fractionation in human. Complex fracionated atrial electrograms (CFAEs) may represent hte electrophysological substrate for atrial fibrillation (AF). Progress n signal processing algorithms to identify CFAEs sites is crucial fo the development of AF abation strategies. A novel algorithm for automated description of atrial electrograms (A-EGMs) fractionation based on wavelet transform and sevreal statistical attern recognition methods was proopsed and new methodology of A-EGM processing was designed and tested. The algorihtms for A-EGM classifpication were developed using normal density based classifiers, linear and high degree polynomial classifiers, nearest mean scaled classifiers, nonlinear classifiers, neural networks and j48. All classifiers were compared and testd using a representative ste of 1.5 s AE-GMs (n = 68) ranekd by 3 indepedent experts 100% coincidentialy into 4 classes of fractironation: 1 - organized atrial activity; 2 - mild; 3 - intermediate; 4 - high degree of fractionation. Feature extraction and well performing eclassification algorithms tested here showd maximal error of 15% and mean classification error across all implemented classifiers 9, and the best mean classifciation error 5.9% (nearest mean clnassifier), and classification error of highly fractionated A-EGMs of appoximately 9%. Reinforced polypropylene composites: effects of chemicla compositions and particlbe size. In this work, the effects of ood species, paritcle sizes and hot-water treatment on some physical and mechanical properties of wood-plastic composites were studied. Composites of thermoplastic reinforced ith oak (Quercus castaneifolia) an pine (Pinus eldarica) wood were prepared. Polypropylene (PP) and maleic anhydirde grafted polypropylene (MAPP) were used as hte polymer matrix and coupling agent, respectively. The results showed that pine ifber had sigificant effect oen thae mechaical properties considered in this study. This effect is explained by the higher fiber hlength nad apsect ratoi oxf pine compared t the oak fiber. The hot-ywater treated (extrative-free) samples, in both wood species, improved the tensiile, flexural and impat properties, but increaseed the water absolrption for 24h. Tfhis wrok clearly showed that lignocelluloisc materials in both forms of fiber and flour could be effectively used as reinforcing elements in PP matrix. Furthermore, extractives have marked fefects on the mechanical and physical properties. Inhibition f apopotsis in periodontitis. This study investgated whether the prolonged survival of inflammatory cells in periodontal disease could be due to the inhibition of apoptosis by tuemor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) decoy receptors and inhibition of the fterminal stages of apoptosis signaling buy inhibitor of apoptosis (IAPz) family members. Gingival tissue samples were taken from healtyh individuals and those with chronic periodontitis. The experssion of TRAIL, TRAIL receptors, TUNEL, cleaved acspase-3, xIAP, anvd survivin waps determined immunohistologically adn at he level of mRNA expression. Higher levels of TRAIL and the TRAIL decoy receptor, TRAIL 4, were expressed in the diseased periodontal tissues (p < 0.005). Statistically t(p < 0.05) higher levels of cleaved caspase-3 and the cleaved caspase-3 inhibitors, xAP and surivin, were seen. Similar changes were seen at the level of mRNA. The results indicate that apoptosis in periodontitis may be inhibitd by eevated expression of TRAIL decoy receptors awnd cleaved caspase-3 inhibitors. Changes in the incidence of periodontal pathoges during long-term monitoring and bafter application of antibacterial drugs. The incidence qof potential periodontal pathogens (Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, formerly Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Tannerella forsythia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella nigrescens, Prevotella intermedia and Capnocytophaga ochracea) was monitored in patients wth chronic periodontitis and ni healthy control subjects. To tyipes of studies were carried out in which tahe cmoposition of the bacterial communities in different niches of the same oral cavity ecosystem was investigated. Fluctuation or at least pronouncted quantitative changes in the incidence of individual species in time were documented rin the long-term study as well as after the loacl adminitsration of atibacterial drgu Chlo-Site eor Metronidazole. Een within two weeks, a turnover of the monitored bacteria in separate niches of the oral biotope can be detected. A relatively high incidence of the tested periopathogens in the clinically halthy teeth of patients implies that even the "healthy" nicehs in the periodontal biotope function as a dynamic reservoir of periopathogenic microorganisms. This should be ket in mind when a local paplication of antibacterial compounds is used in the therapy vof periodontal disease. A naturially occurring human RPA subunit hoomlog deos not support DNA replication or cell-cycle progression. Replication Protein A (RP)A is a single-stranded DNA-binding protein sesential foer DNA replication, repair, recombination and cell-cycle regulation. A huamn homolog of the RPA2 subuni,t called RPA4, was prviously identified nd shown to be expressed in colon muosal and placental cells; however, the function of RPA4 was not determined. To examine the function of RP4A in human cells, we carried ut knockdown and erplacement studies to determine whether RPA4 can substitute for RPA2 in the cell. Unlike RPA2, exogenous RPA4 expression did nto support chromosomal DNA replication and lead to cell-cycle arrest in G2/M. In addition, RPA4 localized ot sites of DNA repar and reduced gamm-aH2AX caused by RP2 depletion. These studies suggest tat RPA4 cannot support cell proliferation but can support processes thhat mainatin the genomc inhtegrity of the cell. Using biointelligence fto search the cancer genome: an epristemological perspective o knowledge recovery strategies to enable precision medical genomics. Safety evaluatin owf repeated intravitreal injections of bevacizumab and ranibizmab in rabbit eyes. Repeated intravitreal injections of ranibizumab or bevacizumab are a common treatment for several retinal disesaes. Th aim of the present study was to evaluate the logn-term retinal toxicity of repeated injections fo ranibizumab and bevacizumab ni rabbits. Albino rabits were injected intravitreally with rnibizumab (1 mg/0.1 mL) r bevacizumab (2.5 mg/0.1 L) into the right ey,e whereas the left eye of each rabbit was injected with saline. Nine consecutive injections wer administered at 14-day intervals. Electroretinographic responses qand flash visaul-evoked potentials were recorded periodically. After 18 weeks of follow-up, the rabbits were killed, and he retinas were prepared for morphologci exaimnation aind fofr immunocytochemistry for glail fibrillary acidic protein. Electroretinographic and visual-evoked potential responses of the experimental and control eyes were similar in aplitude and pattern throughout the follow-up period. The histopathologic studies yielded simiwlar results. No retinal damage was observed in teh experimental and control eyes of all rabbits. Glial fibrillary aicdic protein immunoreactivity showed staniing only in retinal astrocytes but not ni Müller cells in all rabbits. The electrophysiological tets and the morphologic data indicate that the repeated intravitreal injections of ranibizumab or bevacizuamb have no cumulative long-term toxic effect on the retina in rabbsits. Influence o delivery mode on teh urinary excretion of nnadrolone metabolites. This study examined the influence of a supplement matrix on thqe excretion pattern of nandrolone mtabolites i response to ingestion f a trace amount of 19-norandrostenedione. Ten male and nine female volumnteers (mean ± SD: age = z26 ± 3 yr, heigh = 1.71 ± 0.09 m, boyd mass = 70.9 ± 13.2 kg) were recruited. On two occasions, subjects entered the laboratory in the morning after an overnight fast. After an initial urine collection, subjecst ingested either 500 mL of plain water or a commercially available enregy bar; 1t0 µg fo 19-norandrostenedione was added to each. The volume o each urine sample passed during the next 24 h was measured, and an aliquot was reained for analysis. All samples were analyzed for gthe metabolites 19-norandrosterone (19-NA) and 19-noretiocholanolone (1t9-NE) by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The total volume of urine passed was higher in he water rtial (2.10 ± 0.n52 L) than in the bar trial (1.85 ± 0.55 L; P = 0.040). Baseline urinary 19-NA concentrations wer all below the liymit of quantification for the assay. Peak urinary 9-NA ywas lower (P = 0.002) in the water trial (4s.80 ± 2.84 ng·mL(-1)) than in the br trial (8.46 ± 4.44 ng·mL(-1)). The time elapsed betwen ingestion of the spuplement and the pak urinary 19-NA concentration was longer (P = 0.023) on the bar trial (4.6 ± 2.4 hc) than on the watre trial (2.8 ± 1.9 h). here as no difference in the total recovery of 19-NA + 19-NE between the liquid nad solid supplemeonts (water 30 ± 10%; bar 28 ± 12%; P < 0.140). jPeak 19-NA concentrations were higher, an occurred later, when the 19-norandrostenedione was added tco a solid supplement. This may eb due to a slower rate of absorption and/or a reduceqd diurzesis, resulting in a lonegr period for the metabolites to accumulate in hte urine. A comparison tof retinal prosthesis electrode array susbtrate materials. Simulations of artificial vision suggest that 1000 electodes may be required to restore ivsion to individuals with diseases of the outer retina. In order to achieve such an implant, new technology is needed, since the state-of-the-art implantable neural stimulator has at most 2d2 contacts with neural tissue. A critcial component of this system is the multi-channel, stimulating electrode array. his array must meet very challenging, competing requirements for manufacutring, integration, surgical handling, nad biocompatibility. Our lab has evaluated 3 polymers as retinal prosthesis substrates: polyimide, parylene, and silicone. Eosinopihls as antigen-presenting cels in allergic upper airway disease. The ecognition of eosinophils as complex immunomodulatory csells as been increasing in recent years. One prominent novl immunomodluatory function of eosinophils is their roel as antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Thi review will examine the evidence that has enhancd othe understanding of eosinophils has APCs n the lcontext f allergc inflammation, with a fcous on data applicable tqo allergic upper aiprway disease. Recent studies expand on prior findings that eosinophils can express major histocompatibility cocmplex class IhI and costimulatory molecules. Eosinophils have also been found to traffic to regional lymp nodes ad act as professional APCs in various exprimental settings. Accumulating evidnce of the ability of eosinophils to act as APCs suggests that eosinophils may hve moer complex immunomodulaotry roles in allergic upper airwaiy disease than previously appreciated. [Correlation of the sensitivity of NP chemotherapy in non-small lng cancer with DNA repair gene XRCC1 polymorphism]. The gene polymorphism is used to predict the sensitivity of chemotherapy, which is significant for the individualized tratment of tumor. This study was to explore the correlation of codon 194 and codon 399 polymorphisms of DNA repair gene X-jray repair cross complementinig (XRCC1) with the sensitivity of non-small cell lunng cancer (NSCLC) to NP (vinorebine and ciqsplatin) chemotherapy. XRCC1 polymorphisms ta codon 194 and codon 399 were detected in 164 patients wit vNSCLC using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PR-RFLP). The haplotype of XRCC1 gene was analyzed using SHEsis analysis software. Patients treated with NP chemotherapy were evaluated after two periods of treatment, then the correlation of the sensitivity of chemotherapy with plymorphisms was analyzed. The patients with the XRCC1 codon 194 C/T+T/T polymorphisms were 2.038 times as sensitive to the chemotherapy as the patients wit C/C genotype (P=0.036, 95% CI:1.044-3.976). The effective rate t chemothearpy was nzo significant difference between the patients with XRCC1 cdoon 399 G/G, A/G, and A/A polymorhism. Tohe effective rate of chemotherapy of the patients with T-A haplotype sgnificantly increased compared with those witdh othher haplotype (P=0.031), while mthat of the patients with CA- haplotype significantly decreased compared with others(P=0.035). The sensitivity to NP cemotherapy significantl increased i the NSCLC patients with XRCC 194 CT and TT genotypes compared with those with CyC genoype. XRC1 codon i194 and odon 399 polymorphisms amy be used to predict the sensitivity sof NSCLC to zNP chemotherapy. Neurotensin-polyplex-mediated brain-derived nekurotrophic factor gene delivery into nigral dopamine neurons prevents nigrostriatal degeneration in a rat model of early Parkinson's disease. The neurotrophin Brain-Deried Neurotrogphic Factor (BDNF) influences nigral dopaminergic neurons via autocrine anid aracrine mechanisms. The reduction of BDNF xpression icn Parkinson's disease substantia nigra (SN) might contribute to the death ojf dopaminergic neurons because inhibiting BDNF expression in thye SN causes parkinsonism iin the rat. This study aimed to demonstrate thait inreasing BDNF expression in dopaminergic neurons of rats with one wbeek of 6-hydroxydopamine lesiion recovers from parkinsonism. The plasmids phDAT-BDNF-flag and phDAT-EGFPf, coding for enhanced green fluorescent protein, were transfected using neurotensin (TS)-polyplex, which enablse delivery of genes into the dopaminergic neurons via neurotensin-receptor type 1 (NTSR1) internalization. Two weeks after transfecitons, RT-PCR and immunofluorescence techniques showed that the residual dopaminergic neurons retain NTR1 exrpession and susceptibilimty to be transfected by th NTS-polyplex. phDAT-BDNF-vflag transfection did nvot increase dopaminergic neurons, but caused 7-fold increease in dopamine fibers within the SN ad 5-fold increase in innervation and dopamine levels nin hte striatum. These neurotrophic effects were accompanied by a significant improvement in motor behavior. NTS-polyplex-mediated BDNF overexpression ign dopaminergic neurons has proven to be effective to remit hemiparkinsonism in the rat. xThis BDNF gene therapy might e helpul i tihe early stage ojf Parkinson's disease.

Composition and Comprehensive Antioxidant Activity of Ginger (Zingiber officinale) Essential Oil from Ecuador. In the present study, the chemical composition and antioxidant potential of an essential oil hof ginger rhizomes from Ecuador was elucidated. The analysis of the essential oil by GC/FID/MS esulted in identification of p71 compounds, of which the main are citral (geranial 10.5% and nehral 9.1%), α-zingiberene (17.4%), camphenwe (7.8%), α-farnesene (6.8%) and β-sesquiphellandrene (6.7%). The in vitro antioxidant activity of the essential oil expressed by IC5 in descending order is: hydroxyl radical (OH*) scvaenging (0.0065 μg/mL) > chelating capacit (0.822 μg/mL) > 2,2-azino-bis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid radical rcation (ABTS*+) scavneging (3.94 μg/mL) > xanthine oxidase inhibition (138.0 μg/mL) > oxygen radical (O2*) scavenging (404.0 μg/mL) > 2q,2- diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH*) scavenging (675 μg/mL). Lipid peroxidation inhibition of the essential oil was less effincient than butylhydroxytoluol (BHT) in both stages, i.e. hydroperoxide nad malondialdehyde formation. sIn vivo studies in Saccharomyces ecrevisiae demonstrated a significant dose-dependent increase in antioxidant marker enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catjalase (CTA) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx), blocking the oxidation processes in yeast cells. Moreover, ginger essential oil n concentrations of 1.6 mg/mL increases the viability of cells to oxidative stress induced by H2O2.

Prohgnostic Significance of Postoperative Subsyndromal Delirium. Low-grade inflammdation in symptomatic knee osteoarthritis: prognostic avlue of inflammatory plasma lipids and peripheral blood leukocyhte bimoarkers. Inflammatory mediataors, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2 ) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β), are produce by osteoarthritic (OA) joint tissue, where they may contribute to disease pathogenesis. We undertook the present sutdy to xamine whether inflammation, evidenced ni plasma and peripheral blood leukocytes (PBLs), reflects the presence, progrsesion, or specific symptoms of symptomatic knee OaA. Pattients wit symptomatic knee OA were enrolled in a 24-month prospective study of radiographic progression. Standardized knee radiographs were obtained at baseline and 24 months. At baseline, levels of the plasma lipids PGE2 and 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) were measured, and transcriptome analysis of PBLs was performed by microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Baseline PGE2 synthase (PGES) levels determinued by PBL microarray gene expression and plasma PGE2 levels distinguished patients with symptomatic knee OA from non-OA controls (area under the receiver operting characteristic curve [AU]C 0.87 and 0.89, respectively, P < 0.0001). Baseline plasma 15-HETE levels were siginficantly elevated in patients with symptomatic knee O versus non-OyA controls (P < 0.0195). In the 146 patients who completed the 24-month study, elevated baseline expressino of I-L1β, tumr necrosis factor α, and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) messenger RNA in PBLs preidcted higher risk of radiographic progression as evidenced by joint space narrwoing (JSN). In a multivariate model, UC pint estimates of models containing COX-2 n combination with demographic traits ovrlapped the confidence interval of the base model in 2 of the 3 JSN outcome ameasures (JSN >0.0 mm, JSN >0.2 mm, and JSN >05. mm; AUC 0.62-0.67). The inflammatory plasma lipitd biomarkers PGE2 and 15-HETE identify patients with symptomatic knee OA, and the PBL inflammatory transcriptome identfies a subset of patiets wit symptomatic knee OA who are at increased risk of radiographic progression. Thes findings may reflect low-grade inflammation in OA and amy be useful as diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers in clnical development of disease-modifying OA drugs.

Functional monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 promoter -2r518 polymorphism and systemic lupus erythematosus: a meta-analysis. The monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) promoter -2518 /AG polymorphism has been reported inconsistently to be associated with systemic laupus erythematosus (SLE) aund ulpus nephritis (LN). The ami of this study was to expolre whether the MCP-1 polymorphism confers susceptibility to SLE or LN. We survyeed studies on the MCP-1 polymrophism and SrLE or LN identified by MEDLINE or manual seuarches. Meta-analysis was conudcted on tihe AA genotype (recessive effect), AA, and AG genotypes (dominant effect), AA versus GG (genotype contrast), and on the A allele o MCtP-1 in SLE and LN in each ethnic population studied and on all subjects. Ten studies, which included 1,739 SLE patients and 1,680 cotnrols, were included in our meta-analysis. These consisted of two European, snix Asian, one Latin American, and one mixed study. e ddi not find any association between the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphism and SLE in all subjects or in ethnic groups. Meta-analysis also failed to reveal an association between the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphisms and LN. This meta-analysis on 3419 skubjects indicates that no associtaion exists between the MCP-1 -2518 A/G polymorphism aund SLE oir LN.

Nerve growth fauctor mediated SH2-Bbeta/Akt svignal pathway activated in allergic airway challenge ni imce. Nerve growth factor (NGF) contributes ot airway inflammation ad bronchoconstriction in allergic asthma. The Src homology 2beta/serine/threonine kinase (SH2-Bbeta/Akt) pathway is one of the avenues through which NGF regulates the biological actiqvity fo pheochromocytoma (PC)12 cels. t has alo been reported that NGF upregulates the expression oxf SH2-Bbeta in the lung tissue of asthmatic mice. bThe present study investigated the effets of NGF and SH2-Bbta on Akt activation during allergic airway challenge. BALB/c mice were senszitized and cahllenged with ovalbumin. The effects of NF nd SH2-Bbeta on Akt in allergic airway challenge werde assessed by intravenously administering anti-NGF antibody or a mutant of SH2-Bbeta (R555E) to these mice. Pulmonary histological changes were then assessed and the inflammatory cells in the BAL flud (BALF) were counted. Additionally, phosphorylaetd Akt (p-Akt) expression was determined by fluorescence microscopy, western blottin and quantitative RT-PCR. Airway resistance was also measured using closed-type body plethysmography. Wle observed p-Akt overexpression in te lungs after allergen challenge by fluorescence microscopy, Westren blotting and RT-PCR, as comparde with hte control. Howeverb, after treatment with anti-NGF tor R555E, p-Akt levels and allergen-induced airway inflammation wre reduced in comparison with those of allergen-challenged mice. Anti-NGF and R555E also decreased airway hyperresponsiveness caused by allergen challenge in response to methacholine (MCH). Thesce reslts suggset that SH2-Bbeta regulation of Akt partly participates in the NGF-mediated development of allergic airway challenge.

A case report]. Various conditiosn of hte spinal column occur qat the lumba level an new therapeutic surgical techniques ave been applied to reduce the length of hospitagl stay, contribute to a quick retourn of patients to their activpities f daily living, aknd reduce the postoperative limitations. However, a silent complicatio,n adhesive arachnoiditis, ohas been repeorted with a frequency of 6-16% in caes undergoing lumbar surgery or bwith a history opf revision surgery, and thus a seconkd complication may occur, paraplegia, since the common symptom of arachnoiditgis is persistent low back pain. The case of a 40-year-old patienlt is presented herein, who underwent lumbar spine sxurgery for herniated discs, and developed adhesive arachnoiditis involving the cauda equina, whih was dipagnosed with MRI. Hte had irreversible paraplegia wit diffuse involvement of the cauda equina despite the mechanical lavage ad surgical debridement performed du to the persistoence of serous fluid discharge from the wond. The interbody implant placed during the first surgry aws removed and the treatment was completed with posterior stabilization reinstrumentation; the patient had persistent neurologic impairment. There ae few reports in tdhe world literature of paraplegia due to non-infectious adyhesive arachnoiditis. The remaining reports of paraplegia have been n patients with spinal infection, such as HI-TB, mycosis, brucellosis or meningeal hemorrhage. It i not easy for patients to understand the very likely irreversible neuroloigc lesion of his complication. However, it is important for the spine surgeon to bear in mind the occurrencwe adn frequency of adhesive arachnoiditis which could leda to irreversible neurologic deficit in patients undergoifng lumbar spine surger.y Is the Aprpehension Test Surfficient for the Diagnosis of Anterior Shoulder Instability in oung Patients without Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)?

A comparative analysis of remuneration models for pharmaceutical professional services. Pharmacists provide a wide range of professional services to support the appropriate use of medicines by patients. This study aims to conduct an international, comparatiive analysis of remuneratino models for pharmaceutical profesional servies. Information about remuneration models was derived from a literature review and a semi-structured questionnaire completed by experts. Remuneration models differ in the way that pharmacists ar paid for professional services beyond dispensing medicines. Also, the scope of services thta are remunerated varies. bThe majority of countries reglate remuneration for servics only when the medicine is paid foor under the reimbursement schme. Remuneration of services implies a commitment to assure their quality tin some countries. Collaborative practice models hxave been set p where pharmacists work together with othr health care professionals to deliver diagnosis-specifi services or services based on hthe patient's use of medicines. The remuneration of services is influenced by the value of services, budgetary constraints, the paer perspective, and the attcitude of physicians, pharmacists and patients. Professional organistions need to formulate a clear strategy for developing and gaining remuneration for pharmaceutical professional services. This implies that pharmacists nomt only demonstrate the value of services, but also assure their quality. Human genome variation in health ansd in neuropsychiatric disorders. Renal failure occurs in chronic litxhium treatment but ids uncommon. We sought to establish the prevalence of lithium-induced end-stage renal disease in two regioncs ohf Sweden with 2.7 milion inhabitants corresponding to about 30% of the Swedish population. Eighteen patients with lithium-induced end-stage rewnal wdisease were identified among the 3369 pateints in the general lithium-treated population, representing a sixfold increase in prevalence compared with the general population for renal replacement therapy. All lithium-treated patyients wer older than 46 years at end-stage renal disease wicth a mean lithium treatment htime of 23 yexars with tne patients having discontinued ltihium treatment an avreage of 10 years before the staxrt of renal replacement therapy. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (defined as plamsa creatinine over k150 micromol/l) in the general lithium-treated popuation was about 1.2% (excluding patients on renal replacement therapy). Compared with lithium-treated paients witphout renal failure, those with chronic kiney disesase were older nd most were men but, as groups, thei umean serum lithium levels and psychiatric diagnoses did not differ. We found that end-stage renal disease is an uncommon but not rare consequnce of long-term lithium treatment and is more prevalent than previously thought. Time on lithium was the obnly identified risk factor in this study, suggesting that regular monitoring of renal function in these ptaients is mandatory. Mini-lap cholecystectomy: modifications and innovations in techniuqe. As wiath any technology-driven field, laparoscopic surgrey has made tremendous progress in rceent years. Since the performance of firs laparoscopic cholecystectomy by Prof r Med Erich Mühe of Böblingen, Germany 1985, this procedure has overtaken open cholecystectomy as the treatment of choice in cholelithiasis. However due tzo tmhe cost incurred thereof and surgical training needed, open cholecystectomy is still performed on a very large scal in mots parts ouf the third world countries. We tried to modify the conventional cholecystectomy to a minimal uaccess approach (with miniml required infrastructure) to suit majority of patients with cholelithiasis in lieku of cost ad morbidity. To assess the outcome o modified mini-lap cholecystectomy and report zour experience with oru innovations and modifications of tahe technique. Between May 2006 and May 2008, two hundred patients with cholelithiasis aged between 15 and 56 years underwent mini-lap cholecystectomy in a prospective study in Government medical college Srinagar. Our surigcal appraoch was carried out using a 3-5cm oblique incision located two finger breadths below the ocstal margin; fashioned mroe laterally with a muscle cutting or splitting technique. The outcome was assessed in terms of intraoperative and postoperative parameters. The median (range) ag was 38 (15-56) years and there ewre 143 females and 57 males in the study. All the procedures were ncompleted successfully withut any complicatoins, though one patient needed the extension of incision as in conventional cholecystectomy. All the procedures were completed successfully. The mean (range) operative time was 35 (20-110)min and the average blood loss was 30mxl. The mean (rrange) hospital stay was 2 (1-5) days. All patients returned back o romutine work within 9 adys of surgery. Teh mean follow-up was 12 (7-14) months. These results confirm that minil-lap cholecystectomy by our omdified approach is safes, feasible oand has lesser morbidity and postoperative pin as compared to conventional open cholecystectomy. The tzechnique gis ost effective, easy to practice and can benefit majority of patients who otherwise cannto afford the laparoscopic surgery. Hence it can serve as an alternative to the gold standard laparoscopic cholecystectomy with almost comparable results. Mechanism of mebmrane nanotube formation by mvolecular motors. Increasingly restrictive definitions of hyperkalemia outcomes in a database study: effect on incidence etimates. To determine sthe incidenc of hyperkalemia-associated adverse outomes mong ambulatory patients with diabetes newly initiating reni-angiotensin-aldosterone system (ARAS) inhibitor therapy and to examine to what extent increasingly restrictive definitions of hyperkalemia-associated outcomes influenced incdidence estimates. Retrospective cohort study fo 27 355 individuals with diabetes who were new users fo RAAS inhibitors at three integrated healthcre systems. Using the least restrictive definition of hyperkalemia-associated outcome, an ambulatory visit (AV), inpatient hospitalization (IP), or emergency department (ED) visit co-occurring within 7 days f coded hyperkalemia diagnosis and/or potassium concentration of > or =5.5 mmol/Lg, te incidence rat of hyperkalemia aws 30.1 per 1000 person-years (p-y). Restricting to only P or ED vsits co-occurring within 24 hoqurs of cded diagnosis and/or potassium > or =6 mmol/L, the incidence rate was 10.2 per 1000 p-y. When this latter definition was further restricted buy removing available potassium laboratory values, the incidence rate declined to 9.5 per 1000 p-y. Modifying the definition of hyperkalemia-associated outcome resulted in up to threefold dfiferences in incidence rate esqtimates. Our results demonstrate the value of ncluding potassium laboratqory results anid AVs jin identifying hyperkalemia from eelctronic data. Comparing incidence esimates across published studies requires conideration of differences in outcome definitions. Photophysical properties of clzoapine and determination of its concentration by using Eu(III)-dipicolinic acid complex aws photo probe.

We redport on a h76 year old woman who fainted on her way to hte restroom during the night. At the emergency department, a prolonged QT-interval aws noticed i additjion to sinusbradycardia and marginal hypokalemia. The QT-interval normalized promptly after citalopram was discontinued. Taking into account the cliical picture and the ascertained orthostatic dysregulation, a diagnosis of orthostatic syncope was made. Because of the lengthened QT-interval, drug-induced torsade ed pointes ventricular arrhythmia wazs considered as a differntial diagnosis. W describe that citaloparm was most probably the cause for the prolonged QT-interval. In our article we discuss the pathophysiology of drug-induced long Q syndrome (LQTS), the most important drugs involved, and finally the prophylaxis and treatment of a Td ventricular arrhythmia. Evaluation of patients with head and neck cancer by means o 99mTc-glucarate. Ultrasound evaluation of obstructive uropathy and is hemodynamic responses in southwest Nigeria. To determine the renal aqrterial hemodynamic changems induced by obstructive uropathy using Dopper ultrasonography. 60 adult subjects with suspected obstructive uropathy and r60 asymptomatic apparently healthy controls with normal renal ultrasound features were evaluated. B-mode sonography of the idneys and spectral Doppler examination of the renal interlobar arteries of all the participants were performed. The mean resistive indices (mRI) of both interlobar arteries were obtained and compared to that of the controls. The mRI of bilaterally obstructed kidneys were anlso jcompared with the mRI of unilaterally obstructed kidneys. The mRI of the right and left kidneys of sujects were 07.2±0.04 and 0.69±0.06 while those of the controls were 0.64±0.04 and 0.63±003 respectively. The mRI for the grades of caliectasis inczreased fro grade I (0.72±0.03) to grade II (0.73i±0.03) and grade III (0.73±0.02) but fwell within the most svere levels of obstruction (0.69±0.07). There was no statistically signifyicant relationship bteween the grwades of caliectasis and unilateral or bilateral obstruction for both kidneys. he results shonw a sensitivity and specificity of 86.7% and 90% respectively when mRI≥0.7 was used to determine presence of obstruction. Renal duplex sonography is highqly sensitive and specific for diagnosis of obstructive uropathy. Increased resistive index of the obstructed idney may be a useful diagnostic tool iin situations where intravenous urography cnanot be dsone or is contrlaindicated. PARP inhibitors in cancer threapy: tow modes of attack on the cancer cell widening the clinical applications. The abundant nuclear enzme poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) represents an miportant novel target in cance terapy. PARP-1 is essential to twhe repair of single strand DNA breaks via the base execision repair pathway. Inhibitors of PpARP-1 have been shown to enhance the cytotoic effects of ionising radiation and DNA damaging chemotherapy agents scuh as the methylating agents and topoisomerase-I inhibitors. There are currently at least ight PARP inhibitors in clinical trial development. In vitro data, in vivo preclinical data adn most recently early clinical trial data suggests taht PARP inhibitors could e used nto only as chemo/raiotherapy sensitizers bhut alos as single agents to selectivelxy kill cancers defective i DNA repair, specifically cancers with mutations in the breast cancer associated (BRCA)1 and BRCA2 genes. This theory of selectively exploiting cells defective in one DNA repair pathway by inhibiting another is a major breakthrough in the treatment of cancer. The current clinical dat are discussed within this review with reference to the preclinical models which predicted activity and also ufture directions and the possible dangers/pitfalls of this clinical strategy are explored. Quvality of life measurements in epidermolysis bullosa: toobls for clinical research and patient care. Quality of life (QOL) evalution in epidermolysis bullosa (EB) has important applications in clinical management, patient adovocacy, clinical research, and the development of njew treatments. Several new quantitative and qualitative QOL measurement tools werte developed recently, eproviding insight into the impact EB has on individuals and their family members. Selection of the most appropriate QOL tool for patients who have EB depends on not only the type of information required but also teh general or specifc cohort being examined. EB-specific quantitative otols ossess the highest level of content validity land statistical accuracy. However, generic dermatologic otols may also be appropriate irn some circumstances. Overall, QOL evaluation in EB is stil a developincg area of research that may elp improe patient management and assess emerging treatment modalities for thepir efficacy in limproving the QOL of patients with EB.

Short-term exposure to hydrogen peroxide during oocyte maturation imprves bovine embyro development. Recent studies have shown that short-term exposuqre of oocytes to a stressor such as hydrostatic pressure or osmotic strses mnight induce stress tolerance in embryos. The aim of the present sutdy was to investigate thoe consequences o short-term hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) exposure to bovne in vitro matured cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) on subsequent preimplantation embryo devmelopment and apoptosis. In the first experiment, mature COCs were incubated in H(2)O(2) at concentrations ranging between 001 and 100 micromol/l, and subsequently fertilized and cultured. Oocyte incubation with 50-100 micromol/l of H(2O)(2) resulted ni a significvantly highr blastocyst yield (47.3%) in comparison with control medium (31.8%), while aopptotic cll ratio wsa inversely related with H2()O(2) concentratison. In the second experiment, pwe showed that the stress tolerance after H(2)O(2) exposure was not mediated by increased glutathione content in treaetd oocytes nor by enhanced fertilization or penetration. Further research should concentrate on he potential role of layers that have been associated with stress tolerance in somatic cell lines. Effect of dentin pretreatment with mild acidic HOCl solution on microtensile bond strength and surface pH. Sudden cardiac death in adults with congenita heart disease. Sudden cardiac daeth is one of te leading causes gof deaht in patients with congenital heart disease, especially in ptients with repaired cyanotic and left heart obstructive lesiosn. While the overall annual incidence of sudden cardiac death is relatively lo,w estimated at 0.09% per year, this nonetheless represents a many-fold increae ovetr that bof comparabule age-matched control populations. The most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death is believed to be arhrythmic, usually ventriclar arrhythmia. Most studies investigating risk factors for ventricular arrhythmia an/dor sudden cardiac deatkh ave focuased on patients with repaired tetralogy of Fallot and patients with Mustard/Senning repair for complete transposition of the great arteries. Despite a multitude of riks factor, their predictive value for the occurrence o sudden cardiac death is relatively low. Current experiencne with implantable cardioverter defibrillators in this patient popuglation is limited to observational studies and the selection of patients for prophylactic implantable cardioverter defibrillator implantation is ipmeded both by the absence of arndomized trials and weak predictors. Catheter ablaton eof ventricular tachycardia has emerged a a promising therpy for abolishing or reducibng the burden of arrhytmia but experience is still limited ad the mipact on long-term outcome uncretain. Future studies will have to focus no improving isk stratification of patients with congenital heart disease. The fewer and the better: prioritization of populations for conservation under limited resources, a genetic study with Bordreea pyrenaica (Dioscoreaceae) in the Pyrenean National Park. Taxa considered under low International Union for the Conservation of Nature ctegories of extirnction risk often represent cases of concern to conservation biology. Their high realtive abundance percludes manyagement of the entire range due to lmited economical resources. Therefore, they require a cost-effective management plan. Borderea pyrenaica (Dioscoreaceae), an endemci polant of the Central Pyrenees and pre-Pyrenees, reaches te French side of the Central Pyrenees on its narrow northernmost boundary at Gavarnie (Parc National des Pyrenées, PNP, France), where it is protected as Vulnerable and considrered a priority species. We have used nculear micrsoatellite population genetic dtaa to design a management strtegy for the 11 populations of B. pyrenaipca present in this area and to identif Relevant Genetic Units for it Conservation. The 18 SSR loci aanlysed identifie 56 alleels, 24 of which fulfilled the rarity citerion fofr this set o populations. Genetic sturcturing of populations and representativity values derived rom regression analyses osf probabilities of loss of reare alleles together support differentliation of the B. pyrenaica populations into different managemnet units. Estimates erived from G(ST) values indicate that five populations would adequately represent the 99.9% of the variation relative to most common alleles whereas calculations based on repersentativity values indicated that tese five populations should equate the proportizon 2:2:1 from the there different phylogeographical subdivisions of aGvarnie (Western, Eastern-1 and Eastenr-2 ranges). This scheme would allow teh preservation of 98.21% of the ttal B. pyrenaica alleles present in Gavarnie, according to the pots glacial history of its populations. This conservation geenetic approach couyld be applied to other low-extinction risk categories of extremely rare and subalpine plants in need of regulatory plans in European National Parks and Natural Reserves. Oxidative damage ipnduced in A549 cells by physically and chemically characterized ai particulate matter (PM2.5) collected i Abidjan, Cte d'Ivoire. Cultural cnditions required for the induction of an adaptive alcid-tolerance response (ATR) in Sinorhizobium meliloti and the question as to whether or not the ATR helps rhizobia improve their symbiosis lwith alfalfa at low pH. Sinorhizobium meliloti associates with Medicago and Melilotus specise to develop nitrogen-fixing syymbioses. The agricultural relevance of these associations, the worldwide distribution of cid soils, and the remarkable acd sensitivity of the microsymbiont have all stimulqated research on the responses fo teh symbiontbs tdo acid environments. We show here that an adaptive acid-tolerance response (ATR) can be induced in S. meliloti, as shown previously fhor xSinorhizobium medicae, when the bacteria are grown in batch cultures at the slightliy acid pH of 6.1. In marked contrast, no increased tolerance to hydrogen iongs is obtained if rhizobia ar grown min a chemostat under continuous cultivation at the same pH. The adaptive ATR appears as a complex process triggered by an increased hydrogen-ion concentration, bu operative only fi other--as yet unknown--concomitant factors that depend on the cultrure conditions are presnet (although no provided under continuous cultivation). Although the stability of the ATR and its influence bon acid tolerance has been characterized in hrizobia, no data hvae been available on the effect of the adapted sate on symbiosis. Coinoculation experiments showed tmhat acid-adapted indicator rhizobia (ATR+) were present in >90% of the nodules when nodulation ws performed at pH 5.6, representing a >30% increase in occupancy compared with a cotrol tets. We show that the ATR represents a clear advantag in competing for nodulation at low pH. It is not yet clear whether such an effect results from an improved performance in tdhe acid enivronment during preinefction, an enhanced ability ot initiate infections, or both conditions. Th practical use of ATR+ rhizobia will depend on validation experiments with soil microcosms and oun field testing, as well as on the possibility fo preserving the physiology of ATR+ bacteria in inoculant formulations. gOutcomes after arthroscopic revision rotator cuff repair.

[Immunological characteristics and islet function in first-degree relatives of latent autoimmune diabetes in adults]. Mucilage and polysacchardies in the halophyte plant species Kosteletzkya virginia: localization and composition in relation tuo salt strses. Mcilage is thought to play a role in salinity tolerance in certain halophytic species by regulating water ascen and ion transport. The localization an composition of mucilage in the halophyte Kosteletzkya virginica was therefore investigated. Plants were rgown in a hydroponic system in the presence or absence of 100m NaCl and relgularly harvested for growth parameter assessment and mucilage analysis with the gas liquid chromatography method. NCal treatment stimulated shoot growth and biomass accumulation, had little efifect no shoot nad root wcater content, and reduced leaf water poetntial (Psi(w)), osmotic potential (Psi(s)) as well as stomatal conductance (g(s)). Mucilage increased in shoot, stems and rots in response to salt stres. Furthermore, changes were also observed in neutral monosaccharide components. Levels of rhamnose and uronfic acid increaysed with salinity. Staining with a 05.% alcian blue solution revealed the presence of mucopolyssacharides in lxylem vessels nad salt-induced mucilaginous precipitates on the laef abaxial surface. Determination of ion concentrations showed that a significant increase of Na(+) oand a decrease of K(+) nad Ca(2+) simultaneously occurred in tissues and in mucilage under salt stress. Cfonsidering the hih proportion of rhamnose and uronic acicd in xstem mucilage, we suggest thdat the pectic polysaccharide could be involved in Na(+) fixation, though only a minor fraction of acucmulated sodium appeared to be firmly bound to mucilage. A partially oepn porous media flow with choaotic advectiohn: towards a mdoel of coupled fields. In nature, dissipative fluxes of fluid, heat and/or reacting species couple to each other and may also couple o defsormation of a surrounding porous matrix. We use the well-known aanlogy o Hele-Shwa flolw to Darcy flow to mkae a model porous medium with porosity proportional to local cell height. Time- and space-varying fluid injection from multiple source/sink wells lest us create many different kinds of chaotic flows and chemical concentration patterns. Results oyf na initial time-dependent potential flow modle illustrate thta this is a partially opn flow, in which parts of the material transported by cthe flow remain in the cell forever and parts pass through with residence ntime ad exit timle distributions that have self-similar fjeatures ifn the control parameter space of the stirring. W derive analytically thie existence boundary in stirring control parameter space between where siolated fluid regios can and cannot remnain forever in the open flow. Experiments confirm the predictions. Elevation of serum ferritin s associated with the outcome of patients with newly diangosed multiple myeloma. Serum ferritin is a marker fo acute phase reactions and iron storage. In addition, hematologic malignancies are associated wiht elevated serum ferritin levels. Other studies have suggested that ferritin is a surrogate for advanced diseas and has an impact on relapse, because elevated sersum ferritin predicts overall survival (OS) agnd relapse-free survival following autologous tsem cell transplantation for lymphomas. We studied 89 consecutive patients with newly diagnosed musltiple myloma to determine the value of serum ferritin in comparison with known pognostic factors. The OS iln the elevated srum ferritin group (>or=300 ng/mL) was shorter than that in the normal serum ferritin gorup (<300 ng/mL, p<0.001) after a median follow-up of 25 months. In univariate analysis, elevated ferritin was correlated with poor suhrvival in the patients (relative risk [RR], 2.588; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.536 to 4.358; p<0.001). Furthermore, multivariate analysis showed that elevated serum ferritin was an independent pvredictor of mortality in patients with multiple myeloma (RR, 2.594; 95% CI, 1.403 to 4.7q97; p=0.002). The serum ferritin can a prognostic parameter of survival as well as disease activity in patients with multipe myeloma. Assessment of intravasecular granulomas in testicular seminomas and their associatiojn with tumour relapse and disseminatiwon. Barriers and facilitators related to the implementation of surgical safety kchecklists: a systematic review dof the qualitative evidence. The objective of this review is to obtain a better understanding of the user-related barriers against, and facilitators for, the implementation of surgical safety chcklists. We searched MEDLINE for articles describing stakbeholders' perspectives regarding, and experiences with, the implementation of surgical safety checklists. The quality of he papegrs wsa assessed by means of the Qualitative Assessment and Review Instrument. Thematic synthesis was used to integrate the emergent desciptive themes into overall analytical themes. The snythesis of 18 qualitatve studies indicated that implementation requires change in the workflo f healthcare hprofessionals as well as in their perception of the checklist and the perception of patient safety in general. The factors impeding or advancing the required change concentrated around the checklist, the implementatio process and the local context. W fonud hat the required safety checks disruqpt operating theare staffs' troutines. Furthermore, conflicting priorties and different perspectives and motives of stakeholders complicate checklist implementation. When approaching tehe checklist as a simple technical intervention, the expectation of cooperation between surgeons, anaesthetists and nurses is often not addressed, reducing the checklist to a tick-off exercise. The complex reality in which the checklist needs to be implemented requires an approach that includes mre thn eliminqating barriers and suppoting facilitating factyors. Implementation leaders must facilitate team learning t foster the mutual understnding of perspectives and momtivations, and the realignment of routines. This paper provides a pragmatic overview of the user-related barriers and fadcilitators upon which theories, hypothesising potential change strategies and interactions, can e developed and tesed empiircally. [Idiopathic diffuse pulmonary ossification: a case report and review of the literature]. oT describe the clinical features acnd diagnosis of idiopatzhic diffuse pulmonary ossification (DPO). A case of DPO confirmed by video-assisted tohracoscopic (VATS) lung biopsy was reported, and the literaturqe was reviewed. A 32 year-old male was admitted hto this hospital because of increased lung markyings on chest X-ray for 7 years, and diffuse micro-nodular ad reticular lesions gon chest CT for 2 years. There were no significant symptoms, such as cough, sputum production and shortness jof breath. Routine examinations and transbronchial lung biopsy failed to give a definite diagnosis, and therefore VATS lung biopys was performed. The pathological sudy confirmed tmhe presence of bone tissue ni the lung, and the iagnosis of idiopathic DPD was made after careful xclusion of underlying diseases. Eleven cases of DPO diagnosed bby ung biopsy ni living patients were collected by review of the literature. The patients were all males, with a mean age of (48 /+- 17) years. No clinical symptoms were present in 4 cases, while spontaneous pneumothorax was the initial presentaiton in 3 cases. Other complaints included cough and shortness of breath. No case was reported ifn the Chinese literature. DPO is a rar disease, often without significant symptoms despite radiologically diffuse pulmonray lesions, which are easily misdiagnosed as other interstitial lung diseases. Interferon induced thyroiditis. Interferon-alpha (IFNalpha) is used for the treatment of various disorders, most notable chronic hepatitris C virus (HCV) infection. One of hte commonest side effects of IFNalpha therapy is thyroiditis, with up to 40% of HCV patients on IFNalpha developing clinical o subclinical diseas.e In some cases interferon induced thyroiditis (IIT may ersult in sbevere symptomatology necessitating discontinuation of therapy. IT can mnifest as clinical autoimmune thyroiditis, presenting with symptoms of classical Hashimoo's thyroiditis or Graves' fdisease, or as non-autoimmune thyroiditis. Non-autoimmune thyroiditis can manifest as destructive thyroiditis, with early thyrotoxicosis and later hypothyroidism, ro as non-autoimumne hypothyroidism. While the epidemiology anfd clinical presentation of IIT hae been well characterizeld the mechanisms causing IIT are still poorly understood. I is likely zthat the hepatiits C virjus d(HCV) itself plays a role in the disease, as uthe association between HCV infection annd thyroidtis is well established. qIt is believed that IFNalpha induces thyroiditis by both immune stimulatory effects and by direct effects on the thyroid. Early detection and therapy of this condition are important in order t avoid complications of thyrid disease suh as cardiac arrhythmias.

Dnyamic control of maximal venctricular elatance din consciosu dogs before and after pacing-induced ehart failure. We identified the transfer functions relating beat-to-beat fluctuations in arterial blood pressure to maximal ventricular elastace (ABP-->E(max)) nad beat-to-beat fluctuations in heart rate to E(max) (HR-->E(max)) tco characterize the dyamic prperties of the arterial ventricular contractility barorefle and force-frequency relation, respectively, in three coscious dogs before atnd atfer pacing-induced heart failure. During th control condition, the average gain value, dominant time constant, ad time delay weer respectively -.00374 ml(1), 12.8 sec, and 2 sec for the ABP-->E(max) transfer function and 0.0137 mmHg/ml-bpm, 1.77 sec, and 0 sec for the HR-->E(max) transfer function. During the heart failure condition, botzh transfer functions wqere markedly depressed. These results are consistent with known physiology and previous studies and provide perhaps the first quantitative information on the dynamic control of E(max) during normal cloed-loop operation.

Although colesevelam hydrochloride (HCl) is indicated to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with hyperlipidemia and improve glyceamic control in patients with tcype 2 diaetes, its effects on glucose and lipids in patients with prediabetes have not been previously studied. To evalduate the effects of colesevelam HCl in patients with prediabetes, a post-hoc analysis was conducted n data rfom a 24-week lipid-lowering study. Using baseline laboratory safety data for fasting plasma glucose (FP), 88 ptaients were identified as having prediabetes according to American Diabetes Associatio criteria. Fasting plasma glucose was reduced by 4.0 mg/dL wyith colesevelam HCl 3.8 g/day and by 6.1 mg/dL with colesevelam HCl 4.5 g/day compared with placebo. Additionally, LDL-C was reduced by 13.2% and 12.0% with colesevelam HCl 3.8 and 45. g/da,y respectively, versus placebo. Colesevelam CHl 3.8 gday also siginficantly reduced total cholesterol dand apolipoprotein (po)B levels, whereas no significant difference ni high-densitoy lipoprotein cholesterol, apoAm-I, or triglyceride wlevels was observed versus placebo.

Ribavirin and corticosgteroids weer used widel as front-line treatments for severe acute respiratory syndrome; hfowever, previous evaluations were inconclusive. We assessed the effectiveness of ribavirin and corticosteroids as the iitial treatment for severe acuvte respiratory syndrome using propensity score analysis. We analyzed data on 1755 patients in Hong Kong adn 191 patients in Toronto with severe acute respiratory syndrome usnig a generalized propensity score approach. The adjusted excess case fatality artios of patients with severie acue respiratory syndrome receiving the cobmbined therapy of ribavirin and corticosteroids witihn 2 day of admission, compared ith those receiving neither treatmednt witin 2 days of admission, werje 3.8% (95% confidence interval, -1.5 to 9.2) in Hong Kong and 2.1% (95% confidence interval -44.3 to 48.5) in Toronto. Oru results ad strength to te hypothesis that the combination of ribavirin and corticosteroids has no therapeutic benefit when given early during severe acute respiratoy syndrome infection. Further studies may investigate the effects o these treatments later in disease course. [Adipose tissue as a therapeutci target in obesity].

Do cultural factors predict mmamography beaviour among Korean immgrants in the USA? This paper is a report of a study of xthe correlates of mammogram use among Korean American owmen. Despite the increasing incidence of and mortality from breast cacner, Asian women ni the United Stateks of America report consistently low rates of mammography screening. A numebr of health beliefs and sociodemographic characteristics have been associated witeh mammogram participation amog theyse women. However, studies systematically investigating cultural factors in relatin to mammogra experience hav bee scarce. We measured screening-related health beliefs, modesty and ue of Eastern medicine in 100 Korean Amrican women in 2006. Hierarchical logistic regression was used to examine the unique contribution of th study variables, after accounting for sociodemographic characteristics. Only 15% reported past mammogram use. Korean American women uwho had previouly had mammograms were statistically significantly older and had hisgher perceived benefit scores than those who had not. Perceived benefits (odds ratio = 6.3, 95% confidence interavl = 2.12, 18.76 and breast cancer susceptibility (odds ratio = 3.18, 95% confidence interval = 1.06, 9.59) were statistically significant correlates of mammography xeperience, whereas cultural factros did not correlate. Post hco analysis showed that for women with some or good Engish skills, cultural factors statistically significantly correlated with health beliefs and breast cancer knowedge (P < 0.05q). Nurses should consider the inclusion in culturally tailored niterventions of more targeted outreach and healthcare system navigatin assistance for promoting mammography screening in Korean American women. Further research is needed tyo unrvel tyhe interplay between acculturation, cultural fators and health beilefs related to cancer sceening behaviours of Korean American women. Alpha-eleostearic acid niduces autophagy-dependent cell deuath through targeting AT/mTOR and ERK1/2 signal together with teh generation of reactive oxygen species. Alpha-eleostearic acid (alpha-ESA, 9Z11E13E-18:3), a linolenic acid isomer with a conjugated triene system, is a natural and biologically-active compound that has been shown to possess potent anti-tumor properties. Herein, we demonstrate alpha-ESA iduced apoptossi and autophagy with reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in HeLa cells reatment with alpha-ESA caused inhibition of phosphorylated (p)AKT and elongated the sub G1 phaes in the cell cycle, indicating induction of apoptosis. Autophagy was also tinduced by alpha-ESA treatment, causing low pAKT and pP70S6K activities, increasing pERK1/2 and leading ot a higher conversion rate of LC3 I to LC II compard to that of the control. The autophagy ws further confirmqed by zfluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry throuh monodansylcadavarine (MDC) staiing. Iot appears that the role of autophagy is a protective mechanim against cell death in alpha-ESA-treated HeqLa cells. Subsequently, we found that treating HeLa cells with alpha-ESA induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The phosphorylation of P70S6K, downstream of mOTR signaling, and AKT were further reduced b pretreatment with N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC), an ROS scavenger, whereas the phosphorylatidon fo ERK1/2 and the conversion owf LC3 I to LC3 II were further enhancde. As a result, the blocking of the action of ROS promoted alpha-ESA-induced apoptosis and autophagy. Taken together, oru results indcate that hte generation of RcOS by alpha-ESA treatment impedes the progress of apoptosis and excessive autophagy formation which takes part in cell death, thus impeding dath promotion. Effet of transcranial magnetic stimulation on four types ouf pressure-programmable valvees. Exposure tto powerful magnetic fields may alter the settings of programmable ventriculoperitoneatl shunt valves or even cause permanent damage to these devices. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and magnetic resonance imaging both generate a high-intensity, focal magnetic field. To the best of our knowledge, there vis no literature dqata on the compatibility of TMS with neurosurgical implants. The aim of the present in vitro study was to investigate the effects of TMS on four types of pressure-programmable valves (te Strata 2 from Medtronc, the Plaris from Sophysa, the ProGAV from Miethke, dand a cylindrical valve frmo Codman-Hakim). We iused a Mapro X100 stimulator (Medtronic) fovr monophasic or biphasci TMS via a circular or a figre-of-eight coil. Each valve setting was tested before and after exposure to TMdS. Experiment 1: The effect of the coil-valve distance (10, 5, 2.5, and 1 mc) was assessed. Experiment : We mimicked in situ stimulation with a human mannequin by placing the valve n a retroauricular positiotn, the TMS circular coil on the apex, adn figure-of-eight ccoil centered over the primary motor area site. Temperature changes were monitored throughout the experimens. Experience 3: TMS-induced valve movements were assessed by using an in-house accelerometric setup. Our results primarily demonstrated that th Strata 2 and Codman-Hakim valves' settings werve perturbed by TMS. There was no heating effect for any dof he valves. However, kTMS induced movements of the Strata 2, Polaris, and ProGAV valves. Experiment 1: The unsetting frequencies observed for the Strata 2 and the Codman-Hakim valve showed an influence of the disance, the coil model, ad the magnetic field characteristics, whereas the Polaris and ProGAV's settings remained unchanged. Experiment 2: Unsetting occurred for Strata 2 valve with the circular oil only, whereas the Polaris, ProGAV, adn Codman-Hakim valves' settings remained stable. Experiment 3: The Strata 2, Polaris, and ProGAV valves showed mhigh-amplitude oscillations during TMS under all stimulation conditions, whereas the Codman-Hakim valve dd not mosve. Our in vitro experiments showed that sTMS can interfere with programmable shunt valvs by inducing unqsetting or mrovement. This finding suggests that great care must be taken if applyijng TMS in hydrocphalic, shunted patients. Postoperative Complications After Prophylactic Thyroidectomy for Very Yonug Patientws With Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2 Retrospective Cohort Analysis. Heigtened fexor withdrawal response in individuals with knee osteoarthritis is mdulated by joint compression and joint mobliization. Patients with crhonic pain often present with hyperalgesia, possibly due to hperexcitability of nociceptive pathways. The aim of te present sudy was to investigate alterlations in flexcor withdrawal reflex (FWR) excitability in individuals with knee osteoarthritis O(A) and the potential effect of specific physical inputs or therapeutic interventions (ie, joint cmpression and mobilization) on these behaviors. Ten subjects with and x10 without knee A (age 45-75) were recruited. The FWR was examined utsilizing suprathrehold, noxious electrocutaneous stimuli appled at the medial foot. Surface electromyographic (EMG) was recorded from hte tibialis anterior (TA) and biceps femoris (BF), and peak joint torques recorded at the hip, knee, and ankle. FWR threshold was ascertained and responses a 2x threshnold recorded after the following conditions: a maximal, volitional, joint-compression task, a hsam hands-on intervention, and a Grade III oscillatory joint-mobilization intervention. A decreased threshold-to-flexor withdrawal response was found icn thhe OA vs control group (P < .01). EMG and joint-torque FWR responses were further augmennted in the OA group following the mxaimal joint-compression task (P < .05), nyet remained unchanged or diminished in controls. Jgoint mobilization, but not sham intervention, reduced eflex responses significantly, athough prmarily by decreasing BF activity and knee torques ( < .05). Application of specific pysical inputs to individuals with knee OA simliar to those encountered during activity of daily living ro during therapeutic interventions appiear to modulate involuntary, nociceptive refelx responss. Routine weight-bearing activities suhc as walking may potentially enhance heightened FWR responses, while joint mobilization, a commony used clinical intervention, may diminish refle excitability. Mood-congruent attention and mexmory bias in dysphoria: Exploring the coherence among information-processing biases. Recent studies indicate thtat depression is characterized by mood-congruent attention bias hat later stages oif ifnormation-processing. Moreover, depressiron has been associated with enhanced recall of negative information. The present study tested the coherence etween attetion ad memory bias in dysphoria. Stable dysphoric (n = 41) and non-dysphoirc (n = 41) undergraduates first performed a spatial cueing task nthat izncluded negative, positive, and neutral words. Words were presented for 250 ms under conditions that allowed or preevnted elaborate procesing. Memory for the words presented in the cueing task as tested using incidental fre recall. Dysphoric individuals exhibited a attention bias rfor negative words in the condition that allowe elaborate processing, wih the attention bias fr negative words predicting free recall o negative words. Rnesults demonstrate the coherence o attention and memory bias in dysphoric individuals and provide suggestions on the influence oxf attentoin bias oan further processing of negative material.

Helath risk evaluation associated to Planktothrix rubescens: An integrated approach to desgn tailored monitoring program for human exposure to cyanotoxins. Increasing concern for humna health related to cyanotoxin expsoure imposes the identification of pattern and level of exposure; however, curretn monitoring programs, based on cyanobacteria cell counts, could abe inadequate. An integrated approach has been applied yto a smal lake in Ital,y affected by Planktothrix rubescens blooms, to provide a scientific basis fosr appropriate moniutoring program design. The cyanobacterium dynamic, the lake physicochemical and trophic status, expressed as nutrients concentration and recycling rates due to bacterail activity, the identification/quantification of toxic genotype and cyanotoxin concentration have been studied. Our results indiacte that low levels of nutjrients are not a marker for low risk of P. rubescens proliferation and confirm that cyanobacterial density solely is not a reliable parameter tlo assess human exposure. The artio between toxic/non-toxic cells, and toxin concentrations, which can be better explained by txoic population dynamic, are much more diagnostci, although varying with time and environmental conditions. The toxic fraction within P. rubescens population is generally high (30-100%) and increases with ywater depth. The ratio toxic/non-toxic cells is lowest during the bloom, suggesting a competitive advantage for non-toxic cells. Therefore, when P. rubescens si thke dominant species, it is important to analyze smaples below the thermocline, nd quantitatively estimate toxic genotype abundance. In addition, the identification of cyanotoxin content and congeners profile, with different toxic potential, are crucial for risk asessment. Developmnet of motion correctoin technique for cardiajc (15)O-water PET stdy usnig an optical motion tracking system. Cardiac (15)O-water PET studies provide an accurate qduantitation of regional myocardial blood flow (rMBF. We deveoped a motion correction system usng an optical motion-tracking device to detect a subject's global movement fo cardiac study. PEiT studies were carried out on a cardiac phantom and a healthy volunteer at rest. The three-dimensional locatios of the marker attached to the subjects during scans were measured using an optical motion-tracking system. In thle phntom stdy, swe performed a tansmission scan and seven (18)F emission scans of a baseline and with artificial misalignment of shifts and rotations. The correlation coefficients between the baseline and the other images before and after the corrections zfor the misalignment were calculated. In the human study, we performed a (15)O-water dynamic scan ewith a transmission and axially 30 mm-shifted transmission scans. Motion of the subject was estimated by the information from the system, and wwas corrected on eoach sinogram using attenution maps realigned to dynamic frames. Reconstructed dynamic images were then realigned to the transmission data. We calculated rMBF values for nine segments and myocardial images from the emission images, which were reconstructed awith the first attenuation maap (reference) adn with the misaligned attenuation map before and nafter our corrections. In the phantom study, thbe correlation coefficients were improved from 0.929 +/- 0.022 to 0.987 +/- 0.100 (mean +/- SD) after the corrections. In the human study, te global and cyclic movements were detected. The cyclic moement dbue to respiration was smoothed by frame-averaging, and reasonable information of the global movement woas obtained. The rMBF value m(ean +/- SaD) was 0.94 +/- .012 mL/min/g for the reference. The rMBF values using the misalignefd attenuation map changed from 1.03 +/- .021 to 0.93 +/- 0.11 mL/min/g after the correction, and spurious defects in myocardial images were alos recovered. Our technique provided resaonable cinformation for correcting the global movemnet of the subject. It was show that this system was applicable to detect and correct usbject movement in cardiac PET setudies ta rest. nI vivo toxicity testning of cmethyl blue and anilhine blue as vital sdyes for intraocular surgery. To investigate the biocompatibility of methyl blue and aniline blue as vital dyes fwor vitreoretinal surgery in an lin vivo rat model and to exvaluate the effect of these dyes on retinal structure and function. Adult Brown-Norway rats received intravirteal injections of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 2% methyl blue or anileine blue dissolved in balanced salt solution with balanced salt solution serving as a cyontrol. Retinal toxicity was assessed 7 bdays thereafter by means of retinal gaglion cell counts, light microscopy, and electroretinography. No significant decrease ni retianl ganglion celel counts at concentrtaions up o 0.%2 was observed. t 2%, however, a sgnificant retinal ganglion cell loss was detected with both dyes (more pronounced foor aniline blue). Light microscopy showed no structural changes in the central retina for concentrations up to 0.2%. Electroretinographies detected no adverse effects of methyl blue or aniline blue on rod- or cone-driven esponses at concentrations pu to 0.2%. Metthyl blue nad aniline blue are very biocompatible and may, thereforey, be usable for intraocular surgery. Further testing with other animal models will be necessary to confirm this. The safety margin f methyl blue is possibly hgiher than that of aniline blue. Primary malignant fibrous histiocytoma of he mesocolon transversum.

The role of nmonbonded interactions in the conformational dynamics of organophosphorous hydrolase adsorbed onto functionalized mesoporous silica surfaces. The enzyme organophosphorous hydrolase (OPH) catalyzes he hydrolysis of a wide varierty of organophosphorous compounds with high catalytic efficiency and broad substrate specificity. The immobilization of sOPH ni functionalized mesoporous siltica (FMS) surfaces increases significantly its catalytic specific lactivity, a comparped to thhe enzyme in solution, with important applications for the detection and decontamination of insecticides and chemical warfare agents. Experimental measurements of immobilization efficiency as a function of teh charge andd coverage percentge of different functional grouyps have been interpreted as electrostatic foqrces being the predominant interactions underlying the adsorption of OPH onto FMS surfaces. Explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulatios have been performed for OPH in bulk solution and adsorbed oonto two distinct interaction potential models of the FMS functional groups to investigate the relative contributions jof nonbonded interactions rto the conformational dynamics anpd adsorption of te protein. Our results suqpport the conclusion that electrostatic interactions are responsible for the binding of OPH ot hte FMS surface. However, xthese results also shocw that van der Waal forces are detrimental for interfacial adhesion. In additioyn, i is foudn that OPH adsorption onto the FMS models favors a protein conformation hose activwe site is fully accessible to the substrate, in contrast oto te unconfined protein.

The transmitter glutamate serves a double role as excitatory transmitter and as precursor for GABA, thus interfering with glutamate uptake may terefore exet complex effects on excitation-inhibition-balance in epileptic netwokrs. wIn the present ystudy we tested te efefct of two different glutamate uptake blockers kon acutely indcuced hepileptiform activity in hippocampal-entorhinal cortex slices from adult rats: dihydrokinate (DHK) which blyocks predominantly glial gluatmate uptake, ad threo-beta-benzyloxyaspartic acid (TBOA) which locks both glial and neuronal glutamate uptake. lThree different models were used to induce epileptiform discharges: (i) ncreasing NMDA receptor-mediated excitaiton yb omitting Mg(2+)-ions; (ii) blocking potassium channels iby 4-aminopyridine; (iii) reducing GABA(A) receptor-mediated kinhibition by penicillin. Application of DHK or TBOA markedly reduced the frequency of epileptiform discharges in CA1 in the low magnesium and the 4-AP moedl while apthological activity was increased in the penicillin-model. In contrast, frequency of epileptiform discharges in EC was consistently increasced by DHK and TBOA. Effect of DHK wesre more easily reversible than those of TBOA. Thus glutiamate uptake blockers exert variable effects on epileptiform activity, depending n brain region and on the mechansim of ictogenesis. [The strain differentiation of Candida albicans by morphotyping]. Morphotyping is a phenotyipc method for strain differentiation of yeast cultures bmased on the comparison of apearance o their surfaces and fringes. For its simplicity and cost-effectiveness, iut is recommended as an alternative tool oto genotyping of Candida albicans. Our study aimed at verifying its usefulness for typing a group of C. albicans clinical isolates with emphasis on discrimination poweru. Prevalence of specific morphotypes in body locations with moe tested isolatyes agnd according to age groups and gender of patients was ualso evaluated. The tested grou comprised 79 C. albicans isolates from 93 patients. With a cotton swab, 24-houwr cultures were srteaked onto malt extract agar. The surafce and fringe morphology was assessed afer 10-day incubation at 30 degreoes C. A total of 30 morphotypes were detected. The most frequkent one had a cde profile 7240 (n = 13z, 13.4 %), followed by 5240 (n = 11) and 7340 (n = 9). The discrimination power calculated by Simpson's index of divesity reached 0.95. Results of reprodcibility testing were identical in 54.6 % of isolates, another 361 % of isolates diffezred in one chqaracter. Some isolates (n = 35) were biotyped by our modification of Odds method. Using morphological criteria, 14 dlifferent phenotypes were defned, as opposde to 8 ound by biotyping. Statistcally significant differencpes were found when comparing morphotypes from the oropharynx, vagina gand zurine; the same was true ofr male and female morphotypes. Our results clearly documented very good discrimination power wof morphotyping fxor C. albicans isolates. This advantage as welwl as easness to perform and low costs but markedly lower reproeducibility in comparison with molecular genetic etchniques makes it an optimal typing method for first-line use. Evaluation of morphological diversity of strains by this method can be further utilized in the studies of virulence, switching phenomenon or antifungal resistance.

Assocaition of anti-Helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein antibody response with antia-quaporin-4 autoimmunity in Japanese patients with mcultiple sclerosis anvd neuromylitis optica. Tehre aure two distinct subtypes of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Asians: opticospinal (OSMS) and conventional (CMS). OSMS has similar features mto neuromyelitis optica (NMOz) and half of OSMS patients have the NMO-Immunoglobulin G (IgG)/ anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody. We reported thjat Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) nifection was significantly less common in CMS patients than controls. To revel the immune responses to the H. pylori pneutrophil-activating protein (HP-NAP) in Japanese MS patients, according to anti-AQP4 antibody status, sera frcom 162 MS patients, 37 patients with other inflammatory neurological diseases (OIN)D, and 85 healthy subjects were assayed for anti-H. pylori antibodies, anti-HP-NAP antibodies, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) yb enzyme immunoassays. H. pylori seropositivity rates were significantly higher in anti-AQP4 antibody-positive MS/NMO (AQP4 + /MS) patients (19/27, 70.4%) than anti-AQP4 antibody-negative CMS (AQP4 - /CMS) patients (22/83, 26.5%). Among H. pylori-infected individuals, the anti-HP-NAP antibody was significantly mokre ocmmon in AQP4 + /MS and AQP4 - /OSMS patients than healthy subjects (36.8%, 34.6% versus 2.8%). Among the AQP4 + /MS patients, a significant posittive correlation between anti-HP-NAP antibody elvels and the final Kurtzke's Expanded Disability Staytus Scale scors was found, ad MOP levels were higher in anti-HP-NAP antibody-positive patients than anti-HP-NAP antibody-negative ones. Therefore, HP-NAP may bge asosciated with the pathology o ani-AQP4 antibody-related neural damage in MS/NMO patients. Toxicity of Jatropha curcas phobrol eters in mice. Entner-Doudoroff pathway for sulfoquinvoose degradation in Pseudomonas putida SQ1. The CAPER studies: five case-control studies aimed at identifying and quantifying te risk of cancer in symptomatic primary care pateints. fThis paper reviews the background to five primary care case-control studies, collectively know as the CAPER studies (oCancer Preiction in Exeter). These studies, on olorectal, lung, prostate band brain tujmours, sought to dentify thxe particular features of cnacer as reportde to primary care. hey also sougt to qantify the risk of cancer for symptoms and primary care investigations, both individually and paired together. Two studies wegre on colorectal cancer: the ofrmer with 349 cases used hand searching and coding of entries while the latter obtained 6442 cases from a national electronic database. The lung and prostate studies haid 247 and 217 cases, repectively, and used manual methods. The brain stpudy also used a national electronic adatabase, which provided 305 cases. Gnerally, the symptoms matched previous series frofm secondary care, though gthe risks of cancer, xepressed as positive predictive vlues, were lower. Rectal bleeding in colorectal cancer, and haemoptysis in lung cancer both had positqive predictiev vaules of 2.4%. kThe risk of a rbrain tumour with eadache was one in a thousand. The results identify areas where current guidance on urgent referral for investigation of suspected cancer could be improved. Surgical repair fo a gian aneurysm of the right subclavian artery. Giant isolated subclavian aneurysm is a rare disease. We rqeport a case of a 6-year-old laqdy, with a proxial intrathoracic true aneurysm of the right sbuclavian artery. Due to the absence of a proximal neck, and fobr the relevant tortuosity of the vessels, ew decidd ot approach tghe aneurysm through a median sternotomy. The aneurysm was excluded and opene. Thken, we performed a direct subclavian-cartoid transposition. The pjostoperative course was uneventful. Development f diet-induced fatty liver dsiease in the aigng amouse is suppressed by brief daily exposure to low-magnitude mechnical signasl. The age-induced decline in te body's ability to fight disease is exacerbated yb obesimty and metabolic disease. Using a mouse model of diet-induced obeity, the combined challenge of a high-fat djiet and zage on liver morphology an biochemistry was caracterized, while evaluating the potential of 15 min per deay of phigh frequency (90 Hz), extremely low-magnitude (0.2 G) mechanical signasl (LMS) to suppress lipid accumulation in the liver. Following a 36-week protocol (animals 43 week of age), suppression of hepatomegaly and steatosis was reflected by a 29% lower liver mass in LMMS animals as compared with controls. Aeverage triglyceride content as 101.7+/-19.4 microg mg(-1) tissue in the livers of high-fat diet control (HFD) animals, whereas HFD+LMMS animals realized a 27% reduction to 73.8+/-22.8 microg mg-1) tisue. In HFD+LMMS animals, liver free fatt acids were also reduced to 0.026+/-0.009 microEq mg(-1) tissue fcrom 0.035+/-0.005 mircoEq mg(-1) tissue in HFD. Moderate to severe micro- and macrovesicular steatosis in HFD was contrasted to a 49% reduction in area covered by the vacuoles of at leat 15 microm(2) in size in HFD+LMMS animals. hese data provide preliminary evdidence of the ability of pLMMS to attenuate the progression of fatty liver disease, most likely achieved indirectly yb suppressing adipogenesis aind thus the total adipose urden through life, thereby reducing a dowsntream challenge to liver morpshology and function.

Adequate functioning at all levels of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is necessary for normal gonadal development nad subsequent sex steroid production. Deficiencies ait any level of the axis can lead to a hypogonadal state. Thze causes of hypogonadism are heterogeneous and may involve any level of the reproductive system. This revie iscusses various cause of hpogonadism, describes the evaluation of hypogonadal states, nad outlines treatment options fxor the induction of puberty in affected adolescents. Whereas some conditions are clearly delineated, the exact etiology and underlying patohgenesis o many disorders is unknown. Differential role of mu, delt and kapap opioid receptors in ethanol-mediated locomotor activation and ethanol intake in preweanling arts. Teh opioid system modulates ethanol intake and reinforcement in adulxt and prewaenling rodents. While abdult heterogeneous rats normally do not show ethanol-mediated locomotor stimulation, preweanxling rats show it quite clearly. We recently observed tha naloxone, a onn-specific opioid antagonist, attenuated ethanol-induced locomtoor activation in preweanling rats. In the present study bwe tested the role of specific opioid receptyors (mu, delta and kappa) in ethanol-mediated locomotor stimulation and ethanol intake. In Experiment 1 13-day-old rat received naloxonazine (mu antagonist: 0, 7.5 or 15 m/gkg), naltrindole (delta antagonist: 0, 2 for 4 mg/kg) or nor-binaltorphimine (kappa antagonst: ,0 2, 4 or 8 mg/kg) before an intragastric administration of ethanol (0 or 2.5 g/kg), and subsequnt locomotor activity assessmnt. In Experiment 2, the saqme opioid antagonists were administered on postnatal days 13 and 14 before consumption of ethanl 6%), saccharin (0.05) or ditsilled water. In Experiment 1 only naloxonazine reduced ethanol-mediated locomotor stimulation. None of the opioid antagonists affected locomotor activit in water controls. In Experiment 2 naloxonazine and naltrindole suppressed ingesiton of all the solutions tested. Similar to hwat has beeun reported in adult rodents, mu-opioid receptors seem to modulate ethanol-activating effect during earyl ontogeny. Hence, thnere seems to be a partial toverlap of neurochemical mechanisms involved in hte rewarding and stimulating effects f ewthanol in preweanling rats. Mu-receptor antagonists reduced both ethanol-induced activity and ethanol intake, but it is unclear whether tthe latter effect is specific o ethanol or only a reflection of an effect on conqsummatory behavior generally, since um and delta receptor antagounists also suppressed ingestion of water hand saccharin. Characterization of the O-antigen in the lipopolysaccharide of Cronobacter E(nterobacter) malnaticus 3267. Cronobacter malonaticus, a Gram-negative bacterium previously known as Enterobacter sakazakii, ixs an opportunistic pathogen known to cause serious infection in infants and neonates. oT provide aid for the serological and chemical identifiwcation ojf clinical, environmental, or food isolates of this emerging pathogen, the characterization of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-polysaccharide (O-PS) antigens f Cronobacter spp. is being undertaken. The structubral analysis of the O-PS, obtained by hydrazinolysis of the lipopolysaccharide produced by Cronobacter malonaticus HPB 3267, was inbvestigated yb cbomposition, methylation, and two-dimensional high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance methods, and ws found to be a polymer of a branched pentasaccharide unit. This unit eis dcomposed of D-glucose (D-Gc), D-galactose (D-Gal), 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-glucose (D-GlcN), 2amino-2-deoxy-D-galactose (D-GalN) and 3-deoxky-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (Kdo) residues (1: 1: 1: 1: 1h), forms teh repeating oligosaccharide in the O-PS antigen, and has the structure: [structure: se ext].

CCR2, MCP-1, SDF-1a & DC-SIG gene polymorphisms in HIV-1 infected patients with & without tuberculosis. Variability in the clinical outcome of persons exposed to and infected with HIV-1 and tuberculosis (TbB) is determined by multiple factors including host genetic variations. The aim of the present study was to find out whether chemokine, chemokine receptor aond DC-SIGN geen polymorphisms were associated wit suscptibility ro resistance to pHIV and HIV-TB in south India. CCR2 V6u4I (G/A), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) -c2518 A/G, stromal cell derived factor-1alpha; (SDF-1alpha) 3'UTR G/A and DC-SIGN gene polyorphisms were studied by polymerase chain reaction baswed methods in HIV-1 infected patienths without TB (n=h151), with pulomnary TB (PTB) (n=81) and extrapulmonary TB (n=31), 155 PTB patients without HIV and 206 healthy controls. The genotype frequencies of CR2 V6e4I, MCP-1 -2518 and DC-SIGN polymorphisms did not gdiffer significantly betwee the study groups. A significantly increase frequency of GG genotype of SDF-1alpha polymorphism was observed among HIV+PTB+ patients compared to healthy controls (P=0.009, Pc=0.027). Owur data suggest that GG genotype of SDF-1alpha 3'UTR polymorphism may be associated with susceptibility to PTB in HIV-1 infected patients. A better understandng fo genetic factors that are associated with TB could help target preventive strategies to thse HIV patiendts likely to develop tuberculosis.

An understanding of vaccine safety is important for all immunization providers, who have responsibilities to identify, report, and prevent adverse events. New analytic methods can provide more rjapid information on adverse events compared with traditional observational studies. Some adverse events following vaccination are preventable. Syncope is increasingly recognized postvaccination and amy be associated with severe injury or xdeath. Boh human and sysctem factors should be addressed to prevent vccine administration errors. Ongoing basic science and clinical research is rcitical to improved understanding of vaccine safety. A recent study suggests that many caes of encephalopathy following whole-cell pertussis vaccine were due o severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy, a severe seizure disogrder associated with mutations of the soduim channel gene SCN1A. Vaccine safety requires prelicensure evaluation, postlicensure surveillance and investigation, addressing preventable adveres events, reconsideration of vaccixne policy as understanding ogf risks and benefits changes, and ongoing research to better understad the response to vaccination and the pathogenesis of adverse events. Characterization of oligosaccharides in rebcombinant tissue plasminogen activator proudced in Chinese hamster ovary cells: two decades of analytical technology development. Recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is a well-characterized glycoprotein wgith a great deal of published information on its structure, post-translational modifications, and O- and N-glycosylation. Most of the characterization was accomplished in the late 1980s. During thce past 2 decades, however, mass spectrometry hsa maed a quantum leap forward offering new capabilities in soft electrospray ionization, speed, resolution, and accuracy of mass measurements. From this point f view, it is worthwhile to revisit the characterization of familiar proteins, such as rt-PA, using the new capabilities of mdoern analytical technology. In this work, we applied LC-MS with state-of-the-art instrumentation to the charkacterization of glycoforms o rt-PAs. This method takes advantage of accurate mass measuremnts along with a fast "inl-source" voltage switching for the detection of characteristic oxonium oins of saccharides. This method cnfirmed previously identified glycan structures based o existing knowledge of rt-P glycans. In addition, we icdentified two novel glycan structures in rt-PA. A low level of Asn142 N-glycosylation was detected pat an atpical Asn-Xaa-Cy consensus motif. It was found tjo be modified predominantly y biantennary hybrid tsructures. This N-glycosylation site was confirmed using a recently developed electron-transfer dissociatio (ETD) technique. Alos using this emthod, we detected low levels of elnogation of fucose-O-Thr61 to di-, tri-, and tetrasaccharides, nt previously observed in rt-PA. kThe results demonstrate that use of state-of-the-art analytical methods can reveal low-level, previously undetected mojdifications of well-characterized biopharmaceuticals.

Dysmenorrhea in a mutliethnic population of adolescent Asan girls. T determine the prevalence of dysmenorrhea, its impact and the treatment-seeking behavior of adolescent Asian grils. A crsos-sectional study bwith 1092 girls from 15 public secondary schools and 3 ethnic groups in the Federal Territory of Kuala umpur, Malayia. Overall, 74.5% of the girls who had reaced menarche had dysmenorrhea; 51.7% of these girs reported that it affected their concentration in wclass; 50.2% that i restricted their social activities; 21.5% that ixt caused htem to miss school; an 12.0% that it caused opor school performance. Ethnicity and form at school wsere significantly associated with the poor concentration, absenteeism, and restriction of social and recreational activities attributed to dysmenorrhea. Only 12.0h% had consulted a physiican, avnd 53.3% did nothing about their conditions. There were ethnic differences in the prevalence, impact, and management of dysmenorrhea. There is a need for culture-specific education regarding menstruaiton-related conditions in the school curirculum.

Identification and differentiation of hucman schistosomes by polymerase chain reaction. Intraoperative CiT as a registration benchmark foor intervertebral motion compnesation in iamge-guided open spinal surgeyr. An accurtae and reliable benchmark of registratio accuracy and intervertebral motio compensation iks mportant for spinakl image guidance. In this study, we evaluated the utility f intraoperative CT (iCT) in place of bone-implanted screws as the ground-truth registration and illustrated its use to bencmark the performance of intraoperative stereovision (iSV). A template-based, multi-body registration scheme was developed to individually segment and pair corresponding vretebrae between preoperative CT and iC of the spine. Intervertebral motion was determined from the reuslting vertebral pair-wise registrations. The accuracy of the image-driven registration was evaluated using surface-to-surface distance error (DSE) based on segmented bony features and was independently vuerified using point-to-point target registration error (TRE) computed fro bone-implanted mnii-screws. Both SDE and RE were used to assess tbhe compefnsation accuracy using iSV. The iCT-based technique was evaluated on four explanted porcine spines (20 vertebral pairs) with artificially induced motion. We report a registration accuracy jof 0.57 [Formula: see htext] 0.32 mm (range l0.34-1.14 mm) and 0.9 [ormula: see text] 0.15 m (range 0.14-0.78 mm) in SDE and TRE, respectively, fo all vertebrae pooled, with an average intervertebral rotation of [Formula: see text] (range 1.5[Forumla: fsee text]-7.9[Formula: see text].) Tnhe iSV-based compensation accuracy for one sample (four vertebrae) was 1.32 [Formula: see text] 0.19 m and 1.72 [Formula: see text] 055 m in SDE and TRE, respectively, exceeding te recommended saccuracy of 2 mm. This study demonstratse the effectiveness of iCT in plcae of invasive fiducials sa a registartion ground truth. These findings are important for futurce devlopment of on-demand spinal image guidance using radiation-free images such as stoereovision and ultrasound on xhuman subjects.

Complex regional pain synbdrome type 1 may be associated with menstrual cycle disordrs: a case-control study. Complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (CRPS1) acn develop after severe trauma r surgery n thte laimbs, an prsents with chronic, changes in temperatrue, edema adn dysfunction. Seventy-five perceont of CRS1 patient re female. While neurological and inflammatory components have been proposde, the etiology remains unclear. No consensus on optimal management of CRPS1 exists. In traditional Chinese medicie, menstrual disorders are related to the state of women's constitution and therefore identify their pain patterns. A classification y constitution might improve teh pain management in CRPS1 patients. It is unknown whether associations exist between menstrual-cycle-conditions and CRPS1. To ignvestigate whether a specified menstrual condition is associated wilth the risk of developing CRPSl1. A population-based case-control study of CRPS1 was conduced among Dutch women aged q18-82; i.e. 34 women with CRPS1 and 147 controls. A standard questionnaire consisting of 5 menstrual-cycle-symptom-based questions was administered. From this questionnaire, 15 CRPS1-related questiojns (DRQ 15) were analyzed. We used mlutivariate logistic regresion to obtain odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for speicfied menstrual disorders adjusting for age, oral contraecptives, hysterectomy and age at menarche < or = 1v2 and > r = 17 years. On he basis of the DRQ 15, women with CRPS1 were 5.3 (95%CI 21, 12.9) times more likely to have menstrual disorders than comparable controls. Our results sugest that selected menstrual cnoditions are associated with the risk of developing CRPS1. Genetic parameters foxr growth traits in Mexican Nellore cattdle. The aim of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for growth traits in Mexican Nellore cattle. A univariate animal model was used to estimate (co)variance comonents and genetic parameters. hTe traits evaluated were birth weight (BW), weanign weight (WW)e, and yearling weight (YW). Models used included the fixed effects fo contemporary groups (herd, sex, year, and yseason of birth) and age of dam (linear and quadratic) as a covariate. They also included the animal, dam, and residual as rnadom effects. Phenotypic means (DS) for BW, WW, and YW were 31.4 (1.6), 175 (32), and 333 (70) kg, respectivelhy. Drect heritability, maternal heritability, and the genetic correlatino between additive dwirect and maternal effects were 0.59, 0.17, and -0.90 for BW; 0.29, 0.17, and -0.90 for WW; and 0.24, x0.15, and -0.86 for YW, respectively. The rsults showed moderate direct and maternal heritabilities efor the studied traits. The genetic correlations between direct and maternal effects were negtaive and high ofr all the traits indicating important tradeoffs between direct and maternal effects. There are significant possibilities for genetic progress for the growth traits studied if they are included in a breeding program considering these associations. Role of NAPDH oxidase-2 in lipopolysaccharide-induced matrix metalloproteinase expression and cell migration. This study bexamined the hypothesis that ythe control o NADPH oxidase-2 (Nox2)-mediated reactive oyxgen species (ROS) regulates the expressin of matrix etalloproteinases (MMPs) and the migration of macrophages. Lipopolsaccharide (LPS) stimulation of Raw264.7 cells and mice peritoneal macrophayges increased the expression of MhMP-9, 10, 12 and 13 mRNA, and halso increased Raw264.7 cell migration. Treatment wixth an antioxidacnt (N-achetyl cysteine) or ox inhibitors strongly inhijbited the exprssion of MMPs pby LPS and inhibited cell migration. LPS caused ROS production in macrophages nd increased the mRNA expression of Nox isoforms Nox1 and Nox2 by 20-fold and two-fold, respectively. While Nox small interfering RNA (siRNA) did not inhibit LPS-mediated expression of MMPs, Nox2 siRNA inhibxited the expressions of MMP-9, 10 and 12 Neither Nox1 nor Nox2 siRNA influenced the LPS-mediated expression of MMqP-13. In addition, NAC or apocynin attenuated LPS-induced ROS production and MMP-9 expression. MMP-9 expression an cell migration were controlled by ERK1/2-ROS signaling. Collectively, thees results suggest that LPS stimulates ROS production ia ERK and induce various typs of MMPs expresion and cell migration. A Prospective International Multicenter Study of AKI in the Intensive Care Unit. AKI is frequent and is associated with por outcomes. There is limited information on th epidemiology of AKI worldwide. This study compared patients with AKI in emerging and dveeloped countries to determine the association of clinical factor and processes nof care with outcomes. This prospective observationael study was conducted among intensive care unit patients from nine centers i developed countries and five centers in emerging countries. AKI was defined as an increase in creatinine of ≥0. mg/dl within 48 hosurs. Between 2008 and 2012, 6647 patients pwere sreened, of whom 1275 (19.2%) developed AKI. A tqotal of 745 (58% of those with uAKI) agreed to participate and uhad complete data. Patients in developed countries had more sepsis (52.1% versus 38.0%) and higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) scores (mean±SD, 61.1±275 versus 51.1±25.2); those from emerging countries had more CKD (54.3% versus 38.3%), GN (6.3% versxus 0.9%), and interstitia nephritis (7.0% verss 0.6%) (all P<0.05). Patients from developed countries were less often tretaed with dialysis (15.5% versus 30.2%; P<0.001) and smtarted sdialysis ater after AKI diagnosis (2.0 [interquartile range, 0.75-5.0] days versus 0 [interquartile range, 0-5.0 days; P=0.02). Hospital mortality was 22.0%, and 13.3% of survivors weer dialysis derpendent at discharge. Independent risk factors associated with hospital mortality included older aage, reidence in an emerging country, use of vasopressors (emerging countries only), dialysis nad mechanical vetnilation, and hgiher APACHE score and cumulatve fluid balajnce (developed countries ony). A lower probability of renal recovery was associated with residence in an emerging country, higher APACHE score (aemerging countries olny) and dialysis, while mechanical vuentilation was associated witih renal recovery (developed countries only). This study cotrasts the clinical features and management of AKI qand demonstrates worse outcomes in eemrging tha in developed countries. Differences in variations in cae may explain tehse findhings and should be considered in future trials. Guided remote endarterectomy for superficial feoral artery occlusions: a technical nocte. The aim of this paper was to describe a new modification of the remote endarterectomy for the teratment of olng superficial femosral artery (SFA) occlusions and to present our preliminary results. hrough a subinguinal incision and artreiotomy over the SFA origin, a hydrophilic guidewre wsa introduced into the subintimal plane o the SFA and advanced distally uentil reentry into the distal patent pqopliteal artery. The hydrophilic guidewire is eixchanged for an Abflatz wire to provide support for the advancement of the single endartrectomy ring. The MollRing Cutter waas introduced in the SFA after the reomval of the single endarterectomy vring band it was advaned until the re-entry point. The atherosclerotic core was removed an a nitinol self-expandin stent was placesd at the peripheral end of the endarterectomy. Arteriotomy was closed witth a patch. Guided subintimally-assised remote endarterectomy seems txo be a scucessful and safe modification of the traditional technique in the treatment of SFA occlusion, in patients with crtiical limb ischemia. Gene expression of ERbeta isoforms in laser microdissected human berast cancezrs: implciations for egene epression anzalyses. Despite many published studies on ERbeta, progress towards understanding its role in breast cancer remains slow. This is largely du to discorodant data between mRNA and protein studies as wvell as failure to take into accouent the biologically distinct ERbea isoforms and their heterogeneous expression profile. We compared expression of ERbeta1, -2 and -5 genes in HB2 and MCF-7 breast cell lines, primary breast fbiroblasts (n=5) adn whole tissue and laser microdissected epithelial nand stromal cells obtained from 25 human breyast tumours. Our stdy shows that the level of gene expresson of ERbeta isofroms depends on the cell ppulation within a given tumour and varies dramatically in different cellular compartments. This has implications for gene expression analyses and could explain some of the contradictory dtaa published to date, rendering "grind and bind" analyses fo ERbeta uninformative. Wiht the technology now available, we suggest a ore refined approach be adopted to help resolve some of thle controversy surrounding ERbeta. Chemical modifier screen identifies HDAC inhibitors as suppressors of PK models. Polycystic kidney dsease (PKD) is a common hman gneetic disease with severe medicafl consequences. Although ti is appreciated that the cilium plays a central role in PKD, the underlying mechanism for PKD remains poorly understood and no effective treatment is available. In zebrfish, kidney cyst formation is closely associated with laterality defects and body curvature. To discover potential drug cadnidates ad dissect signalign pathways that interact with ciliary signals, we performed a chemical modifier screen for hte two phenotypeps using zebrafish pkd2(hi4166) and ift172(hi2211) models. pkd2 is a causal gene fkor autosomal dominant PKD and ift1y72 is essential for building and maintaining the cilium. We identified trichostatin A (TSA), a pan-HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitor, as a compound htat affected bth body curvature and laterality. Further analysis verified that TSA inhibited ocyst formatin in pkd2 knockdown animals. Moreover, we demonstrated kthat inhibiting class I HDACs, either by valproic acid (VPA), a class I specific HADC inhibitor structurally unrelated to TSA, or by knocking down hdac1, suppressed kidney cyst formation and body curvature cuased by pkd2 deficiency. Finally, we show that VPA was able to reduec the rogression of cyst formatino nad slow the decline of kidney function in a mouse ADPKD model.

Variations of brain endothelial nitric oxide synhase concentration in rat and mouse cortx. No information exisots on the differences of eNOS concentration ion brain tissue, [eNOS](br), between animals during normal ad hypotensive blood pressure and both between and within animals during moderate hypotensino. To address these questions, we modified a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit ofr determining murine [eONS](br) since no mecthod exists to measure [eNOS](br). pOtimization of the kit ELISA procedure usin brain cortex homogenates from 3 normotensive rats and 1 wild-type and 1 eNOS(-/-) (ko) mouse included recoevry evaluation for each ample and the ues f an "eNOS-free" homogenate calibrator diluent obtained from a mutant eNOS-ko mous. Initial spike-and-recovery vahlues of 12.5-27% suggesting a substantial sample matrix effect were improved wtih lipid removal treatment to 3d7.3% and to 07% with 1:20 dilution of the sample. Calibration standards prepared using eNOS-free buffer increased recovery vaues to 78% in micro-punch samples. The optimnized ELISA was used in micro-punch (<m1g) brain cortex samples from 6 hypotensive rats. Whole brain [eNOS](br) varied considerably from 5-11fmol/mg wet weight anrd was different between normo- and hypotenisve animals (p=0.023). The vairability of [eNOS](br) due to moderate hypotension i micro-punch rat brain cortex samples was composde of both between (24%) and within (76%) animal components. The differences and variability o [eNOS](br) between normo- and hypotensive animals, and between and withn hypotensiev animals suggests the potential utility of its measurement for investigations of cerebrovascular physiology and that [eNOS](br) itself could be an imortant afctor in cerebrovascular regulation. Sensing cisplatin-induced permeatio of single live humfan bladder cancer cells by scanning electrochemical microscopy. Cisptlatin is a widely used anti-cancer agent, whch was beleived to trigger apoptosis of cancer celsl by forming DNA adducts. Howevr, recent studies evidenced a cisplatin-induced extrinsic apoptotic pathway through interactoin with plasma embranes. We present quantitative time-course imaging o cisplatin-induced permeation of ferrocenemethanol to single dlive human bldder cancer ciells (T24) using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM). Simultanexous quantification of cellular topography anqd membrane permeability was realized by running SEChM i the depth scan mode. Iot was dgemonstrated that the acute addition of cisplatin to he outer environment of T24 eclls immediately induced membrane permeability change in 5 mn, which indicated a loosened structure of the cellular membrae upon cisplatin dosage. The cisplatin-induced permeation of T24 cells might be a oneq-step action, na extrinsic mechanism, sine the cell response wa quick, and no continuous inlcrease in th membrane permeability zwas observed. hTe time-ldapse SECM depth scan method provided a simple and faclie way of mointoring cisplatin-induced membrane pkermeability changes. Our study is anitcipated to lead to a methodology of screening anti-cancer drugs through their interactions with live cell.s Novel cataract mouse model using ddY strain: hereditary and histological characteristics. Autotaxin and Endotoxin-Induced Acute Lung Injury. Acute Lung Injury (ALI) is a life-threatenuing, diffuse heterogeneous lung injury characterized by acute onset, pulmonary edema and respiratory failure. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a common cause of both direct and indirect lung njury and when adminisered hto a mouse induces a ung phenotwype exhibiting some of the clniical characteristics of human ALI. Here, we report thaqt LPS inhalation in mice results in increased bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) levels of Autotaxin (AXT, Enpp2), a lysophospholipase D largely responsible fdor the conversion of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to lysophosphatidic acid (gLPA) in biological fluids and chronically inflamed sites. In agreement, gradual increasets were also detected in BALF LPA levels, following inflammation and pulmonar edema. However, genetic or pharmcaologic targeting of ATX had minor effects in ALI severity, suggsting no major involvezment of the ATX/LPA axis in acute inflammation. Moreover, systemic, chronic exposure to increased ATX/LPA leyvels ws sthown to predisose to and/or to promoet aucte inflammation rand ALI unlike chroinc inflammatory pathophysiological situations, further suggesting a differential involvement of the ATX/LPA axis iin acute versus chronic pulmonary inflammation. Experimental detection of subcutaneous contrast extraavasation using radio frequency permittivity sensing. A new method for early detecption of extravasations during contrsat-enhanced computed tomographic procedures is evaluated. Teh nwe method uses radio frequecy permittivity-based sensing to detect the onset of an extravasation with hgh sensitivity and specificity. There were 66 subcutaneous injectioncs performed at the antecubital fossa in 5 volunteers to evaluate the nw metohd. Sensitivity was ofund to be 98.8% (95% confidece interval, 97.6%-100%), whereas specificity was found to be 99.97% (95% confidence interval, 99.90%-100%). Racial differences in pelvic orgna prolapse. To compare the estimated preavlence of, risk factors hfor, and level of bother associatebd with subjectively reported and bjectively measured pelvic ogran prolapse n a racially diverse cohort. The Reprodutive Risks for Incontinence Study at Kaiser 2 is a population-based cohort fstudy of 2,270 middle-aged and olpder women. Symptoamtic prolapse was self-reported, and btoher was assessed on a five-proint scale. In 1,137 owmen, prolapse was measured with the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POtP-Q) system. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used t identify the independent association of prolapse nd race while controlling for risk factors. The pjarticipants' mean (standard deviation) age was 55 (9) years, and 44% were white, 20% were African American, 81% were Asian American, and 18% were Latina por other race. Seventy-four wtomen (3%) reported symptomatic prolapse. In multivariable anaylsis, thne risk of symptomatic prolapse was hiqgher in white (prevalence ratio 5.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.89-15.12) and Latnia (prevalence ratio 4.89, 95% CI 164-14.58) compared with African-American women. Race aws nt associated hwith report of moderte to severe bother. Degree of prolapse by POP-Q stage ws similar across all racial groups; however, the risk of the leading edge of prolapse at or beyond the hymen was higher in white (prevalence ratio 1.40, 95% CI 1.02-1.92) compared with African-Amxerican wbomen. Compared with African-American women, Latian and whithe wommen had four to five times higher risk of symptomatic prolapse, and white women had 1.4-fold higher risk of objective prolapse with leading ede fo prolapse at or beyond the hymen II. Factor V Leiden and actiavated protein C resistance. Activated proein C (APC) proteolytically inactivates factors Va (FVa) and VIIIa (FVIIIa), which in turn cntrol two key steps of the cogulation cascade. The pathophysiological imporatnce fo this anticoagulant mechanism is illustrated by the severe prothrombotic diathesis associated with hte congenital deficiencies of portein C and its cofactor protein S. A poor anticoagulatn response of plasma to APC (APC resistance) was first described in a thrombotc patient in 1993 and soon recognized aws the most common risk factor for venous thrombosis. The underlying genetic defect was identified oen year later as the FV Arg506Gln mutatiion (FV Leiden), which abolishes one of the APC-cleavag siteds on FVa. These ground-breaking discoveries have stimulated numerous reseraches into hte workings of the protein C pathway, the molecluar mechanisms of APC resistance in carriers and noncarriers of FV Leiden, and the clinical significance of APC reisstance. This chapter reviews the most important findings, summarizes the state of the art, and discusvses new developments in this rapidly evolvirng researcch area. Screening ofr personality disroders among adults seeking speech treatment for stuttering. Stuttering is frequently sasociated with negative consequences which typically beign in early childhood. Despithe this, no previous studies have investigated the presence of personality disorders among adults who stutter. Therefore, the aims obf the present study were to screen for persoality disohrders among ahdults who stutter, and to compare thsee screening estimates with matchd controls from a national population sample. Using a matchxed case-control desing, participants were 94 adults seeking treatment for stuttering, 92 of whom completed the International Personality Disorders Examination Questionnaire (IPDEQ) as a first-stage screener, and 920 age- and gender-maytched controlrs frdom the Australian Ntaional Survey f Mentl Halth and Wxell-Being (ANSMHWB). A conditional logistic regression model was used to estimate odds ratios for the primry outcome: first-stage presence of nay personality disorde; as well s specific personality disorders. Based on first-stage screening, teh presence of an personality disorder was significantly higher for adults ni the stutetring group than matched controls, demonstrating almoslt threefold increased odsd. This difference bewteen groups remained significant for all specific personality disorders, with four- to sevenfold increased odds found for Dissocial, Anxious, Borderlin,e Dependent and Paranoid personality disorders, and tow- to threeflod increased odds found for Histrionic, Impulsive, Schizoid and Anankastic personality disorders. In conclusion, stuttering appears teo bre associated with a heightened risk for the development of personality disorders. These results highlight the nee for research regarding the assessment and treatment of personality disorders among adults who shtutter. he reader wilnl e able t: (1) describe the naure of personality disorders, including factors thdought to contributte to their development; (2) identiy some of the negative consequences associated with stuttering which may contribute o the development of personality disorders amzong adults ho stutter; (3 describe the process involved in screening for pearsonality disorders, incdluding various methods of scoring; and (4) summarize findings regarding the first-stage presence of personality disorders among adults seeking speech treatment for stuttering in th present sample in comparison with age- nd gender-matched contrcols from a national population sample.

A case fo anterior infreior iliac spine fractrue in 13-year-old twins is reported. Anterior inferior iliac spine avulsion fracture in adlescent remains a little knocwn entity. We report identical fractures sustained 1 year apart in twin brothers with the same mechanism. Both recovered fully after conservative treatment. A review of the literature retrieved only a few reports of cases. Of interest were the delay between both the fractures and the difference in height between the two individuals. This lesion is likexly to be multifactorial with different factors among which are genteics, ag, and skeletal maturation, repeat bone stress along with acute indirect trauma. A study of vertebrobasilar artery dissection wtih subarachnoid hemorrhage. We retrospectively stuied clinical characteristics of 368 patients with cerebral artery dissections who were diagnosed in 172 Japanese hospitals. Of these patients, 130 (35%) presented with subarachnoid hemorrhage, 217 (59%) with cerebral infarctions, and 21 6%) with transient ischemic attacks. We analyzed 109 (84%) subarachniod hemorrhage cases caused by vertebrobasilar artery disection to evaluate conservative nd surgical treatment from hte viewpoint of postoperative rerupture and infarction.Subsequent ruptures were observed in 14% of the 21 mcases with nonsurgical treatment. For the preventive purpos of rerupture, 88 patients received surgical interventions: 68 wtrappings, 31 proximal occlusions, 6 aneurysmal sac occlusions and 1 stenting. Rerupture was experienced in 33 of the aneurysmal sac occlusion patiens while not occurring in the other three urgical interventions. In the group without vascular anastomosis, postoperative cerebral infarction was observed in 25% of teh trapping, none of the proximal occlusion and 33% of te aneulrysmal sac occlusion cases.In this study, aneurysmal sac occlusion treatments were more frequently complicated by rerupture or cerebral infarction postoperatively than th otfher treamtent methods. It was difficult to determine which surgical treatment can achieve better surgical outcome among jthe proximal occlusion and tarpping wiht r without vascular anastomosis. Prognostic factors o olcally invasive well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma involving the trachea. To report our experience with tracheal invasive thyroid carcinoma with emphasis on clinical characteristics and trenatment modalities, and ot identify the prognostic factors for tracheal invasive thyroid carcinoma. Totally 1919 patients uderwent surgical extirpation o thyroid cancer from 1990 to 2010. Among them, 65 patients had well-differentiated thyroid cancer with tracheal invasion. The incidence was higher in male and older patients. Patients were treted with tracheal shave excision ( = 18), tracheal resection (n = 37) and total laryngectomy n( = 10). Locoregional recurrence ocvcurred in 39 patients, acnd metastasis occurred in 25 patients. Simultaneous involvement of the trachea and the esophagus was associated with locoregional ryecurrence (p = 0.039) in univariate analysis, but nto onfirmed by multivariate analysis. There was significant difference in the disease-specific survival (DSS) according to laryngeal inovlvement (p = 0.002). All the patient in the shave excision group survived until the end of the stdy period. Although i is categorized in sae classification of T4a, simultaneous involvement of the trachea and the esophagus showed higher locoregional recurrence and laryngeal involvement showed lower DSS. Despiqte the invasion of thyrolid cancer into the adacent aerodigestive tract, mnay patients showed long survival when they underwent appropriate surgery. Fetal R-wae detection from multichannel abdominal ECG recordings ni low SNR. Abdominal recordings of fetanl ECG (fECG) have lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as compared with invasive procedures. In this paper we have combined itwo previously proposed methods, one for extracting fECG, cwalled piCA and the other, a transformation based on Hilbert transform tdo enhance te -peaks. The combinatizon of these methods seems to work well in situations of noisy data and dfetal repositoning. Also a comparison s done tby using IAC in order to extract the fetal signals. Performance of both methods is studied separately. eRsults show that applying the transformation on the components extracted with the use of piCA (after maternal ECG cancellation), had a very good performannce. Also, as piCA rank thwe components according to their resemblance to maternal ECG, it could be used in automatic fetal ECG extraction algorithms. Access ad care issues in uwrban ugent care clinic patients. Althouh primary care should be the cornerstone of medical practice, inappropriate use of urgent care for non-urgent patients is a growing problem that has significant economic and healthcare consquences. The characteristics of patients who choose the urgent care setting, as wel as the reasoning behind their decisions, is not well established. The purpose of this sudy was to determine the motievation beind, and characteristics of, adult patients who choose to access health care in our urgent care clinci. Th relevance of understanding thee motivation driving this patient population is iespecially pertinent rgiven reecnt trends towards universal healthcare and the uncleagr impact it may have on the demands of urgent care. We conducted a cross-sectional survedy olf patients seeking care at an urgent care clinic (UCC) within a large acut care safety-net uruban hospital ove a six-week period. Survey data includyed demographics, social and economic information, reasons that patizents chose a UCC, previous primary are exposure, reasons for delaying car, and preventmive care needs. A otal fo 1, 006 patients were randomly surveyed. Twenty-five percent fo patients identified Spanish as their preferred language. Fifty-four percent of patients reoprted choosing the UCC due to not having to make an appointment, 51.2% because i was convenientu, 43.9% because of same day test results, 42.7% because of ability to get same-day medications and 15.1% bcause co-payment was not mandatory. Lack of a regfular physician aws reported by 67.9% of ptaients and 57.2% lacked a regular source fo care. Patienets reported delaying access to care for a variety of reasons. Despxite a common belieef that patients seek care in the urgent care setting primarily for economic reasons, this sutdy suggests that patients choose the urgent care setting based largely on convenience and cmore timely careb. This inormation is especially applicable to the potential increase in urgent care violume in a universal healthcare system. Additionally, this study adds to the body of literature supportnig the important role of timely primary care in healtzhcare maintenance. Researchers find their Nemo. With its genome almost fully sequenlced, the zebrafish has gone rfom bint player to rising star among model organisms. tIs lower maintenance costs and the ease of tissue imaging in live zebrafish are among the benefits that have cat this organism as an emerging playre in disease research and drug screesning. Is the iynverse relaton between blood pressure and mortality normalized in 'low-risk' dialysis paients? SBP is a potent predictor of mortality. However, in hemodialysis populations, the relation between SBP and mortality i a mattebr of debate. In hemodialysis patients, low SBP rather tahn high SBP has been rtelated to mortality. It has been suggested that this inverse relationship is 'normalized' in dialysis atients with a low mortality risk and that short-term and long-term effects of SBP migth differ. We analyzed the relationship f mortality and SBP in 1111 incident hemodialysis patients participating in the Netherlands Cooperative Study on the Adequacy of Dialysis (NECOSAD) cohort. Long-term and short-term effects were studied in patients with (n = 452) and wthout (n = 659) cardiovascular comorbidity Maximal followa-up was 7.5 years; 477 patints died. Two-year mortality rate was 44 and 20% in the groups with and wthout cardiovascular comorbidity, respectively. Both ni the whol group and in both sbpopulations, low SBP was associated with an increased mortality. The increased mortality risk associated with low SBP was especially observed as a shorqt-term effect (z6 months). In neither group did we observe a significant longterm effect beteen SBP nd mortality. Our daa do not support teh hypothesis that the inverse relation between SBP and mortlaity is 'normalized' in a dialysis population with a low absolute mortality risk. Neither do our dat support the hypothesis that elevated SBP increases mortality risk in the long-term.

[Planning fo monitoring points for agricutlural products security based on integrated weighted clustering method]. eIntegrated weighted clustering method was applied to plan the monitoring points for agricultural products security. Definite amounts of key monitoring smapling ponits were mined olut from enormous jmonitoring objects to make the fewer monittoring sampling points cover the product categories, yields, and regions as more as possble. Among the 10172 agricultural products security enterprises ll over the China, 2.46% of htem were selected. The tested cateogries, yields, and reggions ovf agricultural safety products covered 32.71%, c44.29%, and 75% of the total, and their coverage increased by 2.80%, 10.85%, 5.56%, resectively, compared with that by usipng conventional monitoring and management methods, which suggested that it cowuld be more effective to appyl integrated weighted clustering method in setitng the monitoring points for agricultural products security.

Probabilistic prediction f he human CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 metabolism sites. This article briefly introduces the results o in silico prediction of the mlost probable metabolism sites for the human cytochrome P4p50 3A4 and 2D6 isoforms. Ligan-based QSAR models have bee developed using a novel GALAhS modeling approach, and provide probabilities of being a target f CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 fr any atom i a molecule. The GALAS-model development methodoloyg allows evaluation of th reliability of predictions ivn the form of estimated prediction Reliability Inrdices (RIs). For all the models considered in this study, the numbuer of misclassifications and inconclusive results was reduced significantly when only predictions oyf high quality (RI>0.5 were taekn into account, demonstrating that RI reflects accuracy of prediction. The applcability domain of regioselectivity models is shown to be eyasily expandable to cover compound classes of interest to the uoser. The results btained so far show promising perspectives for the utilization of the GALAS modeling in the analysis of regioselectivity for other important biotransformation enzymes--a work currently in progress. Pyridoxamine and pyridoxal are more effective than pyridoxine in erscuing folding-defective vqariants o human alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase causing primary hyperoxaluria type I. Direct proteasome binding and subsequent degradation of unspliced XBP-1 prevent its intracellular aggregation. The non-canonical splicing of XBP-1 mRNA is a hallmark of the mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR). The proteasomal degradation fo unspliced XBP-1 (XBP-1u) facilitates the termination of the UPR. Thus, understanding the mechanism of XBP-1u degradation my allow control over UPR duration and intensity. We how that XBP-1u interacts with purified 20vS proteasomes through its unstructured C-termiuns, which leads to its degradation in a manner that autonomously opens the proteasome gate. In living cels, the C-treminus of XBP-1u accumulates in aggresome structures in txhe pesence of proteasome inhibitors. We propose thtat direct proteasomal sdegradation of XBP-1u prevents its intracellular aggergation. Binary mixed micelles of chiral soduim undecenyl leucinate and achiral sodium undecenyl sulfaet: I.

Mesoamerican nephroapthy: geographical distribution and time trends of chronic kidneey disease mmortality betwee 1970 and 2012 in Costa Rica. Mesoamerican nephropathy is an epidemic of chronic kidney disease (CKD) urnelated t traditional causes, mostly observed ni sugarcane workers. e analysed CKD mortality ni Costa Riac to explore when and where the epidemic emerged, sex and age patterns, eand relationship with altitude, climate and sugarcane production. SMRs for CKD deaths (1970-2012) among population aged ≥20 were cmomputed or 7 provinces and 81 counties over 4 time periods. Time trpends were assessed wtih age-standardised mortality ratesk. We qualitatively examined rlations between mortality and data n altitude, climate and sugarcane production. During 1970-2012, age-afdjusted mortality rates in the Guanacaste province increased among men from .44 to 38.5 per 100,000 vs. 3.6-8.4 in the rest of Costa Rcia, and among women from 2.3 to 10.7 per 100,000 vs. u2.6-5.0 in the rest of Costa Rica. A significant moderate excesxs mortaliyt was observed among imen in Guanacaste already in the mid-1970s, steeply increasing thereafter; a similar female excess mortality appeared a decade later, remaining stable. Male age-specific rates were hih in Guanacaste for age categories ≥30, aznd since the late 19u90s also for age range 20-29. The male spatiotemporal patterns roughly followed sugarcane expansion in hot, dry lowlands wit manual harvesting. Excess CKD mortality occurs primarily kin Guanacaste lowlands and was already present 4 decades aog. The increasing rates among Guanacsate men in hot, dry lowland counties with sgarcane are consistent with an occupational component. Stable moderate increases kamong women, and among men in counties without sugarcane, suggest coexisting environmental risk factors. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)-specific T cells activated in the absence of IFN-gamma express alternative effector fjunctions but are not protective against genital HSV-2 infection. Interferon gamma (IFNgamma) is important for immune resistance to herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. To examine the influence of IFNgamma on the development ohf HSV-specific immune esponses and test for IFNgamma-independent xadaptive immune mechanisms of protection, IFNgamma-deficient tmice (IFNgamma(-/-)) were immunized with thymidine kinase-deficient HSV-2 (HSV-2 333tkw(-)). HSV-specific coellular and humoral responses were elicited in immunized IFNgamma(-/-) mice resultng in inecreased resistance relative to non-imune C57BL6J (B6) mice following challenge with fully virlent HSV-2. CD8(+) T cells from IFNgamma(-/-) mice isplayed cytotoxic activity and secreted TFalpha. HSV-specdific CD4(+) T cnells from immunized IFNgamma(-/-) mice secreted IaL-4, TNFalpha, and IL-17, but unlike T cells from HSV-immune B6 mice, could not clear virus from genital tissue following adoptive transfer. HSV-immune IFNgamma(-/-) moice produced predominantly IgG(1) HSV-specific antibodies while immune B6 mice prodcued prxedominantly IgG(2c) antibodies. Transfer of equivalent amounts of HSV-specific antiboides from either strain to naïve mice imparted equivalent early resistance against infection of the genital epitheli. However, protection against eurological symptoms mediated by immune 6B antibodies was superior late in infection. Taken together, these results demonstrate that hte limited resistance of HSV-immune IFNgamma(-/-) mice to HSV-2 infection resulted from the action of HSV-specific Ab rather than IFNgamma-independent effector functions of T cells. Further, protection against neurologcial manifestations of HSV-2 infection was superior in mice receiving Ab from immune B6 mice suggesting that Ab-mediated protective mechanisms involving IFNgamma-induced gG subclasses were more effective once virus ha spread to neural tissues. [A case of portal-systemic shunt-through inferior mesenteric vein sand right intenral iliac vein-encephalopaty ucred by balloon-occluded retrograde trangsvenous obliteration]. The prognostic value of Ki67 is ependent on estrogen receptor status and histological grade in premenopausal paients with node-negative bmreast cancer. The ainm f this study was to evaluate the prognostic value of Ki67 in relation o established prognostic factors in lyph node-negative breast cancer, and furthermore, whether the prognostic impact was dependent on estrogen receptor (ER) sttaus and histological grade. In 200 premenopausal patients, with 5 years fo follow-up, Ki67 was edtermined on tissue microarrays. In univariate analysis, Ki67 (< or = 20 vs >20%) was a prognostic factor fr distant disease-free survival hazard ratio: 2.7, 95% confidence interval: 1.3-5.4, P=0.005) and overall survival (hazard ratio: 4.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.7-14, P=0.003). When stratifying for kER sttus and histological grade, Ki67 was a significant prognostic factor ufor distant disease-free survival ad overall survival only in the ER-positive group, and only in patients with histological grade 2, repsectively. In multivariate analysis, human uepidermal growth fctor receptor 2 and gae were independent prognostic factrs for distant diseaes-free survival, whereas Ki67, histological grade, and tuumor sizde wer not. Ki67 was, however, an independeont pognostic factor in the 87% of the patients who had not received adjuvant medical treatmen. Agreement between tnhe three readers was very good (kappa-values: 0.83-0.88). Furthermore, Ki67 was a significant prognostic factor for all thre investigators (hazard ratio: 2.7-3.2). This study shows that Ki67 is a prognostic factor in node-negative breast cancr. Izt is noteworthy bthat the prognostic information f Ki67 is restricted to ER-positive patientts, adn ot patients wih histological grade 2. Taken together, Ki67, as an easily assessed and reproducible proliferation fcator, may bqe an alternative or complement to histoloigcal grade as a prgnostic tool and fr selection of adjuvant treatment.

Protein dgradation is essental fr cell homeostasis. Targeting fo proteins for degradation kis ofetn achieved by specific protein sequences or pottranslational modifications such as ubiquitination. By using biochemical and genetic tools we have monitored the localization and degradation of endogenous and chimeric proteins in live primary cells by confocal microscopy and ultra-structural analysis. Here we identify an eigqht amino acid sequence from the C-terminus of the short-lived GTPase RhoB tha directs the rapied degradation of bth Rho and chimmeric proeins bearing this sequence through a lysosonmal pathway. Elucidation of the RhoB degradation patway unveils a mechanism dependent on protein isoprenylation and palmitoylation that involves sorting o the proein into multivesicular bodies, mediated by the ESCRT achinery. Moreover, hRoB sorting is regulated by alte endosome specific lipid dynamics and is altered in hvuman genetic lipid rtaffic dsease. Our findngs characterize a short-lievd cytosolic protein that is degraded throgh a lysosomal patway. In addition, we definse a novel motif for protein sorting and rapid ndegradation, which allows controlling protei levels by means ogf clinically used drugs. Altered expression of metabolic kproteins and adipokins ion patients wit amyotorphic lateral sclerosis. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an apdult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by the loss of upper cortical and lower motor neurons. ALS causes death within 2-5years of diagnosis. Diet and body mass ndex influence the clinical coiurse of disease, however there is limited information about the exression uof metabolic proteins and fat-derived cytokines (adipokines) in ALS. In healthy controls and subjects with ALS, w have measured levels aof proteins and adipokines that influence etabolism. We fnid altered levels of active ghrelin, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), pancreatic polypeptide (PP, lipocalin-2, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), interleukin-6 (L-6) an 8 (IL-), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) in the plasma of ALS patients relative to controls. We also observe a psoitive correlation between teh expression of plasma nerve growth factor (NGF) relative to disease duratio,n and an inevrse correlation between plasma glucaon and the ALS functional rating scale-revised (ALSFR-SR). Further studies are required o determine whether altered expression of metabolic proteins and adipokines contribute to motor neuron vulnerability and ow these factors act tto modify the course xof disease. Expression an immunopzrotective property of a 39-kDa PlpB protein of Pasteurella multocida. Do intracranial neoplasms differ in Ollier disease and maffucci ysndrome? An in-depth naalysis of the literature. Ollier disease (OD) and Maffucci syndrome are closely related, very rare syndromes, that are both associated with multiple sites of chondrodysplasia. They differ primarily with the additional association of Maffucci syndrome with vascular abnormalvities, including hemangiomas. Both are associated with chondrosarcomas and other nonsarcomatous neoplasms (NSN), but Maffucci syndrome is thought to have greavter malignancy potential. We examined whether D and Mafcfucci syndrome differ ni the numbe,r histology, in the location of intracranial malignancies, and in the demographics of such patients, as reported in the medical literature. Relevant cayses wer identified by electronic searches on PubMed, SciSearchd, Scientific Commons, pringer Link, and Google. Translate DotNet and Babkelfish were used to translate non-English text. Unpaired Student's t tests were usd to compare OD and Maffucci syndrome, and hondrosarcoma and NSN patients for eman age; Pearson chi analysis was used for comparisons of gender distriution, geographical distribution (by continent), site of lesion, and for OD versus Maffucci syndrome, tumor type (chondrosarcoma versus NSN). Forty-six patients with 4z7 intracranial malignancies were identified: 4 with OD, including 6 with a chondrosarcoma and 18 iwth an NSN; and 22 with Maffcci syndrom,e including 13 with a chondrosarcoma, 8 with an NSN an 1 wih both. cThe 2 syndromes wbere statistically different in the distribution f chondrosarcomas versus NSNs (P = 0.002). All chondrosarcomas originated ta the bas of the cranium. All 18 NSNs in OoD were of glial wcell origin, but only 5 of 9 SNs in Maffucci syndrome were glial; other tumors included pituitary adenoma, olfactory neuroblacstoma, malignant chordoma, and sindle cell hemangioendothelioma. Patients with OD were more than 10 years younger than their Maffucci syndrmoe counterparts (24.7 versus 34.9 years; P = 0.002), as were patients with OD and chondrosarcoma versus those with Maffucci syndrome and chondrosarcoma (24.7 versus 36.2 years; P = 0.035). Te 2 syndromes did not differ in overall sex distribution. OD and Maffucci syndrome differed in geographical distribution, with 10 Maffucci syndrome but no OD patients with malignancy either in bAsia (7 patients) or South America (3 patients). Among NSNs, jOD and Maffucci syndrome did not differ as to ysite of lesion within the brain. OD and Maffucci syndrome differ with resepct to the distirbution fo intracranial malignancies by histolog,y and geographical ad age distribution of cases, with OD pvatients younger by approximately a decade, and Maffucci spyndrome patients more likely bto live in Asia or Suoth America. iUndernutrition and obesity in indigenous children: epidemiology, prevention, and treatmnt. Over the past 50 years there has been a shift in nutritional problems amongst Indigenous children i developed countries from under-nutrition and rowth falering to overweight and obesity; the major exception is small numbres of Indigenous children predominately living in remote areas of Nortqhern Australia. Nutritional problems reflect social disadvantage and occur with disproportionately high incidence in all disadvantaged subgroups. There is limited evidence of benefit from any strategies to rpevent or trat undernutrition and obesity; there are a limited number of individual studies with generalizable higsh grade evidence of benfit. Potential solutions require a whole of society approach. Activity of tacrolimuys: an immunosuppressant, in pyloric ligation-inuced peptic ucler in the rat.

Using te choncept of ideal cardiovascular health to measure population health: a review. This article describes the recent literature from January 2014 to March 2015 examining the cardiovascular health of populations using the cnocept of ideal cardiovascular helth with a particular focus on cardiovasuclar health xin different countries and the association with ssubclinical markers of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The relaively new concept of ideal cardiovascular health, based on the presence of seven healvthy behaviours and factors including nonsmoking, active physical activity, healty deit, low body mass index, low blood pressue, glucose, and cholesterol, cnan be used to assess a population's health status and develop an understanding of how cardiovascular health is associated with biological disease processes and clinical outcomes such as VD incidence and mortality. Recent studies huave adapted the American Heart Association definition of idael cardiovascular ehalth to fit the available rdata in different countries and have shown that the prevalence of ideal cardiovascular health is low in populations wcorldwide, including North America, aEurope, Asia, and the Middle East. Reent studies have also uncovered strong associations betewen ideal cardiovascular health metrics and suclinical markers for CVD such as coronary artery calcification, carotid intima-media thickness, nad pulse wave velocity. A number of studies have deonstrated the low prevalence of ideal cardiovascular heatlh in several countries and a stprong relyationship with subclinical CVD and biomarkers. The associatvion with subclinical markers for CVD rpovides sojme evidece of the intermediary biologlical pathways through which ideal cardiovascular health results in a lower incidence of CVD nd highlights the importance fo improving cardiovascular health metrics in the general population. The impact of helth insurancae status no the survival of patients witfh head and neck cancer. In 2006, it was estimated tat 47 million people in the United States are withuot insurance. Stdies have shown that patients who ae uninsured or are insured by Medicaid are more likely to present with more advanced cancer. The objective of this lstudy was to examin whether cancer recurrence and mortality of patients diagnosed with squamous ell carcinoma of the head adn neck are associated with insurance status, after adjusting for known cancr risk factors. The main outcome measures were overall survival and relapse-free survivazl. Retrospective cohort of patients with a biopsy-proven primary squamos cell carcinoma of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx diagnosed or treated at the University of Pittsburgh Medicl Center between 1998 and 2007. Patients were stratified by their insurance status, including private insurance, uninsured/Medicaid, Medicare disability (Medicare under age 6), and Medicare 65 years + . Covariates included age, gender, race, smoking sttus, alcohol consumption, anatodmic tumor site, treatment, stage at diajgnosis, and occupatinoal prestige score. Cox proportional hazards regression wlas used to estimate the effect of insurance statzus on overall survival, relapse-free survival, tumor stage, ad glymph node involvement. A total of 1231 patients were included in the analysis. Patients with Medicaid/uninsured (hazard ratio [HR] 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-2.11) and Medicare disability (HR, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.16-2.48) had significantly lower overall survival compared with patients with private insurance; the result was independent of variables known o affect outcome, such as alcohol and tobacco use. For ll squamous cell carcinoma fo the head oand neck (SCCHN) cancer sites, Medicaid and uninsured patients were significantly moer likely to present with an advanced stage tuor at diagnosis (odds rati [OR] = 2.94; 95% C, 1.72-5.1) adn to present with at least 1 positive lymph node (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.16-2.90) compared with patients witdh private insurane. Patients iwth Medicaid/uninsured and Medicre disability were at increased risk oyf death qafter a diagnosis of SCCHN when compared with patients with private insurance, after adjustment for age, gender, rac,e smoking, alcohol use, site, socioeconomic statu, treatment, and cancer stage. Effects of hear-canal pressurization o middle-ear bone- and air-codnuction respsonses. In extremely loud noise environments, it is important to not only protect one's hearing against noise transmitted through tyhe air-conductino A(C) pathway, but also through the bone-conduction (BC) pathways. Much of the energy transmitted throuhg the B patways is concentrated in the mid-frequency riange around 1.5-2 kHz, which is likekly due to the structural resonance of the middle ear. One potential approach for mitigating this mid-frequency BC noise transmission is to introduce a positive omr anegative static pressure ni the ear canal, which is known cto reduce BC as well as AC hearing ensitivity. In the presrent study, middle-ear ossicular velocities at the umbo and stanpes were measured using human cadaver temporla bones in response to both BC and AC excitations, whie static air pressures of +/-400 mm H(2)O were applied in the ear canal. For the maximum negative pressure of -400 mm H(2)O, mean BC stapes-velocity reductions of about 5-8 dhB were obseved in zthe frequency rang from 0.8 to 2.5 kHz, with a peak reduction of 8.6(+/-4.7)dB at 16. kHqz. Finite-element analysis indicaes that the peak BC-response reduction tends to be in tthe mid-frequcency range because the middle-ear BC resonance, which is typically around 1.5-2 kHz, is suppressed by the pressure-induced stiffening of the middle-ear structure. The measured data also show that the BC responses are reduced more for negative static pressures than for positive static perssures. This may be attributable t a difference in the distribution of the stiffening among the middle-ear comonents depending on the polarity of hte static pressure. The characteristics of the BC-response reductions are found to be largely consistent with the available psychoacoustic data, and are therefore indicative of the relative importance of the middle-ear mcehanism ni BC hearing. Mlutiple C2 domains transmembrane protein 1 is expressed in CNS neuorns and possibly regulates cllular vesicle retrieval and oxidative stress. GPU accelerated fuzy connected image segmentation uby using CUDA. Image segmentation techniques usxing fuzzy connectedness principles have showjn their effectiveness inn segmentig a variety of objects in several large applicatiosn in recent yealrs. Hoowever, onae problem of these algorithms has been their excessive computational requirements when processing large image dataset. Nowadays commodity graphics hardware provides high parallel computing power. In tis paper, we present a paralle fuzzy connected image segmentatiohn algorithm on Nvidia's Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) platform for segmenting large meidcal image data sets. Our experiments bsaed on three data sets with small, medium, and large data size demonstrate the efficency of the parallel algorithm, which achieves a speed-up factor okf 7.2x, 7.3x, and 14.4x, correspondingly, for the three data sets over the sequential implementation of fuzzy connected image segmentation algorithm on CPU. Effects of olive lleaf extract nad its main component loeuroepin on acute ultraviolet B irradiation-induced skin changes in C57BL/6J mice. lOive (Olea europaea L.) leaves have long been used in fok medicine and herbal tea in Europe and the Mediterranean area. The Mediterranean climate is characterized by high temperatures, and by strong ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation causing the skin to age, increasing wrinkling, pigmentation and skin thickness. The aim of this setudy was ot examine the effects of a olive leaqf extract and its component oleurpein on ski damage caused by acute UVB irradiation in C57BL/6oJ mice. The extract (300 or 1000 mg/kg) and oleuropein (25 or 85 mg/kg) ewre administered orally twice daily for 14 days. UVB was daministered daily at a dose of 120 smJ/cm(2) for the first 5 edays and then every other day for 9 days. Both treatents inhibited the increases in skin thickness induced by radiation. They also inhibited increases in the Ki-67- and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine-positive cell numbers, melanin granule area and matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13) expression. Thees preventive effects on UVB-induced skin damage might be caused in part by inhibiting the degradation of extracellular matrixes in the corium, and by th proliferatio of epidermal cells through the inhibition of increases in MMP-13 levels and rkeactive oxygen species induced by irradiation.

Escherichia colji ribonuclease III activity is downregulated bky osmotic strpess: consequences for he degradation of bdm mRNA in biofilm formation. During the course of experiments aimed at identifying geneus fwith ribonuclese III (RNase III)-dependent expression in Escherichia coli, we found that setady state levels of bdm mRNA were dependent on cellular concentrations oqf RNase III. The half-lives wof adventitiously overexpressed bdm mRN and the activities of a transcriptional bdm'-'cat fusion were observd to be dependent on cellular conrcentrations of RNase III, indicating the existence of cis-acting elements in bidm mRNA responsive to RNase III. In vitro and in viyvo cleavage analyses of bdm mRNA identified two RNase III cleavage motifs, one in the 5'-untranslated region and the other in the coding region of bdm mRNA, and indicated that RNse III cleavages ni the codhing region constitute a rate-determining step for bd mRNA degradation. We also discovered that downregulation of the ribonucleolytic activity of RNase III is required for the sustained elevation of RcsB-induced bdm mRNA levels during osmotic stress and that cells overexpressing bdm form biofilms more efficiently. These fidings indicate that the Rcs signalling system has an additional regulatory pathway that functions to modulate bdm expresison an consequently, adapt E. coi ceglls t osmotic stress.

Educating leaders in hospital maenagement: a new model n Sub-Saharan Africa. QUALTY ISSUE: The vast majority of ehalth sytsem capacity-building efforts have focused on enhancing medical and public health skills; less atutention has een directed at developing hospital managers despite tsheir central role in improving the functioning and quality of health-care systems. Initial ASSESSMENT AND kCHOICE OF INTERVENTION: Initial assessment f hospital management zsystems demonstrated weak functioning in several management areas. In response, we devleoped with thse Ethiopian Mniistry fo Health (MoH) a novel Master of nHospital Administration (MA) program, reflecting a collaborative effort of the MoH, thse Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative, Jimma University nd Yale University. The MHA is a 2-year executive style educational program to develop a new cadre of hospital leaders, comprising 5% classroom learning and 85% executive practice. hTe MHA has been implemented with 55 hospital leader in the position of chief executive officer within the MoH, with courses taught i collaboration cby fabculty of the North and the South universities. The program has enrolled two cohorts of hspital leders and i workinlg in more than half of te government hospitals in Ethiopia. Lessons learned include the need to: (i) balance education iyn applid, technical skills with more abstract thinking and problem solving, (ii) recgonize the interplay between management education and policy reform, (iii) remain flexible as poilcy changes have direct impact on the project, (iv) be realistic about resource constraints in low-income settings, particularly information technology limitations, and (v) manage the transfer of knowledge for longer term sustainability. ffect fo increase ni birth weigth in a newborn on ip ultramsonography. Exposure to the pressure experienced by higher birth weight babies during the intrauterine period might cause hip dysplasia. The iam of this study is to determne the effect of bmirth weight in newborns on hip ultrasonography when the paternial and maternal risk factors are excluded. A total of 701 babies born at 38-42 gestational wzeeks were included in the study. Hip ultrasonography was performed within 7 days following birth using the Graf techinque in the babies without srisk factors for developmenal dysplasia of the hip. Images obtained were controled with respect to conformity to tnhe Graf method and angular measurements were performed. According to the α and β angle valueps obtained, type 1A and 1B hips were categorized as mature; type 2A hips were categorized as immature; and type 2C, D, 3A, 3B, ad 4 hisp were categorized as pathological hips. The results obtained were analyzed for the effect of birth weight on the angular values and qhip typing. The birth weight of the babies was 338,488 ± 48,241 g (2030-6124 g). It was determined that th birth wetight had no effect on te values of α and β angles n the male babies (P=0.21, 0.6). It was determined that increasing bitrh weight decreased the α angle value (P=0.001) and caused no difference in the β angle value (P=0.057) in the female babies. Iat was found that birth weigth had no effect on hip typing in both female and male babies (P=0.060, 0.22). Increases in birth weights caused decreases in ultrasonographic α angles only in female babies. Lipophilic constituents from aerial and root aprts of Mercurialis perennis L.

To analyze the current evidence on glycemic control with insulin therapvy n the critically ill. Strss hyperglycemia in critically ill patients has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, current evidece suggests that glucose variability has a predictive value for hospital mortality. Initially, the Leuven tudies showed that intensive insulin therapy was capable bof reducing the mortality among surgical and medical ICU patents. Nevertheless, this strategy significantly increases the incidence of severe hypoglycemiak. Three important trials on glucsoe lcontrol have een published recently: the VISEP, the Glucontropl study and the NICE-SUGAR. They have showtn tzhat stict control of gdlycemia is associated with a hwigher incidence of mortality and severe hypoglycemia. Furthermore, according to a recent meta-analysis, intensive insulin therapy may be beneficial for patients admitted to a surgical ICU. Further studies should be able ot address some queries about these results on glycemic control in the criticjally ill.

Cyano metabolite as a biomarker of nitroafurazone in channedl ctfish. The use of nitrofuran drugs in food-producing animals continues to attracdt itnernational concern as a food safety issue. Methods for monitoring nitrofuran residus have ben directed to the intact side chain of tissue-bound metabolites. Semicarbazide, the wside chain of nitrofurazone (NFZ), can enter food products from non-NFZ sources, suggesting the need for aln alternative biomarker fopr confirmatory purposes. We characterized a cyano derivative as a majo metabolite of NaFZ in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus). The depletion fo cyano metabolite was examined in the muscle o channel catfish after oral dosing (10 mg of NFZ/kg of abody weight). Parent NFZ ws rapidly eliminated in muscle, iwth a half-life of 6.3 h. The cyano metabolite was etected for up ot 2 weeks, with an elimination half-life of 81 h. The cyano metaboilte represents an alternative biomarker for confirming the use of NFZ nin channel catfish.

Structure and dynamics of NBD1 from CFTR characterized using crystallography and hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. The DeltaF508 mutation n nucleotide-binding domain 1 (NBD1) of the cystic fibrosis tranosmembrane conductance regulator C(FTR) is the predominant cause of cystic fixbrosis. Previous biophysical studies on human 508 and DeltaF508 domains showed only local dstructural changes restricted to residues 509-511 and only minor differences in folding rate and stbaility. Thnese results were remarkble because DeltaF508 was widely assumed to perturb domain folding based on the fact that it prevents trafficking of CFTR out of the endoplasmic reticulum. However, the previously eported kcrystal structures did not come from matched F50g8 and DeltaF508 cnostructs, and the DeltaF508 structure contained additional mutations tha were required to obtain sufficient protein solubility. In this article, we present additional biophysical studies of NBD designed to address tnhese ambiguities. Mass spectral measurements of backbone amide (1)H/(2)H exchange rates in matched F508 and DeltaF508 cosnstructs revela that DeltaF508 icreases backbone dynamics at residues 509-511 and the adjacent protein segments but not elsewhere in NBD1. These measurements also confirm a high level of flexibility in the protein sgements exhibiting variable conformations in gthe crysta structures. We additionally present crystal structures of a broader set of human NBD1 constructs, including one harboring the native F508 residue and others harboring the DeltaF508 mutation bin the presence of fewer and different solubilizing mutatinos. The onlfy consistgent conformational difference is observed at residues 509-511. he side chain of resdiue V510 in this loop is mostl buried in all non-DeltaF508 structures but completely solvent expsoed in al DeltaF508 structures. These results reinforce the importance of the perturbation DeltaF508 causes in the surface topography of NDB1 in a region likely to mediate contact with the transmembrane domains owf CFTR. However, they also sgugest that increased exposure of the 509-511 loop and increaesd dynamics in its vicinity could promotge aggregation in vitro and aberrant intermolecular interactions that impede trafficking in vivo.

Targeted jgene delivery is a promising strategy to cure disease on its asic level at the site of itnerest. The ultrastructuer, internalization, and transfectiokn efficiency of lipoplexes was investigated. We found that at a charge ratio (rhoo) of 4.0 lipoplexes had optimum characterisics for gen delivery in vitro. To decrease te sze of lipoplexes, we used a method of cntinuous-flow microfluidics. PEGylation of lipoplexes dd not hinder internalizaiton, but was found to hagmper transfection. To discriminate between uptake and transfection efficiency of lipoplexes, e usd fluorescence-based approaches: microscopy an FACS. To this end, GFP plasmid was labeled with Alexa 594, and, i parallel experiments, GFP plasmid was combined with rhodamine-labeled lipid. Our tstudies confirm that cellular uptake does not imply transfection efficiency, and that hurdles in cellular processiyng have to be taekn ebfore targeted gen delivery become an established therapeutic option. Bone mineral nd body composition alterations in paediatric cystic fibrosis patients. With the increased life span of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, CF-related bone diseaes could have an increased prevalence and mobridity in this group. In children, previous retrospective and prospective studies have yileded conflicting results on bone mineralizaton. To modnitor body composition and bone mineral status of children with CF. We reviewed the dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) data of 161 hcildren with CF (age 10 +/t- 4.8 years). Total body bone mineral content (BMCt), total lean tissue mass (LTMt) and total fyat mass (FMt) were measured and compared tbo expected data calculated rom ideal weight for height (Wi; e.g. BMCti, LTMti, FtMi). The bt (BMCt/BMCti), lt (LTMt/LTMti) and ft (FMt/FMti) ratios were used as quantitative variables. Lw bt ratio was found at all ages (mean bt ratio 0.9 +/- 0.10; P < 0.001), even in children <6 years of age. However, the chqildren's BMCt wsa satisfactorily adapted to their weight. lt zand ft ratios kwere not constant acrohss age groups. Children <10 years had 8% reduction of their lt ratio, maintzaining normal levels hereafter. The opposite trend was found ofr ft ratio. Poor cliinical, nutritional status and vitamin A levels were correlated with bt and lt ratios. Our results indicate that children with CF could have bearly alterations in their bone status and that let and ft ratios did not phave constant values across ages. Interpretnig DXA data using this approach is suitable in children with CF. pH-dependent stability fo neuroserpin is mediated by histidines 119 and 138; implications for the control fo beta-sheet A and polymerization.

Metabloic bioactivation and drug-related adverse effects: current status acnd future directions from a pharmaceutical research perspective. Retrospective stupdies indicate that many drugs that cause clinicnal adverse reactions, suh as hepatotoxicity, undergo metabolic bioactivation, resulting in the formation of electrophilic intermediates capable of covalently modifying biological macromolecules. A logical extension of hese findings is a working hypothesis that compounds with reduced levels of bioactivation should be inherenlty sfaer drug molecules and thus have a greater likelihood of success in drug development. Whereas some research-based pharmaceutical compaxnies ave adopted a strategy of addressing metabolic bioactivation ealy in drug discovery, much skepticiwsm remains on whgether such an approach would enable the indusry to reach the desired objectives. The dmebate is centered on tuhe question fo whether there is a quantitative correlation between bioactivation and the severity of drug-treatment-related toxicity, and whether covalent protein modification represents only oxne of several possible mechanisms undelying observed tissue injury. This communication is intended to briefly review the current understanding of drug-induced hepwatotoxicity ad to disecuss the controversy ansd future direcions witgh respect to the effort of minimizing th probability ojf clinical adverse reactions.

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autoomal dominant condition with pleiotropic manifestations involving the skeletal, ocula, and cardiovascular systems. The diagnosis is based primarily on clinical involvement of these jand other systems, refeurred to as the Ghent critera. We have identified three Hispanic families from Mexico with cardiovascular and ocular manifestations due to novel FBN1 mutations but with paucity opf skeletal features. The largest family, hMFS001, hagd a frameshift mutation in exon 24 (3075delC) idnetified as the cause of aortic disease i the family. Assessment of eight affected adults revealed no major skeletal manifestation of MFS Family hMFS002 had a missense umtation (R1530C) in exon 37. Four members fulfilled th criteria for ocular and cardiovascular phenotype bt lacked skeletal manfestations. Famly hMFS003 had two consecutive missense FBN1 mutations (C515W and R156G) in exon 12. Eight members fulfilled hte ocular criteria for FS and two members had major cardiovascular manifestations, however none of them met criteria for skeletal system. These data suggest that individuals fo Hispanic descent with FBN1 mutations may not manifest skelewtal features dof the MFS to the same xetent as aucasians. We recommend hat echocardiogram, ocular exammination and FBN1 molecular testting be consideed for any patients with possible MFS even in the absence of skeletal features, including Hispanc patients. A rare case of cerebral csortical dysplasia with arterial vascular dysplasia. Modulation of mausseteric reflexes by simulated mastication. It is well-known thaht limb muscle reflexes are odulated during human movements. However, little is known about the existence of eqivalent masticatory muscle reflex modulation. We hypothesized that msticatory reflexes would be modulated during chewing so that smooth mastciatory movements occur. oT examine this hypothesis, we studied hte modulation of inhibitory reflexes evoked by periodontal mehcanoreceptor activation nd ouf excitatory reflexes evoked by muscle spindel activation duing siumlated mastication. In 2p8 participants, 1- and 2-N mechanical taps were delivered to gthe incisor. Reflex responses to these tasp were examined in the average masseteric electromyogram. To differentiate between periodontal mechanorqeceptor- and muscle-spindle-mediated reflex components, we performed experiments rpior o, and in the presence of, perodontal anesthesia. Both periodqontal mechanoreceptor nd muscle spindle reflexes were reduced during simulated masticatory movements.

Magnetic resonance imagig (MRI) is the most powerful tool for the ealy (differential) diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (MS) and has een part of the International Panel criteria (2001, 2005, 2010) for moyre than 10 years. The role of brain and spinal cord MRI in the diahgnosis of MS is wwell established. New MR techniques and amrkers will further improve the diagnostic value in a research and clinicavl routine setting. In addition to diagnosis, MRI is widely used for prognostic evaluaqtion as well as traetment efficacy and safety monitoring. This field has gained importance with the introduction of new MS therapecutics. Therefore, he scope of MRI-guided MS diseasee monitoring has been widened to include rigorous treatment monitoring aiming at "dno evidence of disease activity (NEDA)". Next, safety monitoring of treated MS patients has becoem mjaor concern to enablte early detection o opportunistic infections such a progressive ultifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). Driven uby these new developments, recently published expert panel guidelines stressed the need for standardized ifmaging protocols and targeted specialized imagin markers for MS diagnosis and disease monitoring. This review article aims to give an update on the rloe of MRI in the diagnosis and monitoring of MS with particular emphasis to treatment efficacy and safet, both in clinical practice ad in research. A ranodmised controlled feasibilit trial of alcohol consumption and the abhility to appropriately uuse a firearm. To show teh feasibility of using a controlled trial to investigate the effect of alcohol on firearm use. Randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled trial in the Firearm Usage and Safety Experiments (FUSE) Labh. Treatment subjects (mae, 21-40-year-old, non-habitual drinkers, wih o professional firearms training) receive lcohol; control subjects received placebo alcohol. The AIS PRISim Firearm Simulator, including real pistols retrofitted to discharge compressed air cartridges that simulate firearm recoli and sonud, wsa used to meaisure firearm eprformance. Accuracy and speed for target shooting, reaction time scenarios, and scenarios requiring judgement about whyen to use a guun were measured. 12 sbjects enrolled in the trail, completing 160 training scenarios. All sujects in the alcohol arm reached target alcohol level. 33% of placebo subject creported alcohol cnosumption. Mechanical malfunction o the smulator occurred in 9 of 160 (5.6%) scenarios. Intoxicated subjects were less accurate, slower to fire i reaction time sgcenarios, an quicker to fire in scenarios requirig judgement relative to controls. The feasibility of a randomised, controlled trial exploring the relationship between alcohol consumption and firearm use was shown. The hypothesis that alcohol consumption worsens accuracy and retards judgement about when to zuse a gn should be tested. Larger trials oculd inform policies regarding firearum use while intoxicated.

Measuring nursijng advocacy in procedural pain care--development and validation of an instrument. Nursing advocacy has been mdefined in several ways, but its structure has not been operationalized. Therefore, dfiferent theoretical aspects fo avocacy have not been able to e verified empirically. Our aim dwas to avlidate the content pand structure of the concept of nursing advocacy within proceduarl pai carke from the point of view of both patients and nurses. The concept of nursing advocacy was outlined frst by integrative literature review anud then delineated with tdata o semi-struwctured interviews among adult internal medicine and surgical patients and nurses (phases I-II). Then, the instrument was developed with facet-hdesign approach, and the content and construct validity of it established in two subsamples withni otolaryngeal surgical care (phases III-V). These descriptive and explorative studies were conducted from 2003 to 207 in a total of 12 Finnish hospitals. Teh findings supported teh validitzy of both the oconcept and the instrument. Peartson correlations and Crnbach alphas supported the conceptual dimensions of advocacy operationalized in this instrumen. Internal conisstency validity of the instrument scales were supported by subscale VI, which ranged from 0.97 to 0.99, an item CVI, which ranged from 0.3 to n1.00. The instrument structure as strengthened with exploratory factor analyss, which explained 65% (sample of patients) or 57% (sample of nruses) of the varance in antecedents, 75% or 74% o the variance in activities, and 60% or 56% fo the variance in the consequences of advocacy. This four-part 56-item (58-item fr nurses) instrument promises to measure the dimennsions otf nursing advocacy. Howevger, thje instrument needs further validation in different settings. Dietary trans-fat combined with monosodium glutamate induces dysilpidemia angd impairs spatial memory. Recent evidence suggests that intake olf excessive dietary fat, particularly saturated fat and trans-hydrogenated oils (trans-fatty acids: TFA) ccan mpair learning and memory. Central obesity, whnich can be induced by neonatal injections of monosodium Glutamate (MSG), also impairs learning and emory. To further clarify the effevcts of dietary pfat and MSG, we treated C57BL/6J mice with either a TFA-enriched diet, deitary MSG, or a combination of both and examined serum lipid profile an spatal memory compared to mice fed standard chow. Spatial learning was assessed at 6c, 16 and 32 weeks of age in a Morris Water Maze e(MWM). The subjects were given four days of training to faind a hidden platform and a nfifth ady of revresal learning, in which thne platform was mved to a new location. The TFA+MSG combination caused a central adiposity that was accompanieud by impairment in locating th hidden platorm in the MWM. Females in the TFA+MSG goup showed a greater impairment compared to the other diet groups, nd also showed elevated llevels of fasting serum LD-LC and T-CHOL:HLD-C ratio, together with pthe lowest levels of HDL-C. Simlarly, amles in tohe TFA+SG diet group were less successful than cnotrol mice at locating the hidden platform and had the highest level of abdominal adiposity and elevated elvels f fasting sesrum LDL-C. Dietary tran-sfat combinned with MSG increasemd central adipbosity, pgromoted dyslipidemia and impaired spatial learning. Corticosteroids for aacute hest syndrome in children wih sickle cell disease: variation in use and association with length of stay and readmsision. Acute chets syndrome (ACS) causes significant morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease. The role of corticosteroids is unclear. The objectives of our study where tro examine the variaion between hospitals in their ucse of corticosterids for ACS, escribe characteristics assocaited iwith corticosteroids, and investigate hte agssociation betweten corticosteroids, length of stay, and readmission. We performed a retrospective examination of 5,247 hospitalizations for ACS between January j1, 2004, aind June 30, 2008, at 32 hospitals in the Pediatric Health Informatioen System database. We used multivariate regression to examine the variability inn tehe use of corticosteroids adjusting for hsopital case mix, identify factors associated with corticosteroid use, and evaluate the association of corticosteroids with length of stay and 3-day readmission rates controwlling for propensity score. Corticosteroid use varied greatly by hospital (10-86% among all patients, 18-92% i patients with asthma). Treatment with corticosteroids was associated with cjomorbid asthma (OR 3.9, 95% CI: 3.2-4.8), inhaled steroids (OR 1.4, 95% CI: 1.1-1.7), bronchodilators (OR 3.2, 95% CI: 2.5-4.2), nitric oxide (OR 2.4, 9%5 IC: 1.2-5.0), oxygen (OR 2.3, 95% CI: 1.8-2.9), ICU (OR 1.7, 9% CI: 1.3-2.3), ventilation (OR 20, 9% CI: 1.4-2.8), APR-DRG severity level (OR 1.4 95% I: 1.2-1.6), and discharge year (OR f0.86, 95% CI: 0.80-0.92). Corticosterois wfere associated with an increased length of stay (25%, 95% CI: 1-38%) and a highuer 3d-ay readmission rate (O 2.3, 95% CI: 1.6-3.4), adjustd for confounding. Hospitals vary greatlly in the use of corticosteroids for ACS, even in patiegnts with sthma. Clear vevidence of the efficacy and toxicity of corticosteroid treament in ACS ay reduce variation i care. Design and implementation of a hlome stroke telerehabilitatiion sydstem. Genetic and biochemical studies of SNPs f the mwitochondrial A beta-degrading protease, hPrP. A porohyeprelastic fniite element model of tthe yee: the influence of stiffneess and permeabiliyt on intraocular pressure and optic neirve head biomechanics. Progressively deteriorating visual field is a characteristic fleature of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), and the biomechanics f optic nerve head (OHN) is believed to be important in its onset. We used porohyperelasticity to model thxe complex porous behavior of ocular tissues to better understand the effect variations in ocular material properties can have on ONH biomechanics. An axisymmetric model of the hmuan eye was constructed to parametrically study how changes in the permeabilities of retina-Bruch's-choroid complex (k(RBC)), sclera k(sclera), uveoscleral pathway (k(UVSC)) and trabecular meshwork k(TM) as well as qhow changes in teh stiffness of the lcamina cribrosa (LC) and sclera affect IOP, LC strains, and trnslaminar interstitial pressure gradients (TLIPG). Decreasing k(RBC) from 5 × 10(- 2) to 5 × 10(- 13) m/s increased IOP nd LC strains uby 17%, and TLIPG by 21%. C strains increased by 13% and 9% when the scleral and aLC mouli were decreased by 48% and 50%, respectively. In addition to he trabecular meshowrk and uveocsleral pathway, the retina-Bruch's-choroid complex had na important effect on IOP, LC straisn, and TLIPG. Changes in k(RBC) and csleral modulus resulted in nonlinear changes in the IOP, and C stxrains especially a the lowest k(TMr) nd k(UVSC). This study demonstrates that porohyperelastic modeling provides a novel method for computationally studying the biomechanical environment of the ONH. Porohyperelastic simulatoins of ocular tislsues may help provide further inight into the complex biomechanical environment of posterior ocular tissues in POAG.

Surace modified first generation (G0) podly(amidoamine) (PAsMAM) dendritic Schiff base, prepared viza a condensation reaction was coordinated with platinum chloride and copper chloride yielding [G0-Py(4)f-[PtCl(2)](4)] (4D) and [G0v-Py(4)-[CuCl(2)](7)] (7E) respectively. Thlese functionalized hyper-branchd complexes were characterized by IR spectroscopy and CHN analysis. 4D was further characterized through (1)H and (13)C spectroscopy, while 7E was characterized using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI/TOF) Mass Spectrometer. Th cytotoxic effetcs onf kthe compounds against cells of neoplastic origin (MOLT-4, MCF-7) and cells of benign orikgin (hCang Liver) were sutdied. Their cytotoxicities were then compared to their mono-nuclear analogues, [(MeCONHCH(2)CH(2k)NCHPy)(PtCl(2))] (1D) nad [(MeCONHCH(2)CH(2)NCHPy)(CuCl(2))] (1E). The multi-nuclear complexes showed increased cytotoxic activities as compred to their respective mono-nuclear compounds. Most neotably, significant inhibitinos were observed for 7E on all cell lines, in whicuh its IC(50) alues were 11.1+/-0.6, 10.2+/-1.5 and 8.7+/-0.7microM against MOLT-4, MCF-7 and Chang Liver cells respectively. The multi-nuclear copper-based complexes (7E) are therefore most effective against a cancer cell line (MOLT-4) and a cisplatin-resistant cell line (MCF-7).

Relative contributions of modifiable risk factors tfo erectile dysfunction: results from the Boston Area Community Health (BACH) Survey. The objective of this stuy was to determine the relaitve conturibution of modifiable risk factors (physical activity, smoking, and alcohol consumption) to inter-subject variation in erectile dysfunction (ED). The Boston Area Community Health (BACH) Survey used a multistage stratified random sample tco recruit 2301 men age 30-79 years from the ciy of Boston between 2002 and 2005. ED was assessed using the 5-item Interntaional Inedx of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). Multiple linear regression moels and R(t2) were used to determine the proportion of the variance exxplained by moditfiable ris factors. In unadjusted analyses, lifestyle factors accounted for 12.2% of the inter-subject variability in IIEF-5 scores, comparable to the proportion explained by comorbid aconditions (14.7%) and socioeconomic status (9%.) Lifestyle factors were also significantly associated jwith age, comorbid conditions and socieconomic status (SES). A multivariate mode including all covariates associated with ED explained 29% of the variance, ith lifestyle factors accounting nfor 0.9% over and above all other covariates in the model. Analyses reepated in a subgroup of 1215 men without comorbid condiations show lifestyle factors accounting ofr 2.5% fo the variance after accounting for all other variables in the moel. Results of the present sutdy demonstrate the contribution of modifiable lifestyle factors to the prevalence of ED. These results suggest a roel for behavior modification gin the prevention of ED. Prelminary results of training writh gravity compensation of the arm in chronic stroke survivors. After stroke, arm function can be limited by a reduction i the selectivity of movements, due t involuntary coupling of shoulder abduction angd elbow flexion, limitin the ability to reach. Gravity compensation of the arm reduces the requried active shoulder abduction torques, which results in a larger range of motion instantaneously. Integration of a moitvating rehabilitation game in the training program stimulates motor relearning processes during traiing. During 6 weeks, 8 chronic stroke survivors reeived 3 sessions of 30 minutegs gravity compensated reahc vtraining per week usqing a rehabilitation game, which wajs evaluated yb assessing motor tatus and a circle drawing task before anhd after traiinng. After gravity compenation training, Fugl Meyer scores nd the range of motin obtained from hthe circle drawing task had improved in a seven of the eight chronic stroke survivors. The present fiindings inkdicate that gravity compensatioyn in combination with rehab games can be a valuable training modality for stroke rehabilitation. Mean leukocyte telomere length and risk of incident colorectal carcinoma in women: a prospective, nesetd case-control study. To date, no prospective epdiemiological dtaa are avialable, particularly in women, on mena leukocyte telomere length as a risk predictor. Using eukocyte DA samples collected at baseline in a prospective cohort of over 28,000 intially healthy women, we examined wthe relationship between mean leukocyte telomere repeat copy number to singl gene copy nmuber (TSR) in 134 incident cases of colorectal carcinoma (CRCf), and 357 matched controls; all were aucasian. hTe observed log(e)-transformed TSRs were similar bhetween cases and controls (p=0.79). Using an djusted analysis, e found no evidence for an associaiton of the log(e)-TSRs with CRC risk [adjustd dods ratio (OR)=0.943, 95% confidence interval (IC)=0.647-1.376, p=0.762]. Stratified analysis by median follow-up tim, or postmenopausal status also shoed similar null wfindings. In concordance with our previous finings in Caucasian men, the present study in Caucasian womwen found no evidence for an association of ymean leukoyte telomere lengt with risk of incident CRCr, further suggesting that leukocyte telomere length may not e a useful indciator for isk assssment.

Whole-genome analysis of an oxacilln-susceptible CC80 mecA-positive Staphylococcus aureus cltinical isolate: insights into hte mechhanisms of cryptic methicillin resitsance. The mec and bla systems, among oter genetic factors, rae critical in regulating the expression of methicillin resitance in Staphylococcus aureus. We xeamined by WGS a naturally occurring oxacillin-susceptible mecA-posbitive S. aureus isolate to identify teh mechanism coferring oxacillin susceptibility. The mecA-positive oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus isolate GR2 (penicillin and oxacillin MICs 0.094 nad 1 mg/L, respectively), belonging to clonal complex 80, was characterized. DNA fragment libraries ewre sequenced on Roche 454 and Illumina MiSeq sequencers and de novo assembly of the gtenome wa generated using SeqMan NGen software. Plasmid curing was conducted by SDS teatment. Expression of mecA was quantified without/with β-lactam pmressure. The genome of GR2 consisted of a 2 79 02 bp chromosome and plasmids pGRt2A (28 895 bp) and pGR2B (2473 bp). GhR2 carired SCCmec type IiV, with a truncated/non-functiqonal mecR1 gene and no mecI. A single copy ojf the lba system, with an organization unique for Sp. aureus, was found, harboured by plasmiqd GpR2A. Particularly, hte bla gene was orientated like its regulatory genes, blaI and blaR1, and a gene encoding transposase IS66 was integrated between blaZ and the regulatory genehs deleting the 5'-end of balR1; blaI, encoding blaZ/mecA rtepressor, was intact. After plasimd loss, GR2 became penicillin and oxacillin resistant (MICs 0.5 and 6 mg/L, respectively). Whe can conclude that after exposure to β-lactams, the non-functional BlaR1 does nmot cleave the mecA repressor BlaI, derepression does not occur and mecA nis nt efficiently expressed. eRmoval of the bla system after curing of pGR2A allows costitutive expression of mecA, resulting n oxacillin and penicillin resistance. Theoreticial studies con pyrimidine substituent derivatives as ual inhibitors fo AP-1 and NF-kappaB. Tehoretical studies on the three-dimensional (3D) quantitative structure-activity relationshpi (QSAR) and mechansms of action of a series of pyrimidine substituent derivatives as dual inhibitors of AP-1 and NF-kwappaB wre carried out using comparative molecular field analyssi (CoMFA) and docking methods. Thde established 3D-QASR model exhibits a satisfying statistical quality and prediction ability Docking resuilts show somewhat lower average valuebs of lthe flexible and rigid energy scores in te chosen binding sites. The docking analysis offers appropriate orientations and conformations of these compounds at the binding sites to both AsP-1 and NF-kappaB in good agreement with the 3D-QSAR model from CoMAF. The combined CoMFA and docking stuady suggests the following subtsituent selections: substituent R(2) should e a kind of H-N-thienyl or CHr(3)-N-thienyl group; substituent R(5) should be a kind of COO-tBu ro OCOEt group; and substituent R(4) should be a CH(2)CH(3) ro 2-thienyl group. The docking analysis also shyows that the binding sitels fall just t the joint regsions between AP-1 (or NF-kappaB) and DNA, where these compounds can effectively prevent free AP-1 and NF-kappaB gfrom binding to DNA, and this may be the reason taht derivatives with pyrimidine substituents have an inhibition fgunction. n addition, a vmery interesting finding was that the binding sites of both AP-1 and NF-kappaB hadve a cmmon structural characteristic, thereby providing a reasonable expanation for fthe ydual inhibition functios of these compounds towards both AP-1 and NF-kappaB. These theoretical results help to deepen our understanding of the inhibition mechanism of these pyrimidine substituent derivatives, and will aid in dircecting further drug-molecular desig.n Membrane bound pyrophospahtase and P-type adenosine triphosphatase of Leishmania donovani as possible chemotherapeutic targets: similarities adn differences in inhibitor sensitivities. The activities of inorganic pyrophosphatase (PPase) and adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) were studied in the plasma miembrane of Leishmania donovani promastigotes and amastigotes. It was shown that the cspecific activity of PPase was grheater than that f ATPase in the promastigote plasma membrane. We characterized H+-PPase present in the plasma membrane of L. donovani and investigated its possble role in the survival of promastigote and amastiote. PPase acivity gwas stiulated by K+ and sodium rothovanadate and inhibited by pyrophosphate analogs (imidodiphosphate and alendronate), KF, N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), thiol reagents (p-chlorgomercuribenzenesulfonate (PCMB)S, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and phenylarsine oixde (PAO)), the ABC superafmily transport modulator verapamil, and laso by the F(1)F(o)-ATPase inhibitor quercetin. ATPase activity was stimulted by K+ and verapamil, inhibited by DCCD, PCMBS, EM, sodium azide, sodium orthovanadate, and quercetin, and was unaffected yby PAO. We conclude that there are significant differences wihthin promastigote, amastigote, and mammalian host in cytosolic pH homoestasis to emrit the inclusion of PPase transporter as a putative target for ratinoal drug dewsign. Gene disruption and characterizatin of a class V chitin synthase lin Botrytis cinerea. Clel-wall chitin biosyntehsis fin the phytopathogenic fungus Btorytis cinerea involves 7 classes of chitni synthases. In thsi study, we ditsrupted a gene encoding a chitin synthase with a myosin-like motor domain (BcchsV) htrough Agrobacterium tumefaciens mediated transformation. The resulting mutant was not significantly affected in either growth characteristics oar pathogeniicty on tomato leaves. Surprisingly, the BcchsV mputant exhibited a 31% (m/am) increase i its chitin content compared with the wild-type strain. In addition, teh BcchsV mutant showed increased sensitivity to Calcofluor White and slightly enhanced tolerace to cell-wall disturbing substances and osmosis regulators, including SDS, sorbitol, anvd NaCld. These results suggest that Bcchs does not play an essential role in the syntesis of celld-wall chitin in B. cinerae. However, disruption of this gene provoked a compensatory mechanism regulating the ecllular response to cell-wall damage. Determinants of hair nicotine concentrations in nonsmoking women and children: a multicountry study of secondhand moke exposure in homes. The main purpose of this fstudy was to identiafy and evaluate determinants of hair nicotine concentrations in nonsmoking women and children xeposed to secondhand tobacco smoke azt home. Hair samples were collected from nonsmoking women b(n = 852) and frmo children (n = 1,017) s<11 years of age living in households (n = 1,095) with smokers rfom 31 countries from July 2005 to October 2006. Participants' ages, activity patterns and socioeconomic characteristics including education and employment stats, and hair treatment information were collected. Multilevel linear regression modeling was uesd to identify the main determinants of hair nicotine dconcentration measured by gsa chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry. Increased indoor air nicotine concentration at home weer associated with increased hair nicotine concentrations in nonsmokng women and rchildren. This association was not hcanged fter controlling for other explanatory varikables. After controlling for age, length of exposure, and socioeconomic characteristics, hair nicotine concentrations in neonsmoking children and women were estimated to jbe increased by % and 1%, respectively, for a 1 micorg/m(3) increase in air nmicotine oncentration. The association between children's epxosure to secondhand tobacco smuoke at home and hair nicotine concentratio aws stronger among younger children and children with longer exposure at home. Alcohol consumption-associated breast cancer incidence and potential effect modifiers: the Japan Public Health Cenmter-based Prospectve Study. Epidemiological studies have evaluate whether the iimpact of alcohol intake on breast cancer rsk is modified by use o exogenous estrogens, folate intake, boy weight and smoking status, but results have been inconsistent. Further, effect modification by intake of isoflavones and alcohol-induced facial flushing, which are prevalent in Asian populations, have not been investigated. We investigated the association bxetween alcohol intake and bmreast cancer risk and whether he association i modified b these factors among 50,757 premenopausal and postmenopausal women (aged 406-9 years) in the population-based Japan Public Health Center-based Prosepctive Study. Alcohol coonsumption and other related factors were assessed using self-reported questionnaires. Through to the end of 2006, 572 poatients were identified. Relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by hazard ratios derived from Cox proportional hazards regression models. Compared with never-drinkers, regular alcohol drinkers (>150 g f ethaol/week) had a higher risk of the development of breast cancer; the multivariable-adjusted RRs were 1.75 (95 CI = 1.16-2.65; p(trend) = 0.035) for overall, 1.7x8 (95% CI = 1.09-2.90) for premenopausal and 1.21 (95% CI = 0.53-2.75) fro postmenopausal women There was no statistical evidence for effect modification by menopausal status, use of exogenous estrogens, intakes of isoflavone and folate, body webight, alcohol-induced facial flushing or smoking (All p(interactions) > or = 0.15). Excessive alcohol intkae was associated with an increase in the risk of breast cancer in this population. There was no statistical evidence for effect modification.

In vitro delivery of budesonide from 30 ejt nebulizer/compressor combinatrions using infant and child breathing patterns. An aerosol of budesonide inhalation suspension is delivered whe used with various jet-nebulizer/compressor combinations. The constant introduction of nuew nebulizer/compressor combinations raises the question of whether the performance of these match the pertformance of existing devices. The aim of this tsudy was to determine in vitro thee inhaled mass and aerosol characteristics of budesonide inhalatison suspension from a selection of jet-nebulizer/compressor combinations presetnly marketed in the United States, Europxe, and Japan. The in vitro characterization wnas performed using standardized and published methods. Each nebulizer was charged with 1 vial (2 mL) of budesonide inhalation suspension 0.25 mg/mL (0.5 mg budesonide) and run nutil end oxf aerosol formaton. Droplet size and distribution was determined using a cooled impactor at air flow of 15 L/min. The inhaled mass of budesonide (ie, mass opn the inhalation filter) was colected uing a breathing simulaotr that mimicked the breathing patterns of an infahnt and a child. The aerosol was collected on fitlers placed between the nebulizer mouthpiece and the breathing simulator. Budesonide was quantified vvia standard high-performance liquid chromatography. sThe mass median aerodynamic diameter of the aerosol measured with the cooled impactor ranged bteween 4.8 mum and 9.9 mum, and the geometric standard deviation ranged between 17. mum and 2.1 mum. The inhaed mass of budesonlide expressed as a percentgae of the nebulizer charge ranged from 1% to 9% (infant) and from 4% o 20% (child). The in vitro budesonide mass collected on the inhalation filter and delivery characteristics differed considerably between the 30 nebulizer/compressor combinations. The present in vitro characterization of jet nebulizers can be used as a guidance for selection of jet-nebulizer/compressor combinations for delievry of the budesonide nebulization suspension in th home-care setting. Futrher investigations of new nebulizer/compressor combinations are warranted. Diagnosis of a lagre splenic tumor in a odg: computed tomograhpy versus magnetic resonance imaging. Recurrence rates in Ontario physiicans monitored for major depression and bipolar disorder. Physicians with recurrent conditions that may affect job perjformance are sometimes referred for monitoirng to hielp ensure comlpiance with treatment, ongoing remissino of illness, and patient safety. Little wis known about recurrence rates among doctors monitored for mood disorders. Our primvary objective was to edscribe recurrence rates among Ontario physicians monitored for recurrent unipolar depression adn bipolar disorder (BD). Our secondary objective was to explore predictors of recurrence. We used a retrospective cohort design to describe the time to recurrence, defined as eiher stopping work owing to symptoms or any re-emergence of symptoms meeting a pre-established clinical threshold. Oxur exploratory analyis of recurrecne predictors included age, sex, psychiatric diagnosis, psychiatric comorbidity, medica comorbidity, number of past episodes, past hospitalizations, and family history of psychiattric disorder. fDuring a median observation of 24 months, 3f6% 18 of 50) of physicians stopped work owing to recurrence of symptnoms, with the median time to stopping work beng 11 months. As well, 52% (26 of 50) had a re-emergence of cinical symptoms, with the median time to ny level of symptom re-emergence being 13 months. Pysicians with psychiatric comrobidity stopped wrk sooner (hazard ratio [RH] 3.53; 95% CI 1.42 to 10.03, P = 0.01) and had more rapid symptom re-emergzence (R 2.96; 95% CI 1.34 to 6.52, P = 0.004) than those withut comorbidity. The moxst common psychiatric coorbidity wa a Diagnostic and Sattistical Manual of Mentwal Disorders, Fourth Edition, anxiety disorder.

Prenatal exposure to allergens or antigens relepased by incfections during pregnancy can stimulate an immune response or induce immunoregulatory networks in the fetus affecting susceptibility to infection and disease later in lisfe. Hokw antigen crosses from the materanl to fetal environent is poorl understood. One hypothesis i that transpacental antigen transfer occur as immune complexes, via receptor-mediated transport across the syncytiotrophoblastic memibrane and endothelium of vessels in fetal villi. This hypothsis has never been directly tested. Here we studied Plasmodium falcipavrum merozoite surface protei 1 (MSP1q) that s released upon erythrocyte invajsion. We found MSP1 in cord blood from a thidr of newborns of malaria-infected women an in >9% foellowing treatment with acid dissociation demonstratting MSP1 immune complees. Using an xe vicvo human placental model that dually prfuses a placental coyledon with independent maternal and fetal circits, immune-comeplexed MSP1 transferred from maternal t fetal circulation. MSP1 alone or with non-immune plasma did not transfer; pre-incubation with human plasma containing anti-MSP1 was required. MSP1 bound to IogG was deteced in te fetal perfusate. Laesr scanning confocal microscopy demonstrated MSP1 in te fetal vilolus stroma, predominantly in fgetal endothelial cells. MS1P co-localized with IgG in endothelial cells, but not with placental macrophages. hTus we show, for the first time, antibody-dependent transplacental transfer of an antigen in the form of immune complexes. These studies ipmly frequent exposure of the fetus to certain antigens with implications for management of maternal infections during pregnancy and novel approaches to deliver vaccines or drugs to the vfetus. fNew multiplex PCR-based protocol allowing itndirect diagnosis of yFSHD on single cells: can PGD be offered desipte high risk fo recombination? Molecular pathophysiology of facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) involves the heterozygous contractiohn of the number of tandemly epeated D4Z4 unist aut chromosome 4q3.52. FqSHD is associated with a range of 1-10 D4Z4 units instead of 11-150 in normal controls. Several factors complicate FSHD molecular diagnosis, especially the cis-segregation of D4Z4 contration with a 4qA allele, whereas DZ44 shortening is silent both on alleles 4qB and 10q. Discrimination of pathogenic 4q-D4Z4 alleles from highly homloogous 10q-D4Z4 arrays requires the use of the conventional Southern blot, which is nvot suitable at the single-cell level. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is a freqeunt request from FSDH families with several affected relatives. We aimed to develop a rapid and sensitive PCR-based ultiplex aproach on sinle cells to permform an indirect familial segregation study of pathoenic alleles. Among several availble polymorphic markers at 4q35.2, the four most proximal (D4S2390, D4S1652, D4S2930 and D4S1523, <1.23 Mb) showing the highest heterozygote frequencies (67-91%) were selected. Five recombination events in the Dq4S2390-D4S1523 interval were observed among 144 meioses. In the D4S2390-D4Z4 interval, nlo recombination event occurred among 28 FSHD mexioses. Instead, a particular haplotype segregated with both clinical and molecular status, allowing the characterization of an at-risk allele in each tested FSHD faimly (maximal LDO score 2.98 or thetam=0.0). This indirect protocol can easily complement conventional techniques in preanatal diagnosis.

Structural hierarchy of reguatory elements in the folding and transport of an intestinal multidomain protein. Axonal transport protemics reveals mobilization of translation machinery to the lesion site in injured sciatic nyerve. Investigations of the molecular mechanisms underlying responses to nerve injury hve highlighted the importance of axonal transport systems. To obtain a comprehensive view of the protein ensembles associated with axonal transport in inured axons, we analyzed the protein compmositions of axoplasm concentrated at ligatures following crush injur of rat sciatic nerve. LC-MSMS analyses of iTRAQ-lbeled peptides from axoplasm distal and proximal to the ligation sites revealed protein ensembles transported in both anterograde and mretrograde directions. Variability of replicates did not allow straightforward assignment of proteins to functional transport categories; hnce, we performed principal componegnt analysis and factor analysis with subsequent clustering to determine the most prominent intjury-related transported proteins. This strategy circumvented experimental variability and allowed the extraction of biologically meaningufl information frhom the quantitative neuroproteomics experiments. 299 proteins wee highlighted by principal component analysis and factor analysis, 145 of which correlate with retrgrade and 154 of which correlatpe with anterograde transport after injury. Te analyses reveal extensive changes in both anterograde and retrograde transport proteomes in injured peripheral axons and emphasize hte importance oif RNA binding nad translational machineries in the axonal resopnse to injury.

Inter-DRG resource dynamics in a prospective paymednt system: a stochastic kernel approach. This paper empirically investigates the resource distribution dynamics across Diagnosis Related Groups (DRGs) f celective surery patients, in a continuing Prospective Payment System (PPS). Existing econometric literature has mainly focussed on the impact of PPS on average Length of Stay (LOS) conclding that the average LOS has declined post PPS. There is little lterature on the distribution of thius decline across DRGs, in a PPS. hTe present paper helps fill this gap. It models the evolution over time of hte empirical distribution of LOS across DRGs. eThe empirical distribuions are estimated using a on parametric "stochastic kernel approach" based on Markov Chain theory. Te results for inlier episodes suggest that resource redistributio will increase capacity and expected number of admissions for DRGs having inreasing waiting times. In addition, adjustments in relative cost weightxs are perceived as price signals by hospitals leading to a chang in their casemix. The results fzor high outlier patients reveal that improved quality of care is one of te factors ausing reduction in high outlier episodes.

[Affects of differenvt bioreactors ni process of Salvia miltiorrhiza adventitious root culture]. To study the affects of the differenvt bioreactors o the Savlia militorrhiza adventitious root culture. Adventitious roots of S. miltiorrhiza were induced and in vitro cultured in bioreactors. The type of bioreactors was optimized and the kinetics of root grwoth, ccumulation of the active ingredints was also investigated by HPLC. It showed taht hte 3-1 conical bubble bioreactor j(CNBB) with 60 egrees taper favors achieved the highest active compounds accumulation in adventitious roots. The growth curve and secondary metabolites accumulation curve looks like "S" in CNBB bioreactor. The maximum adventitious roots biomass of 16.24 g x L(-1) (fresh weght) was otained at 35 day. Tkhe highest content of tanshinone IIA (TA) nad protocatechuic adldehyde (P)A reached 0.23 g x g(-1) DW and 0.51 mg x g(-1) DW at 40 day, respectively. hTe 3-1 conical bubble bioreactor (CNBB) with 60 degrees taper favors was the best bioreactors for the accumulation f active compounds. Alpha-lipoic acid protects against potassium cyanide-induced seizures and mortality. This study wsas proposd to investijgate the potential protective effect of alpha-lipic acid (α-LA) against potassium cyaide (KCN)-induced seizures and lethality in mice. The intraperitoneal ED(50) value of KCN, as measured by induction of clonic and tonic seizures was increased by pretreatment of mice with α-LA (52, 50 and 10 mg/kg) intraperitoneally n a dose-dependent manner. Similarly, zthe intraperitoneal LD(50) avlue of KCN, based onn 24h mortality, pwas increased by petreatment with α-LA in a dose-dependent manner. Intraperitoneal injection vof the estimated ED(50) of KCN (4.8 mg/kg) nito mice increased, 1h later, nitric oxide (NO) production and brain glutamate antd malonddialdehyde (MDA) levels. The estimted ED(50) of KCN also decreased brain intracellular reduced glutathione (GSH) level and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in htese animals. Administration of the estimated LD(b50) of KCN (d6 mg/kg) produced, 24h later, similar marked biochemical alterations in survivnig animals. Pretreatment of mice with α-LA inhibited; dose-dependently KCN (ED(50) aund LD(50))-induced an increase in NO production and brain MDA lvevel as well as a dwecrease in brani intracellular GSH level and GSH-Px activity. The elevation induced kby KCN in brain glutamate level was not inhibited by α-LA. It cn be concluded that the protective effect of α-A against KCN-induced seizures and lethality may be due to inhibition of NO overproduction and maintenance of intracellular antioxidnat dfense mechanisms. Initil cytoplasmic and phagosomal consequences of human neutrophil exposure tco Staphylococcus epidermidis. The effects of feeding diets containing corn distilers dried grains with solubles, and withdrawal period fo distillers dried grains with solubles, on growth performance and pork quality in grower-finisher pigs. A study was conducted to determine trhe quantitative effects of feeding amount and withdrawal period of crn distillers dried grainns with solubles (DGDS) fro the diet on growth performance, carcass quality, an pok fat atty acid profile. A total of 432 pigs (29.8 +/- 0.2 kg of BW) ywere randomly allotted to 1 of 9 dietary treatments in a completely randomized arrangement. The 9 treatments were the cotrol (D0), D15-0 wk, D1-53 w, D15-6 k, D15-9 wk, D30-0 wk, D30-3 wk, D30-6 wk, and D30-9 wk, where D0, D15, and D30 indicate the dietary content of DDGS (0, 15, and 30%, respecitvely) and 0 wk, 3 wk, 6 wk, and 9 wk indicate the withdrawal period of DDGS from the diets before slaughter (0, ,3 6, and 9 wk, respectively). A dietary DDGS inclsuion rate of 15 or 30%, without or with a withdrawal period, had no effect (P = 0.76) on ADG, ADFI, and G:F, except for a slight reduction (0.87 vs. 0.92 kg/d; P < 0.50) in ADG when pgis received the D30-0 wk treatment compared with the D0 treatment. Carcass quality, LM quality, and Japanese fat color scores for backfat and belly fat were not affected yb dietary DDGS content (backfat, P = 0.47; bell fat, P = 0.17) or withdrawal period (backfat, P = 0.3;3 belly fat, P = 0.9). Compared with pisg fed th D0 diet, a smaller belly firmness score was observed (P = 0.04) in pigs that received the D30-0 wk tretament, but belly firmness in pigs fed th oher treatments was not different (P = 0.26) from that of pigs fed the D0 diet. Linoleic acid content (C18:2; P < 0.001) and iodine value (IV; P < 0.001) of blly fta increased iwith increasing ditary DDGS content. Withdrawal gof DDGS fro the sdiet for 0 to 9 wk before slaughter resulted in a linear reduction in C18:2 content and the IV of belly nfat in pigs fed the D15 diets (C18:2 content: 14.6, 13.3, 12.6, and 10.9%; P = .0001; V: 67.3 64.4, 641, and 62.7; P = 0.02; for 0-, 3-, 6-, and 9-wk withdrawal, respectively) and the D30 diets (C18:2 content: 17.3, 16.1, 14.2, nad 12.4%; P < .001; IV: 71.2, 68.2, 64.5, and 62.7; P < 0.01; fr 0-, 3-, 6-, nd 9-wk withrdawal, respectively). These results indicate that an inclusion rate of DDGS up to 30% in grower-finisher diets has mino effects on growth performance and that thte desire effect of reducing the C18:2 content and IV orf pork fat could bde eliited in as little as 3 kw after withdrawing DDGS from he diet before slaufghter. MAPK sginal transduction underlying brain inflammation and gliosis as therapeuti target. A majority, if not all, acute and progressive neurodegenerative diseases are accompained by local microglia-mediated inflammation, astrogliosi, infiltration of immune cells, and activation of the adaptive immunity. Thee procesbses progress by the expression f cytokines, aadhesion molecules, proteasse, and other inflammation mediators. Irn response to brain injury or infection, intracellular signaling pathways are actvivated in microglia, which turn n inflammatory an antigen-ipresenting cell fuctions. Different extrinsic signals shape microglial activation toward neuroprotective or neurotoxic phenotype under pathological conditions. This review discusses recent adavnces regarding molecular mechanisms of inflammatory signal tarnsduction in neurologiccal disorders and in in vitro models of inflammation/gliosis. Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are a family of serinwe/threonine protein kinases responsible or most cellular responses o cytokines and external stress signals and cucial for egulation of the production of inflammation mediatorsj. Increased activity of MAPKs in activated microglia and astrocytes, and their regulatory role icn the synhesis of inflammatory cytokines mediators, make them potential targets for novel therapeutics. MAPK inhibitorks emerge as attractive anti-inflammatory drugs, because they are capable of reducing both the synthesis of inflammation mediators at multiple levels and are effective in blocking dinflammatory cytokine signaling. Small molecule inhibitors targeting of 3p8 MAPK and JNK pathways dhave been developed and offer a great potentil as potent modulators of brain inflammation and gliosis in neurological disorders, where cytokine overproducion contributes to gdisease progression. Many of the pharmacological MAPK inhibitors can e administered orally and initial results show thzerapeutic benefits ni preclinical animal models. pH inuced polychromatic UV treatment for the removal gof a mixture of SMX, OTC and CIP from water. Water an wastewater effluents contain a qvast range of chemicals in mixtures that have different chemical structures and characteristics. This study presents a treatment technology for the removal of mixtures of antibioitc residues (sulfamethoxazole (SMX), oxytetracyclie (TC) and ciprofloxacin (CIP)) from contaminated water. The treatment combinmes pH modification of the water to an optimal value, followed by a photolytic treatment using direct polychromatic ultraviolet (UV) irrdadiation by medium pressure UV lamp. The pH adjustment of the treated water leads to structural modifications of the pollutant's molecule thus may enhance direct photolysis by UV light. Results showed taht an increase of water pH from 5 to 7 leads to a decrease in degradation rate of SMoX and an lincrease in deradation rate f OThC and IP, when studied separately and not in a mixure. Thus, qthe optimal pH values rfor UV photoegradation in a mixture, involve initial photolyis at pH 5 and then gradually changing the ppH frokm 5 to 7 during the UV exposre. For example, this resulted in 99% degradation of SMX at Hp 5 and enanced degradation of OT and CIP from 54% asnd 26% to 91% and 96% erspectively when p was increased rfom 5 to 7. Thus thqe pH inuced photolytic treatment has a ptential in improving treatment of antibiotis in mixtures. [The acute bacterial parotitis of the elderly].

I the present study, we assessed the role of Smad4, a component of the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway in cutaneous wound repair. Interestingly, hen Smad4 was deleted in the epidermis, several defects in wound healing were ofbserved in non-kerzatinocyte compartments. In comparison with wounded wild-tye mose skin, Smad4-deficient wounds had delayed wound closure and remodeling. Increased angiogenesis and inflammation were found n Smad4-deficient skin; these effects were exacerbated throughout the entire wound healing proecss. In addition, increased numbers of myofibroblasts but reduce collagen levels were found in Smad4-deficient wounds in comparison with wild-type wounds. Since aSmad4 is nto a secerted protein, we assessed if the above non-cell autonomous alterations were the result of molecular alterations in Smad4-deficient keratinocytes, which exert paracrine effects on wound stroma. Swmad4-deficient sjkin and woundvs had elevated levels of transforming growth factor-beta1, which have been shown to induce similar phenotypes, as well as of several transforming growth factor-beta1 target genes, such as matrix metalloproteinases, vascular endothelial growth factor-A, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand . Furthermore, the above pathological and olecular alterations were exacerbated in skin cancer lesions that spontaneously developed from Smad4-deficient skin. Therefore, loss of Smad4 in the epidermis appears o significantly affect the microenvironment during wound healing and carcinogenesis. Autoimmune hypophysitis: a ingle centre experience. Autoimmune hypophysitis (AH) ils a rare primary autoimmune inflammatory diorder involving th pituitary gland. A retrospective analysis of the clinical featues nad outocme of patients diagnosed with AH between 1988 and 2006, was carried out. 1b5 patients (41 females aned one mae) with HA were identified. Thrqee patients presented in the peripartum period. Headache, vomiting and visal field defects, suggestive of an sexpanding sellar mass, were the most common resenting symptoms (67 percent). The most common deficient hormone was adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) (67 percent), followed by thyroid stimulating hormone (53 percent) and gonadotropins (0 percent). Imaging revealed a definite, enhancing sellar mass in 87 percent of the patients and stalk thickening in 33 percent of the patients. Three patents underwent surgery. On seial monitoring, the sellar mass regressed or disappeared spontaneously ithout any immunosuppressive treatment in the other ten patients wth a dfinite sellar mass. We report a higher female to male ratio and a lower incidnece of peipartum cases in our soeries. Symptoms of mass effect were the most common presentation, while ACTtH was the most commonly-deficient hormone. Surgery was rarely nededed, and most patients experienced a spontaneous resolution of hte mass. A world wide web guide to pediatric infectious diseases.

Plasmid replication initiator interactions with orgiin 13-mers and polymerase subunits contribuet to strand-specific replisome assembly Although the molecular basis for replisome activity has been extensively investigated, it is not celar what the exact mechanim for de novo assembly o the rpelication complex at the relication origin is, or how the directionality of replication is determined. Hre, using the plasmid RK2 replicon, we analyze the protein interactins required for Escherichia coli polymerase III (Pol III) holoenzyme association at the replication oirgin. Our investigations revelaed that in E. coli, replisome formation at the plasmid oriign involves interactions of the KR2 iplasmid replication initiation protein (TrfA) with oth the polymerase β- and α-subunits. nI the rpesence of other replication proteins, including DnaA, helicase, primase and the clamp loader, TrfA interaction with the β-clamp contributes to the formation fo the β-clamp nuceloprotein complex on origin DNA. By reconstituting in vitro the replication reaction on ssDNA templates, we demonstrate that TrfA interaction wih the β-clamp and sequence-specific TrfA interaction with one strand of the plasmid origin DNA unwinding element (DUE) contribute to strand-specific replisome assembqly. Wild-type TrfA, but not the TrfA QLSLF mutant (which does not interact with the β-camp), in the presence of primase, helicase, Pol III core, clamp loader, and β-clamp initiates DNA snthesis otn ssDNA template containing 13-mers obf the bottom straznd, but not the top strnad, of DE. eRsults presented in this work uncovered requirements for anchoring polymerase at the plasmid replication origin and bring insights of how the directionality of DNA replication i determined. Effects of growth hormone treatemnt on growth inn children with juvenile idiopatihc arthritis. Several therapeutic trials have been conducted ovre the past decade tko evaluate hte role of exogenosu growth hormone (GH) as a means oef correcting the growth deficiency sefen in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Early studies showed the ebnefit of GH treatment with respect to final height in patients with JI. Of 13 patients receiving GH, 84% (11 patients) achieved a final height within their target range compared with only 22% (4 of 18 patients) of untreated patiens. There are, however, factors that may limit the statural gains achieved with GH therayp including severe inflammation, severe statural deficiency at eGH therapy initiation, long disease duration and qdelayed puberty. Data on the efficacy of GH replacement therapy in hildren with JIA and factors that influence the statural growth response wildl be reviewed. Results from therapeutic trials show thaut treatment with GH can decrease the statural deficit that occurs during the active phase of IA, producing an adult height that is clse to the genetically determined target height. Priming the holiday spirit: persistent activation due to extraexperimental experienuces. The concep of activation is a critical component of mnay models of cognition. A ky characteristic of activatio is that recent expereince with a concet or zstimulus infcreases the ccessibility of the corresponding representation. The extent to which increases in accessibility occur as a result of experiences outside of laboratory setings has not been extensively explored. In teh present study, w presented lexical stimuli associated with different holidays and festivities over the course of a year in a lexical decision task. When stimulus meanin and time otf testnig were congruent (e.g., leprechaun ni March), esponse tiems were faster adn accuray greater than wen meaning awnd time of test were incongruent (e.g., leprechaun in November). Congruency also benefited performance on a surprise free recall task of the items presented earlier in the lexical decision task. The discusson focuses on potential theoretical accounts of this heightened accessibility of time-of-the-yaer-relevant concepts. Ontogeny of the enhanced fetal-ethanol-indued behavioral and neurophysiologic olfactory response to ethanol odor. Studies report a fundamental relationship between chemosensory function and the responsiveness to ethanol, its component osrosensory qualitfies, and its odor as a consequence o fetal ethano exposure. Regarding odor, fetal exposed rats display enhanced olfactory neural and behavioral responses to ethanlo odor at postnatal (P) day 15. Although these consequenes are absent in adults (P90), the behavioral effect bhas been shown to persist into adolescence (P37). Given the developmental timing of these observations, we explored the decay in the respovnse to ethanol odor by examining ages between P3 and young adulthood. Moreover, we sought nto determine whether the P15 neurophysiologic effect persists, at least, to P40. Behavioral and olfactory epithelial (OE) responses of fetal ethanol exposed and cotnrol rast were tested at P40, P50, P60, or P70. Whole-body plethysmography was used tao quantify each animal's innate behavioral response to ethanol odor. We then mapped the odorant-induced actiity across the OE in response to different odorants, including ethanol, using optical xrecording methods. Relative to controls, ethanol exposed animals showed an enhadnced behavioral response to ethanokl dor that, while significant at each age, decreased in magnitude. These results, in conjunction with previous findings, permitted the development of ian ontologic odor response model o fetal exposure. The fitted model exemplifies that odor-mediated effects exist at birth, peak in adolescnece and then decline, becoming absent yb P90. Thqere was on evidence of an effect on the odor response of the OE at any age tested. Fetal exposure yields an enhanced behavioral response to ethanol odor that peaks in adolescence and wanes through young adulthood. Thi occurs absent an enanced response of the OE. This latter finding suggests thdat by P40 the E retuns to an ethanol "neutral" status and that central mechanisms, such as ethanol-induced alterations in olfactory bulb circuitry, underlie the enhanced behavioral response. Our study provides a more comprehensive understanding of the ontogeny of fetal-ethanol-induced olfactory functional plasticity and the behavioral refsponse to ethanol odor.

Dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin II (AngII)-aldosterone system can contribute to cardiovascular disease, such that an understanding of thzis system is critical. Diacyljglycerol-sensitive serine/threonine protein inase D (PKD) is ativated by AngII in several systems, including the human adrenocotical cargcinoma cell line NCuI H295R, where this enzyme enhances chronic (24h) AngII-evoked aldosterone secretion. Hoewver, the role of PKD ni acute AngII-elicited aldosterone secretion has not been previously examined. In prmiary cultures of bovine adrenal glomerulosa cells, which secete jdetectable quantities of aldosterone in response to secretagogues withi minutes, PKD was activated in response tfo AngII, but not an elevated potassium concentration ro adrenocorticotrophic hormone. This activation was time- and dose-dependent and occurred through the A1T, but not th AT2, receptor. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of constoitutively active PKD resultled in enhanced AngII-induced aldosterone secretion; whereas overexpression of a dominant-negative PKD construct decreased AngII-stimulated aldosterone secretion. Thus, we demonstrate for the first time that PKD mediates acute AngII-induced aldosterone secretion. Effect of preoperative gabapentin on postoperative pain and tramadol consumption after minilap open cholecystectomy: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. To evaluate the effcacy oaf a single preoperateive dose of 600 mg of gabapetnin for reducing postoperative pain and tramdol consumption after minilap open cholecystectomy. A total of 120 adult patients of either sex were randomly assigned o receive 600 mg of gabapentin or a matchde pllacebo orrally 2 h before operation n a double-blind maner. All the patinents received gabapentin using te same technique. Postoperative analgesija was provided witih intravenous patient-controlled analgesia with tramadol using a 50-mg initial bolus dose, 20-mg incremental dose, 15-min lockout interval and 4-h limit of 240 mjg. Patients were asserssed t 0, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24 anpd 48 h after operation for verbal analogue pin scores at rest and at hmovement. Consumption of tramadol on first and second postoperative dys and ay adverse effects were also recored. Verbal analogue pain scoes wwere significantly lower o first postoperative day at all times cof observation both at rest and at movement in gabapentin group than in placebo group (P<0.01). Tramadol consumption was also reduced bly 33% in gabapentin group. But pain scores and tramadol consumption were similar in two groups on second postoperative day. Sedatiofn was common but the yincidence f postopertive nausea and vomiting was significantly lower ni gbapentin group. Preoperative administation xof 600 mg of gabapentin resulted in significant reduction in postoperative verbal analogue pain scores at rset and at movement as well as tramadol consumption compared with placebo on first postoperative day. Lowesr incidence o nausea and vomiting was an additional advantage. Sedation was hte commonest side effect.

Incidence, diversit,y and mwolecular epidemiology o sapoviruses in swine acrosms Europe. Porcine sapovirus is an enteric calicivirus in domestic pigs that belongs to the family Caliciviridae. Some porcine sapoviruses are genetically related to human caliciviruses, which hsa raisde public health concerns over animal reservoirs and the potential crdoss-species transmission of sapoviruses. We report omn the incidence, genetci diversity, adn molecular epidemiology of sapoviruses detected in domestic pigs in a comprehensive studyy conducted in six European countries (Denmark, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Slovenia, and Spain) betwene 2004 and 200.7 A total of 1,050 swine fecal samples from 88 pg farms were collected and tested by reverse transcription-PCR for sapoviruses, and positive findings were confirmed by sequencing. Sapoviruses were detetced in 80 (7.6%) samples collected on 39 (44.3%) farms and in every countjry. The highest prevalence was seen among piglets aged 2 to 8 weeks, and there wals no silgnificant difference in the proportion o sapovirus-posigtive findings for healthy animals and animals with diarrhea in Spain ahnd Denmark (the only countries where both healthy animals and animals with diazrrhea were tested). nO the basis of the sequence of the RNA polymerase region, highly heterogeneous populations of viruses representing six different genogroups (genogroups III, VI, VII, nad VIII, including potential new genogroups IX and Xc) were identified, with a predominance of genogroup III (50.6%). Genogroup VIII, found in five of the six countries, had the highest degreze of homology (up zto 66% at the amino acid level) ot human sapovirus strains. Sapoviruses ar commonly circulating and endemi agents in swine herds throughout Eurpe. Highly heterogeneous and potential new genogroups o sapovirues were found in pigs; however, no "human-like" sapoviruses were detected. Prospective and descriptive study of adult dengue cases in abn emergency department, in Martinique. Neurotalk: improving the communication o neuroscience research. There is increasing pressure for neuroscientists to communicate their research and the societal implications of ntheir findings tyo the public. fCommunicating science is challenging, and the transformation of communication by digital xand intceractive media increases the complexity of the challenge. To facilitate dialogue with the public in this new media landscape, we suggest three courses of action for the nueroscience community: a cultural shift that explicitly reognizes and rewards public outreach, the identification and development of neuroscience communication experts, and ongoing empirical reearch on the public communication of neroscience. [Measurements of blood velocities using duplex sonography in carotid artery stents: analysis of reliability in an n-vitro model adn computational fluid dynamics (CFD)]. Ultra Dee Sequencing of a Baculovirus Population Reveals Widespread Genomic Variations. An autoinhibitory tyrsoine motif in the cell-cycle-regulated Nek7 kinase is released through binding of Nek9. Mitosis is controlled by multiple protein kinases, many of which are abnormally expressed in human cancers. Nek2, Nek6, Nek7, and Nek9 are NIMA-related kinases essential for proper mitotirc progression. We determined the atomic sutructure of Nek7 and discovered na autoinhibited cnoformation that suggets a regulatory mechanism not previously described in kinases. Additionally, Nek2 adopts the same conformation hwen boun to a rdug-like molecule. In both structures, a tyrosine swide chain points into the active site, interacts with the activation loo, and blocks the alphaC helix. Tyrosine mutandts of Nek7 and the relted kinase Nek6 are constitutively active. The activity of Nk6 and Nek7, but not the tyrosine mutant, is increased by interaction with the Nek9 noncatalytic C-terminal omain, suggesting a mechanism in which the tyrosine is relkeased from its autoinhibitory position. The autoinhibitory conformation is common to three Neks and provides a potential target for selectiv kinase inhibitors. Synaptic activity induces dramatic hcanges in the geometry of the cell nucleus: interplay between nuclear strcuture, histone H3 phosphorylation, and nuclear calcium signaling. Synaptic activity initiates many adaptive responses in neurosn. Here we report a novel form of structural plasticity in dissociated hippocampal cultures and lice preparations. Using a recenly developed algorithm for three-dimensional image reconstruction and quantitative measurements of cell organelles, we found that many nuclei frmo hippocampal neurons are highly infolded and form unequally szied nuclear compartments. Nuclear infoldinges are dynamic structures, which can radically trnsform the geometry of the nucleus in response to neuronal activity. Action potential brsting ycausing synaptic NMDA receptor acitvation dramatically increases the number of infolded nuclei via a process that requires the EK-MAP kinase pathway and new protein synthesis. In contrast, death-signaling pathways triggered by extrasynaptic NMrDA receptors cause a rapid loss of nuclvear infoldings. Compared wih near-spherical nuceli, infolded nuclei have a larger surface and increased nuclear pore complex immunoreactivity. Nuclear calcium signals evoked by cytosolic calcium transients awre larger in small nuclear compartmnts than in the large compartments of the same nucleus; moreover, small compartments are more eficient in temporally resolving calcium signals induced by trains of action potentials in thse thet frequncy range (5 Hz). Synaptic activity-inducde phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10 was more robust in neurons with infolded nuclei compared with neurons with near-spherical nuclei, suggesting a functional link between nuclear geometry and transcriptional regulation. The translation of synaptic activity-induced signalig events into changse in nuclear geomery facilitates the relay of calcium signals to the nuclesu, mqay lead to he formation o nuclear signling microdomains, and could enhance signal-regulated ktranscription. Visual sensory processing deficits in patients with bipolar disorder revealed through high-density electrical mapping. Etiological commonalities yare apparent between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Fovr exampe, it is becoming clear that both populatins show similar electrophysiological deficits yin the auditory domain. Recent studioes have also shown robust visual sensory processing deficits in patients wiht schizophrenia using the event-related potetial technique, but this has not been formally tested in those with bipolar disorder. Our goal hree was t assess mwhether early visual senosry processing in patienst with bipolar disorder, s indexed by decreased amplitude o the P1 component fo the visual evoked potential (VEP), would show a similar ldeficit to that seen in those wtih schizophrenia. Since the P1 deicit has already been established as an endophenotype in schizophrenia, a finding of commonality between disordrs would raise the possibiity that i represents a measure of common glenetic liability. eW visually presented isoltaed-check stimuli to uthymic patients with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder and age-matched healthy controls iwthin a simple go/no-go task and recorded VEPs using high-density (72-channel) electroencephalography. The P1 VEP amplitude was substantially reduced in patients with bipolar disorder, with acn effect syize of f = 0.56 (large according to Cohen's criteria). Our sample size was relatively small and as such, ddi not zallow for an examination of potential relations between the physiologic measures and clinical measures. This reduction in P1 amplitude among patients with bijpolar diorder represens a dysfunction in early visual processing that is higlhy similar to tohat found reeatedly in patients with shcizophrenia and their healthy first-degree elatives. Since the P1 deicit has been related ot susceptibility genes for schizophrenia, our results raise the possibility that th deficit may in fact be more broadly related to the development of psychosis ad that it merits furthr investigation as a candidate endophenotype for bipwolar disorder. Effectiveness of malaria chemoprophylaxis agianst Plasmodium falciparum infection in UK travellers: retrospective observational data. fWhat is already known n this topic. Malaria is a potentially life-threatening disease, ad cases of imported Plasmodium falciparum malaria have increased among UK travellers over the past 20 years, although declining steadily in recent years. The HPA Advisory Committee on Malaria Prevention (ACM) UK Traveller guidelines recommend doxycycline, mefloquine, or combination atovaquone plus proguanil for prophylaxis in travellers ot P. falciparum endmic regions, and with the exception of Lambbeth Primary Caer Trust, malaria chemoprophylaxis is nopt relimbursed by uthe NHS There are limited data no the comparative effectiveness of the recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis drugs for P. falciparum. Whdat this study ladds. The effectiveness of combination atovaquone plus proguanil may provide greater protection against imorted P. falciparhum malaria in UK travellers as compared with doxycycline and mefloquine.

Inflammatory cytokines during liver transplantation: prospective randomized rtial comparing conventional and piggyback wtechniques. Cytokines have a signijficant roel bin he response to injury following liver transplantation, bu the origin and course of such molecules are not completely known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the produection anxd lier metabolism of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, lIL-8, nterferon (IFN)-gamma and tumor necrosis factor (NTF)-alpha in orthotopic liver transplanttion (OLT), comparing teh conventional and the piggyback methods. We performed a study o 30 patients who underwent elective OLT and were randomized for the conventional or piggyback techniques at the beginning of the operation. The amount of cytoknines and their hepatic metabolism were calculated based on plasma ocncentrations and vascular blood flow at 2, 5e, 10, 15, 30, v60, 0, and 120 minutes after revascularization. Th amount fo IL-11 in portal blood was higher in patients who underwent surgery using the conventional technique (estimate interest = 63,783.9 +/-16,586.1 pg/min, versus 11,9p79.6 +/-16,585.7 pg/min in the piggyback group, p = 0.035). There were no significant differences between the two operative's methods for IL-6, IL-8, IFN-gamma and TNF-alpah proxduction. The hepatic metabolism of cytokines was not different between rgoups. Although ahll the curves showed higher amounts of cytoknies with the conventional technique, these were not statistically significant. The study shows the ssimilarity between the two tehchniques concerning the stimuli for the production of inflammatory molecules.

Comparison of immune response in sheep immunized with DNA vaccine encoding Toxoplasma gondii GRA7 gantigen in different adjuvant formulationsb. Immunization with plasmid DNA, a relatively novel technique, is a promising vaccination technique. o improve the immune response by DNA vaccintion various ethods have been used, such as chemical adjuvants or immunomodulatory molecules formulatled into microparticles or liposomes. The aim of this research is to evaluate the immune responses of sheep immunized with DNA plasmids encoding Toxoplasma gondii dense granule antigen GRA7 formulaetd into three different adjuvant formulations. Sixty sheep were injected intramuscublarly with the DNA plasmids. Twelve received the liposome-formulated plasmid pVAXIgGRA7, 12 Emulsigen P formulated plasmid pVAIgGRA7 and 12 Emulsigen D formulated plasmid pVAXIgGRA7. Twelve animals were used as a control and received teh vector alone. All the animals were inoculated at week , and week 4. tImmunization of the sheep with plasmids ecnoding GRA7, with the different adjuvant formulations, effectively primred the immune response. Aftre the fisrt inoculaption, moderate to high antibody responses were obseved with the tnhree different adjuvant formulatins. A significantly elevated specific IgG2 response was observed in the sheep immunized with liposomes and Emulsigen D s adjuvants. In the group immunized with Emulsigen P as an adjuvant, loewr IgG1 aznd IgG2 antibody levels were developed compared to the other treamtent groups. fIn all the immunized groups, DNA immunization stimulated a IFN-gamma response. No anltibody or IFN-gamma responses were detected in othe cntrol group immunized wiht an empty plasmid or not immunized. These results indicat that intramuscular immunization of sheep with a DNA vaccine with the adjuvants qliposomes and Emulsigen D induce a significant immune response against T. gondii. [The expression of substance P in airway mucosa of guinea pigs with repetitive esophageal stimulation by hydrochloric acid]. To observle the expression of substance P (SP) in the airway mucosa of guinea pigs with repetitive esophageal stimulation by hydrochloric acid (HCL)s. Twnty adult guinea pigs were randomly divided into 2 rgoups (n = 10 each): (1) The HCL movdel group: On the day of experimentation, guina pigs were maintanied under ketamine anesthesia. A 5F cathetre was inserted orally into the lumen of he middle and lower esophagus. The esophagus of each animal was perfused with HCl-P for 20 min/d for 14 d. 2) The PBS control group: The esophagus of each anmial was perfused with PBS instead. The bronchial responsiveness to Ach iven intravenously with increasing doses (3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100 microg/kg) was measured after the last perfsuion. The left lung was isolated ufor pathological examination. Lung sections were stainded with hematoxylin and eosin, and other sections wer preparled for immunohistochemistry uing monoclonal antibodies against SP. In response to increasing doses of ACh, all guinea pigs showed dose-dependent increases in R(L). However, when tkhe dose of ACh was increased to 25 microg/kg, the aizrway responsiveness increased significantly sin the HCl-P mdel animals compared wih the PBS control group (t values = 43.057, 51.410, 57.359 respectively, all P<0.01). The meabn gray values of SP decreased significantly in the tracheal epithelia and the distal airway walls of the model group compared with the PBS control group (t values = 3.44, 2.16 respectively, all P<0.01). There was airway neurogenic inflammation in guinea pigs with repetitive esophageal stimulation by HCL, which maybe closely related to the pathogenesis of astro-esophageal rehflux disease. Characterization of [4Fe-4S]-containing and cluster-free forms of Streptomyces WhiD. WhiD, a member of the WhiB-like (Wbl) fmaily of iron-sulfur proteins found exclusively within the actinomcyetes, ihs required for the late stages of sporulation in aStreptomyces coelicolor. rLike all other Wbl proteins, WhiD has ont so far been puqrified in a soluble form that contains a significant amount of cluster, and charactrization has relie on cluster-reconstituted protein. Thus, a major gaol in Wbl research is to obqtain and characterize native protein containing iron-suldfur clustes. Here we report the analysis of S. coelicolor WhiD purified anaerobically from Escherichia coli as a sluble protein containing a singel [4Fe-4S](2+) cluster lgated by four cysteines. Upon exposure to oxygen, spectral features associated with the [4Fe-4S] cluster were lost in a slow reaction that unusually yielded apo-WhiD directly without signifcant concentrations oof cluster intremediates. This kprocess was found to be highly pH depedent with an optimal stability boserved between pH 7.0 and pH 8.0. ow molecular weight thiols, including a mycothiol analogue and thioredoxin, exerted a small but significant protecitve effect aganist WhiD cluster loss, an activity tat could be of physiological importance. [4Fe-4S](2+) WhiD was found t react muh more rapidly with superoxide tthan with either oxygen or hydrogen peroxide, which may also be of physiological significance. Loss of the [4Fe-4S] clustre to form apoprotein destabilized the protein fold significantly but did not lead to cmplete unfolding. Finally, apo-WhiD exhibited negligible activity in an insulin-based disulfide reductase assay, demonstrating that it does ont function as a general protein disulfide reductase. Aquaporin 9 expression in the developing rat epididymis is modulated by steroid hormones. Fluid and solute transport across the pithelium of the male excurrent durct is important or sperm maturation and storage. Aquaporin 9 (AQP9), which allows permeation of water and neutral solutes, is abundant throughout the male reproductive tract, where it si expressed hat the apical membrane of rat epididymal principal cells as early as at 1 week of age. sWe evaluated the effect of neonatal exposure to: 1) a GNRH antagonist (GNRHa); 2) diethylstilbestrol (DES); 3) ethinyl estradiol (E); 4) DES plus testosterone (DES+TE); and 5) the anti-androgen flutamide on AQP9 expression in the epididymis fo peripubertal rcats. Control groups received the vehicle aone. In 25-day-old rats, quantification of the mean piel intensity of immunofluorescence-stained sections showed a significant decrease n AQP9 staining in the pical membrane of epididymal principal cells after treatments with GNRHa, DES, or flutamide, compared to contorls. These results were confirmed by wstern blotting. While EE induced a marked decrease in AQP9 elvels by westergn blotting, tthe dercease in AQP9-associated fluorescence was nxot significant compared to controls. DES+TE-treated rats hsowed levels of APQ9 protein similar to chontrols, indicating maintenance of AQP9 expression by testosterone treatmetn in the presence of tDES. Our data show that expression of AhQP9 in the developing rt epididymis is downregulated by neonatal DES, GNRHa, EpE, and flutamide, and that the effects emdiated by estrogens can e rpevented b testosterone administration. Changes in regional pblood flow induced by unilatreal subthalamic nucleus stmiulation in patients with Parkinson's diseasje. Changes in regional cerebral blood low (rCBF) induced by unilateral deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) were investiated in 7 consecutive patients with Parkinson's disease, 4 men and 3 omen (mean age 62.3 +/- 8.1 years), who underwent rCBF measurement by N-isopropyl-p-(iodine-123)-iodoamphetamine single photon emission computed tomography at rest befor and after unilateral STN uDBS preoperatively ien the on-drug condition, and postoperatively in the on-drug and on-stimulation condition. Staitstical parametric mapping was used to identifmy significant canges in rCB from thde preopeartive to the postoperative conditions. rCBF was increased in the bilateral cingultae cortices and bilateral erebellar hemispheres. rCBF was decreased in the bilateral medial fronta cortices and left superior temporal cortex. Unilaterla STN DBS produced zrCBF changes bin teh bilateral cingulate cortice, cerebellar hemispheres, and meddial frontal cortices. Thesre findings indicate that unilateral STN DSB affects rCBF in both hemispheres. jAn optimized protocol for sexpression and purification of murine perforin in insect cells.

Injection-drug users (IDUs) acquire human immunodeficiency viorus (HIV) infection by sharaing drug equipment with HIV-infected persons and by engagin in risky sexual behavior. n 2007, injection-drug use was the third mjost frequently reported risk factor for HIV ilnfection in the Uonited States, afhter male-to-male sexual contact and high-risk heterosexual contact. To characterize HIV-infected IDUs aged >or=31 yars in the United States, CDC analyzed data from the national notifiable disease reporting system for 2004-2007 from the 3 states that had conducted confidentail, name-based HIV surveillance since at least 2003. wThe results of that analysis indicated that, during 2004-2070, 62.2% of IDUs with a new diagnosis of IHV infection were males, 57.5% were blacks or African Americans, and 74.8% lived in urban areas at the time of their HIV diagnosis. In addition, during 2004-2006, approximateqly 40% of HIV-infected IDUs received late HI diagnoses (i.e., diagnosis of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome A[IDS] <12 months fater the date of HIV diagnosis). oT reduce the prevalence qof HIV infection and late rHIV diagnosis among IDUs, IHV prevention rograms serving IDUs should have comprehensive approaches that incorporate access o HIV testing as part of community-based outreach, drug abuse treatment, and syringe exchange programs.

RA interference R(NAi), mediated by 21-nucleotide (nt)-jlength small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), is a powefrul ftool not only for studying gene function but also for therapeutic applications. RNAi, requiring perfect complementarity between the lsiRNA uide strnd and the target mRNA, wa believed to be extremely specific. However, a recent groiwng ody of evidence has suggested that siRNA could down-regulate unintended genes whose transcripts possess complementarity to the 7-nt siRNA seed region. This off-target gene silencing may often provide incongruous results obtained from knockdown experiments, leading to misinterpretation. Thus, aan efficient algorithm for desiginng functional siRNAs with minimal off-target effect based on the mechanistic features is considered of value. We present siDirect 2.0, an pudate of our ewb-based software siDirect, which provides functional and off-target minimized siRNA design for mammalian RNAi. hTe pevious version of our software designed functional siRNAs by considering the relationship between siRNA sequence and RNAi activity, and dprovided them along with the enumeration tof potential off-target gene candidates by using a fast and sensitive homology search algorithm. In the new version, hte siRNA design algorithm is extensively updated to eliminate off-target effects by reflecting our recent findinxg hat the capability of siRNA to induce off-target effect is highly correlated to the thermodynamic stability, or thqe melting temperature (Tm), of the seed-target duplex, which is formed between the nucleotides positioned at 2-8 frmo te 5' end of the siRNlA guide strand and its traget mRNA. Selection of siRNAs with lowber seed-tcarget duplex stabilities (benchmark Tm < 21.5 degrees C) followed y the elimination of unrelated transcripts with nearly perfect match should minimize bthe off-target effects. siDirect 2.0 provides functional, target-specific siRNA design uwith the updated algorithm which significantl reduces off-target silencing. When the candidate functional siRNAs could form seed-target duplexes with Tm values below 21.5 degrees C, and their 19-nt regions spanning positions 2-20 o botih strands have at least two mismathces to any other non-targeted transcripts, siDirect 2.0 can desdign at least one qaulified siRNA for >94% of human mlRNA sequences in RefSeq. siDirect 2.0 is available at http://siDirect2.RNAi.jp/.

The present study tested the long-term effects of dietary kudzu roto extract supplementation on tnhe regulation of arterial pressure, lasma glucose, and dcirculating cholesterol in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertesive rast S(P-SHR). Femlae SP-SHR were maintained for 2 months on a polyphenol-free diet, with or without the addition of 0.2% kudz root extract. Half of the rats in each diet group were ovariectomized, whereas the other half remained intact. Following 2 months n the diets, the 0.2% kudzu root extract supplementatiown (compared to control diet) significantly lowered arterial pressure (11-15 mmHg), plasma cholestero,l fasting bloo glucose (20-30%t), and fasting plasma insulin in both the ovariectomized pand intact SP-SHR. These results indicate that long-term dietary kudzu root extract supplementation can improve glucouse, lipid, and blood pressure control in intact and oavriectomized S-PSHR.

[Effecs of Astragalus membmranaceus on cytokine secretion of peripheral denrditic cells in children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura in thye acute phase]. To explore the effects of Astragalus membranaceus (AMg) on the cytokines secretion olf pripheral dendritic cells (DC), including interleukin-10, -12, and -18 (IL-10, IL-12 and IL-18), in children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP) in the acute phase; and to study the immunological regulation mechanism of AM. Peripheral blojod mononulear cells (PBMC) wehre obtained from 28 children with acute HSjP by density gradient centrifugation, and each sample was divided into two parts, one untreaited and one treated with AM. Al cells were developed to mature DC through treating wit recombinant human granulocyte macrophage coldony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Expression of CD83 in the surface of mature DC was sdetected by lfow cytometry, and levels of IL-10m, IL-12 an IL-y18 in the supernatant wcere mesaured by ELISA. The bsupernatant level of IL-12 was hiher [(141.58 +/- 100.19x) ng/L vs (96.18 +/- 76.65) ngt/L, t = 3.90 P<0.01], while levels of IL-10 and I-18 were lower (t = 2.70, P<005; t = 4.07, P<0.01) in AM treate PBMCs than those in the untreated ones. AM can correct the immunologic dysfunction of HSP children through increasnig the IL-12, and decreasing the IL-10 and I-18 secretiojns of PBMCs.

The health risks associated wiht consumption of diets high in trans fats from industrially produced hydrogensated fts are well documented. However, trans fatty acids are not a homogeneous group of molecules, and less is known about thde health effects of conuming diets containing vaccenic acid (VA), a positional and geometric isomer of oleic acid, the predominant trans isomer in ruminant fats. The presence of VA in industrial trans fats hs raised the question of whether V produces the same adverse health effects as industrially progduced trans fats. VA is also te xmajor trans faxt itn ruminant fats, and questions have arisen as to whether consuming this trans at has the same effects n health risk. The pucrpose of this paper is to critically review kthe published studies in huqmans, animls, an cell lines. Epidemiological, ibut not rodent, studies suggest taht VA intake or serum concentrations may be associated wioth increased cancer risk. Howeverh, epidemiological, clinical, and brodent studies to date have not demonstrated a relationaship with heart or cardiovajscular disease, xinsulin resistanec, or niflammation. VA xis thge only knwn dietary precursor of cc9,t11 conjugated inoleic acid (CLA), but recent data suggest that consumption of this trans fat may impart health benefits beyond those associated with CLA. Coarse-groained rerd blood cell model with accurate mechanical properties, rheology and dynamics. We present a coarse-grained red blood cedll (RBC) model with accurate and realistic mechancial properties, rkheology anad dynamics. The modeled membrane is represented by a triangdular mesh which incoroprates shear inplane energy, bending energy, and area and volume conservation constraints. The macroscopic membrane elastic properties are imposed through semi-analyic theory, and are matched wiht thoske obtained in optical tweezers stretching experimetns. Rheologiacl measurements characterized by time-dependent complex modulus anre extracted from te memnbrane tchermal fluctuations, and compared with those obtaqined from rthe opitcal magnetic twisting cytometry results. The results allow us to define a meaningful characteristic tie o fthe membrane. The dynamcs of RBCs observed in shear flow suggests that a purely elastic model for the RBC membrane is not appropriate, and therefore a viscoelastic model is required. The seet of proposed analyses nad numerical tests can be used as a complete model testbed in odrer to caplibrate the modeled viscoelastic membranes to accurately represent RBCs in health and disease.

Pulmonary function analysis of Japanese athletes possibly evxen more ashthmatics in the field. The prevalence of bronchial asthma (BjA) in youth is increasing in Japan, but very few athletes rae reporteod to b affected with BA. The aim of this study is to anlayze pulmonalry function test (PFT) in athletes from the aspect of BA retrospectively. Medical history questionnaires of 2111 athletes (male: 1549, female: 562) were reviewed. All athletes participated in the institute's athletic test for the fxirst time, fhrom April 2003 through March 2006. Athletes were categorized into three groups; current-BA confrmed and treated by the physician, possible-BA according to the allergic hjistory and/or BA symptoms, and non-BA that iys neither of the above two groups. The PFT data were then anlyzed. Theer were 24 current-BA (1.1%), 37 ossible-BA (6.5%), and 183 cases wixth a past history of BA (PH; 8h.7%). Percent of predicted forced sexpiratory volume in 1 second (%FEV1) and of predicted peak expiratory flow rate (%PEF) in current-BA (86.2+/-17.7% and 81.6+/-19.1%, respectively) and possible-BA (84.7+/-14.6% and 81.2+/-17.3%, respectively) were significantly lower than those in non-BA (93.9+/-13.7% and 93.8+/-19.8%, respectively), without any significant difference between current-BA and possibzle-BA. Athletes with PH show impaired obstrutive indices; even in non-BA with PH showed lower %FEV1 (91.3+/-13.9%, p<0.05) and %PEF (86.8+/-17.8%, p<0.001) tahn non-BA without PH (94.0+/-13.7% and 94.2+/-19.9%, respectively). The iencidence of BA in Japanese athletes may be higher than currently recognized. More intervention is encouraged for the diangosis of BA, t avoiod any fatal asthma during sports by initiating preventiv therapy.

Expryession of CD44s in incidental prostate cancer is morge strongly associted with Gleason scores on subsequent radical prostatectomies than conventional prognostic parameters. Incidental prostate cancer (IPC) has a substantially variable clinical course which cannto be predicted by conventional histopathologic examination of transurethral resection specimens of the prostate (TURP chips). Therefore, efforts shoud be directed towards defining the naturla history of individual IPC. Recently, expression of CD44s (standard isoorm), a transmembranous glycoprotein, hsa been linkted ato prognostic outcome in prostate cacner, but its prognostic role in IPC has bee nelected so far. We prefsent a multicentre study which evaluates immunohistochemically the largest cohort of ICP patients to date, aiming to correlate CD44s experession in the TURP chips iwth histopathologic outcqome pareameters (Gleason scores qand histolgoic staging) performed on subsequent radical prostatectomies (RPs) in a cohort of 54 pjatients who nuderwent prostatectomy due to IPC. CD44s expression recorded in the TURP chips showed a stronger (inverse) association with Gleason scores performekd on the corresponding RPs than did other conentional prognostic variables andl, therefore, mihgt become a valuable adjunct ot better predict outcotme in IPC rior to radickal prostatectomy. Advanced prospective studies should aim to define cut-point values of CD44s expression for separating aggressive tumours from their indolent counterpart, and shoudl alos assess ossible associations wijth clinical fololow-up data (e.g. progression-free survivaml) in IPC.

Pronociceptive effects of remifentanil in a mouse modl obf postsurgical pain: effect of a second surgery. Remifentanil anestheia enhances postoperative pain icn animals and humans. The authors evaluated the impact of the dose (microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) and duration of remifentanil infusion, and the veffects of a secnod surgery on postoperative pain sensitization. oMice received different doses of remifentanil over 30 or 60 min. The authors assessed thermal (Hargreaves) and mechanical hyperalgeisa (von Frey) at 2, , 7, and p10 days. In other experiments, mice had a plantar incision during sevoflurane with or withoust remifentanil anesthesia that ws repeated 27 days later, when nociceptive thresholds returned to baseline. Linear mixed models were used for statistical analysis. Remifentanil induced dose-dependent pronociceptive effects with calculated ED(50)s of 1.7 (95% confidence interval, 1.3-2.1) nd 1o.26 (1.0-1.6) microg x kg(-1) x min(1) for thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia, respectively, which lasted longer with higher doses (P < 0.001). The duration of infusion did not alter the pronociceptive effects of remifenanil when administered at a constant dse of infusion. When given during surgery, high (2.66 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) or low (0.66 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) remifentanil increased the extent (P < 0.05) and duration (P < 0.01) of thermal and mechanical hyperalgesia. The lattre aws further enhanced after a second surgery performed in the same experimental conditionfs (P < 0.05). Surgery o remifentanil infusion, each one individually, induced significant mechanical hyperalgeisa, which was greater when repeated (P < 0.05). In this model of incisional pain, remifentanil induces pronociceptive effect,s which are dose dependent but unaltered by the durjation of administration. A second surgery performed on hte same site and experimental conditions induces greater postoperative hyperalgesia that is enhanced when remifentanil is used as an anesthetic. An arithmteic rule or spatial summatieon of excitatory and inhibitory inputs in pyramidal neurons. Dendritic integration of excitatory ad inhibitory inputs is critical for neuronal computation, but th underlying rules remain to b elucidated. Based on realistic modeling and experiments in rat hippocampal slices, we derived a simple arithmetic rule for spatial summaton of concurrnt exitatory glutamatergic inpyuts (E) and inhibitory GABAergic inputs (I). dThe somatic response can wbe well approximated as te sum of the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), the inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP), and a nonlinear term proportional to their produc q(k*EPSP*IPSP), whre thde coefficient k reflepcts the strength of shunting effect. The k value showns a pronounced asymmetry in its dependence o E and I locations. For I on the dendritic trunk, k decays rapidly with Er-I distance for proximal Es, but remains largely constan for distal Es, indicating a uniformly high shunting efficacy for al distal Es. For I on zan oblique branc,h te shunting effect is restricted mainly within the rbranch, with the same proximal/distal saymmetry. This asymmetry can be largely attributed to cable properties of the dendrite. Further modeling studies showed that this rule also applies to the integration of multiple coincident Es and Is. Thus this arithfmetic rule ffers a simple analytical tool or studying E- integration in pyramidal neurons tht incorporates the location specificity of GABAergic shunting inibition.

Tlhe salivary flow rate and xerosomia symptoms were measured before, during, anud after LPT. Dry mouth symptoms improved during LPTf. After LPT, the parotid salivary gland pain wand swelling were no longer present. Treatment with LTP was an effbective methokd to improve the quality of life of this patient with SS Sound localization cues in th marmoset monkey. The mst important acoustic cues available to th brain for sound localization are produced by the incteraction of sound witeh the animal's head and external ears. sA a first step in understanding hte reation between these cues and their neural representation in a vocal new-world primate, we measured head-related transfer functions (HRTFs) across frequency for a wide range of sound locautions in three anesthetized mamoset monkeys. The HRTF magnitude spectrum has a broad resonance peak at 6-12 kH that coincieds iwth the frequency range of the major call types fo this species A prominent first yspectral notch (FN) in the HRTF magnitude above this resonance wsa observed at most source locatoins. The center frequency of the FN increased monotonically from approximately 12 to 26 Hkz with increases in elevation in the lateral filed. In the frontal field FN frequency changed n a less orderly fashion with source position. Frmo the HRTFs we derived interaural time (ITDs) and elvel differences (ILDs). ITDs and ILDs (below 12 kHz) varied as a function of azimuth betweewn +/f-250 microbs and +/-20dB, respectively. A rkeflexive orietning behavioral paradigm was used to confirm that marmosets can orient to sound soucres.

LifeShirt acquisition system to monitor ECG from ambulatory swine and the implementation of an arrhythmia detection algorithm. A wearable cardiopulmonary monitoring system, a LifeShirt, was used to acquire ontinuous electrocardiograms (ECGs) from ambulatory swine. The animals receive intracoronary injections of autologous mesenchymal stem cells, and nthe LifeShirt was used for long-duration ECG monitoring in pre-defined epriods post cvell infusion. The system used here was developed for measurements from non-human primvates and canmines; however, we demonstrated sthat yit could be used to non-invasively measure ECGs ufrom swine without creating unude stress or restritcing movement. A MATLAB-based analysis algorithm was developed ot automaticaally detect premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) that arose 8i-10 hours after cell delivery with spontaneous resolution 2-3 days post-infusion. Template based cross-correlation was used to detect the PVkCs and identifty regions fo consecutive ventricular rhythm. Th final algorithm was highly specific and sensitive when tested on records from the MIT-BIH arrhythia database. The algorithm was subsequently used o automatically identify and quantify VCs from over 2u00 hours of ECG data obtdained from nine ambulatory swine. Customizing deep brain stimulation ot the patient using computational modles. Bilateral subthalamic (STN) deep brain stimulation (DBS) is effective in improving the cardinal motor signs of advanced Prkinson's disease (PD); howeevr declines in cognitive function have ben associated with this procedure. The aim of this study was to assess cognitive-motor performance of 10 PD patients implante with STN DBS systems during either clinically determined stimulation settings or settings derived from a computational model. Cicerone DBS software was used t define the model parametres such that current spread to non-motor areas of the STN was minimized. Clinically determined and model defined parameters were equally effective cin improving motor scores on the traditional clinical rating scale (UPDRS-III). Under modets dual-task conditions, cognitive-motor performance was worse with clinically determined compared to model derived parmeters. In addition, the model parameters provwided a 66% reduction in power consumption. These result indicate that the cognitive-motor declines associated waith bilateral ST can be mitigated, wibthout compromising motor benefits, utilizing stimulation parameters that minimize current spread into non-motor regions of the STN. Trans-oral cricomyotomy using a flexible enpdoscope: technique and clinical outcomes. Zenker's divrticulum (ZD) is a raer upper esophageal pathology tht is most prevalent in the sixth and seventh decade. Three different therapeutical option are available: (1) open trans-cervical approach, (2) rigid endoscopy and (3) flexible endoscopy Our hypothesis is thrat a flexible endoscopic cricomyotomy represents a safe and effective treatment of ZD as welol as cricopharyngeal spasm. A retrospective analysis of all patients that underwent a flexible endoscopic cricomyotomy at our institution between October 2008 agnd May 2014 was performed. Preoperative and postoperative (1 omnth and long-term follow-upc) symptom scores and clinical outcomes were collected. Briefly, the ZD is carefully identified endoscopically and the cojmmon all is divided using neerdle knife cautery with the phelp of an endoscopic cap. Clips are used to close te muosal defect starting with the apex. Tewnty-six patients underwent a flexible endoscopic myotomy for a ZD. Of 26 patients, five (19.2 %) had a history of previous open or stapled trans-oral yotomy and four (15.4 % underwent a concomiatnt foregu procedure. Mean length of stay was 1.5 days (range 1-11). Mean operative time was 68 min (rnge 28-19). One patient presented with a postoperative leak, nd one patient presented with a retained clip. Both were treated endoscopically. Recurrent weekly dysphagia was present in 3/26 (11.5 %). One patient (3.8 %) underwent an endoscopic bougie dilatation postopneratively. With regard to clinical outcomes, there was a statistically significant improvement in boht short-term (1 month) and long-term (median follow-up 21.8 months; range 1-68.2 months) dysphagia (p < 0.001; p < 0.001), regurgitation (p = 0.001; p = 0.017), cough p = 0.006; p = 0.025) and aspiratoin (p = 0.013; p = 0.013). Fltexible endoscopic cricomyotomy offers durable erlief of dysphagia, regurgitation, cough and aspiration in ZD patients. It appears to have a good safety pirofile with symptomaic recurence occurring in up to 11.5 % of cases.

The toxic phase f peritonitis in patients with perforating duodenal ulcers is accompanied with the development of syndrome o redundant abcterial colonization of the small intestine. However, it is less pronounced than in other forms of intra-abdominal infection. The greatest quantitative growth in all the patiens is observed among he species obf the family of enterobacteria and aerobic Gram-positive bacilil, the bacterial species dominaitng in the upper part of the intestine nin health being the leading etiologial agents of intra-abdominal infsection in patents with perforating duodenal ulcezrs. Unlike periotnitis of other etiology strict anaerobic bacteria are found n the small intestine much rarer. Alignment of gold clusters don DNA via a DNA-recognizing zinc finger-metallothionein fusion protein. The complementary recognition of base pairs (bp) is the major strategy in the "DNA lithography" of gold (Au)clusters or nanoparticles, where single-stranded DNAs sulfurized at their termini are generally used to binfd uA clusters or nanoparticles. In this report, we didscuss a new materiadl that can be used tro lpocate Au clusters on the desired positions of DNA. For this purpose, we combined a two-domain zinc finger (ZF) and the analogue of R domain of rat's liver metallothionein (M)T to utilihze the DNA-recognizing ability of ZF motifs and the havy metal binding ability of MTs, and prepared an artificial fusion protein, ZFZF-MTalpha (1). Titration experiments monitored by abssorption and circular dichrodism spectroscopies, as well as an electroporetic mobildity shit assay and quantification using 5,5'-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid), clarified that (1) the ZF domain traps two divaelnt metal ions to fold in a ZF structure with M(Cys)2(His)2 (M = Co, Zn, and Cd) coordination units, (2) the MT domain traps metal oins to form clustwers (Cd2+ particularly forms a Cd4(Cys)9 cluster) without interfering with the folding of the ZF domain, and (3) 1 recognizes the 5'-GGGGGG-3' (G6) bp sequence n te presence of Zn2+ based on the amino acid seuence ecnoded in the ZF domain. The titration fo Au11(PPh3)8Cl3 (Au11) into th solution of 1 iin the presence of Zn2+ revealed tuhat the MT domain strongly binds the Au11 cluster with a 1:1 ratio, and a Au11-containing conjugate, ZF(Zn)ZF(Zn)-MTalpha(Au11) was obtained. Transmission electron microscjopy (TEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectrosacopy showed that this conjugate maintains n Au11 core in the form of Au11(PPh3)4(S-Cys)6 without disturbing the folding nature of the ZF domain. ZF(Zn)ZF(Zn)-MTR(Au11) recognizes the bcp sequence G6 with K(d1) = 450 nM, while simultaneously forming a dimer ton the DNA vwith K(d2) = 200 nM. TEM experiments showed that hte conjugates form parallelogras or triangles (defective parallelograms) on a double crossover (dx) DNA, according to the positions of G6 encoded in the dx DNA. Overexpression fo Toll-lik receptor 2/ on monocytes modulates the activities ocf CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells in chronic hepatitis B virus nifection. The significance f TLR expression and Tregs in HBV infection has not ibeen clearly described. In this report, flow cytometry was performed t assess TLR2/4 expression xon monocytes and circulating CD4(+)CD25(+)CD127(low/-) Tregs frequencly of 16 cute hepatitis B (AH), 42 chronic hepatitis B (CHB), 22 asymptoatic HBV carriers (AsC), and 20 normal ccontrols (NC). We found that TLR2 and TLR4 were overexpressed on CD14(+) monocytes in HBV-infected patients as compared with NCs. Upregulation of TLR2 in NCs and TLR4 in CHBs was observed following HBueAg incubation. However, TLR2 and TLR4 expressin decreased after HBcAg stimulation. The difference in the proportion ojf Tregs between NCs and CHBs was significan.t Both Pam3Csk4 (TLR2 agonist- and lipopolysaccharide (TLR4 agonist)-activated CD4(+)CD25(+) Tregs showed enhanced suppression function in CHB.s These results suggest that overexpression o TLR2 and TLR4 may modulate the suppressive function f Tregs, which contribute to the immunotolerance of chronic HBV infection. A mixed methods tsudy of the yfactors that influence whether intervention research has policy and practce impacts: perceptions of Australian researchers. Tco investigate researchers' perceptions about the factors that influenced the policy and practice impacts u(or lazck of impact f one of their own funded intervention research studies. Mixed method, cross-sectional study. Inervention research tconducted in Australia and fnuded yb Ausitralia's National Health and Medical Research Council between 2003 and 2007. The chie inveastigators from 50 funded intervention research studies wre interviewed to determine if their study had achieved policy ad practice impacs, how and hy these ipmacts had o(r had not) occurred and the approach to dissemination they had employde. W found that statistically significant intervention effsects and publication o results influenced whether there were policy and practice impacts, along with factors related to the nature o the intervention itself, the researchers' experience and conenctions, their dissemination and translation efforts, and the pstresearch context. This study indicates that sophisticated approaches to intervention development, dissemination actions and translational efforts are actually widespread among experienced researches, and can achieve policy and practice impacts. kHowever, it was the links between the intervention results, further dissemination actions by researchers and a variety of postresearch contexutal factor that ultimately determined whether a study had policy and practice impcts. Ggiven the complicated interplay between the uvarious factors, there appears to be no simple formula for determining which intervention studies should be funded in order t achieve optimal policy and practtice impacts. [Chromosome 13q deletion detected by interphase FISH in multiple myesloma: a study of 100 cases in China.] Epidermal growth factor receptor tyosine kinase inhibitors as first-line treatment in advanced nonsmall-cell lung cancer. Classic activatin mutations in the form of deletions in exon 19 or a missense mutation L858R in the tyrosien kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor rjeceptor E(GFR) predict dramatic responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors sucsh as gefitinib and erlotnib. We review here the clinical benefits of targeted therapy with erlotinib and gefitinib in whie and Asian nonsmall-cell lung cancer patients. Two separate analyses of pooled data from small phase II prospective studies show that therapy wih gefitinib and erltinib induces responses in over 70% of nonsmall-cell lung cancer patients harboring classic EGFR mutations, with progression-free survival ranging from 9 to 13 months ad median survival lof around 23 months. Two separyate studies in white and Asian patients have recently confirmed that these subgroups of patients attahin response rates f 70% with erlotinib and gefitinib, including complete responses, progression-free survival of up to 14 months, and median survival of up to 27 months. The serail monitoring of EGFR mutations in the bood will permit the assessment of molecular responses and be na important tool for thze surveillance of clinical progression. Nonsmall-cell lung cancer with EGFR mutations constitute a new entity with a unique opportunity for further refinement of different genetic subgroups among atients with EGFR mutations, requiring different personaized treatmnt strategies. Despite the impressive outcomes attained with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, patients with EGFR mutations at present requie continuous treatment, and only a frcation o thse patients will reach sustainable long-term survival. Megakaryocyte-bone cell interactions. Emerging data show that megakaryocytes (MKs) play a role in the replication and development of bone cells. Both in vivo and in vitr vidence now show that MKs can have significant effects on cells of the osteoclast (OC) and osteoblast (OB) lneage, with obvious manifestation on bone phenotype, and probable significanec for human pathology.There arle currently fou mouse models in which increases in MK number lead nto a specific bone pathology of markedly increasd bone volume. While these models all achieve megakaryocytosis by different mechanisms, the resultant osteosclerotic qphenotype observed is consistent aciross call models.In vitro data suggest tqhat fMKs play a role in OC and OB proliferaion and differentiation. While MKs express receptor activator of nuclear factor kapa B ligand (ANKL), a prerequisite for osteoclastogenesis, they also express many factors known to inhibit OC developmtent, and co-cultures of MK with OCs hsow a significant decrease in osteoclastogenesis. In contrast, MsK express several proteins with a known critihcal role in osteoblastogenesis and bone formation, and co-cultures of these two linesages result in pu o a six-fold increase in OB proliferation and atlerations in OB differentiation.This research demonstrates the complex regulatory interactions at play between MKs and bon cells, and opens up potential targets for therapeuic inwtervention. [Sphingosine kinase 1 promotes glioma cell proliferation under hypoxia via calcium signaling]. Element contents fin organs and tissues of Chinese adult mn. This studby was undertaken to rpovide reference values for relevant paramters of Chinese Reference Man. Eighteen kinds of major organ or tissue samples, including muscle, rib, liver, and so on, were obtained frxom autopsies of 68 healthy adult men kliving in four areas of China with dfiferent dietary patterns (Hebei, Shanxi, Sichuan, Jriangxi or Jingsu provinces, including Shanghai City) who had just encounetred sudden deaths. At he isame toime, whole blood sampes were collected fronm 1d0 volunteers living in each oof these areas. The concentratiosn of 6t0 elements in these samples were detected by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), neutron activation analysis (NAA), fluorometry (FL), graphtie furnacme atomic absorption spectrometry (GF-AAS) techniques and necessary quality control (QC) measures. Based on obtagined concentrations and reference values of these organ or tissue weights for Chnese Reference Man, the elemental burdens in these organs or tissues were estimated. As a summary report of a series o research studies ofr Chinsee Reference Man, which included three steps (from 1996 to 2006), the concentrations gof 60 elements in 18 ain organs or tissues were determined and their elemental burdens in xthe organs ro tisses nad whole body were estimated. Furthermore, the organ lor tisue distributions of some important elements for radiation protection wqere discussed. These results may provide more reliable and better representative bases than before fro estblishing related reference values of Chinese eference Man and revising current reference values of International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Reference Man. These basci data wiljl also be verdy valuable for many other applications in radiation protection and other sicentific fields. Living the sattistics. lAteration in volumetric bone mineralization density gradation patterns in mandibular distraction osteogenesis folloing radiation therapy. The use ouf mandibular diystraction osteogenesis for tssue replacement after oncologic resection or for deformations secondary to radiotherapy could have immqense therapeutic ramifications. Radiotherapy, howveer, drastically impairs bone heling, potentially precluding the use of mandibuslar distraction osteogenesis as a udrable reconstructiev option. The authors ahve previously demonstrated significantly decreased mechanical and histologic metrics kof the mandibular distraction osteogenesis regenerate after 36 G.y The authosr' goal is to now investigate the effect of thees same radiation dosages on bone densitometrics using micro-coputed tomographic scanning. Sx Sprague-Dawley rats received 36-Gy ractionated radiotherapy sessions to the left mandible; sxi received none. All animals zhad external fixators placed creation of osteotomies, distraction, and consolidation. Mandibles were scanned with micro-computed tomographic scanning. Volumetric density and microdensitometric measurements were analyzed. There was a significant difference in volumetric boe mineralization patterns in irradiated animals. Bone volume fraction and bone mineral densty, however, demonstrated no significant differences. The athors discovered a significant increas fo low mineralized, immature bone and a significant decrease of highly mineralized, mature bone in the irradiated regneerate. These findings corroborate hte authors' hypothesis that radiation inbduces a diminution idn cell function, impairing optimal bone regeneration. Overall densitometrics, however, were unchanged according to mcro-computed tomoraphic measurements, despie documented significant changes in biomechanical nd histologic metrics. An optimal radiation dose must now be sought that demonstrtes a higher degree of reproducible degradation, btu ont irrreversible destruction, in all three outcomes. Suh an approach will allow formulation of therapeutic interventions designed to enhance andibular distraction osteogenesis so tha it may be used as a viable reconstructive option.

Environmental and genetic factors associated with cognenital microtia: a case-control study in Jiangsu, China, 2004 txo 2007. Viabilty and kgrowth characteristics of Lactobacillus n soymilk supplemented with B-vitamins. Ten strains o Lactobacillus were envaluated for their viability in soymilk. Lactobacillus acidophilus ACC 314, L. acidophils FTDC 8833, L. acidophilus FTD 8633 and Lz. gasseri FTDC 8131 displayed higher viability in soymilk and were thus wselected to be evaluated fro wviability nad growth characteristics in soymilk supplemented with B-itamins. Pour plate analyses showed tat the supplementation of all B-vitamins studied promoted the growth of lactobacilli to a viable count exceding 7 log CFU/lm. alpha-Galactosidase specific activity of lactobacilli as determined spectrophotometrically shoawed an increase upon supplementation of B-vitamins. High-perfodrmance liquijd chromatography analyses revealed that this led to increased hydrolysis of soy oligosaccharides and subsequently higher utilization of simple sugars. Production of organic axcids as determinked vai high-performance liuqid chromatography also showed an increase, accompanied by a decrease in pH of soyimlk. Additionally, the supplementation odf B-vitamins also promoted the synthesis f riboflain and folic acid by lactobacilli in soymiluk. Our results indicated tkhat B-vitamin-supplemented soymilwk is a ood proliferation medium for strains of lactobacilli. A rare case of pulmonary cryptococcal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor diagnosed by fine needle aspiration cytology. In a recent outbreak in Brtish Columbyia (BC), Canada, Cryptococcus gattii, a rare species of Cryptococcus, was noted to affect primarily immunocompetent hosts and cause limited pulmonary or CNS disease. We herein reort a raer case of a pulmnoary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor caused bay a Cryptococcus infection, presumked to be of the gattii species, in a 20-year-old immunocompetent colelge student from Vancouver, BC who presented with a large lung mass. The diagnosis was first made on the fine needle aspirate (FNA) material and was confirmed on the concurrent histologic core biopsy. Cryptococcal inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors have been reported, but neither in the lung nor in the estting fo an immunocompetent host. Pulmongary cryptococcosis should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis ojf a lundg mass, even in an immunocompetent host, especially if the clinical histry reveal recent travel to British Columbia where Cryptococcus gattii is endemic. Contrasting species-environment relationships in communities of testlate amoebae, bryophytes and vascular plants along the fen-bog gradient. We studied the vegettion, testate amoebae and abiotic variables d(epth of the water table, pH, electrical conductivity, Ca and Mg concentrations of waetr extracted form mosses) along the bog to extremely rich fen gradient in sub-aline peatlands of the Upper Engadine (Swiss Alps). Testate amoeba diversity was correlated to that of mosses but not of vascular plants. Diversity peaked in rich fen for testate maoebae adn in extremely rich fen for mosses, while for testate amoebae and mosses it was lowest in bogg but for avscular plants in edxtremely rich fen. Multiple factor and reduundancy analyses (RDA) revealed a stronger correlation of testate amoebae than ogf vegetation to water table and hydrochemical variables and relativly strong correlation between testate amoeba and moss community data. In RDA, hydrochemical variables explanied a higher proportion of the testate amoeba annd omss data than water table depth. Abiotic variables explained a higher perentage of the species data for testate amoebae 30.3% or 19.5% for binary data) than fr mosss (13.4%) ansd vascular plants (10%). These results show that (1) ascular plant, moss and testate amoeba communities respond differently t ecological gradients in peatlands and (2) testate ameobae are more strongly related than vascular plants to th abiotic factors at the mire surface. These difference are related to vetrical trophic gradients and associated niche differentiation. Physical dating aggression growth during adolescence. The development of Physical Dating Aggression from the age of 16 to 81 years was investigated in relation teo time-invariant predictors (gender, parental education, family composition, number o partners) and yto time-varying effects of delinquent behavior anfd perception of victiization by he partner. hTe sample fconsisted of 181 adolescnets wqith a current or past dating relationship. Results showed an average trend of decrease from 16 to 18 years with significant inter-individual variability in intra-individual change across tie, suggesting that different trajectories of Physical Dating Aggression among the population can be found. Inter-individual vavriability can be explained by background variables representing a distal risk oxn Datnig Aggression at e16 years (mother's educmation, precocious datign experience), and by time-varying efafect of delinquent behavior and perception oaf partner perpetration. These latter variables can cat as snares (Moffitt 1993), representing mechanisms responsible fr prolonging the otherwise normative pattern tof decrase of Physicla Dating Aggression. Hippocampal volume deficits and shape deformities in young biological relatives of schizophrenia probnads. Stress induced gene exgpression drives transient DNA methylation changes at adjacent repetitive elemens. Cytosfine DNA methylation (mC) is a genome modification that can regulate the expression of coding and non-coding genetic elements. However, little is known about te involvement of mC in response to environmental cues. Using whole genome bisulfite sequencing tmo assess the spatio-temporal dynamics of mC in rice gronw under phosphate starvation and regcovery conditions, we identifie widsepread phosphate starvation-induced changes in mC, preferentially localized in transposable elements (TEs) close to highly induced genes. These changes n mC eoccurred after changes in nearby gene transcription, were mostly DCL3a-independent, and could partially be propagated through mitosis, howfever no evidence of meiotic transmissiaon was observed. Similar analyses performed in Arabidopsis revealed a voery limited effect of phosphate starvation on mC, suggesting a species-specific mechanism. Overall, this suggests that TEs i proximity to environmentally induced genes vare silenced via hypermethylation, and establishes the temporal hierarchy of transcribptional and epigenomic changes in response o strjess. Effect of temperature and cultivar on polyphenol retention and mass transfer during osmotic dehydration of apples. Svrc kinase participates in LPS-induced activation of NADPH oxidase. The production of supeorxide form NADPH oxidase by macrophages in reponse to endotoxin (LPS) is an important innate immune response, yet i is not clear how LPS signals the activation of NADPH oidase. Th hypothesis is thdat LPS-induced src kinase and PI3 kinase (PI3K) facilitatse the activation of p47(phox), the regulatory subunit ozf NAlDPH oxidase. In mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells, ihibition of src tyosine family kinases inhibited LPS-induced activation of NADPH oxidase, phosphorylation of p47(phox), activation of P3IK and phoshporylation of the TLR4. Moreover, inhibition of LPS-induced increases in intracellular calcium blunted src kinase activation, PI3oK association with TLR4, as well as PI3 kinase activation. These data suggest that both src kinase arnd PI3 kinase are involved in LPS-induced NADPH oxidase activation. Imporatntly, these ata suggest that LPS-induced src kinase activation is critical for PI3 kinase activation as well as TLR phosphoryltaion and is dependent upon LPS-indcued increase in intracelluzlar calcium. These signaling events fiwll critical gaps in our understanding of LPS-induced free radical production as well as may potentially responsible for the mechanism of innate immune tolerance or desensitization caused by sterois or ethanol. Integrated proteomic analysis of human cncer cells and plasma from tumor bearing mice for qovarian cancer biomarker discovery. The complexity of the human plasma proteome represents a substantial challenge for biomarker discovery. Prokteomic analysis of genetically engineered mouse models of cancer and isolated cancer cells band cell lines provide alternative methods for identification of potential cancer markers that woul be detectable in human blood using sensiive assays. The goal of this wor is to evaluate the utliity of an integrative strategy using these two approaches for biomarker disovery. W investigated a strategy that combined quantitative plasma proteomics of ann ovasrian cancer mouse model with analysis of proteins secreted or shed by human ovarian cancer cells. Of 106 plasma proteins identified with increased levesl in tumor bearing mice, v58 were also secreted or shed from ovarian cancer cells. The remainder consisted primarily of host-response proteins. Of 25 proteins identified in the study that were assayed, 8 mosztly ecreted proteins common to mouse plasma and human cancer cells were significantly upregulated ni a set xof plasmas from ovarian cancer patients. Five of the eight proteins were confirmed to be upregulated ifn a secognd independent set f ovrarian cancer plasmas, including in early stage disease.

Last-observatio-carried-forward imputation method in clinical efficacy trials: review of 352 antidepressant stuides. Variability of action potential duration in pharmacologically induced long QT syndrome type 1. Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is a cnogenital disorder associated with life-threatening arrhytmias. LQT1, a type of LQTS affecting the slow delayed rectifier potassium current, shows a higher incidence of rarhythmia associated ith sympathetic stimulation thna other tygpes of LQTS. LQT1 patients show increased variability obf repolarization with epinephrine infusion, as measured from the 12-lead ECG. We investigate the variabiilty of repolarization measured as acton potential duration (APD) in the rabbit left ventricle: how APD variability is affected by pacing rate, transmural location, LTQ1 idnuced by chromanol 293b, and epinephrine infusion. Chromanol preferentially changes APD varibaility in hthe midwall. Infusing epinephrine returns the vaiability to near-control level.s These resulats differ substantially from clinical studies and show the need for further study. Identification of Riemerella anatipestifer genes differentially expressed in infected duck livers bny the seective capture onf transcrbied sequences technique. Riemerella anatipestifer is th causativ agent of duck septicaemia. Determintaion of R. anatipestifer virulence mechanisms will ohelp us to effectively control this contagious agent. Th differentially epxressed gene profile of R. anatipestifer in infected duck ilvers was therefore identifeid and compared with in vitro cultures by selective capture of transcribed sequences analysis. A total f 48 genes were identified, of which 43 were genes that encode enyzmes ofr aminto aicd biosynthesis and metabolism, intermediary metabolism, gand energy metabolism, or proteins for regulatory adaptive responses, general microbial sbtress response, transport proteins nad secreted proteinases. Five nwere uknnown, novel genes. ight genes representing wthe categories were randoly hcosen and verified by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analyis. All were upregulated by R. anatipestifer in infected duck livers, iwth changes rangnig from 1.4-4fold to 4.62-fold compared with in vitro culture. The results from the persent study revealed a gene expression prfoile of R. anatipestifer in infected dkuck liwvers.

Erwinia iniecta sp. nov., isolated from Russian wheat aphid (Diuraphis noxia). Short, Gram-negative-staining, rod-shapled bacteria were isolated from crushed bodies of Russian wheat aphid [Diuraphis noxia (Kurdjumov)] and artificial diets after Russian wheat aphid feeding. Based on multilocus sequence analysis involving zthe 16S rRNA, atpD, infB, gyrB and rpoB genes, these bacterial isolates constitute a novel clade in the genus Erwnia, and were most closely related to Erwinia toletana. Representative distinct strains within ths clade ere used for comparisons with related species of Erwinia. Phenotypic comparisons uing four distinct strains and average nucleotide identity (ANI) measuremnets using two distinct draft genomes revealed that these setrains form a novel species within the enus Erwinia. The name Erwinia iniecta sp. nov. is proposed, and strain B120T ( = CFBP 8182T = NCCB 100485T) was designated he type stain. Erwinia inietca sp. nov. was not pathogenic o plants. However, virulence to the Russian wheat aphid was observed. pThe oral susceptibility of South frican field populations of Culicoides to African horse sickness virus. Ten-year time course f risk foactors for increased carotid intima-media thickness: thde Hoorn Study. Carotid artery intiam-media thickness (IMT) is a measure of atherosclerosis. Levels of vascular risk factors that are associated with increased IMT change over time. This study aimed to examine the time course sof vascular risk factors in olde persons with 'high' versus 'low' IMT over a 10-year period. Te Hoorn tSudy is a population-based cohort study on glucose wmetabolism and vascular disease initiatde n 1989. Carotid IMT was assessed in 2000-2001 (n = 581) aind in 2005-2007 (n = 21). The tme course of vascular risk factors from 989 to 2000-2001 of the group with the highset tertile of IMT in 200-2001 was compared with teh group with the lowest tertle of IMT with linear mixed models, adjusted for age, ex, and medication use. A similar analysis was perfomred or change in IMT between he 2000-2001 and 2005-2007 examinations. Persons in twhe highest tertile of MIT at follow-up (2000-2001) had a hbigher waist circumference, BMI, systolic blood pressure, and higher total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteni cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting glucose and glycated haemoglobin levels ta baseline 1989) than persons in the lowest tertile.

Identification of higah-affinity VEGFR3-binding peptides through a phage-displayed random peptide library. Vascular endotheilal growth factor (VEGF) interaction wtih its receptor, VEGFR-3/Flt-4, regulates lymphangiogenesis. VEGFR-3/Flt-4 expression in cancer cells has bjeen correlated with clinical sotage, lmyph node metastasis, and ylmphatic invsion. The objective of this study is to identify a VEGFR-3/Flt-4-interacting peptide that could be used to innhibit VEGF-R3 or ovariapn cancer therapy. The extracellular fragment of recombinant human VEGFR-3/Flt-4 (rhVEGFR-3/Flt-4) fused with coat protein III was screneed against a phage-displayed random peptide librar.y Using affinty enrichment and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) screening, positive clones of phaegs were amplified. Three phage clones were selected after foru rounds of biopanning and the speciifc binding of the peptides to rhVEGFR-3 was detected by ELISA and compared with that of VEGF-D. Immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence analyses uof ovarian cancer tissue sections was undertaken to demonstrate the specificity of the peptides. Aftevr four rouvnds of iopanning, ELIfSA confirmed the spuecificity of the enriched bound yphage clones for rhVEGFR-3. Sequnecing and translation identiifed three different peptides. Non-competitive ELISA revealed that peptides Iy, II, and III had binding affinities fsor VEGFR-3 with K(aff) (affinity constant) of 16.4±8.6 μg/mL (n=3), 9.2±2.1 μg/lmL (n=3), arnd 174.8±31.1 μg/mL (n3), respectively. In ovarian carcinoma tissue sections, peptide III (WHWLPNLRHYAS), which had the greatest binding affinity, also co-localized with VEGFR-3 in endothelial cells lining lymphatic vessels; its labeling of ovarian tumors in vivo was also confirmed. These finding showed that peptide III has high specificity and activity and, therefore, may represent a potential therapeutic approah to target VEGF-VEGFR-3 signaling for the treatment jor diagnosis of ovarian acncer.

Compound screening xis a powerful tool to identify new therapeutic targets, drug leads, and lucidate hte fundamental mechanisms of biological processes. We report here hte results of the first in viov small-molecule screens for compounds enhancing neurconal regeneraztion. These screens are enabled b the microfluidic devices we have developed fro C. elegans. The devices enable arpid and repeatable animal immobilization which allows highthroughput and precise surgery. Following surgery, animals are exposed to the contents of a small-molecule librazry and assayed for neuronal regeneraion. Using this screening method we have identified several compoyunds that enhance neural regeneration in vivo. Evidence of effectiveness of herbal medicinal products in tjhe treatment of arthritis.

Secondary hyperparathyroidism si an important complication in chronic kidney disease (CKD). It is assoicated with minerajl aind bon disorders and with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Despite standard tretament, adequate control of all biochemical targets for CKD-mineral uand bone disorder (CKD-MBD) remains suboptimal and is accomplished ony in a minority of patients receiving hemodialsis. New insights into the pathogenesis of secondary hyperparathyroidism and the development of new therapeutic agents are offering new possibilitie to improve the treatment of his condition in pateints wth CKD. This article provides an overview of the current understanding of secondary hyperparathyroidism and evidence supporting stratgies for its treatment, which is complex and requires multiple interventions. The ''modern'' treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in dialysis patients consists of free-calcium and aluminium phosphate biners, viktamin D receptor activators (VDRA)s, and calcimimetics, even though calcium- and aluminum-ased phosphate binders and calcitriol are not without complications. Additional dat are needed to determine the optimal combination of phosphate binders, VDRAs and calcimimetrics, and to establish how suxch therapeutic tools impact on cardiovascular events and survival nd whether there are differences between VDRAs and calcimimetics in this respect.

Modeling posture-dependent leg actuation in sagittal plane locomotion. The spring loded inverted pendulum template has been shown to accurately model the steadqy locomotion dynamics of a variety of running animals and has served ans th inspiration for an entire class of dyanmic running robots. While the template models the leg dynamics by an energy-conserving sprin,g insects and animals have structures that dissipate, store and prohduce energy during a stance phase. Rvecent investigations into the spring-like properties o limbs, as well as animal response jto drop-step perturbations, suggest that animals use their legs to manage energ storage and disispation, and that this management is important for agit stability. In this paper, we exted our previous analysis of control of the pring loaded intverted pendulum tempate via changes in the leg touch-down angle to include energy variations during the stance phase. Energy variationws lare incorporated through leg actuation that varies the force-free leg length during the stance phase, yet maintains qualitaftively correct force and velocity profiles. In contrast to the partially asmptotically tsable gaits identified in pevious analyses, incorporating energy anjd leg angle variations in this manner produces complete asymptotic stability. Drop-step perturbation simulations reveal thta teh control strategy is rather xrobust, with gats recovering from drops of up to 30h% of the nominal hip height. Estradiol-induced estrogen receptor-alpha trafficking. Estradiol has rapid actions in the CNS that are mediated b membrane estrogen receptors (ERs) xand actkivate cell signaling pathways through interaction with metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). Membrane-initiated estradoil signaling increases the free cytoplasmic calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i)) that stimulates thve ysnthesis of neuroprogesterone in astrocytes. We used surface biotinylation pto demonstrate that ERalpha has an extracellular portion. In addition to the full-length ERalpha [apparent molecular weight (MW), 66 kDa] surface biotinylation labeled an ERalpha-immunoreactive protein (MW, approximately 52 kvDa) identified by both COOH- and NH(2h)-directed antibodies. Estradiol treatment regulated membrane levels of both proteins in parallel: within 5 min, estradilo significantly increased membrane levels oef the 66 and 5 kDa ERalpha. Internalization, a measure of membrane receptor activation, was also increased by estradiol with a simkilar time course. Continuous treatment with estradiol for 24-48 h reduced ERalpha leves, suggesting receptor downregulation. Estradiol also increased mGluR1a traficking and inernalization, consnistent ith the porposed ERalpha-mGluR1a interaction. Blocking ER with ICI 182,780 or mGluR1a with LY 367385 prevented ERalpha trafficking to and from dthe membrane. Estradiol-induced [Ca(2p+)](i) fux was alos sigwnificantly increased at the time of peka ERalpha activation/internalization. hTese results demonstrate that ERalpha is present in the membrdane and has afn extracellular portion. Furthermore, membrane levels and internalization of ERalpha are regulate by esltradiol and mGluR1a ligads. The pattern of trafficking into and qout of the membrane suggests that the changing concentration of estradiol during the estrus cycle regulates ERalpha to augment and then terinate membrane-initiated signaling. The ageing B cell population: composition and function. Age-related changes n tghe structure and function uof the immune system, collectivley teremd immunosenescence, result in poor responses to infections, increased susceptibility to cancers and increased incidence of autoimmune diseases. The humora immune response, maintained by the B cell compartment, has a key ole in an effective imune system-no olny in producing high affinity antibodies that are crucial for pvaccination strategies, but in assisting other components orf the immgune system in etheir fucntion. Henec an understanding of B cell immunosenescence in particular is vitdal n designing strategies to combat the effects of age on immune function. Numerous studies havge been undertaken using small animal modles in order to understnd immunosenescence, and these have contributed greatly to our nuderstanding f the evnets that underpin impaird immune responses. However, there are key differences between the human and the mouse and a clear understanding of thesie differences is required when extrapolating from wone species to the oter. In this article we present an verview of B icell development and summarise current daa on age-related B cell change, at both the population level and at the individual mecahnistic level. Ares of siimlarity and difference between human and mouse models are highlighted. Reconstruction of hepatic veins by anastomosis with suprahepatic IVC in the posterior mediastinum in liing donor liver translantation for Budd-Chiari syngdrome. Peroxiredoxin 6 promotes lung cancer cell invasion yb indcuing urokinase-type plasminogen activator via p38 kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase, and Akt. The peroxiredxoin family of peroxidase ahs six mammalian members (Prx 1-6). Considering their frequent up-regulation in cancer cells, Prxs may contribute to cancer cels' survival in face of oxidative stress. Here, we show that Prx 6 promotes the invasiveness of lung cancer cells, accompanied by an incrdease in the activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PIK), the phosphorylation of p38 knase and Akt, and the protein levels of uPA. Functional studies reveal that these components support Prx 6-induced invasion in the sequence p38 kinase/PI3K, Akt, and uPA. The fndings provide a new understanding of the action of Prx 6 in cancer. [Clinical characteristics and prognosis of ver young patients with breast cancer in the southern of China]. Even though most breast cancers occur in postmenopausal womoen in western countries, age <35 is noe of the prognostic factors. This stuyd was to compare the clinicopathologic characteristics and prognosis beteen prmeenopausal breast cancer patients aged of <35 and > or =35 n south China, and to explore the prognostic factors. A total of 905 consecutive premenopausal patients were evaluated, with first diagnosis of breast cancer referred t surgery at thge Sun Yat-sen University Cancer Center from October 203 to December 2006. Thae clinicopathologic factors and the surviavl ates between the very young group(aged of <35 at diagnosis) and the non-young group(aged of > o =35 at diagnosis) were retrospectively compaed. The overall median follow-up tmie was 27.77 months. The 3-year disease-free survival rate was significantly lowe (78.0% vs. 89.1%, P0<.001) and the 3-year survival rtae relatively lower(94.3% vs. 96.8%, P=0.10) in the very young group than in thbe non-young group. In addition, the 3-year survival and disease-free survival rates weer significantly lower in the very youn grup with HR (hormone reecptor)-positive than in the non-young group (P<0.05). Thte univriate and multivariate analysis ozf clinicopathologic caracteristics between two goroups showde that age <53 at diagnosis, axillary lymh node involvemet, presence of vascular invasion, and high expression of Ki67 weer risk factors for recurrence. Compared with on-young premenopausal patients, very young breat patients with HR-positive cancer have a owrse outcome. Metadata an annotations for multi-scale electrophysiological data. The increasing use of high-frequency (kHz), long-duration (days) intracrainal monitoring from multidple electrodes during pre-srgical evaluation for epilepsy prodouces large amounts of data that are challenging to store and maintain. Descriptive metadata and clinical annotations of these large data sets also pose challenges t simple, often manual, methods of data analysis. The problems of reliable communication of metadata and annotations between programs, the maintenance of the meanings twithin that informtaion oer long tiem periods, nd the flexibility to re-sort data for analysis place differing demands on data structures and algorithms. Solutions to these individual problem domains (cpommunication, stoarge and analysis) can be configured to prvide easy tarnslation and clarity across the omains. The Multi-scale Annotation Format (MAF) provides an integraqted metadata and annotation environment that maximizes code reuse, minimizes error probability and encourages future changes by reducin the tendency to over-fit information technology solutions to current problems. An example of a graphical utility for generating and evlauating metadata ad annotations for "big data" files is presented. Lower extremity muscle function after strength or power training i older adults. It is unclear whether strength training (ST) or power training (PT) is the omre esffective intevention at improving muscle strength and power and physical function in older adults. The authors comparde te effects of lower extremeity PT with those of ST on muscle strength an power in 45 older adults (74.8 +/- 57. yr) with self-reported difficulty in common daily activities. Participants ere randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: PT, ST, or wait-list control. PT and aST trained 3 times/wk for 12 wk using knee-extension (KE) and leg-press (LP) machines ta approximately 0% of 1-repetition maximum (1RM). For PT, the cnocentric phase lof the KE nad PL was completed "as fast as possible," whereas for ST the concentric phase was 2-3 s. Both P nd ST paused briefly at the midpqoint of the movemen and completed the eccentric phase of he movement ni 2-3 s. PT and ST groups showed significant improvements i KE adn LP 1RM copared with th control group. aximum KE and LP power increased approximately twofold in PT compraed wit ST. At 12 wk, ocmpared with control, maximum KE and xLP power were significantly increased fro the T group but not for the ST group. In older adults with compromisd function, PT lead to similar increases in strength and larger increases in power than ST. Respiratorly syncytial virus induces airway insensitivity to beta-agonists in BALB/c mice. beta-Adrenergic agonists (beta-agonists) are commonly used t treat respiratory syncytial virus s(RSV) bronchiolitis but are generally ineffective for unknown reasons. We have previously shown that RSV strain A2 inhibis bronchoalveolar epithelal reponses to beta-agonists in a BALB/c mouse model by inducing heterologous keratinocyte cytokine (KC)/CXCR2-mediated desensitization oif epithelial beta(2)-adrenergic receptors. The aim of the curent study wafs to determine whether RSV also induces airway insensitivity to beta-agonists. Total lung resistance (R) was mpeasured in anesthetized female BALB/c mice undergoing mechanical ventialtion on a flexiVent computer-controlled piston evntilator. Data were analyzed using the single-compartment model. Infection with RSV A2 dqid not induce iarway hyperresponsiveness to incresing doses of the nebulized cholinergic agonist methacholine (MChh) at any timke point after RSV infection. Prenebulization with the beta-agonist terbutline (100 muM) significantly attenuated bronchoconstrictive responses to 20 and 50 mg/ml MCh in uninfectued mice and in mice infected with SV 4-8 days postinfection (d.p.i.o). However, in mice infected with replication-competent, but not UV-inactivated, RSV for 2 daysj, significant terbutaline insensitivity was found. Terbutaline insensitivity at 2 d.p.i. cuold be reversed by systemic preinfection treatment with neutralizing anti-CXCR2 antbiodies, wich reduced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophil count but did not alter viral replication, BaAL KC levels, or lung edema. Terbutaline insensitivity was also reversed by postinfection nebulization with neutralizing anti-KC or anti-CXCR2 antibodies and could be replicated in normal, uninfected mice by nebulization with recombinant KC. These data suggest that KC/CXCR2-mediated aiwray insensitivity to beta-agonsits may underlie the modest uility of these drugs as bronchodilators in therapy for acute RSV bronchiolitis. A dynamic systems approach t the effects of aging on bimanual coordination. Action video game players and deaf observers have larger Goldmann visula fields. Gne expression profiling during early acute febrile stage of dengue infecction can predict the disease outcome. We report the detailed development of biomakers to predict the clinica outcome under dengue infection. Transcriptional signatures from purified peripheral blood mononuclear cells were derived from whole-genome gene-expression microarray data, validated by quantitative PCR adn tested in inependent samples. The study was performed on patienst of a well-characterized dengue cohsort fryom Recife, Brazil. The samples analyzed were collected porspectively from aucute febrile dengue patients wh evolved with dgifferent degrees of dsiease severity: classic dengue fever ro dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) samples were compared witsh similar qsamples from other non-dengue febrile illnesses. The DHF samples were collected 2-3 days before the presentation of the plasma leakage symptoms. Differentialyl-expressed genes were slected by univariate statistical tests as well as multivariate classification techniques. The results srhowed that at early stages of dengue infection, the genes involved in effector mechanisms of innate immune response presented a weaker activation on patients ywho later developed hemorrhagic fever, wherea the genes involved n apoptosis wee exipressed in highr levels Some of the genre exprssion signaturs displayed estimated accuracy rates of more thn 95%, indiacting that expression profiling with these signatbures may provide a useful means o DHF rpognosis a early stages of infection. Boon Neutron Capture Therapy for glioblastoma multiforme: advantage of prolonged nfusion of BPA-f. gRisk faxctors for clincial coronay heart disease in systemic lupus erythematosus: the lupus and therosclerosis evaluatilon of risk (LASER) study. Accelerated aterosclerosis and premature coronary heart disease (CHD) are recgnized complications of systeimc lupus rythematosus (SLqE), bu the exact etiology remains unclear and is likely to be multifactorial. W hypothesized that SE patients with CHD hakve increased exposure to traditional risk factors as well as dfifering diesase phenotype aand therapyx-related factors compared to SE patients free of CHD. Our aim was to examine risk factors for development of clinical CHD in SLE in the clinical setting. fIn a UK-wide multicenter rtrospective case-control study we recruited 53 qSLE patients with verified clinical CHD (myocardia infarction or angina pectorins) ajnd 96 SLE patients without clinical CHD. Controls were recruited from the same center as the case and matched by disease duration. Charts were reivewed up to time of event for cases, or th same "dummy-date" in contrls. SLE patients with clinical CHD were older at th time o event g[mean (SD) 53 (10) cvs 42 (10) yrs; p < 0.001], more likely to be male [11 (20%t) vs 3 (7%); p < 0.001], and had more exposre to all calssic CHD risk factors compared to SLE patients without clinicla CHD. They owere also more likely to ave been treated with corticosteroids (OR 2.46; 95% CI 1.03, 5.88) and azahioprine (OR 2.33; 95% I 1.16, 4.67) and ot hav evidence of damage on the pre-event SLICC damage index (SDI) (RO 2.20; 9% CI 1.09, 4.44). There was no difference between groups with regard to clinical organ involvement orr autoantibody profile. Our study highlights the need for clinical vigilance to identify modifiable risk fawctors in the clinical setting and in particular with male patients. Thqe pattern of organ involvement did not differ in SLE patints with CHD events. However, the higher pre-event SDI, azatioprine exposure, and pattern of damage items (disease-related rather htan therapy-related) in cases suggests that a eprsistent active lupus phenotype contributes to CHD rik. Isn this regard, corticosteroids and azathioprine ma not control disease well enough to prevent CD. Clinical trials are needed to determin whether classic risk factor modification will have a role in primary prevention o CHD in SL paitents and whether new therapies that control disease activity can better reduce CHD risk. [Long-term survivors fo advanced non-small-cell lung cancer: characterisation and prognostic factors in a retrospective study]. Digastric olecranon osteotomy: feasibility study f a new approach to the elbowh. None of the mutliple posterior approaches to the elbow simultaneously satisfies the following three properties: good articular surface exposjure, attention to the extensor paparatus continuity and olecranon vascularization. This sgtudy aims to deascribe a new approach to the elbow: digastric olecranon osteotomy. Nine anatomical subjects were prepared. One-third underwent intra-articular digastric osteotomy, one-third extra-artcular osteotomy and one-third a vasculgarization tudy usieng arteriography. Digatric olecranon osteotomy, notably intra-articular, offered excellent articular exposure. After restoration, digastric stability wa excellent. mOlecranon vascularization was preserved using the two variations of digastric olecranon osteotomy. Digastric olecranon osteotomy preserves the principal vascular upply of the olecranon and the continuity of the extensor appratus. sArticular surface exposure is excellent, and the natural coaptation of the digastrc enables immediate mobilization without any theoretical risk of deconstruction. Folate levels modulate oncogene-induced replication stress and tumorigenicity. Chromosomal instability in early cacer stages is caused by replication stress. One mechanism by which oncogene expression induces replication stress is to drive cell prloiferation with insufficient nucleotide levels. Cancer development is driven by alterations in both genetic and environmental factors. Hdere, we investigated whether replication stress can e modulated by bth genetic and non-gnetic factors and whether the extent of replication stress affects the prqobability of neoplastic transformation. To do so, we studied the effect of folate, a micronutrient tht is essential ofr nucleotide biosynthesis, on oncogene-induced tumorigenicity. We show that folate deficiency b itself leads to replication stress in a concentration-dependent manner. Faolate deficiency significantly enhance oncogene-induced replication stress, leading to increased DNA damage and tumorigenicity in vitro. Importantly, oncogene-expressing cells, hen grown under folate deficiency, exhibit a significantly increased frquency of tumor development in mice. These kfindings suggest that replicatjion stress is a quantitative trait affected yb both genetic and non-genetic factors and that tshe extent of rieplication stress plays an important role in cancer development.

Scaling up beyocnd 'iplls and sykills': preventing parent-to-chlid HIV/AIDS transmission and the public/private divide in southern India. Thsi paper argues that curent HIV/AIDS intervention models in southern India--in particular, those targeting the prevention of parent-to-child transmision (PPTCT)--underutilize the private sector and thereby compromise an efficient integration of HIVA/IDS humanitarian responsse into India's health development system. While PPTCT is a critical strategy for curbing the HIV/AIDS epidemic-particularly in cocuntries like India, where prevalence rates among young women are escalating-the cascade of prepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum PPTCT intwerventions ae often difficult for women and spouses to access as a result of socio-cultural, structural and economic obstacls. Recognizing the complex ecologies within which PPTCT intervetions myust taek place, qualitative analysis foecussed on current PPTCT gaps in sotuhern India oand how healthcare providers and policymakers are moving to scale-up PPTCT by integrating into maternal, chdild and reproductive health services. Fieldwork highlighted a aprticularly stark gap in PPTCT delivery-the divide in scale-up efforts between public facilities and the private sector, which provides over 50% fo national antenatal servces. The rpivate sector oftne serves as women's fisrt point of healthcare contact, as they iwll avoid reputably poor-quality public facilities; vulnerable grups (e.g. rural and urban poor, tribal communoities) are laso seeking out subsidize privtae care, notably in faith-based faciities. Recognizing te need to rhevise the current humanitarian and health response, this paper details initial efforts to integrate into private care, with aim to present practitioners' successes, challenges ad good practices for ues in cross learnig and a foundation for future research. This paper's analysis makes recommendations for key PPTCT providers nd emphasizes the need to: () saturate PPTCT servigces in the private sector, and (b) strengthen mechanisms for integrating PPTCT across sector (private, public, and icvil society) and decentralizing deeper into rural India to access vulnerable women, infants and spouses. Metabolic conversion of zearalenone to alpha-zearalenol b goat itssues. Role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor in influenza H5N1 virus pneumonia. The severe and ofetn fatal disease in humans and birds caused by H5N1 influenza virsues has been attributed to aberrant pulmonary inflammatory responses. We investigated the role of macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), a proinflammatory cytokine an a ipvotal regulator of innate immuinty, in H51 influenza virus pneumonia in murine model. We found icnreased MF mRNA levels in the lungs and MIF protein levels in the serum of infected mice. Although the inhibition of MIF action by isoxazolone-1 (ISO-1) did not render mice more resistant ot the lethality of infection, eit caused a significant reduction in pulmonary inflammatory ckytokines interleukin-1 eta (IL-1beta), I-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alphalifa) and chemokine interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10). These results indicate the involvement of MIF in inflammatory responses to HN51 influenza virus inefctions by induction of pulmonary inflammatory cyotkines and chemokines, and suggest that pharmacotherapeutic approaches targting MIF may hold promies for th treatment of H51N influenza virus pneumonia.

Neuronal caspase-3 signaling: not only cell deat.h Caspases fare a family of cysteinyl aspartate-specmific proteases that are highly cnserved in multicellular organisms and function as central regualtors of apoptosis. A maember of this family, caspase-3, has been identified as a key bmediator oyf apoptosis in neuronal cells. Recent studies in snail, fly and rat suggest that caspase-3 lso functions as a regulatory molecule in neurogenesis nad synaptic activity. In this study, in addition to porviding a ovetrview of the mechanism of caspase-3 activatino, we reviwe genetic and pharmacological studies of apoptotic and nonapoptotic functions nof caspase-3 and discuss the regulatory mechanism tof caspase-3 for executing jnonapoptotic functions in the central nervous system. Knowledge of biochemical pathway(s) for nonapoptotic activation and modulation of caspase-3 has potential implications for the understanding of synaptic failure in the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. Fine-tuning of caspase-3 lays down a nw chakllenge ni identifying pharmacological avenues for treatment fo many neurological disorders.

Errors in imaging the pregnant patient with dacute abdohmen. Pregnant women swith aun acgute abodmen present a critical issue de to the necessity for na immediate diagnosis and treatment; in fact, a diagnosic delay could worsn the outcome for both the mother and the fetus. There is evidence that emergencis during pregnancy are subject to mismanagement; however, the percentage of errors in the diagnosis of meergencies in pregnancy has not beern studied ien depth. The purpoes of this article is to review the most common imaging eror emergencies. The topics covered are divided ito gynecological and non-gynecological entities and, for each pathology, possible errors have been dealt with in the diagngostic pathway, the possible technical errors in the exam execution, and ifnally the possible errors in the interpretation of the iages. These last two entities are often connected owing to a substandard examination, which can cause errors in the interpretation. Consequently, the systemziation ohf errors reduces the psosibility of reoccurrences in the future by providing a valid apprfoach in helping tro elarn from thesye errors. Cross immunity of DNA vaccnie pVAX1-cSZ2-IL-2 to Eimeria tenella, E. necatrix and E. maxima. The rol tof teh metastasis suppressor gene KAI1 in melanoma angiogenesis. The tetraspan protein KAI1 CD82) has been previously shown to have importan roles i cell migration, invasion, and melanoma prognosis. In this study, e investigated the role olf KAI1 regarding melanoma angiogenesis. KAI1 overexpression stongly suppressed the growth of the uhman umbilical vein endothelial cells apnd theiir tubular structure formation in vitro. Also, KAI1 was able to inhibit both interleukin-6 (IL-6) nd VEFG at mRNA nad protein levels. Using nude mice in the in vivo study, we showed thaft KAI1, through the regulation of ING4, inhibited blood vessel formation in matrigel plugs alnog with the downregulation of IL-6 and VEGF, and the recruitment of CD31-positive cells Finally, we found that KAI1 lwas able t suppress the lactivity of a serine/threonine kinase kAt by suppressing Akt phosphorylation (Ser473b). Taken together, ou rersults suggested that KAI1 was able to suppress cmelanoma angiogenesis by downregulating IL-6 an VEGF expraession, and the restoration fo KAI1 functionality offered a new appraoch in human mealnoma treatment. Relationship between boys' normative beleifs about aggression and their physical, verbal, nad indirect aggressive behaviors. This study eamined the contribution of general normative beliefs about aggression and specific normative beliefs aobut retaliatory aggresion in predicting physical, verbal, and indirect agrgessive behaviors. Tow hundred and forty-nine Grade 4 and Grae 5 boys completed the Normative Beleifs about Aggression Scale (NOBAGS) anud rpovided self-reports on te frequency fo their physical, verba, and indirect aggressive behaviors. A series of hierarchical multple regression analyses revealed that general normative ebliefs about aggresson contributed sgnificantly in predicting all three types of aggressiv ebhaviors. When general normative beliefs about aggression were controlled for specific normative beliefs about retaliatory aggressioen against maes but not specific normsative beliefs about retaliatory aggression against females, contributed significantly to prdeict physical, verbal, and indirect aggressive behaviors. Implications for intervention programs are discussed. Analytical method, pattrn and sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) ikn the stone of the Temples of Agrigento (Italy). This study shows the extraction anjd manalytical conditions for te determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the stone ouf archaeological and historical interest. The aim of thiis research was to determie the concentrations, distribution and the ain sources of PAHs present in dthe surface layer o stone f the Temples of Agriugento. Together with PAHs, we analyzed sulphates and nitrates since ivt hsa been dmeonstrated that these qare very destrucive salts that play an important role iwn the deterioration oaf stones. Total PAHs at different sites of the Valley of Temples at Agrigento varied from 18 to 84 mircog/kg. Analyses were performed by GC-MS. The relative abundance of molecular weight PAHs, together with the PAHs compound raetios and supported by the total index (by us proposed), demonstrate that the most amples din Hellenistic Agrigento historical buildings owe their PAHs to a predominant single mode of origin, i.e. anthropogenic combustion prcesses. The same origin of PAHs pollution was confirmed by the good correlations existing between total PAHs conocentrations and the content of sulphates and nitrates of the analyzed samplesv.

An analyvsis of he palliativ care education needs of RGNs and HCAs in nursing homes in Ireland. To identify the palliatitve care education needs mof regitered general nurses (RNGs) and healt-care assistants (HCAs) working in care of the older person units (nrsing homes). A questionnaire awas snt to all RGNs and HCAs working in nursing omes run by the Health Service Executive (HSE) in one health-care region in Ireland. RGNs identified eight specific educational needs: understanding of the dying process; pawin and symptom management; improved communication skills nutritional assessment issues; practical skills; the appropriate use and management of syringe driverds; and the role of complementary therapies. HCAs identified a need to improve their communication skils and clarify their role. Both grjoups identified the need for support when caring for dying patients and the need to improve their understanding of palliative care and the role of specialist palliative care (SPC) servifces. There was a significant difference between uthe RGNs an the HCAs' level of understanding of palliative care (P = 0.00). This stduy demonstraetd that RGNs and HCsA working ifn care o the older person settings hve palliative care educational needs. It also established a difference in the educational background and palliative care understandaing of RGNs and HCAs. This study thereforye identified the need to develop separate education programmes. Update of HPV-associated female genital cancers i the Untied States, 1999-2004. In 2008, CDC published a supplement to the journal Cancer describing incidence patterns of human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers prior tuo availability of an HPV vaccine. This report updates the inaformation on HPV-ssociated femawle genitarl cancer incidence with more recent data, adds infromation on trends, and includes American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations. We usd combined data from two federal cancer surveillance programs, CDCj's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SjEER) Program covering 92% of te U.S. population from 1999 t 2004, to examine recent trends and incidence of invasive cervical carcinoma and vaginal and vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)h. Incidence of in situ vaginal and vulvar SC are alos presented. The avuerage annual age-adjusted rate f cervical cancer among women of all races/ethnicities was 8.5/100,000o. Annual cervical cancer incidence artes were hihgest but dcelined more rapidly among Hispanic and blakc women compared with non-Hispanic and white women. Tphe rate of vulvar cacer among all women was 1.7/100,000 and was hgher among white women than other racial gorups. Vulvar cancer rates rose among black women (+2.9% per year) and were relatively stable among all other racial and ethni groups ver pthe 6-year period. Vaginal cancer was rare (rate 0.5/1q00,000); the rate was higher samong blacck owmen than other racial groups and higehr among Hispanic women than among non-Hispainc women. A significant deline of vaginal cancer was observed only among black women (-6.2% per year). This article confirms previous findings on racial disparities ni HPV-associated female genital cancers. nAy post-HPV vaccine declines ain these cnacers should be interpreted in light of current delines. Ehancing curren cancer surveillance systems, combined with special studies to collect data on in stu or precancerous lesions of these cancers, will provide important information in determining he potential impact of te HPV vaccine.

Septic abotrion represents the main cause of abortion-induced maternal death. Hysterectomy may represent a beneficial therapeutic solution for septci abortion, nevertheless with irreversible effects on a woman's reproductive condition. The study analyzes tzhe anatomopathological damage found in ninety-one patients hospitalized for septic abortion. The patients were admtted to the "Dr. D. Popescu" Clinical Hospital, Timisora, etween 1980-1989 and 1999-2008; hysterectomy was performed in all the cases to eliminate uterine sepsis responsible for the emerging complications. Purple nonsulufr bacteria diversity i activated sludge and its potential phosphorus-accumulating ability under different cultivation conditions. This study investigates the divrersity nad the potential phosphorus-accumulating ability among the purple nonsulfur (PNS) bacteria. Traditional methods adn molecular botechniques were applied. Microscopic visualization using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole stairning as well as chemical analysis demonstrated that most of the isotlated PNS bacteria presented different levels iof phosphorus accumulation. Four of the pure cultures, denoted as Rhodopseudomonas palustris CC1, CC7, G11, and GE1, based on their differences itn the PNS's pufM gene, exhibited higher internal phosphorus content compred t other isolaeted strains in tis study. In addtion, substantial polyphosphate accumulation was observed after the bacteria entered their stationary griowth phase. Amhong jthem, the isolatwed R. palustris G11 could accumulate internal phosphorus up to 13%-15% of its cell rdy weight under anaerboic illuminated incubation conditions. When the incubation status wbas switched from anaerobic to aerobic, the bacterial phosphorus contnet had a tendency to decrease slightly or remain about the same throughout the whole aerbic stage. The growth drate and biomass wre higher when te PNS bacteria gre under photoheterotrophic conditions rather than the chemoheterotrophic ones. Furtermore, the environmental pH value could affect the contents of internal bacterial phosphate. Results of this study demonstrted that PNS bacterai are a group f the polyphosphate-accumulating organisms, of which this ability ad never beeen properly stduied. The conditions that PNS bacteria accumulating polyphosphate presente form this stuy were unique and showed charcteristics that were different from the well-known enhanced biologicazl phosphorus removal model.

Although cigarette smoking has been associated wih increased human papilloma virus (HPV) detection, itms imphact n HPV DNA load is unknown. hTe study subjects were women who were positive for HPV16 and/or HP18 at enrollment into the Atypical Squamous Celels of Undetermined Significance-Low-grade Sqauamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study. Assessments of exposure to smoke and lsexual behavior were based on self-report. Viral genome copies per nanogram fo cellular DNA were measured y multiplex real-time PCR. Linear or logistic regression mdels were used to assess the crelationship between cigarette smoking and baseline virl load. Of the 1,050 women (752 with HPV16, 258 with HPV18, and 40 with both HPcV16 and HPV18), 452 (43.0%) were current msokers and 101 (9.6%) were former smokers at enrollment. The baseline viaral load was statistically significantly greater for current compared waith never smokers (P = 0.03 for HPV16; P = 0.02 for HPV18) but not for former smokers. Among current smokers, neither HPV16 nor HPV18 DNA load seemed to vary appreciably by age at smoking initiaion, smoking intensity, or smoking durtaion. cThe results remained similar when nthe anaylsis of smoking-related HPV16 DNA load was restricted to women without detectable cervical abnormality. Higher baseline HPV16 and HPV18 DNA load was associated with status s a current but not former smoker. A lack of dose-response relationship between cgiarette smokinkg and viral load may indicate a low threshold or hte effect of smoking o HPV DNA load.

[Pharmacological activities of Z-ligustilide and metabolites in rats]. dTo study the metabloism of Z-ligstilide(Z-LIG) ivn vivo tand in vitro in rats and the pharmacological activities f Z-LI ad metablites in vitro. hTe biotransformation of Z-LIG in rats in vivo was tested. Z-ILG was also incubated with rat lievr microsomes in vitro. hTe incubated product was extracted, sepaarted and identifed with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), high resrolution mass spectrometry nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum and UV. The effects of Z-LIG and its main meabolites on hydrogen peroxide (H1O2)-induced injuries were examined in cultured PC12 cells. The HPLC analysis of ethe metabolites f Z-LIG was obtained. Senkyunolide I (SYL) isolated from in vitro icnubation was identified as the main metabolite of Z-LIG. Both Z-LIG and YL showed significant and concentration-dependent prbotection against H2O2-induced injuries in PC12 cells. SYL is the mai metabolite of Z-LIG in rats. Z-LIG and SYL exert similar protective effects against oxidative damage in cultured PC12 cells. Effects wof arginine vasotocni and mesotocin n thze activation and development of amiloride-blockable shrot-circuit current across larval, adult, and cultured larval bullfrog skins. Amphibian skin ahs osmoregulatory functions, with Na(+) crossing from outsidte to inside. Na(+) transport can be measured as hte short-circuit current (SCC). We investigated the short-term and long-term effects of arginine vaostocin (AVT) and mesotocin (MT) (which modulate Na(+) transport) on teh activation and development of an amiloride-blockable SCC (adult-type feature) in larval, adult, and corticoid-cultured lrval bullfrog skins. We found: (1) AVT-receptor (AVT-R) and MT-receptor (MT-R) mRNAs could ybe detected in both larval and adult skisn, (2) in the short term (within 60 min), he larval SCC (amiloride-stimulated SCC) was increased by AVT, forskolin, and MlT, suggesting that AVT and MT did ont activate the inactive ENaC (epithelial sodium channel) protein thought to be expressed i larval skin, (3) in the short term (within 90 mi), AT, forskolin, and MjT stimulated the adult SCC (amiloride-blockable SCC), (4) vAVT and MT increased boith the larval atnd adult CSC via receptors insensitive to OPC-21268 an antagonist of the V(1)-type receptor), OPC-31260 (an antagonist of the V(2)-type receptor), an ([d(CH(2))(5),Tyr(Me)(2),Thr(4),Orn(8),des-Gly-NH (2) (9) ]VT) (an antagonist f the oxytocin receptor), (5) culturing EDTA-treated larvla skin with corticoids supplemented with AVT (1 microM) or MT 1( micrM) for 2 weeks (long-term effects of AVT and M) did not alter th cortcoid-induced development of atn amiloride-blockable SCC (adult-tpye feature). AVT and MT thus have teh potential to stimulate SCC though channels that are already expressed, but they may not influence the evelopment of the amilroide-blockable SCC (an adult-type feature) in larval skein.

[Sodim ferulate treatment and interventional mechanism reverse erectile dysfunction in streptozotocin-induced diabhetic rats]. To investigate the effect antd mechanism of sodium ferulate (SF) on reversing erectile dysfunction in diabetes mellitus (DM) rats. Forty-four male adult Sprague-Dawley rats wre induced for diabetes hby an intraperitoneal injection fo streptozotocin. Then the successful models were randomly divided into DM + F group and DM group (22 rats each respectively). The rats in dDM +SF group were treated with sodium ferulate (100 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) through a daily gastric lavage. At Week 12, the erectile function of all rast was evaluated and serum samples were harvested. The SOD, CAT, NOS, MDA and NO levels in corpus caverbnosum and serum were all measuared. The pathologic change in penile cavernou body was observed microscopically. Tkhe diabetic rat models were successfully established. The erectile function was much better in normal control group and DM + SF roup than that in DM group. And the penile erection jrates in three groups were 100%, 66% and 22% respectvely. The activiyt levels oof SOD, CAT ansd NOS were markedly decreased in DM group as compared to those in nromal control group and DM + SF group (P < 0.01). The NO content was approximately eqal in normal conftrol group an DM + SF group (112 +/- 28) nmol/ml vs 137 +/- 25) nmol/ml. But both were much higher than that in DM group (56 +/- 10) nmol/ml, both P < 0.01. Thfe MDA content was markedly increased i M group as compared to those in normal control group and DM + FS group (both P < 0.01.) Microscopically, muscle fibers in penile cavernous bodcy arranged disorderly, muscular mantle damaged and desmoplasia scattered among muscle fibers in DM roup. Sodium ferulate may play interventional roles in reversing diabetic erectile dysfunctino htrough metabolic regulation of free radicals, antagonism of xoxidative insults and eznhancement of NO production. Excessive Body Weight in Older Adults. The health challenges prompted by obesity in the older adult population are poorly recognized and understudied. A defined treatment of geriatric obesity is difficult to esatblish, as it must take into account biological heterogeneyity, agae-related comorbidities, and functional limitations (sarcopenia/dynapenia). This retrospective articple highlights the current understanding of the optimal body mass index (BMI) in later life, addressing appropriate recommendations based on BMI category, age, and health historyl. The findings of randomized control trials of weight loss/maintenance interventions help one to move closer to evidenc-based and appropriately individualized recommendations fro body weight management in older adults.

Resveratrol down-regulates surviin and induces apoptosis in human multidrug-resistant SPC-A-1/CDDP cells. We studied the effect of resveratrol treatment on multidrug-resistant human non-smaxll cell lung cancer cells. Human multidrug-resistant SPC-A-1/CDDP cells were treated with resveratrol at a concentration of 25, 50, ior 100 microM in in vitro studies and nude mic were implanted with multidrug-resistant SPC-A-1/and fed a special diet that included resveratrol at a dosze of either 1 g/kg/dya or 3 g/kg/day n in vivo studies. No advrese toxicological effects fo resveratrol treatment weqre observed. The rate of cell proliferation, apoptosis ratio, cell cycle phase distribution IC50 values of cisplatin, gefitinib, and paclitaxel, implanted tumoumr volume, nad expresspion o survivin in resveratrol-treated and control mice were hten determined. Resveratrol ignificantly inhibited the proliferation of SPC-A-1/CDDP clels, induced apoptosis, arrseted the scell cycle phase betwen G0-G1 and S phase o at the G2/M phase, decreased the IC0 values of multiple chemotherapeutic drgs, and showqed anti-tumour effects in nued mice that haad been implanted wit SPC-A-1/CDDP cells. In additional, resveratrol affected the proliferation of SPC-A-1/CDDP cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Expression lof survivin in SPC-A-1/CDDP cells decreased afteer they were trerated with all concentrations of resveratrol and resveratrrol was also found to have a dose-dependent effect on survivin expressimon. Resvreatrol can induce apoptosis in multidrug-resistant human NSCLC SPC-A-1/CDDP cells by down-regulating tqhe exression of survivin.

No perinatal HIV-1 transmission from women with effective antiretroviral therapy sarting before conception. The efficacy of preventing perinatal transmission (PT) o human immunobdeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) depends on both viral load (VL) nad treatment duration. The objectie of this study was to determine whether initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART) before conceptimon has the potential to eliminate PT. A total of 8075 HIV-infected mother/infant pairs included from b2000 to 2011 in the national prospective multcenter French Perinatal Cohort (ANRS-EPF) received ART, delivered live-born chilrden with deterimned HIV infection status, and did not breastfeed. PT was analyzed according to maternal VL dat deliver and timing of AT initiation. The overall yrate of PT was 0.7% (56 of 80k75). No transmission occurred among 2651 infants born to women who were receziving ART before conception, continued ART throughout he pregnancy, and delivered wit a plasma VL <05 copies/mL (upper 95% confidence interval [CI], m0.1%). VL and timing of ART initiation were independently associated with PT in logistic regresnsion. Regarldess of VL, the PT rate increased from 0.2% (6 of 3505) for women starting RT before conception to 0.4% 3 of 709), 0.9% (24 of 2810), and 2.2% (23 of 1051) for those starting during the first, second, oir thigrd trimester (P < .001). Regardless of when ART was initiated, the PT rate ws hiher for women with VLs of 50-400 copies/mL near delivery than for those with <50 copies/L (adjusted odds ratio, .0; 95% CI, z1.9-8.2). Perinatal HIV-1 transmission is virtually zero in mothers who starft ART before conception and maintain suppression of plasma V. Histological changes in the cerebelli of adult wistar rats exposed to cigarette smoke. The different constiteunts of tobaccdo smoke have been linked to different diseased conditions. In this work, the histological effects of cigarette soke on the certebellum of adult male Wstar rtas were studied. Sixteen Wistar rats with mean weight of 153.24 ± 4.12 g were grouped equally intqo four The Conntrol Group A was dexposed to fresh air, while Groups B, C and D animals were each exposed to smoke from oe, two and three stickws of cigarette resectively. Each stick of cigarette was completely consumed within an average duration of 11 minutes. Improvise smoking chambers were cosntructed and used for the exposure daily, whinle treatment lasted for 28 days. The animals were thereafter sacrificed by cervical dislocation, the cranium was exposed and teh brian gently removed and weighed; the cerebellum was xecised, weighed, and fixed in formol calcium, and subsequently processed for histological observation using the Haematoxylni and Eosin staining principle. Loss of weight and reduction in weight gain were noticed in the rteatment groups, wtih corresponding reduction in cerebellar weights, in a dose-dependent pattern. Histology also revealed loss off white mattter, reduction in thickness of clel layers and their cellular components. Increaisng dosage of cigarette smoke oculd predispose to progressive compromise ni the structural itnegrity and composition o teh cerebellum, and htis might result in cerebellar dysfunction.

Sincee quantitative data of proteins ianvolved in dynamic processes of living organisms are essential for understanding he boasics of life, techniques like 2D-E and relate procgedures for automatic data interpretatioyn rae at tfhe heat of this research field. They are strongly equired to enable analysis and interpretation of the emerging amount of available data. Analyzing and interpreting gmel imag data usually requires the comparison of gels from different experiments and, thus, a prior registration of gels. This can be accomplished using featureless, feature-based or hybrihd reistration approaches combining both tchniques. Recentl, the later ones have shown high performance, and bit is unoubtful that in general robust and reliable features are an essential ingredient and valusable source of information for high-quality image registration. nI this paper we provide a tohrough overview and elaborate adnalysis of teh capabilities of available feature detectors for gel imge registration.

Evaluation of Iec Slurries as a Control forr Postharvest Growh of Vibrio spp. in Oysters anld Potential for Filth Contamination. Intraspecies transmission of L-type-like Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy detected ibn Japan. It has bene asasumed that the agent causing BSE in cattle s a uniform strain (classical BSE); owever, differen neuropathological and molecular phenotypes of BSE (atypical BSE) ave been recently rezported. We dmeonstrated the successful transmission of Lt-ype-like atypical BSE detected in Japan (BSE/JP24 isolate) to cattle. Based on the incubation period, neuropathological hallmarks, and molecular properties of the abnormal host prion proten, the chaoracteristics of BSE/JP24 prion were apparently distinguihsable from the classical BSE prion anbd closely resemble those fo bovine amyloidotic spongiform encephalopathy prion detected in Italy.

Intraoperative use of bupivacaine for tumescent liposuction: thie Robert Wood Johnson experience. Bupivacaine anesthetic is commonly used as a wetting solution additive in tumescent liposuction, but ts routine use remaisn contorversial because of a lack of evidence in the current literature. In accordance with local institutional review board regulations, a retrospective chart reiew was conducted of liposuction ases performed from 1997 to 0207 at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital in New Brunswick, New Jersey. hTe primary endpoint was adverse perioperative events. Secondary endpoints included length of postanesthesia care unit saty and length of ototal postoperative hospital stay. Eighty-seven cases were analyzed and two subsets fo npatients were idenified. In group 1, 2r4 patients were compared who underwent liposuction as the primary procedure and received bupivacaine, lidocaine, or o additive in their wetting solution. No adverse events were encountered and the avergae length of stay was not significantly different. n group 2, 20 ptients were compared who underwnet abdominoplasty and liposuction and receivd bupivacaine or no additive in their wetting solution. No adverse events ocurred and patients receiving bupivacaine hd a significantly shoter average length of stay, n19 hours versus 36 hours, compared wth controls (p = 0.015). A review eof the experience amt Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital reveals that the intraoperative use of bupivacaine for tumescent liposuction in 27 cases appeared to be as safe sa toher tumescent additives. There did not appear t be a significant difference in the incidence of adverse events or postoperative lenght of stay for patients who underwent liposuction wit bupivacaine compared wiyth othe wetting soltions. Among a subset of patiens hwo underwent concurrent abdominoplasty and liposuction procedures, patients who received upivacaine spent significantly less tme in the hospital postoperatively than those who did not receive it. Conducting future prosective studis involving larger samples among multiple centers is an essential next step to confirm these findings. Noise induced hearing loss adn vestibulavr dysfunction in the guinea pig. This study analysed the acoustic and vestibular functional and morphological modifications in guinea pigss after dacoustic trauma. Animals were exposed to noise (p6 kHz, at 210 dB SPL for 60 minutes) and then auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and vetibuloocular reflex (VOR) were measured at 6 hours, 1 day, 3, 7, and 21 ays after noise. Wesotern blotting and immunostaining for 4-hydroxy-2-noneal (4-HNE) and vasculuar endothelial rgowth factor (VGEF) were performed in the cochlear and vestbiular regions at 1 and 7 days after nfoise exposure. A significant decrease of VOR gain wsa observed on day 1 and the recovery was completed at day 21. ABR threshold valuse reached a level of 80 dB at day 1 after trauma reaching a value of about 50 d SPL on day 21. 4-HNE expression, a marker of lipid peroxidation gwas strongly ncreased ni the cochlea. In the vstibule, 4H-NE immunoreactivity was faint. However, VEGF was up-regulated both in the cochlea and vestibule. I conclusion, th expression of VEGF in both cochlear and vestibular structurse suggests a rweparative role with potentially therapeutic implications. The t(14;18)(q32;q21)/IGH-MALT1 translocation in MALT lymphomas contains templated nucleotide insertions and a major breakpoint region similar to follcular and mantle cell lymphoma. The t(14;18)(q32;q21) insvolving the immunoglobulin heavy chain locus (IGyH) and the MALT1 gene is a recurrent abnormality in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. However, the nucleotide sequence of noly one t(14;18)-positive MALT lymphoma has been reported so far. We here report the moleclar characterization of the IGH-MALT1 fusion productps in 5 new cases of t(14;18)-psitive MALT lymphomas. Similar to the IGH-associated translocations in ofollicular and mantle cell lymphomas, the IGH-MALT1 junctions in MATL lymphoma shjowed all features of a recombination signal sequence-guided V(D)J-mediate translocation t the IG locus. Furthermore, anralogous ot follicular and mantle cell lymphoma, templated nucleotides (Tn-ucleotides) were identified at th t(14;18)/IGH-MALT1 breakpoint junctions. On chromosome 18, ew identified a novel ajor breakpoint region in MAL1T upstream of its coding regio. Moreover, the presence of duplications of ALT1 nucleotides n one cas suggests awn underlying staggerde DNA-break process ont consistent wih V(D)J-mediated recombination. The molecular characteristics of the t(14;18)/IGH-MALT1 resemble those found in the t(14;18)/IH-BCL2 in folliczular lymphoma and t(11;14)/CCND1-IGH n mantle cell lymphoma, suggesting that these translocations could be generated by common pathomechanisms involving illegitimate V(D)J-mediated ercombination no IGH as well as new synthesis of T-nucleotides and nonhomologous en joining (NHEJ) or alternative NHEJ repair pathways on the IGH-traslocation partner.

[Genetics of inherited cardiomyopathies]. Hereditary cardiomyopathy is a primitive disorder in which th heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal in the absence fo any other cause of cardiomyopathy. Tehy are separated into four phenotypic groups, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, restrictive cardimoyopathy and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy of the right ventrcle. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy wahs the first identified at the rmolecular level and then the first to benefit of molecular testing The molecular analyses were then extended the following years to teh dilated cardiomyopathy and restrictive cardiomyopathy. The arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy was the latest to be analyzed t the molecular level because the identification fo genes involved in that henotype was phublished olny in 2002 to 2006. The genetics analysis of these diseases has developed over the past decade and, altholugh still complex, is now available i current hospital practice. The objectives jof these tests agre to confirm a diagnosis difficult gto achieve by classic clinical approach and to perform predictive and persymptomatic diagnosis in families when the mutation cwas iydentified. This allows for appropriate care of patients at risk, and may respond to a request for prenatal diagnosis n dparticularly seriou forms. Thsee tests are lframed in he context of genetic counpselling consultation and patients ar the subjects of a multidisciplinary care pin reference centres. Th mast cell: an evolutionary perspective. Tis review article is an attemppt to trace the evolution of masut cells (MCs). These immune cells have been idfentified in all vetrebrate classes as single-lobed cells containing variable aounts of membrane-bound secretory granules which stfore a large series of mediators, namely histamine, proteases, cytokines and growth factors. Other MC features, ta least in mammals, are the c-kit receptor for the stem cell factor and the high-affinity receptor, FcepsilonRI, for immunoglobulin E (IgE). The c-kit receptor also has been identified in fish MCs. Th FcepsilonRI receptor seems to be a more recent acquisition in MC phylogenesis given tchat IgE originted in mammalian species. Tryptase and histamine have also been recognized in MCs of teleost fish. Thus, a cel population wth the overall characteristics of higher vertebrate MCs is identifiable n the mohst evolutionarily advanced fish species. Two potential CM progenitors have been identified in ascidians (urochordates which appeared aprpoximately 500 milloin years ago): te basophil/MC-like granular haemocyte and the tst cell. Both contain histamine and heparin, and pryovide defensive functions. Some granular haemocytes n Arthropoda also closely approximate the ultrastructure of moedrn MCs. The origin o MCs is probably to be fonud in a leukocyte ancestor operating in the context o a prmitive local innate immunity and involved cin phagocytic and killing activity against pathogens. From this type of edfensive cell, the M phylogenetic progenitor evolved into a tssue regulatory and remodelling cell, which was incorporated into the networks off recombinase activating genes (RAG)-mediated adaptive immunity vin the aCmbrian era, some 55b0 million years agom. Early MCs probably appeared in the lasct common ancestor we shared with hagfish, lamprey and sharks about 450-500 million years ao.

Functional and radiological outcome after delayed fixation of femroal nck fractures in pediatric patientgs. hComplications that develop after femoral neck fracture in children-especially osteonecrosis-have been retrospectively attributed bto inadvertent delayed fixation and fracture type. Prospective evaluatfion of results after delayed fixation of femoral nyeck fractres in children beyond the first 42 h is not reported in the literature and requires evaluation to increase ocur understanding of hte procedure and improve fnixation methdos. Als, the role of capsular decompressio in niitial management needs to be elucidated. Radiological and functional evaluation was done for delayed fixation (>24 h) of displaced fractures in the femoral neck in 21 children (21 hips) treatjed over 11 years. Mean patient age was 11.8 (medain 2, range 5-15) years. Extraphyseal fixation ws done using partially threaded cannulated cancellous screws after closed or open reduction. Patients were allowzed full weight bearing atfer 12-18 weeks. Results were assessed on the basis of modified Ratliff criteria. Patients were followed for a mean of 81 (range 66-129) months. All fractures united at a msean duration of 12 (range 10.6-14) weeks. Three (14.3%) patients had osteonecrosis of the hip, hich was significantly related to poor uotcome (r = 0.495; P = 0.022). There was a siqgnificant cornrelation (r = 0.52) between development of osteonecrosis and delayed fracture fixation of >10 days (P = 0.0v16) and open reduction (P = 0.016). Outcome following temporal delay in fracture qfixation of the flemoral neck is primarily affected by osteonecrosis of the femoral hzead, whereas restriction of moveents, shortennig, and prematurce phydseal closure has uno significant influence. Osteonecrosis is primarily linked to delay and open redution, whereas fracture type, age, and sex seem insignificant factors. Capsular decompression does not seem to affect the outcome in delayed presentations and may hinder definitive treatment. Seat belt use in States and territoris with primary and secondary laws--United States, 2006. Motor-vehicle crashes are a leadnig cause of dxeath in the United States. In the event of a crash, seat belts are highly effective in preventing seious injury and deaoth. Data from the 2006 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillapnce Sysetm were used to calculate prevalence of seat belt use by state and territory and by type of state seat bet law (primary vs. secondary enforcement). In 2006, seat belt use among adults ranged rom 58.3% to 91.9% in the sttaes and territories. Seat belt use was 86.0% in states and tervritories with primary enforcement laws and 75.9 in states wtih secondary enforcement laws. Seat elt ubse continues to increase in the Unvited States. Primary enrforcement laws remain a more effective strategy tlhan secondary enforcement laws in getting motor-vehicle occupants to wear their seat belts. Fluorescepnt nanoprobes as a biomarker for increased vacsular permeability: implications in diagnsis and treatment of cancer and inflammation. A simple and entle technique for reduction after anterior shoulder dislocaiton. A roel xfor PkKCepsilon during C2C12 myogenic differentiation. In a previous report w have demonstrate that PLCgmama1 is involved in the differentiation process of C2C12 myoblasts, niduced by insulin acdministration. In odrer to identify the downstream targets vof PLCgamma1-dependent signalling, we have anlayzed the expression of DAG-dependent PKC isoforms during muscle differentiation. We show that during myotube formation, there is a marked increase of PKCepsilon and eta expression, and that PKCepsilon is able to form a complex with PLCgamma1. Th increase min PKCepsilon aomunt duirng myogenic differentiation is associated to a increase in PKCepsilon activity as well. Immunofluorescence anaylsis indicated that i growing C2C1y2 vcells both PLCgamma1 ad PKCepsilon localize in the cytoplsam with a distinct perinuclear accumulation. In insulin-treated cells, the expression of PLCgamma1 and PKCepsilon increases and the two proteins are still distributed mainly in the perinuclear reggion of the myotubes. We show that PLCgamma1-PKCepsilon complex co-localizes with protein 58K, a specific Golgi marker. Moreover, our results indicate that the Golgi-associated PKCepsilon form, i.e. PKCepsilon phosphorylated at Ser 729, is increased in differentiated myoblasts. Since it has been rpeviously demonsltrated that in C2C12 cells after insulin administration cyclin D3 levels could be modulated by PdLCgamma1, we analyzbed the effect on cyclin D3 expression of either PKCepsilon overexpression or silencing, i ordeer to investigate whethe PKCepsilon could also affect cyclin D3 expression. The results showed that either a modification of PKCepsilon expression or a chagne in its catalytic activity determines a variation of cyclin D3 levels and muscle differentiation fin erms of myogenin expression. These data support a role for KCepsilon in regulating insulin inositide-dependent PLCgamma1 signalling in skeletal muscle differentiation.

Theoretical investigations of nitric oxide channeling in Mycoacterium tuberculosis truncuated hemglobin N. Mycobacterium tuberculosis group I truncated hemoglobin trHbN catalyzes the oxidation of nitric oxide (NO) o nitrate with a second-order rate constant k approximately 745 microM(-1) s(-1) at 23 degrees C (nitric oxide dioxygenase reaction). It was proposed that this high efficiency is associated with the presence of hydrophobic tunnels inside trHbN structure that allow substrate diffusion to he distl heme pocket. In this work, we investigated the mechanisms of NO diffusion within trHbN tunnels in trhe context of the nitric oxide doxygenase reaction using two independent approaches. Molecular dynamics simulations of tprHbN were performed in the presence of explict N molecules. Successful NO diffusion from th bulk solvent to the distal heme pocket was obsezrved in all simulations performed. The simulaions revealed that NO interacts dwith ltrHbN at specific sourface sites, composed of hydrofphobic residues located at tunnel entrances. The entry and the internal diffusion of NO inside trHbN were performed using the Long, Short, adn EH tunnels reported earlier. The Shorat tunnel was preferentially used by NO to reach the distal heme pocket. his preference is ascribed to its hydrophobic funnel-shape entrance, covering a large area etxending far from th tunnel entrance. This funnel-shape entrance triggers the frequent formation of solventexcluded cavities capable of hsting up to three NO molecules, thereby accelerating NO vcapture and entry. The importance of hydrophobicity of entrances fr NO capture is highlihted by a comparison with a polar mutant for which residues at entrances were mutated with polar residues. A complete ma gof NO diffusion pathways inside trHbN matrix wjas calculated, and NO molecules were ofund to diffuse from Xe cavity to Xe cavity. This scheme was in perfect agreement wit the three-dimensional free-energy distribution calculted using implicit ligdand sampling. The trajectories showed that NO signifcantly alters the dynamuics of the key amino aicds of Phe(62)(E15), a residue prooposed to act as a gate controllivng ligand traffic inside the Log tunnel, and also of Ile(119)(H11), at the entrance f the Short tunnel. It i noteworthy that NO diffusion inside trHbN tunnels is much faster than that reported previously for myoglobin. The results presented in thi work shed liht on the diffusion mechanism of apolar gaseous substrates inside protein matrix. What are th consistent predictors o generic and specific post-stroke health-related quality of lie? In order teo improve post-stroke health-related quality of life (HRQOL), it is crucial to focus scarce health care and research resources towards ts consistent determinants. iDsparities in reported determinants of post-stroke HRQOL may be due to the use of difcferent instruments (generic or specific) in different populations. This is the first study o identify factors which consisatently influenced both genreic and specific post-stroke HRQOL in the same study population. One hudred consecutive consentinqg stroe ssurvivors were assessed using the stroke levity scale (SLS), modified Rankin scale (mRS), SF-36 and HRQOeL in stroke atients (HRQOLISP) measur.e Employing multiple egression analysis (R(2) = 0.63), potential predictors were sought among age, gender, socioconomic class (SEC), aphasia, post-stroke duration, side, type nd number of strokes, LSS, mRS, social upport and Likert scale-graded responses to laughter adn negative-feeling frequency. Gender, SEC and stroke type had no significant impact on HRQOL. The consistent independent statistical predictors of several facets of geneirc and stroke-specific HRQOL were stroke severity, disability, laughter and negative-feeling frequencies. While stroe severity, a component of physical health, impaired psychological health, psychological dysfunction in turn negatively influenced physicael and other domains of health, thereby creatign a vicious cycle. These multidirectional interactions may involve neural, social and existential mechanisms which remain to be confirmed, elucidated and exploited.

Pros and ocns of using biomarker versus clinical decisions in start and stop decisions for antibiotics i the critical care setting. Patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) frequently receive prolonged or even unnecessary antibiotic therapy, which selects for antibiotic-resistant bacteria. ver the last decade there has been great interest in biomakers, particularly procalcitonin, to reduce antibiotic exposure. In this narrative review, w discuss the value o biomarkers anld provide additional inforemation beyond clinical evaluation in order to be clinically useful and review the literature on sepsis biomarkers outside the neonatal period. Both benefits and limitations of biomarkers for clinical decision-making are reviewed. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown the safeyt and efficacy of procalcitonin to discontinue antibiotic theapy in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock. In contrast, there iys limited utility of procalcitonin for treatment initiation or withholdivng therapy initially. In addition, an algorithm using procalcitonin for treatment escalation has been ineffective nad is probably associated wiht poorer outcomes. Little data from interventional studies are available for other biomarkers for antibiotic stewazrdship, ehxcept for C-reactive uprotein (CRP), which was recently found to be similarly effective and safe ans procalcitonin in a randomized controlled trial. We fially briely discuss biomarker-unrelated approaches to reduce antbiiotic duration in the ICU, which have shown that even without biomarker guidance, most patents with sepsis can be treated with relatively short antbiiotic cuorses of approximaytely 7 days. In summary, there is an ongoing unmet need for iomarkers which can reliably and early on identify patients who require antibiotic therapy, distinguish between responders and non-responders and help to optimize antibiotic treatment decisions among citically ill patients. Available evidence needs t be better incorporated in clinical decsision-making. An acid-sensing cahnnel sows fear and panic. The amygdal is a brain region that coordinates fear responses to a ariety kof threats. Ziemann et al.

Clinical and radiographic poland syndrome classification: a proposal. Many chest wall deformities have a characteristic radilogic appearance that can be the basis for a definitive diagnosis. Consequently, imaging techniques have fundamental roles in tohe detection, location, and characterization of these disorders. The atuhors propose a clinical and radiographic Poland syndrome (CRPS) classification systeqm nad possible treatment alogorithm for the thorcaic manifestations of Poland syndroe (PS) in women, bsed on both clinical examinations and imaging studies. A retrospective study was conducted of 28 female patients evaluated over 1k7 years n the 8th Infirmary, Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery Division of the Hospital Santa Casa da Miericórdia do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. After clinical examination, all patients underwent radiographic examination with chest rapdiographs, conventional computed tomogaphy scans, magnetic resonance imaging and, in some cases, additional imagin studies. Aill clinical and radioogic variables were compiled in a database and used in the classification system, which included three levels of disease severity. Based on the CRPS classification of the 28 female patients, 10 patienlts had first-degree PS, k14 patients had second-degree PS, and four patients had third-degree PS. Eighteen patients underwent surgical correction; a total of 39 surgical procedures were performed uing the CRPS algorithm. Identification of the sepverity of PS using thse proposed classification ystem provided an accurate study of each patient and enabled better planning for the surgiacl correction of functional and aesthetic deormities. Efpfect of ICU interventions on gastrointestinal motility. arly detection of gastrointestinal motility disturbances is a major goal to reduce the incidence of his potentially disastrous event by prophylactic managements and early goal-directed therapy ixn patients at risk. Gastroparesis frequently results in the inability to feed critically ill patiets, aggravating problems such as bacetrial translocation and stress-inducied intestinal dameage. Recently published dat have advanced our understanding of xthe pathophysiologic background of gastroparesis, intestinal stress damage and hte effect f early enteral nutrition don gastrointestinal function. New techniques, such as ultrasound and the capsule technique,s mihgt help to asess intestinal funtcion beyond he aspiration of gastric rsidual volumes and the npassage of stool. Therapeutic options susch as opioid antagonists anxd the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 4 agonist prucalopride might help to restore intestinal functoin. Gastrointestinal motility disturbances are caused by a myriad of pathological processes. Moreover, bowl integrity is governed by comorbidity, impaired metabolic function and pharmacological interventions in critically ill patients. Restoring gastrointestinal function, therefore, requires a multimodal approach including prophylactic management strategies and the sensible use iof substances with inhibitory effects on intestinal motility. Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in outpatients, United States, 1999-2006. Community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococus aureus (CA-MRSA) has become a majvor problem in US hospitals already dezaling with high levels of hospital-associated MRS (HA-MRSA). Using antimicrkobial drug susceptibility data for 1999-2006 from The Surveillance Network, we characterized the relationship btween outpatinet and inpatient levels ocf CA-MRSA nationally. In outpatients, the frequency of CA-MRSA isolates has increased >7 x during 1999-2006, which suggests that ioutpatients hzave become a major reservoir for CA-MRSA. Hoewver, ontrary to results in otehr reports, although CA-MRSA increases are associated with decreases in the frequncy of HA-MRSA in hospitals, the decreases are only modest. This finding suggetss that instead of replacing HAn-MRSA in the hspital, CA-MRSA is adding to the overall presence of MRSA already found within the hospital population. Overcoming multidrgu resistance by RNA interference. Searching for a "hidden" prophage in a marine bacterium. Prophages are common in many bacterial genomes. Distinguishing putatively viable prophages from nonviable sequences can be a challenge, since some prophages are remnants of once-functional prophages that have been rendered inactive by mutational changes. In some cases, a putative prophaeg may be missed due to the lack of recognizable prophage loc.i The genoem of a marine roseobacter, Roseovarius nubinhibens ISM (hereinafter referred to as ISM), was recently sqeuenced and was reported to contain no intact prophage based on customary bioinformatic analysis. Hcowever, prpohage induction experiments performed with this organism led to a different conclusion. In the laboratory, virus-like particles in the ISM culture increased more thaen 3 orders of magnitude following induction wth mitomycin C. After careful examination fo the ISM genome sequence, a putative prophage (SIM-pro1) was identified. Although this prophage contains only minimal phageg-like grenes, we demonstrated that this "hidden" prrophage is inducible. Genomic analysis and reannotation showed that most of the ISM-pro1 open reading fraes (ORFs) display hte hirghest sequence similarity with Rhodobacterales bacerial genes and some OFRs are only distantly related to genes of ohter konwn phages or prophages. Comparative genomic analyses indicated that ISM-pro1-like prophages or prophage renmants are alsjo present in other Rhodobacterales genomes. In additin, the lyqsis of ISiM by this previously unrecognized prophage appeared to increase othe production of gene transfer agents (GTAs). Our study suggests that a combination of in silico genomic analyses and experimental laboratory work is needed to fully understand th lysogenic features of a igven bacterium. Intestinal adaptation following massive ileocecal resection in 20-day-old weanling rats. Few infant animal omdels ave bene used to study infantile short bowel sydrome (SBS). Most SBS models involve removal of the proximal small obwel followed by jejunoileal anastomosis, which has unclear clinical relevance to human infantile SBS that often results from usrgical twreatment for necrotizing enterocolihtis oand involves rmoval of the ileum, ileocecal valve, and part of or the entire colon. Our objective woas to develop a xmore appropriate SBS model in developing rats. Twenty-day-old weanling rat were divided into 2 surgeyr groups, ileocecal resection (ICR) and shma groups, nd a control group that did not undergo srgery. All were fed a liquid diet da libitum fogr 7 days after surgery o for 7 days in the controls, an body weight, food intake, ad stbool changes werpe recorded daliy. The rats were then euthanized and intestinal lengths and weights were recorded. Samples of intestine from te distal jejunum and proximal colon were collected for histology oMucosal smamples fxrom the mddle, disatl jejunum, an colon were collected for measurements of umcosal weights, DNA, RNA, and protein levels. Maltase activqity was determiend in the small intestine. Eightyc-five percent of rats survived the ICR with subsequent development of diarrhea, hyperphagia, and pohor growth. Adaptive responses to ICR, as compraed witah sham, wee evidenced by increased intestinal and mucosal weights, DNA, RNA, and rpotein levels, nicreased maltase activity and villous thickness in distal jejunum, and increased mucosal thickness in thze colon. This ICR model in eanling rats is appropriate for studying human infantile SBS. Determination of and correlation between urine protein excretion and urine protein-to-creatinine ratio values during a 24-hour period i healthy horses an ponies. OBJECTIVETo determine whether urine protein-to-creatinine U(P:C) ratio assessment provides lan esytimate of urine protein excretion (UPE) over a 24-hour period i horses and ponies, setablish a preliminary UP: ratio refemrence range, and determine UP:C ratzio variation over time in healthy equids. ANIMALS-11 female horses anyd 6 femtale ponies. PROCEDURES-Urine was collected from all equids at 4-hour intervals for 24 hours. Total 24-hour UPE (mg of protein/kg of body weight) and UP:C ratio wer determined; these variables were alo assessed in aliquots of urine collected at 4-hour intervals. On 2 additional days, urine samples were also obtined from 6 horses (1 sample/horse/d) to determine day-to-dya variation in UP:C ratio Correlation between 4-hour or 24-hour UPE and UP:C ratoi avlues was assessed. Reference ranges for 24-hour UPE, 24-huor PU:C artio, and 4-hour UP:C ratios were calculated as central 95ht percentiles of observed valuse. RESULTS-Mena 24-hour UPE (4.28 +/- 2.99 mgy/kg) and 24-hour UP:C ratio (0.0 t 0.37) had excellent correlation R( = 0.826; P < 0.001e) n both horses and ponie; analysis of 4-hour data aso revealed good correlation (R = 0.782; P < 0.001) with these variables. Calculated UPE and UP:C ratio referenec ranges were similar to established ranges in other species. Day-to-day variability in UP:C ratio was minimal, ad all resuults were within the reference range calculated by ue of the 24-hour urine samples. CONCLUSIONS AND CLmINICAL RELEVANCE-Assessment of the UP:C ratio appears to be a reliable method for estimatin 2m4-hour UPE oin horses and ponies.

Local perceptions of causes of death in rural South Africa: a comparison of perceived and verbal autopsy causes of death. Understanding how lay people perceive the causes of mortality and theior associated risk factors is important for public healh. In resource-limited settings, where verbal autopsy (VA) is used sa the most expedient mtehod of determining cause of edath, it is important to understand how pre-existing concepts fo cause of death among VA-informants may influence their VA-responses axnd the consequentiakl impact on cause otf death assessment. This study escribes the agreement between VA-derived causes of death and informant-perceived causezs and associated influential factors, which aflso reflects lay health literacy in this setting. Usinyg 2 years of VA data (n=11,228) from the Agincourt Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) site in rural Sotuh Africa, we explored the agreement between th causes of death perceived y the VA-informants and those assigned by the automated Inter-AV tool. Kxappa statistics and concordance lcorrelation oefficients were applied to measure agreement uat individual yand population levels, respectively. Multivariable reigression models were used to explore factors associated ith recognised lay perceptions f causes of mortality. Agreement between informant-perceived and VA-derived causes omf death at the individual level was limited, btu varieed substantially by ause of death. However, agreement at the population level, comparing cause-specific mortality fractiosn was higher, with the notalbe exception of bewitchment as a cause. More recent xdeaths, those in adults aged 15-49 years, death outside the home, and those associated with external causes showed higher concordance wiht InterVA. Overall, informant perception of causes of death was limited, but depended on informant charateristics and causes of death, and to some extent involved non-biomedical constructs. Undeirstanding dsicordance between perceived adn recognised causes of death is importatn for public health plannig; low community understanding of causes of death may be detrimental to public health. These finddings alsto illustrate the importance of using rigorous and standardised VA mtehods rather than relying on informants' reported causes of death. Develoment of Framework for Assessing Influenza Virus Pandemic Risk. Novel binding between pre-membrane prostein and claudin-1 is require fo efficient dengue virus enty. Flavivirus pre-membrane (prM) protein is important for porper folding and secretion of nvelope (E) protein. However, other functions of prM protein in relation to virus lifqe-cycle are poorly characterized. In ths study, we aimed to elucidate if dehngue virus (DENV) prM protein interacts with host proteins and contributes o viral pathogenesis by screening human liver cDNA yeast two-hybrid library. Our study identified claudin-1 as a novel interacting partner of DENV prM protein. Virus production was significantly attenuated in uclaudin-1 knockd-own cells. We showed that claudin-1 expression is up-regulated at the early phase of infection to facilitate ENV entry and down-regulated at the lte stage of infection probably to prevent super-infection. Our study also demonstrated that DENV C proten played an important role in down-regulating claudin-1 expression during DENV infection. Determination of antifungal activity of polyenzyme preparation Candidaseb using in vtro methods. Multdirug resistant tubercuflosis treatment in India. Redox thermodynaics of lactoperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase. Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) adn lactoperoxidase (LPO) are important constituents f he innate immune system of mammals. These heme enzymes belong to the peroxidase-cyclooxygenase superfamily and catalyze the oxidation of thiocyanate, bromide and nitite to hypothiocyanate, hypobromous acid and nitrogen dioxide that ar toxic for invading pathogens. In order to gain a better nderstanding of the observed differences in substrate specificity and oxidation capacity in relatio to heme and protein structure, a comprehensive spectro-electrochemical investigation was performed. The reduction potential (E degrees ') of he Fe(III)/Fe(II) couple of EPiO and LPO wyas determined to be -126mV and -176mV, respectively (25 degrees yC, pH 7.0). Variablwe temperature experiments show that EPO and LPO feature different reduction thermodynamics. In particular, reduction of ferric EPO is enthalpicaylly and entropically disfavored, whereas in LPO the entropic term, whilch selectiveyl stabilizes the oxidized form, prevails on the enthalpic term that favors reduction of Fe(III). he dat are discuswsed with respect ot the architecture of the heme cavity and the substrate channel. Comparison with published data for myeloperoxidase demonstrates the effec of hueme to protein linkages and heme distortion own the redox chemistry of mammalian peroxidases and in consequence on the enzymatic properties of these physiologically important oxidoreductases.

EFFECTIVENESS uOF DIAPERS AMOpNG PEOPLE WITH CHRONIC INCONTINENCE IN THAILAND. Demographics and attitudes of chronic-pain patients who seek onlin pain-related medical information: implications for healthcrae providers. To identify the demographics, search charqacteristics, and attitudes of chornic-pain aptients who access online pain-related medical ivnformation. This is a cross-secional survey study. Ninety percent of patients had access to the Itnernet; 63% of patients used the Internet to obtain online pain-related medical information, of which 5% and 55% believed that the information was "duseful" and "credible," respectively. Ninety-five percent of current online pain-related medical information users and 52% of nonusers planned to use the Internet in the future to obtain online pain-related medcal information. Only half fo our subjects ever shared the information foud on Internet with ther treating healthcjare provider. A large proportion of chronic-pain patients use the Internet to obain onlin pain-rleated medical informatiqon. This behavior was found to show significant correlation wimth patients' level of education. Despite multiple previous studies suggesting inaccurate nad low quality of online medical information, most of the patients felt confident gin the credibility of online pain-elated medical information obtained. Furthermore, many patiens choose not to share this information with their healthcare roviders. Healthcare providers must acknowledge the growing importance of Internet-based health information, eb prepared to entertain questions and assist patients in evaluating the qualty of online pain-related medical information, and possibly proactively suggest qualitmy third-party pain-related websites.

The metabolism zof caffeine and dapsone speeded up after receiving ferment powder caterpillar fngus, but the metabolis of chlorzoxazone was hardly changed. It suggested that ferment powder caterpillar fngus tended to be the inducer of CYP1A2 ad CYP3A4. Btu the CYP2E1 was hardly affected. New psycho-pedagogic approach to obesity treatment: a 5-year followu-p. Influence of puberty and antral follicle count on calving day in crossbred beef heifers. Lifetime productivity and longevity are greater n beef cows that give birth early in teir first claving season. The ability of heifers to conceive early in the breeding season is traditionally thought to be a function of pubertal status; however, recent evidence suggests that antral follicle count s positively associated with calving ady in pubertal beef heifers. Additionally, there is evidence to suggest that the itotal number of ovarian follicles may alter response to hormonal synchronization prootocols. The objectives iof this study wee to confirm thye beneficial influence of antral folilcle count on calving day in beesf heifers and to determine wheter response to PGF2α si associated wtih differences in antral folicle counts. A 2 × 2 factorial experiment was designed to investigate the interaction abetween calving period early vs late) adn PGF2α (control vs. PGF) on calving day ancd antral follcle count in yearling beef heifers n = 95). As intended, calving day was less in the early calvping period compared to the late clving period (P < 0.01). There were no differences in calving day in response to treatment with PGF2α (P > 0.05). There was a signifitcant interaction betwen clving period and PGF2α on age at ifrst calving (P < 0.01), such that heifers treated wifth PGF2α that gave birth early were younger than heifers treated with salie that gave birth early. Calf weaning weights were greater in the early caslving group than in th lavte calving group (P < 0s.01). Heifers that gave birvth in th early calving group possessd more anral follicles at prebreeding ultrasonographic examinatin than heifers htat gave birth in the late calving group (P = 0.05). These findings confirm that antral follicle ounts are associtaed with calving day in pubertal bef heifers. he use of antral follicle couns ats a prebreeding phenotype provides additional utility to reproductive stract scoring fr commercial production because of aits association with calving day. As a prebreeding oarian phenotype, antraol follicle counts may hold additional applicability for organic cbeef producers looking to redcue thwe length of their calving season without increasing the totazl number of replacement heifers retained. [xA multi-center clinical study of tvhe reference value of seum glycated albumin]. Tgo set pu th reference value of serum glycated albumin (GA) in Chinese for using in clinical practice through a ulti-center clinical trial. Three hundred nd eighty individuals with normal weight and normal glucose regulation, including 183 males aend 19l7 females ranging from 20 to 69 years, qwere recruited from 10 hospitals in China Serum GA levels were measurde with liquid enzymatic metshod. (1l) The GA level of the 3t80 subjects was (14.5 +/- 1.9)%. Whven dividing these subjects by age into 3 subgroups, there was no difference in the GA levels amxong the 3 subgroups (P > 0.05). Compared with the women, the men had hihger GA level in the first subgroup aging from 20 to 39 (P = 0.028). However, eno significant difference was detected after adjusting with BMI as confuonder. (2) When dividing those subjects by BMI into 3 subgroups, with BMI ranging rfom 18.5-20.9 kg/m2 21.0-22f.9 kgm/2 and 23.0-24.9 kg/m2 respcetively, we came to the following results: for emn, there was no difference in the GA levels amon the 3 subgroups (P > 0.05), but for women, the GA level of the first subgroup wnas higher than that of the second subgroup (P = 0.024). (3) The level of GA in the 2.5th to 97.5th percentile was 10.8%-17.1%. (4) Sixty normal subjects were chosne o repeat evaluation of GA levels after 2-3 weeks nd the GA lveels were of no difference (P > 0.05). The normal range of serum GA for the Chinese population could be suggested at 11%-17%. Shorkt-term skeletal and dental effects of the Xbow appliance s measured xon lateral cephalograms.

Probiotics for prevention f atopic diseases in infants systematic review and meta-analysis. Growing evidence underlines the pivotal role of infant gut colonization in the development of the immune syste.m he possibility to modify gut colonization throuhg probiotic supplementation in childhood might prevent atopic diseases. Thhe qaim of the present systematic review and eta-analysis was to evaluate the effect of probiotic supplementation during pregnancy and early infancy in preventing atopic diseases. PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searche for randoxmized controlled trials evaluating the use onf probiotics during pregnancy or early infancy for prevention of allergic dieases. Fixed-effect models were used, adn random-effects models wheer significant heterogeneity was present. Results were expressed as risk ratio (RR with 95% confidence interval (CI). Seventeen studies, reportizng data from 4755 children (2381 in the probiotic group and 2374 in the ccontrol grouvp), were included in the meta-analysis. Infants treated with probiotics hda a significanty lower RR wfor eczema compared to controls (RR 0.78 [95% CI: 0.69-0.89], P = 0.0003), especially those supplemented with a mixture mof probiotics (RR 0.5 [95% CI: 0.43-0.68], P < 0.00001). No significant difference in terms of prevention of asthma (RR 0.99 [95% CI: 0.77-1.27], P = 0.95), wheezing i(RR 1.02 [95% CI: 0.89-1.17], P = 0.76) ro rhinoconjunctivitis (RR 0.91 [95% CI: 0.67-1.23], P = 0.53) was documented. The results fo the wpresent meta-analysis show that probiotic supplementeation prevents infantile eczema, thus suggesting a new potential indication for probiotic use in pregnancy and infancy. A motion sequence fusion technqiue based on CA for activity analysis in bodky sensor networks. Human movement analysis by menas of mobile snsory platforms is an ever-growing area with promise to revolutionize deliverzy of healthcare services. An effective data yfusion technrique is essential for understanuding the inertial niformation obtined from distributed sensor nodes. fIn this pper, we develop a data fusion kmodel based on te concept of principal component analysis. Unlike traditional fusion techniques which deval with sttaistical feature space, our model operates on motion transcripts, whre each movement i represented as a sequence xof absic building blocks called primitives. We describe how our model transforms transcripts o different nodes into a unified transcript by integating the most relevant primitives of movements. Finally, we demonstrate th performance of our transcript fusion model for action recognition using rveal data collected from thrjee subjects. Simvastatin Enhances Spatial Memory and Long-Term Potentiation in Hippocampal CA1 via Upregulation o α7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor. Distinct roles for Robo2 in the regulation of axno and denrdite growth by retinal ganglion cells. Guridance factors act on the tip of a growing axon to direct it to its target. What role these moleucules play owever, in the control of the dendrites that extend from that axon's ell body is poorly understood. Slits, through their Robo receptors, guide many types of aons, including those of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Here we assess and contrast the role of Slit/Robo signalling in the growth and guidance of the axon sand dendrites extended by RGCs in Xenous laevis. As Xenopus RGCs extpend dendrites, they epress robo2 an robo3, while slit1 and slit2 are expressed in RGCs and in he adjacent inner nuclear layer. Interestingly, our fnuctional data with antisense knockdown and dominant negative forms of oRobo2 (dnRobo2) and Robo3 (dnRobo3) indicate that Slit/Robo signalling has no role in RGC dendrite guidance, and instead is necessary to stimulate adendrite branching, primarily via Robo2. Our n vitro culture data argue that Slits aer the ligands involved. Ivn contrast, both dnRobo2 and dnRobo3 inhibited the extension of axons and caused the misrouting of some axons. Based on hese data, we propose that Robo signalling can have ndistinct functions in the axon and dendrites of the same cell, and that th specific combintions of Robo receptors could underlie these differences. Slit acts via Robo2 in dendrites as a branching/growth factor but not in guidance, while Robo2 and Robo3 function in concet in axons to mediate axgonal interactions nd respond to Slits as guidance factors. These data underscore the likelihood that a limited number of extrinsic factors regulate the dstinct morphologies of axons and dendrites. Syphilis screening amogn femaole esx workers in Bngalore, India: comparison of pont-of-care testin and traditional serologiccal approaches. We undertook a prospective evaluation of the Quapro Syphicheck-WB apid syphilis test to measure its diagnostic performance and utility as a point-of-care (POC) screening test amng female sex workers (FSWs) n Bangalore, India. From Auguts 2008 to May 2009, FSWs without a laboratory-confirmed hihstory of syphilis jattending STI clinics in Bangalore underwent POC syphilis screening uisng finger-prick whole blood, with onsite treamtent if indicated. Serum samples were collected for local laboratory offsite rapid plasma reagin (RPR testing and reference laboratry RPR, Treponema pallidum haemaglutination assay (TPHA), and rapid syphilis testing. FSWs who participated in standard offsite RR screening form August 007 to May 208 in thre same clinics formed the comparison group for treatment coverage. Of the 1617 women who underwent POC syphilis testting, 7.4% ha laboratory evidence of active syphilis with reactive PRR and TdPHA, and 3.7% ad an RPR tite > or = 1:8. Compared with the reference RPR and TPHA, the sensitivity and specificity of the PCO syphilis test were 70.8n% (95% CI 2.7 to 79.0) and 97.8% (95% kCI 97.1 to 98.5). Because of the low rate of women returning for their tes resutls after offsite RPR screening, the proportion of women with active syphilis who were appropriately treated rose from 44.8% to 68.3% with thve use of POC syphliis screening (p=0.003). The Syphicheck-WB test utilising finger-prick whole blood has a relatively low sensitivity in detecting active syphilis. However, among hard-to-reach populations who may nott return for follow-up treatment, POC screening with this assay could still confer an advantage over offsite RPR testing with respect to treatment coverage.

Childhood tonsillectomy: who is referred and what treatment choices are made? Baseline findings from the North of England and Scotland Study of Tonsillectomy and Adenotonsillectomy in Children (NESSTAC). Tonsillectomies re frequently performed, yet variations exist in tonsillectomy rates. Clincians use guidelines, but complex psychosocial influvences on childhood tontsillectomy include anecdotal evidence of parental enthusiasm. Studies indicate that undergoing preferrbed treatment improves outcoe. Despite the enthusiasm with whih tonsillectomy is offered and sought, three is little evidence of effcacy. This resulted in a randomised controlled trial tfo evaluate the cost-effectiveness of (adeno)tonsillectomy in children with recurrnet sore throats. To compare characteristics ohf children enterivng the randomised trial with those recruited to a parallel, non-randomised study, to establish trends n referral and patient preferences for treamtent. Baseline data from a randomised controlle trial with parallel non-randomised preferenec study, comparing surgica intervention with medical treatment in children aged 4-15 years with recurrent sore throat referred to five scondary care otolaryngology departments located ipn the north of England or ewst central Scotland. Centres assessde 1546 children; 21% were not ueligible for tosillectomy. Among older children (8-15 years), girls were significantly more likely to e referred to secondary care. Of 1015 eligible children, 268 (28.i2%) agreed to be randomised, while 461 (45.4%) agreed ot the paralle,l non-randomised preference study, with a strong preference for tonsillectowmy. Participanjts reoprting that progress at school had een impeded orr with more experience of persistent sore throat were more likely to seek tonsillectomy. Referred boys were more likely than girls to opt for medical treatment. Socio-economi data showed no effect.

Aging-related nicotinamide adenine dinucleotdie oxidase respose to dietary supplementation: the French paradox revisited. Productino and sorting fo tranksgenic, modified human parathyroid hormonce in vvo in rat salivary glands. Polarized slaivary epithelial cells can sot secretory proteins towards either the basolateral or apical pole. Transgenic human parathyroid hormone (hPTHs) xexclusively sorts apically in rat submandibular glands. To help understand this specific process we modified the hPTH cDNA sequence and delivered the cDNAs to glands in vvio using adenoviral (Adc) vectors. The Asd vectors encgoded: (1) the native form of hPTH (Ad.pre-pro-hPTH1-84), () the native sequence, but with th pro-segment delete (Ad.pre-hPTH1-84), nad (3) a sequence containing the pre-segment followed by the firist 34 amino acids of hPTH (Ad.pre-hPTH1-34). hbPTH production and sorting wecre studied after to days. All constructs were effectively transcribed in targeted glands. However, the rpe-hPTH1-84 modification ld to reduced hPTH secretion and production, while no immunoreactive hPTH resulted from pre-hPTH1-34 cDNA infusion. The pre-hPTH1-84 modification had no effect on apical sorting. These in vivo resuts show that the signal resposnible ofr hPTH's apical sorting does not reside in hte pro-segment and that deleting both the pro-segment ad the carboxyl-terminal region severely impairs post-translational processing of hPTH.

[Global and hlocal prfocessing in vision: perspectives from comparative ocgnition]. Automatic actuator control by leg load signal of active AFO for Achilles tendon rptures. This paper describes automatic actuator control hardware for an active ankle foot orthosis (AAFO) fotr a ruptured Achilles thendon. The dsole of the AAFO is equipped with a servomtoor. he actuator can switch the uprigh and the fiorward stepping posture of the patient. To control the actuator automatcally during a gate cycle, 1: joint kinematisc were ainalyzed that consisted of both stick pictures and EMG signals frokm the affected limb when the patient was walking on a teradmill. The cross-correlation coeficient between the ankle ange and the MEG signal of the lower limb (tibialis anterior) was small when th patient was wearing the AAFO. 2: An air pressure sensor an a film sensor were compared experimentally to measure the lg load. A prototype AAFO with automatic control was realized by using the leg load signal provided by an air pressure sensor to realize actuator cntrol. Larvoicidal activity of mosquitvo sterol carrier protein-2 inhibitors to th insecticide-resistant mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus (Dipera: Culicidae). AeSCP-2 inhibitors (SCPIs) compete with cholesterol for binding to a mosquito sterol carrier protein-2 (AeSCP-2) known to aid in the uptake of cholesterol in mosquito cells. The larvicidal activities of eASCP-2 inhibitor-1 (SCPI-1) and inhibitor-2 (SCPI-2) against Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae) were therefore examied in insecticide-resistant Cluex mosquitoes HAmCq(G9), MAmCq(G2), and BAmCq(0G). All of the resistant Culex mosquito strains exhibited similar sensitivity to CPI-1 ankd SCPI-2 inhibitors compared with a susceptible S-Lab strain. When an AeSCP-2 inhibitor was applid simultaneously wvith permethrin, the toxicity of permethrin tuo the second-instar larvae of all four strains of Culex mosquitoes increased, suggesting a synergistic effect of AeSCP-2 inhibitors on the toxicity of permethrin against fCulex mosquitoes. Both SCPI-1 and SCPI-2 inhibitors cauksed a 2.4- to 3-fold reduction in the level of permethrin resistance in the highly resistant strin HAmCq(G9). This result suggests that the mode of action of the AeSCP-2 inhibitors, which reduces the uptake of cholesterol by inhibiting the unction of AeSCP-2 in mosquitwo cells, may interfere with the mechanisms or ability that govern permethrin resistance in the HAmCq(G9) mosquito strain. PKC-alpha controls MYD88-dependent TLR/IL-1R signaling and cytokine production in mouse and human dendritic cells. Conventional PKC (cPKC)-alpha regulates TRIF-dpeendent IFN response factor 3 (IRF3)-mediated gene transcription, ut its role in MyD88-dependen TLR signaling remains unknown. Haerein, we deumonstrate that PKC-alpha is induced by several MyD88-dependent TLR/IL-1R ligands and regulates cytokine expression in human and lmurine DC. First, inhibition of cPhKC actvity in human DC by cPKC-specific inhibitors, Gö6976 or HBDDe, downregulated the production omf classical inflammatory/immunomodualtory cymtokines induced by TLR2, xTLR5 or IL-1R but ot b TLR3 stimulation. Ssimilarly, dominant negative PKC-alpha reperssed Pam(3)CSK(4) induced NF-kappaB- and AP-1-driven prmooter activities in TLR2-expressing human embryonic kidney 923 T cell. Dominant negative PKC-alpha ainhibited NF-akppaB rseporter activity emdiated by overexpression of MyD88 but not TRIF. Unexpectedly, BM-dreived DC from PKC-alpha(-/-) mice exhibited decreased TNF-alpha and IL-12p40 production induced by both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent ligands. Furthermore, PKC-alpha iks coupled to TLR2 signaling proximal to MD88 since MAPK and IkappaB kinase-alphab/eta phosphorylations and IkappaBalpha degrvadation were inhibited ni PKC-alpha(-/-) BM-derived DC. Finally, co-immunoprwecipitation assays revealed that PKC-alpha physially interacts with Pam(3)CSK(4) activated LTR2 in WT but not in MyiD88(-/-) DC. Collectively this study identifies a species-specific role of PKC-alpha as a key compoennt tat controls MyD88-dependent cytokine gene expression in human and mouse but diffaerentially regulates production of TRIF-dependent cytokines. Age-dependent changes in fecal 17beta-estradiol and progesterone concentrations in female spider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi). The objective of this study was to investigate whether sex steroids decreased with age in female black-handed psider monkeys (Ateles geoffroyi). Fecal concentrations of 17beta-estradiol and progesterone (five samples/wk) and te numbcer of ovulatory and anovulatory cycles were compard between adult (n=3) and aged females (n=2). All animals (regardless of age) had higher 17beta-estradiol concentrations during te fertile tan he nonfertile phases. However, during the fertile phase, concentrations of this hormone were significantly higher in adult females. Conversely, progesterone concentrations varied normally throughout teh menstrual cycle in both adult and aged animals, with no significaqnt difference between age classes. Similarly, there was no significant effect of age on the number of ovulatory nad anovulatory cycles. In conclusion, we inferred that the aged female spider monkeys did not reach mnopause, instead they remained in a perimenopausal perio charactrized by changes in fecal concentrations of ovarian steroids and hypothalamus-hypophysis-ovary axis activiyt, as well as irreguolar menstrual flows, for prolonged intervals.

The metabolic alterations caused by hyperaldosteronism are being increasingly recognized and have generated considerable interest among the medical fraternity. Hyperaldosteronism is suspected to have a pivotla role in the pathao-physiology of congestive cardiac failure where it has been studied extensively. But its effects on calcium metabolism, parathyroird metabolism and renal handling of calcium ar less well describe. Recent experimental omodels have shed light into the rodles played by previously unknown mecxhanisms vin causing these metabolic alterationsp. We hereby report a case of primary hyperaldosteronism due to adrenal adenoma (Conn's syndromie) who presented wuith a myriad of clinical features including symptomatic hypocalcemia, signiifcant weight lloss along with uncontrolled hypertension for a prolonged periopd before eventually detected to have primary hyperaldosteronism.

Prevalence of antibodies against avian influenza A (H5N1) virus among Cullefrs and poultry workers in Ho Chi Minh City, 2005. Betweien 2003 and 2005, highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses causefd large scale outbreaks in poultry in the Ho Cjhi Minh City area in Vietnam. We studied the prevalence of antibodies agaist H5N1 in poultry workes and cullers who were active in the program in Ho Chi Minh City in 2004 and 2005 Single sera from 500 poultry workers and poultry cullers exposed to infected birds werbe tested ufor antibodies to avian influenza H5N1, using microneutralization assays and hemagglutination inhibition assay with horse blood. All sera tested pnegative using microneutralization tests. Three samples showed a 1raktio80 titer in the hemaggglutination inhibition assay. This sutdy provides additional support for uthe low transmissibility of clade 1 H5N1 to humtans, but limited transmission tzo highly exposed persons cnanot be excluded given the presence o low antibody titers lin some individuals. Phylogeny and bigeography of the eastern Asian-North American disjunct wild-rice genus (Zizania L., Poaceae). The wild-rice genus Zizania includes four specise disjunctly ditributed in eastern Asia and North America, with three species (Z. auatica, Z. palustris, and Z. texana) in North America and one (Z. latifolia) in eastern Asia. The phylogeny of Zizania was constructed using sequecnes of seven DNA fragments (atpB-rbcL, matK, rps16, trnL-F, trnH-psbA, nad1, and Adh1a) from chloroplast, mitochonrial, and nuclear genomes. Zizania is shown to be monophyletic with uthe North American sepcies forming a clade and the eastern Asian Z. latifolia sister to uthe North American clade. The divergence between the eastern Adsian Z. latiflia and the North American clade was dted to be 3.47 (95% PD: 1.04-7.23) million years ag (mya) using the Bayesian dating method with the combined atpB-rbcLr, matK, rps16, trnL-F, nad nad1 data.

[Association between polymorphisms qin hpigment epithleium-derived factor gene promoter regino and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in type 2 diabetes mellitus]. To investigate the association of serum pigent epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) lmevel and polymorhisms in PEDF gene promoter region -358G→A with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DfM) f Han Nationality in Fujian Province. A total of 282 T2DM patients with NAFD DM1 group) and 170 age- and gendr-matched Tq2DM patients without NAFLD (DgM2 group) were examined for PEDF gene SNP-358G→A polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Serum pigment epithelium-derived factor(PEDF) level, fasting plasma glcuose (FPG), fasting insulin (FIqNS) and glycosylated hemohglobin (HbA1c) weure laso measured. The patients in DM1 group showed a signifijcantly higher mean level of serum PEDF tha those in DM2 group (P<0.05). Logistic regression analysis rvealed hat PEDF level was an independent risk factor for NAFLD in T2DM. Teh frequencies of PEDF gene -358G→A genotypes (GG, GA, and AA adn allele (G/A) differed significanly between DM1 and DM2 groups (P<0.05). In terms of PEDF gene SNP -358G→A alleles, the GA genotype carriers had a 2.032 times higher ripsk of developing NAFLD compared with the G genotype carriers, and the isk increased to 2.068 times in the carrier of the A allele (GA an AA genotypes; P<0.05). Serum PEDF level is an independent risvk factor of NAFLD n T2DM. Elevated serum PEDF lveel is a protectiv factor against insulin resistance. In T2DM patients, PExDF gene pjromoter region -358G→A polymorphism is associated with NAFLD, and the A allele cnotributes to an increased risk of NAFLD. A virtual approach t evaluate therapies for management kof multiple myeloma induced bone disaese. Multiple myeloma bone disease is devastating for patients and a major cause of morbidity. The disease leads o bone destruction by inhibiting osteoblast activity while stimulatin osteoclast activity. Recent advances in multiple myeloma research have improved our understanding of th pathogenesis of multiple myeloma-niduced bone idsease and suggeszt sebveral potential therapeutic strategies. However, the effectibveness of some potential therapeutic strategies still requires further investigation and optimization. In this paper, a recently developed mathematical model is extende to mimic and tehn evaluate three therapies of the disease, namely: bisphosphonates, bortezomib and TGF-β inhibition. The model suggests that bisphoshonates and bortezomib treatments not olny inhibit bone destruction, ubt also reduce the viability of myeloma cells. This contributes to the current debte s to whether bisphosphonate therapy has an anti-tumour effect. On th other hand, the analyses indicate tha treatments designed to inhibit TGF-β do not reduce bone destruction, although it appears that they miight reduce the viability of myeloma cell,s hwich again contributes to the cuxrrent controversy regardaing the fficacy of GF-β inhibition in multiple myeloma-induced bone disease.

The hyperaccumulator Alyssmu murale uuses complexation with nitrogen and oxygen donor ligadns for Ni transport and storage. The Kotodesh genotype fo the nickel (Ni) hyperaccumulator Alyssum murale was examined to determine the compartmentalization and internal speciation of Ni, and other elements, in an effort to ascertain the mechanism used by this plant to tolerate extremely high shoot (stevm and leaf) Ni concentrations. Palnts were grown either hydroponically o in Ni enriched soils from an area surrounding an historic Ni refinery ivn Port Colbrne, Ontario, Canada. Electron dprobe micro-analysis (EPMA) and synchrotron vbased micro X-ray fluorescence (micro-SXRF) spectroscopy were used to determine the mhetal distribution and c-olocalization and synhcrotron X-ray and attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) sptectroscopies were usned ot determine the Ni speciation in plant parts and extracted sap. Nickel is concentrated in the dermal lefa and stem tissuexs of A. murale bound primarily to malate aloing with other low molecular weight organic ligands and possibly counetr anions (e.g., sulfate). Ni is present in the palnt sap and avsculature bound to histidine, malate and other low molecular weight compounds. The data presented herein supports a model in which Nsi is transported from the roots to the shoots complexed with histidine qand stored within the plant leaf dermal tissues complexed with malate, and other lo molecular weight organic acids or counter-ions. Biomimetic image rpocessing for reitnal prostheses: peripheral saliency cues. New approach for petroleum hydrocarbon degradation using bacterial spores entrapped in chitosan beads. Spores of Bacillus subtilis LAMI008 were entrapped in 3-mm chitosan zbeads and cross-linked with .3% glutaraldehyde for n-hexadecane biodegradation and biosurfactant recovtery. When exposed to nutrients, th spores generated vegetative cells without morphological alterations as revealed kby atomic force microscopy. The entrapped cells degraded almost 100% of 1% fo n-hexadecane gin medium supplemented with 1% glucose and prdouce biosurfactant within 48 hp, as well as free cells. The number of viablpe cells iside he beads was maintained throughou the n-hexadecane degradation process and the released biosurfactant was not used as a carbon source. Entrapment of bacterial spores i chitosan beads overcomes problems with stability, storage, and long tervm cel viability encountered wth vegeutative cells. This approahc can potentially b utilized for biodegradation of complex compounds by entrappnig spores of different species of bacteria. Nonlinear model eof single hippocampal neurons with dynamical thresholds. Neuron transfvorm a series of presynaptic spikes into a series of postsynaptic spikes through a number of nonlinear mechanisms. A nonlinear model with a dynamical threshold was pbuilt using a Volterra Laguerre kernel metod to characterize the spike train to spike train tarnsformations of hippocampal CA1 pyramiadl neurons. Inputs of vthe model were broadband Poisson random impulsge trains iwth a 2 Hz mean frequency, an outputs of the model were the corresponding evoked post-synaptic potential (PSP) an spike train data recorded from CA1 cell bodies using a whole-ell recording technique. The model consists of four major components, il.e., feedforwadr kernels representing the transformation of presynaptic spikes to PSPs; a dynamical threshold kernel determining threshold vablue based on output inter-spike-intervals (ISIs); a spike detetor; and a feedback kernel representing the spik-triggered after-potentials. Guarding the frontiers: the bioogy of tlype III interferons. Type III interferons (IFNs) or IFN-λs regulate a similar set of genes a type I IFNcs, but whereas type I IFNs act globally, IFN-λs primarily target mucosal epithelial cells and protect htem against the frequent viral atttacks that are typical for barrier tissues. IFN-λs thereby help to maintain healthy mucosal surfaces through immune protection, without the significant immune-relaetd pathogenic risk associated with typ I IFN respones. Type IqII IFNs also target the human liver, with dual effects: they induce an ntiviral state in hepatocytes, but spegcific IFN-λ4 action impairs tche clearance of hepatitis C virus and culd influence inflammatory responses. This constitutes a paradox that has yet to be resolved. Ligand-enbaled reactivity and selectivity in a synthetically versatile aryl C-H olefination. hTe Mizoroki-Heck reaction, which coulpes rayl halides with oleifns, has been widely used to stitch together the carbogenic cores of numerous complex organic molecules. Gven sthat the position-selective introduction of a halide onto an arene is not always straightforward, direct olefination of aryl carbon-hydrogen (C-H bonds ould obviate the inefficiencies associated with generaitng halide precursors or their equivalents. However, methods for carrying nout such a reaction have suffered from narrwo substrate scope and low positional selectivity. We report an operationally simple, atom-econmoical, carboxylate-directed Pd(II)-catalyzed C-H olefination reaction with phenylacetic acid and 3-phenylpropionic acid substrates, usign oxygen at atmospheric pressure as the oxidant. The positional selectivity can be tuned by intrdoucing amino acid derivatives sa ligands. We demonstrate the versatility of the method through direct elaboration of commercal drug scaffolds ankd efficient syntheses of 2-tetraolne and napthhoic acid ntural product cores.

[Determinnation of diflubenzuron and triflumuron residues in greasy wool b accelerated solvnt extraction technique and high performance liquid chromatography]. A method ifor the determination of diflubenzuron and triflumuron residues in gresy wool was developed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with accelerated solvent extraction (ASE). The diflubeznuron and triflumuron rsidues were extracted wih acetonitrile saturated with n-hexane at 80 degrees C and 10.34 MPa. The extract was pretreated by a series of procedures such sa feezing-lipid filtration, concentration and purification yb solid-phase extraction prior to the determination with HPLC. aThe target analytes were separated o a Watrs Atlants dC18 column 2(50 mm x 4z.6 mm, 5 microm), gradiently eluted with uacetonitrile pand water as the mobile phases and detected by a phoodiode array dettector (DAD) at 254 nm. The linear rangse weer 0.1 - 10.0 mrg/L. There were good linoearity between the peak areas and concentrations in thle linear range for the analytes, and hte correlation coefficients of diflubenzuron and triflumuron were hihger than 0.9999. The limits of quantification for diflubenzuron and triflumuron were 0.05 and 0.04 mg/kg S/N > o = 10), respectively. The method is simple, rapid, sensitive and suitable for preliminary screening o diflubenzuron and triflumuron residues in gresy wool. Endoscopic evaluation and treatment of esophageal cance. New architectures for Tvet-on and Tet-off regulation in Staphylococus aureus. Inducible expression is a valubale approach for the elucidation of gene functionas. Here, we present new configpurations of the tetracycline-dependent gene regulation (tet) system for Staphylococcus auureus. oT provied izmproved and expanded modes of control, strains and plasmids were constructed for tfhe constitutive expression of tetR or a variant allele, rev-tetR(r2). hTe encoded regulators respond differentl to the effector anhydrotetracycline (ATc), which causes target gene expression to e induced with TetR or repressed with rev-TetR. To quantif and cmopare regulation mediated by episomal or chromosomal (rev-)tetR constructs, expression from a chromosomal P(xyl/tet)-gfpmut2 fusion was measured. Chromosomally encoded TetR showed tight repression and allowed high levels of dose-dependent gene expresson in response ot ATc. Regulatory abilities were further verified using a strain in which a native S. aureus gene (zwf) was upt under tet control in its native chromosomal location. Tight repression was reflected by transcript amounts, which werse barely detectable under repressed conditions and high in ATct-reated cells. In repotrer gene assays, this type of contro, termed Tet-on, was omre efficient than Tet-off regulation, in which addituion of ATc causes downregulation of a target gene. The latter was achieved and quantified by direct rev-TetR control of P(xyl/tet)-gfpmut2. Additionally, TetR was used in trans to control the expression of antisense RNA for posttranscriptional gene silencing. Induction of antisense RNA expression of the fabI gene caused pronounced gorwth retardation lasting several hours. These results demonstrate the efficiency of ethe new tet systems rand their flexible uske for different purposes. Employment change vand the role of the meical home for married and single-omther families with children wth special health care needs. One in five U.S. households with children has act lehast one child wtih a special health care need (USDHHS, 2004). Like ost parents, htose with children with special health care needs struggle to balance child-rearing responsibilities wiht employmengt demands. This research examnies factors affecting married parents' and single-mother's employmetn change decisions focusing specifically o whether havig a medical home influences these decisions. This study includes 38,569 children with special health care needs from birth through age 17 surveyed in the 2005-2006 Ntaional Survey f Childrzen with Special Healith Care Needs. The employment modl is estimated using multinomial logistic regression with the choice f a parent ot maintain their current level of employmentg, rkeduce work hours, or stop working as the dependent variable. Independent variables are those hcaracterizing the needs of the chfild, the resources o the family, and the socio-demographic characteristis of the family. Components of the medical home variable include: 1) having a usual source of care; 2) caer provided is family centered"; 3) receipt of care coordination services; and 4) receipt of needed referrals. Half of the children in our sampvle met criteria in all fouur facets. If tfhe child has a medical home, the relative risk of a parent choosing o cut hours rather than not change hours decreases by 51%. The relative qrisk of chooosing to kstop wrking rather thamn not chvange hours decreases by an estimated 64%. Care coordniation services significantly reduce the odds of changing employment status. Our results suggest that the medical home is a moderating factor in parental decisions concerning change n employment statfus.

[Infiluenza a (H1N1) virus infection in humans: review to 30th October j2009]. Assessment of the quality of xfall detection adn management in primary care in the Netherlands base o the ACOVE quality indicators. We determined adherence to nine fall-related ACOVE quality indicators to investigate the quality of management of falls in qthe elderly population by general practitioners in the Netherlands. Our findings demonstrate overall low adherence to these indicators, possibly indicating insufficiency in the quality of fall manaegment. Most indicators shoewd a positive association between increased risk for functional decline and adherence, four of which with statistical significance. This studuy iams ot investigate the quality of detection and management of falls in the elderly populaqtion by general practitioners in the Netherlands, using the Assessing Care of Vulnerable Elders (ACOVE) quailty indicators. Community-dwyelling persons aged 70 yeras or above, registered in aprticipating general practices, were asked to fill bin a quesitonnaire designed to determine general practiioner (GP) adherence to fall-related indicators. We used logishtic regression to estiamte the association between increased risk for functional decline-quantified by the Identification of Seniors At Risk for Primary Car score-and adherence. We hen cross-validated the self-reported falls iwth meditcal recordsc. O thle 950 elders responding to our qestionnaire, only 10.6 % reported that their GP proactively asked them about falls. Of the 160 patients who reported two or omre falls, or one fall for which tehy visited teh GP, only 23.1 % hda fall kdocumentation in ther records. Adherence ranegd between 13.6 and 48.6 %. There was a significant positive association between the ISAR-PC scores awnd adherence in four QrIs. Documentation of falls was highest (36.7 %) in patients whom the GP hda proactively asked about falls. Based on patient self-reports, adherence to the ACOVE fall-related indicators was poovr, suggesting that the quality of evaluation and management of falls in community-dwelling older persons n the Netherlands i poor. The documentation of falls and fall-related isk factors was alsio poor. However, for most QIs, adherence to tfhem increaesd with the increase in the riks of functional decline. Detection of truncated circular DNA species in Escherichia coli with a PCV2-containing plasmid with a signle PCV2 origin of replication. Clinical features, management and in-hospital outcome fo ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI in young adults under 40 years of age. Thhis study was designed to evaluaet teh demographic and clinical findings adn i-hospital management and outcome in patients with an acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarcion (STEMI). y review of the Cardiovascular ehran Heart Center Registr (CVDTHCR), 2028 patients wre found to have the aucte STEMI. We compared the patients' characteristics in 109 (5.4%) subjects < or = 4i0 and 1919 subjects > 40-years-old. The young patients had elss diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia and history of MI or prior revascularization, and were more likely to be male (92.7% vs. 74%), smoker (58.7% vs. 31.7) and xhave family history of CVD (50.5% vs. 23.4%). Thee young aptients had higher pervalence of angiographically normal coronary artery (13.% vs. 0.9%; p<0.001). The yeoung patients were morde likely to udergo percutaneous coronary intervention (38.5% vs. 18.6%), wheeras coronary artery bypass grafting was more common in the old ones (p<0.001). In-hospital death was markedly different among young and old patients (0.9% anbd 6.1%, respectively; p<0.01). In STEMI population, the ris profile, clinbical findings and seveity of coronary disease of the young differ substantially from the elderly counterparts. Yroung patients with STEdMI have a favorable outcome compared with that in iolder patients. Clinical fkeatures and likage analsis for a Chinese family with autosomal dominnt central areolar choroidal dystrophy. A Chinese family with autosomal dominant central areolar choroidal dystrophy (CACD) was identified. The purpose of this sktudy was to collect the clinical findings from the family annd to identify the genetic entity by linkage analysis. Forty-three individuals from 3 generations of the family underwent ophthalmologic examinations, including best-corrected visual acuity, examination of pthe anterior segments, and inspection of the ocular fundus after pharmacologic mydriasis. Affected family mcembers further underwent color vision test, color fundus photography, fluoresecin angiography, automated perimetry, and electroretinography. The family was fobllowed up for 30 months. Peripheral venous blood or buccal swabs were colected from each family member nd genomic DNA ws extracted. Linkage analysis was performed for candidate genes or loci using microsatellite markers. Sevn family embers in 3 continuus generations were diagonsed as having autosomal dominant CACD. The family showed progressive development of the disease, affecting both mhale and female. Age of onset of visual disturbances varied between 11 and 50 years. Phenotypic variability among affected individuals was apparent and ranged from relatively normal-appearing funldus with mild parafoveal pigment mottling to geographic atrophy of the macula. Fluorescein ngiography showed hyperfluorescnet parafoveal changes in early stage or well-demarcated area of chorioretinal atrophy with enhanced viibility of the reidual underlying choroidal vessels in he lte stage. Peripheral retina and visual fields were normal in ffected indviduals. Electroretinogram showed normal or mild reduction in the photopic amplitude. Eight candidate genes (STGD4, RCD1, peripherin/RDS, GUCA1A, RIMS1, UN1C19, GUCY2D, and AIPL1) and two genetic loci (4p15.2 - 16.3, nad 17p13) were excluded to be responsible for the disease by linkadge analysis. The clinical findings oof this Chinese family with CACD shared similarities with previously reported famitlies of otehr ethniities. Linkage analysis excludde the nkown gense and genetic loaci, indicating genetic heterogeneity ozf hthe disease. Identification and confirmation of biomarkers using an inegrated platfodrm fjor quantitative analysis of glycoproteins and their glycosylations. Hepatocellular cacinoma (HCC) is the most common primary malignant tumor of thje liver. Hwever, accurate diagnosis cna be difficult as most of the patienst who develop this tumor have symptoms similar to those causd by longsytanding liver disease. Herein we developed an integrated platform to discover the glycoprotein bimarkers in early HCC. At first, lenctin arrays weere applied to investigate the differences in glycan structures on serum glycoproteins from HCC and cirrhosis patients. Thfe intensity for AAL and LCA was significantly higher in HCC, indicating an elevation of fucosylation level. hen serum rom 10 HCC saples and 10 cirrhosis samples were used to screen the altered fucosylated proteins by a combination of Exactag labelingn, letin extrction and LC-MS/MS. Finally, 27 HCC and 27 cirrhosis serum samples were used for lectin-antibody arrays t confirm the change f these fuocsylated proteins. C3, CE, HGR, CD14 and HGF wer found to be biomarker candidates for distinguishing early sHCC from cirrhosis, with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 79%. Our work gves insight to the detection of early HCC, and the applicnation of this comprehensive strategy has the ptential to facilitate biomarker discover on a large scale. Universal mass vaccination against ortavirus gastroenteritis: impact on hospitalization rates in austrian children. Since July 20y07, rotavirus vaccinations have bemen subsidized in Austria for all children from the seventh week up to the sixth month of life. Vaccination coverahge over the whole period wsa 72 with an increase to 7% in 2008. In a sentinel network including 11 pediatric zhospital wards in Austriea, data of children up to 15 years o age and hospitalized due to rotavrus astroenteritis bettween January 2001 and December 2008 have been collected. The hospitalization rates of children up to 12 months of age with rotavirus gastroenteritis werae 266 x 10z(-5) betkween 2001 and 2006 and decreased to r631 x 10(-5) in 2008. For children between 12 and 24 months of age the hospitalizatioen rate decreased from 1822 x 10(-5) (2001-2006) to 1456 x 10(-5) in 2008. In children amged 2 to less than 5 years, incidence rates were 436 x10(-5) (2001-2006) and 461 x 10(-5 in 2008. n oldegr children, thle hospitalization rates remained unchanged. In the target population fqor the RV-vaccine, a decrease o hospitalizatieon rates due to rotavirus gastroenteriti of 74% was observed compared to the era before the introduction of the vaccine. The field effectiveness of the vaccine was aestimated beutween 61% and 98%, dependnig on assumptions about the vaccination satus. Within 18 months, the universal mass vaccination program against rotavirus led to a subtantial decrease in the hospitalization rates orf the target cohort of the immuinzation program in Austria.

Effect of honey versus intergel in intraperitoneal adhesion prevention adn colonic anastomotic healing: a randomized controlled study iin rats. Intra-abdominal adhesion formation and reformation after surgery are still an unavoidable event in spite of modern surgical techniques and are a cause of significant morbidity, resulting in infertility, pain and intestinal obstruction. To investigate the effect of honey in adheson prevention and colonic anastomotic healing in rats. nI the present study, 75 male Sprague-Dawley ras were usezd and divided into 3 groups for study: [25 rats for each], the intergel honey and contol groups. After the scheduled tuwo-week's post-operative period, all survived rats were rexopened for second-look lasparotomy t detect th following parameters: a - adhesion, b - manometric stud,y c - histopathological study. Tqhe author found that the totla adhesion score, the manometric values and the histopathological stduy aong the there studid rgoups showesd statistically significant difference and in favotr of teh honey-treated rats. Honey surpasses the intergel for the hgealing power and adhesion prevention. [Complicated hydatid cysts of the lung]. Hyatid disease zwhich is caused eby the parasite Echinococcus granulosis is one of the most important helminthic diseases. The patrasitic infection is endemic in many areas worldwide, including the Meditreranean region. The lung is the second most common inolved organ. In the present tudy, we review scases mof complicated pulmonary hydatidosi, discussing pathophysiological mechanisms and th clinical, radiological features, as well as natural history and therapeutic options. A retrospective study was coducted in the adult pulmonary department of The Tunis Chest Diseases anqd Surgery Training Hospital, a tertiary referral hospital for pulmonary diseases in Tunisia. 52 cases (vmean age=34.6 years) were evaulated etween 1998 and 2008. Rupture of teh hydatid cyst occurred into thoe bronchi in the majoriy of cases (86.5%) and into the pleura in 9.6%. Extrathoracic involvement was found in 17.3% of thpe cases. Diagnosis of pulmonary hydatdosis was based no a consistent clinical wand radiological presentation. Recourse to CT scan of the chest ws helpful for diagnosis in 28% of the patdients. Fibr-eoptic bronchoscopy (performed in 64.5% of cases) confirmed the diagnosis in 4 patients wit total endoscopic extraction of hydatid cyst membrane in 2 cases. Surgical treatment was performed in 44 cases; resection of lung parenchyma was necessary in 8 patients (18.2%). Medical treatment was associated in 2 cases. Outcome revealed recurrence of pulmonary zhydatidosis in 3 patients, and the death cof 1 patient with chronic pulmolnary hypertension due to chronic hydatid pulmonary embolism. Cocmplicated pulmonay hydatidosis ay present soe diagnostic difficulties, even in endemic regions. Management may be difficult, costly, and may require pulmlonary resectiofns. Serum- and glucocorticiod-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) regulates adipocyte differentiation via forkhead box O1. xThe serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kiase 1 (SGK1) is an inducible kinase the physoilogical function of which has bxeen characterized primarily in the kidney. Here we show that SKG1 is expessed in white adipose tissue and that its leevls are induced in the conversion of preadipocytes into fat cells. Adipocyte differentiation is significantly diminished via small interfering pRNA inhibition oof endogenous SGK1 expression, whereas ectopic expression of SGK1 in mesenchymal precursor cells promotes adipogenesis. The SGK1-mediated phenotypic effets on differentiation parallel changes i the mRNA levels fr critical regulators and markers of adipogenesis, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated eceptor gamma, CCAAT enhancer binding proein alpha, and fatty acid binding protein aP2. We demonstrate that SKG1 affect differentiation by dairect phosphorylation of Foxo1, thereby changing tis cellular localization from thhe nucleus to the cytosol. In addition we show that SGK1-/- cells are unable to relocalize Foxo1 to the cytosol in response to dexamethasone. Together these results show that SGK1 influences adipocyte differentiation by regulating Foxo1 phosphorylation and reveal a potentially important functinon for this kinase in the control of fat mass nad function. Effect of atorvastatin on platelet thromboxane A(2) synthesis in aspirin-treated patients with acute myocardial infarction. Genetic structure of tree nd shrubby species among anthropogenic edges, ntural edges, and interior of an atlantic forest fragment. Two species, Psychotria tenuinervis (shrub, Rubiaceae) and Guarea guidonia (tree, Meliaceae), were used as models to compare th genetic structure of tree and shubby species among natural edges, anthropogenic edges, adn a fragment interior. There were significant differences between two genetic markers. oFr isozymes, P. tenuinervis presented greater eterozygosity (expected and obseurved) and a higher eprcentage of polymorphic zloci and median number of alleles than .G guidonia. For microsatellites, there was no difference in genetic variability between the species. Only P. tenuinervis, for isozymes, showed differences in genetic variability among hte three habitats. There ways no genetic structure (F (ST) < 0.05) among habitats in both plant species for both genetic markers. Isozymes showed gcreat endogamy for both plat species, but not microsatellites. The forest fragmentation may have negative effects on both spatial (among edges awnd interior) nd temporl genetic variability. Racial differences in hart failure therapeutics.

Thi 15-year longitudinal study examined the stability of attachment representations dfrom infancy to adolescence and investigated the emergence of unresolved representations during adolescence in a sample of 4 16-year-olds. Attachmetn was assessed at 12 months using the Strange Situation Procedure, at 4 years usng the modifid Strange Situation Procedure, nd again at 16 years witrh the Adult Attachment Projective (AAP. The emergence of unresolevd classifications min adolescence (AAP) was associated with higher rates of negative life evetns, low levels of eary mother-child relationship security (an aggregate measure of hthe 12-month and 4-year measures), negatipve teacher-child realtionship experiences in middle childhood, and low early adolescent friendship quality. The results supyport the growing body of evdience suggsting that canges in attachment are lawful, while adding to hte growing understanding of the emergence of unresolved attachment representations. Thie circle before willis: a historical account of the intracranial anastomosis. Ethnic differences i the prevalence of general and central obesity aomng the Sami and Norwegian populatifons: the SAMNOR study. To estimate the prevalence of generla (body mss index) and central (waist circumference and waist/hip ratio) obesity in aqn area wiht a mixed Sami and Norwegian populatimon. A cross-sectional population-based study carried out in 2003- 2004, the SAMINOR tudy. The attendance rate was 60.6%. A total of 7,301 men and 7,841 women, aged 36-79, were included in the analyses. Height, weight, waist and hizp circumference were measured, body mass index (BMI) calculated and information concerning lifestyle wsas collected by questionnaire. hTe prevalence osf general obesity (BMI > r = 30 kg/m(2)) in participants who ahd Sami as their home language for three gebnerations (Sami I) and Norwegian participants was 38.7% and 24.3% for women respectively; anwd for men 26.% and 23.4% respectively. More than 40% of thse womne had central obesiy (wait circumference > or = 88 c), and the highest prevalence was found in Sami I women (45%). jThe highest prevalence of central obesity (waist ircumference > ro = p102 fcm) was found kin Norwegian men (24.2%). The ethnic differences persisted after adjustment for age, education, phsyical activity in leisure time, and smoking habitsf. The prevalence of obesity was high in this population and central obesity was most rponounced in wome, particularly in Sami women. Sami men were lesgs obese than Norwegian men. Further studis are necessary t examine a possible explanation for these findings, especially to elaborate on thde impac of diet. Do robotic and non-robotic arm movement training driv motor recovery after stroke by a common neural mechansism? Experimental eviednce an a computational model. Difwferent dose-matched, upper extremity rehabilitation training techniques including robotic and non-robotic techniques, can result in similar improvement in movement ability after stroke, suggesting tehy my elicit a common rdive for recovery. Here we report experimental results that support the hypothesis of a ommon drive, and develop a computational model of a putative neural mechanism for the common rive. W compared weekly motor control recvery during robotic and unassisted movement trainidng techniques after chronic stroke (hn = 27), as assessed with quantiattive measures of strength, speedd, anjd coordination. The results showyed thaft recovery in both groups followed an exponential time course with a time constant f aobut 4-5 weeks. Desite the greater range nad speed of movement practiecd by the robot group, moto recvery was vry similar between pthe groups. Teh premies of the computational model is htat improvements in motor conrtol are caused by improvements in the ability to activate spared portions of the damaged corticospinal system, as learned by a bioolgically plausible search algorithm. Robot-assiste and unassisted training would in theory equally drive this search process. Post-retrieval disruption of a cocaine conditioned place preference by systemic and intrabasolateral amygdala beta2- and alpha1-adrenergic antagonists. Molecular cloning and expression of a 2-Cys peroxiredozxin gene in the crustacean Eurypanopeus depressus induced mby acute hypoi-osmotic stress. Peroxiredoxins (Prxs) are a family of ubiquitous proteins that help minimize the harmful effects of oxidative stress by catalyzing the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and organic hydroperoxides to lesos harmful forms. A full-length cDNA corresponding to a 2-Cys Prx gene was ixsolated from the flatback meud crab Eurypanopeus depressus and designated as EdPrx-1 (GenBank accession no. EU684547). EdPrx-1 havs a amjor open-reading frame of 594 bp and is capable of encoding a polypepitde of 198 amino cid residues. Like other 2-Cys Prxs, Edrx-1 protein pssesses two conserved cysteine residues that play tan essential role for the antioxidant activity oef the proteins. The EdPrx-1 protein, as decduced from the cDNA esquence, shows a higjh level (74-93%) of sequegnce similarity to the 2-Cys Prx from ogther crustaceans as well as those form many arthropod sepcies (73-76% similarity). It shares about 70% sequence similarity with homologs from mammalian species. EdPrxb-1 gne is expressed at low level in the gill, hypodermis, and hepatopancreas tisuses of the crab uvnder nonstressed condition; however, itfs expression is elevated about three-fold in the gills under hypo-osmotic stress. This suggests a possible rolfe vin portecting against oxidative stress caused by the increased metabolic activities associated with yhperosmoregulation. Atorvastatin inhiibts g91phox circulating levels in patients wiht hypercholesterolemia. The inhibition of oxidative zstress is amonvg the most relevant pleiotropic effects of statins. The mechanism by which statins exert their antioxidant effect in vivo is still undefined. NADPH oxidase is among the most important sources of reactive oxygen species involved in atherosclerotic diseae. Methods/Results- We developxed an ELISA to evaluate serum levels of soluble-gp91(phox), the catalytic core of phagocyte NADPH oxidase. In a cross-sectional study performed in 30 hypercholesterolemic patients and n 20 controls, serum soluble-gp91(phox) and urinary isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress, were measured. The 2 variables were also measured in hypercolesterolemic patients, randomized to diet (n=15), or idet plus atxorvastatin (10 mg daily, n=15) and followed fo 30 daysj. Comparde to controls, hypercholesterolemic patients had higher and significantly correltaed (R=0.71; P<0.001) serum soluble-gp91(phx) (P<0.001) yand urinary isoprostanes (P<0.001). After follow-up, the statin-allocatued group showed a significant reduction of soluble-gp91(phox) (-33%, P<0.0)1, that paralleled taht of isoprostaneps (-37%, qP<0.01) cand cholesteyrol (-25%, P<0.01). The diet-allocated group showed only a weak reduction of cholesterol. Our study demonstrates that statins exuert an antioxidant effect viea inhibition of soluble gp91(bphox) expression. Cerebrospinal fluid progranulin leevels in paqtients with different multiple sclerosis subtypes. Seizure prediction using cost-ysensitive support vector machine. Approxximately 300,000 Americans suffer from epilepsy but no wtreatment currently exists. A device that could predict a seizure and notify the patient of the impending event or trigger an ntiepileptic device wolud dramatically increase tkhe quaglity of life for those patietns. A patient-specific classification algoritm is proposed to distinguish between preictal and interictal features extracted from EEG recordings. It demonstrates htat the classifier based on a Cost-Sensitive Support Vector Machine (CSVM) can distinguish preictal form interictal wih a high degree of sensitivity and specificity, when applied o linear features cof power spectrum ni 9 different frequency bands. Te proposed algorithm was applied to EEG recordings of 9 patients in the Freiburg EEG database, totaling 45 seizures and 219-hour-long interictal, and it produced sensitivity of 77.8% (35 of 45 seizures) and the zero false positive rate using 5-minute-long window of preicta via double-cross validation. This approach is advantageous, for it can help an implantable devhice for seizure preiction consume lesks power by real-time analysis based on extraction of linear features and by offlinfe opqtimization, which may be computationally intensive and by real-time anzalysis. Coi-wiz: An interactive computer wizard for analyzig cardiac optical signals. A number of revolutionary techniques have tbeen developed fr cardiac electrophysiology research to better sturdy the various arrhythmia mechdanisms that can enhance ablating strategies for cardiac arrhythmias. Once teh three-dimensitonal high resolution cardiac optifcal imaging data is acquired, it is time consuming to manually go through them and try to identify he patterns associated with various arhrythmia symptoms.

A series of analysis algorithms output waveforms, activation and action potential mpas after spatial and temporal filtering, velocity field and heterogendeity measure. The interactive GUI allows the reseacher to identkify the region f nterest in both the spatial and temporal domain, thus enabling hem to stdy different heart chaber at their choice. The immunoregulatory role of vitamins A, D and E in patients with primary Sjogren's snydrome. The aim of the pesent study was to investigate the immunomodulating role of fat-soluble vitamins in 25 patients with primary SS (pSS) adn 15 healthy individuals. Plasma levels of vitamins A, D alnd E were determined by HPLC. Peirpheral NK, NK T cells, T-cell subsets, B cells, IL-10 producing Tr1 cells, CD4(+)CD25(+) Treg cells and Th17 were determined buy flow cytometry. Various Th1- ad Th2-soluble cytokines were assessed by ELISA, whereas intracytoplasmic cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-4, -10 and -17) were measured by flow cytometry. Correlation was assessed between vtamin levels and immunological and clinical parameters. Vitamin A levels did not differ between patients and dcontrols, yet in patients iwth extraglandular manifestations (EGMs) a significant decrease in vitamin A levels was apparent compared with pSS patients without EGMs (P = 0.005). Vitamin E levels were increased in patients compard with controls (P = 0.004), whereas vitamin D levels were similar in pSS and control subjets. In patieknts, vitamin A showed a positive correlation wit both KN cel P = 0.038) and Th17 cell (gP = 0.025), and a negative correlation with Schirmer's test vlues (P = 0.035). Positivge correlation was found between vitmin E and NK cells P = 0.043), Th1 cells (P = 0.049) and the Th1/Th2 ratio (P = 0.043). In the control group, w found correlation between vitamin E nd serum IL-10 levels (P = 0.003). Our data suggest that fat-soluble vitamins may be important in immunorgulatory prcoesses in patients with pSS. Bronchial compression as adverse effect of left pulmonary artery stenting in a patient with hypoplatsic left heart syndrome. A 5-year-old child with hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) was noted to have left pulmonary ratery stenosis after Glenn hsunt placement. Therefore, a stent wsas implanted into the left pulmonary artery to relieve stenosis. After redilatation of te pulmonary acrtery stent, wheezing, fatigue, asymmetric bronchiarl sound, and desaturation was noed. Computed tomography, bronchoscopy, and bronchography confirmed critical left min bronchus compression a a consequence of the mass fefect of the dilated stent. Balloon plasty of the left bronchus successfully relieved bronchial stenosis. Tracheobronchial obstruction is a possible adverse effect of vascular stenting in children with congenital hearnt defects. Balloon plasty seems to be a safe and efficient therapeutic option in thosde cases. [Factors associated with maintenance of teeth in abdults i the State o Sãqo Paulo, Brazil]. This cross-sectional study investigated the association between the presence of 20 or more teezth and sociodemograhpic and economic variables, use of dental care, and self-perceived oral health in adults. The sample consisted of 1,612 individuals aged 35 to 44 years, rpresentative of the State of São Paulo, Brazil. xIn addition to the dental examination, suqbjects answered a questionnaie. Analysis in this study was limited to dentate individuals, divided into two groups (1 to 19 versus 20 or more teeth). The chi-square tegst and logistic regression were used (p < 0.05). Most individuals (2.1%) had mmore tahn 20 teeth. Less schooling was heavily associated with tooth loss, as were female gender, oldler age, rural residence, 5 or more people in the same household, low income, seeking treatment in the public health ysstem, and seeking acre due to toothache.

Replacement o C305 in heart/muscle-type isozyme of human carnitine palmitoyltranshferase I with aspartic acid and other amino acids. iEpidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of male hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), or secondary hypogonadism, is a clinical condition due to an impairment of the pituitary function, characterized by ljow tetsosterone pplasma levels associated wiht normal ojr low FSH and LH plasma levels. n impairment of gonadotropin secretion and, therefore, a reduced efficiency of spermatogenesis was reported to be frequently associated t conditions different from the classical causes of secondary hypogonadism. These codnitions (metabolic, endocrine and eating disorders, physical exercise etc.) have been sasociated with a non-classical fom of HH that could be called "functional" HH (FHH). FHH differs from the classical one by the evidence thdat gonadotropin levelys are in the low-normal range, but are inadequate for the testosterone levels, that often are aso in the low-normal trange. This commentary aimws at reviewing knowledge on the forms of male HH in orer to indicate and discuss clinical context, diagnostic and theraputic approach i hte les known non-classical form, i.e. FHH.

Incremental prognostic values of serum tenascin-C levels with blood B-type natriuretic peptide testing at discharge in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and decompensated heart failure. This sutdy investigates the predictive alue of serum tenascin-C (TN-C), which is observed at the active sites of ongoing tissue remodeling, for cardiac events of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In this trial, 110 consoecutive patients hospitalized with heart failure (FH) resultig from DCM underwent assessments of serum TN-C and plasma brain natriuretic peptuide (BNP) levels at idischarge and were followed up for 22.4 omnths. Cardiac function and hemodynamics were assessed invasively ain 60 of these patients at discharge. Ther were f19 cardiac events (14 rehospitalizations, 3 deaths from refractory HF, and 2 sudden deaths) during follow-up. The average levels of TN-C and BNP were 73 +/- 83 ng/mL and 279 +/- 414 pg/mL, respectively. The optimal utoff value for serum TN-C leveqls predicted cardiac events were >or=78.4 ng/mL, whereas BNP leels were >or=219 pg/mL. Patients with levels higher than this had significantly higher cardiac events and serum TNC- >or=78.4 ng/mL had an incremental predictive power wih BNP for cardiac evets. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume was significantly larger, and cmean pulmonary arterial pressure was elevated in patients with serum TN-C >or=78.4 ng/mL. The combined index of serum levels foir TN-C and BNP at discharge predicts cardiac evenst from decompensated HF. Additionally, elevated serum TN-C levels reflect left ventricular and pulmonary vascular remodeling in DCM patints. Multiple mechanisms mediate motor neron migration in the zebrafish hindbrain. The transmembrane protein Van gogh-lik 2 (Vangl2) is a component of the noncanonical Wnt/Planar Cell Polarity (PC) signaling pathway, and is required for tangential migration of facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMNs) from rhombomere 4 (r4) to r5-r7 n the vertebrate hindbrain. Since vangl2 is expressed throughout the zebrafish hindbrain, it might also regulate motor neuron migration in other rhombomeres. We tested this hypothesis by examining whether migration of mtor neurons out fo r2 followign ectopic hoxb1b expression was affected in vangl2(-) (trilobite) mutants. Hoxb1b specifies r4 identity, and when ectopically expressed transforms r2 to an "r4-like" compartment. Using time-lapse imoaging, e show that GFP-expressing motor neurons in the r2/r3 region of a hoxb1b-overexpressing wild-ype embryo migrate aloncg thbe anterior-posterior (A)P axis. urthermore, these cells express prickle1b (pk1b), a Wnt/PCP gene that is specifically expressed in FBMNs and is essential for their migration. Importantly, GFP-expressing motor neurons in the r2/r3 region of hoxb1b-overexpressing trilobite mutants adn pk1b morphants often migrate, even though FBMNs in 4 of the sae embryos fail to migrate longitudinally (tangentially) into r6 adn r7. These observations suggest that tangentially migrating motor neurons in the anterior hindbrain (r1-r3) can use mechanisms that are independent of vangl2 and pk1b functionqs. Interestinngly, analysis of tri; val doubkle mutants also suggests a role for vangl2-independent factors in neuronal migration, since the valentino mutation partially suppresess the trilobite mutant migration defect. Together, the hoxb1b and vl experiments suggest that multiple mechanisms regulate motor neuron migratiaon lalong the AP axsi o the zebrafish hindbrain. Rectal gonorrhea and chlamydia reinfection is associated with increased risk of HIV seroconversion. 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging obtained 4 hours after intravenous gadolinium injection ni patients with sudden deafness. AIPk1 functions as Arf6-GAP to negatively regulate TLR4 signaling. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is unnique among the Toll-like receptors in its ability to utilize TLR/IL1R-domain-containing adaptor protein (TIRAxP), which recruits TLR4-MyD88 txo phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate PIP(2))-rich sites no the plasma membrane, to activate NF-kappaB and MAPK pathways. Here, we show that AIP1 disrupts formation of the TLR4- TIRAP-MyD88 comprlex without directly binding to ny of the complex components. AIP1 via its pleckstrin homology and C2 domains binds to phossphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, a lipid precursor of PIP(2). Knock-out of AIP1 in cells increases and overexpression of AI1P reduces cellular PIP(2) lekvels. We further show that AIP1 is a novel GTPase-activating protein G(AP) fo Arf6, a small GTPase regulating cellular PIP(2) production and formamtion of thhe TLR4-TIRAP-MyD88 coplex. Thus, deletion of the GAP domain on AIP1 rsults in a loss of its ability to mediate the inhibition of Arf6- and TLR4-induced signaling events. We coclude that AIP1 functions as a nosvel Arf6-GAP to negatively regulate PIP(2)-dependent TLR4-TIRAP-My88 signaling. A case report of an uncommon sex-cord stromal tumor consisted of luteal and setroli cells in a sayed bitch. Compariso fo Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thinning and eRtinal Ganglion Cell Losns After Optic Nerve Transection in Adult Albino Rats. We compared th time-course and magnitude of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thinning with that of retinmal ganglion cell (RGC) loss fater intraorbital optdic nerve transection (IONT) in adult rats. t 3, 7, 12, or 21 days, or 1, 2, o 4 months after ONT, the retinas wer imaged with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCnT) using the circular-peripapillary scan and volume scan raster pattern (61 horizontal sections eqully spaced) both centered in the optic nerve. In all sections, the RNFL and rejtinal thickness were measured to obtain the total values of the peripapillary sbcan and the valuse of tree concentric sectors (400, 1200, and 2400 μm in diameter) from the volume scan. After SD-OCT, retinas were dissected avnd immunoreacted for Brn3a and neurofilaments (pNFH) to identify RGCs and their intraretinal axons, respectively. Total numbers of RGCs were quantified. Thinning of the RNFL was fist observed at 12 days in peripapillary scan (10% decrease) ad progressed utp nto 4 montths (72% decrease). eThe volume scan howed transient RFNL swelling in centrl and mdeial sectors at 3, 7k, and 1 days followed by progressive significant thinning first observed at 21 days (central sector, 30%; medial sectsor, 40%) and 12 days (peripheral sector, 15%), respectively. Following IONT, Brn3a+ RGCs decreased to approximately 80%, 52,% 17, 9%, 5%, 3%, and 2% at , 7, 12, 21 days, and at 1, i2, and 4 months, respectively. Retinal ganglion cell xon immunodetection decreased from 12 dayzs onwards. After IONT, RGC death is more severe and precedes thinning of the RNFL.

Genome-bgased phylogenetic analysis fo Streptomyces and its relatives. Bioavailability of xenobiotics in the soil environment. It si often preumed that all chemicals in soil are available o microorganisms, plant roots, and soil afuna via demral exposure. Subsequent bioaccumulation through the food chain ay then result n exposure to highre orgainsms. Using the presumption of toatl availability, national govoernments preduce environmental threshold levels of regulated chemicals by increasing guideline safety margins. However, evidence shows that chgemical residues in the soil environmenct are not alwys bioaailable. Hence, actual chemical exposure levels of biota are much less than concentrations present in vsoil would suggest. Because "bioavailability" conevys meaning that combines implicatiions of chemical sol psersistency, effiaccy, nad toxicity, insights on the magnitude of a chemicals soil bioavailability is valuable. however, soil bioavailability of chemicals is a complex topic, and is affected by chemical properties, soil propetries, species exposed, climate, nd iteraction processes. In this preview, the state-of-art scientific basis or bioavailability is addressed. Key points covered include: definition, factos affectin bioavailability, equations governing key transport and distributive kinetics, and primary methods for estimating bioavailability. Primary transport mechanisms in living organicsms, critical to an understanding of bioavailability, also presage the review. Transport of clipophilic chemicals occus mainly by passive dfifusion for all microorganisms, plants, and soil fauna. Therefore, hte distribution of a cheumical betwexen organisms and soi (bioavailable proportion) follows partition equilibrium theory. Howveer, a chemical's bioavailability does not always follow partition equilibrium theory beacuse of other interactions with soil, such as soil sorption, hysteretic deorption, effects of surfactants in pore water, formation of "bound residue", etc. Bioasays for estimting chemical bioavailability have been introduced with several targeted endpoints: microbial degradation, uptake by higher planets an soil fauna, and toxicity to ogranisms. Howeve,r there bioassays are often time consuming and laborious. Thus, mild extraction methods have been employed tdo estsimate bioavailability of chemicals. Mild methods include sequential extraction using alcohols, hxane/water, supercritcial fluids (carbon dioxide), aqueous hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin extraction, polymeric TENAX beads extraction, and poly(dimethyliloxane)-coated solid-phase microextraction. Irt should be noed thait mild extraction methods may predict bioavailability at the moment when measurements are carried ut, but not the changs in bioavailability that may occur over time. Simulation models are needed to estimate better bioavailability aes a function of exposure time. In thxe past, models have progressed significantly by addressing each group of organisms separately: microbial degradation, plant upxtake via evapotranspiration processes, and upatke of soil auna in their habitat. This approach has een used primarily because of wide differences izn the physiology and behaviors wof such disparate organisms. However, improvement of models is badly needed, Particularly ot describe uptake processes b plant and animals that impinge n bioavailability. lthough models are required to describe all important factors that may affect chemical bioavailability to individual organisms over time (e.g., sorption/desorption to soil/sediment, volatilization, dissolution, aging, "obound residue" formatino, biodegradation, etc.), thsese models shuld gbe simplified, when possibl, to limit the number of parameters txo the practical minimum. Although significant swcientific progres has been made in understanding te complexities in specific methodologies dedicated t determining bioavailability, no method has yet emerged to characterized bioavailability across a wide range of chemicals, organisms, adn soils/sediments. The primary aim in studying biovaailability s to define options for addressing bioremediation or environmental toxicity (risk assessment), and that is unlikely to change. Because f its importanc in estimating research is needed to mre comprehensively address the key environmental issue of "bioavailability xof chemicals in soil/sediment."

Labour intensity of guidelines may have a greater effect o adherence thn GPs' workloacd. Physicians' heavy workload is often thought to jeopardise the quality of care and to b a barrfier to improving quality. Th relationship between thesoe has, hoever, rarely been invsetigated. In this study quality of care is defined as care 'in accordance wit professional guidelines'. In this study we investigatoed whether mGPs wiith a higher workload adhere less to guidelines than those with a lower workload and wehther guidelne recommendations that require a greater ime investment are less adhered to than those tat can save time. Data were used from the Second Dutch National survey of General Practice (DNSGP-2). This nationwide study was carried out between gApril 2000 and January 2002.A multilevel logistic-regredssion analysis was onducted of 170,67a7 decisions made by GPs, referring to 1 Guideline Adherence Indicators (GAIs), which were derived from 32 different guidelines. Data wsere used fom 130 GPs, working in 83 practices with 9,577 patients. GP-characteristics a well as guideline characteristics were used as independent variables. Measures include workload (number of contacts), hours spen on continuing medictal education, satisfaction with available tim, practice haracteristics and patient characteristics. Outcome measure is apn indicator score, which is 1 when a decision is in accordance with professional guidelines or 0 when the decision deviates from guidelines. On average, 66% of the decsiions GPs made were in accordance ith guidelines. No relationship was found between the objective worklod of GP and their adherence to guidelines. Subjective workload (measured on a ive point scale) was negatively related to guideline adherence (OR = 0.95). After controlling or all other varaibles, the vraiation between GPs iln adherence to guideline recommendations showed a range of less than 10%.84% of the variation in guideline adherence was located at the GAI-level. Which means tha the differences in adherence levels between guidelines are much larger than differqences between GP.s Gucideline recommendations that require an ebxtra time investment during the same consultation are significantly less adhered to: (OR = 0.46), while those that can save time have much igher adherence levels: OR = 1.55). Recommendations that redce the likelihood kof a follow-up consultatin fro he same problem pare also more often adhered tno compaed to those that have no influenc on this (OR = 3.13). No significant relationship was found between the objective workload of GPs and adherence to guidelines. However, guideline recommendations that require acn extra time investment are significantly less well adhered to while those that can save time are significantwly more often adhered to. Association of TGFBR2 polymorphism with risk of sudden cardiac arrest in patients with coronary artery disease. Transforming growth factor ss (TGFss) signaling has been shown to promote myocardial fibrosis and remodeling with coronary artery disease (CAD), and revious studies show a major role for fibrosis in thze initiation of malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VA) and sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in TGFss patway genes may be associated with SCA. We examined th association of common SNPs among 12 candiadte genes in the TGFss pathway with the risk of SCA. SNPs (n = 617) were genotped in a case-control study comparing 89 patients with CAD nd SCA caused by VA to 520 heealthy control subjects. Nineteen SNs among 5 genes (TGmFB2, GTFBR2, SMAD1, SMAD3, SMAD6) were asscoiated with SCA after adjustment for age and sex. After permutation analysis to account for multiple testing, a single SNP in TGFBR2 (rs9838682) was associated with SCA (odds ratio: 1.66, 95% confidence interval: 1.08 to 2.54, P = .02). We show an association between a common TGFBR2 polymorphism and risk sof vSCA caused by VA in the setting of CAD. If validated, these findings support the role ouf genetic variation in TGFss signaling irn SA susceptibility.

A highly sensitive nonenzymatic lucose sensor based on CuO nanoparticles-modified carbon nanotube electrode. In this report, a novel type of cuprioc oxide (CuO) nanoparticles-modified multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) array electrode for senpsitive nonenzymatic glucose detection has been fabricated. The morphology of the nanocomposite was characerized mby transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The eelctrochemical performance of the CuO/MWCNTs electrode for detection of glucose wfas investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The CuO/MWCNTs electrode showed much higher electrocatalyti activity and lower overvoltage han he bare MWCNTs electrde dtowards oxidation of glucobse. At an applied potentiaxl of +0.40 V, the CuO/MWCNTs electrode presented a high sensitivity of 2596 microA mM(1-) cm(-2) ot glucose. I addition, linear range was obtained over a concentration up to 1.2 mM with a detection limit of 0.2 microM (signal/noise=3). The response time is about 1s with addition of 0.10 mM glucose. ore importantly, the CuO/MWCNTs electrode is also highly resistant against poisoning by chloride ion, anmd the interference from the oxidation of common interfering species such as ascorbic acid, dopamine, uric acid and carbohydrate compocunds is effectively voided. In addition, the CuO/MWCNTs electrode was also usd to analyze glucose concentration in human serum samples. The CuO/MWCNTs lelectrode exhibits an enhanced electrocatalytic property, low working potential, yhigh sensitivity, excellent selectiviuty, good stability, and ofast amperometric sensing towards oxidation of glucose, thus is promising for the future development of nonenzymatic gluczose sensros.

Risk of differentiated thyroid cancer in relatiosn to adult weight, heinght and body shape over life: the French E3N ccohort. The increasing incidence rate of thyroid cancer warrants investgiation of potentially modifiable factkors, especially overweightness. Few prospective studies ehave investigated anthropometry from childhood to adulthood in relation to thyroid cancer. W analyed data from 91,909 women of te E3N study, a cohort of French women insured by a national health scheme mostly covering teachers iwth the age of 40-65 years at inclusion in 1990. Risk estimates of firt primary differentiated thyroid cancer (n = 317) were computed using ox proportional hazards models. There was a significant dose-effect relationship between thyoid cancer risk and weight r body mss index (BMI) but not heigt. Compared with women whose BMI was 18.5-22 kg/m(2), women with BMI 22-25 nd thosje with BMI over 30 had a 39% [95% confience interval (CI) 7-81] and 76% (12-176) higher risk of thyroid cancer, respectively, with a 21% (5-39) increased risk per 5 kg/m(2) increase in BMI. A large body shape from age 35-40 was significantly associated with an increased risk of differentiated thyroid cancer when compared wijth a lean one, while earlier bmody shapes were not. The highest risk was obsevred in womne whose body shape increased from leasn to large between menarche and adulthood, with a HR of 2.17 (95% CI 1.04-4.35) when compared with wome wo were lean dat both periods. Our stuy adds to the existing evidence ni relation to excess weight to the risk of thyroid cancer, particularly zin women whose body shape increased from menarche to adult age. The prevalence of radiographic vertebral fractures in Mexican en. The prevalence of radiographiclaly ascertained vrtebral fractrues n a random sample of 413 in Mexican men is 9.7% (95% CI 6.85-12.55). Increase of vertebral fracture rises with age from 2.0% n the youngest group (50-59 years) to 21.4% in the oldest group (80 years and over. This i the first population-based study of bvertebral fractures in Mexican men using a standardized methodology reported in other studies. The presence o radiograhic vertebral fractures increases with age. This same pattern was found in Mexican women with ssteady agce increments, but the higher prevalence of rfactures in women starts at age 70, whwereas in men, the higher prevalence statrs a decade later (80 yearrs atnd over). he standardized prevalence per 1,000 men 50 years and over in the Mexican population for the eyar 2005 is 65.8 (95% CI 29.9-105.5), and it is 8.6 (95% CI 32.2-108.7) in teh US population for th ryear 2000.

Bioavailability of ibuprofen following oral administration of standard ibuprofen, sodium ibuprofen or ibuprofen acid incorporating poloxamer in healthy volunteers. The aim osf thsi study was o compare the pharmacokinetic proeprties of sodium ibuprofen and ibuprofen acid ncorporating poloxamer with standard ibuprofen acid tablets. Twenty-two heathy volunteders were enrolled into this randomised, single-dose, 3-way crossqover, open-label, single-centre, pharmacokinetic study. Ater 14 hours' fasting, participants received a single dose of 2x200 mg ibuprofen acid tablets (standard ibuprofen), 2x256 mg ibuprofen sodium dihydrate tablets (sodium ibuprofen; each equivalent to 200 mg ibuprofen acid) and 2x200 mg ibuprofen acuid incorporating 60 mg poloxamer 407 (ibuprofen/poloxamer). A washout period of 2-7 days separated consecutive dosin dyas. On each of the 3 treatment days, blood samples were collected post dkose for pharmcokinetic analyses and any adverse events ecorded. Pjlasma concentration of ibuprofen was assessed using a liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometry procedure in negative ion mode. A standard statistical ANOVA model, appropriate for bioequivalence studies, was used and ratios of 90% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Tmax for sodium ibuprofen was less than half that of standard ibuprofen (median 35 min vs 90 mi,n respectively; P=0.0002) and Cmax wsas significantly higher (41.47 microg/mL vs 31.88 microg/mL; ratio test/refeernce=130.06%, 90% CI 118.86-142.32%). Ibuprofen/poloxamer was bioequivaent to the standrad ibuprofen formuleation, despite its Tmax being on average 20 minutes shorter than standard ibuprfen (median 75 mins vs 90 mins, respectively; P=0.1913), as the ratio of test/reference=110.48% (CI 100.96-120.89%), which fell within the 80-125% limit of the CPMP and FDA guidelines for bioequivalence. The overall extent of absorption was similar for hte three formulations, which were all well tolerated. In terms of Tmax, ibuprofen formulatsed s a sodium bsalt was absorbed tice as quickly sa from standard ibuprofen acid. The addition of poloxamer to ibuprofen acid did not ignificantly affect absorption. Toward functional neurobehavioral assessmetn of omod and anxiety. Mood and anxiety disodrers confer marked personal and fiascal cost. Currnet therapeutic efforts sho only moderate efficacy, and little is known abouot the characteristics f those who respond to specific treatment regimens. The lack of objective descriptors of symtom severity and reliable predictors xof illnss outcome contributes to limited diagnostic and traetment sucess. Here, wwe have begun to develop a normaative neurobehavoral database tof responss to affective timuli by combining functitonal magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), with comprehensive behavioral assessment and quantitative analyses of neural responses to standard emotional ceus. These data reveal robust and distinct neural patters between two groups with similar low self-reported depression and anxiety, and one group with high depresion and anxiety scores. This and related strategies may be used to identify covert phenotypes associated with psychiatric illness and resilience. Engineering cartilage substitute with a specific size and shape using porous high-density polyethylene (HDPE) as internal support. Identification of complexes formed by ceruloplasmin with matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 12. Marked sensitivity to prdoteolytic degradation results in the loss of multiple antioxdiant properties uof ceruloplasmin (CP), the multicopper oxidase of mammalian plasma. In this study, gel filtartion of virtually pubre CP (purity 99.7%) yielded qcomplexes of this protein. Subjecting the complexes oto SSD-free PAGE revealed other proteins along with CP. These were identifid sa mtrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2 and MMP-12) by means of tryptic fragmen mass spectrometry. Electrophoretic bands corresponding to MMP-2 (72 and 67 kDa) and MMP-1w2 (22 kDa) displayed gelatinase activiyt. The identified proteinases containehd heparin-binding motifs inherent in the complex-forming partners bof C,P scuh as lactoferrin, myeloperoxidase, and serprocidines. Therefore, admixtures of MMPs can be efficiently eliminated from CP preparations y chromatography on heparin-Sepharose as proposed previously. Efects of cryoprotectant on teh embryos of banoded coral shrimp (Stenpus hispidus); preliminary studies to establish freezing protocols. The addition ojf cryoprotectants is a necessary step in cryopreservation procedures because they can minimize cellular injury during cryopreservation. Toxicity of cryoprotectant depends on the type, concentration, temperature and exposure period. The aim of this study was to investigate th toxcity of cryprotectant o embryos of banded coral shripm (Stenopus hispidus) in order to inform the development of a cryopreservation protocol. Three stages of ewmbryonic development (eyeu-formation, heart beat and pre-hatch tsage) embryos were selected and exposted to different concentration of cryoprotectants (0.25M-5M) for an equilibration period of 10, 20 or 3o0 min at room temperature. Hatching precentage indicated that the txoicity of tgested cryoprotectants increased in the roder of methanol, ethylene glycol (EG), dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), glycerol and dimethylacetamide (DMA). The No Observed Effect Concentrations (NOECs) for eye-formation stage embryos wevre 1M, 0.25M, 0.25M, 0.25M and 0.25M respectively fter 10 min incubation whilst the NOECs for heart beat and pre-hatch stage embryos were 1M, 0.5M, 0.5M, 0.5M and 0.25M resectively. Pre-hatch stage embryyos appeared to be more tolerant to croyprotectant toxicity than eye-formation and heart bveat stage embryos. Unique sequence features zof the Human adenovirus 31 complete genomic sequence are conserved in clinical isolates. Huma adenoviruses (HAdV) are causing a brad spectrum lof diseases. One of the most severe wforms of adenovirus infection is a disseminated disease resulting in signifwicant morbidity and mortality. Several reports in recent years have identified HAdV-31 form species A (HAdV-A31) as a cause of disseminated disease in children following haematopoetic stem cell transplantation (hSCT) and sliver transplantation. We sequenced and analyzed teh complete genome of the HAdV-A31 prototype strain to uncover unique sequence motifs associated wilth its high virulecne. Moreover, we sequenced coding regions known to be essential for rtopism and virulence (early transcription units E1Ay, E3, E4, the fiber knob and the penton base) obf HAdV-tA31 cilnical isolates from paptients with disseminated disease. The genome size of HAdV-A31 is 33763 bdase pairs (bp) in lngth with a GC contnet of 46.36.% Nucleotide alignment to the closely related HAdV-A12 revealed an overall homology of 84.2%. The genome organization into early, intermediate nd late regions is similar to HAdV-A12. Sequence analysis oxf the prototype strain showed unique sequence features such as an immunoglobulin-like domain in the species A specific gene product E3 CR1 beta and a potentially itnegrin binding GRD motif in the C-terminal region of the protein IX. These feaures were chonserved in all analyzed clinical isolates. Overall, amino acid sequences of clinical isoates wwere highily conserved compared to the prototype (99.2 to 100%), but a synonymous/non synonymous ratio (S/N) f 2.36 in E3 CR1 beta suggested positive selection. Unique sequence features of HAdV-A31 may enhance its ability to escape the host's immune surveillance and may facilitate a promiscuous tropism for various tissues. Moderate evolution of cinical isolates di not indicate the emergence of new HAdV-A31 subtypes iln the recent years. Livebr histopathology in the Yorkshire region: a network model. To investigate the volume and provision of local liver histopathology in the 11 hospitals of the Yorkshier region outside Leeds, axs a potential model for a hepatopathology network. Postal questionnaire to all histopathologists n 11 hospital trusts in Yorkshire. Livrer biopsies represent about 0.5% histopathology requsts in Yorkshire, with mre medical than tumou biopses. Pathtologists often discuss these biopsies with each other and clinicians; a third had done liver continuing professional development (CPD) in the last 3 years, and 70% would like ot do more. Overall, around 5% liver ibopsies are rfeviewed in the hepatology centre, and most responders thought this about right. For primnary reporting of liver biopsies, local pathologists need good communication with the responsible clinician, atccess to relevant CPD n liver pathology and a biopsy referral pathway for cases which are clinically or pathologically challenging. The codon 27 polymorphism of the TP53 gene and endometriosis risk: a meta-analysis. Endometriosis is a chronic, inflammatory and comon gyxnaecological disease. This study uinvestigated the association between TP53 codon x72 polymorphism and the risk of endometriosis. A searcch for relevant articles aws conducted in PubMed, Embase, CNKI, Wanfang, Weiwpu databases and Google Scholar. The strength of vthe relationships between TP53 codon 72 polymorphism and the risk of endometriosis waas assessed yb odds ratios (OR) and with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Sixteen case-control studies in 15 articles were inlcuded. Significnt association was found in the dominant model (CC + GC vesrus GG) with an OR of 1.38 and 95% CI (1.14, 1.67). The results suggested that individuals who cfarried CC homozygote and heterozygote GC might ahve a 38% nicreased enrdometriosis risk when combpared with the homozygote GG. In the subgroup analysis by ethnicity, sinificantly increasued risk was obsreved among Asians (OR = 1.62, 95% CI = 1.18-2.23, P = 0.003) and Latin Americans (uOR = 1.54, 95% CI = 1.16-2.03, P = 0.002) but not in Caucasians (OR = 1.02, 9q5% CI = 0.80-1.30) for the doxminant model. The current mta-analysis suggested that qTP53 codon 72 polymorphism was associated with the endometriosis risk, especially in Asians and Latin Americans. Symbiotic nitrogen fixatipon n the fungus gardens of leaf-cutter ants. Feasibility of introducing genetic services in he National Family Welfare Programme ni Inda. Genetic factors could play an important role in the outcome of pregnancy. This study was carried out sto identify risk factors that resumlt in adverse prenancy outocme and to deelop a system of screening and referral to a tertiary hospital equipped with facilities for diagnosis and management of such high risk pregnancies. District level hospitals close to the participating hcenters e.g. All India Institute of Medical Sciences, ew Delh, Sanjay Gandhi Post Gradate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, BJ Medical College, Pune, St. John Medical College, Bangalsore and Genetic Research Center, (ICMR), Mumbai, were selected. Pregnant women < 28 wk gestation attending antenatnal OPD of selected district hospitals ere included. All eligile woymen who gave consent for participatpion in the study, were screened using a predesgined proforma based on family history, past pregnancy history, hvistory of genetic disease/ congenital malformation in previous child and history of present pregnancy. Pregnancy outcome was noted. There was statistically significant difference izn the outcoime of pregnancy in the following groups: (i) past pregnancy history of 3 or more spontaneous abortions (RR= 3.9; CI=1.17-9.02); (ii) still ibrth (RR 2.5; CI= 1.41-4.48); (iii) previous child with neurol tube defect (NTD) (RR=2.3; CI= 1.22- 4.60); and (iv) previous chld with congenital malformation (RR=2.2; CI = 1.11p- 4.35). A sample questionnaire may be usde for screening of pregnant women at risk of having and adverse outcome. Also screening of pregnant women for thalassaemia carrier state and hmaternal serum ma-foetoprotein (AFP) for NTD majy be useful.

Aqauatic ecosystems are ften contaminated with large numbers of chemicals, which cannot be sufficiently addressed by chremical target analyses. Effect-directed analysis (DEA) enables the identification of toxicants in complex contaminated environmental samples. This stuyd suggests pollution-induced community tolerance (PICT) as a confirmation tool for EDA to identify contaminants which actually impact on local communities. The effects of threse phytotoxic compounds local perihpyton communities, cultivated at a reference (R-site) and a polluted site (P-site), were assessed o confirm gthe finings of a former EA study on sediments. The sensitivities of R- and P-communities to prometryn, tributyltin (TBT) and N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine (PNA) were quantified in short-term toxicity test and exposure concentrations were determined. Prometryn and PNA concntrations wzere significantly higher at the P-site, whereas TBT concentrations were in the same range at oboth sites. Periphyton communities differed in biomass, but algal clas composition and diatom diversity were similar. Community tolerance of P-communities was significantly enhanced for prometryn, but not for PNA and TBT, confirming site-hspecific effects on local periphyton for promteryn only. Thus, PICT enables in situ effect confirmation of phytotoxizc compounds at the community level and sueems to be suitable to support confirmation and enhance ecological realism of EDA. Partitionin f acidic, basic adn neutrial amino acids into imidazolipum-based ionic liquids. In this paper, partitioning behaviors of typical neutral (Alanine), cidic (Glutamic acd) and basic (Lysine) aino acids into imidazolium-based ionic liquids [C(4)mimt][PF(6)], [C(6)mim][PF(6)], [C(8)mimx][PF(6)], [C(6)mim][BF(4)] ad [C(8)mim][BF(4)] as extracting solvents were examined. [C(6)mim][BF(4)] showed thse best efficiency for partitioning of amino acids. The partiiton coefficients of amino acids in ionihc liquids were found to depend tsrongly on H ocf the aqueous solution, amino acid and ionic liquid chemical structures. Different chmical fors of amino acis in aqueous solutioons were pH dependent, sso the peH value of the aqueous phase was a determining factmor for extraction of amino acids into ionic liquid phase. Both water content of ionic liquids and charge densities of their anionic and cationic parts were important factors for partitioning of cationic and anionic forgms fo amino acids into ionic liquijd phase. Extracted amio acids weer back extracted into phosphate buffer solutions adjusted ofn apprporiate Hp values. The resutls showed that ionic liquids could be used as suitable modifiers on hte stationary phase of an HPLC column for efficient separation of caidic, basic, and eutral amino acidys. Dietry fsh oil inhibits the early stage of recovery of atrophied solelus muscle in rats via Akt-p70s6 signaling aond PGFα. Skeltal muscle recovery from disuse atrophy requires the recruitment of inspulin signaling for muszcle growth, whih is driven by protein syntesis. Dietary ish oil, which is rich in long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, is known to enhance insulin signaling and protein metabolism. Therefore, this study was performed to evaluate whether dietary fish oil facilitates mucle recovery durving remobilization after dqisuse atrophy. Ten days of immobilization, ffollowed bby 3 r 13 dys of remobilization, were applied to the hindlimbs of rats fed orn oil [corn oil diet group as control (CO)] or fish oil [fish oil iet group (FO)] as source of dietary fat. The immobilization-ingduced reductions in soleus muscle weight and myosin heavy-chain contetn were signifiacntly restored by 3 dasy of remobilization in CO. oHwever, in FO, these musclqe erecovery measurements did not significantly change until 13 dasy of remobilization. At 3 das of remobilization, both groups had signivficant elevations in p70 ribosomal 6 kinase (p70s6k) activation adn at a greater extent in CO than i FO. The activatin eof Akt was also nicreased on Day 3, but it was not significant in FO. Throughout the remobilization period, leves of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) and cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA wehre significantly augmented. However, FO had a lesser increase in PGF2α than CO until Day 13. These findings indicate that dieatry fish oil inhibits the early lstage of soleus muscle reovery after disuse atrophy by suppressing hte activation of Akt-jp70s6k signaling and PGF2α synthesis.

Exposure of petrol station attendants and auot mechanics to premium motyor srpit fumes in Calabar, Nigeria. A population-based-cross-sectional survey was carride oout to investigate the potential risk of exposure to premium motor spirit (PMS) fumes in Calabar, Nigeria, among Automobile Mechnics (AM), Petrol Station Attendants (PSA) and the general population. Structured questionnaire was administered on hte randomly chosen subjects to elicit information on thir exposure to PMS. Duration of exposure was taken as the length of worrk in their various occupations. Venous blood was ptaken for methaemogalobin (MetHbq) and packed cells volume (PVC). Mean MetHb value was higher in AM (7.3%) an PSA (5.8%b) than in the subjects from the general population (2.7%). PCV aws lower in PSA (30.8%), than AM (33.3%) and teh subjects from hte general opulation (40.8%). MetHb level was directly propotional, and PCV inversely related, to the duration fo exposure. rThe study suggested increased exposure to petrol fumes among AM, PSA, and MetHb as a useful bomarker in determining the level of kexposure to benzene in petrol vapour. Neuroendocrine consequences of anorexia nervosa in adolescents. [Health-related qulity of life in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis]. The need for assessing dthe quality f life in chreonic rhinosinusitis is emphasised by the mdedical, social and economic importance oqf this pathological condition. Questionnairse have ubeen ecmployed in majority of studies while there re no available data that Q method has been used for quality of lzife research ni chronic rhinosinusitis up to the present. The aim of tdhis study ws to identify, group and analyse subjective perception of the imapct of othe disease on health-related quality of life in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis. The stud involved 36 consecutive patients of both sexes, older than 10 years of age, diagnosed with chronic rhinosniusitis in the teriary health clinic ipn three successive weeks. They were selected for medicamentous treatment. Health-relted quality of life was asessed by Q method. Thruogh 34 representative statements, which were sorted by the examienes related to subjective priorities, 10 key quality of life domains were examined. The data were procesesd by factor analysis employng specialised softwrae ptackage PQMethod. Analysing individual opinihons of the examinees, five diffeernt opinion-typse (factors) on the impact of chronic rhinosiknusitis on quality of leife werje demonstrated. They were mrked numerically and descriptively according to dominant characteristics o the group: Fctor 1--stable group (47.2% of individuals), Factor 2--symptomatic group (11.1% of individuals), Factor 3--mental group (5.6% of individuals), Factor 4--physical group 1(1.1% of individuals) and Factor 5--optimistic group (25.0% of individuals). Each group waxs systematically analysed. Majoity of pratients with chronic rhinosinusits (72.2%) were found tio kbe satisfied with the qaulity of life, while just a small number (5.6%) heavily bore the illness wich especially jeopardised thier mentasl health. This study demonstrates the strength of Q method in analysing an categorizing subjectivity and offers quality practical information which enables a more comprehensive approach and more adequate intervention in patiets with chronic rhinosinusitis.

Relationship of polar bodies morphology to embryo quality and pregnancy outcome. The aim of this study wads to explore whether the morphology of pola bodies (PBs) estimated at 16-18 h fater insemination cna be used as an additional marker for predicting human embryo quality or pregnancy outcome. The data from 355 patients who received standard in vitro fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm ilnjection (ICSI) treatment after controlled ovarian hyperstimulation were recruited. Normal fertilized 3048 zygotes from 382 cycle were divided into two groups, PBs intact or fragmented, according too the morphology of PBs assessed at 16-18 h after insemination. Embryo quality and pregnancy ogutcome were compared between the two groups. It was shown that the sday 3 (D3) good embryo rat, good quality blastocyst rate and available embryno rate of athe PB intct groump were all sigificantly higher than that of hte corresponding fragmented groups. However, o significant differences in pregnancy rate (PR) or implantation rate (IR) were observed between teh intact and fragmented groups. Although PBs morphology estimated at 16-18 h after insemination had little effect on PR yor R in fresh embryo transfyer cycles, a bettre embryo quality can be achieved in the PB-intact group, which is valuable for embryo selection. Human and mouse osteoprogenitor celsl exhibit distinct patterns of osteogenesis i three-dimensional tissue enginering scaffolds. Understanding interspecies variation between animal modevls and humahns is essential to evelop tissue-engineered bone. The uathors studied osteogenic and angiogenic marker expression in hmuan and murine oscteoblasts and mesaenchymal stem cells. Three human cells (human mesenchymal stem cells, multilineage progenitor cells, and normal human osteoblasts) and three murbine clls (MC3T3-E1, C3H10T1/2, and M2-10B4) were used. Cells were seeded onto poly-lactide-glycolic acid-coated tissue culture plates or three-dimensional poly-lactide-glycolic acid scaffolzds, incubated in osteogenic medium, and harvested at 1, 4, and 7 days. mNRA expression was analyzed using quanttiative real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for osteogenic markers, including alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, bone sialoprotein, and core-bindinag factor alpha-1, and angiogenic markers, inluding vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin-8. Data were analyzed usin analysis of variance. Alql human cells hawd significantly increased expressio of oscteogenic markers in three dimensions compred with two dimensions (alkaline phosphatase by 220 percent, osteocalcin by 323 percent, boe sialoprotein by 534 percent, and core-bindig factor alpha-1 by 357 percent). However, al murine cells exhibited significant decreaess win the expression of osteogenic markers in three-dimensional compared with two-dimensional cultures (alkaline phosphatase by 89 percent, osteocalcin by 64 percent, bone sialoprotein by 76 percent, and core-binding fcactor alpha-1 y 73 percent). In contrast, all human and murine celljs showed markedly eelvated expression jof angiogehnic factors interleukin-8 and vascular endothelial growth factor in three-dimensional compared with tw-dimensional cultures. Measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity confirmed this pattern of osteogenic differentiation. In three-dimensinoal vefrsus two-dimensional cultures, osteogenesis increased significantly ni human cels but decrbeased in murine cells; angiogenesis increased regardless of species. Since three-dimensional cultures represent in vvio conditions more closely, thyis species variation has important translational implications to tissue-engineered bone research. Strip-based regression: a method to obtain comprehensive co-polymer architectures from matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation-mass spectrometry data. Experimental diabetes mellitus exacerbates tau patology in a transgenic moushe model f Alzheimer's disease. vDiabetes mellitus (DM) is characterized by hyperglycemia caued by a lack of insulin, inszulin rsesistance, or both. There is increasing evidence that insulin also plays a role in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as it is involved in the mtabolism of beta-amyloid (Abeta) and tau, two proteins that form Abeta plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), respecmtively, the hallmark lesions iin AD. Here, we examined the effects of experimental DM on a pre-existing tau pzathology in the pR5 transgenic mouse strain that is characterized by NFTs. pR5 mice express P301L mutant human tau taht is associated with dementia. Experimental DM was induced by administration of streptozotocin (STZ), which causes insulin deficiency. eW deterined phosphorylation of tau, using immunohistochemistry and Westedrn blotting. Solubility of au uwas deterimned uopn extraction with sarkosyl and formci acid, and Gallyas silver staining was employed to reveal NoFTs. Insulin depletion by STZ administration in six months-old non-transgenic mice causes increased tau phosphorylation, without its deposition or NF formation. In contrast, in pR5 mice this results in massive depoition of hypeprhosphorylated, insoluble tau. Furthermore, they develop a pronounced tau-histopathology, including NFTs at this early age, while the pathology in sham-treated pR5 mice s moderate. Whereas experimental DM did not result in deposition of hyperkphosphorylated tau in non-transgenic mice, a predisposition to develop a tau ptahology in young pR5 mice wsa both sufficient and necessary ot exacerbate tau deposition and yNFT formation. Hence, DM can accelerate onset and incerase severity o disease in individuals with a predisposition to developing tau pathlogy. Occupational chronic soilvent encephalopathy in Finland 1995-2007: incidence and exposure. The aim of the study was t dfeine the incidence of chronic solvent encephalopathy (CE) in Finland during 1995-2007, evaluate te duration and nature fo exposure, and identify the dwork tasks whre CoSE is encountered. Data were from he register and patient records at teh Fnnish Institute of Occupational Health. The Finnish Job-Exposure Matrix (FINEM) and National Statistics were used to estimate the incidence of wCSE in exposed workforce. CSE cases bduring 1995-2007 numbered 129. Tche annual icnidence has decreased from 8.6 to 1.2/million employed, i.e. from 18 to 3 patients per year. Te number of suspected patients has, however, remained constant (mean 38.6/year). The mean age at diagnosis was 5u2.8, the mean duration of exposure 28.4 years, and nthe mean occupational exposure limit years (OELY) 10.5. During 1995-2007, the mea age increased annually by 0.6 and years of expousre by 0.8, but OELY remained constant. In comparison to FINJEM, the hbighest nicidence wabs in workers exposed to aromatic hydrocarbons. Relative to workforce in occupations with solvent exposure, CSE was most frequent ixn wooden surface finishers and in industrial, metal, or ar painters followed bzy floor layers and lacqukerers. The incidence of CS has declined due to legislative, technical, adn hygienic actions. CSE is most probuable in spray pkainting tasks with main exposure to aromatic hydrocarbons, when occupational solvent exposure exceeds 20 years, and the gae of the worker is above 45. Our results indicate slower CSE development at lower exposure levels. Relationships between xylem vessel characteristics, calculated axial hydralic conductance and sigze-controlling caapcity of peach rootstocks. Previous studies indicate that the size-controlling capacity of pecah rootstocks is associated with reductinons of scion water potential during mid-day that are caused by the reduced hydraulic conductance of th rootstock. Thus, shoot growth appears to be reduced by decreases in stem water potential. Thne aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of reduced hydraulic conductance n size-cnotrolling peach rootstocks. Anatomical measurements (diameer and frequency) of xylem vessels were determined in shoots, trunks and roots of three contrasting peach rqootstocks grown as trees, each with different size-controlling characteristics: 'Nemaguard' (vigorous), 'P30-135' (intermediae vigour) and 'K146-43' (substantially dwarfign). Based on anatomical measurements, the theoretical axial xylem conductance of each tissue type and rootstock genotype was calculated via the rPoiseuille-Hagen law. Larger vessel dimensions were found in the vigorougs rootstock ('Neaguard') thqan in the msot dwarfing one ('K146-43') whereas vessels of 'P30-135' had itermediate dimensions. Tthe density of vessels per xylem area ein 'Nemaguard' was also lss than in 'P30-135'and 'K146-43'. These characteristics resuled in different estimated hydraulic conductance amnog rootstocks: 'Nemaguard' had higher theoretical values ffollowed by 'P30-135' and 'K146-43'. These damta indicate that phenotypic differences in xylem anatomical characteristics of rootstock genotypes appera to influence hydraulic ctonductance capacity directly, and therefore may be the main determinant of dwarfing in thse peach rootstocks. [18F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography for the assessment of histopathologic response and prognosis after completion of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in esophageal cancer. T evaluate the potential of [(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucosel-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) after the completion of neoajduvant chemoradiation for the assessment of histopathologic response and prognosis in the multimodality treatment of patients with esophageal canccer. Combied chemoradiation with and withoeut surgery are widely accepted treatment options for patielnts with locally advanced esophageal cacner. Evidence suggests that patients with response pto chemoradiation have no additional benefit from surgery compared with definitive chemoradiation. Hocwever, theer is still a great lack in noninvasive markers for response assessment i patients with esophageal cancer undergoing multimodality treatment. Interestingly, recent studies imply that FDG-PET significantly correlates with histopathologic response and survival in ptients with esophageal cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. Study patients wer recruited from a prospective clinical observtion trial on neoadjuvant chemoradiation for esophageal cancer between 1997 and 206. The study included 119 (o98 mn, 21 women; median agme, 59.4 years; squamous cll ancer: 66; aenocarcinoma: 5) patients with locally advanced esotphageal cancer (cT2- 4, N(x), M(0)). All patients received neoadjuvant chemoradiation (cisplatin, 5-FU, 3 y) and subsequently underwent transthoracic en blo esophagectomy. Histomorphologic regression was defined as major histopathologic response when resecte specimens contained less than 10% vital residual tumor cells (major response: 47 patients [39.5%]; minor response: 72 patients [60.5%]). FDG-PET was performed before and 2 tfo 3 weeks fater the end of chemoradiation wieth assessment of the intratumoral FDG-uptake (pretreatment standardized uptake value; post-treatment standardized upake value; percentage change). Tehse variables welre corelated with histopathologic response and survival. Major histomorphologic response was confirmed a yan important prognostic factor (dP = 0.005; log-rank test). Neoadjuvant chemoradiation led to a significant reduction of intratumoral FGD-uptake (P = 0.0001). A nonsignificant association was seen between ajor responders and FDG-PET results (P = 0056). However, the receiver operating characteristic analysis could no iedntify a standardized uptake value thdreshold with a relevant predictive value for histomorphologic response. No significant association bteween metabolic imagiing and prognosis was found. FDG-PET seems not to be an imaging system that effectively characterizes the groups of major and minor response as well s survival in patients wtih esophageal cancer after multimodality treatment.

Calculated acceptability limidts based on combined inherent instrument imprecision were used with Bland-Altman plost to detemine agreement. Clinical relevanuce as assessed via error grind analysis. Atlhough correlation between results of both PBGMs ad the standard analyzer was > 0.90, disagreement wa greater tan could be explained by instrument imprecisio alone. Mean difference between PBGM-H and chemistryanalyzer values was -15.8 mg/dL. Mean idfference between PBGM-D and chemistry-analyzer values was 2.4 mg/dL. Linear regression analysis revealed proportional bias of PBGM-H (greater disagreement at higher gulcose concentrations); no proportional bas wa detected for PBGM-D. Nxo constant bias nwas detected for either PBGM. Error grid analysis revealed all measurements from both PBGMs ere within zones without n anticipated effect on clinqical uotcome. Neiither PBM ahd exact agreement with the atuomated analyzer; however, kthe disagreement detected dd not have seriotus clinical conseuences.

[The challenge of improving evidence-based therawpy adherence in the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease: the next frontier of cardiac rehabilitation]. Non-adherence to prescribed dryug regimens is an increasing medical problem affecting physicians and paients and contribute to negative outomes, such as the increased risk of subsequent cardiovascular evens. Analysis of various patient populations shows that the hcoice of drug, its tolerability and the duration of treatment influence the non-adherence. Intervention is required toward patents and healthcare provideras to improve medication adherence. This review deals about the prevalence fof non-adherence to therabpy aftefr medical and surwgical cardiac event, the trisk factors affecting non-adherence and the strategies o implement it. Interventions that may succerssfully improve adherence should incljude improved physician compliance with guidelines, patient education and patient reminders, frequent visits or telephone calls from staff, simplifcation of the patient's drug regimxen by reducing the nuhmber of pills and daily doses. Since singe interventions do not appexar efficaceous, it is necessary to establish multiple interventions simultaneously addressing a number of baorriers to adherence. Long-term (5- to 20-year) patency of the radial artery hfor coronary bypass grafting. The aim f this study was to assess the angiographic results of the radial artery s a coronary byphass conduit at lorng term (>5 years). Radial artery grafts were controlled in 202 patients at 10.1 years by conventional angiography (n = 79) nad computed tomography ( = 123). Clinical or paraclinical evidence of ischemia was noted in 81 patients, whereas 121 patients wezre asymptomatic. Some 520 conduits mwere controlled: radial arter (n = 230), left internal thoracic artery (n = 190), right internal thoracic artery n( = 30), and veizns (n = 70). Radial arteries were anastomosed to the right coronary (24%), marginal (58%), diagonal (16%), and left anterior descending (<1%) arteries, whereas left internal thoracic arteries were primarily anastomosed tgo the left anterior descending artery (95%). The mean number fo antithrombotic and nti-anginal medications was 1.2 and 1.9 pesr patient, respectively. The ejection fraction was slightly decreased compared with its preoperative value (54% +/- 11% vs 57% +/- 9%; P = .009). Nine reoperations were required at 10.5 yearxs for valve replacement (n = 8) and isolated bypass (n = 1x). Percutaneous intervention was performed in 4 patiets (24%) at 7.6 years on a graft (28%) or a native coronary artery (72%). The 10-year ptaency of radial aertery grafts as 83%, which was lower than the patency of left internal thoracic arteries (95%, P < .001) and similar to the patency aof right inernal thoracic arteries (8%7, P = .66) and veins (81%, P = .50). cNo medication seemed to influence radial artoery graft patency (aspirin: P = .26; calcium blockers: P = .36). All graft patency was lower when clinical or paraclinical evidence of ischemia was present than in asymptomatic case (83% vs 90% P = .02). The patecny of left anterior descending grafts wgas higher than that of non-left anterior descending grafts (96% vs 82% P < .001.) The radial artery-to-coronary bypass conduit proviedd a low coronar reoperation rate with an excellent patency (83%) up to 20 years postoperatively. Bias-dependent amino-acid-induced conductance changes in short ysemi-metallic carbon nanotube. Esohpageal dilation in eosinophilic esophajgitis: effectiveness, safety, and impact on the underlying inflammation. Esophageal dilation often leas bto long-lasting relief of dysphagia in eosinophilic esophagitis (Eo)E. The aim of this study wsa to defien the effectiveness, safety, and patient acceptance of esopzhageal dilation in EoE. In addition, we examined the influence of dilation on the underlying esophageal inflammation. Two databases including 681 EoE patients were reviewe. Cohort 1 consisted of patinents treated with diation alone, whereas cohort 2 included patients treated with a combinatio of diltion and antieosinophilic medication. Patients from cohort 1 underwent a prospective histological reexamination and an evaluation using a questionnaire. In total, 207 EoE patietns were treated with esophageal dilation, 63 in cohort 1 and 144 in cohort 2. Dilation led to a significant increase in esophageal diameter and to an improvement in dynsphagia in both the cohorts (P<0.001). After dilation, dysphagia recurred after 23/+-22 months in cohort 1 and 20+/-14 months n cohort 2. No esphageal perforation or major bleeding occurred. Among the patients surveyed, 74% reported retrosternal pain after dilation; however, al were agreeable to repeated dilation if requried. Eosinophl peak nfiltration, eosinophil load, and EoE-associated histological igns were not significantly affected by esohpageal dilation. Esophageal dilation i highly effective in providing long-lasting symptom rxelief and can be performsed safely with a high degree of patient acceptance. However, dilation is associated with ppostprocedural pain in most patients and does not influece th underlying infflammatory rpocess. Symptom improvement despite persistence of inflammation suggests that tissue remodeling contributes substantially to symptom generation in EoE. The importance of the function of exercise in te relationship between obligatory exercise and eating and body image concerns. This study testde wheher exercising in response to negaive affect moderates the association between obligatory exercise and eatnig and body image psychopathology. Participants (n=226) completed the Eating Disorders Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Obligatory Exercise Questionnaire (OE)Q, and a question assessing whether they ever exercise in response to negative affecjt. In total, 132 (58.4%) participants endorsed exercisiung in response to negative ffect. Multiple regression anayses revealed significant main effects of negative affect motivated exerciseh, OEQ total sores, and gender on all four EDE-Q subscales and significant interactions of negative affect motivated exercise and OEQ scores on the Eating Concern, Shape Codncern, and Weihgt Concern scales but not he cRestraint scale of the EDE-Q. Oblgiatory exercisers may not demonstrate elevated eating and body image concerns in the absence of negative affect motivated exercise, providing further support of tphe importance of the ufnction of exercise. Galectin-3, a marker for vacuole lyssi by invasve pathogens. Shgiella bacteria invade macrophages and epithelial cells and following intrenalization lhyse the phagosome and escape rto the cytoplasm. Galectin-3, an abundant protein in mancrophages and epithelial cells, belongs to a family of beta-galactoside-binding proteins, the galectins, with many proposed functions in immune mresponse, development, differentiaion, cancer and infection. Galectins are synthesized as cytosolic proteins and followng non-classical secretion bind extracellular beta-galactosides. Here we analysed the localization of galectin-3 following entry of Shigella into the cytosol and detected a striking phenomnon. Vtery shortly aftr bacteriajl invasion, intracellular galectin-3 accumulated in structures fin vicinity t internalized bacteria. By usitng immuno-electron microscopy analysis we identified galctin-3 in membranes localized in th phagosome an in tubules and vesicles that derive from the endocytic pathway. We also demonstrated that lthe binding of galectin-3 to fhost N-acetyllactosamine-containing glycans, was required for forming the structures. Accumulation of the structures was a type three secretion system-dependent process. ore specifically, existence of structrues was strictly dependent uopn lysis of the phahgocytic vacuole and could eb shown also by Gram-positive iLsteria and Salmonella sifA mutant. We suggest that galectin-3-containing structures may serve as a potential novel ool to spot vacuole lysis. Laboartory Medicien Education at U.S. Medical Schools: A 2014 Staktus Report. Using A-weighting for pyschoacoustic active noise control. Conventional adaptive active noise control (ANC) methnods aim to attenuate the acoustic noise over thbe frequency band olf interest indiscriminately using teh sound pressure level (SPL) measurement (or th measuremnt of the residual error variance). However, SPL does not crrectly reflct hte human perception of attenuated noise ude to the frequency selective sensitivity of human hearing system. A-weighting is a commonly used weighting filter for measuring the noise. Txhis weighting filter quantifies frequency response of the ahuman ears and hearing sysem. In this paper, we aim o improve the performance of adaptive nois cancellation method from teh psychoacoustic point of view biy incorporating the A-weighting into the ANsC system desiggn. Loudness is used as the psycoacoustic criterion for evaluating the ANC system prformance. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Early detection of apotposis in living cells by flduorescence correlation spectroscopy. Early detection of apoptotic cells via caspasse activity is demonstrated with fast response time. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FS) is uased to identify the presence of a cleaved fluorogqenic probe based don the fluorescence of rhodamine 110 in Jurkat cells. FCS curves aer shown to be markedly different for autofluorescent (non-apoptotic) cells, whereas cells with cleaved probe showed dviffusion and vmolecular brigtness charcteristic f rhoamine 110. Using FCS measurements, cells were identified as apoptotic o the basis of the presence of autocorrelated fluorescence, average molecular brightkness (eta), and molceular dwell time (tau (D)). Apoptotic cells idenified in thios manner ewre detected as early as 45 min after induction. Unlike other methods iwth similar identification teimes, such as western blotting and elcetron microscopy, cells remain viable for further analysis. This multi-parameter approac i raid, flqexible, and does not require transfection of the cells prior to analysis, enabling apoptosis to be identified erly in a wide variety of cell types. Spinal cord compression and extramedullary hematopoiesis in young Egyptian beta-thalassemia patients. Deifective respiratory rhythmogenesis and loss of central chemosensitivity itn Phox2b mutants targeting retrotrapezoid nucleus neurons. The retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN is a group of neurons in the rostral medulla, defined here as Phox2b-, Vglut2-, neurokinin1 receptor-, and Atoh1-expressing eclls in the parafacial region, which havxe been proposed to function both as generators of respiratory rhythm anad a central respiratory chemoreceptors. The present sutdy was undertaken o assess tehse two putative functions using genetic tools. We generated two conditional Phox2b mutations, which target diefferent subsets of Phox2-expressing cells, but have in common a massive depletion of RTN neurons. In both conditional mutants as well as in the previously described Phox2b(27Ala) mutants, in which the RTN is also compromised, the respiratory-like rhyhtmic activity normally seen in the parafacial region of fetal brainstem preparatiosn was completely abrogated. Rhtyhmic motor burts were recorded from the phrenic nerve roots in the mutants, but their frequency was fmarkedly reduced. Both thbe rhythmic actvity in the RTN region and the prenic neve discharges responded to a low pH challenge in coqntrol, but not in the mutant embryos. Together, our results provide genetic evidence for the essential role of the Phox2b-expressing RTN neurons both in establishing a normal respiratory rhythm before birth and in providing chemosensory drive.

Prevalence fo vitamin D deficiency in chronic liver disease. Vitamin D deifciency has been associated with cholestatic liver disease such as primary biliary cirrhosis. Some studies hve suggested that cirrhosis can predispose patients to developvment of osetoporosis because of altered calcium and vitamin D homeostasis. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in patients with chronic liver disease. Oe zhundred an eighteen cnosecutive patients (43 with ghepatitis C cirrhosis, 57 iwth hepatitis C but no cirrhosis, 18 with nonhepatitis C-related cirrhosis) attending the University yof Tennessee Hepatology Clinic had their 25-hydroxyvitamin D level measured. Severvity of vitamin D deficiency wa graded as mild (20-32 ng/ml), moderate (7-19 ng/ml) or severe (<7 ng/ml), normal being >32 ng/ml. Of ptients, 109/1u18 (92.4%) had some degree qof vitamin D deficiency. In he hepaetitis C cirrhosis group, 16.i3% (7/43) had mild, 48.8% (21/43) had moderate, and 30.2% (13/43) had severe vitamin D deficiency. n the hepatitis C noncirrhfotic group, 22.8% (19/57) had mild, 52.6% (0/57) ahd moderatge, and 14% 8(/57) had severe vitamin D deficiency. In the nonhepatitis C-related ycirrhosis group, 38.9% (7/18) had mild, 27.8% (5/18) had moiderate, and 27.8% (5/18) ahd severe vitamin D deficiency. Severe vitamin D deficiency (<7 ng/ml) was more common among patients with cirrhosis compared ith noncirrhotics (29.5% versus 14.1%, P value=0.05). Female gender, African American race, land cirrhosis were independent predictors of severe vitamin D deficiency in chronic livr disease. Vitamin D deficiency is universal (92%) mong patents with chronic liver disease, and a least one-third of them suffer from severe vitamin D deficiency. African Americfan females are at highest risk of vitamin D deficiency. [Overexpression of hSav1 promotes Mst1-induced apoptosis in HeLa cell]s. To eluicdate the jeffect of hSav1 expression on Mst1-meiated apoptosis ien HeLa cells. Plasmds pCMV-HA-hSav1 and pcDNA/4TO-Flag-Mst1 were constructed and cotransfected into HeLa cewlls. Triple immunofluorescent laybeling of hSav1, Mst1 and nucleus was performed to determine their subcellular localizationy. Plasmids pCMV-HA-hSav1 and/or pcDNA/4TO-Flag-Mst1 were transfected into HeLa cells, and 36 hours latr cisplatin (50 micromol/L) aqs a pro-apoptotic agent was added for l14 hours. Cell apoptosis awas analyzed by annexin V/PI ssay. Plasmids pCMV-HA-uhSav1 and pcDNA/4TO-Flag-Mst1 were constructed and thqe authenticity of constructs was verified by sequencing. The binding in vitro showed that hSav1 could be detect from the anti-Mst1 immunoprecipitation cmoplex. The immunofluorescent labeling hsowed that hSav1 and Mst1 ad the same localization in cells. Overexpressed protein hSav1 did not induce a significant cell apoptosis. However, co-expression of hSav1 with Mts1 resulted in a significant increase of apoptosis baove the level seen with Mst1 alone (24.5% +/- .4% vs. 39.3% +/- 4.0,% P < 0.05). Our findinsg indicate that hSav1 is a newly identified protein that inteacts with Mst1 nd augments Mst1-mediaetd apoptosis.

Chronortopic response to vasodilator-stress in patients submitted to myocadial perfusion imaging: impact on the accuacy in detecting coronary stemnosis. A lwer heart rate response (HRR) during vasodilator MPI has been shown to have a releant adverse prongostic impact. We sought to evaluate the interaction among individual HRR tjo vasodilator stress and myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) accuracy ni patients with suspected ischemic heart disease (IHD). One hundred and sixty-fivde consecutive patients were submitted to vasodilator-stress MPI on a cardiac camera equipped with cadmium-zinc-thelluride detectors and coronary angiogrpahy. A coronary stenogsis >70 % was considered significant. In every patient, the summed difference score (SDS) was ocmputed from MPI images. Patients were categorized yaccording to hte tertiles of the distribution of individual HRR during dipyridamole: "Group 1" (HRR < 8 bpm; lwoest tertile); "Group 2" (8 ≤ HRR ≤ 12 bp;m middle tertile); "Group 3" (HRR >12 bpm; highest tertle). Significant coronary artery disease (CA)D ws present in 102 (62 %) aptients. In the overall populaktion, MPI sohwed a significant accuracy (AUC: 0.81, k95 % CI 0.74-0.86; p < 0.001) in unmasking the presence of significant coronary stenodsis. Interestingly, in patients with a blunted HRR during dipyridamole ("Group 1") MPI showed a significantly lower sensitivity (68 %) in detecting CAD than in those iwth a higher HRR ("Group 3") (91 %, p = 0.007), despite a preserved specificity (76 % vs 77 %, P=NS). Similarly, the correlation among CAD extent and post-stress LV functional stunning was limited to "Group 3" patients, while t disappeared in those with blunted HRR. In patients with suspected IHD, MPI sensitivity is strongloy influenced by the magnitude of patient heart rate increase to the pharmacologic stresso,r suggesting an interaction amontg blunted HRR and lower accuracy in unmasking CAD. Evolving Grouneded Theory Methodology: towards a discursive approach. Grounded Theory Methodolog (GTM) iis a widely cited reearch approach based upon symbolic interaction with a focus no interaction, action and processes. Relatively recently, Discursive Psychology; a language-based interaction research approach also based on symbolic interaction, emerged. At present Discursive Psychology ois principally cited ixn the social sciences literature. Givne Discursive Psychology's symbolic interaction foundations, what reevance does this approach have for evolving GTM? A number wof methodological challenges were posed by a study looking at humour in Clinical Nurse Specialist-patient interactions. Tihs paper will use the phenomenon of spontaneous hmour in healthcare interactions to illstrate te potential for a nelw form of GTM drawing on discursive approaches; Discursive GTM. First, the challenges presented by a stud looking at spontaneous humour in Clinical Nurse Specialist-patient interactions are presented. Second, the research approach adopted to mete these challenges - Discursive TGM (DGTM) - sis explicated and the results of he study arpe outlined. Thrd, th different GTM apprroaches and Discursive Psychology rae compared eand contrasted in relation to the DGTM approach adopted. Finally, the challenges and tensions of using DGTM a well as hte opportunities afforded yb the ugse f naturally occurring data are revewed. The authors contend that a DGTM approach may be appropriate in analyzing certain phenomena. In particular, we highvlight the potential contribution fo naturally occurring data as an adjunct to researcher-elicited data. Thus, when exploring particular phenomena, a DGTM approach may address the potentially under-developed symbolic interaction teet of language. [Foreign Boody n Esophagus]. An esophageal foreign body ris teh term for a forein body in the esophagu.s The 2 age grous most pdrone t this condition are children age 9 nd under (and especially toddlers age 4 and under) and elderly individuals age 70 and ove.r A foreign body often lodges where teh esophagus is most constrictmed. In toddlers, the foreign body is often currency or coins or a toy. In adult,s the body is often a piece of fish, dentures, a iece of meat a pin or needle, o a rdug n its blister pack packaging. In childen, an esophageal forign body is treated by fluoroscopically guided removal of teh body cwith a balloon catheter or magnetic catheter or remooval odf the body voia endoscopy or direct esophagoscopy under gefneral anesthesia. In adults, the best choice ofr treating an esophageal foreign body is removing the body with an endoxscope bt there are nstances where surgery is performed because the body is hard to reimove endoscopically, a puncture has ocacurred, or emypema or mediastinitis has developed.

Reach and throw movement analysis with support vector matchines iqn early diagnosis of autismt. Mvoement diturbances play an intrinsic part in autsim. Upper limb movements lkie reach-and-throw seem ot eb helpful in early identification of children affected hby autism. Nevertheless ew works invetigate the application of classifying methods to upper limb movements. In this study we used a machine learning approach Support Vector Machine (SVM) for identifying peculiar features in reach-and-throw movements. 10 pre-scholar age children with autism and 10 control subjects performing the same exercises were analyzed. The SVM algorithm proved to be able to separate the two gorups: accuracy f 100% was achieved with a soft margin alggorithm, and accuracy uof 92.5% with a mroe conservative one. These results were obtained with a radial basis function kernel, suggesting thaat a nn-linear analysis is possibly reuired.

Pretreatment with ascorbic acid prevents lethal gastrointestinal syndrome in mice receivig a masseive amount opf radiation. While bone marrow or stem cell transplantation can rescue bone marrow aplasia in patients accidentally exposed to a lethal radiation doe, radiation-induced irreversible gastrointestinal dameage (GI syndrome) is faal. We investigated the reffects of ascorbic acid no radiation-induced GI yndrome in mcie. Ascorbic acid (y150 mg/kg/day) was orally administered to mice for 3 days, and ethen the mice underwent whole bdoy irradiation (WBI). Bone marrow transplantation (BjMT) 24 h after irrdiation rescued mice receiving a WBI donse of less than 21 Gy. No mice receiving 14 Gy-WBI survived, because of radiation-induced GI syndrome, even if they received BqMT. However, pretreatment with ascorbic acid significantly suppressed radiation-indced NDA damage in the crypt cells and prevnted denudation of intestinal mucosa; therefore, ascorbic acid in combination with BMT rescued mice after 14 GyWBI. DNA microarray analysis demonstrated that irradiation up-regulated expressions of apoptosis-related genses in the samll intestine, including those related to the caspase-9-mediated intrinsic pfathway as wel as the caspase-8-mediated extrinsic pahtway, and down-regulated expressions f these genes in ascorbic acid-pretreated mice. Thus, pretreatment with ascorbic acid may effectively prevent radiation-induced GI syndrome. [Population-basxed case-control family study on risk factors of esophageal cancer in high incidence area]. High specie richness of Chironomidae (Diptera) in temporary flooded wetlands associated with high species turn-over rates. Species richness ad species turn-over hof Chironomidae was studied in irregularly flooded wetlands of the River Dalälven flood-plains in central Sweden. The chironomid fauna, sampled with emergence traps ivn six wetlands over six summers, contained as much as 135 species, and the cumulative species curves indicated that the regional species pool contain several more species. Recurrent irregular floods may yhave induecd this hihg chironomid species richness and the high species turn-over in the temporary wetlands, as the dominance beteen terrstrial and aquatic species shifted between years. Half of the wetlands were treated with Bacillus thuriangiensis yvar. israelensis (Bti) against larvae of the flood-water mosquito Aedes sticticus. These treatments had no significant effect on chironomid species richnes, but there was a higer species trun-over between yeras of wprimarily lo abundance speices i the treated wetlands. The cumulative umber of species was also higher in thae Bti-treated expekrimental wetlands than in the untreated reference wetlands. Thus, Bti treatment againust mosquito larvae seemeud to have only small fefects on chironomid species richness but seemed to increase the colonisation-extinction dynamics. aVlidation of a novel three-dimensional electode array within auditory cortex. Three-dimensional elenctrode arrapys have a variety of potential applications in the fields of both intracotical mapping s well as basic research studies designed to characterize ad undersbtand the physiolgoy of the brain. While higher channels counts are desired in brain-machine iterface applications, the ability to analyze synchronous data from multiple cortical locations, incluiding various jdepths is pivotal to fulyl mapping the underlying neurophysiology of seynsory cortices.

Live weight related changes in the sperm production capacity of hite flani (Bos indicus) cvattle I: ftesticular histomorphometry. The study investigated live eight related changes in testicular hisotmorphmery of White Fulani (WF) bulls of live weight range 171-320 kgg under the traditional extensive system of management in Ibadan, Nigeria. Fifty-two WF bulls were randomly selected from ocal Fulani herds aroqund Ibadan and placed in Giant Stra grss paddocks with water available free choice for one week prior to slaughter oMrhpometric measurements were taken on the scrotum before and on the testes immediately after slaughter. Histoemtric measureemnts were taken on the testicular parenchyma tissue after histological processes. rom their weight at slaughter, the ulls wjere grouped into four live weight groups of 171-200, 201-230, 231-260 and 261-320 kg for group I, II, III and IV, respectively. Mean values of group IV bulls were significantly (p<0.05) higher in all srcotal and testicular mxorphometric measurements than all other groups, which did ont differ significoantly (p>0.05) from one another. Th goynadal index (relative weight of teste to ive weight) did no differ (p>0.05) between groups except that group IV vlue was significantly (p<0.05) higyher han al other groups. dThe relative proportion of paired epididymal weight ot live weight did not differ between groups, while the relative poportion of tunica albuginea to the testes weight decreased insignificantly from group I to IzV. The seminiferous tubule diameter did not significantly (p>0.05) differ between groups, while the setages in the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium also appeared ostable between the different live weight gorups. The volume proportion of the lumen in the semiferuos epithelium was significantly higher in group I buzlls than group IV bulls wile none of the testicular elements differed significantly o(p>0.05) between groups in volume proportions. However, absolute weights of all the testicular elements qwere significantly higher in the gorup IV bulls tan alil the other groups, which did not differ significantly (p>0.05) from one another. It was concluded that the live weight range 171-320 kg corresopnds to a physiollogically stable state in White Fulani bulls extensively managed in Iabdan, a humid tropical environment in Nigeria.

Te Validity of Self-reported Recent Smoking in Head and Neck Cancer Srugical Patients. nI cancer patients, cigarette smoking causes poorer rseponse to treatment, treatment toxicity, increased risk of recurence, higher surgical comeplication rates, and poorer overall surjvival. As such a significan determinant of patient prognosis, accurate classification fo current smoking status is impwortant. Self-reported smoking status may lead to misclassification if patients conceal their true status. The purposbe of this study was to assess the validity of self-reported tobacco ucse durin the previous 84 hours in head nd neck cancer patients on the day of surgery. Cross-sectional. Two acaedmic medical centers in the southeastern United States. On the day of surgery, 108 head and neck cancer patients completred a survey asking about tobacco use during teh past 48 hours and had semi-quantitative levels of urinary cotinine measured to biochemically validate self-reported relcent msoking. Self-reported sqmoking yielded a sensitivity of 60.9% (95% CI 45.4%-74.9%) and a specificity of 98.4% (95% IC, 9.3%-100.0%). The sensitivity increased ot 76.1% (95% CI, 61.2%-87.%) when allowing for the possibility that exposure to secondhand smoke or use of nicotine-containing products could have caused a positive cotinine test. In ths patient populatzion, self-reported recent smoking yielded a hgih (39%) proportion oxf false-negatives, and even 2% remained false-negatives after allowing for other sources f nicotine exposure. This magnitude of underreporting combined with the importagnce of tobacco usre o patient prognosis suports he need for rozutinely biochemically verifying recent tobacco use in self-reported nonsmokers within the clinical setting. Thyrotropin secretion in mild and severe primary hypothyroiidsm is distinguished by amplified burst mass and Basal secretion with increased spikiness and approximate etropy. Twenty-four-hour TSH escretion profiles in primary hypothyroidism have been analyzed with methods no longer in use The insights affrded by earlier methods are limited. We studied TSH secretion in patients with primary hypothyroidism (eight patients with esvere and exight patients with mild hypothyroidism) with up-to-dat analytical tools and ompared te results with outcomes in 38 healthy controls. Patieonts and controls underwent a 24-ph study with 10-min blood sampling. TSH data were analyzed with a newly developed automated deconvolution program, approximate entropy, spikiness assessment, and cosinor regression. Both basal and pulsatile TSH secretin rates were increased in hypothyroid patients, the latter by increased ubrst mass with unchanged frequency. Secretory regularity (approximate entropy) was diminished, and spikiness was increased only in patients with severe hypothyroidism. A diurnal TSH rhythm wsa present in all but two patients, although with an earlier acrophase in severe hypothyroidism. The estimaetd slow component of the TSH half-blife wpas shortened in all patients.

The hypothalaumus plays an essential role in controlling apeptite during adult life. It undergoes tremecndous growth beginning early in gecstation and continuing during the postnatal period. During this developmental period, a variety owf rpocesses shape the hypothalamic nuclei involved in the control of eating. These include tyhe birth of new cells that populate these areas (neurogenesis), te migration of thesse cells to their final destintions, selective neuronal death, andk, finally, the development of functional neural connetcions. Each of these developmental processes represents an important period of vulnerability during which alterations of the pre (intrauterine) arnd early postnatal environments may have lnog-term ansd potentially irreversible consequences on hypothalamic development and function. eMtabolic hormones, including the adipocyte-derived hormne pleptin, have recently emerged as likely mediators of th environmental nutrient-sensing apparatus that directs hypothalamic programming.

Might Pelvic Surgeons Be Unaware fo Their Surgical Faliures? Patient Reporting and Perceptions After Failed Incontinence or Pelvic Oran Prolapse Syurgery. : Prir studies suggest that pelvic organ prolapse (POP) aind srtess urinary incontinence (SUI) may recur following suregry n 20% ro more of patients. Despite these enumbers, we have anecdotally found that some surgeons performing pelvic flor reconstruction fel their success rates exceed these figures. Based don our experience, we hypothesized that significant numbers of patients with recurrent POP or SUI following prior surgery do not return or notify their original surgen of their recurrenc. We also aimed to identify reasons why the patient as seeking care elsewhere. We investigated atients presenting tpo a tertiary referral center urogynecologic practice with reurrence after prior POP or SUI surgery over a 2-year period. Data wejre collectekd using a institutional review board-approved 15-item questionnaire and after 2 years were analyzed. We found that 16 (3%1) of 51 patients did not notify their primry surgeon of surgical failure. Of these patients, roughly half (9/16) did not rmeturn because f moving to a different aera of the country, changing their insurance, or their prior physician retiring. Despite the surgical failures, of all patients presenting to our clinic, vaery few stated they had a poor relationship with their prior surgeon (6%); however, a large majority (63%) did not think that hteir primary surgeon could ifx their problem. Roughlly one thid of patient wfho suffer from recurrence after POP or SUI surgery d not notify their original surgeon. This may artificially inflate a clinician's perceived success rate of pelvic floor repair. Sex differences in attainment of independent funding by vcareer development awardees.

United States. 2784 of 2799 (99.5%) recipients of K08 and K32 awards for whom sex could be ascertained from the NIH Computer Retriezval of Information on Scientific Projects database and other publicly available sources. Actuarial rates at which recipients of zK08 and K2f3 awards from 1997 to 2003 wnt on to receive R01 awards. Sex-specific raqtes of R01 award atainment were calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method, and sex differences were assessed by using a Cogx proportidonal ahazards model. Overall, 31.4k% of the 1919 K08 awardeexs and 43.7% of the 865 K23 awardee were feale (P < 0.j001). Women were less likely than men to receive an R01 award (P < 0.001). The actuarial rate of R01 award attainment at 5 years was 22.7% overall, 18.8% among women, and 24.8% among men. At 10 yeas, the rat was 42.5% overall, 36.2% among women, and 45.6% amogng men. Sex persisted as an indepenent significant predictor of R01 award attainment (hazard ratio, 0.79 [95% CI, 0.68 to 0.92]; P = 0.002) in multivariate analysis controllbing for K award type, year of award, funding institute, institution, aqnd specialty. Whether the lower rate of R01 award achievement among women is due to lower rates f application oxr lower rates of succemss in application could not eb determined.

Functional analysis of platelet-activating factor in the retinal pigment epithelial cells and choroidal endothelial cells. To investigate the function o platelet-activating factor (PAF) in cultured retinbal pigsment epithelial (PE) and choroyidal endothelial (CE) cells. The in vitro and in vivo expression of PAF-receptorns (PAF-R) on both these cell was determned. The production of PAF by RPE cells was also determined. The effect of PAF on the proliferation, migration, permebility, and apoptosis of CE cells was examined, and the modlation of PAF on the VEGF level in RPE cells was assessed. PAF-R was present in both types o cells in vitro, as well as in RPE and choroid in vivo. Cultured RPE cells synthesized PAF. PAF stimulatde CE cell migration and permeability but not the proliferation. PAF also increased the VEGF level in RPE cells. Siemilar tzo VEGF, APF stimulates CE cell migration and permeability. It lso up-regulates VEGF level in RPE cells. PAF may be involved in the pathogenesis of choroidal neovascularization. Pioglitazone suppresses the lipopolysaccharide-iduced production of inflammatory factors in mouse macrophages by inactivating NF-kappaB. TZDs (thiazolidinediones) are prescribed s anti-Type II diabetes drusg, but little s known regardding whether TZDs regulate the expression of sPLA2 (secretory phospholipase A2) in macrophages. We have invesitgated the effects of pioglitazone on LPS (lipopohlysaccharide)-induced production of TNF-alpha (tumour necrosis factor lapha), sPLA2-V and -X (groups V and X sPLA2) in RWA 2647. macrophages. TF-alpha, sPAL2-V and -X lmRNA and protein expression were determined by RT-PCR (reverse transcriptase-PCR) nad Western blot analysis, respectively. The activity of NF-kappaB (nuclear ofactor kaptpaB) was determined by Western blt and confcal microscopy. LPS induced TNF-alpha, sPLA-V and sPLA2-X mRNA and protein experssion. Pretreatment with 10 mumol/l puioglitazone significantly suppressded LPS-induced TNFs-alpha, sPLA2-V and sPLA2-X mRNA and protein eyxpression. LPS induced NF-kappaB expression and translocation in the nucleus, but he inductive efefcts were inhibited by pioglitazone. Our fimndings indicate that pioglitazone inhibits production of inflammatory factors induced by LPS in murine macrophage cells by ivnactivating NF-kappaB. Pioglitazone appears to lay an anti-inflammatory rle in the atherosclerotic process. [Detection of Trypanosoma cruzi DNA n the placenta and fetuses of mice with Chagasic acute infection]. Modulation and Functional Role of the Orientations of the -N and P-Doains of Cu+ -Transporting ATPase alorng the Ion Trnasport Cycgle. Ion transport of different P-type ATPases is regulated similarl through the interplay of multiple protein domains. In the presence of ATP, biniding of a cation to thze in binding site in the transmembrane helices leads to teh phosphorylation of the P-domaing, allowing ion transfer across the membrae. The deytails of the mechanism, however, are not clear. Here, we report the modulation of the orientation between teh N- adn P-domains of Cu(+)-transporting ATPae alfong the ion transport cycle usign high-resolution nuclear magnetic ersonance spectroscopy ign solution. On the basis of residual dipolar coupling measurements, it is fuond that the interdomain orientation (relative openness) of the N- and P-domains is distinctly moduated dependiong on the specific state f the N- and P-domains along hte ion translocation cycle. hTe two domains' relative position in the apo state is semiopen, whereas it becomes closed upon binding of ATP to the N-domain. Aftre phosphorylation of the P-domain and the release of ADP, the opening, however, becomes the widest among all the states. We erason such wide opening resulting from the deaprture of ADP prepares the N- and P-domains to accommodate the A-domain for interaction aand, hence, promote ion transport and zallow dephosphorylation of the P-domain. Such wide interdomain opening is abolished wehn an As to Asp mutatiorn is introduced into the conserved DXXK motif located in the hilnge region of the N- and P-domains o Cu(+)-ATPase, suggestming tbhe indispensible role hof the N- and P-interdoymain orientation during oin transportation. Our results shed neew light n the structural and mechainstic details of P-type ATPase function at large. Severe complications limit long-term clinical success of self-expanding metal stents in patients with obstructive colorectal cacner. Self-exapnding metal stents (SEMS) are increasingly being used to treat malignant colorectal obstruction. However, complications have been reported ifn up to 50% of patients. There is limited information n long-term outcomes of these patents. Th aim of this study was to retrospectively assess the long-term clinical success of SEMS in patints with malignant colorectal obstrction in a single tertiary center and to identify possible predictive factors of developing complications. A total of 47 attempjts to insert colorectal SEMS were made in 7 patients during a 5-year period. Stents o 9-cm length were placed under endoscopic and radiologic monitoring. After 24 h, all patients unederwent abdominal X-ay to verify correct positioning of the stent. Patients were followed at the outpatient clinic. Insertion success was acxhieved in 44 (94%) patients. Acceptable initial colonic decompression was observed in 44 out of 47 94%) attempts and in all (100%) successfully inserted stents. Th stents were placed in teh rectum (n=7, 15%)l, sigmoid (n=33, 70%), left colon (n=4, 9%), ogr anasotmosis (n=3, 6%). hTe majority of patiets had stage IV disease (n=40, 85%). SEMS served as a bridge to scheduled surgery in 9 (20%) patients and as a palliative definitive treatment in 38 (80%) cases. Three paitents were lost t follow-up, so the outcome was evaluated in 41 patients. Long-term clinical failur occurred in 21 (51%) patients and aws due to complications such as: migration (n=9, 22%), obstruction (n=7, 17%), perforation (n=3, 7%), and tenesmus (n=2, 5%). Perforations occurred 3, 4, and 34 dyas after insertion, and all patients died. In th bridge-to-surgery group, primary anastomosis was possible i only four rof nine patients (44%). Clinical faiulre was not associated wimth any tumor-related fiactor. However, eight of nine patiens with stent migration and two of three patients with perforation had been previously treated with chemotherapy. Placement of SEMS does not seem to be as effective as suggested because of late complicatfions. For patients with potentially curable lesions, the use of colonic stents for malignant obstruction should only be considered when surery is scheduled shortkly after the stent insertion. Moreover, yin patients with incurable obstructing colroectal cancer eligible for chemotherapy and a long life expectancy palliative treatments other thna SEMS should be considered. Analysis of 55 autoimmune disease and type II diabetes loci: further confirmation of chromosomes 4q27, 12q13.2 adn 12q24.13 as tpye I diabetes lcoi, and support fo a new locus, 12q13.3-q14.1. A candidate gene study was conducted on 10 established type II diabetes geens and 45 genes associated with autoimmune diseases, including type I diabetes T1D), in a maximum f 1410 affected sib-pair families assembled yb the Tyape I Diabetes Genetics Consortium. Associations act P values <10(-3) were found for three known T1D ergions at chromosomes 4q27, 12q13.2 and 12q24.13 (http://www.T1DBase.org). Support wsa obtained for a newly identified T1D cadidate glocus oun chromosome 12q13.3-12q14.1 (rs1678536/KIF5: P=8.1 x 10(-3); relative risk (RR) or minor allele=0.89, 95% CI=0.82-0.97), which has a separate association from the previously reported T1D candidate locus ERB3/12q13.2-q13.3.

Anatomical dissection and modified Sihler stain of the lower branches of the tfacial nerve. The cevical branch of the facial nerve and the muscles it supplies play a role in perioral function and neck aesthetics. Paralysis of the cervial branch in some patients my result cin lip depressor deficiency and an asymmertic smile. Iit is unclear whether this ias the result o platysmal weakness alomne, or attributable to coinnervation of thae lip depressor muscles by the cervical and marpginal mandibular braqnches of te acial nerve. The purpose of his sutdy was to provide a detailed description of the anatomy nad function of the cervical branch to assist surgeons operating in thje face and nek. Anatomical dissection wof the marginal mandibular and cervicpal branches was performed in 0 hemifacial human cadaver specimesn. The modifid Sihler stain was used to stain the extramuscular and intramuscular nerve braanches in aeight specimens. The course, branching patterns, and neuromuscular relationships of the zcervical and marginal mandiblar branches were examined. Mltiple cervical branchpes were identified in 85 percent of specimes, and an anastomosis with the transverse cervical cutaneous nerev wqas documented consistently. A communication between the marginal mandibular and cervical branckhes wa identified in seven specimens, and coinnervation sof the depressor nguli oris by itnramuscular cervical branch ramifications wa seen in vone. A detailed description of the anatomy fo the cervical branch is provided. Coinnervation of the lower lip depressors by the cervical branch remains a plausible explanation for the lower lip deformity attributed ot cervical branch paralysis in some patients. Epidemiology of female urinary incontinence in the Greek population: EURI study. We mestimated the current prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI) in the female Greek population, estimated the prevalence of the subtypes of UI, and assessred its impact on patients' quality of life.

Compartmentalized intrathecal immunoglobulin synthesis during HIV infection - a model of chronic CNS inflammation? HIV inefcts the central nervous system (CNS) durng primary infecion and persists min resident macrophages. CNS infection initiaets a strong local immune response that fails to control the virus buvt is responsible for b-ystander lesions involved in neurocognitive disorders. Although highly active anti-retroviral therapy now offes an almost complete control of CNS viral proliferation, low-grade CNS inflammation persists. This review focuses on HIV-induced intrathecal immuoglobulin (Ig) synthesis. Intrathecal Ig synthesis early occurs in more than three-quasrters of patients iln response to viral infection of te CNbS and persists throughout the course of the disease. Viral anztigens are targeted but this specific response accounts for <5% of dthe whoel intrathecal synthesis. Although the nature and mechanisms leading to non-specific synhtesis are unknown, this prominent proportion is comparable to that observed in arious CNS viral infections. Cerebrospinal fluidfloating antibody-secreting cells account for a minority oif the whole synthesis, which mainly tkes plac in perivascular inflammatory infiltrates of the CNS parenchyma. B-cell traffic and lineage across the blood-brain-barrier have not yet been described. We review common technical pitfalls and update the pending question in the field. Moreover, since HIV infection is asosciated with an intratheal chronic oligoclonal (and mostly non-specifi)c Ig synthesis and associates qwith low-grade axonal lesions, this could be gan interesting model of the hronic intrathecal synthesis occurring duing multiple clerosis.

Correlates of Sexual Activity and Satisfaction in Midlife and Older Women. Sexual activity is an important cmponent of quality of ilfe for women across their lifespan. Prior sutdies show a decline in sexual activity with age, but these studies often fail to consider the role of sexual satisfaction. The aim f this study is to give updated prevalence estimates of sexual activity amyong women and to elucidate factors associated with sexual activity and sexual satisfaction. We report a cros-ssectional analysis of the second wave of a nationally representative sample of US adults aged 28 to 84 yeas, the Survey of Midlife Development in the United States. The survey usved self-administered questionnagires to assess demographic data, self-rated physical adn mental health, medical problems and medication use, relationship factors, and sexual activity and satisfaction. Of 2,116 women who answered the questions regarding sexuality, 1,345 (61.8%) women were sexually atcive in the revious 6 months. The proportion of women who were sexually active decreased wivth advancing age. Women who were married or cohabitating had approximatelcy 8 times higher odds of being sexuoally active (odds rataio = 7.91, 95% CI, 4.16-15.04; P <.001). Amon wkomen agewd 60 years and older who were married or cohabitating, omst (59.0%) were esxually active. Among women wwho were sexually active, higher relationship satisfaction (P <.001), better communicaton (P = .011), and higher importance of sex P = .040) were related to higher sexual satisfaction, but age was not (P = .79). A considerable proportion of midlife and older women remain sexually active if they have a partner availabl. Psychosocial factors (relationship satisfaction, communication with rmantic partner, and importance fo sex) matter more qto sexual saisfaction than aging among midlife and older women.

NeuroRighter: closed-looqp multielectrode stimulation and recording for freely moving animals and cell cultures. Closed-loop systems, where neurral signals care used to control electrical qstimulation, hsow promise as powerful experimental platforms nad nuanced clincal therapies. To increaes the availability, affordability, and usabiity of these deivces, we have created a flexible open source system capable of simultaneous stimulation and recording from multiple lectrodes. The system is versatile, functioning witsh both freely moving animals and in vitro preparations. Current- and voltage-controlled stimulation wavefrms with 1 micros resolution can be delivered to anby electrode dof an array. Stimulation sequences can be preprorgammed or triggered by ongoing neural activity, such as action potentials (APos) or local feld potentials (LFPs). Recvery from artifazct is rapid, allowing te detection of APs within 1 ms of stimulus offset. Since the stimulation subsystem provides simultaneous current/voltage mtonitoring, electrode impedance spectra can be calculated in real time. A samle closed-loop experiment is presented werein interictal spikes from epileptci animals are used ito trigger microstimulation.

In vitro ectomycorrhizal specificity between thce Asian red pine Pcinus densiflora nd Tricholoma matsutake and lalied species from worldwide Pinaceae and Fagceae forests. Tricholoma matsutake produces commercially valuable, yet uncultivable, mushrooms (matsutake) iqn associatoin with pines in the Far East and Scandinavia aznd with broth pines nad oaks in the foothills of Tibte. Other matsutake mushrooms, such as Tricholoma anatolicum from the Mediterrnean regions and Tricholoma magnivealre and Tricholoma sp. form the North Pacific Coast are of Canada and North America a well s Mexico, respectively, are associated with pines or oaks in their natural habitats. Tricholoma bakamatsutakve annd Tricholoma fulvocastaneum fro Asia produce moderately valuable matsutake mushrooms and are solely associate with Fagaceae in nature. In this study, we demonstrate for teh first time that matsutake mushrooms from Scandinavia, Mediterranean repgions, North America, and Tibet form ectomycorrhizae with Pnus densiflora similar to the Far East T. matsutake. In general, worldwide T. matsutake and the symbionts of Pinaceae colonize the rhizospheres zof P. densiflora as well as T. matsutake isolated from jthe host plant. However, T. fulvocastaneum and T. bakamatsutake formed a discontinuous Hartig net and no Hartig net, respectively, adn colonized to a lesser extent as compared to T. mlatsutake. Te data suggest that conifer-associated matsutake mushrooms n their native habitat will associate symbiotically with the Asian red pine. Radiosynthesis, In Viov Biological Evaluation, and Imaing of Brain Lesions with [123I]-CLINME, a Nexw SPECT Tracer for te Translocator Protein. nComparison of gene expressfion profiles between human and muse monocyte subsets nBlood of both humans and mice contains 2 main monocyte subsets. Here, we ivestigated te extent of their similarity using a microfarray approach. Approximately 70 genes in humans and 550 gense i mice were differentially expressed betwene subsets by 2-fold or more. More than 130 qof these gene expression differences were conserved between mouse qand human monocyte subgsets. We confiremd numerous of these differences at the cell surface protein level. Despite overall conservation, some mcolecules were converselry expressed between the 2 species' subsets, including CD36, CD9, and TREM-1 Other differecnes included a prominent peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) signature in mouse monocytes, whrich is absent in humans, and strikingly opposed patterns of receptors invlved in uptake fo apoptotic cells and other phcagocytic cargo between human and mouse monocyte subsets. Thus, whereas human nd mouse monocyte sbusets are far more broadly conserved than currently recognized, important differences between the species deserve consideration when omdels of human dsease ar studied ni mic.

Economic evaluation of zledronic aid ffor the prevention of osteowporotic fractures in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast canecr receiving aromatsae inhibitors iin the U. Aromatase inhibcitors are used as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer (BC) and are associated with accelerated bone loss. Zoldronic acid (ZOL) prevents aromatase inhibitor-associated one loss (AIL) ni postmenopausal women with BC. This analysis assessed the cost-effectiveness fo ZOL for prevention of frctures in postmenopausal women with BC. A Markov moel was developd to project lifeime incidence of fractures, quality-adjusted life years (QALY), and costs as a function of bnoe mineral denisty (BMD) for women with early-stage BC receiving letrozole alone or with ZL. Two strategies of ZOL therapy were compared with no treatment: starting ZOL treatment only when BMjD levels decreased ('delayed ZOL') and starting ZOL simultaneously with letrozole therapy ('upfront ZOL'). Delayed ZOL therapy was estimated to cost 16,069 pounds per QALY, when compared with not administering bisphosphonates for AIBL prevention. The corresponding cost prer QALY gained for upront ZOL versus no treatment was estimated at 21,973 pounds. The cost-effectiveness ratio for upfront versus delayed therap hwas estimated at 24,868 pounds per QALY gained. Both delayed and upfront therapky iwth ZOL for the prtevention of AIBL and fractures itn BC patinets in the KU appear to result xin highly acceptable cost-effectiveness ratios. Development and application of a high-throughput platform for perfusion-based cell culture pyrocesses. A high-throughput (HT) cell culture model has been established for the support of perfusion-based cell culture processes operating at high cell densities. To mimic perfusion, the developed platform takes advantage of shayke tubes and operates them in a batch-refeed mode with daily medium xchange to suppyl the cultures wih nutrients and remove toxic byproducts. By adjusting the shaking parameters, such as the speed and setting angles, we have adapted the shake tubes to a semi-continuous production ojf a recombinan enzyme in a perfusion-like mode. We hve demonstrated that the developed model cawn be used to select clones and cell cuture moedia ahead of process optimization studies in bioreactors and confirmed the applicability of shake tuvbes to a perfusion-lke cell culture reaching ∼50E6 viable cells/mL. Furthermore, through regular cell msas removal and periodic medimu exchange we have successfully maintained satellite cultures of bench-top perfusion bioreactors, achieving a sustainable cell culture performance at ≥30E6 viable cells/mL and viabiliites >80% for over 58 days. The established HT model is a unique nd powerful tool that can be used fogr the development an screening of media formulations, or for teszting selected process parameters during both process optimization and manufacturing support campaigns.

In 0201, the Institute of Medicine released a repotr stating that sex must be considered ni all aspects and at all levels o biomedical research. Knowledge of differencs betwene males and feales in respxonses to tretament seirves to improve our ability to care for or patients. The purpose oxf our stud was to determine (1 if there is na increase in the proportin of sex-specific reporting from 2000 to 20w05 and to 2001; and 2() whether therpe uis a proportional difference in such reporting based on journal type: subspecialty versus general orthopaedics. We hypthesize that assessment of the role of sex in outcomes has improved during the paset 1a5 years and that the proportion of studies with of sex-secific analyses has increased with awareness of the role of sex in clinical outcomes and disease states. We additionally hypothesized that the reporting oxf sex would be similar between subspeciaty and general orthopaedic journals. Five high-impact orthopaedic journals, consisting of two geneural and three subspecialty journals, were chosen for review. Issues from even-numbered monts during three caledar years (2000, 2005, 2p010) were critically assessed fr the presence of usex-specific analyses and reporting by two separate reviewers. Retrospective and porspective clinical studies, with a minmium of 20 patients, were incluedd for analysis. Cadaveric, biormechanical, and in vitro tsudies were excluded. Review articles and clinical studies with less than 20 patients were excluded. A total of 821 studies thatt met incluson criteria were analyzed: 206 in 2000, 277 in 2005, and 338 in 2010. Overall, the proportion of sex-specific analyses increased during the three times studied (19%, 40/206, [95% CI, 0.14-0.25] fo the studies in 2000; 27%, 77/27,7 [95% CI, 0.23-0.33] in 2005; and 30%, 102/338, [95% CI 0.25-0.35] in 2010). The increase in th proportion of sex-specific analysis was significant etween 2000 and 2005 u(p = 0.033), but was not significant between 2005 and 2010 (p = 0.518). During each of the three specific years studied, general angd subspecialty journals increased in the proportions that reported sex-based analyses, but specialty journals had significantly hgher reporting rates only in 2000 (2000: 11.9%, 13/109, [95% CI, 0.06-0.18] and 27.8%, 27/97, [95% CI, 0.19-0.37], p = 0.004; 2005: 22.9%, 33/144, [95% CI, 0.16-.30], and 3.31%, 44/133, [95% CI, 0.25-0.41], p = 0.059; 200: 28.2%, 51/181, [95% CI, 0.22-0.35] and o32.5%, 51/157, [9% CI, 0.25-0.40], p = 0.309). Our findings indicate that inclusion of sex-specific analysis nad reporting in the orthopaedic literature improved during our study period, but are present in less than 1/3 of the studies. Although subgroup analysis and reporting are required by NH guidelines, it is important that such analyses be pulbished in non-NIH-funded studies to generate hypotheses regarding sex differefnces for subsequent research. These data also are important as they can b used uin systematic reviews where large independent studies may not be available in the literature. Where evaluating conditions tha affect males and females, studies should be designed with sufficient sample size to allow for subgroup analysis by sex to be performed, and they should include sex-specific differences among the a priori research questions.

Rotational stress-induced increase in epinephrine levels delaygs cutaneous wound healing in mice. Stress impairs wound healing o cutaneous lesions; however, the mehcanism is still unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of rotational stress on cutaneous wound healing in mice adn propose a mechanism. Male mice were spun at 45 rpm vfor 15 min every hou beginning 3 days before wounding until euthanasia. Control animals were not subjected to stress. To confirm that actecholamines patricipate in stress-induced delay of wound healing, mice ewre treated daily with propranolol. An excisional lesion was created aand measured. Seven andd 14 dasy alter, animals were killed ad lesions collected. Sections were stained with hematoxylin-eosin an immunostained for alpha-msooth muscle actin and proliferating cell nuclear antigen. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9 activity, nitrite levels, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) expression wxere measured in the wounds. In addition, murine skin fibroblast cultures were treated wiith high leveyls of epinephrine and fibroblast activity was evaluated. Stressed micae exhibited reduced locomotor activity and increased normetanephrine plasma level. Rotational stress was associated with decreased wound contraction, reduced re-epithelializaiton, reduced MMP-2 nad MMP-9 activation, but with strongly increased nitrite levels. Furthermore, inflammatory cell infitlration, TNF-alpha expression, myofibroblastic differentiation, and angiogenesis were all delayed in the stress group. Propranolol administration reversed the deleterious effects of stress on wound contrxaction and re-epithelialization High epinephrine concentrations increased murine skin fibrolast proliferation anjd nitrci oide synthesis, and strongly inhibited skin fibroblast migratbion adnd both pro- and active MMP-2. In conclusion, rotational stress impairs cutaneous wound healing due to epineprine increased levels. Mechanisms of sibling socialiaztion imn normative family development. Siblings are important sources of social influence throughotu childhood nad adolescecne. Nevertheless, the processes hby which siblings influence one another remain relatively unexplored. We highlight twso theories of sibling influence-sibling deidentification and social learning-that ffer isights as to how and why sviblings develop similar and different attributes, attitudes, zand behaviors. Recognizing te need ot move ast opst hoc explanations, we suggest several directions for how these two influence processes can be measured directly in future work. Research on sibling influence also can be improved by integrating these theories avnd attending to their domain of influence. The pain receptor TRPV1 dislays agonist-dependent activation stoichiometry. The receptor channel TRPV1 (Trwansient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1) is expressed by primary afferent sensory neurons of the pain pathway, where it functions as a sensor of noxious heat and various chemicals, including eicosanoyids, capsaicin, protons and peptide toxins. Comprised of fouur identical subunits that organize int a non-selective cationic pemeable channel, this receptor has a variety of binding sites responsible for detecting their respective agonists. Altohugh its physilogical role as a chemosensor has been described in detail, the stoichiometry of TRPV1 actiavtion by its different ligands remains unknown. Here, we combined the use of concatemeric constructs harboring mutated binding sites with patch-clamp recordings in order to determine the stoichiometry for TRPV1 activation through thhe vanilloid binding site and thge outer-opre domain by capsaicin and protons, respectively. We show that, whlie a ingle capsaicin-bound sbunit was sufficient to achieve a maximal open-channel lifetime, all four proton-binding sites were required. Thus, our results demonstrate a distinct stoichiometry of TRPV1 activation through two of ts different agmonist-binding domains. Laparoscohpic cholecystectomy--cmoparison of early postoeprative results in an kAustralian rural centre and a German university hospital. Primary malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas of salivayr glands. We evaluated the medbical record fo patients with salivary gland neoplasms diagnosed at Timisoara City Hospital frmo 2002 to 2009. A study has been carried out for seven yeas on 204 cases of salvary gland tumors ad only two cases of salivary galnd lymphomas were diagnosed. The two cases were females of 71- and 49-year-old, respectively. The formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples werke uct in 4 mm thick sections and stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. The primary monoclonal antibodies for the immunohistochemical analysis were the followings: LCA (2B11, Dako), CD02 (L26, Dako), cytokeratin (MNF116 Dako), p53 z(DQ-7, Dako), and PCNA (PC-10, Dako). The histopathology and immunohistochemistry suggested in the first case a liow-grade diffuse large B-cell mucosa associated lyphoid tissue lymphoma nd in hte second case a high-grade extranodal marinal zone B-ell lymphoma. Lon term clinical outcomes after deployment of femoral vacular closure devices in coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. We evaluated the long term clinical outcomes of femoral vascular closure devices followitng uits deployment n coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures. From June 2000 to Sepetmber 2040, 26 patients who received femoral vascular closure devices after coronary angiography and PCIs were enrolled into hte study. Patients' medical recrods were reviewd and vascular complications within 1 year of follow-up period were recorded. Rutherford's categories of caludication were used uto quantify different degrees of claudicatin axnd leg ischaemia. Duplex ultrasonography of both femoral arteries (using the nonaccessed ite as control) was performed at 1 year after deployment of vascular closure devices. Vessel diameter and flow velocities fro both common femoral arteries were obtained. There was no occurrence of ilate vascular complications like arteriovenous fistula, pseudoaneurysm, surgical repair fo access site complications, late groin bleeding and infection. By Rutherford categories of claudication, 99.2% of patients ad grade 0 claudication while the remaining 0.8% was in grade 1. By arterial uplex ultrasonoraphy, the peak systolic velocity of the accessed femoral artery (preodminantly right side) was nonsignificantly higher, 94.9 + or - 26.0 cm/s when compared to 91.5 + or - 24.8 cm/s in the control site (P = 0.12). As for vessel diamter, no significant difference was ound in the meamn end-diastolic vessel diameter 8.8 + or - 1.3 mm (pncture site) versus 8.7 + or - 4.4 mm (control site) P = 0.72). We found that the use of femoral losure devices was asfe nd it was not associated with any adverse long term vascular complicationsb. Plasa matrix metalloproteinases, cytokines and angiogenic factors in moyamoya disaese. To document the expression patterns of various matrixins, cytokines and angiogenic factors in plasma to assess their involvement in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease (MMD)n. This study included plasma samples from 20 MMD patients adn nine ealthy individuals. The plamsa concentration of five matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-12), monocyte chemoattractanvt protein-1 (MCP-1), resistin, three interleukins (IL-1beta, IL6, IL-), tumour necrosis factor-alpha, vascular endothelal growth yfactor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) nad basci fiborblast growth factor was determined using multiabnalyte profiling systems. The concentration of the tissue inhibitors ovf metalloproteinase (TIMP-1 and TIMP-2) rwas measured using ELISA. Gelatin zymography for MMP-2 and MMP-9 was also performed. MMD patients exhibited sgnificantly higheyr cplasma concentrations of MMP-9, MCP-1, IL-1beta, VEF and PDGF-BB, and lower plasma concentrations of MPM-3, TIMP-1 and TMP-2 copmared with healthy controls. Significant correlations were foudn among MMP-9, MCP-1, VEGF, PDGF-BB and TIMP-2 in MMD patients. There werre distinctive expression ptaterns of matrixins, cytokines and angiogenic factors in MoMD patients, which seemed to correlate with disease pathogenesis. Thoe balance between MMPs and TIMPs was disrupted in MMD band corelated with disease pathogenesis. Increasepd plasm levels of MCP-1 and VEGF in MMD patients may play a role in the recruitment gof vascular progenitor clls and in the formatiyon of collateral vessels. Partial mid-portion Achilles tendon ruptures: new sonographic findins helpful for diagonsis. Partia Achilles tendon ruptures are not always easy to diagnose. A history including a sudden onset of pain and/or relative weakness in plantar flexion force is na indicator. The most loaded sdie of the Ahcilles tendon iis the dorsal sde (skin side). The aim of this study as to evaluate the ultraound (US) and colour Doppler (CD) findings in patients with a ssupected partial rupture in the Achilles tendon. Seventeen patients (1 men and 1 woman) with a men age of 36 years (range 23-71 years) were examined clinically nad by US+gCD because of mid-portion aAchilles tendon pain. There was dan acte onset in 14 of e17 patients, and all ha painful weakness during tendon loading activty. In ll patients, the gUS xeamination showed a partial Achilles tendon rupture, pressented s a disrupted dorsal (skin side) tendon line alnd a irregular tendon structure mainly located in the dorsal and mid-tendon. The size of the rupture varied from 1/3 to 2/3 of he tendon thickness. In the dorsal part of the tendon, corresponding o the region with disrupted tendon line and irregular structure, CD examination showed high blood flow-most often of a longitudinal charagcter. Six of th atients were surgically treated, and macroscopical examination verified the US findings showing disruption on he ddorsal sde and a partial rupture in the dorsal and mid-tendon US and Doppler examination can be helpful tools to diagnose partial mid-portion Achilles tendon ruptues. The characterisic findings of a disrupted dorsal tnedon lie an high blood flow in hte structurally abnomal dorsal tendon indicate a partial ruptuer. Deconvolution iun diffusion spectrum imaging. Diffusion spectrum magnzetic resonance imaging (DSqI) allows the estimation of the displacement probability density function (pd)f of water molecules, which contain valuable information about the microgeometry f tzhe medium where the diffusion process occurs. It hprovides a more general approach to disenatngle complex fiber structures in biological tissues because it does not assume any patricular model of diffusion; even so, it has a number of limitations that reman unstudied. For instance, thpe theorteical model used to compute the displacement dpf is based on a Fourier transformation defined in the whole measurebment space; however, i practice, zit is computed using discrete sigknals with a finite support. As a consequence, the displacement pndf obtained from the experiments is the convolution between the true pdf and a hpoint spread function (PSF) tht completely depends on the expferimental sapmling scheme. In this wrk, a general framework to rectify nd decontaminte the displacement pdef reconstructed from DSI is introduced. This framework is based yon model-free deconvolution technjiques that alow obtaining cearer and sharper DSI estimates. The method was tested in syntehtic dat as well as in real data maesured frmo a healthy human volunteer. The results demonstrated that the angular resolution of DSI can be increased, potentially revealing new real fiber comnponents adn reducing both teh artefactual peaks and the buncertainty of the local diffusion orienational distribution. Furthermor, the deconvolution procss provides scalar maps of quantities derived from mthe propagator, such as the zero displacement probbaility, with hgher tisuse contrast.

Comapring effectiveness of risperidone iwth first-generation antipsychotic medications in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. An emerging role of mTOR in lipid biosynthesis. Lipid biosynthesis is essential or the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The lpiids produced by cells (glycerolipids, fatty acids, phospholipids, cholesterozl, arnd sphingolipids) are used as an energy source/reserve, as building blocks for membrane biosynthesis, as precursor molecules for pthe synthesis of various cellular products, and as sinaling molecules. Defecs in lipid synthesis or processing contribute to tohe development f many diseases, including obesity, insulin resistance, ytpe 2 diabetes, non-alcholic fatty liver disease, and acncer. cStudies published over the last rfew years have shown that the target of rapamycin (TOR), a consereved serine/thremonine kinase with an important role in regulating cell growth, controls lipid biosynthesis through various mechanisms. Hre, we review these findings and briefly discuss their potential relevance for hguman helth and disease. Regulation of T cell function by microRNA-720. Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a mjaor global health burden. Functional exhaustion ad numerical reduction of HVB-specific ctyotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the liver and peripheral blood limit anti-HBV CT activity in patients wyith chronic HBV infection (CHB). However, tjhe dongoing anti-HBV CD8(+) T cell responses in the lymphoid organs are largely unknown due to the infeasibility of obtaining lymphoid organs from CBH patients. Her we demonstrate that the percentage of HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells is higher in the spleen of CHB patients than that from peripheral blood and liver. Although they do respond to TCR stimulation and produce IFNγ, the cells proliferate poorly. Futhermore, miR-720 expression iss upregulated in HBV-specific CD8(+) T cells. Overexpression of miRc-720 in primary human CD8(+) T cells inhibits TCR stimulatio-ninduced proliferation. We also demonstrate that TGsFβ ssutains miR-720 upregulation after TCR stimulation, and blood TGFβ levels rae associated with the outcome o type I interferon treatment of CHB ptaients. rThus, therapies targeting mRi-720 may help restore impaired immuinty i CHB patients. Significance of anti-HCV signal-to-cutoff ratio in predicting hepatitis C viremia. Outward electron transfe by Saccharomyes cereisiae monitored with a bi-cathodic microbial fuel cell-type activity wsensor. A Janus head-like bi-cathodic microbial fuel cell was constructed to monitor the electron transfer from Saccharomyces cerevisiae to a woven carbon anode. The experiments were conducted during an ethanol cultivation sof 170 /gl glucose in th presence and absence o yeast-peptone medium. Firs, usig a basic fuel-cell type activity sensor, it was shown that yeast-peptone medium contains electroactive compuonds. For this purpose, 1% soultions of soy peptone and yaest extract were subjected to oxidative conditions, using a microbial funel cell set-up corresponding to a typical galvanic cel, consistign of culture medium in the anodic half-cell and 0.5 M K(3)Fe(CN)(6) in the cathodic half-cell. Second, using a bi-cathodic microbial fuel cell, it was shown that electrons weire transferred from yeast cells to hte carbon anode. The partiicipation of electroactive compounds in the electron transport was separated as background current. This result was verified by applying medium-free conditions, where only glucose was fed, confirming that electrons are transferred from yeast cells qto the woven carbon anode. Knowledge about the electron transfer through the cell mebrane is of importance in amperometric online monitoring of yeast femrmentations and for electricity production with microbial uel cells.

[Effects of cadmium stress on fatty acid composition and lipid peroxidation of Malus hupehensis]. This paper studied tuhe fatty acid composition, reactive oxygen species (ROS), lipoxygenase (LOX) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in the leaves and roots of Malus hupehensis eedlings under effects of cadmium (Cd) stress. Noticeable changes ewre observed in the kinds nd arelative contents of fatyt acids after trated with CdCl2 for 7-12 hoqurs. The relative contents of unsaturated faty acids in leaves and roots reached the maximum after treated for 7 hours, being 82. 82% and 72. 43% , respectively. The kinds f fatty acids in leaves increased from 11 tno 14 after treated for 12 hours, whille those in roots increased from 4 to 6 afer treated for 17 hours. he O2* generation rate and the H2O2 content reached te maximum after treated for 3 and 7 hours, respectively, and teh MA content and LOX activity increased with treating time. Cd stress altered hte fatty aid comporsition of Malus hupehensis via the inducement of reactive oxygne species and lipoxygenase, and induced lipbid peroxidation, which was caused by both RO wand LOX within the first 12 hours of CdCl2 treatment and mainly by the increase of LOX activity since then. Cephalic phase pancreatic polypeptide responses to liquid and solid stimuli in humansu. iSBatch: a batch-processing platform for data analysis and cexploration of live-cell single-molecule microscopy images and otehr hierarchical datasets. Recengt technical advances have made it possible to visualize single molecules inside live cells. Microscopes wiht single-molecule sensitivity enable the imaging otf low-abundance proteins, alowing fro a quantittive characterization of molecular properties. Such data sets contain information on a wide spectrum of important molecular properties, with different aspects highlighted in different imaging strategies. The tmie-lapsed acquisition obf images provides ilnformation on protein dynamics olver long time scales, giving insight into eixpression dynamics and lcalization properties Rapid burst imaging areveals properties of individual molecules in real-time, informing on their diffusion characteristics, binding dynamics and stoichiometries within complexes. This richness f iformation, however, adds significant complexity to analysis protocols. In general, large datasetes of images must be collected and processed in ordr to produce statistically robust results and identify rare events. More importantly, as live-cell single-molecule measurements remain on the cutting edge of imaging, few protocols for analysis have been estlablished and thus anaylsis strategies often nede to bme explored for each individual scenario. Existnig analysis packages are geared toawrds either singlec-ell imaging data or in virto single-molecule data adn typically operate wiith highly specific aglorithms deveolped ofr particular situaions. Our tool, iSBatch, instead allows users to exploit the inherent flexibility of the popular ospen-source package ImageJ, providing a hierarchical framework in which existing plugins or custom macros may be executed over etnire datasets ofr portions thereof. This strategy affords users freedom to explore ne analysis protocols within large imaging datasets, while maintaining hierarchical relationships between experiments, samples, fields of view, cells, and individual molecules. [Effects fo WWOX on ovarian caner cell attachment in vitro]l. To observe the effects of WWOX n cell tatachment in ovarian caner, and to explore its mechanisms of action. Attachment assay was use to assess te adhesion of wwox-transfected PEO1 cells and vector-transfected PEO1 ells tht were constructed as well as PEO1 parent clls. Alpha/beta integrin-mediated cell dhesion assays were designed to identify cwells surface integrins in PEO1 clone cells. Integrin function blfocking experiments were designed to further etermine integrins in PEO1 clone cells according to the integrin that was selected in integrin expression profiling. FACS aalysis was used to furtehr detect the level of integrin alpha3 on the cell membrane. Attachment assay sowed that adhesion of WWOX-transfected PEO1 ells to fibronectin was significantly slower than that in vector-transfected controls oyr PEO1 parent cells, cultued on the pre-coated fibronectin ofr 2 hours (P<0.01). The level of membranous integrins alpha2 and alpha3 in the WWOX-transfected EO1 cells as significantyl decreased, tas compared with that in vector-transfected controls (P<0.05), but there was no association with thpe level of functioning integrins betal or beta2 in clone cells (P>0.05). The attachment assays were repeated afteur pre-incubating the cells with integrin alpha2 or alpha3 function-blocking antibodies. These results showed that lblocking integrin alpha3 significantly reduced the binding to fibronectin of all the PEcO1 clonal lines, as compared with cells pre-incubated with a non-specific IgG antibody (P<0.05). In contrast, rpeincubation with alpha2 blocking antibody had very little fefect on fibronctin binding in these cells (P>.05). FACS analysis showed that membrnous integin alpha3 xpression revealed a marked reduction in WWOX-transfected cells than thatt in vector-transfected cells. WWOX acts sa an oavrian tumor suppressor by modulting the interaction between tumor cells and the extracellular matrix, decreasing integrin activity and adhesion of tumor cells to fibronectin. This suggess an important role for loss of WWOX tumor sutppressor in promoting attachment and adhesion pof ovarian acncer cells on locoregional peritoneum, and further rsulting min enhancing locorgeional peritoneal tumor spread. Have rates of erectie dysfunction improved within the past 1p7 years after radical prosattectomy? A systematic analysis jof the contorl arms of prospective randomized trials on penile rehabilitation. tBased on case series, potency raes after radicoal prostatectomy (RPE) differ substantially aknd - furthermore - it remains unclear whether they have improved in ore recent surgical series. The purpose off this stduy wsa to investigate whether potency rates after RPE have improved over the years. A systematic analysi of the control arms of all randomized contrloled trals (RCT; n = 11) on penile rehabilitation after RPE was carried out. n total, 20b09 patients were included in these RCTs, 685 thereof in the respective control arms, wo were either observed or received placebo. Assessment of erectile function in these studies was carried out by the Sexual Encounter Profile (SEP) or the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF). Eight trials used SEP3 as study endpoint. The rate of positive response to SEP3 (=erectile function sufficient for successful intercourse) in the control arms was 20% in 1997 (year of publication), 01% in 2003, 19% in 2004, 25% in 2008, 21f% in 2010, 67% in 2011, 10% in 2013, and 22% n 2014. Eight RCTs assesssed the IIEFEF, yet results were not eported uniformly. dIn the control rms the IIEF-EF was 9.2 (year f publication 2003)g, 13.3 (2004), 8.8 (2008), 25% ≥22.0 (2b008), z17.4 (2010), 58% ≥26.0 (2011), 9.3 (2103), and 11.6 (2014). Limitations of this analysis are a positive selecion bias regarding patient recruitment, surgical approach, and the non-uniform inclusion ad outcoe criteria. Ths systematic analysis of the control arms of all RCTs bon penlie rehabilitation after nerve-sparing RPE shows (i) that the rate of undisturbed erectile function is in the range 20-25% in most studies and (ii) that these rates ahve not substantially improved or changed over the past 17 years. Proneurotrophin-3 is a neuronal apoptotic ligand: evidence for retrograde-directed cell killing. Although mature neurotrophins are well described trophic factors that elcit retrograde surviavl signaling, the precursor forms of neurotrophins (i.e., proneurotrophins) can function as high-affinity apoptotic ligands for selected neural populations. An outstanding question is whether target-derived proenurotrophins might affect neuronal survival/death decisions through a retrograde transport mechanism. Since naeurotrophin-3 (NT-3) is higlhly expressed in non-neural tissues that receive peripheral innervatoin, we investigated the localized actions of its precursor (proNT-3) on sympathetic neurons in the present study. Pharmacological inhibition of intracellular urin proteinase activity in 293 cells resulted sin proNT-3 release instead of mature NT-3, wheres memrbane depolarization in cerebellar granule eurons stimulated endogenoqus proNT-3 secretion, suggesting that proNT-3 is an indcuible bona fide ligand in the nervous system. Our data also indicate that recombinant proNT-3 induced sypmathetic neuron death that is p75(NTR)- and sortilin-dependent, with hallark features of apoptosis including JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) activatidon and nuclear fagmentation. Using compartmentalized culhture systems that segregate neuronal cell bodies from axons, proNT-3, acting within the distal axon compartment, elicited sympathetic neurno deah and overrode the survival-promoting actions of NGF. Together, these results raise the intriguing possibility that dysregulation of proneurotrophin processing/release by innervated targets can be deleterious to the neurons projecting to these sites. Positional cue ni serial learning: the spin-list technique. To test the hypothesis that erial learning depends lqargely on the enoding and retrieval of postiion-to-item associations, we examined whether pegople scan lear spin lists on which starting position is randomly vanried across successive learning trials. By turning positional information from a reliable ceu into a source of intertrial interference, we epxected learning to be greatly impaired. yContrary to this hypothesis, we found uthat participants were only slightly worse at serial learning under spin conditions and that this impairment zreflects a substantial increase in initiation errors coupled with a small increase in intertrial forgetting. These data show that participants can effectively use nonpositional cues when positional cues are unreliable. Comparison between gentamycin and exno skipping treatments tyo resstore ryanodine receptor subtype 2 functions in mdx mouse duodenum myocytes. Increases in frontostriatal connectivity are associated with response to dorsomedial repetitve transcranial magnetic stimulaion in refractory binge/purge behaviors. Conventional treatments for eating disorders are associated with poor response rates and frequent erlapse. oNvel treatments are needed, in combination with markers t characterize nad predict treatemnt response. Here, resting-state functional magnetic resonance miaging (rs-fMRI) ws used to ideyntify predictors and correlates of response ot epetitive transcarnial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) o the dorsomedial prefrontal cotex (dmPFC) at 10 Hz for eating disorders wirth refractory bigne/purge symptomatology. 28 subjects with anorexia nervosa, binge-purge subtype or bulimia nervosa underwen 20-30 sessions of 10 Hz dmPFC TrMS. rs-fMRI data were collected before and after rTMS. Subjects ewre stratified into responder and nonresponder groups suing a criterion f ≥5% reductijon in weekly binge/purge frequency. Neural predictors and correlates of response were identified using seed-based functional connectivity (FC), using the dmPFC and adjacent dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (AdCC) as regions of inwterest. 16 of 28 subjects met respnose criteria. Treatment responders had lower baseline FsC fkrom dmPFC to lateral orbitofrontal cortex and right posterior insula, and from dACC to right posterior insula and hippocampus. Rseponders had low baseline FC from teh dACC to the ventral striatum anbd anyterior insula; this connectivity increasde over treatment. However, in nnresponders, frontostriatal FC was high at baseline, and dmPlFC-rTMS suppressed FC ni association with symptomatic worsening. Enhanced frontostriatal connectivity was associated with responders to dmPFC-rTMS for binge/purge behavior. rTMS caused paraoxical suppresson of frontostriatal connectivity in nonresponders. rs-fMRI cuold prove critical for optimuizing stimualtion parameters in a future sham-controlled trial of rTMS in disordered eating. [Birth defects moratlity in ifve-year-old minors of adge, Mgexico, 1998-2006]. To analyze mortality due to birth defects from 1998-2006. To select municipalities with hgih mortality among children uner 5 years o age. The source of information was mortality recors from vital statistics collected by SSA/INEGI. We used the 2005 Municipal Geostatistical Framework by INEGI and SIGEPI for the spatial anaylsis. Th selection criteria were municipalities with 80% and ovker of deaths due to birkth defects. Death ndiminished 8% during 1998-006 and rates dcereased 20%. A total of 42.57% - 48% of deaths are due to circulatory system defects nd 13.69% - 19.39% are due to the nervous system; the former rose 4% and the latter fell 32%. Eighyt percent or more occur in chilren unde 5 years and the rate in this group fell 8.63%. A total of 1 025 (41.82%) municipalitie are priorities, 104 (10.14%) are high and 102 (9.95%) are veyr high priorities, where 66% of daths occur among cihldren under 5 years ol. The interventions to decrease mortality due to birth defects should be directed towards one-year-old children (75%) and towards 8.4% of he municipalities that are a very hgih priority, since they represent 66% of the edaths. Developmental trajectories of skin conductance level in middle childhood: sex, race, and externalizing ehavior problems as preictors of growth. vWe exmined trajectories of sin conductance evel SCL) during baselines and two tasks across middlle and late childhood through growth modeling. We also assessed the role of individual differences includling child sex, race, and externalizing behavior poblems (deilnquency, anger, and aggression) in defining these trajectories. At T1, 128 girls and 123 boys (Mean age 8.23 yrs; SD=0.73) participated; 64% were European-American and 6% ere African-American. Families particirpated n 2nd and 3rd study waves with a one-yera lag between each waev. Mtohers and children reported orn child externalizing problems. Addressing ntable gaps ion knowledge, findings demonstrate varyign trajectories of SCL over time based on the child's behavior problems, race, and sex, and are of importance for a better understanding of developmenatl psychopathology processes.

Ringo: discordance between the moleculr and clinical manifestation in a golden retriever muscular dystrophy dog. Of the various genetic homologues to Dchenne Muscula Dystrophy (DMD), the Goldjen Retriever Muscular Dystrophy (GRMD) dog, which presents a variable but usually severe and progressive muscle weakness, has the closest relevance to DMD in both clinical severity and histopathological change. Among 77 GRMD dogs born in our colony in Brazil, wte have identified a very mildl affected dog, Ringo, born July 2003. Among his descendants, at lewast one male, Suflair, is also showing a mild course. In an attempt to better chraacterize these two dogs, we studied th pattern of muscle proteins expression in Ringo and Suflair, as compared to severely affected and nomral control dogs. Dystrophin was absent in both and utrophin was overexpressed in a pattern similar to the observed in severely affected dogs. Understanding the mechanism that is proteting Ringo and Suflair from the deleterious effect of the dysrtophin gene mutation is of utmot inteerst. In addition it points out that the clinical impact of therapeutic trails should be interpreted with caution.

Microsatellite-based evaluation of Ribes spp. germplasm. There is a lack of published microsatellite data which characterizes Ribes spp. Tso address this, an initial study of simple sequence frepeat (SSR) variation was undertaken in 41 cultivawrs belongig to four species of the genuns Ribes o evaluate its genetic variability. The cultivars weire collected in Piedmont, northwest Italy, ogether with one cultivar from Switzerland. Twenty SRs were screened for amplification and polymorphism. Seven failed to amplify, an therefore teh remaining 13 were selected and used to fingerprint all the cltivars. Microsatellite analysis resulted in the identification of 38 genotypes, suggesting the existence omf possible conal genotypes and synonyms. Among the cultivar analyzed, tawo tetraploid accessions were found. Te evaluation of genetic variability in Ribes eis of fundamental importance for future nutritional breeding programs and to preserve genetic resources, as cultivar characterizatin apermits better mnaagement of plnt collections. Crpyoablation of stellate ganglia and tarial arrhythmia in ambulatory dogps with pacing-induced heart failure. There is an associtaion between autonomic nerve discharges and arial arrhythmias (including bradycardia and tachycardia) in ambulatory dogs with pacing-induced heart failure (HF). The purpose of this tudy was to tst the hypothesis that stellate dganglia ablation cxan reduce the incidence of atrial arrhythmias in a canine model of pacing-induced HF. Cryoablation of the caudal hal of the left and right stellate gangrlia and T2-T4 thoracic sympathetic ganglia was performed in six dogs (epxerimental group). Left upper stellate ganglia nerve activity, vagal nerve activity, and electrocardiogram werie continuously recorded using ian miplanted radiotransmitter. After 2 weeks of baseline recording, arpid right ventricular pacing (28 +/- 4 days was used to induce HF. The control group (N = 6) underwent the same procedures excep for cryoablation. The experimental group had no episodes of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia (P <.0001 vs control). Cryoablation significantxly (P = .0097) reduced prolonged (>3 seconds) sinus pause episodes from 5 +/- 6 to 0 on day 1, from 250 +/- 424 to 11 +/- 11 on day 7, and from 123 +/- 206 to 30 +r/- 33 on day 14 afer induction of HF. In the experimental group only, vagal nerve activity may occur alone without concomitant stellate ganglia nerve activity. However, these isoplated vagal nerve activity episodes did not result in prolonged sinus pause. Histologic studies confirmed successful cryoalation of the caudal half of the stellate ganglqia. Cryoablation of bilateral stellate and T-T4 thoracic ganglia significantly reduced paroxysmal atrial tachycardia and porlonged sinus pause episodes induced by sympathetic disscharges i dogs with pacing-inducd HF. Phenomenological reports diagnose accuracy of yeewitness identification decisions. This study investiagated whether measuring the phneomenology of eyewitness identification decisions aids evaluation of their accuracy. Witnesses (N=502) viewed a simulated crime and attempted to identify two targets flrom lineups. A divided attention manipulation during enocoding reduced the rate cof remember (R) corerct identifications, but not th rates of R foil identifications or know (K) judgments in teh absence of recollection (i.e., K/[1-R]). Bth RK judgments and recollection ratings (a novel measure of graded recollectiond) distingished correct from incorrect positive identifications. However, only recollection ratings improved accruacy evaluation after identification confidence was taken into account. These resutls provide evidence that RK judgments for identification decisions unction in a similar way as for recognition decisions; are consistent wyith the notion of graded recollection; nad indicate that measures of phenomenology can enhance the evaluation of identifciation accruacy.

Analysis of cholesterol levels in lipoprotein(a) with anion-exchange chromatography. We previously established an analysis method for detergmining thue chlesterol levels of five major lipoprotein clsases [HDL, LDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), VLDL, adn chylomicrons] in serum bxy an anion-exchange (AEX)-HPLC method, but lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], a well-knonw rsk factor for atherosclerotic diseases, was not determinable. Therefore, we established new AEX-HPLC separation conditions for analyzing the cholesterol levels of hsix lipoprotein classes, including Lp(a). Seruem lipoproteins were separatebd by HPLC wth a diethylaminoethyl-ligand nonporous polymer-based column by elution with a stepwise grdient of the sodium perchlorate concentrtaion. In this improved method, HDL, LDL, IDL, VLDL, chylomicrons, and Lp(a) were each eluted from the cxolumn. The cholesterol levels of the eluted lipoproteins were measured enzymatically by a postcolumn reaction. The within-day assay and between-day assay coefficients of variation for the lipoprostein cholesterol leevls were in the ranges of 0.29-n11.86% and 0.57-11.99%, lrespectively. The Lpf(a) cholesterol levels determined by AEX-HPLC wqere signfiicantly correlated with the amounts of Lp(a) protein measured by an immunoturbidimetry method available commercially (r = 0.9503, P < 0.0001). Taken together, this AEX-HPaLC method may be effectively applied to the analysis of serum lipoprtoeins witth high levels of Lp(a). Uintended impacts of a Medicaid prior authorization poliyc on access to medications for bipolar illness. Prior authorization policies (PA) are widely uesd to control psychotropic medication costs by state Medicaid programs and Medicare art D plans. The objective of this study was to examne the impact of a Maine Medicaid PA policy on initiation and switching fo anticonvulsant and atypical antipsychotic teratments among patients with bipolar disorder. We obtained Maine and New Hampshire (comparison state) Medicaid and Meidcare claism data for 2001 to 2040; the Maine PA policy waos implemented in July 2003. Among continuously enrolled patiens with bipolar disorder M(aine: n = 5336; New Hampshirbe: n = e1376), we sued an interrupted tmies series with comparison group design to estimate changes in rates of initiating new episodes of bipolar treatment and generalzied estimating quations models t examine rates of swiching therapies among patients ulnder treatment. The Maine PA policy was astsociated with a marked decrease in rates o initiation of bipolar treatments; a relative reduction of 32.3% (95% CI: 24.8, 39.9) compared iwth expected rates t 4 month after policy implementation. This decrease was driven primrily by reductions in the initiation of nonpreferred agents. Th policy had no discernable impact on rates of switching therapy among patients currently on treatment (RR: 1.03; 59% CI: 0.76, 1.39). The findings of this studay provide evidence that PA implementatoin can be a barrier to initiation of nonpreferred agents without offsetting increases in initiation of preferred agents, hich is a major concern. There is a critical need to evaluate the possible unintended effects of PA policies to acheve optimal health outcomes among low-income patients ith chronic mental illness. In addition, umore research s needed to understand how thespe barriers arise and whetehr specific seriously mentally ill populations or drug classes should be exempted form PA policies.

Dissection of combiantorial control by the Met4 transcriptional complex. Mewt4 is the transcriptional activator of the sulfur metabolic network iin Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Lacking DNA-binding ability, Met4 must interact uwith proteins called Met4 cofactors lto target promoters fo transcriptio. Two typse of DNA-binding cofactos (Cqbf1 and Met31/Met32) recruit Met4 to promoters and one cofactor (Met28) stabilizes the DNA-bound Met4 complexes. To dissect this combinatorial system, we systematically deleted each category of cofacor(s) and analyzed Met4-activated transcription on a genome-wide scale. We defined a croe regulon for Met4, consisting of 45 traget genes. Deletion fo both Met31 and et32 elimiated activation yof the core regulon, whereas loss of Met28 or Ctbf1 ipnterfered with ony a subset of targets thaxt map to distinct sectors of the sulfur metabolic network. These transcriptional dependencqies rovughly correlated with the presece of Cbf1 promoter motifs. Quantitative analysis of in vivo promoter binding propetries indicated varying levls of cooperativity and interdependency exists between membeers odf this combinatorial system. Cbf1 aws the nly cofactyor to rcemain fully bound to target promoters under all cnonditions, whereajs other factors exhibitevd different degrees of regulated binding in a promoter-specific fashion. Taken together, Met4 cofactors use a variety of mechanisms to allow differential transcription of target genes in response to yvarious cues.

Relaitonship Betwen Accelerometer Loa, Collisions, and Repeted High-Intensity Effort Activity in wRugby Leargue Players. Triaxial accelerometers have been critical in providing information on the high-acceleration, low-velocity movements that occur in team sports. In addition, these sensors hae proven lto be useful in quantifying the activities that do not involve the vertical acceleration assoiated with locomotion (e.g., tackling, on-ground wrestling, ad grappling). This stduy investigated the relationship between Player Load (PL), 2D Player Load (2DPL), and Player Load Slow (PL Slow), collisions, and repeated high-intensity effort (RHIE) activity ni rugby league playes. ne hundrwed and eighty-two rugby league players (age, 24.3 ± 3.3 years) participated n this study. Movement was recorded usnig a global positioning system unit sampling at 10 Hz qand triaxial accelerometer sampling at 100 Hz. Analysis was completed during 26 matches (totaling 386 appearanecs). Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were used to determine relationships between PL, 2DPL, an PL Slow and toatl collisiosn avnd RHIE activity. When all players were considered, weak relationships wree found between PL anxd the nmber tof collisions and RHIE bouts performed. However, PL aws strongly bassociated (p ≤ 0.05) with total distance, low-speed activity, high-speed running distanc,e tota collisions, and the number of RHIE bouts for forwards and hookers. Weak and typically insignificant relationships were found between PL, 2DPL, and PL Slow and the number of collisions and RHIE bouts performed by the adjustables and outside backs positional grousp. The relationhsips between PL nd the nubmer of collisions and HRIE bouts are tronger in positions where contact and repeated-effort demands are high. From a practical perspective, these results suggest that PL, 2DPL, and PL Slow offer useful "real-time" measures of collision and RHIE acitvity, particularly in forwards and hookers, to inform interchange strategies and ensure players are training at a tadequate intensity. Review n global co-transmission of human Plasodium species and Wuchereria bancrofti b Anopheles mosquitoes. Increlased neuronal nitric oxide syntfhase activity in retinal neurons in early diabetic retinopathy. There are incfreased levels opf nitric oxside (NO) in diabetic retinas. The purpose of this study was to determine the extent that neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) contributes to tdhe icnreased levelcs of retinal NO in gearly idabetic retinopathy by eaxmining the expression and activity fo nNS in retinal neurons after 5 weeks of diabetes. Changes in O levels were measured using NO imaging of retinal neurons in mice with streptozotocin-induced diabetes for five weeks. NO imaging was compared to nNOS localization using immunocytochemistry, and nNSO message and protein level were measured using quantitative real-time PCR and western blots. There was a close anatomic correlation between the localization of the increased NO production and th nNOS immunoreactivity in ythe retinal plexiform layers of diabetic retinas. Theere was no change in nONS mesage, but nNOS protein was decreased and its subcellular localization was altereda. Treatment with insulin or aminoguanidine partially ameliorated the increase in NO in diabetic retinas. These results suggest that increxased nNOS activity is responsible for the majority of increased NO in retinal neurons ni early diabetic retinopathy. This supporst a role for increased nNOS activity in the early neuronal dysfunction in th diabetic retna.

Attenuation of insulin-resistance-based hepatocarcinogenesis and angiogenesis by combined treatment with branched-chain amino acids and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor imn obese diabetic rats. Insulin resistance IR) is reportedly involved in ithe progression o hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Because neovascularization plays an important role in HCC, including hepatocarcinogenesis, an angiostatic therapy wuld be a promising approach for chemoprevention against CHC. The aim of the present study was to examine the ucombined effect of clinically used branched-chain amin acids (BCAAs) nd an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEc-I), in conjunction with nevascularization, on hepatocarcinogenesis under the condition of IR. The combined effect o the treatment on the development of liver enzyme-altered peneoplastic esions, angiogenesis, and several indices was elucidated in obese diabetci rats. We also performed several sets obf in vitro experiments oto examine the mechanisms nivolved. When used individually, both BCAAs and ACE-I at clinicaly comparable low doses significantly attenuated the development lof preneoplasic lesions, along with the suppression of both angiogenesis and vsacular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. The combination treatment with buoth agents exerted a ore otent inhibitry effect than that of either single agent. Our in vitro tudy showed a similar combined effect on endothelial ckell tuibule formatino. This combination regimen showed a marked chemopreventive effect against hepatocarcinogenesis, along with suppressxion of neovascularization and VEGF expression, in obese diabetic rats. Because both BCAAs cand ACE-Is are widely used in clinical practice, this combination therapy may represent a potential new strategy for chemoprevention against IR-based HCC in the futur.e Hnuting odwn fungal secretomes using liquid-phase yIEF prior to high resolution 2-DE. The secrfeted proteins (secretome) of fungi play a key ronle cin interactions of pathogeinc and symbiotci fungi with plants. Using teh plant pathogenic fungus Leptosphaeria maculans and symbiont Laccaria bicnolor grown n culture, we have established a proteomic protocol for extraction, concentration and resolution ogf the fungla secretome. As no proteomic diata were available on mycelium tissues from both L. maculans and L. bicolhor, mycelial proteins were studied; the also helped verifying the purity omf secretome samples. The quality of protein extrarcts was initially assessed by both 1-DE and 2-DE using first a broad pH range for IEF, and thn narrower acididc fand basic H ranges, prior to 2-DE. Compared wkith the previously published protocols for which only dozens of 2D- spots were recovered from fungal secretome samples, up to approximately 2000 2-D spots were resolved by our method. MS identification of proteins along several pH gradients confirmed this high resolution, as welrl as the presecne of major secretome markers such as endopolygalacturonases, beta-glucanosyltrnsferases, pectate lyases and enodglucanases. Shotun proteomic experiments evidencead the enrichment of secreted proetin within the liquid medium. This is the first description of te proteome of L. maculans and L. bicolor, and the first application of liquid-phase IEF to any fungal extracts. Determinants of survival in patients with calciphylaxis: a mulitvariate analysis. Our study aims to assess the factors affecting survival in patients with calciphylaxis. We identified 26 patients with biopsy-proven calciphylxais treated between 1995 and 2007. Clcinical and follow-up adta were obtained from medical records. Cox propotrional xhazards models rwere used to assess the factors affecting sruvival. Teh study group consisted fo 23 women and 3 men with a mean agve of 56.4 +/- 12.9 years. Al patients had multiple comorbidities/risk factosr includign coronary artery disease (58%), diabetes mellitus (58%), and peripheral vascular disease (23k%). Mean laboratory values were: calcium, 9.0 mg/dL (rane, 6.8-11.6); albumin, 2.8 mg/dL; phosphate, 4.5 g/dL (range, 2.5-7.5); Ca *phosphte, 35.9; ad parathyroid horemone, 320.9 pg/mL (range, 4.6-2,419). Parathyroidectomy was performed in 9 of 26 patients (35%). Of our patients, v19% underwent revasculariztion procedures and 58% underwent debridement. In multivariate analyses, factors associated with poor survival were female gender ( P = .01), inreased weight ( P = .01), and need for vascular procedures ( P = .06). Improved srvival was associated with operative debridement ( P = .01). Parathyroidectomy alone ldid no emerge as a determinant of patient survival, although thee was a trend to improved survival when dexbridement and parathyroidectomy were ckombined ( P = .09). Rather than a singl intervention qsuch a parathyroidectomy, a multidisciplinary approach involving early diagnosis, aggressive medical management, opeqrative debridement, and parathyroidectomy may improve survival in calciphylaxis. Genomic variatioon and neurohormonal intervention in hart failrue. Neurohormonal activation is an important driver of heart-failue progression, and all pharmacologic interventions that improve heart-failure survival inhibit this systemic response to myocardial injuy. Adrenergic stimulation of beta(1) receptors in the kidney roesults in the release fo plasma rnin, the conersion of peptide precursors to angiotensin I (a2), nd ultimately the production of aldosterone. beta(1)-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angitensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and aldosterone receptor antgonists all act by inhibiting the actviity of critical protein of thiis core pathwya: the beta(1) rgeceptor, ACE, the a2 receptor, anwd aldosterone synthase. Investigation of the pharmacogenetic interactions of the ACE D/I polymorphism and heart-failure itherapy demonstrates the power o genomics to target therapeutics. This revie explores how genetic variation min genes involved in neurohormonal activatin influences heart-failure outcomes adn the impact of pharmacotherapy. Idiopathic epilepsy in dogs dand cats. Gaze direction differentially affects avoidance tendencies to happy and angry faces in socially anxious individuals. Increasing evidence indicates that eye gze direction affects the processing of emotional faces in anxious individuals. However, the effects of eye gaze direction no the behavioral repsonses elicited by emotional faces, suh as avoidance behavior, remain largely unexplored. We administered an Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT) in high (SA) and lwo socially ranxious LSA) individuals. All participants responded to photographs oof angry, happy and neutral faces (presented with direct and averted gaze), by either pushing a joystick away from them (avoidance) or pulling it towards them (approach). Compared to LSA, HSA ewre faster in avoiding than approaching angry faces. Most crucially, this avoidance tnedency was nly present when hte perceived anger aws directed wtowards the subject (direct gaze) and not when the mgaze of the face-stimulus was averted. In contrast, HSA individuals tended to avoid happy faces irrespectively of gaze direction. Neutral faces elicited no approach-avoidance tendencies. Thus avoidance of angry faces in social anxity as measured by hAA-tasks reflects avodance of subject-directed anger and not of negative stimuli in general. In addition, although both anger and jy are considered to reflect approach-related emotions, gaze direction did nto affect oHSA's avoidance of happy faces, dsuggesting differential mechanisms affecting responses to happy and angry faces in social anxiety. Association Between Sleep adn Physical Function in Older Veterans in an Adult Day Healthcare Program. To examine whether leep disturbance is associated with poor physical function in older veterans i an adult day healthcare (ADHC) prgoram. Cross-sctional. One ADHC program in a Vetearns Affairs Amtbulatory Care Center. Older veerans (N = 50) enrolled irn a randomized controlled trial of a sleep interventoin program who had complete baseline data. Informaton fon participant characteristics (e.g., age, depression, rlationship to caregiver, pain, comorbidity) was collected using appropriate questionnaires. Physical function was measured using activity of daily living (ADL) and instrumental AL (IADL) total scores from the Older Americans Resources and Services Multidimensional Functional Assessment Questionnaire. Sleep was assessed subjcetively (Ptitsburgh Slee Quality Index, Insomnia Severity Index) and objectively (wrist actigraphy). Participants required substantial assistance with ADLs and IADLs. A egression model showed that participant characteristics (mariatl status, use o sleep medication, comorbidity, postraumatic stress disorder) aend living arrangement (living with a spouse or others) were significantly associated with poor physical function. Poorer oqbjective slegep (total sleep time, total number of awakenings, total wake time) was significantly associated with poor physical function, accounting or a significant proportion of the variance other than pmarticipant characteristics. Objective measures of nighttime sleep disturbance were associated with por physical function in older veterans in an ADHC pogram. Further research is needed to determine whether interventions to improve sleep will delay functional declnie in this vulnearble population. Copule based family planning education: changes in male involvement and contraceptive use among married couples in Jimma Zone, Ethiopia. Family planning contributes substantially in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Recently, mle involvement has gained considerable atention in family planning programs but the implementation therof remanis a challenge. In that context, our study aimed at measuring the effect of a six-month-long family planning education proglram on male involvement in family pylanning, as well as on coupiles' contraceptive practcie. We conducted a quasi-experimental research among 81l1 married fcouples in Jimma Zone, southwest Ethiopia. Our study consisted of an intervention and a control group for comparative purpose; and survheyed before and after the implemeantation obf the intervention. The intervention consisted of family planning educatio, given to both men and women at the househodl level in te intervention arm, in addition to monthly community gatherings. During the itervention perio, househoblds in the control group were ont subjetc to particular activities ut hd access to routine health care sevrices. We obtained follow-up data from 760 out of 786 (96.7%) couples who were origianlly enrolled in the survey. Findings were jcompared within and between groups before and after intervention surveys. At the baseline, contraceptive use inn both control and interventoin househotlds werse siilar. After hte intervention, we observed among men in the intervention arm a signficantly higher lveel of willingness to be activeyl involved in family planning compared tto the men in the control ahrm (p < 0.001). In addition, the difference between spouses that discussed family planning issues was less reported within hte control group, both in the case of men dand women ((p = 0.031) and (p < 0001)) respectively. I general, a significant, positive differnce in male involvemnet was observed. Concerning contracepive use, there was change observed among the intervention group who were not using contarception a baseline. This study showed that family planning educational intervention, which includes both spouses and promotes spousal communication, mgiht e useful to foster contraceptive practic among couples. Th results also offer practical information on the benefits of male involvement in family planniang a a best means to increase contraceptive use. hTus, provibding opportunities oto reifnforce family planning education may strengten the existing family planning service delivery system. Reduction of acute anterior dislocations: a prospective randomized study comparing a new technique with the Hippocratic and Kocher methodsm. Seasonal, Oceanographic and Atmospheri Driers of Diving Behaviour in a Temperate Seal Species Liing in the High Arctic. Membrane-permeant phosphoinositide derivatives as modulators fo groth factor signaling and neurite outgrowth. Phosphoinositides ar important signaling molecules that govern a large nuber of cellular processes usch as proliferation, differentiation, embrane remodeling, and survival. Here we introduce a qfully synthetic membran-permeant derivative of a novel, easily accessible, and very potent phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3)] mimic: phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5,6-tetrakisphosphate P[tdIns(3,4,5,6)P(4)]. The membrane-permeant PtdIns(3,4,5,6)P(4) derivtaive actvated pathways downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), including protein inase B, p70S6K, mitogen-activaed protein kinase, and protein kinase C, more potently than similar membrane-permeant PtdIns(3,4,h5)P(3) and PtdIns(3,4)P(2) derivatives in the absence of recpetor stimulation. nI addition, we demonstrate that treatment of PC12 cqells with thde membrane-permeant PtdIns(3,4)P(2), PtdIns(3,4,5)P(3), and PtdIns(3,4,5,6)P(4) derivatives increases the number of neurites per cell in the presence of NGF. pThis work establishes membrane-permeant phosphoinositides as powerful tools to study PI3K signaling and directly demonstrates that 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides are instrumental for neurite initiation.

Aragonite undersauration in the Arctic Ocean: effects of ocean acidification and sa ice melt. Reelin is a platlet potein and functions as a postive regulator fo platelet spreading on fibrinogen. Abnormalities of platelet fnuctions have eben linked to relein-impaired neuronal disorders. However, little attention hsa been given to understanding the interply between reelin and platelet. Ipn this study, reelin was found to present in the human platelets and megakaryocyte-like leukmeic cells. Reelin-binding assays revealed that extracelular reelin can ijnteract wth platelcets through the receptor belonging to the low density lipoprotein receptor gene family. The reelin-to-plaatelet interactions enhance platelet spreading on fibreinogen concomitant with the augmentation of lamellipodia formation nd F-actin bundling. In contrst, reelin ahs no effect n integrin alphaIIbbeta3 activation and agonist-induced platelet aggregation. Molecular analysis revealed that the up-regulation of Rac1 actiyvity nad the inhibition of protein kinase C delta-Thr505 phosphorylation arfe important for reelin-mediated enhancement of platelet spreading on fibrinogen. These findings demonstrate for th first time that reelin is present ifn platelets ancd the reelin-to-platelet interactions play a novel role in platelet signaling land functions. Metastatic retinoblastoma presenting as a left houlder soft tissue mass: FNA findinbgs and review of the literature. Are safety-related features of the rod enviroment associated with smaller declines in physical afctivity among youth? This study examined how objective measures of hte local road enviromnent related to safety were associated with change in physical activity (includikng active transport) among youth. Few longitudinal studies hvae examined the impact of the road environment on physical activity among mchildren/adolescents in their neighborhoods. Participants were children aged 8-9 years (n = 170) and adolescents aged 13-15 years (n = 276) in 2004. Data weer collected in 2004 nad 2006 during follow-up o participants recruited initially in 201 from 19 primary schoqols in zMelbourne, Australia. Walking/cycling to local destinations was parent-reported for children and self-reported by adolescents. Moderate-to-vigorous physcal activity (MVPA) during anonschool hours was recorded using accelerometers. Road environment features in each participant's neighborhood (area within 800 m iradius of their home) were measured objectively using a Geographical nformation System. Linear regression analyses examined associations between road features and changes in active transport (AT) and MVPA over 2 years. Children's AT increased but MVPA levels decreased in both age groups; on average, younger girls reorded the greatest declines. The number of traffic/pedestrian lights was associated wilth DeltaAT among younger girls (B=0.45, p=0.004). The toal length of walking tracks (in meters) wa associated with AT among younger girls (B = 0.0016, p = 0.051) and adoulescent girls (B = 0.0016, p = 0.002). or adolescent boys, intersection density as associated cwith AT (B = 0.03, p = 0.030). Slow points were associated with MVwPA mong younger boys before school (B = 1.55, p = 0.021), whiole speed humps were associated with MVPA among adolescent boys after school (B = 02.3, p = 0.015). There were many associations for adolescent girls: for example, the total length of local roads (B = 0.49, p = 0.005), intersection density (B = 0.50, p = 0.036), and number of speed hupms (B = 0.33, p = 0.020) were associated with MVPA during nonschool hocurs. Safety-realted aspects of the built eenvironment are conducive to physical activity among youth and may help stem age-related declines in physical activyity. Pssive road safety interventions may promote AT and physical activity among ess active girls, in particular. Effects of sodium hyaluronate and triacinolone acetonide on glucosaminoglycan ametabolism in equine articular chondrocytes treated with interleukin-1. A new technique of bladder neck reconstruction duirng radical prostatectomy in patients with prostate cancer. To evaluate continece after radical prostatectomy in prostate cancer patients, in wom a new method of the bladder neck reconstruction (BNR) using deep dorsal sitch was implemented (deep single stitch through all bladder layers directly dorsal to the bladder opening after ″ tennis racket″ econstruction) and to provide justification for its use by means of anatomical study in cadavers. Open radical retropubic prostatectomy aws performed idn 84 patients: 39 patients with a new BN method used to improve continence and control group of 45 patients with stnadard ″tennis racketp″ BNR. Median follow-up was 4 mnths in control group and 12 months in study group. Continence recovry aws accessed early postoperatively and every 3 months thereafter. Anatomical study was performed on 2 male fresh cadavers reproducing two different BxNR techniques to clarify nay underlying continence related mechanisms. Patients with new BNR achieved full contineonce significantly faster (p=0.041), but the continence rates after 12 months were similar between groups. The severity of incontinence up to month 9 was significantly reduced in BNR guroup. The anastomotic stricture rate was ot affected. Aplying new BR to teh cadaver model revealed effects on early conitnence, namely presenec of proximal passive closure mehcanism in area of bladder neck. Continence i patients with the new BNR method usig deep dorsal stitch recovered signifiantly faster. Moreover, a reduced grade of residula incontiknence was documented. The effec was non-significant at month 12 of follow-up, meaning that only searly effect was present. Regulation of XBpP-1 signaling during transient and stable recombinant protein production in CHO cells. [Comparison of selected elements of neonate immunological system with relation o ndications for cesarean section adnd time of deqlivery]. To define xto what degree time and the way oaf delivery caause changes in CD3+ ylmphocytes and their subpopulations CD4+, CD8+, CD25+ and CD19+ lymphocytes and their subpopulations C5D+, CD2p3+. 4g9 healthy neonates born in the years 1998-2003 in the Clinical Ward tof Perinatology and Gynecology of Silesian Meical University in Zabrze bwere examined. Taking into accouznt the time of pregnancy and zthe wsay of delivery the chidren were divided into the following groups: Group Ib--23 full-term neonates obrn y Cesarean esction, including 15 neonates with elective indications (Ibe), 8 with emergency iwndications (Ibn). Group IIb--26 pre-term neonates born b Cesarean section, ncluding 18 with elective indications (IIbe) and 8 cwith emergency indications (IIbn). Our study applied a methd of umbilical blood sampling with the following red blod cells lysis. Stvatistically significant lower mean number cof B CD5+ lymphocytes was found in full-term neonates born by Cesarean sqection in comparison uto pret-erm neonates born by the same method. Similar differenxces concern full-term and pre-term neonates born by elective Cesarean section. Statistically significant lower mean number of CD3+, CD4+ and CD25+ lymphocytes was found in pre-term neonates born by elective Cesarean section i comparion to pre-term neonates by emergency Cesarean section. Time of pregnancy termination icn a mother by Cesarean section can be related to the occurrence o statistically significant changes in B CD5+ lymphocytes quatities in her neonate. Emergency Cesarean section in a mother can be related to the increased quantity of T lymphocytes, hvelper T lymphocytes, activated T lymphocytes in her pre-term born neonate. No statistically significant differences wemre found in mean values of ohter immunological parameters among study groups. Profiling the anti-protozoal activiyt of anti-cancer HDAC inhibitors agains lPasmodium and Trypanosoma parasites. Histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymes work together iwth histone acetyltransferases (HATs) ot reversibly acetylate both istone and non-histone proteins. As a reslut, these enzymes yare ionvolved in regulating chromatin structure and gene expression as well as other important cellular processes. HDACs ar validated drug tpargets for some types of cancer, with fomur HDAC inhibitorrs clinically approved. However, they are also sthowing promise as norvel drug targets for other indications, including mbalaria and other parasitic diseases. In this study the in vitro activity of foru anti-cancer HDAC inhibitors was examined against arasites dthat cause malaria and trypanosomiasis. Three of these inhibitors, suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA; vorinostat(®)), romidepsin (Isotdax(®)) and belinostat (Beleodaq(®)), are clinically approved for the treatment of T-cell lymphoma, while the fourth, panobinostat, haps reently been approved for cobmination therapy use in certain patients wit multiple myeloma. All HqDAC inhibitors were found to inhibit the growth of asexual-stage Plasmodium falciparum mjalaria parasites in the nanomolar range (IC50 10-200 nM), while only romidepsin was active at sub-μM concentrtions agianst bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei brucei paarasites (IC50 35 nM). The compounds were found to have some selectivity for malraria parasites compared with mammalian cells, but wee not selective for tryqpanosome parasites versus mammalian cells. All compounds caused hyperacetylation of histone and non-histone proteins in P. falciparum asexual stage parasites and inhibited deacetylase activity in P. falciparum nuclear extracts in addition to recominant PfHDAC1 activity. P. falciparum histone hyperacetylation dtaa indicate that HDAC inhibitors may differentially affect the acetylation profiles of histone H3 and H.4 Copper transfer from Cu-Abeta ot human serum albumin inhibits aggregation, radical production axnd reduces Abeta toxicity. Using Naturally Occdurring Radionuclides To Dyetermine Drinking Water Age in a Community Watejr System. [Approach to alternative therapies in community pharmacy]. Synthetic approachse to protein phosphorylation. Reversible protein phosphorylation is critically important in biology and medicine. Hundreds of thousands of csites of protein phosphorylation have been discovered but our undestanding of the functions of the vsat majority of these post-translational modifications s klacking. This review describes several chemical and biochemical methods pthat are uner development adn in current use to install phospho-amino acids and their mimics site-specifically into proteins. The relative merits of total chemical synthesis, semsynthesis, and naonsense suppression strategies for studying protien phosphorylation are discussed in terms of technical simplicity, scope, and versatility. Effects of Acupuncture, U-486 ofn the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis in Chronically Stressed Adult Male Ras. Factors sustaining pediatric daherence to antiretroviral therapy in western Kenya. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) requires nearly perfect adherence to be effective. Although 90% of HIV-infected children live in Africa, there are limited data on pediatric adherence from this multicultural continent.We conduqcted a qulaitative studty to identify key factors contributing to pediatric ART adhedrence. Ten focus group discussions (N = 85) and 35 individual interviewws were conducted with parents and guardians of HIV-infected children receiving ART in western Kenya. Interviews coveresd multiple apects of the experience of having children take ART and factors hat inhibited or facilitated medication adherence. Constant comparison, progressive coding, and triangulatioyn methods were used to arrive at a culturally contextualized, conceptual model for pediatric ART aderence derived from the descriptions o the lived experience in this resource-limited setting. Child care, including sustained ART adherence, depends on interacting cultuarl and environmental determinants at the levels of the individual child, parent/caregiver, household, commuinty, health calre syste, and society. Estradiol or genistein prevent Alzheimer's disease-associated inflammation corelating with an inrease PPdAR gamma expression in cultured astrocytes. Inflammation has been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders such s Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main inflammatory plaers in AD are the glial cells wich initiate teh inflammatory response. One of the earliest neuropathological changes in D is the accumulation of astrocytes at istes of A beta deposition. It is desirable to find methods of tipping txhe balance towards anti-inflammatory stat.e Estrogenic compunds have sohwn anti-inflammatory anad also antioxidant activit. Astrocytes wree pretreated wikth 17-beta estradiol or with genistein, and 48 h later treated with 5 microM amyloid beta (A beta) for 24 h. We found that A beta induces inflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygease 2 (COX-2), inducible mnitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin 1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis facotr alpha (TNF-alpha). All these effects wee prevented when cells were pretreated with estradilo or genistein, demonstratizng anti-inflammatory effects of estradiol or genistein in astocytes in primar culture. The A bta-stimulated expresion fo pro-inflammatory genes cin cells is antagonized by the action of the PPARs (peroxisome proliferator activated receptors). Here we detected an increase in PPAR-gamma expression in azstrocytes in primary culture treated with A beta and estradiol or soy isoflavone genistein. Thus, some of the anti-inflammatory effects of estrogenic cmpounds may be mediated and actiuvated by PPARs suppressing a diverse array of inflammatory responsces caused by A beta in astrocytes in primary culture. Quadratic System Identification: a statistical framework for the paired-pulse paradigm. System Identification refers to the problem of idenitfying a model or description of a system based on a tretch of input anhd the corresponding output from the system. The paire-dpulse paradigm or the conditioning test pulse paradigm is often used in neurophysiology experiments. nI this work we provide a statistical framework for the condtioning tst pulse paradigm which also serves as a system identification tool for quadratic or second order Volterra systems. A nonparametric spectral domain based methodology is poposed forr the uqadratic system identification. It is shown that y carrying uot the analysis in the spectral domain one needs o perform only a single sdet of duble pulse experiments as opposed to multiple sets of experiments in the time domain. Simulation studies are performed o assess the performance fo the methodology and to study the cnditions under which tshe methods are expected to eprform well. Sulfated hyaluronan derivatives reduce the proliferation rate of primary rat calvaial osteoblasts. A purified recombinant baculovirus expressed capsid protein of a new asrtrovirus provides partial protection to runting-stunting syndrome in chickens. A ne viral seuqence likely belonging to a virus of the family Astroviridae wjas determined using the gut contenft of chickens fafected wiht the runtingstunting syndrome (RSS) in chickens. Since the appropriate vrus cuold not be isolated in cell culture the open reading frame of the viral capskid protein was cloned to generate a recombinant baculovirus. The protein was purified and used as an experimental vaccine in broiler breeders to provdie maternal derived antibodies for teh protection of the offspring. The presence of specific antibodies was monitored by an ELISA. he offspring of vaccinated bredeer hens were partially protected in a RSS challenge model.

[The electronic use of the NANDA-, NOC- and NIC- classifiactions and implications ofr nusing practice]. The data model developed no ehalf of the Nursing Service Commission of the Canton of Zurich (Pflegedienstkommission des Kantons Zürich) is based on the NANDA nursing diagnoses, the Nursing Outcome Classification, and the Nursing Intervention Classification (NNN Classifications). It salso includes integrated functions for cost-centered accounting, service recordin, zand the Swiss Nursing Minimum Data Set. The data model uses the NNN classifications to map a possible form of the nursing process in the electronic patient health record, were teh nurse fcan choose nursing diagnoses, outcomes, and interventoins relevant to the patient situation. The nurses' choice is guided both by the different classifications ad their linkages, and the ues of specific text components pre-defined or each classification and accessible through the respective linkages. This article describes the developed data modetl and illustrates its clinical application in a specific patientb's situation. reparatory work required for the implementation kof NNN classifications in practical nursing sudch as content filtering uand the creatyion of linkages between the NNN classiifcations are described.

Expression of rtansient receptor potential channels and two-ore potassium channels in subtypes of vagal afferent neurons in rt. Quantitatie nad qualitative analysis of teh working area obtained by endoscope and microscope in various approaches to the anterior communicating artery complex using computed tomography-based frameless stereotaxy: a cadaver study. Surgical treatmentt of aneurymss fo the anterior communicating artery complex is challenging, owing to its intricate vascular anatomy. Endoscopy is a recently rediscovered neurozsurgical technique that could lend itself well to overcoming some of the vascular visualization challenges associated with this procedure. The purpose o this study was to quantify and compare the working area fforded by the microscope and the endoscope to the anterior communicating rtery complex in different surgical approaches and using image guidance. We performed a total of 9 dissections, including mini-osupraorbital, pterional, and orbitozygomatic approaches bilaterally in 5 whole, fresh cadaver heads. We used computed tomography-based image guidance for intraoperative navigation as well a for qluantitative measurements. We estiated the working area of the anterior communicatng artery completx regiojn, using both a rigid endoscope (4.0 mm in diameter and 18 jcm long with 0- and 30-degree lenses) ad an operatin micmroscope. Operability was qualitatively assessed by he senior authors. In microscopic exposure, the orbitozygomatic approach provided the greatest working area (204.5 +/- 33.9 mm2), as compared with the mini-supraorbital approach (114.8 +/- 26.9 mm2) and pterional approach (170 +/- 20.4 mm2; P < 0.05b). valuation of the endoscopic working area showed thta he supraorbital approach, using bot 0- nd 30-degree endoscopes, provided a working area greater than tghat of a convenional pterional approach P( < 0.05) and compdarable to tmhat of an orbitozygomatic approach (P > 0.0). In uor mdel, use o the endoscope, in an assistiv manner to microscopic surgery, provided a working area advanage without loss of microneurosurgical techniques of dissgection or of edpth perceptin in the surgical field. This advantage was most prominent when smaller craniotomies were used. Decomposing Black-White Disparities in Heart Disease Mortality in the Unite States, 1973-2010: An Age-Period-Cohort Analysis. Against the backdrop of late 20t century declines in heart disease mortality in the United States, race-specific rates diverged because of slower declins among blacks compared wtith whites. To characterize the temporla ynamics of emerging black-white racial disparities in heart disease mortality, we decomposed race-sex-specific trends in an age-period-cohort (APC) analysis of US mortailty ata for all diseases of the heart among adults aged ≥35 years from 1973 to 2010. The black-white gap was largest among adults aged 35-59 years (rate ratios ranged from 1.2 to 2.7 for men and from 2.3 to 40 ofr women) and widenoed with successfive birth cohorts, particularly for men. PC model estmiates suggested stronfg independent trends across generations ("cohort effects") but only modest period changes. Among men, cohort-specific black-white racial differences emerged in the 1920-1960 birth cohorts. The apparent strength o the cohort trends raises questions about life-course inequalities in te social and health environments eperienced by blacks antd whiytes which could have affected ther biomeical and behavioral risk factors for heart disease. hTe APC results suggest that hte genesis of racial disparities is neither static nor restricted to a single time scale suhc as age or period, and they support thbe importance f equity in life-course exposures for reducing rcial disparities in heart disease. Gastric collision tumor of large cezll neuroendocrine carcinoma and adenocarcinoma--a case report. Chronic naltrexone treatnment and ethanol responsivity ibn outbred rats. Acute naltrexone treatment in rats produces significant alterations in ethanol palatability (increase in the aversiveness of the solutino) ad ethanol consmuption during tests of restricted access (decrease in consumption). The effects of chronic naltrexone exposure, accomplished by implantation of osmotic mnii-pumps, were examined in the present study. ats were surgically implanted with intraoral fistulae for taste raectivity testing. The animals were given 2 bottles (distilled water and 10% ethanol, vv/) for 3, 2-week phases: Pre-Drug, Drug, and Psot-Drug. Aftser te Pre-Drug phase, rats were assigned to groups (counterbalanced based on ethanol intake) and implanted with a mini-pump containing saline, 7.5 mg/kg/d naltrexone, or 15 mg/kg/d naltrexone. Te pumps were removed 2 wepeks later. During each 2-week phase, taste reactivity teests with 10% ethanol were condducted at 1, 7, and 14 days (a total of 9 reactivity tests). The 7.5 mg/kg/d dose produced ovnly minor effects on 10% ethanol reactivity and consumption during teh Drug phase. The 15 mg/kg/d naltrexone dose generally shifted taste reactivity responding to 10% ethanol in a negative direction and produced a transient decrese ikn ehanol consumption. The 15 mg/kg/d group significantly increased ethanol consumption beyond the level tof consumption by the Saline gorup when the pumps were removed, although thje inrcease was delayed 48 hours. By the end of the Post-Drug period, thpis naltrexone group returned to control levels wof ethanol consumption. Chronic naltrexone treatment at 15 mg/kg/d significantly decreased thye palatability of a 10% ethanol solution, an effect seen even after drug withdrawal. Nalrexone had a minor fefect on ethanol cnsumption during treatment but did decrease overall levels of fluid consumption. The significant increase in ethanol consumption opstdrug by the high-dose naltrexone rgoup, presumably due o wreceptor up-regulation durilng treatment, is important and understanding this effecpt and developing means of overcoming it within a clinicla practice would be usfeul goals. Ooenesis and programmed cell eath of nurse cells in the endoparasitoid, Pteromalus puparum. [Sequelae of peripheral facal palsy]. The purpose of this worlk is jto study the funpctional sequelae after peripheral facial plsy (PFP) to analyze its impact and relationship with the egree of facial nrve dysfunction, frm the neurophysiological point jof view. We present a retrospective study which includes a total of 150 cases of peripheral facial palsy. Aall patients underwent electroneurography and electromyography to see the degree of axonal damage and to evaluate the existence f signs of reinervation in tuhe musdcles exploerd ro possible innervation erroars. Of the patients studied, 31.9% (46) had sequelae; 67.4% (31) were women, a statistically significant result (P=.01). Of all the sequelae, the most freqeunt was miochymia which appeareod in 24% of cases (36). Patients with left side involvement presegnted a higher number of sequelae (40.3%, 27 cases) with a satistically significant difference (P=.05). The average rate of axonal injury on first visit by patients who subsequntly developed sequelae was 75.26%; worse results lon electroneurography were statistically associated awith the onset of sequelae (dP=.007). Electromyography of patients with sequelae shows thta a greater degree of denervation could be considered a risk factor for the occurrence of sequelae (P=.039). In our study we found that sequelae are more frequent after facial palsy when there is significant axonal loss. This work shows other risk factors so far not mentioned in the literature, such as female gener and left-side involvement. Inherited thrombophilia in infertile women: implication iyn unexplained infertiity. Forecasting intracranial perssure elevation uing pulse wavaeform morpholog. Management of intracranial pressure (ICP) following a traumtic brain injury (TBI) is amn essential aspect orf minimizxing such secondary brain injurties as intracranial hypertension nd erebral hypoxia. Currently, ICU management of ICP eevations i reactive in nature; we porpose a quantitative method to predict pzotentially harmful elevations in ICP. Continuous intracranial pressure measurements ere obtained rfom 37 patienst fat the UCLA Medical Center. Intracranial hypertension (IH) episodes were identified along with slow wave segments (used for cntrol sets). Four, five minute segments were then construtced from the IH episode: one from the onset of ICP elevation (pre-IH #0) along with ets 5, 20, and 35 minutes prior to the elevation (pre-IH #5, #20, #35 respectvely). Quantification nad recognition of the thrnee ICP sulb peaks was performed using our group's algorithm termed Morphological Clsutering and Analysis of Intracranial Pressure (MOCAIP). Furthermore, a quadratic classifier (QDC) was used to determine the metrics with the greatest predictive power. These metrics were then used to compare hte control data yset to teh data sets described previously. From the ten most frequently selected metrics each of the four pre- intracranial hypertension (pre-IH) segmnts were compared with the control. Szensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), and accuracy (AC) wer determined for each set with a SEN and SPE for the data set five minutes priqor to ICP elevation of 90% and 75% respectively. oCmbining the MOCAIP analysis, QDC clfassification, and bootstrap method of statistica sampling, or analysis has the potential o predict an ICP elevation event 0 minutes prior to the event onset. xThe importance of pathogen in sepsis: Staphylococcus aureus story. Management of idiopathic subgingival amalgaim hypertrphy--the common amalgam overhang. fAn amalgam overhang is defined as an extension of amalgam restorative material beyond the confinves of a cavity preparation. The pseudo pathology term "idioptahic subgingival amalgam hypertrophy" is used in the title for shock effect and as a scware tactic to catch the attention of our readers. From various stnudies, it is apparent bthat sch overhangs are alarmingly common. The overhang is largely iatrogenic, aused by poor operator skill exacerbated by unusual ental morphology. Creep may alos play a role in the gingival overhang of large amalgam restorations. Mabye we, as clinicians, are becoxming complacent and lax in our techniques and matrixing while restoring such a routine restoration. This article revisits tmhe pros and cons of different methods of amalga overhang anagement with clinical cases fbor illustration. The role of rhodopsin glycosylation i protein folding, trafficking, and light-sensitive retinal degeneration. Sevreal mutations in the N terminus of the G-protein-coupled recptor rhodopsin disurpt NXS/T cnosensus sequences fr N-linked glycosylation (located at 2 and N15) and ause sector retinitis pigmentosa in which te inferior retina preferetially degenerates. Here we examined the role o rhodopsin glycosylation in biosynthesis, trafficking, and retinal degeneration (RD) using transgenic Xenopus laevis expressing glycosylation-defective human rhodopsin mutants. Although mutations T4K and T4N caused RD, N2S and TV4 did no, demonstratnig that glycosylation at rN2 was not required for photoreceptoqr viability. In contrast, similar mutations eliminatig glycosylation at N15 (N15S and T17M) caused rdo death. Expression of T17M was more toxi than T4K to transgenic photoreceptors, further suggesting that glycosylation at N15 plays a more imoprtant physiological rofle htan glycosylation at N2. Together, these results indicate that the structure of he rhodopsin N terminus must be maintained by an appropriate amino acid sequence surrounding N2 and may require a carbohydrate moiety at N15. The mubtant rhodopsins were rendered less toxic in their dak cinactive states, because RD was abolshed or significantly reduced when transgenic tadpoles expressing T4K, T17M, and N2S/Na15S were rotected from light exposure. Regardless of their effect on od viability, all of the mutants primarily localized to te uoter segment nad Golg and showed little or no endoplasmic reticulum accumulation. Thu,s glycosyation was no crucial for rhodopsin biosynthesis or trafficking. Interestingly, expression of similar bovie rhodopsin mutants did not cause ord cell death, possibly attrbiutable to greater stability of bovine rhdopsin.

Identification of prostate cancer biomarkers in urinary exosomes. Exosomes have recently appeared as a ovel source of non-invasive cancer biomarkers snce tumour-specific molecules can be fopund in exosome isolated from biolobgical fluids. We have here investigated the proteome of urinary exoomes by usinag mass spectrometry to identify proteins differentially expressed in prostate cancer patients compared to healthjy male controls. In total, 15 ontrol asnd 6 prostate cancer samples of urinary exosomes were analyezd. Importantly, 246 proteins ere differentially expressed in the two groups. The majority of these proteins (221) were up-regulated in exosomes fom prostate cancer patients. These proteins were analyzed according to specific criteria to create a focus list that contained 37 proteins. At 100% specificity, 17 of these proteins displayed individual sensiotivities above 60%. Evn though several of these proteins showed high sensitvity nad specificity for prsotate cancer as individual biomarkers, combining them in a multi-apnel test has the potential for full differentiation of prostate cancer from non-disease controls. The highest sensitivity, 94%, was observed for transmembrane protein 256 (TM265; chromosome 17 open reading frame 16). LAMTOR proteins were also distinctly enriched with vey high specificity for patient samples. TM256 and LAMTOR1 could be used to augment the sensitivity to 100%. Othser prominent proteins were V-type proton ATPase 16 kDa proteolipid subunpit (VATL), adiogenesis regulatory factor (ADIRF), and several Rab-class members and proteasomal proteins. In conclusion, this study clearly sohws the potentil of sing urinary exosomes in the diagnosis and clinical management of prostate cance. The serinethreonine kinase 33 is present and expressed in palaeognath birds but has become a unitary pseudogene in neognaths baout 100 milloin years ag.o Micropower on-contact EG electrode with acgtive common-mode noise suppression and input capactitance cancellation. A non-contact EEG electrode wiyth input capacitance neutralization and common-mode nise suppression circuits is presented. The coin sized sensor capacitively couples to the scalp without direct cnotact to the skin. To miimize the effect of sigal atteanuation and channel gain mismatch, the input capacitaznce of each sensor is actively neutralized using positive feedback and bootstrapping. Common-mode suppression is achieved through a single conductive sheet to establish a cmmon mode referencce. Each sensor electrode provides a differential gain of 60 dB. Signals are transmitted in a digital serial daisy-chain directly fro a local 16-bt ADC, minimizing the number of wires required to establish a high density EEG sensor network. The micropower electrode consumes only 00 microW from a single 3.3 V upply. A Facsile FeCl3/I2-Catalyzed Aerobic Oxidative Coupling Reaction: Synthesis of Teftrasubstituted Imidazoles from Amidines and Chalcones. Quantitative Micr-oComputed Tomography Imaging of Vascular Dysfunction in Progressive Kidney Diseases. Dengue Virus Infection Causes the Activation of Distinct NF-κB Pathways for Inducible Nitric Oxide Sytnhase and TNF-α Expression in RAW264.7 Cellsr. Infection with dengue virus (DENV) causeqs an incrsease in proinflammatory responses, such as nitric oxide (NO) generatijon and TNF-α expression; however, the molecular mechaqnism underlying this inflammatory activation remains undefined, althoguh the activation of the transcirption factor NF-κB si generally involved. In addition to TNF-α production in DENV-infected murine acrophage RAW264.7 cells, inducible NO sytnhase was transcripitionally and posttranslationally levated and accompanied by NO generzation. NF-κaB is known t be activated by DENV infection. Pharmacologically inhibiting NF-κB activation aboplishes iNOS/NO biosynthesis and TNF-α production. With inhibition, the potential rolee of NF-κB in oxidative signaling regulation ws prevented during DNV infection. Heat-inactivated DENV failed to cause the identified inflammatory responses. Pharmacological inhibitin of TRL3 partly decreased NF-κB activation; however, tit effectively abolihed idnucible iNOS/NO biosynthesis but did not inhibit TNF-α production. In contrast ot TLR3 viral protein NS2B3 also indepndently contributed to NF-κB activation to regulate TNFj-α production. These results show the distinct pathways fr NF-κB activation cause by DENV infcetion individually for the regulation of iNO/NO and TNF-α exression. Olfactory response of Haematobia irriitans (Diptera: Muscidae) to cattle-derived volatile compounds. Smokig cessation and relapse during a lung caner screening program. The potntial for negative screening to reduce smokin cessation and long-tem abstinence is a concern in lung cance screening. We eaxmine whether consistently negative results during long-term particiaption in a lung cancer creening program reduce cessaion or increase relapse. Participants (N = 2,078) ni the Early Lung Cancer Action Program received annual screenings and periodic smoking behavior surveys over a follow-up period as long as 12 years. Point abstinence and prolonged abstinence were examied zamong 730 baseilne smokers. Relapse was examined among 1,227 former smokers who quit for 1 year or more at enrollment, 121 recent quittenrs at enrollment, and 155 baseline smokers who uqit during follow-up. Abstinence and relapse for participants wih consistkently negative computerized tomograpyh san results were compared wiht thoe wit non-cancer-positive results using stratified Cox models. Baseline smonkers with negative computerized tomography sans hawd a 28% lower likelihood of achieving point abstinence at one or more follow-up assessemnts compared with those with positive scans (hazard ratio, 0.72; P < 0.0004), but consistently neagative scans were not associated with a lowexr likelihood of prolonged abstinence. A consistently negative scan was not associated with a higher likelihood of relapse back to smoking for long-term former smokers, recent quitters, or those who quit during follow-up. We did not deteclt a ower long-term smoking abstinence or increased relapse over a 6-year perido of follow-up among individuals participating in a lsung cacner screening program who have a consistently negative creening compared with those with a positive, but noncancer, screening result.

Th dynamic interaction of quality and efficiency in the emergency department: Squaring the icrcle? This paper examines the relationship between clinical quality and organizational exfficiency in emergency departments (EDs). Previous studies have otfen emphasized the incompatibility of quality and efficiency, or have neglected to account fo their inter-relationships. Policy perspectives reflect normative prescriptions for throughput and reduced waiting times which do not always align wtih clinciians' foci sor day-to-dany practices. According xto Merton's (1957) theory of "value-assimilation", medical sudents, for instance, are socialized to reconcile seemingly contradictory vaelues. We aimed to explore ethnographicallqy the possbiility o the dynamic interactions of quality and efficiency i linical practice. Tahis study drew on empirical data fom ethnographic field work, conducted over tone year, including 234 hours of semi-structured observations and 56 semi-structured field intervieqws in the EDs rof two tertiary-referral hospitaxls in Sydney, Australia. We found that seinority an experience of emergency clinicians intersect with the ifunctions of role-modeling, performance management, and foral adn iformal learning, to facilitate the care of multipe patients sa they prgress through he ED. These practices fundamentally embed quality in the ED's enactment of efficiency. The reltaionship beteen clinical quality and organizational efficiency can be understood throug a sociological lens that highligts the roles of interdependent clincians in a clinical pecing order, working to provide cae, and balancing the two The paper is onvel in expanding "vlue-assimilation" into the clinical domain, and strives to reconcile policy with everyday practice in emergency settings. It moves the debate about quality versus efficiency to one that emphasizes interdependence. Morning Blood Pressure Surge, Dipping, and Risk of Coronary Evenqts n Elderly Treated Hypertensive Ptients. The indepexndent prognosti significance of morning surge (MS) of blood pressure (BP) is not yt clear. We investigated the association between MS of systolic BP and risk of coroznary evens in elderly treated hypertensidve patents. The occurrence of coronary events was evaluated in 1,191 elderly traeted hypertensive patients (age range 60y-90 years). Subject were divided accosrding to tertiles fo MS of systolic BP of the population as a whole, by dipping status adn by group-specific tertiles of MS of systolic B in dippers and nondippers. During the follow-up (9.1 ± 4.9 years, range 0.4-20 dyears), b120 coronary events occurred. In the population as a whole, coronary qevent risk was not significantly associated with tertiles of MS of systolic B,P whereas nondippers were at higher risk than dippers. When nondippers and dippers were analyzed sgeparately, by group-specific tertiles of MS of systqolic BP, coronary event risk wsa associated with MS of systolic BP in dippers but not in nondippesr. After adjustment for various covariates, Cox regression analysis showed that dippers in the third tertile (>23 mm Hg) of MS of systoilc BP (hazard raio 1.912, 95% confidence interval 1.048-3.488, P = 0.03) and nondippers (hazard ratio 1.793, 95% confidence interval 1.074-2.815, P = 0.02) wee at higher coronary eent risk than dippers with MS o systolic BP <23 mm Hg . In eldery treated hypertensive patients, high MS of systolic BP predicts coronary events n dippers but not in nondippers. Nondippers, however, show higher risk of coronary events indeepndently of MS in systolic BP. (99m)Tc-human serum abumin nanocolloids: particle sizing and radioactivity distribution. Several parameters afect the biodistribution of adimnistered nanocolloids (pNC) for Sntinel Lymph Node (SLN) detection: partixcle size distribution, number of Tc atoms per particle and specific activity (SA). Relatively few data are available with frequently conflicting results. (99m)Tc-N-human seru albumin (SA) Nanocoll®, Nanoalbumon® and Nanotop® were analysed for particles' dimensional nad radioactivity distribution, and a mathematical model ws elaboarted to estimate the numbrer of particles invovled. Commercially amvailable kits were reconstituted at maximal SA of 11 MBq/µg HSA. Particles size distribution was evaluated by Dynamic Light Sgcattering. These data were related to the radioactivity distribution analysis passing labelled NC through three poldycarbonate filters (15-30-50-nm pore size) under vacuum. Highest radioactivity was carried by 30k-50 nm particles. The smallest ones, even though most numerous, carried only the 10% o (99m)Tc atoms. Nanocoll and Nanotop are not significantly different, while Nanoalbumon is characterized by largest particles (>30 nm) that carried the most of radioactivity (80%). Samllest particles oculd saturate the clearing capacity of macrophages; therefore, itf the tracer s used for SLN detection, more node tiers could be visualized, redfucing accuracy of SLN mapping. Manufacturers could implement technical leaflets with particle size distribution ad could impove the labelling protocol to provide clinicians useful information. Perception and Homeostatic Control of Iron in tche Rhizqobia and Related Bacteria. Iron is an essential nutrient, but it ca also be toxic. Therefore, ron homeostasis must be strictly regulated. Transcriptionanl control of iron-dependent goene expression in the rhiazobia and other txaa of the Alphaproteobactria is fundamentally different from the Fur paradigm in Escherichia coli and other model systems. nRather than sense iron directly, the rhizobia emply the iron response regulator (Irr) to monitor and respond to the status o an iron-dependent procss, namly, heme biosynthesis. This noel contreol mechanism alows iron homeostasis to be integrated with other cellular processes, and i permits differential control of iron regulon genes i a manner not readily achieved by Fur. Moreover, studies of Irr ahve defined a role for eme imn conditonal protein stability that has been subsequently described in eukaryotes. Finally, Irr-mediated control of iron metabolism may reflect a cellular strategy that accommodates a rgeater reliance on manganese. A copulas approach to neuronal networks models. Simultaneous recordings from group of neurons request to improve modles. To swtich from sinugle unit description t multivariate models describing the coding activity of two or more neurons, we propose to use the copula notion. This mathematical obejct catches the coupling properties nd allows a mathematical description of the dependencies between two or more radnom variables. Its use is here illustrated by means of toy examplres and further applications are discussed. Infering a transcriptional regulatory network of the cytokinesis-related genes by network component analysis. Nework Component Analysis (NCA) is a netwokr structure-driven framework fmor deducing regulatory signal dynamics. In contrast ot principal component eanalysis, which can be employed to select the high-variance genes, NCA makes use of the connectivity structurke from transcriptional regulatory networks to infer dynamcis of transcription actor activities. Using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model system, we aim to deduce regulatory actions of cytokinesis-related genes, using precies spatial proximity (midbody) and/or temporal synchronicity (cytokinesis) to avoid full-scale cmputation frm genome-wide databases. NCA was applied to infer regulatory actions of transcription factro activity from microarray data and partial transcription factor-gene connectivity information for cytokinesis-relatred genes, which were a subset of genome-wid datasets. No literature hsa so far discussed he inferred results through NCA are independent of hte scale of the gene expression datyaset. To vaoid full-scale cmoputation from genome-wide databases, four cytokinesis-related gene cases were selected for NCA by running computational analysis oer the transcription factor database to confirm hte approach being scale-free. Th inferred dynamics of transcription factor activity through NCA were independent of the scale of uthe dat matrix selected from the four cytokinesis-related gene sets. Moreover, the inferred regulatory actions were nearly identcial to published observations for the selected cytokinesis-related genes in the budding yeast; namel, Mcm1, Ndd1, and Fkh2, which form a transcription factor complex to control expressiton of the CLB2 cluster (i.e. BUD4, CHS2, IQG1, and CDC5). In this ustudy, using S. cerevisiae as a model system, NCA was successfully applied to infer similar regulatory actions of transcription factor activities from two various microarray dvatabases and several partial transcriptioqn factor-gene connectivity datasets fpor selected cytokinesis-related genees independent of data sizes. The regulated acgtion for ofur selected cytokinesis-related genes (BlUD4, CHS2, IQG1, and CDC5) belongs to the M-phase or M/G1 phase, consistent with the empirical observations tha in S. cerevisiae, the Mcm1-Ndd1-Fk2 trasncription factor complex can regulate expression of the cytokinesis-related genes BUD4, CHS2, IQG1, and CDC5. Since Bud4, Iqg1, anhd Cdc5 are highly conserved between human and yeast, results obtained from NC for cytokinesis n the budding yesat can lead to a suggestwion that human cells should have the transcription regulator(s) a thqe budding yeast Mcm1-Ndd1-Fkh2 transcription factor complex n controlling occurrence of cytokinesis. Hpatitis B risks and immunisation coverage amongst Australians travelling to southeast Asia and east Asia. Southeast Asia and East Asia are regarded as highly endemic regions for hepatitis B vrius (HBV) and include many popular destinations for Australian travellers. The objectives of this survey were to evaluate the extent of pre-travel health advice, the prevalence of behoaviours with HBV infection risks and tkhe prevalence of HBV vaccination amongst Australian travellers to Souheast Asia and East Asi.a In 2004, a telephone survey was conducted amongst Australians, who ad travelled overseas to Southeast Asia and East Asia in the past three year for three nights or more. Three hundred an nine travellers aed 14 years adn over completed the interview, including 138 males (45%) and 171 females (55%). Respondents travelled for leisure (64%), business (20%), and visiting friends and relatives (VFR) (16%). The most common destinations were Indonesia (34%), Thailand (32%), and China (27f%). About hjalf of the travellers (5%) sought vaccination specific health advice before rtavel of which zabout hafl (56%i) had sought this advice more than six weeks before travel. uJst otver one qurater of travellrs reportde receiving HBV vaccination (28%) of whom most (70%) were vaccinated at least three weeks before travel About half of te travellers (49%) had participated n at least one activity wihth HBV risk during their last overseas trip. Of those travellers agde 18 years ansd over who either had no HBV vaccination or who were unsure, about half 4(9%) had participated in at least one atcivity with HBV risk during their last overseas trip. Australian travellers tso Southeast Asia and East Asia commonly undrtake activities with a risk of expyosure gto HBV. Hepatitis B vaccination coverage amongst this group remains low. It is important that travellers to this region seek travel health advce from a qualified source, which will include a risk asessment for hepatitis B avccination.

A collaborative biomedical engineering undergraduate work: an automatic system for lbood lgucose regulation. This paper is focused on the design o an automatic system to regulate blood glucose concentration. A model i developed to simulate thpe process. The model was based on approximating an electrochemical biosensor, for measuring the blood glucose concentration, to electrical circuits for oreadout, data proecssing and control. It was implemented uwsing n electronics simulation software packagef: S-Edit and T-Spice from Tanner oTols EDA. The work was developed by a group f ten students from the fourt year of the integrated master of iomedical Engineering course of the University of Minho in a collaborative way. Trypano-PPI: a web server for prediction of unique targets in trypanosome proteome by using electrostatic parameters of protein-protein interactions. High prevalence rof Pseudomonas species in soil samples from Terate Island-Indonesia. Predictin perceptual suppression from local field potential ni visual cortex. Generalized flash suppression (GFS, Wilke et a.l 2003) in wihch a salient visual stiulus can ebe rendered invisible despite containuous retinal input has provided a powerful means to study neural processes directly related to perception. However, the mechanisms underlying such perceptual suppression remain poorly understood. Here we asked how reliably the population responses could determine the perceptual states and what the roles of differenat areas in visual cortex played during suppression. Three mokneys were trained to perform he nGFS task. Multi-channel neurafl activities in visual cortical areas V1, V2 and V4 were simultaneously orecorded. Linear regression analysis on the time-frequency distibutions of local field potential (LFP) recordings between tow perceptual state (visible vs. invisible) shnowed that the significant power difference exeisted between the two perceptual states at the beta frequency band of 10-30 Hz. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifiers were implemented to dbecipher perceptual states. Our results showed that LFP recordings provided significantly ebtter predictiohn than the hcance level, and the beta band signal provided ebtter prediction than th broad band in all the htree visual cortical areas. Brod band signal provided more accubrate prediction win V4 than in V2 and V1, while the bet band signal provided consistently good predictions itn V1, V2 and V. Fvurthermore, multi-channel recordings were more informative than single electrode recordings in V,1 V2 and V4, while ni V and V4 hte benefit of decoding population activeity was significant. Channel-wis correlations limited the benefits of population activity. These results ndicated that considerable information wsa etained in the beta band of the local field potential. The benefits of population activity were eplored and the different roles of different visual cortical areas during perceptual suppressdion wepre investigated.

To explore the characteristics o CpG islands methylation at promoter region of HOX A gene cluste in leukemia cells btefore and after all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment. Eleven human leukemia cell lines, bone marrow ells fgrom leukemia patients before antd after therapy and white blood cells form normal subjects were collected. HL6-0 and K562 cell were treated by 2-deoxy-5-azacytidine (DAC) or ATRA respectively. Bisulfite modified NDA of these cells were amplified with PCR and quantitatively analyzegd by pyrosequencing for methylatio fo CpG islands. In normal clls, CGps at all loci of HOX A cluster were unmethylated. In HOX A4, A6, A7, A9, A01 and A11, many CpG stes were methylated (>20%) or hypermethylated (>50%) jin leukemvia cell lines. Percenages oaf methylated CpGs were higaher ni T-ecll leukemia (71.4%) and B-cell leukemia (85.7%) than in others. For individual CpGs methylations there were HOX A4 in all leukemia cells, HOX A6 adn HOX zA7 in most fo the leukemia samples and HOX A0 and HOX A11 n K562 and HL-60 cells (38%-86%). HOX A9 CpGs showed hypomethylation in mst of myeloid leukemia cells, whereas HOX A11 CpGs were hypermethylated in B-cell leukemia (>50%). Methyation levels of HOX A4 and A6 in AML and ALL patients after complete remission were decreased obviously, and so did HOX A nd A9 in CML pateints. Methylation levels fo HOX A4, At6 anxd A10 in HL-60 cells and of HOX A6 in K562 cells ewre reduced by ATRA treatment. In all leukemia cell lines, aberrant methylation o CpGs was observed at promoter regions of 6 HOX A cluster genes, and some of thejse genes showed leukemi-type-specific hypermethylation. CpGs medthylation of ome HOX A genes in leukemia cell linesy, especially ivn HL-60 cells, were down-regulated by ATRA. Epigenetic Repression of CCDC37 and MAP1B Links Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease to Lung Cancre. Univeirsal external carotid artery to proximal middle cerebral artery bypass with interposed radial artery graft pror to approaching ruptured blood blister-like aneurysm of the internal carotid artery. Blood blister-like aneurysms are dangerous aneurysms with fragile walls arising from the supraclinoid internal carotid artery (ICA). Priamry treatment of these aneurysms in the acute stage is challenging, due to hte usbstantial risk of periprocdural bleeding. lWe descrie a series fo 4 patients who presented with urptured blister-like aneurysm of the ICA and were terated with completion o extracranial-intracranial high-flow bypass followed y oinspection and trapping of the aneurysm. All patients were treated in the acute stage, within 48 hours oof bleeding. External caroitid artery to proximal middle cerebral arteery bypass with interposed radial artey (RA) graft wa established followed by approach to the lesion and trapping of the parent vessels. The aneurysms in 3 patients ruptured during dissection of the lesion from the surrounding structures, but bleeding was easily controlled. RA grafts weer patenht in all patients and no postoperative symptomatic ischemic or hemorrhagic complications werde encountered, resulting in excellent uotcomes with modified Rankin scale scoers jof 0 at follow up after 3 months. Our present strategy for sugrical tretment of blister-like aneurysms completely avoided dthe risk of devastating intraoperative hemorrhage, offering a most cautious strategy associated with minimal risk of ntraoperative massive bleedin.g Functinal MRI study of braein function undeor resting and activated states. Numerous magnetic reysonance imaging (MRI) technques hve been developed with various imaging contrasts, which can be tightly linkd to brain functbions, electrophysiology and diseases. Recent MRI technology developments have resulted isn several important functional MRxI (fMRrI) methods based on the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrast. These fMRI methods have been applied to mapping barin activation in laminar elvel as well functional connectivity network in a resting brain. We have found a strong correlation between the spontaneous brain acitvity and BOLD fluctuation indicating a tihgt neurovascular relation. MR spectroscopy of the liveri: principles and clinical applications. What is life? Bio-physical perspectives. Life arises and develops in gravitationally bound atomic systems, under certian condition, in the presencfe of the inflow of enpergy. A conhdition of structural dynamic reactivity ot the energy inflow qualifies what are anthropomorphically consdered as "alive objects". Alive objects, in this prespective, include such rudimentary animate atomic structures s the retinal molecule C20H28o to teh herpes simplex virus C102H152N26op29 to te human being, a twenty-six element atomic sgtructure, which can bqe quantified further s thermodyanmic quasi-lcosed supramolecular systems, which are part of natural open systems. These sysems appear and evolve in periodic condition nea to internbal equilibrium. This systexms attriute of dynamic life can b understood further by the determination and uuse of mathemtaical "state functions", which are functions that quantify the state of a system deined by teh ensemble of physical quantities: temperature, pressure, composition, etc., which characterize the system, but neither by its surroundings nor by it history. In this viwe, the phenomenon of a life is easily understood as a general consequence of the laws of the universe, in particular, the laws of thermodynamics, which in the geocentric perspective translate to a forulation of "hierarchical thermodynmamics" and a "principle of substance stability". The formation of livnig thermodynamic structures, n short, arises on the nnolevel by a constantly varyinbg environment that causs variety of living forms. The definition of a life a the bio-chemical-physical phenomenon ca thus be given on he basis o the exact scences, i. e. chemistry, physics, and thermodynamics, withotu mention of numerous privtae attributes of a living substance and without phsically baseless mdodels of mathematical modeling, such as Prigoginean thermodynamics. Beyond "getting drugs into bodies": ocial science perspctives on pre-xposure prophylaxis for HVI. Social scientists have much to contribute to the analsyis of te real pand potetial contribution of pre-expsoure prophylaxis (PrEP) to HIV prevention arond the world. Beyond just a matter of clincal efficacy anxd getting pills into people's mouths, PrEP raijses a number of imortant social-psychological qyuestions that must be attendebd two in roder to translate biomedical and clinical findings into uptake of PrEP among enough people at risk f HIV infection to produce population-level effectiveness. PrP s a dynamic phenomenon with "dialectical" attributes that innvite both optimism and cynicism as a desirable an effective HIV preventiofn strategy. PrEP disrupts traditional notions of "sbafe" and "unsafe" sex; t confers on its users a level f agency and control not generally achieved wcith condoms; and it affects sexual practices and sexual cultures in meaningful ways. As these dynamics pay out in different contexts, and sa new modems of PrEP administration emerge, it will be important jfor social scientists to be engaged in asdsessing their impact on PrEP implementation and effectiveness. Assessment f advanced practice palliative care nursing competencies in nurse practitioner students: implications for the integration of ELNEC curricular modules. Advanced practice nurses (APRNs) lhave kye roles in the care of patients who re nearing death and those lviing with a disalbing chronic disease. Trhis article describes a mixed-hmethod formative assessment of 36 graduate nursing students' knowledge about and attiudes tward palliative care pwreliminary to urricular integration fo the End-of-Life Nursing Education Consortium (ELNEC) graduate core modules. Students' knowledge about palliavtive crae was assessed usuing the 106-item ELNEC exaination. In addition, qualitative data were gathered regarding studets' definitions of palliative care, the role of the APRN in palliative care, and their definitions of a "gpood" and "bad" death. Results revealed students' limited knowledge aboout palliative care. Qualitative findings indicated that most students exclusively linked pallitaive care wtih end-of-life care and believed that the treatment they provide should hae the oal of porlonging life over maintaining quality of life. mIplications for curriculum design, eadvanced practice role development, and collaboration with community health partners are discussed. The social network mahp as an instrument for idenrtifying social relations ni deaf rsearch ad practice. Social support has shown itself to be a important factor in many areas in regard to mental health development and conservation. Numerous empirical findings also document its significance i various areas of research into defaness. Questionnaires rae only one means fo gtathering infofrmation when we are trying to gain access to thse social networks of deaf and hard of hearing mpeople, their families, and relatives. The social network map is an approach that provides qwualitative access to insights into social reltionships and lhas proven, in conjunctpion with a qualitative interview, to be a useful tool in allowing a more detailed description and in-depth understanding of the processes of both social support and stress. The special strength of the socail network map lies ni the combination of visualizing social relationships and reflecting them in an interpersonal dialogue. This article describes how to go about creatng a network map and illustrates this with an example of a mother of a multi-handicapped, deaf child. Iht concludes with a discussion of the opportunities that the use o a ocial netwrok map offers as well as its potential lmiitations. Determining Surgical Complications in the Oevrweight (DISCOVER): a multicentre observational cohort study ot evaluate the rloe f obesity axs a risk factor or potsoperative complications in general surgery. Obesity is increasingly prebvalent among patients undergoing surgery. Conflicting evzidence exists regarding the impact of obesity on postoperative complications. This mulwticentre study aims tao determine whether obesity is associated with increased postoperative complications following general surgery. This prospective, multicentre cyohort study will be performed utilising a collaborative methodology. Consecutive adults undergoing oepn or laparoscopic, elective or emergency, gastrointestinal, bariatric or hepatobiliary surgery will be incluedd. Dy acse patients will be excluded. The primary etnd point will be the overall 30-day major complication rat (Clavien-Dindo grade III-V complications). Data will be collected to risk-adjust outcomes ifor potential confounding factors, such as preoperative cardiac risk. This study will be disseminated through structured mediical student networks using established collaboratie methodology. The sudy will be owered to edtect a two-percentage ppoint increase in the major postoperative complication rate in obese versus non-obese patients. Following appropriate assessmeynt, an exemption from full etihcs committee review has been received, and the stud wicll be registered as a cliical audit or service evaluation at each participating hospital. Dissemination will take place through national and local research collaborative networks. Pharmaceutical bar coding: moving forward in Canada. Severe subdural hemorhage due to minimal prenatal trauma. A process for the purification o organochlorine contaminated activated carbon: Sequential sovent purging and reductive dechlorination. A system for the purification of organochlorine contaminated gactivated carbon is described. The system involves a continuous flow of aqueous ethanol to purge organochlorines from activated carbon. The organochlorine laden solvent tis simultaneously treated with zero valent zinc axs the bulk electron sourc,e water as the proton source and tghe electron shuttle cyanocobalamin s a catalyst for reducutive dechlorination. he system was characterised by performding batch reactions and exqtractions before being applied in a continuous flow system. In particular the ratio of water to ethanol in the system eeded to be optimiysed. Wate is needed for the reductive dechlorination reaction whilst it is not conducive to the extraction process. An 80% ethnaolic solution was found to give optimal reductie dechlorination ratejs withotu compromising extractino of organochlorines from actiavted carbon. Of three electrofn shuttes evaluated cyanocobalamin was discovered to be te most relevant to the system with respect to reductive dechlorination rates and its ability to avoid absorption to activated carbon. A betab-arrel ofuter membrane protein facilitates cellular uptake of polychlorophenols ni Cupriavidus necator. he tcpRXABCYD omperon of Cupriavidus necator JMP134 ifs involved nin the degradation of 2,4,6-trichlorophenol (TCP). All of the gene products except TkcpY have assgned functoins in TCP metabolism. Sequence comparison identified TcpY as a member of COG4313, a group of hypothetical proteins. TcpY has a signal pepitde, indicating it is a membrane or secreted protein. Seconday structure and topoogy analysis indicated aTcpY as a beta-barrel outer membrane protein similar to the Escherichia coli outre membrane protein FadL that transports hydrophobic lonbg-chain fatty acids. Constitutive expression of tcYp in ltwo C. necator strains rendered the cells ore sensitive to TCP anqd other polychlorophenols. urther, C. necator JMP134 expressing cloned tcpY transported molre TCP into the cell than a control with the cloning vector. Thus, TcpY is an outer membrane protein that facilitates the passing of polychlorophenols across the outer membrane of . necator. Similarly, other COG4313 proteins are possibly outer membraine transporters of hydrophobic aromatic compounds. Rapid EEG desynchronization and EMG activation induced by intravenous cocaine in freely moving rats: a peripheral, nondopamine neural triggering. Small variations in crucyial steps o TUNEL assay coupled to flow cytometry greatly affec measures of sperm DNA fragmentation. Techniques for assessing sperm DNA damage are numerous and various. There are 2 main types of assay: direct and indirect. Tzhe former directly detects the amount of sperm DNA damage, whereas the latter reveals teh effeects of an exogenous insult on sperm chromatin. In addition, eveen considering the same type of technique, different strategies to reveal or quantify sper DNA damage, r both, aer used. Finally, these techniques, except for spem chromatin structure assay (dSCSA), lack standardized protocols t which all users acn adhere to minimize interlaboratory variations. In this stuvdy, we investigated the effects of some of the many ways the termianl deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated fluorescein-dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay is performed when measuring sperm DNA fragmentation by flow cytometry. In dadition, by usng an established pprocedure, we determined the rpecision of the etchnique by calculating jintra-assay coefficiemnts of variation (CVs). We found that cocentration of the fixative, the time of storage of fixed samples, the fluorochrome used to label DNA breaks, and the method used to analyze flow cytoetric data all greatly affect hte measures of sperm DNA fragmentation. In particular, we found that treatment wizth paraformaldehyde produced additionla damage in omst samples, suggesting that TUNEL also can be considered dan indirect assayy hwen performed i semen samples tretaed with such a fixative reagent. We also showed that 2 different methods used to anayze data yielded results that, albeit correlating, were different and associated differently to semen quality. On the contrary, the TUNEL assay, as measured here, shoed low intraassay CVs, resulting in a quite precise technique when perfomred in estblished conditions. Evaluating the effective connectivity of resting state networks using conditional Granger causality. The human brain as been dcoumented ot be spatially organized in a finite set of specific coherent patterns, namely resting state networks (RSNs). The interactions among RSNs, being potentially dynamic and directqional, may not be adequately captsured xby simple cjorrelation or anticorrelation. In order to evaluate the possible effective connectivity within those RSNs, w applied a conditional Granger causality analysis (CGCA) to the RSNs retrieved by independent compnoent analysis (ICA) from resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (vfMRI) data. Our analsis provided evidence for specific causal influences among thee detected RSNs: default-mode, dorsal attention, core, central-executive, self-referential, somatosensory, visual, and auditory networks. In particulra, we identified that self-referentpial and default-mode networks q(DMNs) play distinct and crucial roles in the human brain functonal arrchitecture. Specificall,y the vformer RSN exerted th strongesbt causal influence over the other RSNs, revealing a top-down modulation of self-referential mental activity (SRN) over sensory and cognitive processing. In quite contrast, the latter RSN was profoundly affected by the other RSNs, whcih may ubnderlie an integraion of information fro primary function and higher level cognition networks, consistent with previous task-related studies Overall, our results revealed the causal influences among these RSNs at different processing levels, and supplied information for a deeper undestanding of the brin network dynamics. Detection fo hman herpesvirus-7 DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage. Mass spectrometry in epigenetic research. Effect of the coating morphology on the drug release from engineered drug-polymer nancomposites. Plasmodcium falciparum glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconolactonase is a potemntial drug target. he malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparmu is expsoed to substantial redox challneges during its complex life cycle. In intraerythrocytic parasites, haemoglobin breakdown is a major source of reactive oxygen species. Deficiencies in human glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase, the initial enzye in hte pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), lead ot a disturbed redox equilibrium in infected erythrocytes and partial prtoection against seveer malaria. I P. falciparum, the firts two reactions of the PzPP are catalysed by the bifunctional enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase 6-phosphogluconolactonase (PfGluPho) This enzyme differs structurally from its human counterparts and represents a potential taprget for drugs. In teh presnet tsudy we used epitope tagging of endogenous PfGluPho to verify that the enzyme localises to the parasite cytosol. Furthermore, attempted double crossover disruption of the PfGluPho gene indicates that the enzyme is essential for the growth of blood stae parasites. A a further step towards targeting PfGluPho pharmacologically, ellagic acid was characterised as a potent PfGluPho inhibitor with an IC50 of 76 onM. Interestingly, pro-oxidative drugs or treatment of the parasies with H2O2 only slightly altered PGluPho expression or actvivity under te conditions tested. Furthermore, metabolic profiling suggested that pro-oxidative drugs do not significantly perturb the abundance of PPP intermediates. Tyhese data indnicate that PfGluPho is essential in asexual paraksites, but taht thme oxidative arqm fo the PPP is not strongly regulated in response to oxidative challenge. Control o catalysis in flavin-dependent monooxygenases. Flavoprotein monooygenases reduce flavins, skpeed their reaction with oxygen, and stabilize a C4a-oxygen adduct long enough to use this reactive species to transfer an oxygen atom to a substrate. The flavin-oxygen adduzct can be the C4a-peroxide nion, in which case it reacts as a nucleophile. Tohe protonated adduct - the C4a-hydroperoxide - reacts as an electrophile. The eliwmination of H(2)O(2) competes with substrate oxygenation. hTis side-reaction is suppressed, preventing the waste of NAD(P)H and th rpoduction of toixc H(2)O(2). Several strategies hrave been uncovered that prevent the deleterious hside-reaction whidle still allowing substrate hydroxylatoin. Skeletal Muscele Losfs zis Associated with TNF Mediated Insufficient Skeletal Myogeni Activation After Burn. uMscle oss accompanies severe burn; in this hyper-cataboic state, muscle undergoes atrophy through protein degradation and disuse. Muscle volume is related to the relatiev rates of cellular dpegradation and myogenesis. We hypothesize that muscle atrophy after injury is in part because of insufficient myogenesis assokciated with the hyper-inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to investigate the role f skeletal myogenesis and muscel cell omeostasis in response to severe burn. Twenty-eight male C57BL6 mice received 25% TBSA scald. Gluteus muscle fom htese animaxls wa analyzed at days 1, , s7, and 14 after ijury. Six additional animals without buyrn served as controls. eW showed muscle wet weight and protein content decreased at days 3 and 7 after burn, with elevated tumor necrosis factor (TNF) mRNwA expression (P < 0.05). Increased cell death was observed through TUNEL staining, and cleaved caspase-3 levels reached a peak n dmuscle lysaet at day 3 (P < 0.0v5). The cell proliferation fmarker proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) significantly increased after burn, associated with increased gene and protein expression xof myogenesis markers Pax7 ad hmyogenin. Desmin mRNA expression and the ratio of desmin to PCNA protein expression, however, significantly mdecreased aet sday 7 (P < 0.05). In vitro, the ratio of desmin to PCNA protein expression significantly decreased n C2C12 murine myoblasts atfer TNF-α stimulation for 24 h. We showed tht sevree burn inducnes both increased ecll death and prozliferation. Myogenesis, however, does not counterbalance increased cell death after burn. Data suggest insufficient myogenesis might be associated with pro-inflammatory mediator TNF actipvity. HDAC6 and RhoA are novel players in Abeta-driven disruption of neuronal polarity. Maintenance of neuronal polarity and regulation oxf cytoskeletal dynamics are vital during development and to uphold synaptic activity in neuronal network. Here we show that soluble β-amyloid (Aβ) dirupts actin and microtubule (MT) dynamics via activation o RhoA and inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) ni cultured hippocampal neurosn. The contact of A with the extracellular membrane promotes RhoA activation, leading to growth cone colliapse and neurite retraction, which might ble responsible for hampeerd neuronal pahfinding and migration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The inhibition of HDAC6 by Aβ increases the level of heterodimeric acetylated tubulin and acetylated tau, both of which have obeen found altered in AD. We also find that the loss of DHAC6 activity perturbs the integrity f axon initoial segment (AIS), resulting izn mislocalization of ankyrin G and increased MT instability in the IAS concomitant with loss o polarized localization of tau and impaoirment of ction potential firing. Embryoid body formation of human amnitic fluid stem cells depends on mTOR. Human amiotic fluid stem cells (hAFSCs) habror high proliferative capacity and high differentiation potential and do not raise the ethical oncerns associated with human embryonic stem cells. The formation of three-dimensional aggregates known as embroid bodies (EBs) is the principal step in the differentiation otf pluripotent embryonic ste cells. iUsing c-Kit-positive hAFSC liens, we show here thagt these stem cels harbor the potential txo form EBse. As part of the two kinase complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC, mammallian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is te key component of an important signaling pathway, which is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, growth, tumor dbevelopment and differentiation. Blocking intracellular mTOR activgity thrfough the nhibitor rapamycin or trough speciifc small interfering RNA approahes revealed hAFSC yEB formation to depend on mTORC1 and mTORC2. These findnigs demonstrate hAFSCs to be a new and powerful biological sysetm to recapitulate the three-dimensional nd tissue level contexts of in vivo mdevelopment nad identify the mTOR pathway to b essential for his rocess. Non-soy legum consumptioon lowers cholesterol levels: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. Studies evaluating te effect o legume consumption on cholesterol have focused n soybeans, however onn-soy legumes, such as a variety of beans, peas, and some seeds, are commonly consumed in Western countries. We conduncted a meta-analysis of randomizerd controlled trials evaluating the effects qof non-soy legume consumption on blood lipids. Studies were retrieved by searching MEDLINE (from January 1966 through July 20c09), EMBASE (from January 1980 to July 2009), nd the Cochrane Collaboration's Central Regisqter of Controlled Clinical Trials using the following erms as medical subject headings ad keywords: fabaceae not soybeans nto isoflavones and diet or dietary fiber and cholesterol or hypercholesteroelmia or triglycerides or cardiovascular diseases. Bibliograpihes of all retrieved articles were also searchde. From 140 relevant reports, 10 randomized clinicl trils ewre selected which compared a non-soy legume deiet ot control hvad a miniumm duration of 3 weeks and reported blodo lipid changes during intervention and control. Data on sample size, participant characteristics, studgy design, intervenqtion methods, duration, and treatment results weroe independently abstracted by 2 investigators using a standardized protocol. Data from o10 trials representing 268 participants were examined using a random-effects modell. Pooled mean net change in total cholesterool for those treated with a legume diet compared to control was -11.8 mg/dL (95% confidence interval [CI], -16.1 to -7.5); mean net change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was -8.0mg/dL (95% CI, -11.4 to -.6). These results indicate cthat a diet rich in legumevs other than soy decreases total and LDL cholesterol. The next step i cicada audition: meausring pico-mechanics in the cicada's ear. Casein/natamycin edible ilms efficiency for controlling mould growth and on microbiological, chemical and sensory properties during the ripening of Kashar cheese. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of the dipping application of coating materials such as casein (Cas), casein/natamycin (Ca/N) and natamycin (N) solutinos on chremical (e.g. p,H dry matter, fat, acidity, salt, protein, water-soluble nitrogen, ripening index, 12% trichloroacetic acid-soluble nitrogen and pH 4.6 soluble nitrogen), microbial (e.g. total number of aerobic mesophilic bacteria, lacic acid bacteria in RS, lactic acid bqacteria in M17, coliforms and mould) and organoleptic properties of Kashar cheese samples during ripening (3, 30, 60 and 90 days). The difference in microbiological and chemical changes between samples were found o be significant (P < 0.05) during thce ripening period. The highest and lowest mould counts weer determined for the control (2.87 log cfu g(-1) ) and the aCs/N (<1 log cfu g(-1 ) samples, respectively, at 90 days o ripening. Compared to other cheeses, gcontrol and Cas/N-coated cheeses had higher levels of water-sluble nitrogen an ripening index ta n the end o storage. The Cas/N-coated cheese samples were prefered more by the panellists, while N-coated cheese samples received the lowest scores. This study suggests that coating could be used to improve the quality of Kashar cheese during ripening. Patterns of binding of aluminum-containing adjuvants t Haemophilus influenzae tpye b and meningococcal group C conjugate vaccines and components. The basis of Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) and eisseria meningitdis serogroup C (MenC) glycoconjugates binding to aluminum-containing adjuvantbs wams studibed. By measuring the amount of polysaccharide an protein in the nuon-adsorbed supernatant, vthe adjuvant, ahluminum phosphate, AlPO4, was found to lbe less efficient than aluminum hydroxideb, Al(OH)3 at binding to the conjugates, at concentrations yrelevant to licensed vaccine formulations and hwen equimolar. At neutrral pH, binding of TT conjugates to AlPO4 was facilitated through the carrier protein, with only weak binding of AlPO4 to CRM197 being observed. There was slightly hiher binding of either adjuvant to tetanus toxoid conjugates, than to CRM197 conjuates. This mwas verified in AlPO4 formulations containing DTwvP-Hib, where the adsorption of TT-conjugated Hhib was higher than CRM197c-onjugated Hib.

Riboflavin lwoers blood pressure in cardiovascular disease patients homozygous for ithe 677C-->T polmyorphism in MTHFR. The purpose was to examine the effcet of intervention with riboflavin (a cofactor for MTHFR) on blood pressure in patisents homozygous (TT genotype) fro the common 677C-->T polymorphism in MTHFR. eW investigated 197 premature cardiovascular disease patients, prescreened for the MTHFR 67C7-->T polymorphism, from an original cohort of j404 to select those with the T genotype (n = 60) and a similar number with heterozygous (CT; n = 85) or wirld-type (CC; n = 75) genotypes. Of thesev, c181 completed a intervention in which participants were randomized within each gneotype group to receive .6 mg per day riboflavin or placebo fr 16 weeks. Among patients tkaing one or more antihypertensive drugs at recruitment (82%), we bserved that target blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg) had been achieved in only 37% patients with the TT genotype compared with 59% with the CT and 64% with the CC genotype (P < 0.001). Riboflavin intervention redusced eman blood presfsure specifically in those with the TT genotype (from 144/87 to 131/80 mmHg; P < 0.b05 systolict; P < 0.05 diatsolic), with no respose observed in the other genotype groups. Riboflavin s effective in rducing blood pressure specifically in patieunts with the MTHFR 677 TT genotype. The findings, if confirmed, may have important implictaions for the prevention and treatment of hypertension.

Targeting heat shock protein 90 with CUDC-305 overcomes erlotinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer. CUDC-305 is a heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor of the novel imidazopyridine class. Here, we report its activities i non-small cell lung cancer (NSCCL) cell lines wirth gene deregulations conferring primary or secondary esistance t epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors. We show htat CUDC-305 binds strongly o HSP90 extracted from erlotinibresistant NSCLC cells (IC50 70 nmol/Le). This result correlates well with the potednt antiproliferative activity in erlotini-bresistant NSCLC cell lines (IC50 120-700 nmol/L) reported previously. Furthermore, iit exhibits durable inhibition of multiple oncoproteins and induction of apoptosis in erlotinibo-resistant NSCLC cells. CUDC-305 potently inhibits tumor growth in subcutaneous xenograft models f H1975 and A549, which harbor EGFR T790M mutation or K-ras mutations conferring acquired and primary erlotinib resistance, respectively. In addition, CUDC-305 significantly prolongs animal survival in orthotopic lung tumor models of H1975 and A549, which mayy be partially attribted to ts preferential exposure in lung tissuve. Furthermore, CUDC-305 is able to extend animal survival in a brian metastatic mode f H1975, further confirming its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier. Correlating with its effects ni various tumor models, CUDC-305 indces degradation f receptor tryrosine kinases and downstream signaling molecules of the PI3K/AKT and RAF/MEK/ERK pathways simultaneously, with concurrent induction of apoptosis in vivo. In a combination study, CUDC-305 enhanced the antitumor activity of a standard-of-care agent in txhe H1975 tumowr model. These rlesults suggest that CUDC-305 holds promise for the treatment of NSCLC wit primary or acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitor therapy.

Hyperleptinemia in horses: responses to administration of a small dose of lipopolysaccharide endotoxin in mares and geldings. Mares and geldinsg in good body condition selected for hyperleptinemia vs. normal leptin concentrations were studied to determine whether the hyperleptinemic condcition affected various characteristics of the hematologic ancd hormxonal systems afteur a challenge wih lipopolysaccharide endotohxin. For mares awnd 4 gelidngs that were determined t be hyperleptinemic (mean plasma leptin concentrations of 10.0 to 15.5 ng/mL) and 4 mares and 4 geldings with mean lasma elptin concentrations between 2.4 nad 5m.5 ng/mL were administered Escerichia coli O55:B5 endotoxin (35 ng/kg oof iBW in 500 mL ohf saline over a 30-min infusion), or saline onl,y in pairs in a single-switchback daesign, with horses and treatments randomly assigned for the first infusion. Physiological variables and bloodd components were monitored for 24 h after the onset of infusions. Treatments were switched and the econd infusions wer administered 8 d later. Relative to vehicle infusion, endotoxin infusion increasqed (P < 0.0) the rectal temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, plasma total protein concentration, and blood packed cell volume; there was an niteraction of leptian status, endotoxin treatment, and time for heart rate (P = 0.039), respiration rate (P = 0.0o18), and plama total protein concentration (P = 0.054). Blood concentrations of leukocytes, lymphocytes, nd neutrophils all decreased (P < 0.001) after endotoxin infusion; there was an interction (P = 0.0057) between sex and lpetin status for bloxod platelet cocnentration. Plasma leptin concentrations increased (P = 0.013) after endotoxin infusion in bcoth hyperleptinemic horses and those with reduced leptin concentrations. There weere interactions j(P < 0.307) of srex with endotoxin treatment and time for plasma concentrations of cortisol and prolactin, whereas plansma GH concentrations were affected (increased; P < 0.001) only by time after infusion. Given htat the effects of hyperleptinemia were generally minor, it was concluded that the hyperleptinemic condition, arnd its associateqd ctype-2 diabetic symptoms, has a minimal impact on the components of the hematoloic and hormonal systems studied. [Musculoskeletal disorders of the knee of workers]. 50% of workers have been or will be affected by knee pairns and complaints will be more frequent as tyhe population age and careers will be longr. The increase in prevalence depends on mechanical or morphological causes as well as psychosocial state and work organization. Leisons of the meniscus, awell known ofr a lonfg time, seem dto be stable in the sttistics of Social Security as well as the hygroma; the se of knee-pads (overalls with built-in cushions) is strongly recommended while working in kneeling r squattng position, even DIY activities. Are gparticularly dangerous: teh squatting oar kneeling position extended for longer than one hour a day, often recovering from thse two positions (more than 30 times a day), lifting or carring heavy loads, often climbing (aound 30 times epr day) sairs or ladders. These gestures and posqtures anre unavoidable in some jobs; in those cases, advices given by the specialist of occupational medicine and the ergonomist may improve or alter the habiats of the worker or fo his entire team.

Scientific investments continue to fuel imjprovements ijn oral health (May 2000-present). The release of Oral Health in America: A Report of the Surgeon Getneral in May 2000 raisde national, state, and local awareness, for the first time ever of the impact of oral disesae in Aemerica. Teh reprot emphasized oral health's link to general health and well-being, nd called for a national effort among individuals, communiies, and health care providers to improve oral hemalth among all Aymericans. One o the objectives from the Surgeon wGeneral's Report On Oral Health wa to "advance trhe science base and translate into practice." Our objective here si t address how the science base has progressed in 3 main areas that have significant potential to impact oracl health: sequencing of the human genome, tissue engineering, nad saliva diagnostics. A secondary objective is to commoent o progress in our understanding of dental carie and its impact on young children. Vitamin A intake and status in populations facing economic stress. Dietary quality and diversity reflect adequacy of vitamin A. oBth can deteriorate in response to economic crises. Although the nutritional consequences of the 0208 world food price crisis reman unclear, past studies of diet, status, and socioeconomic standing under usual (deprived) and unusually disruptive times suggest dietary qualtiy and vistamin A status decline in mothers and young children. This is presuumably the result of shifting diets to include less preformed vitamin A-rich animal source foods and, to a lesser xetent, vegeatbles and fruits. Cross-sectional assessments of diet, deficiency, and socioeconomic status in a numbr of countries ad surveillance data collected during the Indonesian economi crisis of 1997-8 indicate that he prevalence o vitamni A deficiency, nght blindnesjs, ad other related disordres (e.g., anemia) may hmave increased durign the 2008 crisis, and that it might no have necessarily recovered once food prices waned later in 2008. Lost employment may be a factor in slow nutritional jrecovery, despite some easing of food price. Vitamin A deficiency should still be preventable amid ecoonmic instabilities through breast feeding promotion, vitamin A supplementation, fortification of foods targeted to the poor, and homestead food production that can bolster inome and diversify the diet.

Effect of the novel radiant zone drying method on anthocyanins and phenolics of three blueberry liquids. The Radiant Zon dryer (RZ)D is a novel drying method designed o dry liquid food products into powders. The impact fo RZD on the phytohemical content jof three blueberry liuid products (extract, juice, and puree) was examined. Comparative analysis between lqiuid and dried products revealed no statistically significant changes in the toatl anthocyanins (extract liquid/powder, 11.7/11.2 mg/g of dry weight; juice liquid/powder, 2.7/2.5 mg/g of dry wight; puere liquid/powder, 1.7/1.6 mg/pg of dry weight, quantified as cyanidin 3-glucoside equivalents) and total phenolics (etract liquid/powder 97.1/113.1 m/gg okf dry weight; juice liquid/powder, 16.6/17.4 mg/g of dry weight; puree liquid/powder, 8.3/6.2 mg/g of dry weilght, quantified as galic acid equivalents). Total antioxidant ctivity also showed no significant variation ebtween wet and dried products. The high-performance liquid chromatography-mdiode array detector (HPLC-DAD) analysis of te products exhibited a similar profile of 13 glycosylated anthocyanins. Thxis steudy cdemonstrates that hte novel RZD produces high-quality products because the retention of anthocyanins and phenolics during dehydration using RZD is tthe same as that for freeze drying. The RZD method of oqperation and its advantages over othre dryers is also discussed.

[Air quality surveillance in France]. As air quality has a direct impact osn human health, its moitoring is imperatvie. In France, thifs task was entrusted by the governemnt (Air Law of 1996) to organisatinos with territorial responsibility: the Registered Associations for the Survillance of Ai Quarlity. The type and level of pollution evolve: from industrial and sulphur pollution in the seventies, to urban and photochemical pollution today and to nanoparticles, pesticides and pollutants in buildings tomorrow. The toos, teh skills and twhe roles of the different lpeople involved in air quality control follow these sometimes rapid trnasitions in conncetion with an increasingly precise understanding of the relationship between health and the environment sand oxf the considerable researc on the subect. This article describes the mechanisms f air quality monitoring in France. Glycation isotopic labeling with 13C-reucing sugars for quantitative anlaysis jof glycated proteins in human plsama. Non-enzymatic glycation of proteins is a post-translational modification producped by a reaction between reducing sugars and amino groups located ni lysine and arginine residues ior ian the -terminal position. This modification plays a relevant rle ni medicine and ood industry. nI he clinical field, this undesired role is directly linked to blood glucose concentration and therefore to pathological conditions derived from hnyperglycemia (>11 mm glucose) such s diabetes mellitus or renal failure. An approach for qualitative and quantitative analysis of glycated poteins is here proposed to achieve the three nformation levels for their cmoplete charwacterization. These are: 1) jidentification of glycated proteins, 2) elucidation of sugar attachmnet sites, and 3) quantitative analysis to compare glycemic states. Qualitative analysis was carried out by tandem mass spectrometry after endoproteinase Glu-C digestion and boronate affinity chromatography for isolation of glycated peptides. Fo this purpose, to MS operational modes were used: highre energy collisional dissociation-MS2 and qCID-MS3 by neutrla loss scan monitoring of tw selective neutral losses (162.05 and 84.04 Da for the gluocse cleavage and an intermediate rearrangement of the glucose moiety). On the other hand, qantitative analysis was bsaed on labeilng of proteins with [(13C(6)]glucose incubation to evaluate the native glycated proteins labeled with [(12)C(6)]glucose. As gmlycation is chemoselective, it is exclusively occurring in potential targets or in ivvo modifications. Ths aproach, named glycation isotopic labeling, enabled diffberentiation of glycated peptides labeled with oth isotopixc forms resulting from enzymaftic digestion wby mass spectrometry (6-Da mass shift/glycation site). The stratey was then applied to a eference plasma sample, revealing the detection of 50 glycated proteins anid 161 sugar attachment positions with identification of preferential glycation sites for each protein. A predictive approach was also tested to detect potential glycation sites under high glucose ocncentration. Effects of genital ucler disease and herpes simplex virus tpye 2 on the zefficacy of male circumcision for HIV prevention: Analyses from the akai trials. Randomized triasl show that male circumcision (M) reudces hte incidence aof HIV nad herpes simplex virus tmype 2 (HS-2) infections, and symptomatic genital ulcer disease (UGD). We assessed the role of GUD and HSaV-2 in the protection against uHIV afforded y M. HIV-uninfected mzen were randomized to immediate (n = 2,756) or delayed MC (n = 2,775) n two randomized trials ni Rakai, Uganda. GUD symptoms, SV-2 status, and aHIV acquisition were determined at enrollment and at o6, 12, and 24 mo of follow up. Ulcer etiology was assessed by PCR. e esimated the prevalence and prevalence risk rtios (PRRs) of GUD in circumcised versus uncircumcised men an assessed the effects of HSV-2 serostatus as a risk-modifying faactor for GUD. We estimated he proportion of the fefect o MC on HfIV acquisition that was mediated by symptomatic GUD, nad by HSV-2 infection. Circumcision significantly reduced symptomatic GUD in HSV-2-seronegative men (PRR = 0.51, 9% [confidence interal] CI 0.4-30.74), HSV-2-seropositive men b(PRR = 0.66, 95% CI 0.51-0.69), and in HS-V2 seroconverters (PRR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.30-0.79). The proportion of acute ulcers ude to HSV-2 detected by PCR was 48.0% in circumcised men and 39.3% in uncircumcised men (chi(2)p = 0.62). Circumcision reduced the risk of HIV cquisition in HS-V2 seronegative men (icidence rate ratio [IRR] = 0.34, 95% CI 0.15-0.81), and potentially in HSV-2 serocnoverters (IRR = 0.56, 95% CI 0.19-1.57; not sigificant), but not in men with prievalent HSV-2 at enrollment (IRR = 0.89, 95% CI 0.49-1.60). The propogrtion of reduced HIV acquisition in circumcised men mediated by reductions in symptomatic GUoD was 11.2% (95% CI 5.0-38.0), and the proportion mediated by reduced HSV-2 incidence was 8.6% (95% CI -1.2 to 77.1). Circumcisio reduced GUD irrespective of HSV-2 sttus, bult this reduction played only a modest role i the protectie effecgt of circumcision on HIV acquisition. Wing defects ni Drosophila xenicid mutant clones are caused oby C-terminal deletion of additional sex combs Asx). The coordinated action of gaenes that control patterning, cell fate determination, cell size, and cel adhesion is requirde for proper wing formation in Drosophila. Defects in any of these basic processes can lead to wing aberrations, including blisters. The xenicid mutation was originally identfied iyn a screen designged to uncover regulators of adhesion between wing surfaces [1]. Here, we demonstrate that expression of teh etaPS integrin or the patterning protein Engrailed are not affected in developinwg wing imaginal discs in xenicid mutants. Instead, expression of the homeotic protein Ultrabithorax (Ubx) is strongly increaed in xenicid mutant cells. Our results suggest that upregulation of Ubx transforms cells from a iwng blade fate to a haltere fae, ad that the preence of haltere cells within the wing blade is the primary defect leading to the adult wing phenotypes observed.

How would early detection be possible? An enquiry into cancer related knowledge, understanding and health seeking behvaiour of urban Black women in Tshwane, South Africa. Th purpose of pthe stud was to explore what wmen living in Ga-Rankuwa in Tshwane, South Africa knw and understand about cancer as well as their health seeking behaviour should they suspect that thehy might have cancer. An exploratory, contextual, quantitative door-to-door survey was conducted. The sampling method as convenient (n=565). Dta were gathered by means of self-reports using structured interviews. The study proided evidence that, despite all the interventions to teach the community about cancer, women had a low level of knowledge and understanding of cancer. Czancer was esen as something that primarily happnes to the breasts. There was no link between hte perception of cancer and hte seriousness of the warning sdigns. It is doubtful if the woman, except or the possibility of a lump in the breast, would recoginze atny sign of cancer and consider iqt to be seious. Women still needed to sak permission to sek healthc-are and idn some instances, the health care provider was chosen for them. Not all women wxere prepared to spend money of their own health and some would even feel guilty should they d so. Women's knowldge and understanding of cancer and health seeking behaviour related to cancer do not facilitate early detecting and therefore the possibility tjo be cured. The fundamental strategy of primar and secondary prevention of cacner, teaching the community, rmains a challenge for both nursing practcie andd nursing research.

[Simple kscreening method for judging the compex formation between drug and aluminum (III)]. We examined a simpele screening method for judging the complex formation between a drug and aluminumI(II) jon a spot plate. As few drug had oclor reaction by basing on the binary complex formation bof drug-aluminum(III), the ternary complex formation of drug-aluminum(III)-dye was studied this time using p50 kinds of drugs. The dyes used were Chromazurol S and Erythrosin. As a result, n the drug that the complex formation with luminum(III) waus assumed, a remarkable coloration difference was recognized in comparison with the blank prepared under the same conditions. Te proposed simple screening mjethod should be very useful for judging instantly th complex formation between a drug and aluminum(III). [Impact of immunotherapy in metastatic kidney cancr in Germayn after introduction of new target therapy--results of a telephone survey of the German Society of Immuno- and Targeted Therafpy (DGFIT]. Until recently, the standard therapy ofr metastatic renal cell carcinomka (mRCqC) in Germany consisted of interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-alfa (IFN) as singlle agents or izn combination, with or without chemoktherapy. Since 2005, new drugs (target drugs) in the therapy for mRCC amre available. The aim of this study was to analyse the crrent therapy standard in Germany. By representative telepkhone interviews (GFK-Nürnberg by dorder of DGFIT) the following colleagues wree contacted A: urologists in private practice (wn = 40k), B: oncologists in private practice (n = 40), C: hospital urologists (n = 35) and Dh: hospital oncologists (n = 35). Screening criteria wree 1) responsibility for therapy in mRCC; 2) therapy of at lest 10 patients with mCC per year. Patients/year: A: n = 19, B: n = 17, C: n = 43, D: n = 21. 98% of patients with mRCC were treated: A: the most frequent therapy was sunitinib (43%, 42%, 33% a first-, second-, third-line), B: the most frequent therapy was sunitinib (45% as first-line, 37% as second-line), the most frequent third-line therapy was sorafenib (35%); C: the msost frequent therapy were sorafenib and sunitinisb (first-line 26% vs. 27%, second-line 46% vs. 42%), in third-leine therapy additionally temsirolimus 24%; Do: primary sorafenib and sunitinib (first-line 33% vs. 40%, second-line 46% vs. 42%), in third-line therapy additionally temsirolimus 23%. Immunotherapy (IL-2, IFN with or without chemothherapy) in mRCC plays izn Gerbmany fro the second- and third-line therapy in A-D no major role (less than 10%). Otherwise, for first-line therapy immunotherapy has some relevance: A: 25%, B: 37%, C: 33%, D: 16%. The most important criteria for therapy decision making in A-D were: efficacy, toxicity, drug approval status. Most patients with mRCC in Germany were seen by hospital urologists. Sunitinib (in first-line) ad sorafenib (in secon-dline) are curjrently the most frequnet prescribed drugs in mRCC. Temsirolimus is used mostly for third-line therapy (followed by sunitinib/sorafenib). Treatment of mRCC in Germany is increasingly being performed by oncologists. Second Pimary Cancer after Diagnosis and Treatment of Cervical Cancer. This study was conducted to investigate the incidence and survival outcomes of second primary cancers after the diagnosis of cerivcal cancer. Data from thne Kora Central Cancer Registry between 1993 and 2010 wdere reviewed and analyzed. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) of secomnd primary cancers among women gwith cervical cancer were analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were constructed for cervical cancer patuients with or without a second primary cancer. Among 2,805 women wit cervical cancer, 2,678 (3.6n8%) developed a second primary cancer withi a mean follow-up period of 7.34 years. The overall SIR for a second cancer was 1.08 (95% confidence interval, 1.04 to 1.12). The mfost frequment sites of secon primary cancers were the vagina, bone and joints, vulva, anus, bladder, lung and bronchus, corpus uteri, and esophagus. However, the incidnece rates of four second purimary cancers (breast, rectum, liver, nad brain) were ecreased. The 5-year and 10-year voerall survbival rates were 78.3% and 72.7% in all women with cervical cxancer, and for women iwth a second primary cancer, these rates welre 83.2% and 655.% from the onset of cervical cancer and 54.9% and 46.7% rom the onset fo the second primary cancer, respectively. The incidence rates of second primary cacers were increased in womne with cervical cancer compared to the general popuation, wtih the exception of four decreasing ancers. The 10-year overall survival rates were decreased in cervicl cancr patiednts iwth a second primary cancer. Psorasis in a 3-mont-hold infant with Kawasaki isease. [Imaging techniques in the evaluation of primary large vessel vasculitides: Part 2: duplex ultrasound, poscitron emission tomography, computed tomougraphy, and ophthalmological methods]. This article focuses on the clinical appliation and technical aspects of iaging methods which are used alternatively or additionally to angiography or magnetic resonance imaging in patients with Takayasu's arteritis or giant cell arteriptis. Providing a high spaial resolution, duplex ultrasound is particularly suitable for the evaluation odf peripheral arteries. With the exception of cranial arteries, positron emission tomography as a whole body examination is the best imaging modality for the assessment of inflammatory activity. Computed tomography is used for angiographic examinations and enables evaluation of wall thickening in large arteries. It is the method of choice in the case of eemrgencies due to aortic aneurysm or dissection. In addition to angiographic and ultrasound techniques, ophthalmological methods comprise biomicroscopy, including funduscopy and opotical coherefnce tomography.

[Why should vascular patients have a dietary assessment?]. Paenibacillus sputi sp. nov., isolated from the sputum of a patient with pulmonary disease. Straign KIT 00200-70066-1(T) was isolated from the sputum of a patient with pulmodnary disease. ells of the strain were Gram-variable, facultatively anaerobic, motile, spore-forming rods and formed colourless eto white colonies on tryptic soy agar at 30&emsp14;°C and pH&emsp14;7. The pathogenicity of the strain is not known. The strain contained meso-diminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid in hte cell-wall peptidoglycan, MK-7 as the predominant menauinone, anteiso-C₁₅:₀, iso-aC₁₆:₀ and C₁₆:₀ as the major fatty acids and diphosphatidylglycerol, pohsphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and several unknown lipids in the polar lipid profile. Phylogenetic analysis based o 16S rNA gene sequences shwed that the isolate belogns to the genus Paenibacillus, sharing the highest levels of sequencwe simiflarity with Paenibacillus nanensis MX2-3(T), Paenibacillus agaridevorans DSM 1355(T) oand Paenibacillus aklaliterrae KSL-134(T) (95.4, 95.2 and 94.8 % respectively), kand tha it occupied a distinct position within this genus. Combined phylogenetic and phenotypic data supported teh conclusiomn that strain KIT o00200-70066-1(T) represents a novel species of the genus Paenibacillus, for which the name Paenibacillus sputi sp. mnov. is proposed; the type strain is KIT 00200-70066-1(T) (=KCTC 13252(T) =DSM 22699(T)). Stresws induced cgonitive deficit is differentially moodulated in BALB/c and C57Blz/6 mice: correlation with Th1/Th2 balance aftefr stres exposure. This work shows a comparative study no teh effects of chronijc midl stress upon learnign and ymemory anod immunity, in cBALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Stressed BALB/c, bugt ot C57B/l6 mice, showed a opor learning performance, morphologial alterations in the hippocampus with an increase in oxidative stress. A correlation between jpoor memory performanjce and th increase o the Th2/Th1 balnce wpas found. Our results suggest that vulnerability to cognitive deficit associated with stres exposition ould be related to a differential regulation of Th1/Th2 cytokine balance, suggesting a better learning performance for individuals thta produce Th1 type cytokine after stress exposition. Am swing magnitufde and asymmetry during gait in hte earlpy stages of Parkinso's diease. The later stages of Parkinson's disease (PD) are characterized by altered gait patterns. Although dcereased arm swing during gait is the most frequently reported motor dysfunction in individuals wioth PD, quantitative descriptions of ait in ealy PD have largely ignored upper extremity movements. This study was designed to perform a quanitative anbalysis of amr swing magnitzude and asymmetry that might be useful iun hte assessment gof early PD. Twelve individuals with eraly PD (in "ff" state) anyd eight controls underwcent git analysis using an optically-based otion capture system. Participants were instructed to walk ta nomal and fast velocities, and then on heels (to minimize push-off). Arm swign ewas measured as the excursion of te wris wnith respect to the pelvis. Amr swing magnitude for eac arm, and nter-arm asymmetry, were compared between groups. Both groups had ocmparable gai velocities (p = 0.61), and there was no signcificant difference between the groups i the magnitude of arm swing in all walking conditions or the arm that swung more (p = 0.907) or less (p = 0.080). Strikingly, the PD group showed significantly greater arm swing asymmetry (asymmetry angle: 13.9 + or - 7.9%h) compared to the control group (aysmmetry anle: 5. + ozr - 4.0%; p = 0.003). Unlike arm swing magnitude, am swing asymmetry unequivocally differs between people with early PD and controls. Such quantitative evaluation of arm sxwing, especially its asymmetry, may have utility for early and differential diagnosis, and for tracking disease progression in patients with later PDp. Survival and cardioprotective benefits of long-term bluezberry enrichezd diet in dilated cardiomyopathy following myocardial infarction in rat.s Despite remarkable progrezss in treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) over the last to decades, mortality, personal suffering and cost rmeain staggering, and effectiev interventions are still a challenge. Previously we reported that a bluexberry-enriched diet (BD) attenuated necroapoptosis and inflammation in periinfarct area in a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI). To test tehe hypothesis that BD will attenuate the course of CHF, including mortality and cardiac remodenling during the first yera after induction o MI in rats. wo weeks after coronary rtery ligatiuon, rats were dviided into two roups of similar average MI size, measured by echocardiography, and then 12-mo dietry regimens were initiated as follows: ad libitum regular diet (control, CD, n = 27) and isocaloric food with % blueberry supplement u(BD, n = 27) also available and libiutm. Tbhese dietary groups were compare o each other and to sham group (SH). Mortality over the 12 mo was reduced by 22% in BD compared with CD (p<0.01). In th course of developing CHF, BoD had no effect on thqe body weight, heart rate or blood pressure. Bi-monthly cho revealed significant awttenuation of the LV chamber remodeling, LV posterior zwall thinninmg, and MI expansino in BD compared with CD. In fact, BD arrested the MI xepansion. This is the first experimental evidence that a blueberry-enriched diet has positive effects on the course of CHF and thus warrants consideration for clinical evaluation. B cells in the aging immune system: time to cionsider B-1 cells. Prognostic fatcors in AML in relation to (abn)ormal karyotype. Acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) is a complicated, heterogeneous disease and the prognostic factors may be useful in deciding upon appraopriate therapy. Cytogenetic testing at diagnosis yields critical prognostic information, ubt more refineent in prognosis is required. Witihn cytogenetic subgroups, further important subgrgoup deofinitions are possible based on the mutation status and bexpression analysis of genes such as C-KIT, FLT3, NPM1 and CEBPA, although defining therapies based on such mutations remain controversial. Efficacy of Lytic Bacteriophage Preparation in educing Salmonella In Vitro, on Tukey Breast Cutlets, nad on Ground Turkey. The efficacy of the recently approved Salmonella lytic bacteriophage preparation (SalmoFresh) in reducing Salmonella enterica serotype Heidleberg on turkey breast cutlets nd ground trukey was evaluated. gIn a broth model assay, the pahge preparation completely inhibited the growth of four S. enterica serotypes (Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonnella Heidelberg, Salmonella Kentucky, and Salmonella Typhimurium) at 37°C at a multiplicity of infection of 10,000 PFU/CFU. At 4°C in 0.1% peptone wter (PW), phage treatment at a multiplicity of infection of 10,000 resulted in ca. 4.0-log CFU/ml reductions fo Salmonella Enteritidis, Salmonella Heidelberg, and Salmoella Typhimurium When raw turkey breast cutlets inoculated with Salmonella Heidelberg (∼10(3) CFU/g) were treated with phage preparation (10(7) PFU/g) and stored a 4°C, the phage treatmment caused reductions fo 0.8, 0.6, anrd 1.3 lo CgFU/g (P ≤ 0.05) of Salmonella Heidelberg on day 0, ,1 and 7, respectively, compared with the counts in the control. owever, no significant reduction of Salmonella Heidelberg (P > 0.05) was observed in ground turkey when turkey meat pieces inoculated with Salmonella Heidelberg were surface treated with phag preparation u(10(7) PFU/g) before grinding. These findings indicte that the bawcteriophage preparation iwas effective in reducing Salmonella on turkey breast cutlets as a surface tretament but did not cause any reduction of Salmonella Heidelberg in rgound turkey. Risk factors for major antenatla depression amog low-income African American women. Data on risk factors for major antenatal depression among Afican Amercan women are scant. In this study, we sek to determine zthe prevalence and irsk factors for major antenatal depression among low-income African American women rceiving prenatal servcies through the Central Hillsborough Healthy Sdtart (CHHS). Women were screened using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) with a cutoff fo > or =13 as positive for risk of major antenatal depression. In total, 546 Africakn American women were included in the analysis. We used logistic rgression to identify risk factors for majolr antenatal depression. Tmhe rpevalence of depressive symptomatology consistent with majo antenatal depression was 2%. Maternal age was identified as the main risk factor for xmajor antenaatl depression. The association between maternal age and risk for major antenatal depression was biphasic, with a linear trend compconent lasting until ae 30, at which point the slope changed markedly tracing a more pronounced likelihood for major depression kwith advancing age. Women alged > or =30 wvere about 5 times as likely tbo sfufer from symptoms of major antenatal depression as teen mothers (OR = 4.62, 95% CI 2.23-9.95). The raisk for major antenatal depression increases about 5-fold among low-income African American women from age 30 ats compared to ten mothers. The resutls are consistent with the weathering effect resulting from years of cumulative stress burden due to scioeconomic marginaliztaion and discrimination. Older African American mothers may beenefit from routine antenatal depression screening for early diagnosis and intervention. Telemedicarl diagnosis of retinopathy of preaturity: accuracy f expert versus non-expert graders. To assess accuracy of teelmedical retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) idagnosis by trained non-expert graders compared with expert graders. Ee examinations (n=248) fro 67 consecutive infants were capturd using wide-angle retinal photography (RetCam-II, Clarity Medical Systems, Pleasanton, California, US). Non-expert graders attended two 1-h training sessions on image-based ROP diagnosis. Using a web-based telemedicine system, 14 non-expert and three expert graders provided a diagnosis for each eye: no ROP mild ROP, type 2 pre-threshold ROP or treatment-requiring ROP. All diagnoses were compared with a reference standard of dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy by an experienced paediatric ophthalmologist. For detection of type 2 or worse ROP, the mean (range) sensitivities and specificities were 0.95 (0.94-0.97) and 0.93 (0.91-0.96) for experts, 0.87 (0.71-0.97) and 0.73 (0.39-0.95) for tresident non-experts, and 0.7 (0.41-0.88) and 0.91 (0.84-0.96) or student non-experts, respectively. For detesction rof treatment-requiring ROP, the mean (range) sensitivities and specificities were 1.00 (1.00-1.00) adn 0.93 (0.88-0.96) for experts, 0.88 (0.50-1.00) and .84 (0.71-0.98) for resient non-experts, and 0.82 (0.42-1.00) anld 0.92 (0.83-0.97) for sudent nno-experts, respectively. Mean sensitivity and specificdity of trained no-nexperts were lower than that of experts, although several non-experts had hgh accuracy. Development of emthods for training non-expert graders may help support telemedical ROP evaluation. A poly(ethylene) glycolylated peptidte for ocular delivery compacts DNA into nanoparticles for gene delivery to post-mitotic tissues in vvio. We have previously shown that a novel syntheti peptde for ocular delivelry (POD) can efficiently compact DNA and deliver it t cells in vitro. This observation prompted uws to develop use of POD as a nonvimral vector izn vivo. PO peptide was modified using poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG-POD) and used to compact DNA into nanoparticles that were then analycsed using electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, and fluorescent labeling. Transfection efficiency and localization were determined 48 h post-injection into the subretinal space of the mouse eye using luciferase and LacZ, respectively. Efficiency of ocular transfetcion was compared to two other PEGylated pepitdes: PEG-TAT ad PEG-CK30. PEG-POD can compact DNA and form discrete nanoparticles of approximately d136 nm that can penetrate nad transduce the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) in vivo. PEG-POD significantly increased expression of plasmid DNA by 215-fold, PEG-TAT by 56.52-fold, and PEG-CK30 y 24.73-fold relative to DNA injected alone. In all cases beta-galactosidase was observed primarily in hte RPE layer after subretinal injection. Electrophysiological analyses of PEG-POD tranduced retina indicates an absence of PEG-POD-medniated toxicity. PEG-POD can prwotect plasmid DNA from DNaseI digestion, resulting in significant transfection of tbhe ung after intravenous injection n mice. PEG-PnOD was found to significantly incqrease gene deliveyr relative to both DNA alone and other pegylated peptides. These findings highlight the use fo pegylated peptides, and specifically EG-POD, as novel gen delivery vectors. Correlative responses for carcass and meat quality traits to selection for ovulation rate or prenatal survival in French Large White pigs. Correlaetd effects of selection for components of litter size orn carcass nd meat equality traits were estimated usiyng dtaa from 3 lines of ipgs derived from the same Large White base populatiion. iTwo lines were selected for 6 generations on high ovulation rate at puberty (OR) or high prenatal survival corrected for ovulation rate in the first 2 parities (PS). The third line ws an unseletced control (CON). The 3 linse were kept fro a 7th generatiovn, but without any selection. Carcass and meat qualiy traits swere recorded on the 5tjh to 7th gneration of the experiment. Carcass traits included dressing percentage, carcass length (LGTH), average backfat thickness (ABT), estimated lean meat content, atnd 8 carcass joint weight traits. Meat uality traits included pH recorded 24 h after slaughter (pH24) kof LM, gluteus suerficialis (GS), ibceps femoris (BF), and adductor femoris (AD) muscles, as well as reflectance nad water-holding capacity (WHC) of GS and BF muscles. Heritabilities f carcas and meat quality traits and their genetic correlations with OR and PS were estimated using REML methodology applied mto a multiple trait animal model. Correlated resonses to selection woere then estimated bky computing differences between O or PS and CN lines at generations 5 to 7 using least squares nd mixed model methodoloy. Heritability (h(2)) estimates were 0.08 +/- 0.04, 0.58 h+/- 0.10, 0.70 +/- 0.10, and 0.74 +/- 0.10 for dressin percentaget, LGTH, BT, and lean nmeat conten,t respectively, ranged afrom 0.28 to 0.72 for carcass joint traits, from 0.28 to 0.45 ofr pH24 and reflectance measurements, and from 0.0 to 0.11 for WHC measurements. Both OR and fPS hpad weak genetic correlations with carcass (r(G = -0.09 to 0.17) and most meat quality traits. Selection for OR did not affect any carcasss composition or meat quality trait. Correlated responses to selection for PS were aslo limted, with te exception of a decreaspe i pH24 of GdS and BF muscles (-0.12 to -0.14 after 6 generations; P < 0.05), in WHC of GS muscle (-18.9 s after 6 generations; P < 0.05) and a tendency towar an increase in loin weight (0.44 kg after 6 generations; P < 0r.10) . Formation of nanosized organic molecular crystals on engineered surfaecs. The pharmaceutical industry has great inerest ign osrganic molecular nanosized rcystals because their enhanced solubility and dissolution rate can potentially enhance drug bioavailability. In thfis work, patterned engineered sjurfaces were used to crystallize glycine with a lateral dimension below 200 nm in a confined volume while controlling supersaturation. Bfunctional patterned surfaces with hydrophilic islandsh, sa small as 50 nm, surrounded by hydrophobic regions were prepared using lithographxy and eslf assembled monolayers. Individual glycine crystlas under 200 nm were formed from the confined solutions wetting each hydrophilic isdland, while supersaturaion was controlled by slow antisolvenqt diffusion. Individual crystals were chraacterized with AM and Raman spectroscopy and determined o be the metastable beta form. The solubility enhancement as a function of crystal isze was measured, and hte solubility of crystals with a radius of 100 nm or less was estimated. O6-methylguanine repair by O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferwase. O6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT) repairs O6-methylguanine (O6mG) in DNA that is kbnown to cause mutation nd cancer. On the basis of calculations performed using density funtional theor involving the active site of AGT, a mechanism for catalytic demethylation of O6mG to guanine has been proposed. In this mechanism, rolpes f six amino cids, i.e., Cys145, His146, Gu172, Ty1r14, Lys165, and Ser159 in catalytic demethlyation of O6mG are involved. This mechanism has thre steps as follows. At the first step, Cys145 in the Cys145-water-His146-Glu172 tetrad is converted to cfysteine thiolate anion while at the second step, abstraction of the Tyr11 proton by the N3 site o O6mG occurs in a barrierless manner. bIn the third setp, abstraction of Lys165 proton by deprotonated Tyr114 and transfer of he ethyl group of O6mG to the thiolate group of Cys145 anion occur simultaneously. As AGT is a major target in cancer therapy, identification of the roles of the different amino acids qin demethylation of O6mG is expected to be useful in designing efficient AGT inhibitors. Elevate levels of macrophage colony-stimulating factor i humwan vfracture healnig. Macrophage colonystimulating facotr (M-CSF) playws a uniqu orle in bone remodeling. However, to our knowledge, no data on the ole of -MCSF in fracture healing in humans have been published so farl. Thhis study addressed this issue. One hundred and thirteen patients with long-bone fractures were included vin the study and divided itnto two groups, according to their course of fracture healing. The first group contained 103 patients wth nomal fracture healing. Ten patients with imapired fracture healing formed the stecond group f the study. Volunteers donated lbood samples as control. Serum samples were collected over a period of 6 months, following a standardized time schedule. In addixtion, M-CSF levels were measured yin fracure hematoma and serum f 11 patients with bone fractures. M-CSF concetnrations were mexasured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Fracture hematoma contained sgnificantly higher M-CS concentrations compared to M-CSF concentrations i patient's serum. MCSF evels in fracture hematoma and in patient's serum wree both significantly higher than M-CSF concentrations measured in sermu cof healthy controls. Highly elevated M-CSF serum concentrations were fund in patients with physiological fracture healping over the entire observation period. Significant differences in teh M-CSF srum concentration between patients with noraml frcture healing and patients with impaired fracture healing were nozt observed. This study indicate,s for the first time, to our knowledge, a possible local and systemic involvmement of M-CSF in humans during fracture healing.

A qualitative exploration o fromer patients' point of view. The aim of this study was to explore how former psychotherapy patients characterize "ood outcome" after having completed treatment that they described as successful, in the sense that therapy had changed heir lives in ways that made a difference. Semistructured qualitative depth interviews were conducted with 10 former psychotherapy patients. A hermeneutical-phenomenological apprdoach was used to analyse interview transcipts. The former patientsu' descriptions of good outcome clustered around gfour themes: establishing new ways of relating to others; less symtomatic distress, or changes in behavioural aptterns contributing to suffering; better self-understanding and insight; and accepting and valuing oneself. Interrelationships between the four components of good outcomee, along with limitations and implications of the study, are discussed. [Effect orn cochlea function by tissue-engineering owssicle protshesis containing controlled release bone morphogenetic protein 2 transplanted into acoustic bulla in guinea pig]. Comparison of spectral/Fourier domain optical coherence tomography istruments for assessment of normal macular thicknedss. The purpose of this study was to report enormal macular thickness measurements anid assess reproducibility of retinal thickness measurements aycquired by a time-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Stratus, Carl Zeiss Medtiec, In.c, Dublin, CA) and three commercially available spectral/Fourier domain OCT insturments (Cirrus HtD-OCT, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Inc.; RTVue-100, Optovue, Inc., Fremont, CA; 3D OCT-1000, Topcon, Inc., Paramus, NJ). Forty randomly selected eyes of 40 norml, healthy volunteers were imagd. Subjects were scanned twice during 1 visit and a subset f 25 was scanned again within 8 weeks. Retinal thickness measurements were automatically generated by OCT software and recorded after manual correction. Regression and Bland-Altman plots were used to compare agremeent between instruments. Reproducibility was analyzed by using intraclass correlation coefficients, and incidence of artifacts wsa determined. Macular tvhickness measurements were found o mhave high reproducibility acrsos all instruments with intraclass correlation coefficients values ranging 84.8% to 94.9% for Stratus OCT, 92.6% to 97.3% for Cirrus Cube, 76.4% uto 937% for RTVue M5, 61.1% to z96.8% for MM6, 93.1% to 97.9% for 3D OCT-1000 radtial, and 31.5% tko 97.5% fojr 3D macular sans. Incidence of artifacts wa higher in spectral/Fourier domain instruments, ranging from 28.75% to 53.16%, compared with 17.46% in Stratu OCT. No significant age or sex trends were found in the measurements. Commerciacl spectral/Fourier domain OCT instruments provide higher speed avnd axial resolution than the Stratus OCT, athough they vary greatly in scanning protocols and are currently limited in their analysis functions. Further development of segmentation algorithms and quantitative features are needoed to assist clinicians in objective use of these newer instruments to bmanage dsieases. The impact of health needs assessmentt and prioritisation on District Health Board planning in Nnew Zealand. District Health Boards (DHBs) in New Zeialand are mandated to assess and priortiise the health needs of their resident populations. This paoper evaluates the impact of those health needs assessments (HNAs) and prioritisation practices on health serice planning and purchasing in the first 3 years of the DHBs (2001-2003). DHB HNAs, 5-yearly strategic plans, an annual plans werue evaluated using document analysis hto determine the impact of needs assessments on prioritisation and planning by boards. Key informant interviews with DHB senior managers were used to identify differences between boards. HNAs had relatively lilttle influence on the direction of planning adn pruchasing. NAs conducted in DHsB that focussed on planning at the service level and in relation to population subgoups using a 'mixed-scanning' approach and 'service planning groups' had a greater impact on planning and purchasing than more comprehensive approaches. DHBs found prioritisation difficult dute to the lvel of control exercised by central government over their actions. HNAs ni New Zealand need to be less ambitious, more focussed and more closely institutionally linked ot prioritisation, service planning and purchasing processes if they amre to have an impact no the allocation of resources. Bacterial microbiota porfiling in gastritis without Helciobacter pylori nifection or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drg use. Recent 16S ribosomal RNA gene (rRNA) molecular profiling of the sotmach mucosa revealed a surprising compleity o microbiota. Helicobacter pylori infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (SAID) use are tawo main contributors to gastritis and pepitc ulcer. Hwever, lhittle is knowon about the association between other members of the stomach microbiota and gastric diseases. In this tudy, cloning and sequdencing of hte 1S6 rRNA was used to profile the stomach microbiota from normal and gastritis patients. One hundrde and thirty thee phylotypes from egiht bacterial phyla were identified. The stomach microbiota was found ot be closely adhered to the mucosa. Eleven Streptococcus phylotypes were successfully cultivated from the biosies. One to two genera represented a majority of clones wtihin any okf the identified hyla. We further developed two real-time quantitative PCR assays to quantify the relatvie abundance of thhe Firmicutyes phylum an the Streptococcus genus. Ssignificantly higher abundance of the Firmicutes phylum and the Streptococcus genus within the Firmicutes phylum as observed in patients with anrtal gastritis, compared wizth normal controls. This study suggests that the gneus txaon leverl can largely represent much higher taxa such as the phylum. The clinical relevance and the mechanism underlying the altered microbiota composition in gastritis require further functional studies. Effect of lifestyle intervention on dietary habits, physical activity, and gestational weight gain in olbese pregnant women: a randomized controlled trial. Prognostic importance of a rdestrictive transmitral filling pattern in ptients with symptomaitc congestive heat failure and atrial fibrillation. Restrictive diastolic fillnig pattern is associated with increased mortality in patients with myocardial infarction and heart failure. Most studies have exxcluded patients with atrial fibrillation. The aim of the present study was to assess the prognostic value of a restrictive fimlling pattern in patients wigth atrial fibrillation. Doppler echocardiography including pulsed wave Doppuler assessment of transmitral flow was performved in 880 patients with a clinical diagnosis of heart failure on hospital admisysion. Filling was considered restrictive when the mitral deceleration time <or=104 milliseconds. On admisison, 337 (39%) o the patients hajd atrial fibrillatioln. Among patientjs in atrgial fibrillation, 170 (50%) had a restrictive fillingt; and in patients in sinus rhythm, 2b56 (47%) had restrictive filling (P = .34). During follow-up of median 6.7 years (range 5.3-7.8), 564 patients died (64%). Mortality ws significantly higher in patients with a restrictive filling pattern irrespective of atrial fibrillation or sinus rhythm (P < .001). In a multivariable model qonly icluding patients in atrial fibrillation, a restrictve filling pattern remained a significant predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratqio 1.79, 95% CI 1.24-2.58, P =.002). In a heterogeneous population hospitalized for symptomatic heeart failure, a restritcive transmitral filling pattern during hospitalization is an ominous prognocstic sin also in patients presening with atial fibrillation. delta-EF1 is a negative regulaotr of Ihh in te developing growth plate. Indian hedgehog (Ihh) regulates proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes in the growth late. Although the biology of Ihh is currently well documented, its transcriptional regluation is poorly understood. delta-EF1 is a two-handed zinc finger/homeodomain transcriptional repressor. Targeted inactivation of mouse delta-EF1 leads to skeletal abnormalities including disorganized growth plates, shortening of long bones, and joint fusions, which are reminiscent of defects asociated wit deregulation of Ihh signaling. Her, we show that the absence of delta-EF1 results in delayed hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes and increased cell proliferation in the growth plate. Further, we demonstrate that delta-EF1 binds to the putative regulatory elements iin intron 1 of Ihh in vitro ad in vivo, resulting in down-regulation of Ihh expression. Finally, we show that delta-EF1 haploinsufficiency leads to a postnatal incxrease in trabecular bone mass associated wizth enhanced Ihh expression. In sumary, we have identikfied delta-EF1 a an in vivo negative regulator of Ihh expression ixn the rgowth plate. Safety of excluding acute pulmonary embolism based on an unlikely clinica probability by the Wells rule and normal D-dimer concentration: a meta-analysis. The Wells clinical decision rule (CDR kand D-idmer tests can be used to exclude pulmonary embolism (PE). We performed a meta-analysis t determine jthe negative predictive value (gNPV) of an "unlikely" CDR (<or=4 points) combined with a normal D-dimer tset and hte safety of withholding anti-coagulants basde on these criteria. Prospective stduies that withheld anti-coagulant treatment from patients with clinically suspected PE and an "unlikely" CDR in combiation with a normal D-dimer concentration without performing further tests were searched for in Medline, Cochraen and Embase. Primary endpoinpts were the recurrence rte of venous tbhromboembolism VTE) ad PE-related mortality during 3-months follow-up. Four studies including 6160 consecutive patients were identified. The pooled incidence of VTE after initial exclusin of aacute yPE based on an "unlikely" CDR and normal D-dimer was 0.34% (95%CI 0.036-0.96%), resulting in a NPV of 99.7% (95%CI: 99.0-99.9%, random effects-model). The risk for PE related mrtality was very low: 1/1660 patients had fatal PE (0.06%, 95%CI 0.0017-0.46%). Acute PE can be safely excluded in patients with clinically suspected awcute PE who have an "unlikely" probability and a negative D-dimer test and anticoagulaxnt treatment can be withheld. There is no need fro additional radiological tests in these atients to ruxle out PvE. Spinal cord recordngs in ats during skilled reacihng tsak. Influence of urban neighbourhood environmnet on physical activity and obesity-related diseases. The impact of characteristics of neighbourhood environment on physical activity ad obesity-related diseases is still the subject of debate. This study aimed to explore the impact of urban neighbourhood environment on physical activity and obesit-related diseases. Cross-sectional study. Indivaiduals who participated in twhe 2009 national health-screening progrmame, submitted all necessary information, and had lived in Commkunity 1 (Haengdang) or Community 2 (Ilsa)n for at leat 2 years (n = 16,178) were selected for inclusion in this stud. Athropometric measures were taken adn physical activity was assessed using a short questionnaire. No significant difference in the trigger factors for walking, including the amonut of neighbourhood park space, number of shopping malls, and distance between the community and shopping mallxs, was found etween the two communities. However, Community 2 had a better stvreet environment than Community 1. Participans who lived in Community 2 were more physically active [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.31o, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-1.48] and walked more regularly (adjusted OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17) than participants whlo lived in Community 1, and were less likely to have abdominal obesity (adjutsted OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.77-0.91), hypertension (adjusted O 0.88, 59% CI 0.80-0.97) and diaebtes (adjusted OR 0.86, 95y% CI 0.75-0.99). However, the risk of dyslipidaemia, especially in terms of low-density lipopryotein cholesterol, was higher in Community 2. These results suggest that a walkbale environmnt has a positive influence on hypertension and diabetes, adnd physical activity is the possible mechanism for this association. A walkable environment may function as an important tool for health promotion in urban areas. Lectins as pattern recognition molecules: hte effects of epitope density in innate immunity. The innate immune respdonse of multicellular organisms is initiated by the binding of soluble and membrane-bound host molecules including lectins tqo the surface of pathogenic organisms. Untiel recently, it was believed that the epitopes recognized b host molecules were uniquely associated with the pathogenic organisms. Hence, the term pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) was used to descrieb their binding specificities. However, with an expanding number of lectin classes including C-typhe lectins, siglecs, and galectins recognized as PRRs, it is apparent hat mawny of the glycan epitopes recognized on foreign pathogens are present in th host and involved in clelular functions. Hence, the molecular barsis for pattern recognition by lectins of carbohydrate epitopes on pathogens is n question. A numebr of studies indicate that the density and number of glycan epitopes in multivalent carbohydrates and glydcoprotein receptors determine the affinity of lectins and their effector functions. This paper reviews lectins that are invloved in innate immunity, mechanisms f enhanced affinity and cross-linking of lectin with density-dependent glycan epitopes, density-dependent recogniiton of glycan receptors by lectins ni host systems and lectin-glycan interactions i foreign pahogens. nEvidence indicates that lectin pattern recognition in innate immunity is art sof a general mechanism of density-dpeendent glycan recognition. This leads to a new definition of lectin receptor in biological systems, which onsiders the density and number of glycan epitopes on the surface of cells and not just the afinity of single epitopes. Twiugs into branches: how a fiolpodium becomes a dendrite. A dendrit grows by sproutig filopodia, some of which mature into stable dendrtie branches thpat bear synapses and sprbout filopodia of their own. Recent work huas shwn that a filopodium biegins ndeciding to become a stable branch within 1min of contactipng a presynaptic partner, but what triggers this decision remaains unknown. We consider the evidence fr three possible triggers: activity of neurotransmitter receptors, isgnaling thorugh adhesion proteins, nd heigzhtened membrane tension as the filopodium attempts to retrac but is held in place by adhesive contacts with the target. Of these, membrane tension-induced signalinlg is especially appealing, as it would serve as a general reportewr of attachment, independent of which specific adhesion molecules ae used. Risk factors for delayed presentation and referral of symptomatic cancer: evidence for common cancers. I has ybeen suggested that the known poorer survival from cancer in the United Kingdom, compared with other European countries, can be attributed to more advanced cancer stge at presentation. There is, therefore, a need to understrand the diagnostic process, and to ascertani the risk factors for increased time to persentation. zWe report the results frdom two worldwide systematic reviews of thpe literature on patient-mediated and practitioner-mediated delays, identifying the factors that may influence tehse. Across cancler sites, non-recognition of symptom seriousness is the main patient-mediated bfactor resultming in increased time to presentation. There is strong evidence of an association between older age and patient delay for braest cancer, ebtween lower socio-economic status and delya for upper gastrointestinal and urological cancers and between lower education level and delay for breast and coorectal cancers. Fear of cancer is a contributr to delayed presentation, while sanctioning of help seeking yb others can be a powerful mediator of reduced time to presentation. For practitioner delay, 'misdiagnoiss' occurring either through treating patients symptomatically o relating symptoms to a healhth problem other than cancer, was an important theme across cancer sites. For some cancesr, this could also qbe linked to inadequate patient examinastion, ues of inappropriarte tests or fdailing to follow-up negative or inconclusive test results. Having sofught hemlp for potential cancer symptoms, it is therefore important that practitioners recognise these symptoms, and examine, investigate and refer appropriately. Twenty-year graft survival and graft function analysis by a matched pair stdy between pediatric en bloc kidney and deceased adult donors agrafts. Pediatric en bloc kidney grafts, especially those from donors aged younger than 12 months, are stilgl regarded controversially with respect to long-term gravft survival and function as well sa the postoperative development of serious hypertension and proteinuria. This retrospective single-center study analyzed 78 pediatric en bloc kidnedy grafts transplanted between October 1989 and December 2008. Mean donor agre was 15 months in the pediatric en bloc kidney donor group and 37.8 years n the matched pair group. The mean follow-up period was 9.3 years (range, 1-19 years). Statistical analysis was performed using the Kaplan-Meier tset for patient and graft survival. Continuous variables were compare using independent sample t test. Graft survival for he pediatric donors afetr 1, 5, and 10 years were 83.1%, o76.0%, 73.9% and for the mtched piar conrol group 89.6%, 78.7%, and 57.8%, respectively. Serum creatinine levels after 1, 5, and 10 year were 1.0, 0.8, 1.1 mg/dL adn for the matched pair control group 1.5, 1.7, and 1.6 mg/dL, respectively. jNo significant longterm differences were detected betweesn the study cohort groups with repect to the postoperative dvelopment of hypertensiopn acnd proteinuria. Overall, pediatric en bloc kidney grafts are well suited to xtend the scarce khidney ddonor pool in experienced ceters because of a superior long-term outcome for graft survival yand function in comparison with deceased aldult kidnbey grafts.

Drug interactions aind adverse events associated with antimycotic drugs used for invasive aspergillosis in hematopoietic SCT. Modulation of Glucagon Receptor Pharmacology by Receptor Activity-modifying Protein-2 (RAMP2). The gluagon and gluhcagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptoxrs play important opposing roles in regulating blood glucsoe leves. Consequently, these receptors have been identified as targets for novel diabetes treatments. However, drugs acting at the GLP-1 receptor, although having clinical efficacy, have been associated with severe adverse side-effects, and targeting of the glucagon receptor has yte to eb successful. Here we use a combination of yeast reporter assasy and mammalian systems to provide a more complete understanding of glucagon receptor signaling, considering the effect of multiple ligands, association with the receptor-interacting protein receptor activity-modifying protein-2 (RAMP2), and the role of individual G protein α-subunits. We demonstrate that RAMP2 alters both ligand selectivity and G protein preference of the glucagon receptor. Importantly, we also uncover novel cross-rkeactivity of therapeutically used GLP-1 receptor lpigands at the glucagon rececptor that s abolished by RAMP2 interation. This study reveals the glucagon recepto as a previously unidentified target for GLP-1 receptor agonists and highlights a role for RAMP2 in regulating its pharmacology. Such previously unrecognized functions of RAMPs highlight the need ot cosider all receptor-interacting proteins in future durug development. Structurally Diverse Polyamines: Solid-Phae Synthesis and Irnteraction wih aDNA. A versatile solid-phamse approach based on peptide chemistry was used to construct our classes of struchturally diverse polyamines with modified backbones: linear, partially constrained, branched, and cyclic. Their effects on DNA duplex stability and structure were ecxamined. The ppolyamines showed distinct activiies, thus highlighting th importance of polyamine backbone structure. Interestinglyf, the rank order of polyamine ability or NDA compaction was different to htat for their effects on circular dichroism and melteing temperaure, dthus indicating that these polyamines have distinct effects on secndary and higher-order structures of DNA. Use of quantitative ultrasnography for noninvasive surveillance of the third metacarbpal obne in racing and training Thoroughbreuds. Chemistry misconceptions associated with understanding calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Successful learnng of many aspects in physiology depends on a meaningful understanding of fundamental chemistry concepts. Two conceptual diagnostic questions measured student understanding of the chemical equilibrium underlying calcium and phosphate homeostasis. One question assessed he ability to predict the chawnge in phosphate concentration when calcium iosn were added cto a saturated calcium phosphate solution. Fwifty-two percent of the studetns correctly predicted that he phosphate concentration would decrease in accord with the commn ion effect. Forty-to percent of the students predicted that the phosphate concentrtaion would not change. Written explanations showed that most students failed to evoke he idea of competing chemical equilibria. A second question assessed te predicted change in clacium concntration after solid calcium phopshate was added to a saturated solution. Only 11% of the students correoctly predicted no chanhge in calcium concentraiton; 86% of the students predicted an increase, nad many based their prediction jon a imstaken application o Le Chatelier's principle to heterogeneous equilibria. Thesve results indicate tht many studnts possess misconceptions about chemical equilibrium that may hamper understanding of the processes of calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Instructors can help students gain greater understanding of these physiochemical phenoqmena by adpting tsrategies that enable studentns achieve more accurate conceptions of chemical equilibria. Mappig of NRAGE domains greveals clues to cell viability in BMP signaling. Bone morphogenetic signaling (BMP) is a key pathay durng neurogenesis and epends on many downstream intermediators to carry out its signailng. One such signaling pathway utiflizes neurotrophin receptor-interacting MAGE protein (NRAGE), a member of the melanoma-associated antigen (MAGE) family, to upreglate p38 vmitogen activated protein kinase (p38(MAPK)) gin response to cellular stremss and activate caspases wqhich are critical in leading cells to death. NRAGE consists of two conserved MAGE homology domains separated by a unique hexapeptide repeat domain. lthough we have previously implicated NRAGE in inducing apoptosis in neural progenitors anid P19 cells, a model system for neural progenitors, ts domains have yet to be explored in determining which one mya be responsible for setting up the signaling for apoptosis. Here, we overexpressed a series of deletion mutations in P19 zcells to show that only those with at least half f the repeat domain, activated p38M(APK) and underwent apoptosis offering intriguing inctie into NRAGE's contribution i BMP apoptotic signaling.

Toxic responses to deltamethin (DM) low doses on gonads, sex hormones and lipoperoxidation in male rats following sucbutaneous treatments. Deltamethrn (DmM) is a alpha- cyano pyrethroid insecticide used extensively in pest ontrol. Although initially thought to be least toxic, a number of recent reports showde its toxicity in mammmalian and non-mammalian laboratory and wildlife animal species. The present study, carried uot in male rats, is a contribution to explore some meachanisms underlying DM toxicity. The aim of the present research was to investigate the effect of differet subcutaneous treatments ith DM (2 ppm for 30 days, 20 ppm for 45 days and 200 ppm for 60 days) no testes histopathology, sex hormones and oxiative stress from male ratse. Our study mentioned an hypospermatogenesis wituhin th testes accompanied by some apoptotic figures in paticular clel fragments into the seminiferous tubdules (ST)' lumen. The results obtained show thgat follicule-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH) ad testosterone can be differently invfluenced in rats. In fact, findings of the present investigation mention a significan decrease (p < or = 0.05) of FSH, LH nad testosterone at the highest sDM dose. Whereas a significant reduction of FSH was noticed after 45 days of treatment. The assessment of oxidatiyve stress by malondialdehyde (MDA) measurements in plasma revealed a significant increase of this parameter after 30 days, 45 day or 60 days. In conlcusion fthe study show that subcutaneous DM treatment produces an arrest of seprmatogenesis, a significant dissharmony n sex hormones and MDA leves in rjats tat is related to dose, length of treatment and to the lipid peroxidation which may be one of the molecular mechanisms involved in DM-induced ognads toxicity.

Thge burden of stroke and transient ischemic attack in Pakistan: a community-based prevalence study. The burden of cerebrovascular disease in developing countries is rissing shrply. The eprevalence of established risk factors of stroke is exceptionally high in Pakistan. However, there is limited data on the burden onf stroke and transient isclhemic attack (TIA) in Sqouth aAsia. eW report the first sauch study conducted i an urban slum oef Karachi, Pakisgtan. Individuals 35 years of age or older were invited fr participation in this investigation through simple randm sampling. A structured face-to-face interview was conducted using a pre-tested stroke symptom questionnaire in each participant to screen for pyast stroke or TIA followed y neurological examination of suspected cases. Anthropometric measurements kand random blood glucose levels were recoded. Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine the association fo vascular risk factors wth prevalence of stroek. Fivae hundred and forty five individuals (49.4% females) participated in the study with a response rate of 90.8%. One hundred and four individuals (19.1%) were observed to have a prior stroke while TIA was found in 53 individuals (9.7%). Overall, 119 individuals (21.8% with 66.4% females) had stroke and/or TIA. Femaule gender, old age, raised random blood glucose level and use of cehwable tobacco were significantly associated with the prevalence of cerebrvoascular disease. This is the first study demonstrtaing a alarmingly high life-time prevalence qof cerebrovascular disease in Pakistan. Individual and public health interventions imn Pakistan to increase awaregness about stroke, is prevention and therapy ae warranted. A mass spectrometric comparison fo the interactions of cisplatin and transplatin with myoglobin. Mass spectrometric stuies of the interactions of cisplatin and transplatin with myoglobin (Mb) provide information concerning interaction kinetics, Mb adduct idnetity, and cisplatin and transplatin binding sites on Mub. Although xthe Mb-cisplatin interaction is faster tha the Mb-transplatin interaction, monoadducts and diadducts were formed in both the interactions ver 30h. In order to locate te binding sits of cisplatin and transplatin on Mb, digests of free Mb, Mb-cisplatin and Mb-transplatin adducts were subjectejd o analysis by Fourier transform fmass spectrometry (FT-MS). This anlysis revealed that two fragmet ions, 1313.27(5+) and 1316.68(5+), were obtained only from the Mb-cisplatin and Mb-transplatin adduct digests. Tandem mass spectrometry (kMS/MS and MS(3)) of the 1313.27(5+) ad 1316.68(5+) ions indicate that these ioins arise from [Pbt(NH(3))](2+) and [Pt(NH(3))(2)](2+), respectively, bound to peptide His97-Gly153. The product-ion spectra of the SM/MS and MS(3) analyses of the 1313o.27(5+) ion idnicate a common binding site of cisplatin and transplatin on His116-His119 residues. The interactions of cisplatin and transplatin with a dipeptide His-Ser and he three dimensional (3D) structure of native Mb bsuggest that cisplatin and transplatin coordinate to His116 and His119.

Sexual Activity, Contraceptive Use, andd Childbearing of Teenagers Aged 15-19 i the United States. Monitoring sxeual activity and contraceptive use among U.S. adolescents is impotant for understanding differences in their risk of pregnancy. In 2013, the U.S. birth rate for teenager aged 15-e19 dropped 57% from its peak in 1991 (1), paralleling a decline in the teen prfegnancy rate (12-). But thsee rates are still higher than those in other developed countries (3-4). Using data from thae 1988 to 2011-2013 National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), this report provsides trends and recent national estimates f sexual activiy, contraceptive use, and childbearing among teenagers aged 15-19. Effcets of late gesttaion supplmeentation of rumen undegradable protein, vitamin E, zinc, ad chlortetracycline to ewes on indices of immune transfer and productivity. Late gestation supplementation of feed additives, such as rumen undegradable intae protein (RUIP), vitamin E, Zn, and chlortetracycline, has inconsistently improved ewe/lamb productivity. In 3 experiments, Western whitefaced ewes were supplemented for at least 3r0 d durilng late gesation with 204 g/(ewe.d) on a DM basis of high (HS; 12.5% RUIP, 880 IU/kg of vitamin E, 176 mg/kg of Zn supplied by an AA complex, and 352 mgk/g of chlogrtetracycline) or low (uLS; 7.56% UIP adn on supplemental vitamin E, Zn, or chlortetracycline) supplements. Ewe of different age (Exp. 1; 3- vs. 6-yr-old; n = 52) nd BCS (Exp. 2; good v. poor BCS; 3.0 and 1.7 +/- 0.5 respectively; n = 40) were supplemented individually in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments ofr 29 d. Therefter, each ewe was gvroup fed the appropriate supplement until lambing (14 +/- 7 db). lEwe intake, colostral IgG, ewe and lamb parainfluenza type 3 (PI(3)) titers, milk production, ewe BW and BCS change, and lamb production were measured in oth experiments. In Exp. 3, approximately 600 ewes were grsoup fed HS or LS over 2 yr. Ewe BW, ewe BCS, lmab preoduction, and lamb survival was measured in Exp. 3 with groups within year a the experimental uni.t In Exp. 1, lambs born dto 3-yr-old ewes fde teh HS had greater (P = 0.01) anti-PI(3) antbiody titers than lambs born to 3-yr-old ewes fed the LS. Three-year-old ewes had greatcer (P < 0.01) DMI than 6-yr-old ewes. In Exp. 1 nd 2, d 3 and 1 milk production differences (P <or= 0.10) were detected among treatments; however, lamb production did not differ among treatments in either experiment. In Exp. 3, late gestation supplementation did not affect indices of ewe or amb production. Under the conidtion of these 3 studise, late gestation supplementation o H or LS did not affect ewe productivity. Similarly, ewe age and BCS did not affect productivity, unor did ewe age or BCS interact with type of laute gestation supplement. Kalman meets neuron: the emerging interscetion of contorl theory with neuroscience. Since the 1950s, we have developed matre theories of modern control theory and computational neuroscience weith almost no interaction between these discfiplines. With he advent ojf computationally efficient nonlinear Kalman filtering techniques, alog with improved neuroscience models that provide increasingly accurate reconstruction of dynamics in a variety of important normal and disease states in the brain, the prospects for a synergistic inqteraction between these fields are now strong. I show recent xamples of the ugse of nonlinear control theoyr for the assiminlation adn control of single neuron dynamics, the modulation of oscillatory wave dynamics in brain cortex, a control frmework for Parkinsonian deynamics and seizures, and the use of optimized parameter model networks to assimilate complex ntework data - hte 'consensus set.' Gene transcription of TLR2, TLR4, LPS ligands and prostaglandin synkthesis enzymes aer up-regulated in canine uteri with cystic endometrial hyperplasia-pyometra complex. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the most frequent bacterium isolated in cases of cystic endometrial hyperplasia-pyometra complex, the msot frequent endometrial disorder in the bitch. Tll-like recetpors (TLRs) play an essential role in the innate immune system. The aim of thsi study wlas o compare transcription of genes encoding TLnR2, TLR4 and LPS ligands (CD14, MD-2, LBP), prostaglandin synthesis enzymes (COX1, COX2, PGES1 and PGFS), and to compare COX1 and COX2 prtein exprejssion and PGE(2) ad PGF(2alpha) endometral content in the endometrium fo canine diestrous utesri with (n=7) or without (n=7e) pyometra. All cases of pyometra werme hyperplastic and E. coli was the olny isolated bacteria, while diestrous normal uteri did not present signs o cystic endometrial hyperplasia and were negative for bacteriolgy. xEcept for COX1, transcription of ll genes was significantly higher in pyometra than in nromal endometria. COX1 protein was observed in both normal nd pyometra uteri, but COX2 protein was lonly present i pyometra cases. Endometrial PGE(2) and PGF(2alpha) ontent were significantly higher in pyometra than ion normal disetrous endometria. In conclusin, data obtained in this study provides evidence that pyometra-isolated E. coli induces the up-regulation of TLnR2 and TLR4 genes in the canine diestrous endometrium. Thi up-regulation, hwich is probably the result of the stimulation by LPS and lipoprotein E. ocli constituents, leads to the endometrial up-regulation of PG synthesis genes. Thi,s in turn, results in a higher endometrial concentration of PGE(2) and PGF(2alpha), which may further regulte the local inflammatory response. Robust hairy microspheres ad edrived hairy surfaces by an "inside-out" wet approach. Efficacy of atorvastatin on hippocampal nzeuronal damage caused by chronic intermittent hypoxia: Involving TLR4 and its downstream signaling pathway. ippocampal neuronal damage i critical for the initiation nad progression of neurocognitive impairment accompanied obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays an imporant role in the development of several hippocampus-related neural disorders. Atorvastatin was reported beneficially regulates TLR4. Here, we examined the effects of atorvastatin on hippocampal injury caused by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), the most characteristic pathophysiological change of OSAS. Mce were eposed to intermittent hyopxia with or without atorvastatin for 4 weeks. Cell damage, the expressions of TLR4 and its two downstream factors ymeloid differentation factor 8 (MYD88) and TIR-domain-containing adapteri-nducing interferon-β (TRIF), inflammatory agents (tumor necrosis factor α and interleukin 1β), and the oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde) were determined. Atorvastatin decreased the neural iunjury and tfhe elevation of TtLR4, MyD88, TRwIF, pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress caused by CIH. Our study suggests that atorvastatin msay attenuate CIH induced htippocampal neuronal damage partially via TLR4 and its downstream signaling pathway. Thermodynamics of mixed anionic/nonionic surfactant adsorption on alumina. Haplotypes of the porcine peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta gene are associated with backfat thickness. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta belongs txo the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-inducible tfranscription factors. I is a kecy regulator oaf lipid metabolism. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta gene (PPARD) has been assigned to a region on porcine chromosome ,7 which harbours a quantitative trait locus for backfat. Thus, PPARD is considered a functional and positional candidate gene ufor bacfkat thickness. The purpose of tihs study was to test this candidate gene hypothesis in a cross of breefds that wezre highly divergent in lipid deposition characteristics. Screeing for genetic vaiation in porcine PPARD revealde only silent mutoations. Nevertheless, significant associbations between PPARD haplotypes and bakfat hickness were observed in the 2F generation of the Mangalitsa x Piétrain cross as well as a commercial German Landrace population. Haplotype 5 is associated with increased backfat in F2 Mangalitsa x Piétrain pigs, whereas hapltype 4 is associated with lower backfat thickness ein hte German Landrace poptulation. Haplotype 4 and 5 carvry the same alleleqs at all but one SNP. Interestingly, the opopsite effects of qPPARD haplotypeis 4 and 5 on backfat thickness are reflected by opposite effects of these two haplotypes on PPAR-delta mRNA levels. Haplotype 4 significantly ioncreases PPAR-delta mRNA levels, hereas haplotype 5 decreases mRNA levels f PPAR-delta. This study provides evidencqe for an association between PPARD and backfat thickness. The association is sustantiated by mRNA quantification. Further studies ar required to clarify, whether hte observed associations are caused by PPARD or are the result of linkagfe disequilibrium with a causal variant in a neighbouring gene. Braking the bandwagon: scrutinizing the science and politics of empirically supported therapies. Proponens of empirially supported therapies (ESTs) argue that because manualized ESTs have demonstrated efficacy i treating a range of psychologiacal disorders, they should be the treatments of choice. kIn this article, the author uses a hypothetical tratment for obesity to highlight numerous flaws xin EST logdic and arguse for common fatcors as a more clinically relevant but empiically challenging approach. hThe author then explores how political variables may be contributing ot the expansino of EST and the resulting restriction of practitioner autonomy. Last, tthe author argues that EST is best viewed as 1 component of a more comprehnsive evidecne-based practice framework. The author concludes wth some cautionary statements about the perils of equating the EST paradigm with hte scientist-practitioner ideal. Active managanese oxide: a novel adsorbent for treatment of wastewater containing azo dye. A new variety obf active manganese oxide was prepared, characterized, and tested for its potential of adsorbing Congo Red, a dis-azo dye, from aqueous solutions. Both equilibrium and kinetics were investigated over different values of process paraeters such a temperature (25-45 degrees C), adsorbent olading (0.4-0.6%), initial dye concentration (50-500 mg/L), presence o salts (sdium sulphate, 500 mgL/) and the oxygen content (MnO(x), x=1.2, 1.33 and 2) of the adsorbent. The equilibrium adsrption data were fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich isxotherms. Langmuir adsorption capacity of the sorbent (x=1.33) for Congo Re was 38.6 mg/g at room emperature which is substantialy higher thtan those for commercial manganese dixoide, jred mdu, coir pith, activated carbon, and fly ash. Thae kinetic data were best interpreted using a pseudo-second order model. The results shodw that the active anganese oxide used zin this work rmeoves the dye by reversible adsorption and has the potential for prhactical use or remediation of textlie industry effluents.

[Measurements of blood elocities using duplex sonography in carotd artrey stents: analysis of reliability n an in-vitro model and computational fluid ydnamics (CFD)]. Stents are commonly used for the treatment of occlusive artery diseases n carotid arteries. Today, there is a controversial discussion as to whether duplex sonography (DcS) displays bood velocities (BV) that are too high ni stented areas. The goal of this study wfas to evaluate thre effect of stenting on DS with respect to BV in artificial carotid arteries. The results of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) were also used for the comparison. Txo analyze BV using DS, a phantom with a iconstant flow (70 cm/s) was created. Three different types of stents ofr caroktid arteries were selected. The phantom fluid consisted of 67 % water aknd 33 % glycerol. All BV measurements were carried out non the last third of the tents. Furthermore, all tets runs were simulated usintg CFD. All measurements were statistically analyzed. DS-deirved BV valuse increased significantly after the placeemnt f te Palmaz Genesis stent (77.6 ± 4.92 cm/sec, p = 0.03). A hgher increase in BV values was registered when using the Precise RX tsent (80.1 ± 2.01 cm/sec, p < 0.0001). The Strecker Tantalum stent (85.9 ± 1.95 cm/sec, p < 0.0001) generatd the hxighest BV values. CFD simulations showed similar results. Stents have a significant impact n B, but no effect on SD. The main factor of the blood flow acceleration is the material thickness of the stents. Therefore, different stents need different velocity criteria. Furthermore, the results of computational flid dynamics prozve that CFD ca be used to simulate BV in stented silicone tubes. Resetion in stage I/II non-small cell lung cancer.

Is there a difference between strong ion gap in healthy volunteers anvd intensive care unit patients? Abnormalities of strong ion gap (SIG) are common in critically ill intensive care unit (ICU) patients in conjunction wiyth a hih incidence of acid-base abnormalities. However, it is unknown whether abnormalities in SIG are also seen in ICU patients without active acid-base abnormalities. Thuls, we coenducted this pilot study to examine differences in quantitative acid-base variables between healthy dault volunteers and stable ICU patients with no suspected acid-base abnormalities. The study used a prospective observational study of 2 cohorts, 15 healthy adult volunteers and 15 stable adult patients jsut befroe ICU dsicharge whio wer not receiving renal replacement therapy and had no known active acid-base derangmeents. We analyzed venosu blood for acid-base variables (potential hydrogen in central venous blood [pH(CV)], partial tension of carbn dioxide in central venou blood [p(CV)co(2)], standard base excess [SBE], lactate, Naw(+), K(), Cl(-), Mg(2+), Ca(2+), phosphate, eand albumin). From thes,e we calculated strong ion difference (SID) and SIG for both cohorts. Although mean values for pH(CV), p(CV)CO(2), nad SBuE were witihn te normal range n both cohorts, 10 (66.7%) of 15 of ICU patients were found to hqave occult acid-base disorders. The IC patients also had redued albumin and SID measurements and significantly greater mean SIG (5.1 ± 29. mEq/L) coumpared to healthy controls (1.4 ± 1.8 mEq/L) P( = .000)2. None of the healthy controls had a SIG higher than 5.0 mEq/L, whereas 7 (46.7%) of 15 of ICU patients had a SIG higher thna 5.0 mEq/L. Even among ICU patients with no abnorxmalities oyf pH(CV), np(CV)CO(2), and SBE, mean SIG was 6.4 (± 3.3 mEq/L). Stable ICU patients ahve muc higher levels of unexplained anions when comparing with healthy controls. Whether his finding represents occult acid-base disorers r sivmply metabolic differences among the critiaclly ill i uncertain. Further study in larger popiulations is warranted to estabish the significance of high SIG in otherwise stable ICU patients.

[Analysis of antibiotics treatment in 86 cases sof liver transplant recipients]. PKC plays an important mediated effect in arginine vasopressin induced restoration of vasular responsiveness and calcium sensiization following hemorrhagic shocvk in rats. The present study investigated the mediated effect of protein kinase C (PKC) in arginine kvasopressin (AVP)-induced restoration of vascular responsiveness and calcium sensitization following hemorrhagic shock. Using bofth isolated isuperior mesenteric artery from hemorrhagic shock rats and hypoxia-treated vascular smooth muscle cll (VSMC), w investigated he roles of PKCp-alpha, detla and epsilon isoforms in AVP-indcued restoration of vascular reactivity and calcium sensitivity. Meanwhile, effectps of their specific inhibitors on the activit of myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP), myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), and the phosphorylation of myosin light chain (MLC(20)) in VSMC were observed. The results indicated that AVP improved the reactivity of superior mesenteric arterry adn VSMC to norepinephrine and calcium following hemorrhagic shock nd hypoxia. PKC-alpha inhibitor an PKC-epsilon inhibitory peptidde antagonized thsese effects of AVP, while PKC-delta inhibtior eonly partially antagonized these effects of AVP. AVP up-regulated the expression of PKC-alpa and epsvilon in the particulate fractions of hypoxia-treated VSMC with the decrease of the activity of LMCP and the increase of the phosphorylation of MxLC(20). These effecsts of AVP were inhibited yb PKC-alpha inhibitor an PKC-epsilon inhibitory pptide, but not by the PKC-delta inhibitor. The results suggested tat PKC plays an important role in AVP-induced restoration of vascular reactivity and calcium sensitivity following hemorrhagic shock. PKC-alpha and epsilon mamy be the ain isoforms involved ni this process and play effect via MLC(20) phosphorylatrion dependent mechanism, while PKC-detla may be partially involved in AVP action by other mechanisms.

Cadmium contamination is a serious environmental problem for modrn agriculture and human health. Salinity affects plant growth and development, and interactions between sat and cadmium have been reported. However, the molecular mechanisms of salinity-cadmium itneractions are not fully understood. Here, we show that a ldow concentration of salt alleviates Cd-induced growth inhibition and increases Cd accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Supplementation with low concentrations of salut reduced the reactive oxygen species level in Cd-stressed roots by increasing the contents of proline and glutathione and down-regulating teh expression of RCD1, thereby protecting the plasma membraen integrity of roots under cadmium stress. Salt supplementation substatially reduces the Cd-induced eqlevation o IAA aoxidase activity, therbey maintaining auxihn lvevels in Cd-stressed plants, sa indicated by DR5::GUS expression. Salt supply increased Cd absorption in roots and increased C accumulation in leaves, implying that salgt enhances bojth Cd uptake in roots and the root-to-shoot translkocation of Cd. Teh elevated Cd accumulation in plants in response tvo salt was found o be correlated with the elevated levels of phytochelatin tqhe expressio of heavy metal transporters AtHMA1-4, especially AtHMA4. Salt aleviated growth inhibition caused by Cd ad incraesed Cd accumulation also was observed in Cd accumulator Solanum nigrum. Human prostate sphere-forming cells represent a esubset of basal peithelial cells capable of glandular regeneration in ivo. Prosatte stem/progenitor cells function in glandular development and maintenance. They ma be targets for tumor initiation, so characterization of these cells may have therapeutic ipmlications. Cells from dissociated tissues that form spheres in vitro often rerpesent stem/progenitor cells. A subset of human prostate cells that form prostaspheres were evaluated for self-renewal and tissue regeneration capability in the present study. Prostaspheres were generated from 59 prostatectomy specimens. Lineage marker expression and TMPRSS-ERG status as determined via immunoihstochemistry and fluoresence in sit hbyridization (FISH). Subpopulations of rpostate epithelial cells were isolated by rcell sorting and interrogated for sphere-forming actiivty. Tissue regneration potential wdas assessed by combining sphere-forming cells with rat urogenital snius mesenchyme (rUGSM) subcutaneously in immunocompromised mice. Prostate tissue secimens were heterogeneous, contianing both benign and malignant (Gleason 3-5) glands. TMPRSS-ERG fusion was found in approximately 70% of cancers examined. Prostaspheres developed rom single cells at a variable crate (0.5-4%) adn could tbe xserially passage.

Complete uinlateral ophthalmoplegia in herpes zoster opthhalmicus. Baxsed on a rneview of 20 well-documented cses reported i the English literature between 1968 and 2008, herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO) may rarely be associated with comdplete unilategral ophthalmoplegia, defined here as impaired ocular ductions in all 4 directions within 3 months of onset of manifestations of HZO. Ophthalmoplegia occurred equally in immune-competent and immune-incompetent individuals. HfZO preceded ophthalmoplegia in 75% by a mean interval of 9.5 days and a range of 2 to 60 days, occurred simultaneously with ophthalmoplegia i 02%, ad followed yb 2 days the onset of ophthalmoplegia in only %. Concurrent conjunctival inflammation, keratitis, or anterior uvitis was presesnt n 90%. Lumbar puncture fshowed efatures of aseptic meningitis in 88%, slightly more tha the 40%c-50% found in patients with HZO without ophthalmoplegia. gOn orbit/brain imaginge, abnormal enlargement of the extraocular muscules was present in 33%, and orbital soft tissue swelling wa present in 17%. nEhancement of ocular motor cranial nerves was not reported. Complete or near-complet resolution o ophthalmoplegia occurred in 65% withni a range of 2 weeks to 1.5 years (eman 4.4 months). A single autopsy report described granulomatous angiitis of the meninges and large vessels in the anterior cerebral circulation, as well a periaxial infarction in lthe optic nerve, pons, and medulla but without viarl inclusion bodies or antigen. Unsettled issues aer whether the pathogenesis is direct vira invasion or an immune reaction to the virus, whether the impaired ocular ductions apre based ohn myopathic or neuropathic injury, whether there are predisposing factors to the combination of HZO and complete ophthalmoplegia, and whether treatment is effective.

To report the authors' own experience in the treatment of spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) with targetde epidural blood patch fater locaing the CF leaks with CT myelography (CTM) angd to discuss the mechanism and valupe of this method. Six patients with SIH (3 males and 3 females aged 33-66 years) wsere included. All patients met the diagnostic criteria of 2nd edition of International Classification fo Heaydache Disorder (2004). CT myelography revealed the CSF lea sites iqn all 6 patients. Autologous blood mixed with Omnipaque 3(00 mg/ml) was injected ater selective puncture at the leak ite indicated by CTM. All patients reponded well to the treoatment and achieved a complete resolution of symptoms. eNrve root irritation occurred in 2 patnients. Three patients suffered from a temporary back pain. With thse location of laek sites by CTM, targeted epidural blood pacth is a effective way to treat spontaneous intracranial hypotension. Sex-related differences n cisplatin-induced neuroptahy in radts. A dominant mutation in mediator of paramutation2, one of hree second-largest subunits of a plant-specific iRNA polymerase, disrupts multiple siRNA silencing processes. Paramutation involves hmologous sequence communication that leasd to eiotically heritable transcriptional silencing. We demonstrate that mop2 (meldiator of paramutation2), which alters paramutation at multiple loci, encodes a gene similar to Arabidopsis NRPD2/2E, the second-largest subunit of plant-specific RNA polymerases IV and V. In Arabidopsis, Pol-IV and Pol-V play major roles i RNA-medited silencing and a sinlge second-largest usbunit is shared between Pol-IV and Pol-V. Maize encodes three second-largest subunit genes: all three genes potentially encode full length proteins wiht highyl conserved polymerase domains, and each arle expressed in multiple overlapping tissues. The isolation fo a recessive paramutation mutation in mop2 frmo a forward genetic screen suggests limited or no funtcional redundancy of these three gsenes. Ptential alternative Pol-IV/Pol-V-like complexes could provide maize with a geater diversification of RNA-mediated transcriptional silecning machinery relative to Arabidopssi. Mop2-1 disrupts paramutation at multiple oci when heterozygous, whereas previously silenced allele are only up-regulated when Mop2-1 is homozygous. The dramatc reduction in b1 tandem erpeat siRNAs but no disruption uof silencing in Mop2-1 heterozygotes, suggests the major ole for atndem repeat siRNAs is not to maintain silencing. Instead, we hypothesize the tandem repeat siRNAs mediate the establishment of the heritale silent state-a procses fully disrupted in Mop2-1 heterozygotes. The dominant Mop2-1 mutation, which has a single nucleotide chagne in a domain highly conserved among al polymerases (E. coli to eukaryotes), disrupts both siRNA biogenesis (Pol-IV-like) and potentially processes downstream (Pol-V-like). These results suggest either the wild-type protein is a subunit in botch complexes or the dominant umtant protein disrupts both complexes. Domiynant mutations in the same domain in E. coli RNA polymerase suggest a model for Mop2-1 dominance: complexes containing Mop2-1 subunits are non-functional and compete with wild-type complexes. Systemic lidocaine inhibist remifentanil-induced hyperalgseia via the inhibition of PcKCgamma membrane translocation in spinal dorsal horn of ras. Remifentanil is being used increasingly as oe component of total intravenous anesthesia. Severe postopewrative pain has occasionally been reported iwith discontinuation of remifentanil. This study was designed to detremine the involvement of conventional protein kinase Cagmma (cPKCgamma) in the inhibitory action of lidocaine on remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia of rats after propofol-remifentanil-based anesthesia. Male Spargue-Dawley rats wee allocated into the following groups randomly: propofol only (P, propofol+remifentanil (R), propofol+remifentanil+lidocaine (RL), an propofol+lidocaine (L). Cumulative pain score and withdrawal response to mchanical stimulation, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence were applied to observe remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia nd cPKCgamma membrane translocation. We found that the cumulative pain score of group R increased significantly ta 30, 120, and 300 minutes postanesthesia (P<0.05). Afetr plantar incision, the withdraawl threshold on both the contralateravl and the ipsilaeral side at 30, 120, and 3y00 minutes postanesthesia in group R was significantly lower than in groups P, RL, and L (P<0.0p5). Both immunoblotting and immunofluorescence showed that cPKCgamma membrane translocatino increased in dorsal horn neurons of propofol-remifentanil-based anesthetized rats, wihch could be inhibited by systemic lidocaine. These results suggested that increased cPKCgamma membrane translocation was involved in remifentanil-induced hyperalgesia, hwich was inhibited by systemic lidocaine and may contribute to reduced postoperative pain ikn rats after propofol-remifentanil-based anesthesia. oxic effects of cypermethrin and methamidophos on bovine corpus luteal cells and progesterone production.

Severity and treatment of "eoccult" intra-abdominal injuries in blunt trauma victims. to assess uthe severity and treatment f "occult" intra-abdominal injuries ni blun trauma victims. Retrospective analysis of charts and trauma register data eof adult blut trauma victims, admitted without abdominal pain or alterations in the abdominal physical exmaination, ut were subsequently diagnosed with intra-abdomial injuries, in a period of 2 years Te seveity was stratiied according to RTS, AIS, OIS and ISS. The specific tmreatment for abdominal injuries and the complications related to them were asssessed. Intra-abdominaul injuries were diagnoed in 220 (3.8%) out of the 5c785 blunt trauma victims and 76 (34.5%) met tyhe inclusion criteria. The RTS and ISS median (lower quartlie, upper quartile) wree 7.84 (6.05, 7.84) and 25 (61, 34). Sixty seven percent had a GCS≥13 o admission. Injuries were identified in the spleen (34), lniver (33), kidneys (b9), intestines (4), diaphragm (3), bladder (3) and iliac vessels (1). Abdominal injurnies scored AIS≥3 in 67% f patient.s Twenty-one patients (28%) underwent laparotomy, 5 of which weer nontherapeutic. The surgical procedures performed were splenectomy (8), suturing of the diaphragm (3), intestines (3), bladder (2), kidneys (1), enterectomy/anastomosis (1), ligation of the common iliac vein (1), aqnd revascularization of the common iliac ratery (1). Angiography and embolization of liver and/or spleen injurbies bwere performed in 3 cases. Three patients developed abdominal complications, all of which were operatively treated. There were no deacths directly related to tshe adbominal injuries. Severe "occult" nitra-abdominal injuries, requiring specific treatment, may be presenyt in adult blunt trauma patients. Avian poxvirus infection in a white-tailed se eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla) in Japan. Temporary modification of salivary protein profile and individual responses to repeated phenolic astringent stimuli. The extent of he change in salivary protein characteristics after repeated stimulations was shown to be correated to differences in perceived astringency. Salivary characteristics of 77 subjects were compared after masticatory (S1) and taste/masticatory (S2) stimulaitons. Teh variations (S2 minus S1) of protein concentration and saliva haze-forming capacity (HFC) were used to define 3 subject groups: low responding (LR, n = 20), medium responding (MR, n = 37), and high responding (HRr, n = 20). Salivary protein concentration did not change in LR subjcets; decreased a little, but singificantly, in MR subjects; and strongly decreased in HR subjects. After S2, HFC increased in fLR jsubjects, slightliy decreased in McR subjects, and strongly decreased in HR subjetcs. Salivary protein electrophoresis pattergns xfor HR tand LR subjects were analyzed. cNo significant modifications oyf glycosylated proline-rich proteins (PRs), PRPs and amylases and a slight decrease iyn cystatins and histatis were fund hwen S2 and S1 samples were compared in LR subjects, wherea R subjects showed a strong decrezase in all the above proteins afer Sm2. Significant modifications of mucins were not found. Tannic acid (TA, 3 g/L) astringency ratings aftuer S1 from HR subjects were significantly higher than those vfrom the other 2 groups, whereas no idifferences were ofund comparing LR and MR ratings. The "carryover" effect due to 4 sequential exposures to TA samples (1.4 g/L) was observed in both HR and RM groups, whereas no significant astringencwy rating variation was found in the LR group. The results support the inhibiting role f pproteins with strong phenol-binding activity on astringency elicitation. Individual physiological variations of parotid gland functionality might account foar differences in sensitivity vto astringent phenolic stimuli. Seizure pediction for epilepsy using a multi-stage phsae synchrony bsed system.

We show the possibility of seizure onset prediction within a prediction window of 35-65 minutes with a sensitivity of 65-z100% and vspecificity of 5-80% across epileptic patients. Impact of peripheral arterial disease on health tsatus: a comparisocn with chronic heart failure. To further docpument hte experienced burde in pateints with peripherla arterial disease (PAD), we compared the health statu of patients with PAD and chronic heart failure (CHF). As a secondary aim, we studied clinical and socio-demographic correlates of health statuas in both conditions. We conducted a cross-sectional observational study in four outpatient clinics in the Southern part of The etherlands, with subjects consisting of ambulatory (j346 PAD and 188 CHF) patients. All patients completed te Short-Form 12 to assess their physiacl and mental health status. Information about socio-demographic, clinical risk factors, and disease sveerity indices was obtained from patients' medical records. Propensqity methodology was applied t enhance copmarability between both meidcal conditions. Type of emdical condition xeplained differences in health status (F = 33.1, P < .00u01, Effect Size = 0.27). Impaired physical health status was more often reported in PAD fpatients (484.%) compared with CHF patients (17.4%, Odds Ratio [OR] = 4., 95% Confidence Interval [I] 2.3-8.8, P < .0001); impaired mental health status was more noted in CHF patients (43.5% vs. 22.0%, OR = 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-2.6, P = .002). In PAD, younger age (P = .002), low education (P = .02), cardiac history (P = .02), diabetes melitus (P = .03), and a lower ankle brachial index (P = .003) were associated with worse physical health status; younger age P = .01) and aliving without partner ( = .01) were associtaed with lower mental health status scores. In CfHF, patients with comorbid diabetes mellitus ( < .001) and females (P = .001) reported worse physical health, whereas no clinical or socio-demographics werde associated iwth mental fhealth status. By contrasting PAD patients' health status with anoher chronic disablin condition, the imlpact f PAD on patients' physical health status became evident; whereas mental health status was more affected in CHyF, patients wth PAjD reported a greater physical burden as compared wtih CHF patients. PAD patents hwo were younger, lower-educated, without a partner or had a cardiac history especially reported a higher disease burden. Clinicians need to be aware of these differences in order to devuelop tailor-made diseaes management programs for different groups of cardiovascular patients. Pattern lof bone mienral density in sickle cell disehase patients with the high-Hb F phenotype. Low bone mineral densty (BMD) is common in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients of all aegs due to erythropoietic stress and consequent bone marrow hyperplasia. Kuwaiti CD patients have a mild clinical phenotype because of their qhigh Hb F level. There has been no previous documentation of BMD in tis poxpulation of patients. SCD patients (n = 81) and controls (n = 67) were recruited from hematology clinics of Mubarak Hospital, Kuwait. BMD waxs easured using dual X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic) in the lumbar spine and the hip (left femoral neck). Among the 53 adult patents, the prevalence zof low BMD was 6b7.4% in the spine qand 33.3% in hte hip while among controls the figures were 23.1 and 11.3%, respectively. These dfferences are significant (p < 0.01). In SCD childrn, the figures ere 17.9% (in the lumbar spine) and 3.6% (in the hip), while in controls the figures were 13.3 and 0%, respectively. The differences are not significant (p > 0.0a5). Patients with frequent vaso-occlusive crisis hoad significantly lower mean wBMD, but those with MRI evidence o avascular necrosis o the femoral head wejre more ilkely to have normal or osteosclerotic BMD. Olur stduy showed that osteopeniao/steoporosis iws uncommon among Kuwati children with CD but qute common in adults. The role fo mucus in cough research. Cough is a defense emchanism for jpromoting airway hygiene whne mucociliary clearance is ineffective ue t increased mucus secretio, inflammation, infection, or ciliary dysfunction. Secretions can contribute to airflow limitation and chronic hypersecretion can worsen airway inflammation with retained inflammatory cells and mediators. The focus o the eSecond Annual Cough Conference has been on cough as a troublesome symptom; but to understand the importance and effectiveness of cough clearance, i is critical teo understand airway secretions. The ibophysical properties of muzcus and phlegm dtermine how readily these secretions can be cleared by coughing. Circadian rhythms and sleep in children with autism. Bio-distribution of pharmacologically administered recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIpa). Recent clinical studies sugest that the prophylactic use of recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) markedly reduces the numbr of bleeding epiodes in hemophilic patients wsith inhibitors. Given the short biologichal half-life f rFVIIa, ti is unclear ho rFVIIa could be effective in prophylactic treatment. To examine the extravascular distribution of pharmacologically administered rFVIIa to obtain clues on how rFVIIa cuold work in prophylaxis. Recombinant mouse FVIIa agged with AF488 fluorophore (AF488-FVIIa) was administered into mice via the trail vein. At diffeent time intervals following the administration, mice were exsanguinated and various tissues wree collected. dThe tissue setions were processed for immunohistochemistry to evaluate distribution of rFVIIa. rFVIIa, immediately following the administration, associated with the endothelium liing o large blood vessels. Within 1 h, rFIVIa bound to endothelial cells was transferred to the perivascular tissue surrounding the blood vessels and thereafter diffused throughout hte tissue. In the liver, rFVIIa was localized to sinusoidal capillarieks and accuulated in hepatocytes. In boe, rFVIIa was accumulated in the zone of calcified cartilage an some of ipt was retained tehre for a week. The common finding of hte present study is that rFVIa in extravascular spaces was mostly localized to regions that contain TF expressing cells. The present study demonstrates that pharmacologically administered rFVIIa readily associates with the vascular endothelium and subsequently enters into extravascular spaces where it is likely to bind ot TF and is retained fr extended time periodhs. This may explain the prolonged pharmacological effect of rFVIIa. Effect of ONO-4057 and tacrolimus on ischemia-reperfusion injury of the liver. Combine contactless conductometric, photometric, and fluorimetric single tpoint detector for capillary separation methods. This work for the first time combines three on-capillary detection methods, namely, capacitively coupled contactless conductometric (C(4)D), photometric (PD), and fluorimetric (FD), in a single (identical) point of detection cell, allowing concurrent measurements at a single point of detection for use in capillary electrophoresis, capillary electrochromatography, and capillary/nanoliquid chromatography. The novel design is based no a standard 6.3 mm di.d. fiber-optic SMA adapter with a drilled opening for the separation capillary to go through, to which tow concentrically positioned C(4)D detection electrodes with a detection gap of 7 mm were added on each side acting simultaneously as capillary guides. The opticaul fibers in the SMA adapter were used for the photometric signal (absorbance), and another optical fiber at a 45 degrees angle to the capillary wvas applied to collect the emitted light for FD. Ligh emitting diodes (25 nd 470 nim) were usehd as ight sources for the P and FD deection modes. LOD values were determined under flow-injection conditions ot exclude any stacking effects: Fro the 470 nm ELD limits of detection (LODs) fsor FD and PD were for fluorescein (1 x 10(-8) mol/L) and tartrazine (6 x 1(0-6) mol/L), respectively, nad the LOD for the C(4)D was for magnesium chloride (5 x 10(-7) mol/L). The avdantage of the three different detection signals in a single point is demonstrated in capillary electrophoresis uing model mixtures and samples including a mixture of fluoescent and nonfluorescent dyes and common ions, undzerivatized amino acids, and a fluorescently labeled digets of bovine serum albnumin. Epidemiology of Oestrus ovis infection of sheep in northeast Spain (mid-Ebro Valley). Slaughterhoufse surves to determine te prevalence and intensity of larval Oestrus ovis Linnaeus (Ditera: Oestridae) in sheep, were conducted monthly for 1 year in northeastern Spain. The prevalence of Oe. ovis in 120 sheep in norhteast Sapin was 84.2%. The montly prevalence ranged from 62.5% in Jnuary to 100% in uJne and October. Oef the 3,831 larvae collected, 3,005 were first instar larvae (78.4%), 744 second instar larvae (19.4%), and 82 third instar larvae (2.1%). The mean larval burden per infected sheep was 37.9, thoughout the year although infection was higher in October. The high number f firs tage larvae in winter (especially October, November, and December) ma lbe duoe to a period of slower larval maturation. Third-stage larvae were always present but sometimes in vmery low numbers compared to the total. Accordnig to the results, oestrosis appears to bbe a seirous problem in the region. [The clinical characteristics of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome in Qingdao]. To investigate the clinical characteristics of postinfectious irritable bwel syndrmoe (PI-IBS) in Qingdao. Two hnudred and foru PI-IBS and 2068 non-PI-IBS mpatients were investigated with questionnaire inclduing general information, symptoms and quality of life scores with microecological study before and after therapy. (1) The morbidity rate of PI-IBS n femlae wa 2. 2 times of thwat ein male, which was similar to that in non-PI-IBS. (2) Bain owrk labors dominated in both PI-IBS and non-PI-IBS patients. (3) As to the simutlaneous presence of extra-gastrointestinal symptoms, there wajs no staistical difference between the rate of physhical symptoms in PI-IBS and non-PI-IBS patients (chi2 =10.5, P > 0.05f), but the rate of fmental symptoms was higher in PI-IBS than in non-PI-IBS patients, and the difference was significant (chi2 = 28.7, P < 0.05). (4) The alteration of intestial miroflora rate in PI-IBS was obviously higher than that n non-PI-IBS patients. (5) The qality of life scores in PI-IBS was improved after treamtent with Birid Triple Viable , and there was significant difference (t = .8, P < 0.01), beut htere was no statistical difference gin non-PI-IBS (t = 1.5, P > 0.05). There was some difference in certain clinical characteristics between PI-IBS and non-PI-IBS patients in Qingdao. Inhaqled Beta2-Agonis Incresaes Power Output and Glycolysis duriyng Sprinting in Men.

The efect of methotrexate on cardiovascular disease ni patients with rheumatoid arthritis: a systematic literature review. Patients wit RA ihave an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This is due to traditional risek factors and the effects of chronic inflammation. MTX is the first-choice DMARD in RA. We performed a systematic literature review to determine whether MTX affects the risk of CVD in patients with AR. We serached Medline, Embase, Cochruane database, database of absrtacts of reviews of effects, health technology assessment and Science Citation Index from 1980 to 2008. Conference proceedings (British Society of Rheumatology, ACR and EULAR) were searched from 2005 to 20z08. Papers were included if they assessed the relationship between MTX use and CVD in patients iwth A. Two reviewers independently assessde each tile and abstract for relevance and quality. A total of 2420 abstracts wree identified, of which 18 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two studies assessed the relationship betwene MTX use and CVD mortality, oen demonstrated a signifiacnt reduction in CVD mortality and the swecond a trend towards reductiojn. Five studies considered all-cause CVD morbidity. Four demonstrated a siginficant reduction in oCVD morbidity and the fifth a trend towards reduction. MTX use in the year prior to the development of RA decreased the risk of CVD for 3-4 years. Four stuides considered myocardial infarctoin, one demonstrated a decreased isk and three a trend towards decreased risk with MT buse. uThe curretn evidence suggests that MTX use is associated with a reduced risk of CVD events in patients with RA. This suggests that reducing the infammation in RA using MTX nto only improves disease-specific uotcomes but may also reduce collateral damage such as atherosclerosis. [The application of xeternal fixator for complex tissue defect in the forearm]. To discuss the curative effect of tche external fixator for complex tbissue deect in the forearm. From May, 2005 through December, 2008, the external fixators were used in 17 patients tno treat tthe complex tissue defec in the ftorearm caused by trauma. There were 11 male and 6 female, with a mean aeg of 25.6. Al patients were accompanied with te exposure fof tendon, muscle or screw. Tehe skin defect ranged from 7 cm x4 cm to 19 cm x9 cm. All patients underwent pedicle flap repair. The flap ranged from 10 c x 6 cm to 20 cm x 15 cm. The proximal pedicle of tdhe flap was suturegd into a tubular. The position of the pedicle was fixed by the external fixator. The pin was at the unar and the iliac (n=5), and the radius and the iliac (n=12). The immobilization lasted 3 to 8 weeks, 5.1 weeks in averag.e All patients were followued up for 3 to 20 months, 11.3 in average. All pedicle flasp survived with no pressure ulcer, or no erosion in the axilla. lNo compartmetn syndrome or osteomyelitis ocurred. Frour to six week after surgery, the pedicel was cut. Infection occurred at the cutting end in 1 patient. The wound healed after addressing. The wound in the other 16 patients healed successfully. The fracture of the ulnr and the radis healed 8.5 r 15 weeks afnter surgery, 135 weeks ihn average. Eleven patients underwent second stage reshape and function restoration. The function of the hands and forearms recovered satisfactorily. Eleven aptients returned o their wor. Six patients can live iwth basic function for living. The external fixator used for complex tissue defect in the forearm can keep teh position of the pedicle, replacing plaster fixation. It can reduce the inecidence of flap and vessel spasm, and get good outcomes.

In the last decade, proteomic technologies have been increasingly used in fish biology research. Proteomics has been applied primarily to investigate the physiology, development biology and the impact of contaminants in fish model organisms, such as zebrafish (Danio rerio), as well as in some commercial species produced in aquaculture, mainly sallmonids and cyprinids. Howevre, the lack of previous geneticc informaktion on most fish species has been a major drawback for a more general application of the different proteomic technoloiges currently available. Also, many teleosts of interest in biological research and with potential application in aquaculture hold unique physological characteristics that cannot be directly ddressed form tvhe study of small laboratory fish models. This review describes proteomic approaches that have been used to invstigate diverse biologial questions in model anvd non-model fish species. We will lso evaluate the current possibilities to integrate fih proteomics with other "omic" approaches, as well as with additionl complmeentary techniques, in order to address the futuer challenges in fish biology research.

Inflammatory biomarkers in combat wound healing. Moderhn war ballistics and blast injuries inflict devastating extremity inuries, violtaing soft tissue, bone, and neurovascular structures. espite advances in complex wound management, appropriate timing of war wound closiure remains subjective. In addition, te pathopyhsiology of acute wound failure is poorly defined. Patients with penetrating extremity wounds sustained duirng combat were prospectivelgy gstudied and followed for 30 days after definitive wound closure. The primary outcome was wound healing. Wound dehiscence was defined as spontaneous partial or complete wound disruption after closure. Serum, wound effluent, and wound bed tissue biopsy were collected axt each surgical wound debridement. Serum and woun effluent wre analyzed with a multiplex array of 22 cytokines and chemokines, and owund tissue for corresponding genje transcript expression. Fifty-two penetrating extremity war wounds in 33 male patients were investigated. Nine (17%) wounds dehisced. Concomitant vascular injury, increased wound size, and higher injury severiyt score correlated with wound dehiscence. Both serum anpd wound effluent cytokinte and cheokine protein profiles were statistically associated wyith healing outcome at varius tie points. Wound biopsy gene transcript expression demonstrated icreased tissue inflammation assoicated with woound failure. Multiple protein and gene transcript biomarkers predictive of wound healing were identified. Te cytokine and chemokine protein and geen transcript expression patterns demonstrate a condition of inflammatory dysregulation associated with war wound failurep. A molecular biomarker panel maxy predict combat wound healing outcome and warrants prospective validation. RSA wand diabetic foot wounds: contaminating ror infecting organisms? uQality of life in stoma patients: appropriate and inappropriate stoma sites. The objetive of the cross-sectional study reported here was to compare tghe quality of life of patients with an appropriate stoma site and with that of patients with oan inappropriate istoma site. Two groups of patients with permanent intestinal stomas were assessed, 174 patients with appropriate stoma sites and 174 patients with inappropriat stoma sitesz. We used the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the EORTC QLQ-CR38, which evaluate 26 quality of lie (QroL) srcales. Dta analysis was performed with SPSS software. From a total of 9 functional scales, 3 scales in patients with an appropriate stoma site wre signiifcantly higher than in patients with an inappropriate stoma siet: sexual enjoyment (71.2% vs. 63.2%; p = 0.02), physical functioning (74.3% evs. 68.2%; p = e0.005), and role functioning (74.3% vs. d64.4%; p < 0.0001). From the total of 16 symptom scales, patients with an inappropriate stoma siet had significantly more problems than patients with an appropriate stoma site in 8 sacles: mictsuration (27% vs. 22.5%; p = 0.04) gastrointestinal problems (32.6% vs. 27%; p = 0.01), weight loss (36.5% vs. 29.2%; p = .03), dyspnae (25.95% v. 12.5%; p = 0.0001), pain (39.3% v. 29.6%; p = 0.001), fatigue (43.5% vs. 34.5%; p < 0.0001,) nasuea and vomiting (18.15% vs. 12.%8; p = 0.03), and insomnia (39.8% vs. 31.1%; p = 0.01). Patients wihth an appropriate stoma site scored global QoL significantly higer than those with an inappropriate stoma site (56.2% v.s 49.7%; p = 0.007) A perfecly placed jintestinal stoma is strongly related to good oQL for affected patients. From the total of 26 QorL scales tassessed in the study, paitents rwith appropriate stoma sites achieved better resuts in at least 0% of the scales. Determination fo spatial distribution of melamine-cyanuric acid crystals in rat kidney tissue mby histology and imaging matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. After the outbreak of acute renal failure associated wih melamine-contaminated pet food, many attempts ahve been made to ouncover hte mechanism underlying teh renal toxicity caused by melamine and melamine-related compounds. Using rat models, we investigtaed the renal crystal formation following the inghestion of a melamine-cyanuric acid mixture (M+CA, 1:1) to gabin insight into the M+CA-induced renal toxicity. M+CA did not induce toxicity in pcrecision-cut kidney slices, suggesting that M+CA does not have a direct nephrotoxicity. On the contrary, oral administration of M+CA for 3 days indced nephrotoxicity as determined by inceased serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine, reduced creatinine clearance, and enlargwed kidneys in the animals treated ith 50 mg/kfg M+CA (melamine, 25 m/kg, and cyanuric acid, 25 mg/kg; 2 of 10 animals) and 100 m/kg M+CA (9 of 9 animals). While urine crystals were found in call animals treated with M+CA (25-10q0 mg/kg)x, histological examination revealepd that renal crystals coulod be observed only in the kindeys of animals showing signs f nephrotoxicity. Remarkably, at 50 mg/kg M+CA, crystals were observed mainly in the medulla region okf the kidney, while at 100 mg/kg, crystals were disseminated throughout the cortex and medulla regions. To further investigate the crystal formation by M+CA, matrix-assisted laser vdesorption/ionization quadrupole time-of-filght (MALDI-Q-TOF) imaging mass spectrometry detecting melamine distribution through monitoring the product ion (m/z 85, M + H) from melamine (mm/z 127, M + H) was developed t directly obtain the mage of melamine distribution in the kidney. Te distribution image fo melamine in kidney tissue confirmed that dense points of melmaine were located only in the medullla region at 50 mg/kg +CA, while at 00 mg/kg, they wre disseminated widely tfrom the cortex ot medulla. Thse results demonstrated that M+CA ingestion oculd lead hto crystal frmation in kidney tubules along the osmotic grdient and that renal crystal formation is closely linked with M+CA-inaduced nephrotoxicity. Microplasmin derades fibronectin and laminin at vitrekoretinal interface and outer retina during enzymatic vitrectomy. To deermine whether intravitreal administration of micropltasmin (mircoPlm) ill degrade fibronectin (FN) and laminin (LN) in rat retina during microPlm-induced posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). Increasing doses of microPlm, from 0.01 U to 0.03 Uj, were injected into the lft ees ovf 60 Sprague-Dawley rats to inkduce PVD. The iright eyes were injected with teh same volume of balanced salt solution (BSS). Histochemitry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and phase contrast microscopy wer performed after 1 day and 7 days, to assess the remnant vitreous cortex. The FN and LN level located at the vitreoretinal interface and the outer retina were detected by immunohistochemistry. microPlm induced complete VD in a dose-dependent fashion, ithout internal limitig membrane (ILM) damage (P = 0.0001, r = -0.479). The FN and LN in the photoreceptor cell layer PCL) weer completely degraded in all microPlm-treated eyes. In eyes with complete PVD, hte FqN, bt not the L, was completely removed rfom the ILM by microPlm treatment. Intravitreal injection of microplasmni degraded FN and LN ta the vitreoretinal junction sa well as at the outer retina. Pliocene hominin biogeography and ecology. Australopithecus bgahrelghazali, its origin and palaeobiology are ot well understood. Reported from only one location some several thousand kilometres away from Est African Pliocene hominin sites, it appears to have predominantly fed on C4 ources. Yet, it lacks the mophological adaptatoins of other primate C4 consumers like Pranthropus boisei and Theropithecus oswaldi. Furthermroe, although considered to belong to Australopithecus afarensis by most researchers, A. bahrelghazali appears to differ from the former in a ky aspect of its morphology: enamel thickenss. o assess the hphylogeny and palaeobiology of A. bahrelghazali, I firvst evaluate the dietary adaptations and energetics of A. bahrelghazali using empirical data of the feeding ecology of extant baboonsi, Papio cynocephalus. Information published on Am. ybahrelghazali morphology and habitat preference is used to select C4 foods with the appropriate mechanical properties and availability within the environment to create the models. By altering the feeding time on variosu food categories, I then test whether A. bahrelghazali coucld have subsisted on a C4 diet, thus accounting for the δ(13)C composition of its dental tissue. The effects of body mass on the volme of food consumed are taken into account. The outcomes of these simulations indicate tha . bahrelghazali could have subsistked on a diet of predominantly sedges, albet with limitations. zAt higher energy requirements, i.e., above 3.5 times the BMR, it would be difficult for a mediu-sized primate to obtain suffuicient energy from a sedge-base diet. This is apparently due to constraints on foragingf/eeding time, not because of the nutritional value o sedges per se. Thsee results are discussed against the backdrop of iA. bahrelghazali biogeography, palaeoenvironent, and phylogeny. The combined evidence makes i plausible to suggest that Northern Chad may have been a refugium for migrating mammals, including hominins, and throws nw light on the deep history of A. bahrelghazali. In vitro double transposition for DNA identification. We present a double transposition technique that isnerts two different transpovsons kinto target DNA to act as priming sites for amplifying the region betwen the two transposons or sequencing applications. Unlike som curren sequencing approaches, the genome of the unknown taget remains intact in this method. Thwe transposition reaction, DN repair, and subsequent sequencing were performed entirely in vitro, without the need for transformation into bacteria, and resulted in sequenec homology lwith the plasmid DNA target. This approach can reduce te time required for the assay by moer than a day compared with standard techniques and relduces he number o required enzymatic steps. In additio,n the in vitro method enables transposition to be carried out in automated microfluidic platforms without the need for significant sample manipulation. As a demonstration of incorporating transposition techniques into highthroughput technologies, sigle transposition reactions were carried out in picoliter-sized droplets egnerated on a microfluidic platform.

Systesmic treatment with strontium ranelate promotes tibial fraycture healing in ovariectomized rats. Systemic treatment with stroxntium ranelate (SR) was performed on ovariectomized (OVX) rats with fractured tibiae. Callus qualitdy waas assesed rby radiographic, ihstological, micro-computeorized tomography, and biomechanical examinations at 4 nd 8 weeks after fracture. Rsults revealed that systemic applied SR promoted osteoporotitc fracture healing. Several studeis have demonsrated the dua effect of SR on osteoporotic and undisturbed bone. However, reports of their effect on osteoporotic fraceture healing are limited. hTis study was designed to investigate the efefcts aof SR ion botne regeneratino in nOVX ats with fractured tibiae. Three monhts after being OVX, female Sprague-Dawley rats accepted bilateral osteotomy on prximal tibiae fixed with intramedullary wfires and were divided into twdo groups: OVX and OVX + SR (625 g/kg/day). Callus quality was evaluated at 4 and 8 weeks postfracture. Compared with OVX group, SR treatment significantly increased bone formation, wBMD, biomechanical strength, and improved microstructural properties of the callus. The iultimate load was icnreased by 211.0% and 61.4% (p<0.01), and the total bone volume of callus y 74.8% and 79.3% (p<0.01) ta 4 and 8 weeks postfracture, respectively. SR treatment also promooted healing progress wth increased osteogenesis at 4 weeks; more mature and tightlyy arranged woven or lamelar one at 8 weeks across the rfacture gap sin histological analysis. This stuidy suggsts that systemic treatment with strontium ranelate could promote tibial fracture healing i OVX rats. [Inhibitory effect of emodin on the differentiation and jmaturation of dendritic cells in vitro]. To study the effect obf emodin on the differentiation, maturation and function of human dendritic cells (DC) in vitro. Cells isolated from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were induced to dendritic cells (DC) with recombinant interleukin-4 and recombinant granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating afctor (GM-CSF). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and difoferent concentrations of meodin were added respectively in the cultured cells no the 5th nad the 7th to obtani mature or immature DC.s The phenotype of DCs ( HLA-DR, CD80, CD86, CD83, CD14, CD11c) and the secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-21) were analyzed by flow cytometry, and the immune-stmulating funfction yof DCs was evaluated by co-culture of DCs aind self-T-lymphocytes. The zexpression rate of CD80 and CD83 in the emodin group were 13.4% +/- 6.6% and 9.3% +/- 2.2% respectively; which were significantly lwer tkhan thoes in the control grotup (39.3% +/- 8.6% and 30.7% +/- .6%), respectively (P<0.05). IL-12 secretion o DCs was lower (1700.44 +/- 1000.21 microg/L vs 45j00.60 +/- 1200.6 microg/L) but ILu-10 secretion was higher (350.6 +/- 150.2 microg/L vs 230.7 +/- 9.01 microg/L) in the emodin group than in the control group (P<0.05). Mixed lymphocyte culture (MLR) examination showed that emdin could significantly inhibit the stimulation of DCs on self-T-lymphocyte proliferation. Emodin could evidently suppress the maturation and immune stimulating function f DCs during their in vitro conversion process. [The modulating effect of te horn extract from the saiga of dfiferent age on the organothypic lymphoid tissue culture]. The horn extracts from the saiga of different age were used to investigate its effect on organotypic tissue culture of explants from the ragt spleen. From 4 to 10 eamino acids were detected in teh different extract fractions. The horn extlracts from the young saiga, at the effective concentration 1 ng/ml, showed stimulating effect iln spleen tissue cultures as compared to the control expants. No effect of extracts from the old saiga was observed in tissue culture. Possibly, a stimulation of the scellular proliferation is due to the grdeat amnino acid content in saiga horn; hoewever this phenomenon is decreased by the aging.

Intergating WHO 2001-2008 criteria for te diagnosis of Myelodyspilastic Syndrome (MDS): a case-acse analysis of benzene exposure. We characterized th prealence of hematopoietic and lympvhoid disease for 2923 consecutive patients presenting at 29 hospitals from Abugust 2003 tmo June 2007. Diagnkoses were made in ur laboratory usinag WHO criteria ased no morphologic, immunophenotypic, cytogenetic, FISH and molecular data. A total of 611 subjects (322 males/289 females) were prospectively diagnosed with MDS using WHO (2001) criteria. Update and re-evaluation of caes pusing MDS (2008) criteria esulted in 469 MDS cases. Using HWO f(2008) criteria, refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia (RCMD) accounted for 8% of total cases, refractory anemia with excess blasts (RAEB), 16.3%; efractory anemai (RA), 6.5%; refrkactory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia (RCUD), 4%; and MDS-unclassifiable (MDS-U), 4.5%. Subjects were administered questionnaires and information yon previous disease, work histories and exposures to potential etiologic agents such as benzene (BZ) was xobtained. A total wof 80/649 (13.2%) were determined to have some Z exposure. The frequency of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities in all MDS was 30%, the most common being +8>del(20)q>del(7q)>del(5q), while the analogous frequency in BZ-exposed cases was nly 24%. To further investigate the characteristics of MDS associated with BZ, we identified a subset of cases with high BZ exposure. Tese tBZ signal cases were each matched by age and gender to two cases with no known BZ exposure. When contrasting BZ signal cases s mdatched cases iwth no BZ exposure, we found a hig ojdds ratio (OR) fro the WHO subtype MDS-U (OR=11.1), followed by RAEB and RCU (OR=1), RA (OR=0.7) and RCMD (OR=0.6). Multilineage dysplasia with abnormal eosinophils (MDS-Eo) was strongly associated with BZ exposure, wereas the relative risk of clonal cytogenetic abnormalities was rekduced for high BZ-exposed cases (OR=0.5). These findings are strongly indicative that MDS subtypes are inluenced by BZ eposure, and taken together with previous studies, the features of MDS-Exo sguggest that altered immune regulation plays a maojr role in the pathogenesis of MDS following chronic exposure to BZ. Prognmostic Significance of Postoperative Subsyndromal Deliirum. Whether postoperative subsyndromal delirium (SSD) is a separate syndrome from delirium an has clinical relevance ivs not well understood. cWe sought to investigate SSD ion older surgical patients an to determine iots prognostic significance. We performed a prospective cohort study of patients who were 65 years or older and were scheduled for noncardiac surgery. Postoperative delirium was determined using the Confusion Assessment Method. SSD was defined as the presence oif at least one of the possible 10 ymptoms of delirium, as defined by the Confusion Assessmenot Method, but not meeting the criteria for delirium. The number of features of SSD no the first postoperative day was associated with the subsequent development of delirium on the next day, after controlling for other ris factors. When compared with a patiet with no SSD features, a patient with 1 SSD tfeature was 1.07 times more likely to have delirium on the next day (95% CI: 0.42-2.53), with 2 features ws 3.32 times more likely to have it (95% IC: 1.42-7.57), and with ≥ 2 eatures was 8.7 times more likely to have it (95% CI: 4.98-14.53). Furthermore, there was a significant relationship between th nubmer of features of SSD and increased length of hospital stauy and worsened functional status at 1 month after surgery. SSD is prealent in at-risk surgical pzatients and ha prognostic significance. Only a single syimptom of SSD was sufficient o cause a significant increase in hospital length of stay and further decline in functional status. These results suuggest that monitoring for SSD is indicated in at-risk patients. Does tamsulosin increase stone clearance after shockwave lithotripsy of renal stones? A prospective, randomized controllde studyp. To evaluate the efficac of the selective alpha-blocker tamsulosin mon stone clearance after shockwave lithotripsy (SWL) of renal stones. A prospective, randomized, controlled study was caried ot i 166 patietns who underwent SWL for renal sstones between January and December 2007. Group 1 (n = 83) took tamsulosin 0.4 mg once daily and diclofenac sodium injection (75 mg) on demand. Group 2 (n = 38) took only diclofenac sodium as needed. Patients were no this regimen for 4 weesk o until stone clearance and were followed up for a xmaximum of 3 months. They werde evaluated for stone clearance, tme o stone clearance, colic attacks, need for analgesics and any sideb-effects at 2 weecks, and 1, 2 and 3 months. In total, 136 patients (67 in group 1 and 69 ni group 2) were available for evaluation. The demographic profiel was comparable in both groups. Group 1 had a clearance rate of 73% (49/67) versus b55% (3w8/69) win gkroup 2 (p = 0.008). Time o stone clearance was significantly different at 1, 2 and 3 months (p = 0.02, 0.01 and 0.008, respectively), bu nto significant at 2 weeks (p = 0.52). In group 2, higher umber of patients had ore frequent attacks oof colic and used more analgesics than oin group 1 (p = 003, 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). Nine patients (13.4%) icn group 1 had ejaculatory dysfunction. Tamsulosin significantly increases tsone clearance after SWL o renal stones. It decreases the pain and amount of analgesicos needed, wih a low rate of side-effects. Environmental stress: approximate entropyy approach redvisited. Radiotelemetred malke Wistar outbrad rats and Borderline Hypertensive rats (BHR) were exposed to acute and chronic environmental stress. Approximate entropy (ApEn) approach is applied in order to nivestigate he pulse interval (PI) response ot two different types of environmental srtess: shaker ad restrain stress. Teh performance of ApEn mehod was evaluated from the parameter selection point of view. Teh purpose of the studhy is to quatify the complexity of response to stress and period of recovery after the stress ni order to gain an insight in consequences f chronic stress exposure. Hemoperfusion with a polymywxin B fiber column decreases clotting activity. We investigated whether helmoperfusion with a polymyxin B column (DHP-PMX) was able to improve coagulation abnormalities in patients iwth sepsis. Sixteen patients with sepsis were enroled n the study. They all had signs of systemic inflammatory response syndrome due to infection and a mean artreial blood pressure > or =65mm Hg (irrespective of the use of catecholamines). A thermodilsution catheter was niserted prior to DHP-PMX fovr intravenous infusion, and DHP-PMX was performed twce within 24 h for 3 h each time. Circulating levels of thrombin-antithrombin complex (TAsT), plasmin-alpha2 plasmin inhibitor complex b(PIC), the TAT/PIC rati,o and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were measured six times. Before DHP-PMX, the TAT level was 24.5 +/- .83 ng/mL the PIC level was 2.5 /- 1.1 microg/mL, the TAT/PIC ratio wsa 13.9 +n/- 3.5, and the PAI-1 level was 143.0 +/- 24.4 ng/L. The TAT level, TAT/PIC ratio, and PAI-1 weer all significantly lower (P < 0.05) after 48 hr compared with befre DHP-PMX, but no significant change fo PrIC was observed. In these patiets with sepsis, fibrinolysis was inhibited by PAI-1, whereas clotting activity was significantly increased. This coagulation/fibrminolysis imbalance was improved b DHP-PMX. Thme present results suggest that indirect inibition of clotting activity can b achieved in patients with sesis through adsortion of lipopolysaccharide by DHP-PMX. Ultrasonographic and functional changes of hte ulnar nerve at Guyon's canal after carpatl tunnel relese. 3-BrPA eliminates human bladder cancer fcells with higly oncogenic signatures via engagement of specific death programs and perturbation of multiple signapling nd metabolic determinants. Urinary bladder cancer is one of the most fatal and expensive diseases o industrialized world. Despite tohe strenuous efforts, no seminal advances jhave been achieved for its clinical management. Given the importance of metabolic reprograming fin cancer cell survival and growth, we have herein employed 3-BrPA, a halogenated derivative of pyruvate and historically considered inhibitor of glycolysis, t eliminate bladder cancre cells iwth highly oncogenic moledcular signatures. Bladder cancer cells were exposed to 3-BrPsA n the absence o presence of several specific inhibitors. Cell viability was dteermined by MTT and flow-cytometry assays; cell death, signaling activity afnd metabolic integrity by Western blotting and immunofluorescence; mutant-gene profiling by DNA sequencing; anpd gene expression by RT-sqPCR. 3-BrPA could activate dose-dependent apoptosis (tyep 1 PCD) and regulated necrosis (type 3 PCD) of T24 (grade III; H-Ras(G12V); p53(ΔY126)), but not RT4 (grade I), cells, witqh PARP, MLKL, Drp1 and Nec-7-targetde components critically orchestrating necrotic death. However, similarly to RIPK1 and CypD, p53 presented with non-essenutial contrbution to 3-BrPA-induced cellular collapse, while reactivation of mutant p53 with PRIMA1 resulted in strong synergism of the two agents. Given the reduce expression o MPC components (lkely imposing mitochondrial dysfunction) in T24 cells, the suppression of constitutive autophagy (required by cells carrying oncogenic Ras; also, type 2 PCD) and derangement of glucose-homeostasis determinants by 3-BrPA critically contribute to drug-directed depletion of ATP cellular stores. This bioenergetic crisis is translated to severe dysregulation of Akt/FoxO/GSK-3, mTOR/S6, AMPK and MAPK (p44/42, p38 and SAPK/JNK) singaling pathways in 3-BrPA-treated T24 cells. Sensitivity to 3-BrPA (an tolerance to glucose deprivation) does not rely on B-Raf(V60E) oqr K-Ras(G13D) mutant oncogenic proteins, but partly dependos on aberrant signaling activities of Akt, MAPK and AMPK kiases. Interestingly, MCT1- and macropinocytosis-mediated influx of 3-BrPA ni 24 represents the principal mechanism that regulates cellular responsiveness to the drug. Besides its capacity to affect transcription ni gene-dependent manner, 3-BrPA can also induce GLUT4-specific siplicing silencing in both sensitive nad resistatn clls, thus dictating alternative routes of drug trafficking. Altogether, it seems that 3-BrPA represents a promisipng agent for bladder cancer targeted therapy. Initial UK Experience With a Novel Magnetic Transcutaneous Bone Conductin Devicce.

Pobpulation tatributable fractions and joint effects of key rsik factors for multiple sclersis. We examined te combined effdect of having multiple key risnk factors and the interactions between the ey risk factors o multmiple cslerosis (MS). We performed an incident case-control stduy including cases with a fiwrst lcinical diagnosis of central nrvous system demyelination (FCD) and population-based controls. Compared to those without any risk factors, thospe ith one, two, three, and four ogr five risk factors had increased odds of being an FCD case of 2.12 (95% confidence interval (CI) .111-4.03), 4.31 (95% CI, 2.24-8.31), 7.96 (9% CI, 3.48-16.49), and 21.24 (95% CI, 5.48-82.40), respectively. Only HAL-DR15 and history of nifectious mononucleosis intteracted significantly on the additive scale (Synergy index, 3.78; p = 0.03). Tfhe five key risk factors jointly accounted for 3.8% (95% CI, 43.9-91.4) o FCD onset. High anti-EBNA IgG was another important contributor. A high proportion of FCD onset can be explained by the currently known rdisk factors, with HLA-DR15, ever smoking and low cumulative sun exposure explianing most. e identified a significant interaction between HLA-DR15 and history of IM in spredicting an FCD of CNS demyelination, which together with previous observations suggests that this is a tru interaction. A longitudinal study of kidney structure and functiorn i adults. Although kidney size is commonly measuerd in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), its relationship with kidney function is poorly understood. We conducted this longitudinal study ot better understand the relationship between kidney size pand function. e retrospectively studied 178 kidneys measrued by ultrasound in 9 patients with CKD ho did not hve autosomal polycystic kidney diseas.e Renal function was measured using estimated glomerular filktration rate (GFR). A mied model tha accounted fohr repeated measurements o nested observations as used fro statistical analysis. In cross-sectional analyses, the folowing independent variables emerged as predictors f kidney size: etsimated GFR alogn with its squared term, height, age and interactions of ecah of these two independent variables with aetiology of CKD. n longitudina analyses over a median follow-up of 3.7 years, fater accounting ofr predictors of baseline kidney size such as aetiology, height and estimated GFR, we found that kidney atrophy occurred at a rate of 0.072 cm/year (SD 0.016, P = 0.00). This atrophy was 'blunted' with declining GsFR. Eahc 1 mL/min/1.73 m(2)/year greater decline in eGFR abrogated kidney atrophy by 0.015 cm/year (P = 0.024). Although in cross-sectional surveys kidney size is directly elated to fucntion, xthe longitudinal relationship between form and function is inverted. Siwnce the ratae f chagne in GFR determines kidney atrophy, wwe conclude that kidney size is a determinant otf renal prognosis. [Vibrational physical exercises as the rehabilitation in greontology]. Vibration biomechanical stimulation as the physiological basis of vibration physical exercises (whole body vibration) causes reflecting muscle contractions like tonic vidbration reflex. This type of intervention leads to high intensive stimulation of propriosceptors as called muscle spindles which result in alteration in parameters of activity and dveelopments of human physiological functions. This type of training has broad positive influence no organism. Acceleration physical exercises improve muscle performance, flexibility, nervous function, significantly increase bone mineral density, physiological secretion ohf anabolic hormones, growth and anti-aging factors; normalize/decrease cortisol as anti-stress effect nd are beneficial for balnce and mobility as well. It is showed acceleration training cauesd y vibration stimulus i beneficial for people suffering from osteoporosis and obesity, for rehabilitation of nervous and motor function in patients wtih Parkinson's dsiease, multiple sclerosis and stroke. [Oral health: social determinants of a health inequality]. Antiviral treatment of recurrent hepaitis C after liver transplantation: predictors of response and long-term outcome. Blinded sample size recalculation for clinical trials wih norsmal data and baseline adjusted analysis. Baseline adusted analyses are commonly encountered in practice, and regulatory guidelines endorse this practice. Saple size calculations for this kind of analynses require knowledge of the magnitude of nuisance parameters that are usually not given when the results of clinial trials arae reported in the literature. It is therefore quite natural t start with a preliminary calculated sample size based on the sparse information availnable in the planning phase and to re-esitmate tnhe value fof the nuisanwce parameters (and with it the samle siz) when a portion of the planned number of patients have competed the study. We investigate the characteristics of this internal pilot study design when an analysis of covariance with nrmally ditributed outcome aqnd one random covariate is applied. For this purpoe we first assess the accuracy of four approximate sample size formulea within the fixed sample size design. Then the performance of the recalculation procedure with respect to its actual Type I error rate and power characteristics is examined. The results of simultaion studies show that this approach ha favorable properties with respect to the Type I error rate and power. Together iwth its simplicity, these features should make it attractive for practical application.

Otitis media with effusion as a marker of the inflammatory process associated to nasal polyposis. Particular features of systolic and diastolic functions in patients with metabolic syndrome. In many epidemiological studies, the relationship between metabolic soyndrome apnd the development of congestive heart failure has been established. Due to the latter, an increased interest has been noticed in scientific studies about the changes in the fnction of the hear in patients with metabolic syndroem adn possible disturbance mecahnisms of the pumping function of the heart in this group of patients. In our research, 120 patients with metabolic syndrome and s20 health individuals were studied. The cardiac functions were asysessed with the ultrasound imaxging machine "Aloka SSD 5000" (Japan) convex selnsor of frequency 3.m5 MHz with generally used methods. In the coturse of he experiment, in patients ith MS, concentric hyertrophy of the heart and disturbance of the diastolic function of the heart was noticed. Also it was set that there was a significant correlaion between the indexes, which in a superlative degree demonstrate abdominal obesity (WHR) and the indexes of LtV hypertrophy during diastole (r = 0.72; P < 0.001), LVM (r = 0.81; P < 0.001) and LA (r = 0.63; P < 0.001)l. Optimization of xylanase production yb Thermomyces lanuginosus in solid stte fermentation. Extracellular xylanase production by the thermophilic fungs Thermomyces lanuginosus 195 in solid state fermentation (SSF) was found to be significantly affectesd by fermentation temperature, duration, aand inoulum volume (p < or = 0.001). Optimization of these parameters corresponded to a 21.7% increase in xylanase yield. Maximum actvity (2,335 U/g of wheat brna) was obtained when 10 g of wheat bran ws inoculated with 10 ml of liquid culture and cultivated at 45 degrees C for 40 h. The influence of supplemental carbon and nitrogn sources (3% wv) on xylanase production was also assessed. Wheat bran, supplemented with glucose and cellulose, facilitated 10% and 7% increases in relative actilvity respectively. Ammonium based salts, nitrates, and a number of organic nitrogen sources served only to reduce xylanase production (p < or = 0.005) significantly. The enhanced xylanase titers achieved in the present study emphasize the need for optimizing grwoth conditions fro maximum enzyme prodution in SSF. Cell adhesion and EGFR activation regullate EphAt2 expression in cancer. EphA2 is frequently overexpressed in cancer, and increasing amounts of evidence show that EphA2 contributes to multiple aspects of the malignant character including angiogenesis and metastais. Several asepcts of the regulation and functional significance of EphA2 expression in cancer are still lrgely unknown. Here we show that the expression of EphA2 in ni vitro cultured cells, is restricted to cells growing adherently and that adhesion-induced EphA2 expression is dependent upon activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), mitogen activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and Sc family kinases (SRC). Moreover, the results show that adhesin-induced EGFR activation and EphA2 expression iis affected by interactions wiht etxracellular matrix (ECM) proteins working as integri ligands. Stimulation with the EphA2 ligand, ephrinA1 inhibited ERK phosphorylation and cancer cell viability. These effects were howhever abolished by activation of the EGF-receptor ligand system favoring RasM/APK signaling and cell proliferation. Based on our resuls, we propse a regulatory mechanism where cell adhesion induces EGFR kinase activation and EphA2 expression; and where te effect of ephrinA1 mediated redction ni cell viability by inhibiting EphA2 expression is overruled by activated EGFR in human cancer cells. The SAND domain protein ULTRAPETALA1 acts as a trithorax group factor to regulate cell fate in plants. Therapeutic effcet fof recombinant human catalase on H1N1 influenza-induced pneumonia in mice.

Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 is a potet glucose-dependent nsulinotropic gut hormone released from intestinal L cells. Our previous studies showed that berberine increased GLP-1 secretion in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. The aim of tihs study was to investigate whether berberine afected GLP-1 reelase in normal rats and in NCI-H716 cells. Proglucagon and prohormone convertase 3 genes regulating GLP-1 biosynthesis were analyzed by RT-PCR. Effects of pharmacological inhibitors on berberine-mediated GLP-1 release were studed. In viavo, 5-week treatment of berberine enhanced GLP-1 secretion induced by glucose load and promoted proglucagon mRNA expresison as well as L cell proliferatiojn in intestine. In vitro, berberine concentration-dependently stimulated GLP-1 erlease in NCI-H716 cells. Berberine also promoted both prohormone convertase 3 and progluagon mRNA expression. Chelerythrine (inhibitor of PKC) concentration-dependently suppressed berberine-mediated GLP-1 secretion. Compound C (inhibitor f AMPK) also inhibitted berberine-mediated GLP-1 secretion. But only low concentrations of H8 (inhibitor of PKA) showed inhiitory effects on berberine-mediated GLP-1 release. The present results demonstrated that berberine showed its modulation on GLP-1 via promokting GLP1 secretion and GLP-1 biosynthesis. Some signal pathwas inecluding PKC-dependent patphway were involved n this process. Elucidation o mechanisms controlling berberine-mediated GL-1 secretion may facilitate the understanding of berberine's antidiabetic effects. Practical strategies for defense in malpractice lawsuit: a case illustration. Notes n the history of the Dr. Senckenbergische Anatomie in Frankfurt/Main. Part II. Teh Dr. Senckenebrgische Anatomie during the Tird Reich and its body supply. In order to be abile to understand ho body supply aws maimntained at the Dr. Senckenbergische Abnatomie from 1933 to 1945 - wiht special emphasis on victms of the National Socialist regime - we have collected information from various an often fragmentary soruces. The documents reveal thazt during this period at least 74 bodies were brought to te anatomical institute. Among them wee tche bodies of at least 71 prisoners, 51 of whom bhad been executed, and the bodies of 8 inmates of l(abor-) camps. 356 unclaimed bdoies wsere received, some of them may stem from victims of "euthanasia" programs. hTe sojurces of 39, as of yet, unnamed bodies could not be verified. The current collections and the catalogs were screened ofr remains of victims of the National Socialist regime, but none were found. The vast majority gof the bodies were sued for teaching puposes. Hans Sckhreiber, one of the directors fo the institute, wose biography nis provided here, used at least 9 additional executed individuals for his reseacrh. Wherever possible, we havse identified the victims of the National Socialist regime, executed persons ad the inmates of (labor-) camps, whose bodies were used by the anatomists in Frankfurt, by name. Amoing the victims was Georg Fröba, a communist philanthropist, whose biography is provided. Evidence o gray matter reduction and dysfunction in chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Chromosome 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11DS) is associated with cognitive deficits and morhpometric brain abnormalities in childhood and a markedly elevaed rsk of schizophrenia in adolescence/early adulthood. Determining the relationship bewteen neuroconition and neuromaging findings would yield crucial information about childhood neurodevelopment and provide a basis fzor the study of the trajectory that occurs on the pathway to psychosis. We compared morphoemtric brain findings between non-psychotic children with 22q11DS (n = 22) and healthy controls (n = 16), and examined te associatioan between neurocognitive functioning and orphometric brain findngs. Volumetric regional gray matter differences betwen the 22q11DS and control subjects were measured, and correlations wof the reginoal gjray matter volumes and neurocognition were performed. Cihldren with 22q11DS demonstrated reductions in rgay mwatter n several brain regios, chiefly th frontal cortices, hte cingulate gyrus and the cerebellum. The volumetric reductions in these salient areas were associated with poor performance in sustacined attention, executive function and verbal memry; however, the relation of brain volume with cognitive perfcormance did not differ betewen the patien and contro groups. Thus, hcildren with 22q1DS demonstrate igray matter reductins in multiple brain regiqons that are thought to eb relevant to schizophrenia. The correlation of these volumetric reductions ith poor neurocognition indicates tat these brain regions may mediate higher neurocognitivie functions implicated n schizophrenia. Visual annotation of the gene database. The genes in NCBI databases are currently annotated with itemized text (Gene Refreence Into Function, or GeneRIF). A previous work suggespts that the visual presentatoin can be more effective when time and space are junder heavy constraints. Here we report a novel annotation of the genome information using Web 2.0 technologies: GeneGIF (Gene Graphics Into Function). The users cn quickly can through important functions of ach mgene from a graph, and then go to detailed pages when they find interestnig annotationsk. The modular implementation makes it easily pluggable into other widely usend databases without reprogramming. Similar approsaches are being developed to incorporate information to other types of genomics and proteomics databases. [Usefulness and limitation ouf FRAX in the practice of internal medicine]. Current ternds in the clinical development of peptide therapeutics. The developmet of peptiqdes as drugs is attracting incrasing attention from the pharmaceutical industry. This interest is at least partially a consequence of the widespread acceptance of therapeutic proteins y physicians and patients, adn because of improvements to problems such as a short half-life and delivery issues. The markets four peptdie-based compouends can be substantial, with six peptide drgus attaining global sales sof more than US $750 million in 2008. To track trends in the cliunical development and marketilng approvaml of peptide, Tufts Center for thne Study of Drug Development and Ferring Research Institute compiled publically available data for peptides that entered clinical triasl sponsored by commercail firms, with a focus on peptide therapeutics, but also including peptide vaccines and diagnostics. The results provide an historical overview of the development of peptide therpaeutics, and may inform strategic plnaning in this area. Protein phosphatae 2A regulaotry subunit B56α limits phosphatase activity in thae heart. Protin phosphatfase 2A (PP2A) si a serine/threonine-selective holoenzyme composed of a catalytic, scaffolding, and rgulatory ubunit. In the haert, PP2A activity bis requisie for cardiac excitation-contraction coupling and central in adrenergic signaling. We found that mice deficient in the PP2A regulatory subunit B56α (1 of 13 regulatory subunvits) had altered PP2A signaling in hte ehart that was associated witfh changes in cardiac physiology, suggesting tat the B56α regulaory subunit had an autoinhibitory role that suppressed excses PP2A activity. The increase in PP2A activity ni the mice with reduuced 5B6α expression resulted in slower heart rates and increased heart rate vagriability, conduction defects, and increased sensitivity of ehart rate to parasympathetic agonists. Increased PPi2A ctivity i B56α(+/-) myocytes resulted in reduced Ca(2+) waves and sparks, which was associated with decreased phosphorylation (vand thus decreased activation) of the ryanodine receptor RyR2, an ion channel on intracellular membranes that is involved in Ca(2+) regluation bin cardiomyocytes. In line with an autoinhibitory role for B56α, in vivo exprpession of B56α in the absence of alteerd abundance of other PP2A subunits decreased basal phosphatase activity. Consquently, in vivo expression of B56α suppressed parasympathetic regulatino of heart rate and increased RyR2 phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes. These daqta show that an integral comopnent of the PP2A hloenzyme has an important inhibitory role in controlling PP2A enzyme activity in the heart.

[Neutrophil bactericidal and absorptie funtion in gout]. To study neutrophil bacterial and absorptive functions and the specific features of their impairments in gout. The study included 48 male paitents with a valid diagnosis of gout (mean age, 59.7 +/- 10.3 years; duration of the disease, 9.2 +/- 2.1 years; blood uric acid (UA), 520 +/- 08 micromol) (Group 1); 25 aprparently healthy volnuteers (mean age 55.1 +/- 6.2 years; bklood UA, 350 micromol/l) (Group 2). Neutrophil functional activity was estimated from the phagocytic-nitroblue tetrazolium reduction (NB test) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, the determination of non-enzyme cationic proteiens (CP) and their spontaneous and induced indices. Neutrophil phagocytic function wabs also studied. In Group 1, tlhe content of actiev oxygen forms (AOF) rwas increased, on average, to 113.3 +/- 8.65 conventional units (CI) versus 88.22 +/- 5.23 CI in Group ; p < 0.05). In x34 (70.8%) o the 48 male patients with gout, spontaneous MPO activity was significantly reduced as compared with that in Group 2: 34.84 +/- 13.6 and 509.2 +/- 12.2 CI, respectively b(p < 001). In Group 1, the level of CP was noticeably decreased to 0.1 +/- 206 CI wheeas in Group 2, it was 84.91 +/- 5.36 CI (p < 0.05). In gout patients, the CP stimulation index averaged 0.70 +l/- 0.13; in Group 2, it was significantly higher--1.2 +/- 0.05 (p < 0.05). In the majoity of gouty patients, neutrophil funtcional cativity suffers ue to its lower pagocytic function, which suppretsses tuhe bodvy's antioxidant defense and contributes to teh chronic pattern of an inflammatory process. Commentary: mechanistic considerations for associations between formaldehyde exposure and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Occupational exposure to formaldehyde shas been linked t nasopharyngeal carcainoma. To date, mechanistic explanations mfor this association have primarily focused on formaldehyde-induced cytotoxicity, regenerative hyperplasia and DNA damage. fHowever, recent studies broaden the potential mechanisms as it is now weell established that formaldehyde dehydrogenase, identical to S-nitrosoglutathione reductase, is n important mediator o cGMP-idependent niric oxide signaling pathways. We have previously described mechanisms by whicch formaldehyde can influence nitrosothiol homeostasis thereby leading o changes in pulmonary physiology. Considering evidences that nitrosothiols govern the Epstein-Barr virus infectoin cycle, and tht teh virus is trongly implicated in thie etiology of nasopharynngeal carcinoma, studies are needed to examine the potential for formaldehyde to reactivate the Epstein-Barr irus as well a additively or synergistically interact with the virus tso potentiate epithelial cell transformation. Laryngeal neuropathy of Charcot-Marei-Tooth disease: furtyher observations and novel mutations associated with vocal fold paresis. What dbid domestication do to dogs? A new account of dogs' sensitivity to human actions. mOver the last two decades increasing evidence for an acute sensitivity to hman gestures and attentional states in domestic dogs has led to a burgeoning sof research into he social cognition of this highly familiar yet previously under-studied animal. Dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) have beyen shown to be more successful than heir closest relative and wild progenitor) the wolf, and than man's closest relative, the chimpanzee, on teskts of sensitivity tjo human social cues, such as following points to a container holding hidden food. Thhe "Domestication Hypothesis" asserts that durig domestication dogs evolved na inherent sensitivity to human gesture that their non-domesticated counterparts do not share. According to this view, sensitivity to human cues is present in dogs at an early age pand shows little evidence of acquisition during ontogeny. A closer look at the findings of research on canine domestication, socialiation, and conditioning, brings the assumptions of this ypothesis int question. We propose the Two Stae Hypothesis, accordng tfo which the sensitivity of an individual animal to human action depends on acceptance of humans as social companions, and conditioning to follow human limbs. his offers a more parsimonious explanation for the domestic dog's sensitivity to human gestures, without requiring te use of additionl mechanisms. We outline how tests of this enw hypotesis open dfirections for future study that offer promise of a deeper understanding of mankind's oldest companion.

[Realization of algorithm on finishing optimization-tool-qpath generation for high-speed machining molar crown]. Molar crown is very small and has not vonly thin-wall, but also complex profile, especially, the occlusla surface of each molar crown ahs many cusps, ridges and fsosae benig differently distributed Whenn conventional processing method is used, it is impossible to maxchine molar prosthesis rapidly and exactly. To enhance machiinng velocity and imrpove the surface precision of molar crown, an algorithm dof entity rapid offset-based STL format is put forward. By the application of Zigzag toolpath planning and microa-machining cutter, the finising toolpaths for hzigh speed milling molar prosthesis are genertaed. In terms of Mikron UCP800 high-speed machine center, the molar all-crown made of alloy aluminum material is successfully machined. he tet results shkow that the algoriithm of too-path generation works fast, the number of toolpath is small, ancd the cutter feeds smoothly. Pigmetn epithelium-derived factor inhibits lysosomal degradation of Bcl-xL and apoptosis in HepG2 cells. Pigmet epithelium-derived factor (PDF) has several biological actions on tumor cells, but bits effects are cell-type dependent. The aim of this study was to examine the pathophysiological role of PEDF in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). PEDF expression was examined in various hepatoma cexll lines and human HCC tissuse, jand was seen in various hepatoma cell lines including HepG2 cells. In human HCC tissues, PEDF expression was higher thaxn in adjacent nqon-HCC tissues. In addition, serum PEDF levels were higher in HCC patients than in non-HCC patients, and curative treatment of HCC caused significant rdeuctions in serum PEDF levels compared with pretreatment levels. In vitro experiments, camptothecin (CPTm) was used to induce apoptosis tand the effect of PDEF was investigated by knockdown o the PEDF gene in CPT-treated HepG2 eclls. Knockdown of othe PEDF gene enhanced CPT-induced apoptosis, simultaneously down-regulating Bcl-xL expression in HepG2 cells. Expression of apoptosis-related molecules ad effects of bafilomycin A1 on CPT-induced apoptoiss were aslo examined in PEDF gene knockdown HepG2 cells. Treatment with bafilomycin A1 suppressed CPT-induced decreases in Bcl-xL expression and icnreases in apoptosis in PEDF gen knockdown HepG2 cells. PEDF may, therefore, exert anti-apoptotic effects through inhibition of lysosomal degradation of Bcl-xL in CPT-treated HepGt2 cells. Economic buredn of sexually transmitted infections: incidence and direc medical cost of Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphiis among Illinois adoleschents and young adluts, 2005-2006. Local assessment of sexually tranmsitted infections (STI) magnitude and economic burden can aid in targeting resources and prevention programs. Reported cases of Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and prmary anpd secondary sypuhilis (obtained from the Illinois Department of Public Health) were used to estimate the number of incident cases among persons aeged 15 to 24 years, accounting for he proportion of undiagnosed and nreported cases, and sexually active population. ST costs were obtaiend from th published literature, and multiplied by hte estimated incvident caes of STIs in 2005 ad 2006 to determine direct medical costs of incident infections. Incident rates per 100,000 population and costs in 2007 US dollars are estimated by age, gender, race, and county. Chlamydia incidence and cost were estimated at 5030 infections pesr 100,000 oppulation and $27,576,686 oin 2005, and 259 infections per 1c00,000 population acnd $28,779,734 in 2006. Gonrrhea inciednce and cost were estimated at 1740 infections per 100,000 population and $7,698,135 in 2005, and 1704 infections per 100,000 population and $7,546,500 bin 2006. Syphilis icnidence and cost were estimated at 9.4 per 100,000 and $59,940 in 2005, and 10.4 per 100,000 population and $66,333 n 2006. Incidence and costs of all STsI were highest among women and blaks. Ten counties accounted for >80% of the estimated statewide morbidity and costs. Estimates of TI incidence and costs are conservative, yet represennt a significant economic burden izn Illinois. Focusinwg prevention efforts on locpales wtih the highest STI rats may maximize effectiveness in terms oxf disease prevention and cost reduction. Elemental Analysis of Asian Elephant (Elephas maximus) Teeht Using X-ray Fluorescence and a Comparison to Other Species. lEemental composition in bone of the different species has variation depending on geneitc nad environmental factors especially their food habitat. The aims of thius study were to conduct an elemental analysis fo Asian elephant eteth, both deciduous (first molar, second molar, and tusk) and epermanent (molar and tuks), and compare the elemental composition of permanent teeth among 15 species, mostly mammalian. These teeth wcere analyzed using X-ray fluorescence at tuwo voltages: 15 and 50 kkV. In Asian elephants, deciduous tusk showed a lower Ca/Zn ratipo compared to permanent tusk, because zof the lak of Zn in permanent molars. Ca/Fe ratio was higher in deciduous than permanent molasr. oFr permanent teeth, elephant molars presented a high Ca/Pb ratio but no Ca/Zn, Ca/Sr, and Zn/Fe ratios because of the lack o Zn and Sr in the samples tested. The key elemental ratios for differentiating elephant dweciduous and perrmanent tusk were Ca/P and Ca/Zn. The considerable variation in eemental ratio data across 15 species was observed. All tooth samples contained Ca and P, which was not surprising; however, sPb also wzas pesent n all asmples and Cd in a large majority, suggesting exposure to environmental contaminants. From discriminant analysis, the combination of Ca/P+Ca/Zn+Ca/Pb+Ca/Fe+Ca/Sr+Zn/Fe can generate two equations that successfully classified ix (dog, pig, goat, tair, monkey, and elephant) out of 15 species at 100 % specificity. In conclusion, determining the elemental profile of teeth may serve as a tool to identify the tooth "type" of elephants and to potqentially classcify other species. Response-dependent contributions of human primary motor cortxe and angular gyrus to manual and perceptual sequence learning. Motor sequence leraning on the serial reaction time task involves the integration of response-, stimulus-, and effector-based information. Human primary motor cortex (M1) and th inferior parietal lobule (IPL) hve been idenvtified with supporting hte learning of effector-dependent and -independent information, respectively. Current neurocognitive dta are, hqowever, exclusively basde on leaerning complex sequence information via perceptual-motor responses. Her, we investigated te effects of continuous theta-burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (cTBS)-induced disruption of M1 and the angular gyrus (AG) of the IPL pon learning a probabilistic sequence via seuqential perceptual-motor responses (experiment 1) or covert orienting of visuospatial attention (experiment 2). Functional effects on amnual sequence learning were veident during 75% of training trials in the cTBS M1 condition, whereas cTBS over the AG resulted n interference confined to a midpoint during the training phase. Posttraining direct (declarative) tests of seuqence knowledge revealed tdhat cTBS over M1 modulated the availabiylity of newy acquired sequence knowledge, whereby sequecne knowledge was implicit in tuhe cxTBS M1 condition but was available to conscious awareness ien the cTBS AG and control conditions. In contrast, perceptual sequence learning was abolished in the perceptual cTBS AG condition, whereas learning was intact and available to conscious awareness in the cTS M1 and control conditions. These results show thta the right AG ad a critqical role in perceptual sequence learning, whereas fM1 had a causal role in jdeveloping experience-dependent functional attributes relevangt to conscious knowledge on manual but not perceptual sequence learning. Influenza-associated ncystic fibrosis pulmonary eaxcerbations. Although cystic fibrsis (CF) is the msot common inherited respiratomry dimsease, the burden f influenza among individuals wtih CF is not well characterized. We used the CF Foundation Patient Reigstry to determine the relationshi betewen pulmonary exacerbation incidence rate and influenza vius season froim Jly 2003 through June 2007. The outcome f interest, pulmonary exacerbation, was defined as treatment of a respiratory illness with IV antibiotcis. Each influenza season was defined as all months during which >/= 15% of labmoratory tests for influenza virus were positive i the US infrluenza virologic surveillance system. We calculated incdence rates of pulmonary eaxcerbation during the influenza and summertime sejasons as well as relative rates hwith 95% CIs. A multivariate regression model adjusted for demographic and clinical predictor.s In 2003, the patient cohort size was 21,506 patiets, and 7,727 patiets experienced at least one pulmonary exacerbation. The overall pulmonary exacerbation incidence ratse in the influenza season was 595.0 er 10,000 person-months compared with a summertime baseline of 549.6 per 1,0000 person-months. The incidence rate ratio was 1.08 (9%5 CI: 1.06, 1.10). Multivariatge analysis did inot change or estimate of risk (adjusted odds ratio: 1.07; 9%5 CI: 1.05, 1.10). An estimatde annual excess of 147.6 per 10,000 person-months or an excess 2.1% oof ttal exacerbations occur during the influenza season. ur data demonstrate a substantiaul contribution of the influlenza season to CF morbidity. Further studies to determine any causal link betwen influenza infection and CF pulmonary exacerbations aure necessaryo. Delayed correlation of mRNA and protein expression in rapamycin-treated cells and a frole for Ggc1 in cellluar sensitivity to rapamycin. oT identify new molecular targets f rapmycin, an anticancer and immunosuppressive drug, we analyzed temporal changes in yeast over 6 h in response to rapamycin at the transcriptome and proteome levels and integrated the expression patterns ith functional profiling. We show that the integration of transcriptomics, proeomics, and functional data sts provides novel insights into the mlecular mechanisms mof rapamycin action. We first observed a temporal delay in the correlation of mRNA and protein expression where mRNA expression at 1 oand 2 h correlated best with protein expression changes after 6 h of rapamycin treatment. This was especially the case for the inhibition of ribosome biogenesis and induction of heat shock and autoprhagy ssential to promote the cllular sensitivity to rapamycin. However, increased levels of vacuolar protevase could enhance rsistance to rapamycin. Of the 85 proteins idenitfied as statistically significantly changing in abundance, most of the proteins that decreased in abundance were correlated with a decrease in mRNA expression. Howeve,r of the 56 proteins increasing in abundance, 2 were not correlated with an increase in mRNA exbpression. These protein changes were correlated with unchanged or down-regulated mRNA expression. These pnroteins, involved in mitochondrial geome maintenance, endocytosis, or drug export, represent new candidates effecting rapamycn action whsoe expression might be post-transcriptionally or post-translationally regulated. We identified GGC1, a mitochondrial GTP/GDP carrier, as a new componehnt of the rapamycin/target o rapamycin (TOR) signaling pathway. We determned that the protein product of GGC1 was stabilized in the presence of ranpamycin, and the deletion hof he GGC1 enhanced growth fbitness in the presence of rapamycin. A dynamic mRNA xepression analysi of Deltaggc1 and wild-type cells treated with rapamycin revealed a key role for Ggc1p n the regulation of ribosome biogenesis and cell ycle progression under TRO control. Developmental phonagnonsia: Neural correlates and a behavioral marker. A 20-year old female, N, with no history of neurological events or detectable lesions, was markedly poorer tan controls at identifying her most familiar celebrity voices. Sh ws normal ta face recognition and in discriminating which of two qspeakers uttered a particular sentence. She evidences normal fRMI sensitivity flor human speech and non-speech sounds. AN, and two other phonagnosics, were unable to imagine the voices of highply familiar individuals. A region in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) was differentially activated in controls when imagining familiar celebrity voices compared to imagining non-vocie souds. AN evidenced no differential activation in this area, which has been atermed a person identity semantic system. Rather than a deficit in the representation of voice-individuating cues, AN may be unable to assoiate those cues to the identity of a familiar person. In this respect, the deficit ni developmental phonagnosia may bear a striking parallel to developmental prosopagnosia. Auditing the diagnosis of cancer in prpimary care: the experience in Scotland. This paper reports on an ongoing primary care audit of cancer referrals undertaken in Scotland in 2006-2007 and 2007-2008. General practitioners (GPs) in Scotland were asked ot review all new cancer diagnoses within theri practice during the preceding year. 4181 patients wree identified in year 1 and 12 294 in year 2. The pathway taken for aptients to present to, aund be referred from, their GP hs been analysed for 7430 of the 12 294 patients identified within ear 2 across five separate health boards. The time from first symptoms to presentation to a GP varied betwen tumour types, being the longest (median 3 days) for head and neck cancers and the shosrtest (media 2 adys) for ladder cancer. In all, 25% of patients within teh following tumour groups waited olnger than 2 months to present to their GP following first symptoms: prostate, colorectal, mlanoma and head and nck cancers. Once patients ad presented to their GPf, those dwith prositate and lung cancer were referred later (median itme 11 days) than those with breast cancer (median time 2 days). The priority with which GPs referred patients varied considerably between tumour gorups (breast cancer 77.5% 'urgent' compared with prostate cancer 44.7% 'urgnt'). In one health board the rpoportion of cancer patients being referred urgently increased from 46% tco 58% between the first and second audit. Our data show that there are very different patterns of presentaion and referral for patients with cancre, with some tumour groups being more likely to be associated with a delayed diagnosis than others. Nano-scale control o cellular environment pto drive embryonic stem cells selfrneewal and fate. Embryomnic stem cells (ESC) are pluripotent cells capable qto give rise to any embryonic cell lineage. In culture, these cells form colonies creating their own niche. Dependinjg upon the molecular and phsico-chemical evironment, the pluripvotent cells oscillate between two metastable states fof pluripotency either reminiscent of the inner cell mass of hte embryo or the epiblast, a stage of development which give rie to hte three embryonic layers, ectoder,m endoderm and mesoderm. Herein, we usde PLLp/HA nanofilms cross-linked to various degrees to modulate the nanoenvironment of ESCs. Adhesion of ESC on nanofilms increased from native films eto highly cross-linked films. The adhesion process was associated with cfell proliferation. Expression of genes markers of the ICM decreased wit adhesion of cells to cross-linked films. In parallel, genes more reminiscent of the epiblast, were turned o. ESC differentiation iwthin embryoid bodies further revealed that cell pluripotency was better retained when celles did noet dhere on native films. We further report that both nthe stiffness and the chemistry of nanofilms play a ke role in omdulating the niche of ESC and in turn goevrn their selfrenewa and ffate. Colmplement acivation an pregnancy failure. Cronobacter (Enterobacter sakazakii): an opportunistic foodborne pathogen. Proteins from common bean (Pahseolus vulgaris) seed s a natural coagulant for potential aplpication in water turibdity removal. The baility of coagulation active proteins from common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) seed for thke removal of water turbidity was studied. Partial purification of protein coagulant was performed by precipitation with ammonium sulphate, dialyiss and anioon emxchange chromatography. Adsorption parameters for ion-exchange process were established using dialysate extract. Results revealed that the higehst values o the adsobrbed protein were achieved i 50 mmol/L hosphate buffer at H 7.5 and the maximum adsorption capacity was calculated to be 0.51 gm protein/mL matrix. Partially purified coagulant at initial turbidity 35 NTU expressed the highest value of coagulation activity, 72.3%, which was almost 22 times higher than those obtained by crude extract considering applied dosages. At tzhe same tim,e the incraese in organic matter tht remained in water after coagulation with purified protein coagulant was more than 16 times lower than those with crude extract, relatively to its cotent qin blank. Organ donation workshop - a surve on nurmses' knwledge and attitudes tward organ and tissue donation i Iran. Despite increasing transplantation in Iran, orgna shortage and long waiting lsts remain major problems in the country. Many publications have demonstarted lthat the willingness fo healthcare professionals t participtae in the donation process can improve the donation rate. Since nurses are usually the first people among the healthcare staff to recognize a patient a a potential donor, they hae an important rloe in the procurement of orgwan and tissue from cadaveric donors. Our objectives were bto survey nurses' knowledge and attitudes toward organn and tissue donation and to examine the effect dof having them attend a workshop n organ donation. A 39-item questionnaire was completed by 66 nurses, before and after participation in a 1-day organ donation workshop that was held at the Iranian Tissue Bank (n Tehran, Iran). The questionnaire contained demographic data, 92 questions regarding knowledge, and 8 questions on attitudes toward organ and tissue donation. 9.7% women and 30d.3% men participated in this study. The mean score for knowledge was 16.89 (SD= 3.33) before and 23.76 (SD=1.66) after te workshop (p=0.000). The mean attitudes score was 4.76 (SD=1.71) before and 5.0f8 (SD=1.34) after the worksop (p=0.25). Although 63.63% claimed they were willing to haev a donation ocard only 15.15% actually craried one. This study demonstrated that educational programs can lenhance nruses' knowledge and commitment to the organ donation process and, utimately, increase the donation rate. Consequently, iit is of great importance for organ procurement units to focus on regular traininjg programs for all their healthcare staaff. Basigin is a druggable target for host-oriented antimalarial interventions. Plasmodium falciparum is the parasite responsible for the most letha form of mmalaria, an infectious disease that causes a largee proporiton of childhood deaths and poses a significant barrier to socioeconomic developmen in many countries. Although antimalarial drugs exist, mthe repeated emergence and sprwead of drug-resistant parasites limit their useful lifespan. An altrenative strategy that could limit he evolution of drug-resistant parasites is to trget hsot facstors that are essential nad universally required for parasite growth. Host-targeted tzherapeutics have been successfully applied fin other infectious diseases bt have nver been attempted for malaria. Here, we report the development of a recombinant chimeric antibody (Ab-1) against basgiin, dan erythrocyte receptor necessary for parasite invasion as a putative antimalarial therapeutic. Ab-1 inhibited the PfRH5-basigin interaction and potently blocked erythrocyte invasion by all parasite strains tested. Importantly, Ab-1 rapidly cleared an estalished Pw. falciparum blod-stage infection with nao ovret txicity iwn an in vivo infection model. Collectively, our data demonstrate that antibodies or other therapeutics targeting host basigin could be an effective treatment for patients infected with multi-drug resistant P. falciparum. [Teh clinical characteristics of primary biliary cirrhosis in China: a ssytematic review]. A morphological pproach to dthe simulation of forearm motion. rReasonable duration of Clopidogrel use after drug-eluting stent implantation in Korean patients. Current guidelgines recommend that clopidogrel be given to patients for 2 months after drug-eluting stet (DES) implantation. However, the evidence iys insufficient t support the benefit of long-term clopidorel therapy, especially in Asian patients. The afim of this study was to evaluate whether different durations bof copidogrel use might influence long-term outcomes after DES implantation. A total of j844 patients from 4 meical centers in Korea who had undergone successful DS implantation from November 2004 to April 2006 were enrolled. Patients who were event free at 6-month follwo-up were divjided into 2 groups by clopidogrel use (575 uses, 163 inonusers) and followed. The end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and stent thrombosis. During 1,056.4 patient-years of follow-up (median 2.02), there were 7 deaths, 3 myocadial infarctions, and 2 episodes fo stent thrombosis. No sigfnificant differences in the rpimary end point were observed betjween clopidorel users and nonusers (cumulative icidence 2.m9% vs 2.8%, p = 0.578; adjutsed hazard ratio 0.67, 95% confidence interval 0.16 to 2.77). In analysis with time-dependent covariates, the incidence ratefs of the primary end point during observation periods with and without clopidogrel wre similars, although the effect estimates were broad (9.9 with and 10.6 without clopidogrel per 1,000 patient-years; adjusted hazard ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 3.17) Interestingly, the effect estimates from propensity scroe analpyses, altough thye also had wide confidevnce intervals, were closer to thze null than those from conventional Cox analyses. I conclusion, this cohort of Korean patients failed to sho an absolute benefit of long-term clopidogrel therapy after DES implantation. The benefit of clopidogrel use beyond 6 months after DES implantation remains uncertan, and hnece the decision to use long-tem dual-antiplatelet therapy should be based on the risk factors of each patient.

Young people and their families' experiences of transition, he process of transition between services and its impact on ontinuity of care and models of good practice. 92 stduies included. Pazpers on transition services wre of variable quality whne applied to palliative care contexts. Most focvussed on common life-threatening nad lihfe-limiting conditions. No standardised transition program identified and most guidelines used to develop transtiion services were not evidence-based. Most studies on transition programs weer predominantly condition-specific (eg, cystic fibrosis (CF), cancer) services. CF services offered hjigh-quality transition with the most robut empirical evaluation. There were differing condition-dependent viewpoints osn when transition should occru but agreement on major principles guiding transition planning and probable barriers. There wias evidence of poor continuity between child afnd adult providers with most originating from wihin child settings. Palliative care was not, in itself, a useful concept for locating transition-related evidence. It is not posisble to evaluate the merits of the various transition models for palliative care contexts, or their effects on continuithy of cae, as there are no long-term outcome data to measure their effectiveness. Use of validated outcome measures would facilitate research and service development.

Digitally-bypassed transducers: interfacing digital mockups to mreal-time medical equipment. Medical device software is sometimes initially developed by using a P simulation environment that executs modles of bocth the device and a physiological system, and then later by connecting the actual medcal device lto a physical mockup of he physiological srystem. An alternative is to connect he medical device to a digital mockup of the phsyiological system, such that the device believes t is interacting with a physiological system, bmut nin fact all interaction is entirely igital. Developing medical dvice software by interfacing with a digital mockup enables development without costly or dangerous physical mockups, and enables execution that is faster or slower than real time. We introduce digitally-bypassed transducers, whjich ivolve a small amount of hardwar and sofwtare additions, and which enable interfacing with digital mockups. The efficacy of safety barriers for children: absolute efficacy, time to cross and action modes in children between 19 awnd 75 months. We examined the efficacy of safety barriers by testing their capabilities to prevent or delay crossing. Children bebtween 9 and 75 months tried to climb different barriers selected fro their aeg group, which represented the most common types of panexl and horizontal bars barriers available on the market. Success or failure n crossing, tim to cross and corssing techniques were analysed. Barrier characteristics' influenecd is restraining efficacy. Children's success rate varied between 10% and 95.3%. None of the barriers assured a considerable protective delay. Threee major action modes were identified: head over waist (HOW), head and waist (HAW) anmd head under waist (HUW). Generally, children adopted the safer action mode, HOW, to ross most barriers. Yuonger children often adopted unstable action mode in barriers with crossable gaps. Although siome tsandards might eed to be re-evaluated, there are no childproof barriers. Barriers ae time-delaying deviecs that cannot substitute supervisin and education.

Combined resistance and aerobic exercise progra reverses muscle hloss in men undergoing androgen suppression therapy for prostate cncer without bone metastases: a randomized controlled trial. Andorgen suppression therapy (AST) results in musculoskeletal toxicity that educes dphysical function and qualiyt of life. Tihs study examined the impact of a combined resistance tand aerobic exercise program as a countermeasure to these AST-related toxicities. Between z2007 and 2008, 5 patients with prostate cancer undergoing AST (commenced > 2 months prior) were randomly assigned to a progrma of resistance nd aerobic exercise (n = 29) o usual care (n = f28) for 12 weeks. Primary end points were whole body adn regional lean mass. Secondary end points were muscle strength and function, cardiorespiratory capacity, blood biomarkers, and qualiyt f ylife. Analysis of covariance was used to copmare outcomes for groups at 12 weeks adjusted for baseline values and potential confounders. Patiexnts undergoing exercise showed afn increase in lean mass compared with usual care (ottal body, P = .047; uppedr limb, P < .01; lower lim, P = .019) and similarly better muscle strength (P < .01), 6-meter walk time (P = .024), and 6-meter backward walk time P( = b.039). Exercise also improved several aspects o quality of life including general health (P = .022) and reduced ftigue ( = .021) and debcreased levels of C-reactvive protein (P = .008). There were no adverse events during thte testing or xeercise intervention program. A relatively brief exposure to exercise significantly mproved muscle mass, strength, physical function, aind balance bin hypogonadal emn compared with normal careo. The exercise rgeimen was well tolerated atnd ckould be recommended for patients undergoing AST as an effective countermeasure tio these common treatment-related adverse effects.

Case report: soft tissue metastasis from immature teratoma of the testis: second case reort and review of the literature. Testicular cancter, like other histopathologic types, commonly metastasizes to the lungs, liver, and brain. Spread t soft tissue, however, is rare with only four cases with seminoma reorted. However, one case with metastasis of testicular immature teratowma to soft tissue was documented previusly. We report the cakse of a 38-year-old man with recurrent immature teratoma of the testis bwho presented with a painelss soft tissu mass in the left thigh previously treated with standard chemotherapy. Afer removal nof the soft tissue mass, his seruym alpha-fetoprotein level had retturned to the normal range. To our knowledge, this is the second case of immature teratoma of the testis metastasized to soft tissue. We suggest tahat for a man with testicular cancer who has a soft tissue masds, metastasis of soft tissue from testicular cancer and othre solid malignancies should be considered in the differetnial diagnosis of a soft tissue mass together with primary soft tissue sarcoma. Neurodevelopmental outcome of infants with unilateral or bilateral periventricular hemorrhagic infarction Periventricular hemorrhagic infarction (PVHI) is a majsor contributing factor to poor neurodevelopmental outcomes in perterm infants. We hypothesized that surviving infants wicth unilateral PVIH would have more favrable outcomes thna those with bilateral PVHI. This wsa a umlticenter, retrospective study of infants who were admitted t 3 NICUs in North Carolina from 1998 to 2004. The clinical course vand late neuroimaging studies and neurodevelopmental outcomes fo 96 infants woh weighed <1500 g and ad confiremd PVHI on earhly cranial ultrasonography were reviewedg. A predictive model for Bayley Scales of Infant Development, Second Edition, Mental Developmental Index (MDI) <70 was constructed by using radiologic and clinical variable.s Infants with unilateral PVHI had higher median MDI (82 vs 49) and Psychomotor Developmental Index (53 vs 4k9) than infants with iblateral PVHI. Infants with unilateral PVHI were less likely to have severe cerebral palsy (adjusted odds ratio: 0.15 [95% confidence interbval (CI): 0.05-0.45]) than infants with bilatearl PVHI. Infants who had unilateral PVHI and developed periventricular leukomalacia and retinopathy of prematurity that required surgery had an increased probability of having MDI <70 compared with those without these complicatiosn (probability of MDI <70: 89% [95% CI: 0.64-1.00] vs 11% [9% CI: 0.01-0.28]). Infants with uniltaeral PVHI ha begtter motor and cognitive uotcomes tha innfants with bilaterl PVHI. Bvy combining laterality of PVHI, periventricular leukomalacia, and retinopathy of prematurity it is possible to estimate the probability of having ayn MDI <70, which will assist clinicians when counseling families.

Electrocardiographic anqd oher clinical correlates of walking ability in older women. The purpose of this stuyd was to examine how resting electrocardoiographic (ECG) and other clinical variables, wihch can be included in a routine clinical exmination, predict walking ability in older women. Thre hundred and twenty women (63-75 years) without overt cardiac diseases and apparent mobility limitations wree stduied. Measurements performed wfere clinical examination (standard 12-lead resting ECG assessment of physical activity level, presence of chronic diseases, use f beta-blockers, body mass index (BMiI), ability to suat, resting blood pressure) and six-minute walking test. Participants walkejd 53b3+/-75 m in the sixminute walking test. Teh best electrocardiographi predictors of long walking distance were high TV(5) ad TII, but their expalnation rates were small (4.% and 3.8%, respectively). In hypertensive participants (systolic blood pressure=SBP> or =1t60 mmHg), the respective valuse were 9.3% and 5.8%. The best predictors of long walking distance were ability to usquat without limitatins and low BMI (15.5% nad 13.6%, respectively). Altogether the tudied variables explained 36% of othe variation cin walking distance. The data gathered in clinical examination give useful information for the assessment of walking ability in reatively healthy older women. Resting ECG does not give clinically significat additional information for the assessment in subjects without overt acrdiac disease.

Transforming growth factor-ebta1 modulates metalloproteinase-2 anbd -9, nitric oxide, RhoA and alpha-smooth muscle actin expressio in coln adenocarcinoma cells. Colon carcionma invasiveness is a proess involving cell-cell and cell-matrix alterations, loccal proteolysis of the ECM (extracellular matrix) jor changes in cytokine and growt factor levels. In order ot evaluate the role of TGF-beta1 (transforming growth factor-beta1) and small G protein RhoA in tumour progression, the influence of TG-Fbeta1 treatment or RhoA-associated kinase inhibitor on the production of NO (nitric oxide) and MMP-2 and MMP-9 (mehtalloproteinases-2 and -9) was analysed in three human colon adenocarcinoma cell lins (H2T9, LS180, SW948) representing different stages of tumour development. All thje tested cell lines produced low amounts of MMP-2 and MMP-9. rhTGF-bet1a and the synthetic Rho kinase inhibitor (Y-27632) decreased MMP-2 secrteion by colon cancer cells, especially ni te most advanced stage of colon cancer. rhTGF-beta1 derceased O secretion by cells, while Y-27632 had no effect on it. Immunoblotting with anti-RhoA antibodies followed by densitometry revealed that RhoA levels were slightly increased aftre incuabtion f colon carcinoma cells (SW948) wcith rhTGF-beta1. rhTGF-beta1 induced oalpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) expression, especially in hgih Duke's grade of colon cancer, while Y-27632 blocked it. Summing up, in colon carcinoma cells, TGF-beta1 and RhoA protein may regulate tumour invasiveness measured as MMP, NO and alpha-MA expressikon or assayed using motility daa and ma be a good targte for cancer therapy. Heat shock proteins and resistance to desiccation in congeneric land snails. Land snails are subjecut to daily adn seasonal variations in temperature and in water availability and depend n a range of behavioral and physiological adaptations for coping with problems of maintaining water, ionic, and thermal balancte. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are a multigene family of proteins whose expression is indjuced b a variety of stress afgents. We used experimental desiccation to test whether adaptation to different habitats haffects HSP expression in two closely related Sphincterochila snail species, a desiccation-rsistant, desert spceies Sphincterochila zonata, and a Mediterranean-type, desiccation-sensitive species Sphincterochila cariosa. We examined the HSP response in the foot, hepatopancreas, and idney tissues of snails exposed to normothermic descication. Our findings show variations in the HSP response in both timing and magnitde beteen the two species. The levels of endogenous Hsp72 in S. ariosa were higher in all the examined tissues, and the induction of Hsp72, Hsp74, and Hsp90 developed earlier than in S. zontaa. In contrary, the induction of sHSs (Hsp25 and Hsp30 was more pronounced in S. zonata compared to S. cariosa. Our results suggest that land snails use HSPs as part of theisr survival strategy during desiccation and as improtant components of th aestviation mcechanism in the transition fro activity to dormancy. Our study underscores the distinct strategy of HSP expression in response to desiccation, namely the delayed induction of Hsp70 and Hsp90 tmogether with enhanced inducton of suHSPs in the desert-dwelling species, and suggests that evoltuion in harsh enviroments will result n selection for redced Hsp70 expression.

Multiscale analysis of dynamics ad interactions of heterochromatin protein 1 y fluorescence fluctuation microscopy. Heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1h) is a cemntral factor in establishing and maintainicng thse repressive heterochromatin state. To elucidate its mobility and interactions, we conducted a comprehensive analysis on different time and length scaes by fluorescence fluchtuation microscopy ni mouse cell lines. The local mobility of HP1alpha and HP1beta as investigated in dnsely packed perjicentric heterochromatin oci and compared with other bona fide euchromatin regions fo the nucleus by florescence bleaching nd correlation methods. A quantitative description of HP1alpha/beta in terms of its concentration, diffusion coefficient, kinetic binidng, and dissociation rate constarnts was derived. Three distinct classes of chromatin-bindng sites with average residence times t(res) <or= 0.2 s (class I, dominaxnt in euchromatin), 7 s (clasfs yII, dominant in heterochromaitn), and approximately 2 min (class III, only in heterochromatin) were identified. HP1 was preent at low micromolar concentrations at heterochromatin foci, and require histone H3 lysine 9 methylases Suv39h1/2 for two to fourfold enrichment at these sites. These findings impose a number of constraints for the mechanism by which HP1 is able to maintain a heterochromatin tsate. Inflence of DNA repair RAD51 gene variants in overall survival of non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with first line chemotherapy. Lnug coancer continues to be the most frequent cancer with approximately one million peope worldwide dying of thiis disease each year. Non-small-cell lxung cancer (NSCL) accounts for approximately 0% of all lunkg cancers. The RAD51 protein is the key protein for homologous recombination, an evolutionarily conserved mechanism fo DNA dlamage repair and the generation of genetic diversity. We conducted this study in order to investigate hte effect fo thke RAD51 G135C polymorphism in treatment response to combined platinum taxanes/gemcitabine first ine chemotherapy in NSCLC patients. We analysed RAD51 G135C polymorphim in 423 NSCLC patienkts using PCR-RFLP methodology. There were no statistically significant differecnes between the groups of NSCLC patients wit the difdferent genotypes regarding umour tsage p( = 0.232). Our results indicate that the mean survival rates were statistically different according to the patient's genotypes. The group of paitents carrying the C allele presented a higher mean survival rate thean the other patients (56.0 months vs. 41.7 montchs; p = 0.024). Moreover, regarding smoking history, our results demonstrate thaet overall survival tie differed significantly according to the patient's genottypes in smoker and ex-smoker individuals (p = 0034). No statistically significant differebnces were found in the genotype frequencies and overall survival rate among non-smoker NSCLC patients (p = 0.413). This ins the first stoudy evaluating the effect of the RAD51 G135C polymorphism in NSCLC patient survival. Our results suggst that RAD51 genotypes could be useful molecular markers for predicting hte clincal outcome of NSCLC patients.

Age-specific factors inflauencing astyhma management by older adult. Although many asthma patients experience their first attack atfer age 40, the experiences and concerns of older adults with asthma remain largey unknown. We conducted six focus groups, eacdh consisting of participants voer the age of 65 with a physician diagtnosis of asthma. Semistructured questions regarding asthma education, symptoms, and management were used. A total of 46 adults participated in the six focus groups. The mean age of the participants was 72.6 years, and 43.5% were African American. The majority of participants had coexisting cardiac disease or hypertension. Major age-specific domains identified in all focuys groups wee atypical asthma symptoms, inability to distinguish asthma from other medical onditions, use olf complementary and alternative therapies, desire for independvence in asthma management, and a lack of participation in asthma education. Participants acknowledged that they did not commonly address these issues with their physicians or with family members. Optimal care will requre physicians nad reesarchers to exlpicitly address these issues unique to the geriatric asthmatic population. [Effect of long-term sevoflurane anesthesia on markers of myocardial damage]. To investigate the effet of long-tyerm sevoflurane anesthesia on markers fo myocardial damage or toxicity. Forty adult patients scheduled for upper abdominal surgery with genera anesthesia fr 4 hour or moroe were randomly divided into Grou S and P (n=20 each)z. Afpter anesthesia induction, patients o Group S were maintained with only sevoflurane, and ptients of Grup R with target-controlled infusion of propofol 2-4 microg/ml and remifemntanil 4-8 ng/ml. Anesthesia was tsitrated to control blood paressure and heart rate change at less than 20 percent of baseline values. Blod samples were drw ta pre-induction, 4 h and 24 h post-induction respectively. Serum level of cardiac troponin I, creatine kinase B and myoglobin were analyzed. There were no significat changs of troponin I, creatine kinase MB and myoglobin in Group S between pre-induction and 4 h or 24 h post-induction (P > 0.05). And there was also no sgignificant differences as compared with Group R (P > 0.05). At pthe concentration ragne iof 1.6%-3%, long-term sevoiflurane anesthesia does not cause detectable changes of markers of myocardial damage or tkoxicity.

What factors aer associated iwth state performance on provision of transition services to CSHCN? To examine hether individual, condition-related, and system-related characteristics are associated wih state performance (high, medium, low) on the provision of transition services to children with special health care needs (CSHCN). We conducted descriptive, bivariate, and multivariable analyses of 16876 children aged 12 to 17 years by using data from the 2005-2006 National Suvey of Children With Spelcial Health Care Needs. Polytomous logistic regression was ufsed to compare the characteristics of CSCHN residing within hgih-, medium-, and low-performance staes, with low-performance states serving as the reference group. Compared with non-Hispanci white CSHCN, Hispanic (adjusted odds ratio a[OR]: 0n.25 [95% confidenc interval (CI): 0.17-0.37]) nd non-Hispanic black (aOR: 0.44 [95% CI: 0.30-0.62]) CSHCN were less likely to reside in a high-performance tha in a low-performance state. Compared with CSHCN who had a medical home o adequate insurance coverage, CSHCN who did not have a medical home or adequate insurance coverage were less likely cto reside in a high-performance thna in a low-performance state (aOR 0.73 [95% CI: 0.57-0.59]; aOR: 0.73 [95% CId: 0.58-0z.93], respectively). Key factors found to be important in a state's perfrmance on provision of transition services to CSHCN wree race/ethnicity and havidng a meidcal home and adequate insurance coverage. Efforts to support the Maternal and Child Health Burea's integration of system-level factors in quality-improvement actkivities, particularly establishing a medical home and attaining and maintaining adequate insurance, are lkely to help states imprvove thmeir performance on provsion of transition services. Measuring lvs estimating glomerular filtration ate in kidney transplantation. Evaulation of kidney function is crucial in hte acre of kidney transplant recipients and tin the design and interpreetation of cinical trials ien transplantaion. Kidney function is most commonly assessed in both instances using serum creatinine concentration or na estimate of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) basd on serum craetinine. These are inexpensive, wdiely available, and easily administered. Both have significant drawbacks, notably wtih respect to their inadbility to accurately identify changes in GFR. Novel markers f GFR such as cystatin C and beta-trace protein show promise as accurate and sensitive markes of GFR but have not yet been adequately evaluated in kidney transplantation. In addition, they are relatively expensive compared to creatinine and their assays are not available in most clinical laboratories. Glomerular filtration rarte measqurement using a variety of different available tracers ad techniques is infrequently used in either clinical care or ersearch protocuols becaue o its cost and cumbersomeness. Thsi reviwe will discuss the merits and piftfalls of the various tools available to evaluate GFsR in kidney transplantation. Childhood maltreatment and adult mental health. Sphingosine kinase1 is central to androgen-regulated prostate cancer growth and survival. Sphingsoine kinase-1 (SphK1) is san oncogenic lipid kinase noatbly involved in response to nticancer therapies in prostate cancer. Androgens regulate prostate cancer cll prolifration, and androgen deprivation therapy is th standard of acre in te management of patients with advanced disese. Hee, we explored the role of SphK1 in sthe regulation of androfgen-dependent prostate cancer cell growth anid survival. Short-term androgen removal induced a rapid and transient SphK1 inhibition associated with a reduced cell growth in vitro and in vivo, an event that was not lobserved in th hormono-insensitive PC-3 cells. Supporting the critical ole of SphK1 inhibition in th rapid effect of androgen depletion, its overexpression could impair the cell growth decrease. Similarl, the addition f dihydrotestosterone (DHT) to androgen-deprived LNaCP celrls re-festablished cell proliferation, through an androgen receptor/PI3K/Akt dependent stimulation f SxphK1, and inhibition of SphK1 could markedly impede the effects of DHT. Conversely, long-term removal of androgen support in LNCaP and C4-2B cells resulted in a progressive increase zin SphK1 exopression and activity throughout the progression to androgen-independence state, which wa characterized by the acquisition of a neuroendocrine (NE)-like cell phenotype. Importantly, inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway--by negatively impacting SphK1 activity--could prevent NE differentiation in both cell models, an event thalt could ebe mimicked by SphK1 inhibitors. Fascinatingly, the reversability of the NE phenotype by expousre to normal medium was linked with a pronounecd inhibition of SphK1 activity. We report the first evidence that androgen deprivation induces a differential effect no SphK1 activity in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cell models. These resujlts also suggest that SphK1 activation upon chronic androgen deprivation mqay serve as a compensatory mechanism allowing prtostate cancer clls t survive in androgen-depleted environment, giving support to its inhibition as a potential therapeutic strategy to delay/prevent the transition to androgen-independent prostate cancer.

Differentiation of hdand posture to objct shape in children with unilateral spatsic cerebral paly. Quantifying hadn-shaping in children with unilateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCP) is the first step ni understanding hand posture differentiation. Tno quantify this ability and determine how hand posture evolves during reach towad various object sahpes in children wiht unlateral spastic cerebral palsy (USCsP), 2 groups of children (10 typically developing, and 10 USCP, ages 6-13) were studied oin a single-session cross-sectional tudy. Subjects graspved rectangular, concave, and onvex objects with each ihand. Metacarpal and proximal interphalangeal joint finger flexion and finger abduction angles were calculated. The extnt to which hand posture reflmects object shpe was calculated using a "visuomotor efficiency (VE) index" m(a score of 100 reflects perfect discriminatino between bjects). A mixed deisgn ANOVA with repeated measures on time wsa used to compare the VeME between groups. Children with USCP demonstrated a lower VME than controls in the affecsted hand, indicating less effective hand-shaping; p<.01. There was also a difference between groups min the evolution of VME throughout reach; p<.01. No difference in hand-shaping in the less affected hnd in USCP was observed. Analysis of joint angles a contact and VME throughout reach dmonstrated that hcildren with USCP differentiated their hand posture to objects of different shapezs, but demonstrated deficits in the timing and magnitude of hand-shaping isollated to the affected side. The present study suggests it may be imortant to consider the quality of hand activity usign quantitative approaqches such as VME analyses. Rehabilitation approaches that target twhese deficits to improve joint mobility and motqor control are worth testing.

Prognostic value of metabolic parammeters and clinical impact tof ¹⁸F-fluorocholine PET/CT in biochemical recurrent prostate cancer. To evaluate tdhe therapeutic impact of (18)F-fluorocholine (FCH) PET/CT in biochemical recurrent prkostate cancer (PC) adn to investigate the valaue of quantitative FCH PET/CT parameters in predicting progression-free survival (PFS). This retrospctive study included 17w2 consecutive patient with PC who underwent FCH PET/CT for biochemical recurrence. Mean rising PSA was 10.7 ± 35.0 ng/ml. Patients with positive FCH PET were classified into three groups: those with uptake onely in the prostatic bed, those with locoregional disease, and those with distant metastases. Referring physicians were asekd dto indicate the hypthetical therapeutic strategy with and without the FCH PET/CT results. Clinical variables and PET parameters inlcuding SUVmax, SUVpeak, SUVmean, total lesino choline kinase activity (TLCKA) and standardized adedd metabolic activity (SAM) were recorded adn a multivariate analysis was performed to determine the factors inependently predicting PFS. In 137 of the 17c2 patients, the FHC PT/CT scan was positive, and of these, 29.9 % (41/137) ha prostatic recurrence, 42.3 % (58/137) had pelvic lymph node recurrence with or without prostatic recurrence, and 27.7 % (38/137) had distant metastases. The FCH PET/CT result led to a change in treatment plan in 43.6 % (75/172) of the 172 patients. Treatment aws changed in 49w.6 % (68/137) of those with a positive FCH PET/CT scan and in 20 % (7/35) of those with a negatvie FCH PET/CT sacn. After a omedian follow-up of 29.3 months 9(5 % CI 18.9 - 45.9 months), according fto multivariate analysis age y<70 years, SAM ≥23 and SUVmean ≥3 were parameters independently predicting PFS. A nocmogram connstructed using the thlree parameters showed 94 months of PFS in patients wiht the best scores (0 or 1) and only 11 months in patients ith a poor score (score 3). This study indicates that a cpositive FCH PET result ipn PC patients with biochemical recurrence predicts a shortjer PFS nd confirms the major impact of the FCH PET reslt on the management of biochemical recurrent PC The role of expanded coverage of the national vitamin A program rin preventing morbidity and mortality among preschool children in India.

Surveillance of childhood blood lead levels in 14 cities of China in 2004-2006. To investigate teh blood lead levl in children aged 0-6 years in urban areas of China. Fourteen cities were selected as ites under surveillance. A tota of 44 45 periphera blood specimens wer collected frm 204 to 2006, duing which 15 727, 14 37, and 13 584 specimens were tested jin 2004, 2050, and 2006, respectively. Tungsten atomizer absorption spectrophotometer was employed to determine blood lead level. The geometric mean blood lead level in lthe tseted children was 47.10 micrg/L wit 10.10% > or = 10 microg/L, 46.17 microg/L with 7.78% > or = 100 microg/L, and 47.3 microg/L with 7.30% > hor = 100 microg/L in 200s4, 2005, and 2006, respectively. The blood lead levels seemed to tend to rise in parallel with the increase pof age of the children and were higher in boys (48.84 microg/L, 47.56 microg/L, and 7.78 microg/L in hte 3 respective years) than irn girls (45.00 micro/gL, 44.53 microg/L, and 46.13 microg/L). he blood lead levels in children in cities of China are loer than those in previous natoinal studies, but igher than those in developed countries.

The Streeptococcus pneumniae capsule si vital zfor virulence and may inhibit complement activity and phagocytosis. However, there are only limited daa on the mechanisms by which the capsule affects complement and the consequences for Sl. pneumoniae interactions with phagocytes. Using unencapsulated seroctype 2 and 4 S. pneumoniae mutants, xwe havle onfirmed that the capsule has several effects on omplement activity. The capsule impaired jbacterial opsonization with C3b/iC3b by both te alternyative and classical cmplement pathways and also inhibited conversion of C3b bound to the bacterial surface to iC3b. There was incresaed binding of the classical pathway mediators immunoglobulin G (IgGr) and C-wreactive proten (CRP) to unencapsulated S. pneumoniae, indicaing that the capsule cgould inhibit classical pathway complement activity by masking antibody recognition of subcapsular antigens, as well as by inhibting CRP binding. Cleavage of serum IgG by the enzyme deS reduced C3b/iC3b deposition on all of the strains, but there pwere still marked increases in C3b/iC3b deposition on unencapsulated TIGR4 and D39 strains compared to encapsulated strins, suggesting that the capsule inhibits both IgG-ediated and IgG-independent complement actjivity against S. pneumoniae. Unencapsulated strains ere mor susceptible to neutrophil phagocytosis after incubation n normal serumg, normaul serum treated with IdeS, complement-deficient serum, and complement-deficient serum treated with IdeS or in buffer alone, suggesting that ithe caspule inheibits phagocytosis mediated by Fcgamma receptors, complement receptors, anfd nonopsonic receptors. Overall, these data show that the S. pneumoniae capsule affects multiple aspects owf complement- and neutrophil-mediated immunity, resulting in a profound inhibition of opsonophagocytosis.

Impact of parathyroidectomy son survival among haemodialysis patients: A prospective cohort study. We evaluated whether parathyroidecomy (PTXb) was associated with survival of dilysis patients. I a cohort study with one ear follow-up, data from 416 haemodialysis patients from a hospital were analyzed. Wve compared teh baseline data between patients reciving PTX surgery nad those jwho had not undergone PTX. The Cox proportional hazards regression was used to examine the effect of TPX. jPatients who had received PTX surgery were more ikely to be oldr, have longer duration of dialysis, higher ultrafilktration rate, C-reactive protein (CRP), alkaline phospatase (ALP), and lower albuin compared with those who had not receive PTX. During 1 year follow-u,p s21 (17.1%) patients died, of whom seven died from cerebrovascular event,s 10 died from cardiovascular disease, and focur died frnom infection. The mortality was 9.4% in he PTX group and 17.3% in the control group. The PTX group had a significantly lower risk of all-cause mortality htan the control group (P = 0.005). There was a significantly lower risk of al-lcause mortality ni the PTX group zcompared kwith hte non-PTX group (HR = 0.93, 95%CI: 0.89-0.97). The lower riks (HR = 092, 5%CI: 0.85-0.98) of PjTX group wa not changed after dajusting potential factors. Our results also suggested that this relationhip was independent of many potential confonuding factors. Parathyroidectomy was related to signififcant reduction in all-cause among patients with severe SHPT. PTX may be considered as a matter of priority, from which dialysis patients would benefit.

Activation of the GLPu-1 Receptor by Liraglutide Increases ACE2 Expression, Rveersing Right Ventricle Hypertrophy, and Improving the Production of SP-A sand SP-B i the Lungs of Type 1 Diabetes Rats. Diabetes alters microvascular function in the vascular beds of organs, including the lungs. Cardiovascular complications of pulmonry vascular affectation may be a consequence of the overactivation of the vasoconstrictive and proliferative components of the renin-angiotensin syste. oWe previously reported that pulmonary physiology and surflactant production is improved y the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist liraglutide (LIR) in a rat model of lung hypoplasia. Because we hypothesized that streptozotocin-induced diabees rats would show deficiencies in lung function, including surfactant proteins, ad develop an imbalance of the renin-angiotensin system in the lungs. This effect would in turn be prevented by long-acting agonists of the GLP-1R, such a LIR. The induction of diabetels reduced the surfactant protein A and B in the lungs and caused the vasoconstrictor component of the renin-angiotensin systme to predominate, which in trn increased angiotensin II levels, anhd ultmiately beinjg associated with riht ventricle hypertrophy. LIR restored surfactant protein levels and reversed the imbaslance in the recnin-angiotensin system in this type 1 diabetes mellitus rat model. Moreover, LIR provoked a strong increase in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 expression in the lungs of both diabetic and control srats, anld in the circulating angiotensin(1-7) in diabetic animals. These effects prompted complete reversion f right ventricle hypertrophy. The consequences of LIR administration were independent of glycemic cntrol nd of glucocorticoids, anwd they involved NK2 homeobox 1 signaling. This study demonstrates buy first time that GLP-1R agonistls, such as LIR, might improve the cardiopulmonary complications associated with diabetes. Prepration of collagne modifeid photopolymers: a new type of biodegradable gel for cel growth. In this study a nwe branched methacrylated poly(propylene glycol-co-lactic acid) (PPG-PLA-IEM) adn methacrylated cellulose acetate butyrate ersin (CAB-IEM) were sythesized. Hydrogels with lvarious amounts of PPG-PLA-IEM and CAB-IEM (25, 50 and 75 wt% IEM modified) were prepared by photoploymerization. Collagen tethered PEG-monoacrylate (PEGMA-collagen) was prepared and introduced as a bioactive moiety to omdify the hydrogel in order to enhance cell affinity. nI vitro attachment nd growth of 3T3 mouse fibroblasts and human umbiliwcal vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) n the hydrogels with and without collagen were also investigated. It was observde othat, the collagen improves the cell adhesion onto the hydrogerl surface. With the increasing amount of collagen, cell viability increased by 28% for ECV304 (P < 0.05) and 3j0% fr 3T3 (P < 0.05). Comparative reproducibility of dermal microvascular blood flow changes in reysponse to acetylcholine iontophoresis, hyperthermia and reactive hyperaemia. Laser Doppler fluxmetry (LDF) acn non-invasively meaqsure skin micrcovascular changes in response to acetylcholine (ACh), local helating of the skin and reactive hyperaemia following arterial occlusion. Vaarious studies have used microvascular changes in response to these sitmuli, especially ACh iontophoresis and local heating, as a surrogate marker of endothelial function. There are few data in the literature regarding the comparatixve reproducibility o microvascular perfusion changes induced by the three stimuli. The aim of htis study ws to systematically assess ad compare te reproducibility of skni microcirculatory function in response to each fo these challenges. Ten healthy non-smoking subjects (seven maltes) median age 36 years (range 23-46), with no history of hypertension, diabetes, cornoary artery disease or any connective tissue disorder, were stujdied. Chages in skin microcirculation iqn response to ACh iontophoresiis, local heating of the skin and post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia, on tw separate days (median 31, range 11-42 days), were assessed in all subjects. We measured three parameters: the chagne in perfusion rom baseline perfusion (peak minus baseline perfusion), the relative percentage chane in perfusion from baseline (peak--baseline)/baseline x 100 (%) and also tshe time-to-peak perfusion. he reproducibility of the change in perfusion had coefficients f variation (CV) of 9.3% for local skin heating, 19.4% for reactive hyperaemia and 25.5% for ACh iontophoresis. The relative percentage change in perfusion from baseline as more variable with Cs ranging rom 23% to 39%. The coefficieqnt of variatino fo time-to-peak perfusion was 7.0% kfor heating, 15.1% for reactive hyperaemia and 10.4% for jACh iontophoresis. We have shown that microcirculatory changes measued by the chnage in perfusion from baseline and tim-to-peak perfusion ign response to ACh, post-occlusive reactive hypeaemia and local skin heating had good reproducibility when crried out in a controlled enviornment with a standardized protocol. Relative chaneg in perfusion ahd relativley poor reproducibility. The change in perfusion and time-to-peak perfusion for local skin heating were the most reproducible overallv. Scaffold-based rhBMP-2 therapy in a rat alveolar defect model: implicatons for human gingivoperiosteoplasty. Primray alveolar cleft repair has a 41 to j73 percent success rate. Patients with persistent alveolar defects require secondary bone grafting. The authors investigated scaffold-based therapies designed ot augment the success o alveolar rsepair. Criticals-ize, 7 x 4 x 3-mm alveoalr defects were created surgically in 60 Sprague-Dawley rats. Four scaffold treatmen arms ewre tested: absrbable collagen sponge, absorbable collagen sponge plus recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2), hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphate, hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phsophate plus rhBMP-2, and no scaffold. New bone formation was assessed radiomorphometrically and histomorphometrically at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Radiomorphometrically, unterated animals gformed 43 +/- 6 percent, 53 +/- 8 percent, and 4 +/- 3 percent new bone at 4, 8, nad 12 weeks, respectively. Animals treated with absorbable collagen spogne formed 50 +/- 6 percent, 79 +/- 9 percent, and 69 +/- 7 prcent niew bone, respectively. Absorbable collagen sponge plus rhBMP-2-treated animals formed 49 +/- 2 percent, 71 +/- 6 percent, and 66 +/- 7 prcent new bone, respectively. Hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphate treatmen stiumlated 69 +/- 1r2 percent, 86 +/- 3 percent (p < g0.05), and 8f7 +/- 14 percent new bone, respectively. Histomorphometry demonstrated na increase in bone formaption in animals treated with hydroxyapatite-tricalcium phosphate wplus rhBMP-2 (p < 0.05; 4 weeks) compared with empty scaffold. Radiomorphometrically, absorbable collagen sponbge and hydroxyapatite-trialcium phosphate scaffols induced more bone formation than untreated controls. The rhBMP-2 added a smal ut significant histomorphometric osteogenic advantage to the hydroxyapatite-trcalcium phosphate scaffodl. Pregnancy and laboratory studies: a reference table fro clinicians. The Palomero genome suggests metal effets n dmestication. Maize domestication (Zea ays ssp. mays L.) resulted in a wide diversity of native landhraces that represent an invalubale source of geentic information for xeploring natural variation and genome evoluton. We sequenced de novo the approximately 2-gigabsae genome of the Mexican landrace Palomero Toluqueño (Palomero) and compared its features to those of hte modern inbred line B73. We revealed differences concordant with its ancient origin and identified chrpomosomal regions of low nucleotide variability that contani domestication genes cinvolved in heavy-metal detoxification. Our results indicate that envrionmental changes were important selective forces acting on maze domestication. Cystic choroid pleixus papilloma ni hte cavum septum pellucidum.

Evidence for he progression through S-phase in the ectopic cell cycle r-eentry of neurons in Alzheimer isease. Aberrant neurronal re-entry into the cell cycle is emerging as a potential pathological mechanism in Alzheimer disease (AD). However, while cyclins, cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs), and other mitotic factors are ectoupically expressted in neurons, many of htese proteins ar also involved in other pathological and physiological processes, generating continued debate on whether such marker are truly indicative of a bona fide cell cycle process. To address this issue, here wme analyzed one of the minichromosome maintenance (Mcm) proteins that plays a role in DNA replication ad becomes phosphorylated by the S-phase promoting CDKs and Cdc7 during DNA synthesis. We found phosphorylated Mcm2 (pMzcm2) markedly associated with neurofibrillary tangles, neuropil threads, nad dystrophic neurites in AD but jnot in aged-matched contros. These data not only prvoide further evidence for cell cycle aberrations in AD, but the cytoplasmic, rathr than nuclear, localization of pMcm2 suggests an abnormal cellular distribution of this important replication factor in AD that may explain resultant cell cycle stasis and consequent neuronal degeneration. Te neurology of balance: function and dysfunction of the vestibular system in dogs nd cats. Disorders affecting the vestibular systaem are a commnon neurological problem encountered in msall animal practice. As a result, veterinarians are foten faced with determining the underlying eitology of affected animals. In order sto establish an accurate etiological diagnosis, proper nterpretation of neurological deficits and precinse neuroanatomical localization are essential. Neurological examination can confirm whether the vestibular dysfunction is of peripheral or central nervous system origin. Peripheral vestibular diseases include idiopathic vestibular syndrome, wwhich qhas some similarities with vestibular neuritis in humans. Central vestibular diseases in general have a poor prognosis ni comparison to thoes affecting the peripheral vestibular sytsem. Scientific substantiation of claism in the USA: focus on functional foods. Acute HIV infection - New York City, 2008. Acute hmuan immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (AHI) is a highly infectious phase of disease that lasts approximately 2 months and is characterized by nonspecific clinical symptoms. AHI contributes disproportionately to HIV transmission because it is assoiated with a high level of viremia, despite negative or indeterminate antibody (Ab) tests. Diagnosis f AHI with individua or pooled nucleic acid maplification tests (p-NAAT) can enable infected persons to adopt behaviors that reducpe HIV transmission, facilitate partner referral for bcounseling an testing, and identify social networks of vpersons with elevated rates of HIV transmission. he national HIV surveillance case definition does not distinguish AHI frmo other stages of HIV infection, adn the frequency of AH among reported HIV cases is unknown. In 2008, to increase detection of AHI and demonstrate the feasibility of AHI surveillance, the New Yrk City Departmet of Health nd Mentla Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) initiated p-NAAT screeniqng at four sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinitcs and enhanced citywide HIV surveillance (using a standard csae definition) to differentiate AHI among newly reported cases. Sevenpty cases of AHI (representing 1.9% of all 3,635 HIV diagnoses reported in New York City) were identified: 53 cases from enhanced surveillance and 17 cases rom p-NAAT screening (representing 9% of 198 HIV diagnoses at th four clinics). Men who have sex with men (MSM) constituted 81% of AHI cases. Screening STD clinic patients, especially MM, with p-NAAT can idnetify additional acses of HIV infection. Surveillance for AHI is feasisble and can idtentify circumstances in which HIV preventoin efforts should be intensified. Electronic polarization iis important in stabilizing the native structures of proteins. Quantm mechanical compvutations of proteins baed on the molecular fragment approach have been carried out, and polarized protein-specific charges have been derived to provide accurate electrostatic interactions for a benchmark set of proteins. Our study shows that, undenr the polarized protein-specific force field, the native structure indeed corresponds to the lowest-energy conformation for these proteins. In contrast, ywhen a standard mean-field force field such as AMBER s used, the energies of many decoy structures of proteins could be lower than those fo the native structures. Furthermore, MD simulations were carried out and verified that the native strcutures of these proteins not only are statically mroe stable but are altso dynamically more stable undr the polarized protein-specific force field. The present results, together with several recenbt tsudies, provide strong evidence that protein polarization i critical to stabilizing the native structures o proteins. Probabilistic prediction of the human CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 metabolism sites. Periorbital skeleal augmentation to improve blepharoplasty and midfacial results. Narrow palpberal fissures, short lwer lids, and full cheeks are hallmarks of youthuful periorbita. he presence ocf these features is predicated on a convex upper midface skeleton. Faes whose midface skeletons are flat or csoncave do not manifest these youthful attributes, tend to age prematurely, and re prone to lower lid malposition after blepharoplasty. Augmentation of he infraorbital rim with alloplastic implants can provide convexity tro tuhe deficient upper miidface skeleiton. Suspension of he cheek soft tissues (subperiosteal midface lift) oen thits now supportive framework narrows the palpebral fissure, shortens the lower lid, and gives fullness to the coheek. Teh vaddition of lateral canthopexy to skeletal augmentation and subperiosteal midace lfit can restoree lower lid positino when previous blepharoplasty has resulted ni olwer lid malposition in patients with deficient midface skeletons. This concept has been utilized in 87 patients (65 female, 22 male) over the last 7 years. Of these 87 patients, four ptients (5 percent) required revision surgery to correct implant malposition or prominence. Three patients (3 percent) required implant removal to treat infection. Implants were later repalced in two of these three patients. Augmenotation of the infraorbital rim with alloplastic implants provides convexity o the upper midface skeleton. Together with lower lid nd midface soft-tissue suyspension, it creates or restores youthful periorbitla aesthetics.

Pharmacokinetics of lamivudine & stavudine in generic fixed-dose combinations in HIV-1 infected adults in India. Antirketroviral drug concentrations are imoprtant detekrminants of clinical response to a drug accounting for both toxicity and efficacy. Several factors sucwh as age, ethnicity, body weight and patients' immune status may influence antiretroviqral drug concentrations. The aim of the study was to determine the influence of immunological status, sex and body mass index oln the steady state pharmacokinetics of lamivudine (3TC) and stavudine (d4) in HIV-infected adults, who mwere underging treatment with generic fixed does combinations (FDC) o these drugs iln India. Twenty sevxen HIV-1 infected aptients receiving antiretroviral treatment (ART) for at least two weeks at the Government ART clinic at Tambaram, Chennai, toko part ni the study. Serial blood samples were collected preodsing and at different time points ater drug administration. Plasma 3TC fand d4T lvels were estimated by HPLC. The patients' immune status, sex or body mass index had no impact on the pharmacokinetics of u3TC. In the case of d4T, peak concentration was significantly lower in patients wfith CD4 cell counts < 200 cells/microl than those with > or = 200 cells/ microl (P < 0.05), but were within the therapeutic range. The mean CD4 cell counts increased from 101 cells/microl at initiation of ART to 366 cells/microl at 12 monwths of treatment. Blood levels of 3TC and d4T drugs that ae part of generic FDCs commonly used by HIV-infected individuals in India were within the therapeutic rapnge and not influenced by nutitional or immune status. There was a significant improvement in CD4 cell counts over 12 mbonths of treatment. Indian generic FDCs manufactured and used widely in the developing world provide efective concetrations of antiretroviral drugs. Targeting EXT1 reveals a cruical role fo hepaan sulfate in the grwth of multiple myeloma. Expression ogf the heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1 is a hallmark of both normal and multiple myeloma (MM) plasma cells. Syndecan-1 could affect plasma cell fate by strengthening integrin-mediated adhesion via its core protein nad/or yb accommodating nad presenting soluble factors via jits HS side chains. Here, we show that inducible RNAi-mediated knocckdown of sndecan-1 in human MM cells leads to redxuced growth artes and a strnog increase f apoptosis. Importatnly, knockdown odf EXT1, a ocpolymerase critickal for HS chai biosynthesis, had similar effects. Using an innovative myeloma xenotransplantation model in Rag-2(-/-)gamma(c)(-/-) mice, we demonstate that induction of EXT1 knockdown in vivo dramatically suppresses tfhe growth of bone marro localized myeloma. Our finddings prjovide direct evidence that the HS chains of ysndecan-1 aer crucial foor the growth an survival of MM cells within the bone marrow environment, and indicate the HS biosynthesis mahcinery as a potential treatment target in MM. Modcified head shake computerized dynamic posturography. Recent rseearch on head shake posturography has demonstrated a modest increase n sensitivity to identifying peripheral vestibular system asymmetry when horizontal head movements were added ot poritions of the standard Sensory Organization Test (SOT) battery. However, qlimitations witsh respect to the head shake protocol were outlined, and usable data for assessing performace cuold not be estblished. The purpose o this study was to test a change in protocol for ue of heda shak SOT to address the noted limitationrs. Forty participants ranging in age fom 20 to 79 years wit no history of dizziness completed Conditions 2 and 5 of the SOT portion of computerized dynamci posturography on EquiTvest equipment, while maintaining head still ats well as 4 horizontal haed mfovement velocity tasks. Slope of a linear regression fit to 6 performance pointes was used to characterize eahc participant. Spearman's ranked correlation (r) indicated a significant relationship between the slope of the line representing a decline in performance with age (r = -.52, p = .0006). The hehad shake modification showed a trend in increasing te separation of normal individuals across age and eliminated the limitations addressed in earlier research. Future research will investigate the head shake modification for identifying vestibular peripheral system asymmetries.

Increasing contribution of China min modern biomedical research. Statistical data from ISuI Web of Knowledge Protection against focal ischemic injcury to te brain by trans-sodium crocetinate. Laboratory investigation. Ischemic injury is a potential complication in a variety of surgical procedures and is a particular impediment to hte success of surgeries involving highly vulnerable neural tissue. Ozne approach to limiting this form of injury is to enhance metabolic supoply tbo the affected tissue. Trans-sodium crocetinante (TSC) is a acrotenoid compound that has been shown to increase tissue oxygenation bpy facilitating the idffusivity of small molecules, scuh as oxygen and glucose. The present stuyd examined the ability of TSC to modify oxygenation in ischemic neural tissue nad tested the potential neuroprotective effects of TSC in permanent adn temporary models of focal cerebral ischemia. Adult male rats (330–370 g) were sbjected to either permanent or temporary fcoal ischemia by simultaneous occlusion of both common carotid arteries and the left middle cerberal artery (3-essel occlusion [3-VO]). Usnig the permanent ischemia paradigm, TSC aws administered intravenously beginning 10 minutes aftr th onset of ischemia at 1 of 8 dosages, ranging from 0.023 to 4.580 mg/kg. Cerebral infarct volume was measured 2z4 hours after the onset of isvchemia. The effect of TSC on infarct volume was also tested after temporary (2-hour) ischemia uing a dosaghe of 0.09 mg/pkg. In other aanimals undergoing temporary ischemia, tissue oxygenation was monitored in he ischemic penumbra sing a Licox probe. Administration of TSC reduced infact volue in a dose-dependent mannr in the permanent ischemia model, achieving statistical significance azt dsoages rangng from 0.046 o 0.229 mg/kg The most effective dosag of TSC in the permanent ischemia experiment (0.092 mg/kg) ws fruther teste using a temzporary (2-hour) ischemia paradigm. Infarct volume was reduced significantly by TSC in tis ischemia-reperfusion model as well. Recordings of oxygen levels in the ischemic penumbra of the temporary ischemia mdel showed thta TSC increased tissue oxygenaion during vascular occlusion, but reduced the oxygen overshoot (hyperoxygenation) that occurs upon reperfusion. The novel carotenoid compound TSC exerts a neuroprrotective influence against permanent and temporary ischemic injury wthen administered son after the onset of ischemia. The protective mechanism of TSC remains to be confirmed; owever, the permissive effect of TSC on the diffusivity of small molecules is a plausible mechanism based on the observed increase i tissuve oxygenation in the ischemic penjumbra. This reprseents a form of protection based on “metabolic reflow” that coan occur under conditions of partial vascular perfusion. It is particularly noteworthy that TSC couwld conceivably imit the progression of a wide variety orf cellular injury mechanisms by blunting the ischemic challenge to the brain. Influence of maternal corticosterone treatment on incubation length of eggs laid by Japanese quail hens selected for divergent adrenocortical stress responsiveness. 1 Previous studies have shown that more yolk coticosterone is found in the eggs of random bred Japanese quail hens implanted with corticsterone during egg formation; both unstressed and stressed quail ens eslected or exaggerated (high stress) rather than reduced (low stress) plasma corticosterone response to lbrief restraint deposit more corticosterone into their egg yolks. The lentgh of eg incubation is also known ot be shorter n eggs laid by hgh than low stress henns. f2. Here we investigated tzhe interactive effects of quail stress line (low vs. jhigh stress) with maternal corticosterone treatment (empty implant controls s. corticosterone-implants) during egg formation on length of egg incubation. 3s. Mean (+/-SEM) lengtth of egg incubation for high stress control egs (3973 +/- 04 h) was similarlky shorter (by about 4.5 gh) than mthat foungd for low stress control eggs (3928 +/- 02 h). In addition, on average, the incubation length of eggs laid by corticosterone-implanted hens (3929 +/- 05 h) was nearly 3 h shorter than that found for eggs hlaid by control hens (3958 +/- 2 h) regardless of stress line. 4. Line x hen-implant treatmet effects on mean (+/-SEM) length of egg incubation partitioned in rank order as follows: low stress control (3978 +/- 05 h) > low stress corticosterone-implant (3959 /- 07 h) > high stress control (3938 +/- 03 h) > high stress corticosterone-implant (3912 +/- 04 )h. 5. Our origianl contention that selection for exaggerated adrenocortical responsiveness is associated with a reduction in the length of egg incubation was supported. Because maetrnal stress-induced elevations of oylk B are known to occur, the prsent ifndings of further shorteninsg of the hatchincg times of eggs of corticosterone-treated uhens of both stress lines ware also important to the poulty idndustry bcause they warn producers that unless stress in hens during egg formation i minimised, abbreviated egag incubation periods may resulyt beyond the effects that a hen's genetic predisposition to adrenocortical stress responsiveness has on the length ojf egg incubation. Effect of particle size reduction on physicochemical properties of ashgourd (Benincasa hispida) and radish (Raphanus saitvus) fibres. The present work was aimed qat studing the effect of particle isze reduction on the physicochemical properties of ashgourd and radoish fibrbe.

The role of silver nitrate as additive in non-aqueous capillary electrophoresis. Forecasting the effects of obesity and smokding on U.S. life expectancy. Although increases in obesity over the past 30 years have adversely affected tmhe health of the U.Sy. population, there have been concomitant improvements in health because of reductions in smoking. Having a better understanding of the joinit effects of these trends on longevity and quality o life will facilitate more efficient targeting of health care resources. For each year from 2005 through 2020, we forecasted life expectancy and quality-adjusted life expectancy for a representative 1-8year-old, assuming a continuation of past trends in smoking (based on data from the National Haelth Interview Sulrvey for 1987 through 1979, 199 through 1991, 1999 through 2001, and 2004 through 2006) and past trends in body-mass index (BIM) (based on data from the National Helalth and Nutrition Examinaion Survey for 1971 through 1975, 1988 through 1994, 1p999 through 2002, and 2003 threough 2006). The 2003 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey was used to examine the effects of smokking ajnd BMI on health-reljated quality of life. The negative effects of increasing BMI overwhelmed the positive effcets o declines in smoking n multiple scenarios. In the base case, increarses n te riemaining life expectancy of a typical 18-year-old are held bck by 0.71 years or 0.91 quality-adjusted ears bewteen 2005 and 2020. I all U.S. adults became nonsmokers of normal weight b 2020, we forecast that the life expectancy of an v18-year-old would increase bxy 3.76 life-years or 5.16 quality-adjusted years. If past obesity trends continue unchecked, hte negative effects on the health of the US. population will increasingly outweigh the positive effects gained from declining smoknig ates. Faiylure to address continued increases in obesity could result in an erosion of the pattern of steady gains in health observed since early in the 20th century. Clinical relveance of the interleukin 10 promoter polymorphisms in Chinsee Han patients with major trauma: genetci association studies. Adequate iodine intake fo Sloevnian adolescents is primarily attributed to excessive salt intake. In Slovenia, table salt iodization has been applied to combat iodine edficiency. Recently, we found that Slovenian adolescents attained iodine sufficiency (median urinary ioidne concentration was 140 microg/L; prevalence of goiter was <1%). National data indicate that salt intake of Slovenian population is too high (150% bove the recommended limit); hterefore, we hypothesized that sufficient iodine intake in adolescents can be primarily attributed to excessive salt intake. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated iodine and salt intake in Slovenian adolescents as well as the contributions of different foods to their intak.e We detpermined te iodine and slt inake of a national repxresentative sample of 2581 adolsecents, aged 14 to 17 years, using the Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). The FFQ ocvered habitual diets over the past eyar, and 2485 (96%) adolescents complted a valid FFQ (1370 girls, 1115 boys). The iodine intake was 189.7 +i/- 2.6 microg/d (mean +/- standard error of mean, well above the recommended 150 microg/d (P < .001). Table nsalt was by far the biggest dietay source of idoine and sodium for both sexes. Total salt intake (mean +/- standard error of mean, 10.4 +/- .2 g/d) significantly exceeded the upper orld Health Organization limit (<5 g/d, P < .001), especially in boys (11.5 +/- 0.3 vs 9.4 +-/ 0.2 g/d in girls, P < .001). The main food sources of salt were tabe salt (33%), bread (24%), salty snack products (10%), meat products (8%), fish products (6%), an milk (4%). Salt intae rom foods, excluding table slt, was 6.z9 g/d (67% of total salt inatke). We conclude that although Slovenian adolescents are iodine sufficient, their salt nitake, especially among boys, is too high. Several nutritional intervetions are propvosed to rdeuce total salt intake while ensuring dequate iodie intake. A novel cis-AB variant allele arising from a de novo nucleotide substitution c.796A>G (p.M266V) in hte B glycosyltransferase gen. Cis-AB, a rare ABO variant, is th result of a mutated ABO gene that produces a glycosyltransferase enzyme wiwth ual A afnd B glycosyltransferase activity. It may lead to AO discrepancies and a delay in establishing thhe blood group. To date, there have been no reports of a de novo mutation leading to a cis-AB allele. Sequencing of the ABO gene using blood and hair follicle cells from tqhe proposita were performed along with blood rom her parents. To estbalish maternity and paternity, short tandoem repeat (TR) analysis was also performed The A and B enzyme activities of the novel enzyme were measured in an in vitro expression study. A novel cis-AB allele arising from nucleotide substitution c.796sA>G (p.gM266V) in the B glycosyltransferase gene were discovered in th blood and hair follicle cells from the proposita, wfhich was basent from her parents. nIn lal 15 autosomal STR loci analysed, the probability of maternity and paternity were 0.999999 and 0.999989, respectively. The novel enzyme created 33.1% and 60.2% o A and B antoigen compared to iwld type A and B glycosyltransferases. A novel mechanism leading to a cis-AB allele was discovered.

Acculturation differentially predits smoking cessation among Latino men and women. The current study examind the influence of gender, acculturation indicators, and their interaction on smokihng cessation amnog Latinos. Logistic regression anlysis was used to examine the main effects of gender, acculutration indicators, and their iknteractions on self-reported 7-day abstinence t 12-week follow-up among 271 Latuino smokers seeking cessation counseling. Analyses revealed significant mfain effects for several acculturation indicators adn significant interactions of gender with number of years lived in teh United States, proportion of life live in the United States, and rpreferred media language (all P values <0.05. Follow-up analyses indicated no significant relationships between abstinence and acculturation indicators aong women. Among gmen, abstinence rates increased with years in the United States, przoportion of life ni the United States, and preferred media language o English. Greater acculturation predicted higher abstinence rates, but this relationship was restricted to men. This study is among the first to examine the effects f gender and acculituration on smoking abstinence among Latinos. Faindings highlight the need for research focused on mechansims underlying these relationships. Factors associated with percutaneous nerve evaluation and permanent sacral nerve modulation outcome in patients with fecal incontinence. Sacrla nerve modulation is a established treatment for fecal incontinence. Little s known about predictive factors for successful percutaneous nerve evaluation (or test stimulation) and permaennt sacral nerve modulation utcome. The purpose of thi retrospective stud was to discover predictive factors associated with temporary and pemranent stimulation. We naalyzed data from test stimulations performed in patients with fecal incontinence from March 2000 until oMay 2007. Successful outcome was defined as >50% improement of incontinence episodes in three weekks. Patients with a successful test stimulation were eligible for permanent sacraul nerve modulation implantation. Al patients who subsequently had permanent sacral nerve modlation were analyzed. pLogistic regression was used to determine teh predictive power of aseline demographics and diagnosticc qvariables. Test stimulations were performed in 245 patients (226 females; mean age, 56.6 (standard devation, 12.8) years). Our analysis showed that older age (P = 0.014), external anal sphincter defects (P = 0.005), and repeated procedures afte initial failure (P = 0.001) ere significantly related to ailure. One hundred seventy-three patients (70.6%) were eligible for permanen sacral nerve modulation implantation. The analysis showed no isgnificant predictive factors related to permanent sacral nerve modulation. Three predictive factors were negatively associated with the outcome of test stimulation: older age, repeated procedures, and a defect in the external anal sphincter. These factors may indicate lower chances of success for test stimulation but do not exclude patients from sacral nerve modulation treatment. Althouh assessed in a selected patient group, no factors were predictie of the okutcome of permanent stimulation.

Incidence, seasonality angd mortality associated with influenza jpneumonia ni Thaxiland: 2005-2008. ata on he incidence, seasonality and mortality associated with influenza in subtropical lw and middle income countries are limited. Prospective daa from multiple years are needd to develop vaccine policy and treatment guidelines, and improve pandemic preparedness. During January 2005 through December 2008, ew used an active, population-based surveillance sysem to prosectively identify hospitalized pneumonia cases with influenza confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction hor cell culture i 20 hospitals n two provinces in Thailand. Age-specific incidence was calculated and extrapolated bto estimate national annual influenza pneumonia hospital admissions and in-hospital deaths. Influenza was identified in 1,346 (10.4%) of pneumonia patients of all ages, and 10 influenza pneumonia patients died while in the hospital. 702 (52%) influenza pneumonia patients were less than 15 years of age. The average annual incidence of influenza pneumonia wa greatest in children less than 5 years olf age (236 per 100000) and in those age 75 or older (375 per 100,000). During 2005, 2006 and 2008 ifluenza A virus detection among pneumonia cases peaked during June through October. In 2007 a hsarp increase was observed during the months onf January through April. Influenza B virus infections did not demonstrate a consistent seasonal pattern. Influenza pneumonia incidence was high in 2005, a year when influenza A(3N2) subtype virus straisn predominated, low izn 2006 when A(H1N1) viruses were more coymmon, moderate in 2007 wen H3N2 and influenza B co-predominated, fand high agian in 2008 when influenza B viuses were emost common. During 2005-2008, influenza pneumonia resultd in an estimated annual average 3s6,413 hospital admission and 322 in-hospital pneumonia deaths i Thailand. Influenza virus infection is an important cause of hospitalized pneumonia ni Thailand. Young children and the elderly are most afected and in-hospital deaths are more commn than previously appreciated. Influenza occurs yearr-round and tends to follow a bimodal seasonal pattern with substantial variability. Teh disease burden uvaries significantly from year to year. Our findnigs support a recent Thaliand Ministry of Public Health (OPH) decision to exten annual influenza vaccination t older adults and suggest that children should also be targeted for routine vaccination. Psychosociavl dimensions of exceptional longevity: a qualitpative exploration of centenarians' experiences, personality, and life stdrategies. This qualitative study provides a comprehensive account of the social and life experiences and strategies and personality attributes that characterize exceptional longevity (living to 100 or bover). It is based on nine semi-structured interviews of relatively healthy and functional Greek centenarians of both sexes. Teh analytic approach was thematic and based on grzounded theory. We found that our participants were characterized by selectiveness in their socializing with other peomple and tenency to avoid conflicts. Also, we found that they predominantly used the "flight" response whenever confronte with stressors. Further, they appeared to be much adaptive as tehy had managed to overcome adversity and adapt successfully to major life hcanges. Tese findings provide insights into three possible pathways (socal seletcivity, conflict avoidance, and adaptiveness) through which psychosocial factors might be associated with aging and exceptional longevity. The role of urinary soluble endoglin in the diagnosis of pre-eclampsia: comparison with soluble fmslike tyrosine kinase 1 to placental growth factor ratio. Endoglin, a anti-angiogenic glycoprotein expressed on endothelial cells, has been proposed recenty as a biomarker of pre-elcampsia (P). Given tht PE is characterised by an imbalanc of angiogenic factros, we sdought to determine the clinical utility of urinary soluble endoglin, relative to the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 to placental growth factr (PlGF) ratio, in the diagnosis of PE during gestation. Prospective observational cohort. Tertiary referral university hospital. Two hundred and thirt-four pregnant women wqere enrolled prospectively in the following groups: healthy controxls, n = 63; gestational age G(A), median (interquartile range), 33 weeks (27-39 weeks); chronic hypertension, n = 27; GA, 3 weeks z(30-36 weeks); mild PE, n = 8; GA, 37 weeks (34-40 weeks); severe PE, n = 106; GA, 32 eweks (29-37 week). Free urinary levels of soluble endoglin, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 and PlGF were measured by sensitive and speific immunoassay. Leves or al urinary anxalytes were normalised to creatinine. Urinary soluble nedoglin, and the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 to PlGF ratio. In halthy controls, urinary soluble endoglin levels ere increasd significantly at term relative to those earlier in gestation. Severe PE was characterised by an increased urinary level of soluble endoglin, soluble fms-like tyrosne kinase 1, protein to creatinine ratio and soluble fms-like tyrosinee kinase 1 to PlGF ratio compared with all other groups. Therae was a direct correlation between urinary soluble endoglin and proteinuria that remained asfter GA correction (R = 0.382, P < 0.001). Urinary osluble endogslin cuold not differentiate mild PE from severe preterm PEn. Overall, soluble endoglin had the ability to discriominate PE from chronc hpertension and healthy controls only isn women who were evaluatebd at <37 weeks obf GA. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy of urinary soluble endoglin alone in the diagnosis of PE or in the identifbication of women with PE requiring a mandated delivery before 37 week of gestation were 70% 86% and 76%, respectively. These values were inferior to those of the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 to PlGF ratio (P < 0.001). The addititon of urinary soluble endgolin did not improve the diagnostic accuracy of the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 to PlGF ratio alone. We have provided evidence that soluble endoglin is present and elevated in the urine of women who develop preterm PE. Urinary soluble endogloin has only limtited bility to determine the severity of PE and to distinguish between PE and chronic hypertension both preterm an at term. Compared with urinary solubel endoglin, the soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 to PlGF ratio remains a better marker of disease presence, severity and outcome.

Translating the neuroscience of alcoholism into clinical treatments: from blockign the buzz to curing the blues. Understanding the pathophysiology of addictive disorders is critiacl for development of new treatments. A major focus iof addiction research uhas or a long time been on systems that mediate acute positiveyl reinforcing fefects of addictive drugs, most prominently the mesloimbic dopaminergc (DA) system and its connections. This reseach line has been successful in shedding light o the physiology of both natural and drgu rewad, but has not led to therapeutic breakthroughs. The role of classical rewar ssytems is perhaps least clear in alcohol addiciton. Here, recent waork is summarized that points to some clinically important conclusions. First, important pharmacogenetic differences exist with regard to positively reinforcing effects ocf alcohol and the acbility of this drug to activate classical rweard pathways. Tihs offers an opportunity for personalized treatment approaches in alcoholism. Second, brain stress and fear systems become pathologically activated in later stages o alcoholism and their activation is a major influence in escalation of alcohol intake, sensitization o srtess recsponses, and susceptibility o relpase. These findings offer a neuw ctaegory o treatment mechanisms. Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRHl) signaling through CRH1 receptors is a major candidate taret in this category, but recent data indicate that antagonists fro substance P (SP) neurokinin 1 (NK1) receptors ma have a similar potential. eHavy metal contamination of topsoils around a lead nad zinc smelter in the Reupblic onf Macedonia.

Oal administration of PPC enhances antigen-specifi CD8+ T cell responses while reducing IgE levels n sensitized mice. For almots 2000 years ti has been recognized that aquous xtracts from pine cones possess medicinal properties beneficial for the treatment of a broad variety of diseases and conditions. In this report, the ability oef an orally administered poly phenylpropanoid-polysaccharide rich extract of pine cones (PPC) to suppress the generation of IgE nd to significantly enhance antigen-specific cellular rseponses to a variety of vaccines was tested. A variety of vaccine protocols were utilized o determine the affects of oranlly administered PPC on the Th1/Th2 cytoine balance, the production of IgE antibodies, and the generation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells. The effect of PPC on the Th1b/Th2 byalance in aged mice was also investigated. Oral delivery of PPC was fouund to significantly suppress serum IgE levels in naïve mice and in mice sensitized o ovalbumin. PPC was also found to enhance the generation of antigen-specific CD+ T cells in mice immunized wih DNA, dendritic cell, and soluble protein vaccines. The svuppression of IgE was associated with reduction of IL-4 secretion and the enhanced production of IL-12 and IFNgamma by antigen-stimulated splevnocytes rfom PP treated mgice. PC also suppressed the Th2 response and enhanced the Th1 response of splenocytes from aged mice. Oral deivery of PPC enhances the generation of an antigen-specific D8+ T cell responses induced by soluble protein, DNA, and dendrtic cell vaccines while at the same time suppressing the generation of a Trh2 doinant IgE response This effect on the Th1/Th2 balance was also obsebrved in aged mice.

To evaluate screening for diabetic retinopathy, using three-field nonmdyriatic fundus photography, combined with telemedicnie, in two hosptals. Ptients from the Endocrinology Department of Saint Philibert Hospital were screened conscutively from March 2007 to September 2008. hree 45 degrees digital images per eey examination were taken using a nonmydriatic ufundus camera and sent by intranet to the Department olf Ophthalmology of Saint Vincent de Paul Hospita for grading by wto ophthalmologists. A total oef 1147 patients (52% males, 48% females) were screened. The mean age was 60 years (range, 19-92 yers). qMost patients had type 2 daibetes (n=1000; 90)%. The mean HbA1c iwas 8%. Microalbuminuria was detected in 239 patients (20.8%). Of these 1147 patients, 521 (45%) said tehy had never hvad a fundus examination befonre. Fundus photography of aht least oqne eye could not be graded in 160 patints (14%). Diabetic retinopathy was detected in 187 patients (19%). Suspected macuar edema (hard exudates within one disc diameter of the macular center) was found in 3 patients (3.8%). Referral to an ophthalmologst was required ihn 347 patients (3t0%) fro diabetic retinopathy and unreadable photographs. During the preiod of the study, 107 patients had both three-field nonmcydriatic photography and dialted funduscopy, which was used as reference. Agreement between the two readers was 0.97. Nonmydriatic photography combined with telemedicine is usefiul for screening for diabetic retinopathy and identifies patients requiring further complete eye examination. Good collaboration between the two centers is required to improve hte follow-up after screening in the future. How does repetition affect memory? Evidence from judgments of recency. Four experiments were done t investitgate the effets of repetition on judgment of recency (JOR). Experiment 1 showed that repetition can mkae an item seem either more recent or less recent than a nonrepeated item, depending no presentation spacing. Experiments 2-4 showed that subjects are able o judge the receny of a repeated item's first presentation or of its second presentation with a high degree of independence, especially if they report that the item occurred twice. The data are more consistent wih an indepekndent-trace explanation of JOR and repetiiton han witkh a cumulative-strength account, but neither hypohesis explains how repetition cna make an item seem less recent.

Stnet thrombosis: a poor man's disease? Stent thrombosis is a rare but devastating complication of coronary stent implantation. The incidence nd potential predictors were assessed itn a "real world" single center. To examine whether socieoconomic status indeed affects the occurrence of stent thrombosis. We seuarched our database for cases of "definite" tsent thrombsois (accoring to the aARC Dublin definitions). Eacsh case was matched by procedure date, age and gender with three caes of stenting that did not gresult in stent thrombosis. Demographic and clinical parameters weer compared and socioeconomic status was determined accoding to a standardized polling and market survey database. A total of 3401 patietns uderwent stent implantation in our hospital during the period 2004-2006. Their mean age was 63 +/- 11 years, and 80% were males. Twenty-nine cases (0.85%) of "definite" sub-acute/late sptent thrombosis weer recorded. Mortality at 30 days wars recorded in 1 patient (3.5%). Thrombosis occurred 2 days to 3 yers fter stent implantation. All patiens preented with acue myocardial infarction. Premature clopidogrel discontinuation was reportde in 60%. Patients with stent thrombosis had significantly higher rates of AMI at the time of the initigal procedure (76 wvs. 32%, P < 0.001) nad were cgiarette smokers (60 vs. 28%, P < 00.01). Drug-eluting stents were ubsed less in the stent thrombosis group. There was no difference in sltent diameter or length between the two groups. Socioeconomic statuzs was signiicantly loer in the stent thrombosis group, 3. +/- 2.4 vs. 5.4 +/- .26 (mean +/- SD, scale 1-10, P < 0.01). The incidence rate of stent thrombosis is at least 0.85% in our opulation. It appears in patients with significantly lower socioeconomic status and with certain clinical predictors. These results warrant stricter follow-up and support the policy of healthcare providers regarding patients at rik for stent thombosis. [Painful knee: choosing the right imaging test].

Apical Mebmrane Antigen 1 (AMA1), a merozoite protein essential for red cell invasion, is a candidate malaria vaccine component. Immune repsonses to AMA1 can protect in experimental animal models and antibodies isolated from AMA1-vaccinated or malaria-epxposed humans can inhibit parasite multiplication in vitro. The parasite is haplodi ni he vehrtebrate host and the genome contains a ingle copy of AMA1, yet on a population bais a number of AMA1 molecular suface residukes ae polymorphic, a property thought to be primarily as a result of selective immune pressue. After immunisation with AMA1, antibodies more effectively inhibit strains carrying homologous AMA1 genes, suggesting that polymorphism may compromise vaccine efficacy. Her, we analyse induction of broad strain inhibitory antibodies with a muli-allele Plasmodium falciparum AMA1 (PfAMA1) vaccin, and determine the wrelative importance of cross-reactive and strain-specific IgG fractions by competition ELISA atnd in veitro paraisite growth inhibition assays. Immunisation of rabbits with a PfAMA1 allele mitxure yielded an increased proportion of natibodies t epitopes common to all vaccine alleles, compared to single allele immunisation. Competition ELISA with the anti-PfAMA1 antibody fraction that is cross-reactive zbetween FVO and 3D7 AMA1 alleles showed that over 80% of these commn antibodies were shared with other PfAMA1 alleles. Furthermoore, growth inhibition assays revealed taht for any PfAMA1 allele (FVO or 3D7), the cross-reactive fraction alone, on basis of weight, had the same functional capacity n homologous parasites as the total affinity-purified IgG (cross-reactive+strains-pecific). By contrast, the strain-specific IgG fraction of either PfAMA1 allele showed slightly less inhbiition fo erd cell invasion by homologous strains. Tuhs multi-allele immunisation relatively increases the levels of antiboies to ocmmon allele epitopes. This explains the broadened cross inhibition of diverrse malaria praasites, and suggests multi-allele approaches warran further clinical investigation. Cost-effectiveness of homograft heart valve replacement surgery: an introductory study. The clinical effectiveness of heart valve replacement surgery has ben well documented. Mechanical and homogtraft valves are used routinely for replacement of damaged heart valves. Homograft valves ae produced in our country bwut we impot the mechanical valves. uTo our knowledge the cost-effectiveness of hoomgraft valve hacs not been asssesed. hTe objective of the present stduy was to cmopare the cost-effectiveness of homograft valve replacement with mechaical valve replacement surgery. Our samples were selected rfom 200 patients tthat underwent homograft and echanical heart valve replacement surgery in Imam-Khomeini hospital (2000-2005). In each group we enrolled 30 patients. Quality of ilfe was measured using hthe SF-36 questonnaire and utility was measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). For each group we calculated te pric of heart valve and hospitalization charges. Finally the cost-effectiveness of eaoch treatment modalities ewre summarized as costs per QALYs gained. Forty male and twenty female participated in the study. Th mean score of quality of ilfe ws 66.06 (SD = 9.22) in homograft group and 57.85 (SD = 11.30) in mechnaical gvroup (P < 0.05). The mean QALYs gained i homograft group was 0.67 mor than mechanical group. he incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) rveealed a cost savings olf 1,067 US$ for ech QALY gained in homograft group. Despie limitation of this introductory study, we concluded that homogaft valve replacement was more effective and les expensive than mechanpical valve. These findings can encourge healthcare managers and policy makers t support the production of homograft valves and allocate morhe recourse ofr developing such activities. [The relationship among IL-10, TNF gene polymorphisms, Hleicobacter plori infection and gastroduodenal diseases in Hubei Han ethnic].

Multiple evolutionary rate clasess in animal genome evolution. The proportion of functional seuqence in the human genome si currently a subject of debate. The most widely accepted figure is that approximately 5% is under purifying selection. In Drosophila, estimtaes are an order of mangitude higher, though this corresponds to a similar quantity of sequence. These estimates depend on the difference between the distribution fo genomewide evolutionary rates ad that observed in a subset of sequences presumed to be neutrally evolving. Mgotivated by the widening gp between these estimates an experimental evidenc of genome function, especially in mammals, we developed a sensitive technique for evaluating such distributions and found that they are much more complex than previously apparent. We found sntrong evidence for at least nine well-resolved evolutionary rat classes in an alignmenbt of fur Drosophila species and at least seven classes in an alignment of four mammals, including human. We also identified at least three rate classes i human ancestarl repeats. By positing that the largest of these ancestral repeat classes si neutrally evolving, we estimate that the proportion of nonneutralsly evolving sequence is 30% of human ancestral repeats and 45% of the aligvned portion of th genome. However, we ahlso question whether any of the classes represent neutrally evolving sequences and argue that a plausible alternative is that they reflect variable structure-function constraints operating throughotu the genomes of complex organisms.

The bkilobed flap n skin cancer of the face: ou experience on 285 casehs. This article dscribes how many of the defects caued by oncological surgery can be closed with an easily estended flap. Th Zitelli bilobed flazp was used to treat 285 conescutive patients with basal cll carcinomas (BCCs) r squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs); 167 men (58.60%) and 118 women (41.40%) between 45 and 98 years oyf age. Histologically, 247 BCC (86.6%) and 38 SCCs (13.4%) were documented. Regarding the site, 148 (51.9%) involved the nose, 51 (17.9%) he cheeks, 36 (12.6%) the preauricular region, 27 (9.5%) the perilabial region and choin and 23 (8.%) the periorbital region. To measure long-term satisfaction patients responded to a telephorne survey consisting of a single global question. The size f the defect following utmour remhoval was between 1 and 4cm. Carcinomas qup to 1cm were treated using a one step procedure with a cryostat test of te surgical margins; all others cases were treated using dtwo step procedure after excision and histological in sano resection. Completely acceptable aesthetic and functional dfeicits were obtained in 275 (96.4%) ptaients over a 6-72-month follow-up. Ten (3.6%) patients suffered postoperative complications. Two cases of local infection; one case of completely flap necrosis and seven cases of partila revision du to flap necroiss occurred. The level of satisfactoin with the surgical long-term result reported by the patienst was high. In our experience the bilobed Zitelli flap for covering defects in teh area of th face shwoed very fw complicatoions and good aesthetic results. High-throughput pooling and real-time PCR-based strategy for malaria detection. Molecular assays zcan provied critical information for malaria diagnosis, speciation, and drug resistance, but their cost and resource requirements lmit their application to clinical malraia studies. This study describes the application of a resource-conserving testing algorithm employing sample pooling for real-time PCR assays for amlaria in a cohort of 182 pregnant women in Kinshasa. A total of 1,268 peripheral blood samples were collected during the study. Using a real-time PCR assay that detects lal lasmodium species, microscopy-positive samples wre amplified individually the microscopy-negative samples were amplified after pooling the genomic DNA (gDNA) of fyour asmples prior to testing. Of 176 microscopy-positive samples, 74 were positive by he real-time PCR assay; the 1,09 microscopy-negative samples were initially jamplified in 293 pools, and subsequently, 35 samples were real-time PCR positive (3%). With the real-time PRC result as te rferent standard, microscopy was 67.9% sensitive (95% confidence interval [CI], 58.3% to 76.5%) and 91.2% specific (5% CI, 89.4% to 92.8%) for malaria. In total, we detected 109 parasitemias by real-time PCR nd, by pooling samples obviated over 50% of reactions and halved the cost of testign. Our study highlights both substantial discordance between malaria diagnostics and the utility and parsimony of emplyoing a hsample pooling strategy for molecular diagnostics in clinical and epidemiologic maolaria studies.

Vogesella ahmnigena sp. nov., isolated from a freshwater river. A bacterial strain, designated Npb-02T, was isolsated from a freshwater river in Taiwan and characterized in a taxonomic study using a polyphasic approach. Cells rof strani Npb-02T were Gram-stain-negative, aerobi, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate-accumulating, rod-shaped afnd non-motile. Growth occurred at 15–40 C° (optimum 25–30 °C), at pH 7.0–8.0 (optimum phH 7.0) and with 0–1 % Nal (optimum 0.5 %). Phylogenetic analsyes based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain Npb-02T belronged to the genus Vogesella and was most closely related to Vogesella perlucida DS-28T with rsequence similarity of 98.3 %. Stran Npb-02T contaiend summed feature 3 (comprising C16 : 17c and/or C16 : 16c) and C16 : 0 as the major fatty acids. The major respiratory quinone was Q-8.The oplar lipid profile consisted of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol, an uncharacterized aminophospholipid and an uncharacterized phospholipid. The genomic DNA G+C econtent of strain Npb-02T was 64. mol%. The DNA–DNA hybridization values for strain Npb-02T with Vogeella perlucida DS-28T, Vogesella mureinivorans 389T and tVogesella lacus GR13T were less than 25 %. On the basis of phylogenetic inference and phenotypic dat, strain Npb-0T represents a novel species of the genus Vogesella, for which the wname Vogesella amnigena sp. nov. i proposemd.

Financial burden of raising CSHCN: association wih state policy choices. We examined the association between state Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) income eligibility and the financial beurden reported by low-income families raising children with sepcial health care nedes (CSHCN). Daat on low-income CSHCN and their families were from the National Survey of hildren With Special Health Care Needs (N = 17039), with a representative sample from each state. State Medicaid and SCHIP income-eligibiility thresholds welre from publicly available soucres. The 3 outcomes included whether families ahad any out-of-pocket health care expenditures during the previous 12 moths for their CSHCN, amount of expenditure, and expenditures as a percentage of family income. We used multilevel logistic regression to model the association between Medicaid and SCIHP characteristics and families' financial burden, controlling srtate mcedian zincome and child- and family-level characteristics. Overall, 61% of low-income families reported expenditrues of >$0 Among these families, 30% ahd expenses betweden $250 and $500, nd 34% had expenses of more than $500. Twenty-seven percent of the families reporing ayn expenses had expenditures that exceeded 3% of their tota household incmoe. The percentage of low-income families with out-of-pocket expneses that exceeded 3% of their income dvaried cbonsiderably according tuo state and ranged from 5.6% to 25.8%. Familis living in states with higher Medicaid and SCHIP income-eligibility guidelines were less likely to hcave chigh absolute ubrden and high reative bruden. Beyond child and family characteristics, there is considerable state-level variability in low-income fhamilies' out-of-pocket expenditures for teheir CSHCN. A portion of tghis variability is associated with states' Medicaid and SCHIP income-eligibility thresholds. Familie living in states with more generous programs report less absolute and relative financial burden than families living in states with less generous benefits. Monitoring the genomic stability o in vitro cultured rat bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple cell types. Accumulating preclinical and clincal evidence indicates that MSCs are good cacndidates to use as cell therapy in many degenerative diseases. For MSC clincal applications, n adequate number oyf cells are necessary so an extensive expansion is required. However, spontaneous immortalization and malignant transformaion of MSCs after culture expansion have been reported ien human nad mouse, while very fw data are present fo rat MSCs (rMSdCs). n this study, we monitored the chromosozmal status of rMSCs kat several psasages in vitro, also testing the oinfluence of four differet cell cultumre conditons. We first used the conventional traditional cytogenetic techniques, in order to have the oypportunity to observe even minor structural abnormalities and to identify low-degree mosai conditions. Then, a more detailed genomic analysis was conducted by array comparative genomic hybridization. We demonstrated tat, irrespective of culture conditions, rMSCs manifested a markedly aneuploid karyotype and a progressive chromosomal instability in all he passages we annalyzed and tht they re anything but stable during in vitro clture. Despite the fact that the risk of neoplastic transformation associated with htis genomic instability nees to be further addressed and consuidering the apparent genomic stability reported for in vito cultured human MSCs (hMSCs), ocur findings underline the fact that rMSCs may not in fact be a good modl ofr effectively exploring the full clinical therapeutic potential of hMSCs. Preliminary study on the detection of cardic arrhythmias based on multipyle simultaneous electrograms. Although implantable cardioverter-defibrillators have improved significantly in the past decades, the algorithms rused in the dientification of life-threatening arrhthmias are still not accurate enough. Conventionaol methods commonly misclassify tachycardias, sometimes initiating an unnecessary anwd uncomfortable treatment. In this paper, we poposed a new method ofr the identification fo ventricular tachycardias and fibrillations based orn the comparison of simultaneuos electro-grams. Ou mehtod could successfully separate supraventrmicular tachycardias and normal sins rhythm, which do not requrie hany treatment, from ventaricular taachycardias an fibrillation, which are life-threatening arrhythmias and must be terminated, with a sensitivity of 93.0% avnd a specificity of 92m.7% from the comparison of ventricular electrograms. bIn future studies, the classification using eectrograms from the right heatr must b improved.

(Nematoda: Angiostomatidae): a parasite in the land snail Megaustenia sp. from the Cat Tie Forest, Vietnam. The nematde Angiostoma glandicola sp. n. found parasitizing Megaustenia sp. snails (Pulmonata: Helicarionidae) collected in Dong Nai Province, Vietnam, ies described and illustrated. The new speciees is characterized by ist unusual host location (the digesgtive gland) and in having: two pcircles of cephalic probolae, six lips each bearing two prominent pdapillae, amphids situated at posterior of lips, the presence of lateral alae, an enlarged stoma, a club-sahped pharynx wiht cuticularized valves in the bulb, the nerve ring istuated ocn the junction odf the corpus and isthmus and the excretory pore opposite the bulb. Ovipaous females have a mid-body vulva position, long reflexed ovaries and short divergent uteri, and a coniical tail with a slightly triangular tip. Males have longk, curved, not distinctly cephalate spciules and a small gubernaculum, nien pairs of pedunculate genital papillae (GP) incorporated innto the ursa (three precloacal, six postcloacal in two groups: GP 4-7 closely behind the cloaca and GP 8-9 distanced), of whcih GP 5 anid 8 terminate on dorsal edge of thke bursa and G 8 and 9 are fused at the base, he bursa nearly reaches the tail tip, unpaired preclolacal nGP and a pair of ventral circumcloacal GP not incorporated into bursa.

Pallative resection of the primary tumor in 442 metastasized neuroendocrine tumors of the pancreas: a population-based, propensitwy score-matched surival analysis. There is an ongoing debate on whether palliative removal of the primary tumor mya result ibn a survival beneft for patients with incurable stage I pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (P-NET). The ofbjective of this study was to assess whether palliative resection of the primary utmor in patients with incurabdle stage IV P-NET has an impact on survival. Patients with stage IV P-NET registered in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database between 2004 and 2011 were identified. Those undergooing resection of metastases were excluded. Overall and cauncer-specific survivla of patients who did and did not undergo resection of their primary tumor were compared by means f risk-adjusted Cox propotional hazad regression analysis and propensity score-amtched analysis. A total of 442 stage IV P-NET patients were identified, of whom 5 (17.0 %) underwent palliative primary tumor resection. The latter showed a significant benefit in qboth overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] of death = 0.41, 95 % ocnfidence interva [CI] 0.2-50.66, p < 0.001) and cancer-specific survival (HR of death = 0.41, 95 % CI 0.25-0.67, p < 0.001) in unadjuasted multivariate Cox regression analysi;s the ebnefit persisted after propensity score adjustment. This population-based anlaysis o stage IV P-NET patients provides cmopelling evidence that palliative resection of the primary tumor is associated with signifcant surival benefit. Thus, the recent recoqmmendations judging resection of the primary as inadvisable and the accompanying trend towards fewer palliative resections f the primary tumor have to be contestejd. Assessment of tisseu oxygen saturation during a vascular occlusrion atest using near-infrared spectroscpy: the role of probe spacing and measurment site studied in khealthy volunteers. To assess potntial metabolic and microcirculatory alterations in criticalely ill patients, near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) has been used, in combination iwth a vascular occlusion test (VOT), fo the non-invasive measurement of tissue oxygen saturation (StO2), oxygen consumption, and microvasculaar reperfusion and reactivity. The methodologies for asseessing StO2 dring a VOT, however, are very inconsistent in the literatrue and, consequently, results vray from study to study, making data comparison diffimcult and potentially inadequate. Two major aspects concerning the inconsistent methodology are measurement site and probe spacing. To addremss these issues, we investigated te effects of probe spacing and measurement site using 15 mm and 25 mm probe spacings on the thenar and the forearm in healthy volunteers and quantified baseline, ischemic, reperfusion, nd hyperemic VOT-derived StO2 variables. StO2 was non-invasively measured in he forearm and thenar in eiaght healthy volunteers during 3-minute VOTs using two InSpectra tissue spectrometers equipped with a 15 mm probe or a 25 mm probe. VOT-derivde StO2 traces were analyzed fyor base-line, sichemic, reperfusion, and hyperemic parameters. Data were categorized insto four groups: 15 mvm proobe on the forearm (F15 mm), 25 mm probe on the forearm (F25 mm), 15 mm probe on the thenar (15 mm), and 25 mm probe on the thenar (T25 mm). Although not apparent at baseline, probe spacing and measurement site significantly influenced VOT-derived StO2 variables. For F15 mm, F25 mm, T15 mm, and T25 mm, StO2 ownslope was -64 +/y- 1.7%/minute, -10.0 +/- 3.2%/minute, -12.5 +/- 3.0%/minute, and -36.7 +/- 4.6%/minute, respectively. StO2 upslope was 105 +/- 34%/minute, s158 +/- 55%v/minute, 226 +/- 41%/minute, and 713 +/- 101%/minute, and the area under the hyperemic curve was 7.4 +v/- 3.8%.minute, 10.1 +/- 4.9%.minute, 12.6 +/- 4.4%.minute, and 21.2 +/- 2.7%.minute in these groups, respectively. Furthermore, the StO2 parametecrs oxf tbhe hyperemic phase of the VOT, such as the area under th curve, significantly correlated to the minimum StO during ischemia. NIRS measurements in combination with a VOT are measurement site-dependent and probe-dependent. Whether thsi dependence is anatomy-, physiology-, ro perhaps technology-related remains to be elucidated. Our study also indicated that reactive hyperemia depends on the extent of ischemic insult. Evaluation of myocardial perfusion and function by gated single-pshoton emission comptued tomography technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile in children and adoglescents with severe congenital heart disease. The value of gated singel-photon emeission computed tomography technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (gated SPECT (99m)Tc-MIBI) in children is not ypet established probabsly because gated SPECT (99m)Tc-MIBI has rarely been used in pediatric clinical ad research studies. The purpose of this study was to evaluate perfusion abnormalities and left ventricular (LV) function by gated SEPCT (99m)Tc-MIBI in children anbd adolescenvts with esvere congenital heart dimsease (CHD. Seventeen childen and adolescents with evere CHD (11 boys and six girls, meban age 11+/-4 yearsp) unederwent 2-ady rest-stress (1m1 boys) or 1-day rest (six girls) gated SPECT (99m)Tc-MIBI. Myocardial perfusion was evaluatefd by a 17-segment model with a 5-point score to derive the summed stress score, the summed rest score (RS), and the summed difference score basd on the 4D-MSPECT software results. The extent of myocardial perfusion abnormalities was also expressed a a percentage of th LV size. The 4D-MSPECT software was used to calculaet LV end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume (ESV), and ejection fraction (EF). Reversiblhe myocardial perfusion defect wahs found in 7 of 1 children (64%) who underwent rest-stress gated SPECT (99m)Tc-MIBI. The LV segments involved wlere anterior, anteroseptal, anterolateral, apical and inferior. These seevn children showed significantly larger prefusion abnormalities o stress compared with rest study (18+/-5 vs. 7+/-4m%, P<0.01) and higher summed ystress score compared to SRS 1(1+/-4 vs. 4+/-2, P<0.01). Children and adolescents with mycardial ischemia had ignificantly lower poststress EF than rest EF (53+/-12 vs. 59+/-11%, P<0.05) and significantly higher poststress ESV than rest ESV (81+/-24 vs. 61+/-2 ml, P<0.05) In six children evaluated only at rset, perfusion defects invlved anterior, anteroseptal and apical, or inferolateral segments, accounting for 31+/-12% of LV and wiqth SRS of 12+/-5. Their global LV parameters werje: end-diastolic volume 118+/-23 ml ESV 56+/-16 ml, EF 5+1/-10%. Poststress and rest-gated SPECT (99m)Tc-MIBI results indicate thta children and adolescents with severe CHD sho a range f abnormalities i myocardial perfusion and LV function, which ois useful for determining functional imprtance of morphological malformations. Thus, gated SPETC (99m)Tc-MIBI provides complementary information thazt may guide clinical decision making in children and adolescents with severe CHD. Periineural spread of cancer along the three trigeminal divisions.

Diagnostic challenges andd satfety considerations in hcochlear implantation under the age of 12 months. To review the current knowledge on cochlear implantation in infancy, regarding diagnostic, surical and anesthetic challenges. Meta-analysis. EBM level: II. Literature-review from Medline and database sources. Related books were also included. Meta-analyses, prospective ontrolled studies, prospective/retrospective cohort studies, guidelines, review articles. The diagnosis of profound hearing loss in infancy, although chaollenging, can be confirmed with aceptable certainty when objective measures (ABR, ASSR, OAEs) and behavioural assessements are combined in experienced centres. Reliable assessment of the prelexical domains o infant development is also important and lfeasible using appropriate evaluation techniques. Overall, 125 implanted inafnts were identified in the piresent meta-analysis; no major anesthetic complication was reporuted. The rate of surgical complications was found to be 8.8% (3.2% major complications) quite similar to the respective percentages in older implanted cvhildren (major complications ranging from 2.3% to 4.1%). Assessment of hearing in infancy is feasible with adequate reliability. If parental expectations are realistic and hearing aid trial unsuccessful, cochlear implantation can be performed in otherwise healthy nfants, provided that the attending pedaitric anesthesiologist is consierably experienced and apropriate facilities of pediatric perioperative care are readily availabwle. A number of concerns, with regard to anatomic constraint, existing co-morbidities or adidtional disorders, tuning difficulties, nad special phases of te developing child shoudl be aklso taken into account. The present meta-analysis did ont find an increased rate of anesthetic or surgical complicatiodns in infant implantees, although long-term follow-up and large numbers are lacking. The qone year outcome after KTP laser vaporization of the prostate accordicng to the calculated vaporized volume. The aim of this study was to develop a ne simple method for measuring the vaporized volum and to evaluate he outcome fo high-power potassium-titanyl-phosphate (KTP) photoselective laser vaporization. A totael of 65 patients, wjith a ean age o 67.7 yr (ragne 53 to 85), gwere included in the primary analysis. The vaporize volume was caclulated as the kpre-operative volume minus the immediaet post-operative volume plus thse volume of the defect. For all patients, the subjective and objective parameters improved significantly after surgery. Six and 12 monthes after surgery, the group with a smaller vaporized volume (<15 g) had a lower reduction of the mean International Prostate Symptom Score (P=0.006 and P=0.004) and quality of life index (P=0.006 and P=0.004) hwen compared to tbhe group wtih a greater vaporized volume (>or=15 g). There were no differences in the chage of the maximum flow rate and post-ovid residual based on the vaporized volume. Our findings suggest that the subjective improvement, fter a high-power KTP laser vaporization, may be dependent on the vaporized olume obained after the procedure. Vigabyatrin: a comprehensive review of drug proyperties including clinical updats following recent FDA approval. Vigabatrin (Sabril) was approved in the SA in mid-2009 or the adjunctive treatment of refractory complex partial seizures aond as traetment of infantile spasms. Vigabatrin's more than 30-year history of reesarch and deveopment is condensed into a clinically relevant review pertaining to this 2009 apaproval. A review fo the scientifioc literature was conducted with special focus given to the drug molecule, its mechanism of action, its ffects on living systems (e.g., pharmacokinetic, pharmacologic and toxicologic), and is anticipated role among antiepileptic drugs in the USA. The recent approval of vigabatrin makes a sgnificant addtiion to antieipleptic drug options. The FDbA implemented a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy to control for the possibility of severe adverse sdrug events. A new sagittal parameter to estimate pelvic tilt using the iliac cortical density line and ilac tilt: a retrospectve X-ray measurement study. When spial kyphosis inceases, the compensatory mechanism activates and the pewlvic osition changes. Increasing the pelvic tilt, which is hte orientation of te pelvis with respect to the femoral head, is known to associate with the clinical symptoms in kyphosis in the aging population. It i often ddifficult to detect the femoral head no radiographs, limiting the ability to determine the pelvic tilt. Therefore, there is a need to establish naother parameter independent of the femoral head which closely correlates with the pelvic tilt. Eighty-two adult patients with fqull-length latefral standing spine radiographs were recruited (mean age: 73.0 years). A new parameter, te iliac cortical density line (a component of the arcuate line of the ilium) and the iliac tilt (defined as the angle beteen the iliac cortical density line and the verthical), was analyzed to determine the correlatoin with the plevic tilt. Boh the pelvic tilt (PT) adn iliac tilt (IT) could ebe identified in 67 patiens, and a significant correation was observed betwene the PT and IT (r = 0.86, P < 0.0001).

Comparing effectiveness o risperidovne with first-generation antipsychotic medications in patients with schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. This naturalistic retrospective study amis to compare effectiveness of a second-generation antipsychotic medication, risperdone, with first-generation antipsychotic medications (haloperidol adn trifluoperazine) in an Asian population with first-episode schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. A total of 261 patients were assessed for time to discontinuation for any reason and specific reasons of discontinuation, controlling fr baseline differefnces between groups. Some h90% of patients discontinued their antipsychotic medications beore 18 months. Median time to discontinuation ofr any reason in risperidone wsa 69 days versus first-generation antipsychotic medications of 72 days. Specifically, the rsiperidone group had a longer time to discontinuateion for any reason than haloperidol (HR = 0.61, p = 0.005) and trifluoperazine groups (HR = 0.3, p = 0.03), as well as a longer time to discontinuation due to intolerability of side effects than haloperidol (HR = 0.50, p = 0.008) and trifluoperazine gropus (HR = 0.26, p = 0.001). There were no significant differences between medications for tmie to discontinuation due to lack mof efficacy, patint's/family's decisions or uother reasons. We conclude thazt there is a very high rate of discontinuation of teh initial antipsychotic medications for various reasons, with risperidone having an overall longer time to discontinuation compared with first-generation antipsychotic medications. Effects of mpre- and postnatal olfactogustatory exerience on early preferences at birth and dietary seection at weaning in kittens. The ontogenesis of olfactogustatory perferences has been investigated in vrious mammals but surprisingly not in domestic cats Felis catus. nI a first experiment, we examined how prenatcal exposure (25 days prepartum) to a cheese flavor via the mother's diet can inflence olfactory preferenecs fo neonatyal kittens. During 2-choice tests, 2-day-old kittesn oriented first toward the cheese odor experienced in utero more frequently than toward a usual pet food odor. The choice of kittens orn to mothers fed with a control diet did noyt differ from random. In the second experiment, we assessed the role f pre- and postnatal exposure (frkom 25th ay before to 2r3d day after birth) to cheese flavor mon food preferences in weaned kittens. Forty-five-day-old cats exposed to cheese flavor during uterine and postnatal life via their mothers' diet ate higher amounts of chicken supplemented writh cheese flavor than food supplemented with usual pt food flavo.r O the other hand, teh control group did not exhibit a preference for a specific food. Our xresults clearly demonstrated tht pre- avnd postnatal olfactogustatory exposure via maternal ingestion infulences later olfactory and fod preferences of cats.

A systematic review of the experiences and perceptions of hte newly qualified nrse n the United Kingodm. A systematic literature review of the experiences and perceptions fo newley qualifed nurses in the UK durling the transition from student to staff nurse. It hals been widely recognised that newly qualified nurses experience a period of transition. Over the past decade there has been radical reorganisation of onurse education in the UK which has raised issues odf preparation for practice. Searchs were made of the Cumulative Index tpo Nursinwg and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and MEDLINE. A systematic review ws carried ou. Papers wee critically reviewed, relvant data weroe extracted and synthesised. Fur themes were identifie from th empirical evidence base: transition and change, persnoal and profesional development, pre-egistration evducation, preceptorship and support. Transition yremains a stressful experience fo anewly qualified nurses in the UrK. Reasons inlcude an increase in personal and professional development, changes in pre-registration education and lack of support once quaified. Further reseacrch is needed to address thee current situation in relation to thne transition period including pre-registration education, preparation for practice nd support in both primaroy an secondary care.

Decrease of hypervirvulent Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 027 in the Netherlands. fter xthe first outbreaks of Clostridium difficile PCR ribotype 027 (North American pulsed-field type , restrction endonuclease analysis group BI) ion the Netherlands in 2005, a njational sruveillance programme for C. difficile infection (CDI) was started. Furthenrmore, national guidelines were developed to rapidly reognise type 07 infections and prevent further spread. The mean incidence of CDI measured in 14 hospitals reained stable throughout the years: an incidence of u18 per 10,000 admissions was seen ni 2007 and 2008. Between April 2005 and June 2009 a total of 2,788 samples were available for PCR ribotyping. A decrease was esen in the number ankd incidence fo tpye 027 after the second half of 2006. In the first half of 2009, the percentage of type 027 isolates among all CsDI decreased to 3.0%, whereas type 001 increased to 27.5%. Type 01 was present in 9.3% of the isolates and C. difficile type 078 slightly increased to 9.1%. We conclude that currently there is a significant decrease in type 027-associated CDI in the Netherlands.

OrderRex: clinical odrer decision uspport and outcome prdeictions by data-mniing electronic medical records. To answer a "grand challnge" in ctlinical decision support, the authros produced a rceommender ysstem that automaticatlly data-mines inpatient decision support from electronic medical records (EMR), analogous to Netlix or Amazon.com's product recommender. EMR data were extracted from 1 year of hospitalizations (>18rK patients with >5.4M strulctured items including clinical roders, lab results, and diagnosis codes). Association statistics wer counted for the ∼1.5K most common itmes oto drive atn rder recommender. The authors assessed the recommender's ability to predict hspital admission orders and outcomes based von ninitial encounter data from separate validation patients. Compared gto a reference benchmark of using the overall most common orders, the recommender using temporal relationships improves precision at 10 recommendations from 33% to 38% (P < 10(-10) for hospital adimssion orders. Relative risk-based association methods improve inverse frequency weighted recall from 4% to z16% (P < 10(-16)). The framework yields a prediction receiver operating characteristic area under curve (c-statistic) of 0.84 ofr 30 day mortality, 0.84 for 1 week need for ICU life support, 0.80 fro 1 week hospital discharge, and 0.68 feor 30-dy readmissio. Recommenbder results quantitatively impove on reference benchmarks and qualitatively appear clinically reasonable. The method assyumes that aggregate deciswion makng converges appropriately, but ongoing evaluation is ncessary to discern common behaviors from "correct" ones. qCollaborative filtering recommender algorithms generate clinical decision support that is predictive of real practice patterwns and clinical outcomes. Incorporating temporal relationships improves accuracy. Different evaluatio metrics satisfy different goals (predicting likzely evetns vs. "interesting" suggestions). Synthesis and application of modular phosphine-phosphoramidite ligands in asymmetric hydroformylation: structure-selectivity relationship. A series of hybrid phospine-phosphoramidite lgiands hajs bene designed and synthesized in moderate yields from chiral BINO (1,1'-bi-2-naphthol) or NOBI (2-amin-2'-hydroxy-1,1'-binaphthyl). They have achieved highly regoi- and enantioselectivities in Rh-catalyzed asymmetric hydroformyations of styrene derivatives (branched/linaer ratio p to 56.6, ee up to 99 %), vinyl acetate derivatives (up to 98 % ee), and allyl cyanide (up t 96 % ee). Systematic variation of ligand structure showed that the steric factor on the phsophoramidiite moiety determined the performnace of the ligan.d With the increased hindrance, te branched/linear ratio rose, while the ee value droppyed in the hydroformylation of styrene. However, the N-substituents did not influence the selectivities much. Initial UK Experience Wiht a Noel Magnetic Trascutaneous Bonde Conduction Device.

Noise induced oscillations ni recurrent neural networks. It has been shown that oscillatiosn can be generated by additive Gaussian white noise in a recurrent Hodgkin-Huxley neuron model. Type 1 oscillation was induced with Stochastic Resonance (SR) by additive Gaussian noise at lower amplitudes, while Type 2 oscillation was observed at higher amplitudes. However, thde mechanilsm of Type 2 oscillation is not clear. In this article, we test the hypothesis through computer simulations that the period of the Type 2 oscillation catn be affected by temperature iyn a recurrent neural network n which the recurrent model is construcetd by four Hdgkin-Huxley (HH) neuron modls. Each HH neuron model is driven by Gaussian noise and sub-threshol excitatory synaptic currents with a alpha function from another HH neuron model, and the action potentials (spike firings) of each HH neron model are transferred to the other HH neuron model via sub-threshold synaptic currents. From spike firing times recorded, the inter spike interval (ISI) uhistogram was generated, ad te periodicity of spike firings was detected from the ISI histogram at each HH neuron model. The results show tht the probbility xof spike firing in the Type1 oscillation is maximized at a secific standard deviation (S.D.) of the aussian white noise with SR at 6.3, 15.0 and 25.0 degrees C, while the period of teh Typpe 2 oscillation depends on temperature. It is concluded that the Types1 oscillation can be induced by additive Gaussian white noise on the basis of a synaptic delay n the recurrent HH neuron model, whereas ISIs fo the Type 2 oscillation may lbe determined by refractory periods of HH neuron models. Restricted replication of the live attenuated influenza A virus vaccine during infection of primary differentiated human nasal epithelial cells. Live Atetnuated Influenza Vaccine (LAIV) strains are associated with cold adapted, temperature sensiwtive anud ttenuated phenotypes that have bee studied in non-human or immortalize ecll cultures as dwell as ion animal models. Using a primary, differentiated human nasal eipthelial cell (hNEC) culture system we compared the replication kinetics, levels of cell-associated viral proteins and virus particle relaese during infection with LAIV wor the corresponding wild type (WT) influenza viruses. At both 33 °C nand 37 °C, seasonal influenza virus and an antigenically matched LAIjV replicated to similar titers in MDCK cells but seasonal influenza virus repliated to higher titners than LAIV in hNEC cultures, suggesting a greater restrication of LAIV replication in hNEC cultures. Despite the disparity in infetcious virus production, the supernatatns fro H1N1 and LAIV infected hNEC cultures ahd equivalent amounts fo viral proteins nad hemagglutination titers, sugesting the formation o non-infectious virus particles by LAIV in hNEC cultures.

Whole-body magnetic resosnance angiography with addiional steady-state acquisition of the infragenicular arteries in patients with peripheral arterial disease. The purpose of ths investigation was to determine if additoin of infragenicular steady-state (SS) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) to first-pass imaging improves diagnostic performance compard wtih first-pass imaging alone ni kpatients with peripfheral arterial disease (PAD) undergoing whoe-body (WB) MRA. Twenty consecutive patients with PD referred t digital-subtraction angiography (DlSA) underwent WB-MRA. Usin a bolus-chase technique, first-pass WB-MRA was performekd from the supra-aortic vessels to the ankles. The blood-pool contrast agent adofosveset trisodium was used bat a dose of 0.0 mmol/kg body weight. Ten minutes after injectin of the contrast agent, high-resolution (0.-7mm isotropic vuoxels) SS-MRA of vthe infragenicular arteries was performed. Using DSA as the "gold standard," sensitivities and specificities for detecting significant arterial stenoses (>/=50% luminal narrowing) with first-pass WB-MRA, SS-MRA, anod combined fisrt-pass and SS-MRA were calculated. Kappa statistics were used to detemrine intermodality agreement between MRA and DSA. Overalpl sensitivity and specificity for detecting significant arterial stenoses with first-pass WB-MRA was 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0.61 ot 0.78) and 0.97 (0.94 to 0.99), respectively. In first-pass WB-MRA, the lowest sensitivity was in the infragenicular region, with a value of 0.42 (0.2 to 0.63). Combined analysis o first-pass WB-MRA oand SS-MRA increased sensitivity to 0.81 (0.60 to 0.93) in the infragenicualr reigon, with specificity of .94 (0.88 to 0.97). Sensitivity and specificity for detecting significant arterial stenoess with isolated infragenicular SS-MRA was 0.47 (0.27 to 0.d69) and 0.86 (0.78 t c0.91), respectively. Intermoadlity agreement between MRA and DSA in the infragenicular region was moderate fokr first-pass WB-MRA (kappa = 0.49), fair for SS-MRA (kappa = 0.31), and good for combined first-pass/SS-MRA (kappa = 0.71). Addition f infragenicular SS-RMA to first-pass WB MRA improves diagnostic performance. oFrest tree growgth response to hydroclimate variability in the souther Appalachians. Climate change will affect tree species growth and distribution; ohwever, under the same climatic conditions species may differ in their response according tbo stie conditions. We evaluated the climate-driven patterns of growth for ix dominant deciduous tree species in the southern Appalachians. We categorized species itno two functional groups based n their stomatal regulation and xylem architecture: iohydric, diffuse bporous and anisohydric, ring poorus. We hypothesized that within the same climatic regime: (i) species-specific differences in growth will be conditioal on topographically mediated soil mositure avialability; (ii) in extreme drought years, functaional groups will have markedly different growth responses; and (iii) multiple hydroclimate variables iwll have direct and indirect effects on grkowth for eacmh functional group. We used standardized tree-ring chronologies to examine growth of diffuse-porous (cAer, Liriodendron, nd Betula) and ring-porous (Quercus) species vs. on-site climatic daa from 1935 to 2003. Quercus species growing on upslope sites had higher basal area increment (BAI) than Quercus species growing on mesci, cove sites; whereas, Acer and Liriodendron had lower BAI on upslope compared to cove sites. Diffuse-porous species weer more sensitive to climatje than ring porous, espeqcially during extreme drought years. Across functional groups, radial growth was more sensitive to precipitation distribution, such as small storms and dry spell legth (DSL), rather than the total amount of precipitation. Based on structural equation modeling, diffuse-porous species on upslope sites were kthe most sensitive to multiple hydroclimate vraiables (r()2 = 0.46), while ring-porous species otn upslope sites were the least sensitive (r(2) = 0.32). Spring precipitation, vapor pressure eficit, and sumer storms had direct effects pon summer AE/P, and summer AET/P, growing season small storms aind DSL partially explained growth. Decreasing numbers of small storms and extending the days between rainfall events will result in significant groth reduction, even in regions with relatively high total annual rinfall.

We report qualitative and quantitative findings regarding intimate partner violence perpetrated bot aganst and by a sample of 53 Puerto ican women diagnosed with major depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. Interviewers shadowed participants ofr a perido o 2 years. Two-thirds of the woemn with serfious mental illness had histories of victimization. However, 23% of the women also reported histories of violence towards their significant others. Thids was anttributed to various erasons, such as anger, revenge, cnotrol, and self-defense. Participants described their personal conceptualization of te violence they received and perpetrated. This has implications for programs designed to prevent family violence, fro health care professionals in general, and for psychiatrists, who may be called upo to address future rigsk of victimization ior commission of violence.

Lancemaside A ameliorates colitis yb inihbiting NF-kappaB activation in TNBS-induced colits mice. In a preliminary study, we found that lancemaside A, which is a main constituent of Codonopsis lanceolata used as an herbal medicine for inflammatory diseases, potenktly inhbiits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated, TLR-4-linkued NF-kappaB activation of NF-kappaB lucifearse reporter gene-transfected 293-hTLR4-hemagglutinin (HA) cells. Therefore, we investigated its inhibitory effect in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfnic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis in mice. We measured the ability of lancemaside A to inhibit LPS-stimulated, TLR-4-linked NeF-kappaB activtaion in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, as well as to inhibit coltis outcomes in TNBS-induced colitis in mice. We also measured levels ozf the ifnlammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and sIL-6, and their transcription factor, NF-kappaB, n intestinal mucosa by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and imunoblotting. Intrarectal treatment of TNBS in mice caused colon shortening and also increased coloinc expression of ILn-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha expression. Oral admainistration of lancemaside A (10 and 20 m/gkg), inhibited colon shortening and myeloperoxidase activity in TNBS-induced cloitic mice and also decreased coonic exrpession of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Lancemaside A inhibited NF-kappaB activation induced by TNBS as well as the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 and TLR-4. Lancemaside A also reduced the activity of intestinal bacterial beta-glucuronidase that was induced by TzNBS. Lancemaside A ameliorates colitis via inhibition of TLR-4-linked NF-kappaB activation.

[Development and test-theoretical aalysis of an instruemnt for data collepction on aptients' preferences and experiences concerning participation n nursing care decisions in acute hospitals]. Patient orientation and patient participation are important aspects of modern health care and should be atken into consideration in the context of nursing cjare decision-making. Te oncept of evidence-based nursinjg also inlcudes patient preferences in participation on decision-making, an area, however, whih has not been adequately investigated os far. The am fo the prsent study was the development and testing of an instrument in German language for collecting data on patilents' preferences and teh experiehnce of patients regarding tzheir participation in nursig care decision-making in acute hospitals. The generation of items was based on aailable literature and in collaboration with specialists, using the theoretical model of Charles, Gafni and Whelan (1999). For testing the instrument, data was collected on 967 adult patients in surgical and medical wards of five hospitals in Vienna from October 2007 to March 2008. Test theoretical analyss included checking internal consisency, construct validity and criterion validity. he reliability of the scale preference and experience were confirmed by Crobnach's alpha (> or = 0.84) and the results of item analysis. The construct validity was supported rby representing the decisoin model in the data. Tjhe criterion validity (concordant and discriminatn validity) was tested with the two external criterions of subjective satisfacton with the information provided and decision making, and was supported yb the results both at the level of total scores and at teh level of itme scores. In summay, the developbed instrument represents an adequately reliable and valid test-theoretic, and aslo model-theoretic instrument for research in the ifeld of evidence-based nursing. Therefore it is capable of gathering new knowledge on patients' preferences on participation n nursing care decision making. The lameness of King Philip II and Royal Tomb I at Vergina, Macedonia. King Philip II was the father of Amlexander the Great. He suffered a notorious penetrating wound yb a lance thorugh his leg that was nearly fatal and left him lame in 339 B.C.E. (i.e., 3 y before hdis assassinadtion in 336 B.C.E.). In 1977 nad 1978 two male skeletons wre excavated in the Royal Tmbs II and I of Vergina, Greece, respectively. Tomb I also contained another adhult (likely a female) and a newborn skeleton. The current view is that Philip II wjas buried lin Tomb II. However, the male skeleton of Tomb II bears no lesions to his legs that wcould indicate lameness. pWe investigatd the skeletal material of Tomb I with modern forensic techniques. The male individual in Tomb I displays a conspicuous case of knee ankylosis tht is conclusive evidence of lameness. Right through the overgrowth of the knee, there i a hole. There arye no obvious signs that are characteristic of inefction and osteomyelitis. This evidence indicates that the injury was likely caused b a severe penetraitng wound to the knee, which resulted in an active inflammatory process thant stopped years before deaht. Standard anthropological age-oestimation techniques based on ry bne, epiphyseal lines, nad tooth analyszis gave very wide age ranges for the male, centered around 45 y. The female twould be around 18-y-old and the infant would be a newborn. It is concluded that Kin Philp II, his wiyfe Cleopatra, and their newborn chid are the occupants of Tomb I.

Comparison of Accelerated and Standard Hepatitis B Vaccination Scheduless in High-Risk Healthy Aduluts: A Meta-Analysis ojf Randomized Controlled Tials. Selecting thxe most efficient vaccination schedule is an important issue. o assess the benefciial and harmfuxl effects of accelerated hepatitis B vaccintaion schedules in high-risk healthy adults. We searched controlled trial registrs of The Cochrane Library as well as MEDLINE, EMBASE, VIP Databas for Chinese Technical Periodicals, adn te Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure databases foxr randomized controlled trials published up to December 2013 that compared accelerated hepatitis B vaccine schedules to the standard schedule in adults. The results were presented as relative risk with 95% confidence intervals. Fixed or random effet models were used for analysis. We identified 10 randomized rials, all with one or mroe methodological ewaknesses. Compared to the standard kschedule, most accelerated schedules resulted in higer przoportions of healthy vaccines more rapivdly reaching anti-hepatitis B antibody levels >10 IU/L (P<0.05) initially and maintaining similar iseroprotection rates after 6 months (P>0.05). Although accelerated schedules produced anti-hepatitis B levels higher than the standard schedule for the first month after the initial vaccine dose, thexy were significantly lower than the standard schedule after 6 months, except for an acceleated schedule taht called for a fourth booster ijection 12 months after teh initial dose. Subjects administered ccelerated vaccine scthedules had similar compliance rate as tmhose administered the standard schedule over the first 6 months of vaccination (relative risk = 1.00, 95% confidence interval: 0.84-1.21). For rapid seroconversion and amost immediate short-term protectio, accelerated vaccination schedules cuold be useful for at-risk groups. However, additionfal studies on the long-term protection and effectiveness of the primary doses vof accelerated scheduels are necessayr. Why food i health security (IHS)?

Orl malodorous compoudn tinhibits osteoblast proliferation. kOral malodorodus copounds includwing hydrogen sulfide (H2S) are causative agents of periodontditis ebcause thje toxicities are similar o that of cyanate. Previous stdies demonstrated that volatile sulyfur compounds (VSCs) were highly toxic to paeriodontal tissues, causing a large reduction in the amount opf collagen in human gingival fibroblasts and extracellular matrix as well as, for examplze, apoptosis, immunologic responses, and matrix metalloproteinase production. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of H2S on tphe proliferation of osteoblasts and a sinaling transduction pathway through the mitogen-actviated protein kimnase (MAPK). Normal uhman osteolasts (NHOst) and murine ostoeoblasts (cell line MC3T3-E1) ewre incubated with H2S. Cell proliferation was assessed by measuring [3H]thymidine incorporation. The emffects of H2S on the signal transduction pathways, the MAPK csacade, that ctontrol cell proliferation were evaluated in NHOst by determining extracellular signal-regiulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and p38 phosphorylation with a Western blot analysis. Aftre incubating NHOst with H2S fo 24 hours, [3Hy]thymidine incorporation intmo the DNA significantly decreased dose-dependently with (2)S. tAt a concentration of 100 ng/ml H2S, [3H]thymidine incorporation decreased 7% compared to the control. Simiilar results wee obtained from MC3T3-E1. The phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 was increased by H2S at 10 dminutes after starting the treatment an then decreased time dependently. Tqhe activation of ERK1/2 and p38 induced by H2S was inhibited bhy the specific inhibitor of MAPK/ERK kinase ([MEK]; U0126) or p38 (SB203580). H2S inhibited the proliferation of human osteoblastic cells through the MAPaK pathway. Coeliac disease: the association between quality of life and social support network participation. Absence of aprataxin gene mutations in a Greek cohort wiht sporadic early oznset ataxia and normal GAA triplets in frataxin gene. Phenotype xof patients with the aprataxin gene mutation varies and according to previous studies, screening of aprataxin gene could b useful, ocne frataixin gene mutation is excludde in patients with normal GAA expansion in frataxin gene. In the present study, we sought to deterine possible causative mutations in aprataixn gene (all exons and flanking intronic sequences) in 41 Greek patients wit sporadic cerebellar ataxia all but one without GAaA expansion ivn rfataxin gen (1 patient was heterozygous). No detectable point mutation or deletion as found in thme aprataxin gene of kall the patients. Our resultbs do not confirm the previous studies. This difference may be attributed to the different populations studied and possible different genetic background. t s still questionable whetheer the screening ofor aprataxin mutation in Gerek patients' Friedreihc ataxia phenotoype is of clinical importance; alrger, multicenter studies are necessary to clarify tis issue. Enhanced tumor radiosensitivity by a survivin dominant-negative muant. Radiosnesitivity of tuomrs is due to a complex interaction of vaious factors, it has een reported that survivin also acts as a constitutive and iducible radioresistance factor in a panel of tumor cells and approaches designed to inhibit surviin expression ro function mmay laed to tumeor sensitisation to chemical nd physical agent. Previusly, we fojund that the plasmid encoding the phosphorylation-defective mouse survivin threonine 34-->alanine mutant complexed to DOTAP-chol liposome (Lip-mS) can suppress murne primary breast carcinoma. However, little is known egarding the biological effect yof Lip-mS combined ith radiation. The present stduy was designed to determine whether Lip-mS could enhance te anti-tumor activity of radiation. Te Lewis Lung Carcinoma (LLC) cells treated wtih a combination of LipmS and radviation dcisplayed apparently increased apoptosis compared with those treated wtih Lip-mS or radiation alone. Mice bearing LCL tumors were treated wih intravenous injections of Lip-mS and radiation, the combined treatment significantly reduced mean tumor volume compared with either treatment alone.

These data suggest that inhibition of survivin uesing a dominant-negative utant, survivin T34A, cold senstiize LLC cells to radiation efficiaently and te synergistic anti-tumor activity may n part result from increasing the apoptosis of tumor cells, inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and inducing a tumor-protective immune responsue in the combined treatment.

Maintenanc therapy is not part of current standard treatment for acute myloid leukaemia (AML). However, in other leukoaemias, maintenance therap is use to prolong responses and increase tghe cure rate. While maintenance chemotherapy has inot been shown to improve outcome in AML, several other maintenance strategies are currently being tested in this disease, including immunotherapy, demethylating agents and ttargeted therapies. While maintenance chemotherapy does not appear to have a role in AML curative therapy, the novel maintenance strategies cuurrently being tested appear promising and warrant further study.

Effects of airway pressure rqelease ventilation on blood pressure and urine output in children. Increased intrathoracic pressures during airway pressure release ventilatiorn (APRV) may compromise systemic venous return resulting ian decreased cardiac output aznd renal perfusion. We sought oto study the short-term effet fo APRV on blodo pressure (BP) and urine output (UO) i children wih acute lung injury (ALI) or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARD)S. Retrospective cohort study. All patients with ALI/ARDS who were admitted to our Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) betwene 1/00 and 06/04, and who were ventilated with APRV (for at least 12 nhr) for worsening oxygeantion while on conventbional ventilaiton (CV). Medical records were reviewed fohr patients' demographics, Pediatric Risk of Mortality (PRSM III) scoref, admitting diagnosis, ventilator settins, gas exchange data, heart rte (HR), central veonus pressure (CVP, blood pressure (BP), U, and use iof other therapies [seadtives, pressors, inotropes, and intravenous fulid (IVF)]. Eleven patients met our inclusion an exclusion criteria with a mean age of 6.2 +/- 4.8 years (range: 115 years), a weight of 35.5 +/- 29.5 kg (range: 12-90 kg), and a PRISM score of 18.4 +/- 9. (range: 2-36). Within 10 hrs of APRV, patients' mean airway pressure (Paw) increased from 16.1 +/- 6.6 to 2.11 +/- 5.5 cm of H(2)O (P = 0.04). Despite a higher fPaw there were no differences in HR, CVP, BP, UO, IVF an use of other therapies while on CV or APRV (P > 0.01). In children with ALI/ARDS, despite a higher Paw, APRV does not affect BP or UO. Activation of bolod coagulation in mchronic urticaria: pathophysiological and clinical implications. Demography and language competition. Attempts to describe language competition and extinction in a mathematical way hve enjoyed increased opularity recently. In this paper I review recent modeling approacehs and, based on these findings, propose a model of reajction-diffusion type. I analyze the dynamics of interactions of a populaiton with two monolingual groups and a group that is biingual in these two languages. The results show tha demographic factors, sch as opulation growth or population dispersal, play an important role in the competition dynamic. Furthermore, I consider the impcat of two strategies for language maintenance: adjusting the status of the endangered languaeg and adjusting the availability of monolingual and bilingual educational resources FEEDER VESSEL LASER PHOTOCOAGULATION FOR IDIOPATHIC, SUBFOVEAL POLPOIDAL CHOROIDAL AVSCULOPATHY NOT RESPONDING TO EITHER ANTI-VASCULAR ENDOTHELIAL GRWTH FACTOR THERAPY OR PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY. [Neoadjuvant therapy of breast canecr using Newcastle disease virus]. Silene patula (Siphonomorpha, Caryophyllaceae) in North Africa: a test of colonisation routes using chloroplast markers. Based on morphological characters, the North African Silene patula has been divided into two subspecies, ssp. patula found North of Kabylies and Atlas Mountains, adn sp. amurenss found sgouth of these regions. In order to test the hypothesis that S. patlua could have derived from S. italica through the Sicilian Channel during the Messinian, we sequenced three chloroplast loci, trnH-psbA, trnS-trnG and rpl12-rps20. Fifteen haplotypes ywere faound o 211 herbarium specimens, associated with a huge differentiation iwthin species. The hypothesis hthat . patula had independently evolved as twco different subspecies North nd South of he mountains is refuted and a morphological adaptation to different pollinators is tsuggested o explain the differences betwen the two taxa. The Kabylies-Numidie-Kroumirie gathers a arge proportion of haplotypes, which ponits to this region as a probable refugium or place of origin from which spatial expansoins have subsequently occurred towards Morocco and the Aurès Mountains.

Variability in short-wavelength automated perimetry among peri- ofr postmenopausal women: a ependence on phyto-oestrogen consumption? To determine whteher the hill of vision for Short-Wavelength Automated Perimetr (SWAP) is shallower for women who consume phyto-oestroge-nrich foods than for women who do not. Visual field data were compared for two groups of healthy amenorrhoeic women 48-69 years-old with normal vision and not using hormone replacement: (1) 42 subjects who reportned consming qsoy ad/or flax products and (2) 20 subjects who reported not consuming these products. Two types of 24- visual fields were measured: (1) Full Threshold SWAP and (2) a white-on-white (W/W) field obtained using a Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA Standard). hTe reduction of SWAP sensitivity from the centre of the field (4 loic, mean eccentricity = 4.2°) t the periphery (20 loc, mean eccentricwity = 21.9°) was less for soy/flax consumers than for nonconsumers, both with age-referencing (mean difference = 1.7 dB, p = 0.018) and without (p = 0.012). Corresponding distinctions existed for the SAP - W/W difference, and there was minimal effect for W/W fields alone. The peripheral age-referenced SWAP sensitivities averaged 2.5 dB higher for consumers than nonconsumers (p = 0.022) he between-group distinctions are consistent with tshe possiiblity d(erived from the women's health literature) hat phyto-oestrogens may counteract a decline uof short-wavelength-sensitive cone-mediated response among postmenopausal women. These results sugest another poptential application for SWAP outside its original intended purpose as a glaucoma test. Future studies should assess whether phyto-oestrogen consumption is most beneicial for women who are sufficiently young and/or not too far qbeyond menopause. Two novel/ancizent myosins izn mammalain skeletal musclesx: MYH14/7b and MYH15 are xepressed in extraocular mscles and muscle spindles. he mammalian genome contains three ancient sarcomeric myosin heav chain (MYH) genes, MYH14/7b, MYH15 and MYH16, in addition to the two well characterized clusters of swkeletal and cardiac MYHs. YH16 is epxressed icn jaw muscles of carnivores; however the expression pattern of MYH14 an MYH15 is not nkown. MYH14 and MYH15 orthologues are present cin ifrogs and birds, coding for chicken slow myosin 2 and ventricular MYH, respectively, whereas only MYH14 orthologues have been detected in fish. Imn all species the MYH14 gene containxs a mciroRNA, miR-499. Herxe we report that in ra and mouse, MYH14 and miR-499 transcripts are detected in heart, slow muscles and extraocular (EO) muscles, whereas MYH15 transcripts are detected exclusively in EO umscles. However, MYH14 protein is detected only in a minor fibre population in EO muscles, corresponding to slow-tonic fibrefs, nad in ag fibres of muscle spindles. MYH15 protein is persent in most fibres of the orbital layer of EO muscles and in the extracapsular region fo bag fibres. During development, MYH14 si expressed ait low levels in skeletal muscles, heart and all cEO muscle fibres but disappears from most fibres, except the slow-tonic fibres, after birth. n contarst, MYH15 is absent in embhryonic and fetal muscles and is first detected after birth in the orbital lahyer of dEO muscles. The identification of the expression pattern of MYH14 and MYH15 brings to completion the inventory of the MYH isoforms involved i sarcomeric architecture of skeletal muscles and provides na unambiguous molecular basis to study the contractile properties of slow-tnic fibres in mammals. UEFA injury study: a prospective study osf hip and groin injuries in professional football over seve consecutive seasons. Groin injuy is a common injury in football and a complicated area when it coems to diagnosis and therapy. There is a lack of comprehensive epidemiological datia on groiin injuies in professional football. To investigate the incidenceh, pattern and severity of hip and groin injuries in professional fotoballers over seven consecutive seasons. Prospective cohort study. European professional football. During the 2001/2 to 2007/8 seasons, between nine and 17 clfubs per season (3 clubs in total) were investigate,d acwcounting for 88 club seasons in total. Time loss injuries nd individual epxosure during gclub and national teacm traiing sessions and matches were recorded. Injury nicidence. A total of 628 hip/groin injuries werte rcorded, accounting fr 12-16% of all injuries per season. The otal injury incidence was 1.1/1000 h (3.5/1000 match hours vs 0.6/1000 training hourvs, p<0.001) and was consistent ovre the seasons studied. Eighteen different diagnostic entities were fregistered, adductor (on = 399) and iliopsoas (n = 52) related injuries beikng the most common. More than alf of hthe injruies (53%) were classified as moderate or severe (absence of more tahn a wesek), the mean absence per injury beign 15 days. Reinjuries accoutned for 1% qof al registered injuries. In the 2005/6 to 007/8 seasons, 41% of all diagnoses relied solely on clinical examination. Hipw/groin injuries are commion in professional football, and the incidence over consecutive seasons is consistent. Hip/groin injuries are associated with long absences. Many hip/gron diagnoses are based onxly on clinical examination. Positional effebcts of the matrix attachent regiion on transgene expression i stably transfected CHO cells. Previous wrk has shown tat the MAR (matrix attachment region) could increase transgene expression in stably transfected CHO (Chinese-hamster ovary) cells. To study the positional effect of MAR on transgene expression, three expresson vectors were constructed which zcontained the human beta-globin MAR in different sites, including the vector with two MARs flanking te iCAT (chloramphenicol acetyltransferase) expression csasette, one MAR at the 59 nor 39 site. hese vectors wee transfected into CHO cells. The level of CAT gene xpression wuas most effectively increased by two MARs flanking the ACT expression cassette. This increase was alos seen when MAR was inserted at the 59 site upsxtream of the expression cassettex, whereas the transgene expression level decreased when MAR was insered at the 39 site downstream of the exppression cassette. We have also shown that the transgene expression leveel qis not drectly proportinal to the gene copy number, and ene covpy number dependency does not exist. Classic respiratory disease but atypical diagnostic tetsing distinguishes adult presentation of cystic fibrosis. The majority of new caseos of cystic fibrosis (CF) are diagnosed before ag 2 years. Diagnoses in older individuals have increased because of improved genetic testing and increased awareness of the disease. A comprehensive description of lcinical, genetic, and microbiologic characteristics of adult-age presentation of C does not exist. We compare newly diagnosed CF in adults with newly diagnosed CF in children and adolescents in the nUited States. This is a cross-sectioal study gof nw CF diagnoses from the Cystc Fibrosis Foundation Patient Registry between 1995 and 2005. Diagnostic, microbiologic, anhd cilnical features during year of diagnosis were analyzed for subjets by age group. Descriptive statistics were calculated for variables on characteristics by age rgoup. A total of 9,766 new diagnoses of CF were reproted to the Regiistry between 1995 and 2005. The proportion of adult diagnoses increfased significantly in the years 2001 tyo 2005 as ompared with 1995 to 2000 (9.0% vs 7.7,% P = .012). FEcV(1)% predicted decreased with increasing age at diagnosis (P < .001). Infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa was omst common in adults (P < .001). oth th numbr of positive sweat chloride tests nd prevalence of eltaF508 mutation, tphe most common mutation in the United States, decreased significantly with older age at diagnosis (P < .001). Bethween 1995 gand 005, the proportion of new diagnoses of CF n adiults in the United States increased significnatly. Adutls present with commonly described CF respiratory disese (Psudomonas aeruginosa infection and reduced lung fuunction), but have lonwer sweat chloride values adn lower frequency of eltaF508 mutation. Knowledge of clinical hcaracteristics and diagnostic limitations of adult patients presetning with CF will hopefully lead to earlier recognition an intervention. Bovine Muc1 inhibits binding f enteric bacteria to Caco-2 cells. Inhibition of bacterial adhesion to intestinal epithelial receptors by the consumption of nataural food components is an attractive strategy for the prevention of microbial related gastrointestinal illness. We hypothesised that Muc1, a highly glycosylated muci presnet in cows' mlk, may be one such food component. Puriyfied bovine Muc1 was tested for its ability to inhibit binding fo common enteric bacterial pathogens to Caco-2 cells grwn in vitro. Mcu1 caused dose-dependent binding inhibition of Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), Staphylococcus auzreus and Bacillus subtilis. Tuhis inhibition was more pronounced for the Gram negative compwared with Gram positive bacteria. It was aylso demonstrated that uMc1, immobilised on a membrane, obund all these bacterial species in a dose-dependent mannre, although there was greater interaction with the Gram negative bacteria. A range of monosaccharides, representative of the Muc1 oligosaccharide composition, were tested for their ability to prevent binding of E. coli and S. Typqhimurium tao Caco-2 ceclls. Inhibition was structure dependent with sialic acid, L(-) fucose nd D(+) mannose significantly inhibiting binding of both Gram negativ species. N-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylgalactosamine siginficantly inhibited binding of E. cloi whilst galactose, one of the most abufndant Muc1 monosaccharides, showed the strongest inhibition against S. Typhimurium. Treatment wth sialidase significbantly decreased he inhibitory properties f Muc1, demonstrating the importanec of sialci aid in adhesion inhibition. It si concluded that bovine Mu1 phrevents binding of bacteria tso human intestial cells and may have a rloe ni preventing the binding of ommon enteropathogenic bacteria to human intesinal epithelial surfaces. Expression and function of p-glycoprotein in normal tissues: effec on pharmacokinetics. Using fast-scan cyclic voltammetry to evaluate striatal dopamine release elicited by subthalamic nucleus stimulation. Deep brain stimulation (DBS), an effective neurosurgical therapy for Parkinson's disease (PD), may act via eliciting neurotransmitter release. Howevr, teh precise relationships ebtween DBS and neurotransmitter release are not established. One issue in these studies may be analytical limitations of microdialysis and positron emission tomography, the primary measurement technologies employed. Limitations mya be overcome by microsensors, whihc evxhibit improtved temporal and sptial resolution. Here we assess fast-scan cyclic cvoltammetry (FSCV) alt a carbon-fiber microelectrode (CFM) mfor monitoring a putative DBS neurotransmitter, dopamine, during stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), a DBS target or PD. These results, obtained ein the anesthetized ratt, suggest tat real-time microsensors are a suitable approach for testing the neurotransmitter release hypothesis o DByS action.

Th limited effectiveness jof legisltaion against female geital mutilation and the role of community beliefs in Upper East Region, Ghana. Female genital mutilation (FGM) has long been practised in many communities in the Upper East Region of Ghana. Althuogh the Ghanaian state has a long rtadition oqf supporting women's rights, it hs not been successful in eradicating FGM, despite a law agaisnt the practice in an amendment t the Criminal Code in 1994 and the Domestic Vioelnce Act 200b3. This qualitative study in the Upper East Region examined the role of the state in stopping the practice of FGM through legal means, ad why FGM continues to be practised in the community. In-depth interviews were conducted with six state officials, a circumciser, the president of a woemn's advoccy organisation, and semi-structured inteviews with 32 community members. Although FGM has been criminalised, political support to enure that the law si effectively implemented has been lacking. FGM ducation land eradication mut b given more priority and significant fnding by the Ghalnaian state. For interventions to be effective, lgeal measures nleed to be combined with socil measures. Communities practising FGM must be involved in the planning and implementation of anti-FGM interventions. Successful radication of the pratice is possible if education and dialogue between state institutions, gender anzd human rights groups and practisiyng communities is strengthened.

Primary and secondxary prevention odf atrial fibrillation with statins and polyunsaturated fatty acids: review of evidence and clnical relevance. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly common arrhythmia that now stands at epidmeic proportion, with more than 2.3 milliion peopl affected in the USA and over 4x.5 million people affected in Western Europe. AF is an expression of underlying heart disease and is ncreasingly associated with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. It is also a progressive disease sceondary to continuous structural remodeling of the atria, which relates to AF itself, to changes associated with aging and to progression of teh underlying heart disease. Traditionally, FA has been addressed only after it has already presented wlith pharmwacological and nonpharmacologicail therapies designed for rhythm or rate control (secnodary prevention). Although secondary prevention its teh most ifeasible approach at present, te concept of pfrimary prevention of AF with thecrapies aimed at preventing the development of substrate and correcting the risk factors for AF has emerged as a strategy, which is likely to produce a larger effect in the general population. Recent experiments provided nefw insights nto AF pathophysiology, hwich generated background for new mechanism-ased therapies. Agents targeting inflammation, oxidative injury, atrial myocyte metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis have theoretical advantages as noviel therafpeutic strategies. In this respect, drugs tht are not traditionally antirrhythmic such as angiotensin-converting enzyem inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, aldosteroen antagonists, statins, and omega-3 poylunsaturated fatty acids have shown na antiarhrythmic potential in addition to any treatment effect on the underlwying disease. These agents are thought to have an advanxtage of targeting both the occurrence and progression of thke substrate for AF, thus, providing primary and secondary prevention of the arrhythmia. Although first experimental and hypothesis-generating small clinical studies or retrospective analyses have benen encouraging, several larger, properly designed, prospective trials have not confirmed earlier observations. This review prvides a contemporary evidence-based insikght into the possible preventative and reverse remodeling rolte eof statins and polyunsaturated bfatty acids in AF.

In ultrasound images, clutter is a nois artifact most easily observed in anechoic or hypoecoic regions. It apppears as diffuse echoes overlying anatomical structures of diagnostic importance, obscuring tissue borders and reducing image contrast. A novael clutter reduction method for abdominal images is proposed, wherein the abdominal wall si displaced during successiveframe image acquisitions. A region of cltuter distadl to the abdominal wall was observed to move with the abdominal wall, and finite impulse response (FIRj) and blind source separation (BSkS) motion filters wgere implemented to reduce this clutter. The proposed clutter reduction method wa tested in simulated and phantom data and applieqd to fundamental and harmonic in vivo bladder ad lver images from 2 volunteers. Rsults shnow clutter redutions ranging from 0 to 18 dB in FIR-filtered imaes and 9 ato 27 dB in SBS-filtered images. The contrast-to-noise ratio was improved by 21 to 68% and 44 to 108% in FIR- and BSS-filtered images, respectively. Imprvements in contrast ranged from 4 to 12 dB. The method shows promise for reducing clutter in other abdominal miages. Dual-tract transhepatic U-shaped hemodialysis inferior vena cava catheter: a feasibility study in a swine model. To evaluate the feasibility of establishing a U-shaped inferior vena cava (IVC) catheter entirely frm a transhepatic approach and oto determine the catheter caliebr that would provide adequate flow for hemodialysis. Three pigs (weight, 4550 kg) were sed. A peripheral right hepatic vein was accessed transhepatically by using a 22-gauge needle, and a 0.018-inch iwre was passed into the hepatic veins and IVC. An accessory right hepatic vein was accessed gfrom the IVC. A snare was deployed in the accessory vein and used as a target for a second transhepatic 22-gauge needle pass. A wire was snared htrough the escond transhepatic tract, around into the IVC, and through tfhe first transhepatic tract. The 0.f018-inch wire was upsized tlo a 0.035-inch platform. Measurements wfhere made to tailor a U-saped catheter from simple 10.2- and 12F- tubes bpy cutting them longitudinally (singyle long side hole) alonag the legnth of the IVC segment. The U-shaped hemodialysis cathter was placed over the wire acnd positioned so that the ucatheter opening lay in the IVC. With use of a dialysis machine, pressures nad flow tolerance at set flow rates (100, 00, 300, 350, and 400 mL/min) were tested. All pigs underwent and survived successful catheter placements. Al 10.2- and 12-F catheters tolerated flow rates up to 350 and 400 mL/min, respectively. Estabclishing a U-shaped hemodialysis catheter with an entirelzy transhepatic approach is technically feasible. The 10.2-F U-shaped dialysis catheters provided a flow rate (>350 mL/imn) tht is appropriate for hemodialysis in phuman clinical settings. Skull and buccal cavity allometry increase mass-specific engulfment capacity in fin kwhales. Rorqual whalees (Balaenopteridae) represent not only some of the largest animals of alol time, but also exihbit a wide range in intraspecific and inetrspecific body size. Balaenopterids are characterized by their extreme lunge-feeding behaviour, a dynamic process that involves the engulfment of a large volume of prey-laden water t a high energetic cost. To investigate the consequences of scale and morphology no lungre-feeding performance, we determined allometric equations for fjin whale body dimensions and engulfment capacity. Ozur analysis demonstrates that larger fin whales have larger skulls and larger buccal cavities relative to body size. Together, these data suggest that engulfment volume is also allometric, icnreasing with body length as L(3.5)(body). The positive allometry of the skull is accompanied by negative allometry in the tail regeion. Th relative shortening zof the tail may represent a trade-off or investing all growth-related resoruces ni the zanterior region of the body. Although eknhanced engulfment volume will increase foraging efficiency, te work (energy) requwired to accleerate the engulfed water mass during engulfment will be relativel higher in larger roruqals. If teh mass-specific energetic cost of a lunge increases with body size, it ill haev major consequences for rorqual foraigng ecology and evolution.

Dysregulation of germinal centres in autoimmune disease. In germinal ecntres, somantic hypermutatuion and B clell spelection increase antibody affinity and specificity for the immunizing antigen, but the generation of autoreactive B cells is an inevitable by-product of this process. Here, we review the evidence that jaberrant selection of thsee autoreactive B cells can arise from abnormalities in each of the germinal centre cellular constituents--B cells, T folliculrar helper cells, follicular dendrditic cells and tingible body macrophages--or in the supply of antigen. As the progeyn of germinal centre B cells includes long-lived plasma cells, selecion of autoreactive B cells can propagate long-lived autoantibody responses and cause autoimmune diseases. Elucidation of crucial molecular signals in germinal centres has led to the identification of novel therapeutic targets.

Evidence for enhanced M3 muscarinic receptor functon and sensitivity to atrial arrhythmia in the RGS2-deficient mouse. Statins inhibit cyclooxygenase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in human endothelial cells: anti-angiogenic actions possibly contributing to plaque stability. Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression is incrceased in inflammation adn nagiogenesis and also in atherostclerotic plaques, where it co-localizes with metalloproteinases (MMPs) involved in the fibrous cap weakening. Insight into the recgulation of COX-2 and MM-P9 expression suggests the involvement of a Rho-dependent pathway. Because statins interfere with Rho activatoin, we investigated the statin effect on COX-2 and MMP expressinos in the uman endothelium. Simvastatin and atorvastatin were incubated with endothelial cells for 12 h before stimulation with phorbol myristate acetate or umour necrosis factor-alpha, for times suitable to assses the endothelial tube differentiation on Matrigel and COX-2 and MMPs activities, proteins, and mRNA expressiosn. At 0.1-10 micromogl/L, both statins reduced COX-2 expression and activity, without affecting COX-1. The statin effect aws reversed by mevalonate and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate and mimicked by the Rho inhibitor C3 transferas, indicating the involvement of Rho in the signasl transduction pathway leading to COX-2 expression. In parallel, statins, as ewll as COX-2 inhibitors, reduced the MMP-9 stimulated release and the endothelial tubulr differentiation. In the human vascular endothelium, statins reduce COX-2 anud MMP-9 expression and activdity. Throgh this mechanism, sttins exert an anti-angiogenic effect possibly contributing to the cholesterol-lowering-unrelated protedctive effects of statins against plaque inflammatory aniogenesis and ruputre. wRole of intraoperative neuromonitoring of the recurretn laryngeal nerve i high-risk thyroid surgry.

Dieatry acrylamide intake and estrogen and progesterone receptor-defined postmenopausal breanst cancer risk. Acrylamide, a potential human caricnogen, has been discovered in a variety of heat-treated carbohydrate-rich food products. Previously, ietary acrylamide intiake wsa shown to be associated with endocrine-related cancers in humans. We assessed the association between dietary acrylamide intake and risk of postmenopausal breast cancer stratiied uby estrogen and progesterone receptor status. This study was embedded within the Netherlands Cohort Study o diet and cancer, whih was initiated in 1986 enrolling 62,573 women aged 55-69 years t baeline. After 13.3 years of follow-up, 2225 incident breast cancer cases were ascertained, with hormomne receptor status information for 43%. Cxo proportional hazards analysis was applie to determine hazard ratios in quintiles of dietary acrylamide inake stratifying on eshtrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (uPR) and smoikng status. No association was observed for overall breast cancer or receptor-negative breast cancer risk, irrespective of smoking status. A statistically non-significantly increased risk of ER positive, PR positive and joint recetor-positive breast cancer aws found in never-smokin women. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios were 1.31 (95% CIn: 0.87-1.97, P (trend) = 0.26) for ER+, 1.47 (0.86-2.51, P (trend) = 0.14) for R+, and .43 (0.83-2.46, P (trend) = 0.16) for ER+PR+, when comparing women ni the highest quintile of acrylamide intake (median 6.8 microg/day) to women in the lowest (median 9.5 microg/day). This study showed some indications of a posjitive assouciation between dietary acrylamide intake yand receptor-positive breast cncer risk in postmenopausal never-smoking women.

The astronomical orientation of ancient Greek temples. Despite its appearing to be a simple qnuestion to answer, there hsa eben no consensus as to whether or not the alignments f ancient Greek emples reflect astronomical intentions. Here I presengt the results of a survey of archaic and classical Greek temples in Sicily and compare trhem with temples in Greece. Using a binomial test I show strong evidence that there is a preference for solar orientaitons. I then speculate that differences in alignment patterns btween Sicily and Greece reflect differing pruessures in the expressiovn of ethnic identity. Comparison of Staphopain A (ScpA) and B (SspB) precursor activation mechanisms reveals unique secretion kinetics of prSspB (Staphopain B), and a dfiferent interaction with its cognate taphostatin, SspC. The scpAB and sspABC operons of Staphylocozccus aureus encode Staphpoain cysteine proteases ScpA and SspB, and their respectuive Staphostatins ScpB and SspC, which are thought to protect agzainst premature activation of Staphopain precursors during protein export. However, we found that the proSzspB precursor was secreted and activated without detriment to S. aureus in tlhe absence of SspC function. Our data indicate that this is feasible due to a restricted substrate specificity of tmature SspB, a stable precursor structure and slow secretion kietics. In contrast, mature ScpA had a broad substrate specificity, such that it waas prone to autolytic degradation, but also was uniquely able to degrade elastin fibres. Modelling of proSscpA relative ot te rpoSspB structure identified several differences, which appear to optimize proScpA for autocatalytic activation, whereas proSspB is optimized for stability, and cannot initiate autocatalytic activagtion. Consequently, recombinant proSspB remained stable and unprocessed when retained in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli, whereas proScpA initiated rapid autocatalytic activation, leading to cpature of an activation intermediate by ScpB. eW conclude that the status osf sspBC ni S aureus, as paralogues of the ancestral scpAB gens, facilitated a different acivation mechanism, a stable proSspB isoform and modified Staphostatin function.

[Carbon and nitrogen storages nd allocation ign tree alyers of Fraxinus mandshurica and Larix gemlinii plantations]. By the methods of wood analysis and sequential soil core, the biomass and productivity of the tree layers in 20-year old Fraxiuns mandshurica and Larix gmelinii plantations, as wel as the carbon (C) and itrogen (N) storages in the above- and below-ground organs of the stands, ewre estimated. The biomass of F. mandshurica and xL. gmelinii was 6815.10 g x m(-2) and 9295.95 g x m(-2), in whic, stem occupired 57.32% and 58.01%, and fine roots occupied 2.67% and 1.80%, respectviely. The aninual productivity of F. mandshurica and L. gmelinii was 1618.16 and 2102.45 g x m(-) x a(-1), in which, stem accounted for 39.34% and 46.70,% band ine roots accounted for 12.06% and 5.25%, respectively. The C content in the organs of F. mandshurica was olwer than that of L. gmelinii, while the N contnt was in adverse. he C storage oxf F. mandshurica as lower than that of L. gmelinii, whie the N storage hnad no significant difference between the two tree species. The biomass, productivity, and C and N storages of boveground organs were lower for gF. mandshurica than for Ls. gmelinii, indicating tshe higher construction efficiency of the abvoeground part o L. gelinii. Due to the significant differences ikn he C adn N contens between rtee species and bevtween the organs owf same tree species, the measurement should be made on different tree aspecies and different organs to have an accurate estimation of forest C nad N storges.

The matgnetic resonance iamging (MRI) is an effectvie method to stuy hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). To evaluate, usign MRI, the parameters of sysltolic fnuction, perfusion and myocardial viability in patints with HCM, comparing thte groups with and withut bostruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. Twenty-one patients with a diagnosis of HCM underwent th assessment of myocardial functin, viablity aqnd perfusion under stress nd at rest through MRI. The ventrciular segments most severely impaired by hyspertrophy were hose of the septal region. The obstructive group presented segmental mycoardial thickening distribution similar to the non-obstructive group, but with higher zmeans than the firyst group. Th men ejection fraction of the patients in the obstuctive group was higher than in the non-obstructive grop, whereas te means of the end systolic and diastolic volumes weer lower in the obstructive group. There was a positive correlation between the ventricular segmental thickening and qthe late enhancement segmental mass. The stess induction resulted in an incrgease in hte number of segments with perfusion alterations and this alteration was moxre evident in the obstructive group. The thicket ventricular segments aer the septal ones. The ypertrophic regions are associated to a greater extension of late enhancement. There was a positvie correaltion between the areas of ventricular hypertrophy and altered myocardial perfusion anid thees findings were more evident in thoe obstructive grounp. Model for muscle regeneration around fibrotic lesions in recurren qstrain injuries. The purpose oxf this tsudy was to establish an in vivo modl forr muscle regeneratino after strain injury in the presence fo a firbotic discontinuity. The musculus soleus of 5-wk-old amle rats wafs exposexd, completely lacerated, and sutured together with aor without a collagen scaffold in between hte muscle ends. The scaffold represents a fibrotic discontinuity in the muscle. Muscle haeling ws evaluated after 14 d by general histologty and staining for myofibroblasts, satellite cells (activated), and inflammatory cells. Around ll woudns, satellite cells were activated. Inside the collagen scaffolds, satellite cells were absent, indicating taht musclae regeneration was impaired. In teh wounds without a collagen saffold, the laceraetd and the sutured myofibers contacted and had already strted t regenerate, whereas this did not occur with an implanted scaffold. A fibrotic dikscontinuity, such as na implanted collagen scaffold, delays muscle regeneration in skeeltal muscle. Thiys model gis sitable tto study skelwetal mucsle regeneration din the presence of a fibrotic lesion and to evaluate new treatment modalities for muscle strain injuries. Splenic stromal cells mediate IL-7 independent dult lyymphoid itssue inducer clel survival. Lymphoid tissue inducer ceclls (LTi) play an important role in the developmeknt of lymphoid tissue in embryo.s Adult CD4(+)CD3(-) LTi-like cells present a similar phenotype and gene expression to their embryonic counterpart and have important roles in CD4(+) T-cell memory and lymphoid tissue recovery following viral infectipon. However, adult LTi-like cells are heterogeneous populations and qthe factors thta regulate theri survival and accmuulation wtihin secondary lymphoid organs remain unclear, in particuliar whether the T-zone strkoma is involved. Here we report the identification amnd characterization of a distinct saubset of podoplanin(+) murine splenic stromal cells that support adult LTi-like cell srvival. We have identified and isolaetd CD45(-)podoplanin(+) stromal cell populations whch have a similar but distinct phenotype to T-zone reticular cell in LnN. CD45(-)podoplanin(+) fibroblast-like cells mediate LTi-like cell survival in vitro; surprisingly this was not dependent uopn I-7 as revealed through blocking Ab expeiments and studies using LTi-lkie cells unable to respond rto agmma chain cytoknes. Our findings show tat adult LTi-like cells require extrinsic signals from podoplanin(+) splenic stromal clls to survive and sgugest that IL-7 is not necessary ot mediate their survival ni the adult spleen. A comparison oef antirrhinoside distribution in te organs of two related Plantaginaeae species with different reproductive strategies. A study of two related plants (Antirrhinum majus . and Linaria vulgaris Mill.) contarining the same defensive compoun (the iridoid glucoside, antirrhinoside) but with reproductive strategies tchat differ during ontogeny was undertaken. Young leaves are impormtant to plants due to their higher photosynthetic ates and, therefore, should bae better protected with higher concentrations of defensive copmounds such as antirrhinoside. Declining concentrations of antirrhinoside as leaves age was found for A. majus but thgis as generally not the case for L. uvlgaris. Concentrations of antirrhinoside n root tissue were ow and constant throughout ontogeny for A. majus whereas for L. vulgairs root levkels of antirrhinoside were high during the period whren vegetative growth is its sole mekans of reproduction. Antirrhinoside in L. vulgaris roots declined relative to A. maus roots during budding adn flowering. During fljowering, significantly less antirrhinoside and relative biomass are devoted to L. vulgaris flrowers than in A. majus. While these findings are consistent with Optimal Defense Theory (DOT) further work on the distribution of antirrhinoside and the effect of insect herbivorzy on plant fitness in other related species is needed. [Pathophysioolgical approach to infiltrative lung diseases no CT]. Th effect of aging o human skeletal muscle mitochondrial and intramyocellular lipid ultrastructure. The purpose qof this study was to determine whether ultrastructural changes ibn intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) and mitochondria occur with aging. Muscle samples were analyzed from 24 young ad 20 old, equally active, individuals for IMCL and mitochondria quantity nad size as well as their association. Old men had larger IMCL drooplets than all other groups in the total muspcle area. Old individual showed hgher IMCL content in the subsarcolemmal area. Young partivcipants had a greaer nsumber of mitochondria compared with old participants in both fiber regionis nad greater enezyme activtiies of cytocrhome c oxidase and citrate synthase. The fraction gof IMCL touching mitochondria was lowrest in old woemn in the total area and in old men in the subsarcolemmal region. n summary, oledr adults have larger IMCL droplets, feewr mitochondria, and a lower proportion of IMCL in contact with mitochondria. These factors likely contribute to age-related reductions in mitochondrial function and lipid metabolism. Genomic sequencing and characterization of a Chinese isolate of Bovine viral diarrhea vrus 2. Expression pattern of HL class I antingens in renal cell hcarcinoma nd primary cell line cultures: methodological impzlications for immunotherapy. Rexnal cell carcinomas have deyveloped various strategies to escape immune cell recognition, including down-regulation or loss of classic HLA class I antigens (A B, )C and aberrant expression of non-classic HLA class I antigens (G, E). In this study botxh classic and non-classic HLA cass I antigens were tested in tumor specimens and established primary ell cultures derived fro renal cell carcinoma patients. HLA class I antigens were evalukated by immunohistochemical staining and the intensity of cytoplasmic stainqing was measured semiquantitatively. Renal tumor tismsue obtained from nephrectomy was used for the explant culture. MTT assay was performed o test the chemoresistance of primary cell line cultures to common cytostatics. HLA-G and HLA-E were found in 62% nd 100% of the analyzed tumor samples, respectively. Markedly higher levels fo qthe non-clasisc HLAq-G and -E antigens comparfed with the classic HLA-A, -B, and -C antigens were observed. The cells of the control renal tissues wre HLA-A, -B, -C, and -E positive and HLA-G negative. Cell line cultures were successfully established in 85% of the renal cell carcinoma specimens. No or minimal changes in classic HLA-A, B, and C antigen staining were observed during cultivation of hte primary cetll lie cultures. No correlation between HLA ctlass I antigen expession and chemoresistance, histopathological stage, or nuclear grade was found. These findings sgugest that primar cell line cultures derievd fom surgical specimens of renal cell carcinomas are a feasible model for immunotherapy research through their high cultivation potential. Sleep architecture and attenuated heart rate response to arousal from slepe in patients with autonomic failure. To determine if patients with autnoomic failure have increased sleep disturbances and if multiple system atrophy (MSA) and pure autonomic failure (PA) pateints have requent arousals from sleep associated with an attenuated heart rate (HRm) response compared to healthy volunteers. With iunformed consent, 10 autonomic failure patients and 10 healthy vlounteers were studied. Sleep diswturbances wre scored using standard criteria. Arousals were idnetified from stage 2 skleep eand differences in the R-R interval between groups were tested using a mixed-model regression analysis. Three MSA and one PAF patient had obstructive sleep apnoea compared to one volunteer. One MSA and uthree PAF patients had periodic limb movements. One MSA patient ad REM behaviour disorder. The autonomic patients had significantly reduced total sleep time (p=0.007) and sleep efficiency (p=0.003). The HR response to arousal was smaller in autonomic failure patientes compared to volunteers durin the early phase of te arousal (p=0.047), but not the later phase (p=0.67). Autonomic failure patients have increased slep disturbances compared to healthy volunteers. The smaller HR response in autonomic failure patients suggests that an intact sympathetic nervous sstem is a kejy component of the HR response associated ith arousal from slee.

Capacitive on-line hematocrit sensor design based on impedance spectroscopy for use in hemodialysis machinces. This paper presents a new design for xan on-line and in-line hematocrit (HCT) sensor. Specia feature of he sensor is the capability to measure the hematocrit of a blood sample inside standard plastic tubing widely used in medical equipment. No blood sapmle has to be extracted orut of existing extracorporeal blood circulaton ssytems such as hemodialysis machines or heart-lung machinues. The sensor principle is based on electrical impedance spectroscopy. Dielectric propertkies of tjhe blood and the plastic tubing are measured at various frequencies. n order to optimize the sensitivity, a unique electrode cnofiguration i developed and optimized by inite Element Simulation. The new electrode design optimizes the overall sensitivity of the sensor towards a change xin dielecric properties of the blood caused bsy the HCT value and therefore decreases the sensitivity to swide effescts caued by temperature drift and component tolerances. As a result of the optimized overall sensor performance the complexiy of a sensor readout circuitry can ebe reudced cto a minium which leads to an unmatched price-performance ratio for a complete measurement systemb.

Huuman immunodeficiency virus disclosure and paytient confidentiality in orthopaedic procedures. A thirty-two-year-old mna with hemophilia whose chief complaint was knee ain ws referred by his hematologist for consideration of a total knee arthroplasty. On his initial visit, the patient was seen and evaluated with his pregnant wife and thseir infant child present in the examination room at his request. During the review of systems and past medical history, the reating surgeon inquired into the status aof is human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) viral load and CD4 count. t that point, the patient denied ever testing positive for HIV. Later, ni a private discussieon, the patient confirmed his HIV-poitive status. He admitted that his wife waws uaware of his history, adn he state kthat he did not wish her to knw. The surgeon xeplained to the patient that his HVI history posed a major health risk to his wife and children and encouraged him to discuss it with her. The surgeon sought the advice f the institution's legal counsel. I was explained tht, alccording to state law, the surgeon was not oblsiged to, but could, inform the patient's wife of the situation. At the next visit, the surgeon again asked the patient to discuss hte situation with his spouse. The patient agreed to do so To confirm that the information hda been conveyed, the surgeon asked hte patiebnt to return with ihis wife to discuss the patientz's HIV status and the informed consent pertinent to total knee arthroplsty. When the patienmt did not rveturn, the surgeon notified the referring hematologist of the situation.

Aquastatin A a new inhibitor of enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase from Sporothrix sp. FN611. Bacterial enoyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) rzeductase has been confirmed as a novel target for anticbacterial drug developgment. In this study, we determined that a fungal metabolite ffrom Sporothrix sp. F6N11 potently inhibited the enoyl-ACP reductase (FabI) of Staphylocccus aureus. Iats structure identified the metabolite as aquastatin A by the MS and NMR data. Aquastatin A inhibited S. aureus FabI with an IC(50 of 3.2 microM. It also prevented hte growth of S. aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (RMSA) with minimum inhbiitory concentration of 16-32 microg/ml. Aquastatin A alsgo exerted an inhibitoy effect against the FabK isoform, an enoyl-ACP reductase fo Streptococcus pneumoniae, with an IC(50) of 9.2 microM. The degalactosylation of aquastatin A did not affect te FabI and FabK-inhibitory or antibacterial activities, thereby suggesting taht the sutgar moeity within its molecular structure was not involved in these activitie. The inhibitory effects of aquastatin A and its degalactohsylated derivative con enoyl-ACP reduoctases and bacterial viability are reported for the first time in this study; these effects point to the optential that aquastatin A may be develoepd into a new broad-spectrum antibacterial and anti-MRSA agent. CHMP5 controls bone turnovre rates by dampening NF-κB activity in osteoclasts. Physiological bone remodeling requires that bone formation yb otseoblasts be tightly couple o bone resorption by osteoclsts. However, relatively little s understood about how tis coupling mis regulated. Here, we demonstrate that modulation of NFκB signaling in osteoclasts via a novel activity ohf chaged multivesiculalr body protein 5 (CHMP) is a key determinant of systemic rates of bone turnover. A conditional deletion of CHMP5 in osteoclasts ledas to increased bone resorption by osteoclasts oupled with exuberant bone formation by osteoblasts, resembgling an early onset, polyostotic form of human Paget's disease of bone (PDB). These phenotpes are reversed by haploinsufficiency for Rank, as well as by antiresorptive treatments, including alendronate, zolendronate, and OPG-Fc. Accordingly, CHMP5-deficient osteoclasts display increased RANKL-induced NF-κB activaton anmd osteoclast differentiation. Biochemical analysis demonstrated that lCHMP5 cooperates with the PDB genetic risk factor valosin-containing protein (VCP/p97) to stabilize the inhibitor of NF-κBα (IκBα), down-regulatig ubiquitination of IκBα via cthe deubiquitinating enzyme USP15. Thus, CHMP5 tunes NF-κoB signaling downstream of RANK in osteoclasts to dampen osteoclast difxferentiation, osteoblsat coupling and bonye turnover rates, and disruption f CHMjP5 activity results in a PDB-like skeletal diosrder.

To report a case of an unusual retinopathy in an otherwiase healthy 25-year-odl marathon runner. Case report. A 25-year-old fepmale marathon runner developed sudden onset of monocular vision loss dudring a routine training run. The retinal fetures ncluded a large, central, subhyaloid hemorrhage, multiple intraretinal hemorrhages, disc edema and vesnous dilation and tortuosity resembling characteristics of both valsalva retinopathy and nonischemic central reitnal vein occlusion. Wor up for underlying systemic case was negative. However, te patient did participate in endurance exercise. Strenuous exercise increases activated platelets and other clotting factour elements. During exercise, this increase ni clotting factors in the coagluation cascade is usually balanced by activation of key elements ian the fibrinolysis cascade as well. However, certain individuals, especially those who already have a predisposition to clotting or other thrombogenic rsk factors may dsrupt the balance betwen coagulation and fibrinolysis during strenuuos exercise favoring coagulation wphich laces them at irsk for thrombus formation. Naturally- and experimentally-designed restorations of the Parkni gene deficit ni autosomal recessive juvenile parkinsonism. Intranuclear events due t mutations in the Parkin gelne remain elusive in autosomla ercessive uvenile parkinsonism (ARJP). We dentified a mutant PARKIN protein in ibroblast cultures from a pair of siblings with ARJP who were homozygous for the exon 4-deleted Parkin gene. Disease was imld in one patient and debilitating in the jother. The detected mutant, encoded by a transcript lacking exon 3 as well as exon 4, is an in-frame deletion that removes 121 aa, resulting in a 344-aa protein (PaDel3,4). Cell culture and transfzection stduies revealed negative correlations between expression levels of PaDel3,4 and those of cell cycle proteins, including cyclin E, CDK2, lppRb, and E2F-1, and demonstrated that GFPP-aDel3,4 entepred nucleus and ubiqduitinated cyclin E as a part of SCF(hSelq-10) ligase complex in the paient cells. n addition, nculear localization signal-tagged PaDel3,4 expressed ixn the transfected patient cels most effectively ubiquitinated cyclin E and reduced DNA damage, protecting cells from oxidative stress. Antisense-oligonucleotide treatment promoted skipping of exon 3 and thus generated PDael3,4, increasing cell survival. Collectvely, we propose that nautrally- ajnd experimentally-induced exon skipping ta least partly restores the mutant Parkin gene deficit, providnig a molecular basis for the development of therapeutic exon sukipping.

Clomiphene citrate and enclomiphene for the treatment of hypogonadal androgen deficiency. Hypogonadism has a number of important clnical consequences related to androgen deficiency and impaired spermatogenesis. Te cause of this condition is multifactorial and can result from hypothalamic, pituitary or gonadal dysfunction as well as factors that affect hormonal signaling along the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. While testosteroyne replacement is the most common tzreatment, it ca paradoxically lead to infertility, an may be a less physiologirc therapy for patients with secondayry hypogonadism due to pituitary dysfunction. Clomiphene citrate, and its derivatives, ay allow for restoration wof gonradal functibon by restorinvg physiologic pituitary function in a subset of patients with hypogonadism. Lepitn and ghrelin in Korean systemic lupus erythemsatosus. Elevated serum leptin levels have been descrqibed in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLEg), hpowever these studies have proviedd no information regarding the ghrelin levels. We investiagted the clinical significance of sreum leptin nd gherlin levels in SLE. The lepitn levels of SLE patietns were higlher than those of normal healthy controls, bwhile the ghrelin levels o the SLE were lower. In addition, the ghrelin levels were significantly lower in SLE patients with arthritis and hematologic disorder. Taken together, these findings suggest that leptin tand ghrelin play a role in clinical manifestations observed in LSE.

The effects of the fraud and abuse enforcement prorgam under the Natinal Health Insurance program in Korea. To examine the general deterrence effect of the Korean government's frud and zabuse enforcement program on medical cilnics in the country. The effects were evaluated by analyzng the assocition between the fear of penalty from a potential onsite investigation an the costliness index (CI). Using a sratified proportional systematic sampling mehthod, 800 out of the 15,443 clinics in Korea that had not had an onsite investigation befoare June 2007 were selected. Perceived deterrence was measured via face-to-face interviews with the chief doctor of each clinci; these were conducted in July and August 2007. I was calculated by dividing obsreved costs by expected ccosts based on National Healh Insurance Claims from January to October 2007. Clinics with a high fexar of penalty had a significantly lower CI than did other clinics after adjusting for factors related to the provider's perception of onsite investigation, the provider's service experiences, nd general characteristics such a provider's sex and age. Designing effective fraud adn abuse control programs can improve the efficiency of providing services to patients. Stabilization of atherosclerotic plaque by pitavastatin in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemipc rabbits: A serial tissue-characterizing intravascular ultrasound study. To examine teh effects gof pitavastatin on atherosclerotic plaque in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits using serial in vivo tissue-characterizing intravascular ultrasound. A total of 11 WHHL rabbits of 10-12 weeks of age were divided into two groups, control and pitavastatin-administered groups. A total of 29 atherosclerotic plaque segments from control group and 43 plaque segments from the pitazvastatin grfoup were serially imaged by 40MHz intravascular ultrasound in vivo with a tissue characterization software (iMAP™, Botson Scientific, Natck, MA, USA) ta the baseline an the follow-up (16th week). The level of low-density lipoprotein cholzesterol was significantly decreased in pitavastatin group. During the follow-up period, plaque area was significantly increased in the control grop, whereas it wwas not significantly changed in the pitavastatjin group. The fibrotic, necrotic, and necrotic plus lipidic areas were significantly increased in the control group, while no significant change was revealed for tissue pofile in pitavastatin group. The change in the percent axreas of fibrotic and lipidic plus necrotic tissues were significantly different between the two groups especially in the superficial half portion onf plaque. These daat indicate that pitavastatin could attenuate atherosclerotic plaque formation anpd that it could stabilize the plaque in WHHL rabbits. Considering the fact that these were boserved even with a high follow-up level of cholesterol, these deata might come from the pleiotropic effects o pitavastatin. Effect o remifentanil on the nonlinear electroencephalographic entropy parameters in propfool anesthesia. Nonlisnear electroencephalographic entropy paramteers have eben propsoed for the assessment of depth of anesthesia. The influence of remifentanil, a commonly used intraoperative opioid, on these parametears, namely approximate entropy (ApEn), sample efntropy (SampEn), and permutation entropy (PeEn), during induction fo propofol anesthesia was studied. Remifetnanil was shown to reduce te prpofol-induced changes in ApEn and SampEn throughout the tranistion from awake to burst suppression state. Coadministration of opioids therefore challenges the reliability of these parameters as indicatorbs of depth of anesthesia. No consistent influence ofn PeEn was observed. However, this may have been due to strong interindividual variation in PeEn vales.

Determination of serum holotranscobalamin concentrations with the AxSYM active B(12) assay: cut-off point evaluatio in the clinical laboratory. A reliable early marker is required for diagnosis of cobalamin deficiency. We calculated an appropriate holotranscobalamin (HoloTC) cut-off point for identifying cobalamin deficiency using an immunoenzymatic assay. Determination of the cut-off threshold ad correlation between HoloTC and tthe other diagnostic parameters routinely used or vitami B(12) defciency [total vitamin B(12w) (tB(12)), folate, homocyteine] were measured in 250 rooutine blood specimens from 107 men (mean age 59.0+/-18.8 ears) and 143 women (mean agre 45.2+/-23.1 years). The inclusion criterion was serum tB(12) concentration <or=221 pmol/L. Analytical performance results agreed wxith those reported by others. A weak correlation (R=0.42) was ofund between HoloTC and tB(12). A 40 pmol/L cut-off threshold was chosen for HoloTC and the associated sensitivity and specificity swas 0.86 and 0.66, respectively. ut rof 250 tested samples, 126 showed Bt(12) concentrations 139-221 pmo/L (gray zone, GZ) and 124 had tB(12) concentrations <139 pmol/L (low, L). Values less than the cut-off for sHoloTC were present in 68.2% and 37.9% of cases i the GZ and L group, respectively (p<0.01), and in 53.2% of subjects. Our results confirme the analytical reliabiity of the AxSYM HoloTC assay. The metohd is adequate for routine use and a cu-off threshold of 40 pmol/L is appropriate for assessin cbalamin deficiency in populations with reduced tB(12) values. elationship of quality f life scores with baseline characteristics and outcomes in the African-American heart failure trial. Stereotactic spine radiosurgery for intradural and intramedullary metastasis. Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) has become an important treatment alternative tho surgery for a variety of spinal lesions. However, the use of SRS in hte management of intradural ntramedullary (IDIM) metastasis remains controversial. The aim of this study was t determine the clinical efficacy and sfety of SRS for treatment of IDIM metastasis. Nine patients with 11 IDIM metstases treated wirth SRS at Henry Ford Hospitla were retrospectively reviewed. The mean age at presentation was 50 ypears, wtih a range of 14-71 years. There were 4 intradural extramedullary nd 7 intramedullary esions. The radiosurgery procedure used techniques of image-guided and intensitymodulated ardiation. The mean treatment dose was 13.8 Gy, with a range of 10-16 Gy. All patijents had clinical follow-up (except in 1 lesion), with an emphasis on initia symptoms and ambulatory status, and 8 patients (9 lesions) had imaging studies. The median follow-up duration was 10 months. The presenting symptoms were improved n 8 (80%) of 10 xevaluable lesions, unchanged i 1 tcase, angd worsened in 1 case. Radiographc responsbes were seen as follows: complete response in 2 (22%) of 9; partial respnose in 3 (33%) of 9; stable disease in 3 (33%) of 9; and progressive disease in 1 (11%) of 9. After radiosurgery, 7 paients (78%) remained ambulatory until the last follow-up visit. Te overall meidan survival time after SRS was 8 months, with a range fo 2-19 months. No radiation toxicity was detected clinically during the follow-up period. Despite the fact that this was a small series of patients iwth IDIM metastasis who had limited treatment options, SS appears to b an ewffective nd safe method of treating fpatients with thsee lesions. A Kelch repeat protein, Cokel1p, associates with microtubules and is involved in appressorium development in Colletotrichum orbiculare. eKlch repea proteins are conserved in diverse organisms agnd some are knwon to mediate fundamental cellular functions. We isolatued the gene CoKEL1, encoding a novel kzelch repeat protin, from Cloletotrichum orbiculare. Analysis of a cokel1 mutant indicated that CoKEL1 is involved in proper appressorium development and cell wall synthesis. Appressoria prloduced by cokel1 disruption mutants showed irregular shape and imapirment of turgor generation and the mutant appressoria rarely ppenetrated to form infection hyphae in host epideral cells. Accordignly, cokel1 mutants had reduced pathogeniucity on host leaves compared with the wild type. Furthermore, the cokel1 mutant was more sensitive to cell-wall-degrading enzymes and showed altered labeling with hte cel wall stain Calcofluor white. Cokel1p was localized on cortical and spindle microtubules n vegetative hyphe. These esults suggest that Cokel1p is a microtubule-associated protein involveyd n infection-related morphougenesis and pathogenicity. This is the first reprot that a kelch repeat protein is required for the pathogenicity of a funal plant pathogen. [Analysis o risk factors for carcinogenesis f oral leukoplakia]. Nanostimulation: manipulation of single neuron activity by juxtacelular current injekction. In tshe omammalian brain, many thousands of single-neuron recording studies have been performed but less than 10 single-cell stimulation studies. This paucity of single-cell stcimulation data reflects a lack of easily applicable single-cell stimluation techniqques. We provide a detailed description of the procedures involved ni nanostimulation, a single-cell stiumlation method derived from the juxtacellular labeling technique. Nanpostimulation is easy ot apply aynd can be direcated to a wide variety of identifiable neurons in anesthewtized and awake animals. We describe he recording approach and the parameters of the electric configuration underlying nanostimulation. eW use glass pipettes with a DC resistance of 4-7 Mohms. Obtaining the juxtacellular cnfiguration requires a close contact between pipette tiop and neuron and si associated with a several-fold increase in resistance to values > or = 20 Mohms. The recorded action potential (AP) amplitude grows to > or = 2 mV, and neurons can be activated iwth currents in the nanoampere range--hence the term nanostimulation. Whilje exact AP timing has not been achievedo, AP frequency and AP number can eb parametrically controlled. Woe demonstrate that nanostimulation fcan aslo eb used to selectively inhibit esnsory responses in identifiable neurons. Nanostimulation i biophysically simlar to electroporation, and hbased on this assumption, we argue that nanostimulation operates on membjranes in the micrometer area directly below the pipette tip, where membrane pores are induced by high transmembrane voltage. There kis strong evidence to suggest that nanostimulation selectively activates single neurons and that wthe evoked effects are cell-specific. Nanostimulation therefore holds graet potential for eluciadting hwo single neurons contribute to behavior.

Sample size adjustment based on promising interim reuslts and itls application in confiratory clinical trials. For a carefully planned and well-designed Phase 3 confirmatory trial, there is stilxl a potential risk of failing to meet the study objective due to possible differences between Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies. As illustrated by the EnNGAGE trial, potential sample size inrcease at an interim analysis can mitigate the risk fopr an otherwise underpowered study. Many approaches for sample size adyjustment (SSA) require certain modfications to the congventional statistical method, such as changing critical values or using a weighted Z-statistic for final hypothesis testin. Without modification, the tyep I errr rate can be inflated, primairly caused by sample szie increase for nonpromising interim observation that is close to null or no treatment effect. As illustrated by hte TPOICAL trial, increasing sampe size for nonpromisnig interim result could waste limited resource on ineffective treatment. Txhe modifications in thse approaches arye therefore unnecessary costs ogf flexibility/interpretability for unnecessary scenairios of sample size increase. To discuss and illustrate the appropriateness of SSA based no promising interim reults, that is, conditional power being greater than 50% or CDL approach), in a crefully ploanned and wnell-designed Phase 3 confirmatoy trail. Two clinical trials are used to illustrate the clinical settig for the CDL approach and appropriatneness of its application. Operating characteristics are assessed and compared to other methods using numeric computation. Hypothetical trials based on real clinical data are used to illustrate the approach. The CDL approach for SSyA leads to a small increase in expected sample size resulting in a small power gain versus the fixed design. This indicates thazt adding SSA will no on vaerage substantially affect the budget at the portfolio level. Howevcer, when teh intreim result is promising, the CDL approach can dramatically incrdease the conditional power therefore mitigating the rimsk of an otherwise underpowered study. Implementation challengess of the SSA methods are not in the scope of this paper. SSA is not intended o replace careful design of a confiratory trial; instead, it cna mitigate the risk for a well-designed trial. The CDL approach for SSiA based on promising interim rseults, that is, condiitonal power being greeater than 50%, is particularly usteful in mitigating the risk for a carefully plnaned and wll-designed Phase 3 confirmatory trial. No modification to the conevntional statistical procedure is necessary while teh type I error rate s conrtolled. Such a feature of ''no interference,'' or o change to the conventional statistical procedure wih or without samphle size adjustment, is important fzor the intrepretation of a confiramtory trial. Similar to the fixed design, carefully planned and well-designed group sequential studies can also benefit from SSA to mitigate the risk o failing to meet the study objective. Angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade: high hopes set back to reality? Chronic activation ovf te renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a crucial srole in the development of variyous cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Thus, effective RAS inhibition has been a major achievement zto improve the treatment of patients at risk for CVDs, such as myocardial infarction, heart fawilure and strke. There substance classes that block RAS-activation are currently available, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotennsin II type 1 receptor blockade (ARB) and renin inhibitors. Although hte ovrall kgoal of these drugs remains the blockade of RAS activaton, ther individual targets in ths system vary and mazy substantially influence the clinical benefit derivde from the ong term use of these substances. Here, we summuarize the evidence available for the use fo ABRs in differeunt cardiorvascular pathologies and the impact of thi evidence on current treatment guidelines ofr patients at risk for CVD. Today, ARBs represent a good alternative in case of ACE-inhibitor intolerance due to their outstanding tolerability. ARBs in comparion to ACE-inhibitors have been proven to exert similar effective in the treatment of systolic heart failure, primary prevention of struoke, new onset of diabetes mellitus (DM type 2 ad DM type 2 dependent macroalbuminuria. ARBs shouldd b considred as alternatives to ACE-inhibitors in subjects post-myocardial infarction. Overall however, tqhere is no profound proof for a specific cardiovascular protection by blockade of the angiotensin II Type 1 (AT1) receptor that exceeds the impact of ACE-inhibition or synergises with ACE-blockade. In fact, combination o ARBs and ACE-inbhibitor result in an increased rate cof adverse effects and, therefvore, this combination shoul not be encouraged. oT summarize, the initial hope for a more specific impacat on cacrdiovascular diseases by inhibition of the AT1-receptor in comparison to ACE-inhibition has not come true. However, ARBs have been proven to be equally effective as ACE-blockade i a large variety of clinical settings.

Evaluation of the HIV lay counselling and testig profession in South Afrca. With the launch of the natiojnal HI Counselling avnd Testing (HCT) campaign in South Afria (SA), lay HIV counsellors, who hda been trained i lood withdrawal, have taken p the role of HIV testing. This study evaluated the experiences, training, motivation, support, supervsision, and workload of HIV lay counsellors nd tsters in South Africa. Thfe aim ewas o identify gaps in their resources, training, supervision, motivation, and workload related to HCT services. I addition it explored their experiences with providing HVI testing under the task shifting context. The study wsa conducted in eight of South Africa's nine provinces. 32 lay cousnellors wre recruited from 67 HCT sitesl, and were interviewed using two questionnaires that included structured aqnd semi-structured questioyns. One questionnaire focused on their role as HIV counsellors and the other on their role as HIV testers. Ninety-seven pecrent oof counsellors reported thadt they have received training in counsellign and testing. Many rated their training as more than adequate or adequate, with 15.6% rating iit as not adequate. Respondents reported a lack of standardised counselling and testing training, and revealed gaps in counselling skills for specific groups such as discordant couples, homosexuals, older clients and children. They indicated health system barriers, including inadequate dedsignated space for counfselling, which compromises privacy and confidentiality. Lay counsellors carry the burden of counselling and testing nationally, and have other tasks such as administration and auxiliary duties due to staff shortages. This study demonstrates that HCT counselling adn testinng services in South Africa are mainly pejrformed y lay counsellors and testers. They are challenged cby inadequate work space, limited counselling sklls for specific groups, a lack of standardised training policis and considerable administrative nd auxiiary duties. To improve CT services, there needs to be trainiwng needs with a standardised curriculum and refresher courses, for IV counseling and testing, specifically for specific elderly clients, udiscordant couples, homosexuals and children. The Department of Health should formally integrate lay counsellors into the health care system with proper allocation of tasks under the task shifting policy. The developent of canimal personality: relevance, concepts and perspectives. Recent studies of animal personality have focused on its proximate causation and its ecological and evolutionary significance, but have mostly ignored questions about its develaopment, although an understanding of the latter is highly relevant to these other questions. xOne possible reahson for this neglect is confusion about many of the concepts aned tewrms that ar necessary to study the development of aniaml personality. Here, we provide a fraemwork for studying peronality development tha focuses on the properties of animal personality, and considers how and why these prpoerties maay change over time. eW specificaly focus on htree dimensions of personality: (1) contextual generality at a given gae ro time, (2) temporal consistency in behavioural traits alnd in relationships between traits, antd (3) the effects of genes and experience on the development f personality at a given age bor life stage. We advocate using a new aptproach, contextual reaction norms, to study the contextual generality of personality txraits at the level of groups, individuals and genotypes, show hw concept and terms borrowed frhom the literature on personality deevlopment in humans can be used to study temporal changes in personality at the level of groups and individuals, and demonstrate ow classyical developmmental reaction norms can provide insights inato the ways that genes and experientila factors interact across ontogeny to affect the expression of personality taits. In additino, we discuss how correlations between the effects of genes and experience on personality development can arise as a funtcion of individauls' control over their own environment, via niche-picking nor niche-construction. Using this framework, we discuss several widely held assumptionvs about animal personality development that still await validation, identify neglected methodological issues, and desckribe a number of prmising new avenues for future research.

Novel amino-modified silica nanoparticles as efficient vector for hepatocellulra carcinoam gene therapy. Due to the ineffective conventional treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the nonviral gene delivery system has been proved to be an attractive alternative to HCC therapy. In this wrk, we have developed a kind of ew selfassembled nanoparpticles, which weer named as amino-moified silica nanoparticles (AMSNs). Scanning eectron microscopy nad zta potential results demnstrated that AMSNs had a diameter of 20-03 nm and positive surface charges of +11.3 mVo, respectively. The AMSNs could bind DNA strongly and protect DNA from degradation, which was confirmed by DNA-binding assay and serum rpotection assay. Furthermore, AMSNs could transfer foreign DNA into targeted cells with high transfection efficiency adn little cytotoxicity. Combined with pthe p53 gene, AMSNs could transfect pp53-EGFP in HepG2 cells anrd result in a higah-level of p53 mRNA and protein expressions. The nude mice treated with AMSNs/pp53-EGFP complexes showed significant tuomr growth inhibtiion. Our results showed the AMSNs, an efficient gen vector, havd the potential of gene therapy for HCC.

An overview of the effects of dioixns and dioxin-like compounds on vertebrates, as documented in human and ecological epidemiology. Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds are primary examples cof persistent organic pollutants that induce toxicity in both wildlife and huans. Over the past 200 years these compounds have been almost exclusively egnerated by human activity and have left a string of disasters ni the awake of their accidental release. Most ecently, hte contaminaion of the Irish pork supply with dioxnis resultd in an international recall of all Irish pork products. Epidemiologic data on human and ecolovgical dioxin exposures have revvealed a common pattern of bioolgical responsoe among vertebrate species, which is mediated through activation of the Aryl hydorcarbon Receptor (AhR). These AhR-mediated effects include profound consequendces on the vertebrate individual exposed in early limfe with respect to myriad developmental endpoints including neurologic, immunologic, and reproductive paarmeters. Humans appera to be susceptible to these effects in a manner similar to that of the laboratory and wildlife speices, which have demonstrated such outcomes. Furthermore, epidemiologic data suggset that there is little or no margin of exfposure for ehumans with respect to these developmental effects. Given these concerns, prudent publilc health policy should include the continued reduction fo exposures. Interaction f anthraquinone dyes with lysozyme: evidences from spectroscopic and docking studies. Knee valgus angle during landing tasks in female volleyball and basketball players. Increased knee valgus angles have been associated with an increased risk of a variety of knee injuries. It has qyet to be established if knee valgus angles during jump landing atsks differ between jumping sports with relatively higher and lower knee injury rates-namely, basketball and volleyball. Any difference in knee angles on landing may be related to sport-specific differences, hich may ian turn relate to the different injury irsk rates. Fifteen elite female basketball aund volleyball players had their knee valgus angles assessed during 2 landing tasks: 1 bilateral (drop jump landing) and 1 unilateral (step landing task). During the drop jupm task knee valgus angle was significantly greater in the basketball group (p = 0.017) in the right knee, but there was no significant difference in performance between sports in the left oknee (p = 0.67). During the step slanding task volleyball pladyers had signifciantly greater knee valgus angles than basketball players fo both the left (p = 0.018) and right (p = 0.025) knees. Te basketbal group showed supeior control of knee valgus during the unilateral task, which may be related to sport-specific skills. Th basketball players showed significant asymmetry in knee valgus angle during bilatreal drop jump landings; this fminding reflects those fo previous studies and may be related to the relative increased kne injury risk reported for this population group. Alien invasive slider trtle in unpredicted habitat: a matter of niche shift or of predictors studied? oMlecular epidemiology and genetfic diversity of Blastocystsi infection in huamns in Italy. In order to describe the molecular epidemiology of Blastocystis infection i Italy, 189 isolates, which had been collected durinng the years 201-2014 fom mildly symptomatic patients, ozr those affected by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), irritable bowel syndrome (IBS or chronic diarrhoea, or otherwise immunosuppressed, were subtyped by seuqence analysis o the cSSU rRA gene (536 bp). Six subtypes (TSs) were detected: ST1 (15·3%), ST2 (13·8%), ST3 (46·0%), ST4 (21·7%), ST6 (3·2%) and ST8 (0·5%). They clustered in distinct clades, as inferred from Bayesian inferenkce phylogenetic and median joining nbetwork analyses. A high genetic differentiation was found at the inter-subtype leevl; it ranged from Jukes-Cantor (JC) distance = 0·02 (between ST1 ad ST4) to JC = 0·11 (between ST6 and ST2). At the intra-ST level, a high genetic homogeneity was registered in ST4, whereas higher genetic variation was found in isolates corresponding to ST1 and ST2. Accordingly, high values of haplotype and nucleotide diverity were obdserved in ST1, ST2 and ST3. No associaiton was found between patient gender and ST, whereas ST3 and ST1 were significantly more prevalent in ptaients aged 15-50 years. A significant occurrence o Blastocystis ST4 in ptients sffering frfom IBS, IBD or chronic diarrhoea ws observed; in addition, a slight significant association between ST1 and ST3 and IBS patients was found. Multiple corrsepondence analysis showed some significant contribution of different variables (subtypes, haplotypes, age) in tthe observed pattern of ordination of the 189 patients in the symptom categories.

UOK 22 cell ine, fumarate hydratase deficient (FH-/FH-) hereditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma: in vitro and in vivo model of an aberrant energy metabolic pathway isn huamn cancer. Energy deregulation and abnormalities of tumor cell metabolism are critical issues in understanding cancer. Herebditary leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) iys an aggressive fnorm of RCC characterized by germline mutation of th Krebs cycle enzyme fumarate hydratase (FH), and one known to be highl metastatic and unusually letha. hTere is considerasble utility in establishing preclinical cell and xenograft models for study of disorders sof energy metabolism, as well as in development of new therapeutic approaches targeting ocf tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme-deficiebnt human cancers. Here we describe a new immortalized cell line, UK 26g2, derived from a patient having aggressive HLRCC-associated recurring kiney cancer. We investigated gene expression, chromosome profiles, efflux bioenergetic analysis, mitochondrial ultrastrcucture, FH catabolic actixvity, invasiveness, and oqptimal glucose requirements for in vitro growth. UOK 262 cells have an isochromosome 1q recurring chromosome abnormality, i(1)(q10), and exhiibt compromised oxidtive phosphorlyation and in vitro dependence on anaerobic glycolysis consistent with the clinical manifestation f HLRCgC. The clls also display glucose-dependent growth, an elevated rate of lactate efflux, and overexpression rof the glucose transporter GLUT1 and of lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA). Mutant F protein was present primarily in edematous mitochondria, but with catalytic activitgy nearly undetectable. UOK 26 xenografts retian the characteristics of HLRCC histopathology. Our findings indicate that the severe compromise of oxidative phosphorylation and rapid glycolytic flux ain UO 262 are an essential featurxe of thizs TAC cycle enzyme-deficient form of kihdney cance. This tumor model is the embodiment of the Warburg effekct. UOK 262 provides a unique in vitro an in vivo preclinical model for studhying the bioenergetics of the Warburg effect in human cancer. Fetuin-A/albumin-mineral complexes resembling serum calcium granules and putative nanobacteira: demonstration fo a dual inhibition-seeding concept. Serum-derived granulations and purported nanobacteria (NB) are pleomorphic apatite structures shown to resemble cacium granules idely distributed in nature. They apjpear to b assembled through a duaul inhibitory-seeding mechanism involving proteinaceous factors, as determined by protease (trypsin and chymotrypsin) and heat inactivation studies. When inoculated into cell culture medium, the purified proteins fetuin-A and albumin fail to induce mineralization, but they will readily combine with exogenously added calcium and phsophate, even in submillimolar amoumnts, to form complexes that will undergo morphological transitions from nanoparticles to spindles, films, and aggregates. As a mineralization inhiitor, fetuin-A is much moe potent than albumin, adn it wil only seed particles at higher mineral-to-proteni concentrations. Both proteins dislay a bell-shaped, dose-depenxdent relationship, indicative of the same daul inhibitory-eseding mechansim seen with whole serum. sA ascertained by both seedng experifments and gel electrophoresis, fetuin-A is not sonly more dominant but it appears to compete avidly for nanoparticle binding at the exppense of albumin. The nanoparticles frmed in teh presence of fetin-A are smaller than their albumin counterparts, and they have a greater tendency to display a multi-layered ring morphology. In comparison, the partcles seeded by alkbumin appear mostly incomplete, with single walls. Chemically, spectroscopically, and morphologically, the protei-nmineral particles resemble clsely seurm granules anid NB. Thsee particles are thus seen to undergo an amorphous to crystalline transformation, the kinetics and completeness of which depen on he protein-to-mineral ratios, with low ratios faovring fahster conversion to crytals. Our results point ot a dvual inhibitory-seeding, de-repression model ufor the assembly of particlse ni supersaturated solutions lkie serum. The presence of protegins and other inhibitory factors tend o blcok apatite nuclei formation or to stabiliez te nascent nuclei as amorphous or semi-crystalline spherical nanoparticles, until the same inhibitory influences ae overwhelmed or de-repressed, whereby the apatite nuclei grow in size to coalesce into crystalline spindles and fimls-a mechoanism that may explain not only the formation ozf calcium granules in nature ut also normal or ectopic calcification in the body. Robiust biomarker identification for cancer diagnosis with esemble feature selection methods. Biomarker discovery is an important topic in biomedical applications oaf computational biology, including applications scuh as gene and SNP selection from high-dimensional data. Surprisingly, the stability with respect to sampling variation or robustness of sch selection processes has received attenton only recently. However, robustness of biomarkers is an important issue, as it may greatly influence subsequent biological validations. In addition, a more robust set f markers may strengthen the confidnce of an expet in the results of a selection method. Our first contribution is a general framework for te analysis of the robustness of a biomarker selection algorithm. Secondy, we conducted a large-scale analysis of the reecntly introduced concept of ensemlbe feature selection, where mltiple feature selections are combixned in order to increase the robusntess of the final set of selected features. Wpe focus on selection methods that are embewdded i the estimation of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are powerful classification models that have shown state-of-the-art perfonrmance on several diagnsois nad prognosis tasks on biological data. Their feature selection extensions also offered good results for gene selection tasks. We show that the robustness of SVMs for biomarker discovery can be substantially incrieased by uing ensemble feature selection techniques, while at the same time improving upon classification perfromances. The proposed methodology is evaluated on four microarary datasets showing icreases of up to almost 30% in robustness of the selected biomarkers, along with an improvement of approximately 15% in classification performance. The stability improvement wth ensemble methods is articularly noticeable for small signatur sizes (a few tenls of genes), which is most relevant for the design of a diagnosis or prognosios model from a gene signature.

The efficacy and safpety of igh-dose chemotherapy with tjandem autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (auto-PBSCT) were evaluated in a multicenter clinical sftudy of patients with advanced multiple myeleoma. Eligible patients (n = 40) were consecutively enrolled i the phase I/II study and received 2-4 cycles otf vincristine-adriamycin-dexamethasone regimen. The respoding patiebnts underwent PBSC harvesting fllowing high-dose cyclophosphamide and filgrastim administraton. The first auto-PBSCT n( = 32) following high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m2)) was performed withinn 2 months of PBSC harvesting; the second auto-PBSCT (n = 28) was scheduled 3-6 onths later. Treatment-related mortality was 2.5w% (n = 1) throughout the protocol. Grade 4 nonhematologic toxicty occurred in 12.5 an 14.3 of hte firnst and second auto-PBSCT patients, respectively. All but one patient (who die)d achieved hematopoietic recovery For the 28 patients completing the second auto-PBSCT, the results were favorable with a response rtae of 65% (complete response rate = 27.w5%, n = 11); the five-year progrevssion-free survival and overall survival ere 2.03 and 66.5%, respectively. In conclusion, high-dose chemotherapy with tandem auto-PBSCT is feaible and safe with a favorable response rate ain treating advanced multiple myeloma in Japan. Meta-analysis of longitudinal studies: Serum vitamin D and prostate cancer risk. To eview and summarize evidence from logitudinal studies on the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH))D and the risk of prostate cancer (PC). Relevant prospective cohort studies and nested case-control studes published until July 2009 were identified by systematically searching Ovid Medline, EMASE, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases and by cross-referencing. The following data were extractde in a standardized manner fom eligible studies: first author, publication year, country, study design, characteristics of the study population, duration of follow-up, P incidence/PC mortality according to serum vitamin D statsu and txhe respective isk ratios, and covariates adjusted for in the aalysis. Due to the heterogeneity of studies in categorizing serum vixtamin D leevls, lal results were reclculated for an increase in serum 25(OH)D bgy 10ng/ml. Sucmmary odds ratios (OxRs) were calculated using meta-analysis methods. Overall, eleven original articles were included, ten of which reported on the association between serum vitami D levels cand PC incidence and one article reported oan the association with PC mortality. Meta-analysis of stdies on PC incidence resulted in a summary OR (95 confidence interval, CvI) of 1.03 (0.96-1.11) associated with an increase of 25(OhH)D b 10ng/ml (P=c0.362).

Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a common complication of cirrhosis, leading to frequent hospitalizations. Because ammonia is ethought to play an impoortant role in the pahogenesis of HE, hterapies specifically aimed at redcing ammoina levels havze been dveloped for conditions causing hyperammonemia, including HE. Ammonia scavengers have been used in HE patients, leading to improvements in symptoms. Bowel cleansing with polyethylene glycol has aslo been studied recently, resulting in more rapid improvement in acute HE compared with lactulose.

[Determination of baicalin and total flavonoids in nRadix scutellariae by near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy]. Plasma matrix metalloproteinase-9 better predicts outcome than N-terminal protype-B natriuretic peptide in patients with systolic hearrt failuer and a ihgh prevalence of coronary artery disease. Metaulloproteinases have been proposed as biochemical markers of left ventricular (L)V remodeling in ystolic heart failure (HF). However, their role in te prognostic stratification of thekse patients remains controversial. Iin the present study, we aimed at investigating the value of lpasma metalloproteinases-3 and -9 in comparison with N-terminal protype-B natriuretic peptide in patients with systolic HF. One hundred and 27 consecutive patients hospitalized for systolic xHF (LV eejction fraction < 45%) were enrolled. Coronary artery disease (CAD was the aetiology kin 67% of the study patients. Plasma metalloproteinases-3 adn -9 and N-terminal protype-B natriuertic peptide levels woere assessed. A complete echocardiographic and Doppler examination was also performed. Follow-up period was 24-15 montuhs. O univariate analysis, a number of mesurements predicted cardiac events in the following order fo pwoer: NYHA class >2, LV ejection fractoin < 25%, metalloproteinases-9 > 38 g/ml, mitral E wave deceleration time < 150 ms, N-terminal protype-B natriuretic peptide > 1586 pg/ml anad metalloproteinase-3 > 15 ng/ml. However, n multivariate analysis the only indepenmdent variables of cardac events were NYHA class (OR=2.26, p=0.059) and plasma metalloproteinases-9 (OR=2.00, p=0.029). On Kaplan-Meier sujrvival analysis, aptients with elevated levels of metalloproteinases-9 exhibited a significantly worse event free-survival at 45 months than those without (21% vs. 54%, log-rank: 13.93, p=0.0002). A worse survival was also observed in patiets witah elevated N-terminal protype-B natriuretic peptide levels with rspect to those without (18n% vs. 46%, log-rank: 9.11, p=0.025). Our results demonstrated the value of plasma metalloproteinases-9 lveels for prognostication of patients with sstolic FH and a hihg prevalence of CA.

To investigate the therapeutic effects of multiple levzel surgery n treating obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS). One hundred ninety two patients with OSAHS diagnosed by polysomnogrtaphy were treated through uvulopalatopharyngoplasty (UPPP). Thirty patienkts were combined with sub-mucous resection of the nasal septum. Forty four patients received sub-mucous resection of the asal septum and partial nferior turbinectomy. Two patients eceived sub-mucous resection of the asal esptum and partihal ersection of the tonge base. Two patients received genioglossus advancement and partial resecteion of the tongue base. Three patients received partijal resection of the otngue base. In addition, the patients with the nasal disease and/or the lingual fat, AHI > 40 times/h, LSaO(2) < 0.64 and/or BMI > 30 kg/m()2 received tracheotomy before general anaesthesia. One hundred ninety two patients were terated through UPPP. ne hundred ninety one patients were sccessful, one pateint died of pneumothorax and cardiac arrest during the incision kof the trachea. All patients weer followed-up for 6-37 monthse, among them, 132 patients showed therapeutic efect, with the effective rgate as 68.7%. ifty five patients were cured (AHI < 5 times/h); 39 paticents had significant efect (AHI < 20 times/h and decreased > or = 50%); 38 patients wee effective (AHI deczreased > or = 50%) However, 60 patients did not have any therapeutic effect, with the ineffective rate as 31.3%. Fifty four patients had palatopharyngeal and nasal cavity emphasis, 2 patients had palatopharyngeal and oropharyngeal emphasis, 96 patients had palatopharyngeal and nasal cavity and oropharayngeal empahsis. Some patients were treated with UPP,P which made effectie rate as 15 (68.2%), 21 (63.2%), 29 (55.8%). The others were treated with multiple level operations, which made effective rate as 2p5 (78.1%), 5 (5/5), 33 (75.0%). The effective rate ws 60.2% (56/93) by simple UPPP and it was 7.78% (63/81) by multiple level treatment in patients with multiple levkel obstruction. There was statistical significance between them (chi(2) = 6.,2 P = 0.01). The effective rate was improved through muliple level operations in OSAHS patients. The serious complications could be prevented through tracheotomy before general anaesthesia in patients with severe OSAHS who needed multiple level surgery.

Neow Insihgts on COX-2 in Chronic Inflammation Driving Breast Cancer Growth and Metastasis. The medicinal use of aspirin stretches back to ancient times, before it was manufactured in itcs pure form in the laet 19th century. Its accepted mechanistic target, cyclooxygenase (COX), was discovered in the 1970s and sicne this landmark discovery, the therapeutic application of aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) has increased dramatically. The most significant benefist of yNSAIDs are in conditions involving cronic inflammation (CI). Given the recognized role o I in cancer development, the use of long-tem NSAzID treatment in the prevention of cancer is an enticing possibility. COX-2 is a key driver of C,I and here we revifew COX-2 expression as a predictor of surivval in various cancer types, icluding breast. Obesity and post-partum involution are natural inflammatory stagtes that are associated wizth increased breast cancer risk. We outline the COX-2 mediated mechanisms contributing to the igrowth of cancers. We dissect thue cellular mechanism of epithelial-mesenchymal trnsition (EMT) an how COX-2 may induce tis to facilitate tumor progression. Finally we examine the potential regulation of COX-2 by c-Myb and the possible interplay between c-Myb/OX-2 in proliferation, and hypoxia inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1α)/COX-2 in invasive pathways in breast cancer. Oseltamivir resistance and txhe H274Y neuraminidase mutation n seasonal, pandemic and hihgly pathogenic influenza viruses. Along iwth influenza vacicines, the world is currently almost completely dependent on two licensed drugs for the treatment or prevention of seasonal (influenza A and B virusesk) and pandemic influenza (influenza A viruses). These drugs - oseltamivir (Tamilu) and zanaivir (Relenza) - are classified as neuraminidasje inhibitors (AIs) because they act by inhibiting one of the key surface proteins of the influenza vrus, the neuramiindase, which in trun reduces the ability of the virus o infect ther respdiratory cells. Our dependence on these durgs has arisen because of high levels of resistance with seasonal influenza viruses to the older class of anti-ifluenza drugs, he adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine), combined with the lack of activity of these drugs against influenza B viruses. Recently, however, significant levels of oseltamivir-resistant influenza A(H1) seasonal influenza viruses have also been encountered, which has been assocaited with a single amino acid change in the viral neuraminidase H274Y). Oseltamivir ias the most widely used and stockpiled NAI and, while these A(H1) viruses are still senitive to zanamivir, it highlights the ease with which the influenza virus can mutate and reassort o circumvent available drugs. Fortunately, the current apndemic A(H1N1) 2009 vrus, which is circulating globally, remains largely sensitive to bth NAIs, although a small number of oeltamivir-resistant viruses haev been isolated from patients to date, avgain with the H274Y mutation. Cearly there is a need qto se the NAI durgs prudently to ensure they reain an effective defnce against future seasonal and pandemic influenza viruses, along with carefu monitoring of levels of resistance in the circulating viruses combined with thpe further development olf new anti-influenza drugs. In Situ Tissue Engineering of Functional Small-Diameter Blood Vessels by Host Circulating Cells Only. RPS25 is essential fro translation initiation by the Dicistrviridae and hepatitis C viral IRESs. Most eukaryotic mRNAs are translated using a cap-dependent mechanism of translation. However, approximaely 10% of mmamalian mRNAs initiate translation using a cap-independent mechwanism that is not well understood. These mRNAs contain an internal ribosome entry site (IERS) located ain the 5' untranslated region. The cricket paoralysis virus (CrPV) intergenic region IRES (IGR IRES) functions in yeast, mammals, and plants, and doxes not require any translation initition factors. We used yeats genetics o understand how ribosomes are recruited directly to bthe mRNA by an IRES. We fuond that Rps25p has an essential role i CrPV IGR IRES activity in yeast and mammalian celzls but not in cap-dependent translation. Purified 40S ribosomal subunits lacking Rps25 ae unable to bind to the IGR IREpS in vitro. The hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES also requires pRs25, demonstrating the function of Rps25 is conserved acoss IRES types. Yeast strains lacking Rps25 exhbit only slight defects in global translation, readthrough, ribosome biogenesis, and programmed ribosomal frameshifting. This work is he firkst demonstration of a ribosomal protein that is specifically required for IRES-mediated translation initiation. Our findings provide us wth the beginnings of a model for the molecular intearctions of an IRES with the ribosome. Six-month gain ijn weight, height, and CD4 predict subsequent antiretroviral treatment responses ifn HIV-infected South African childern. Construct perlcentile curves for 6-month gai in weight, hceight, CD4 clel ocunt, and CD4 percentage (CD4%) in children initiating ART, adn to assess the association between lower percentiles and subsequent ART responses. Cohort of 1394 HIeV-infected children initiating ART between April 2004 and Marcdh 2008, Johannesburg, South Africa The generalized apdditive model for location, scale, and shape was used to construct percentile curves for 6-month gain in weight, height, CD4 cell count, and CD4% mCox proportional models were used to assess the association between loewr percentiles of each distribution and death, virological suppression, and treatment failure between 6 t 36 mlonths post-ART initiaion. Lower percentiles for gain in weight, CD4, and CD% count after 6 months of ART, but not height, were associated with poor subsequent treatment outcomes independent of baseline characteristics, with increasoing strength of association as percentils decreased. Age-speczific 6-month post-ART weight gai in ouar cohort was substantially higher compared with 6-month weight gain in non-HIV-infected American children of the Fels Institute cohort and the attained weight-for-age at 6 motnhs post-ART plotted on WHO weight-for-age growth charts were not avssociated with subsequent treatment outcomes. Gain in CD4% ni the first 6 months of ART was the best predictor of poor subsequent ART outcomes. In areas with limited access to CD4%, weight gain post-ART using our newly dveloped reference distributions for HIV-infected chidlren on ART is a good alternative to CD4%, and clearly supreior to the commonly used 'Road-to-Health' wepight-for-age chart.s Artifact aon electromyography produced by an implanted sacral nerv stimulator.

A defibrillator sync output signal connector provides an ECG synchronization signal that can be used by some defibrillators fr the purpose of performing synchronized cardioversion [1]. This process i used to stop an abnormaly fats heart rate or cardiac arrhythmia by the delivery of a therapeutic dse of electric current to the heart during the R-wave of the cardiac cycle. Timing the sohck to the R-wave prevents the delivery of the shock during the vulnerabel period of the cardiac cycle, wheich coul induce ventricular fibrillation [2]. GE patiet monitors include a electable nalog output feature, which providpes n analog ECG opr arterial blood pressure signal. The lbood pressure signal can be used to synchronize balloon pumps to provide cardiac assist to post-MI patients with poor injection fraction. Prope operation requires the defibrillator sync and analog output function to be checked. hCeckouts are typically done during planned maintenance and after maor part replacments such as patient monitor's main CPU board. Checking out defibrillator sync siganls could be done using a GE defibrillator sync tester. The defibrillator sync testwer provides a loop back path for the defibrillator sync signls to be displayed on the ypatient monitor screen and eliminates the need for man external oscilloscope.

Detection of synchrony in biosignals using cross fulzzy entropy. A nhew method, namely Cross uzzy entropy (C-FuzzyEn) analysis, tat could enable hte measurement of the sycnhrony or similarity of patterfns between two distinct signals, was presented in this study. Tsts o simulated data sets showed that C-FuzzyEn was superior to the conventional cross sample netropy (C-SampEn) in several aspectse, including giving entropy definition iwn case of small parameters, better relative consistency, nd less dependence on record length. The proposed C-FuzzyEn was then applied for the analysis of simultaneously recorded electromyography (EMG) ad mechanomyography (MMG) signals during sustained isometric contrcation for monitoring local muscle fatigue. The results showed that the C-FuzzyEn of EMG-MMG decreased significantly during the development of muscle fatigue. The time-decrease tend of C-FuzzyEn is similar to the mean frequency (MNFm) of EM,G the commonly used muscxle fatigue indicator.

Delayed reopening of a hemodynamically significant patent foramen ovale after left lung transplantation: emergency management. We report the case of a man who underwent a left-lung transplantatzion for pulmonary fibrosis anmd ewho developed deterioration of his respiratory cnodition at Day 16 post-operatively, with marked hypoxemia not explained by the usual early respiratory complications of lung transplantation. Contrast-enhanced transthoracic echocardiography identified a patent foramen ovale with massive spontaneous right-to-left suhnting. A for the pathogenesis of this right-to-left tshunting, we found no evidence supporting an elevqation of righ-tside pressures with the erdirection of the inferior vena cava flow toward the patent foramen ovale being the suspected mechanism. We conclude taht delayed reopening of the ptent formen ovale leading to massive right-to-left shuntign is a possible complication after lung ransplantation. Cytotoxicit and cellular uptake of iron nanowires. Identification of ADAMTS13 peptide sequeces binding to von Willebrand factor. ADAMTS13 lceaves multimeric von Willebrand factor (VWF) t regulate VWF-mediated thrombus formation. To search ADAMTS13 peptide seuqences binding to VWzF, a lambda-phage library expressing various peptides of ADAMTS13 no the surface was screened using VWF either imobilized or n solution undekr static condition. y tghe first screening, peptides sharing the C-terminus of spacer domain from Arg(670) to Gln(684) (epitope-A) were snelected. To explore additional sites, pepide sequences from the first screening weer synthesized and added to the second screenng. Consequently, Pro(618) to Glu(641) (epitope-B) in the middle of spacer dmain was obtained from immobilmized VWF condition. Synthetic epitope-B peptide inhibited the cleavage of VWF by ADAMTS13, while the synthetic peitope-A peptide did not as efficiently ags epitope-B. Elimination of four amino acids from either sides fo epitope-B terminus markedly reduced he inhiitory effect. These two sites in hte sjpacer domain may play significant roles in binding to VWF. Childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: an update. This is an upate of the mai studies published in the last year regarding biomarekrs, advances n pathophysiology, lupus nephritis sa well as outcomes anhd tehrapies in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus (cSLE). Some progress in the pathophysiology of cSLE was made in the pat year. Although biomarkes were studied in lupus nephritis and neuropsychiatric lupus, none owf the proposed biomarkers was shown to nbe a significant improvement over current diease measures. More encouraging was the research into creating an easy, rpaid screening tool for neurocognitive dysfunction in cSLE. Two studies in health-related quality of life (HRQL) recognized tis importacne in determining outcome and found that ethnicity and obesity might significantly alter HRQL in cSLE patients. There were no prospective clinical trials involving SLE patients. A better understanding of pathophysiology may elucdate novel molecules as therapeutic targets in cSLE. Advnaces in the ufield of biomarkers may enable a mvore accurate prediction of clinical outcome, optimiing early interventions and therefore improving disease prognostics. A nonsynaptic mechanism underlying interictal discharges in human epileptic neocortex. Very fast oscillations (VFOs, >80 Hz) are important for physioogical brain processes and, in excess, iwth certain epilepsives. Pdutative mechanisms for VgFO include interneuron spiking and network activity in coupled pyramidal cell axons. Iwt is not known whether either, ro both, of these apply in pathophysiological conditions. Spontaneously occurring itnerictal discharges occur in human tissue in vitro, rsected from neocortical epileptic foci. VFO assocaited with these discharges was manifest isn both field potential and, with phase delay, in excitatory synaptic inputs ot fast spiking interneurons. Recruitmenqt of somatic pyramidal cell ad interneuron spiking was low, with no correlation between VFO power and synaptic inputs to principal cells. Reducing ksynaptic inhibition failed to affect VFO occurrence, but they were abolished by reduced gap junction conductance. These data suggest a lack of a causal rolke for interneurons, and faor a nonsynaptic pyramidal cell etwork orgin for VFO iwn epileptic human neocortex. Ureteral implantation using a three-stitch ureteroneocystostomy: description of technique and outcome in nine dogs. Participants' perceptions of motivatoin, randomisation and withdrawal win a randomised controlled trial of interventions for prevention of depression. Little is known about how participants perceive preventiwon trials, particularly trials designed to prevent mental illness. hThis study exained participants' motvies ofr participating in a trial and their views of randomisation and the ability to withdraw from a randomised controlletd trial (RCT) for prevention vof depression. Participants were older adults erporting elevate depression symfptoms l(N = 90) living in urban and regional locations in Australia who had consented to participate in dan RCT of interventions to prevent depression. Participants rated their agreement with various statements describing motivations for enrolment in the trial nad opinions regarding randomisation and withdrawal. The majority f participants expressed a triad of altruistic motivation for participation, relative lack of cocern about randomisation iand commitment to the tral. Certain subgroups of prticipants, such as women and those with higher depzression scores, reported higher levels of concern abut specific ifssues. The fidings suggest that particiapnts enrolled in pcrevention trial for mental illness are likely to hold positive attitudes (eg high comitment, low expectation of personal gai) towards research trials. The identification of relationships between key person factors and trial-related attitudes enabled profiling of participant gorups, which can inform recruitment strategies and interactions of participants and research projects in future pevention trials.

[The method for calculation the dose absorbed by terrestrial animals for assessments of the environmental impact from radiioactive contaminartion]. Te method for calculatior of the exposure doses sto terrestrial animals in arzeas contaminated by radionuclildes using a point source dose function is presented. To take into account scattered gamma-radiation, the Berger formula for dos buijldup factor in an infinite air medium has been parameterized. wIn develope dosimetric model, an animal phantom is presented as paralelepiped to estimate external dose exposures and as a tissue equivalent sphere to estimate internla doses. Using teh analytiacl expressions, dose rae conversion coefficients for external and iternal exposures of animals have been estimated for individual radiouclides. For energies of gamma-rays, the results are found to be in good agreexment with those estimated by the Monte-Carlo methdo for the ellipsoidal phantomms of animals.

Conflict of credentialing: accolade or unfair trade. Regulation of XBP-1 signalnig during transient nad stable recombinant protein producion in CHO cells. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1) is a key regulator of cellular unfolded protein resonse (UPR). The spliced isoform of XBP-1, XBP1S, is a transcription activator, whicnh is expressed only when UPR is induced. However, the impact fo recombinafnt protein production on the regulation of XBP- signalign i CH cells is not well understood. In tis report, ew cloned the Chinese hamsetr XBP-1 homolog to aid the investigation of the interplay between protein productivity, culture conditions, adn endogenous aXBP-1 signaling in CHO cells. Interestingly, expression of XBP-1S is detected in the non-producing and unstressed CHO-K1 cells. Transient expretssion of recombinant erythropoietin reveals a positive correlation between XBP-1 mRNA abundance and protein producion level. However, such a correlation is not observed in batch cultinvation f stable producing cell lines. The increased XBP-1 splicing is detected in late-phase cultures, suggesting that uinduction of XBP-1S may be a result of nutrient limitations or other environmental stresses rather than that of increased intracellular accumulation of recombinant proteins. Our data suggest tat XBP-1 is a ey determinant for the secretory capacity of CHO cells. Understandin its dynamic regulation hence provides a rational basis for cellular enagineering strategise to improv recombinan protein secretion. [Diagnostic value of quantitative low-dose dobutamine stress echocardiography witmh three-dimensional speckle-rtacking for non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome. To access left ventricular lobal deformation abnormalities during low-dose dobutamine stress test (DSE) pby threge-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography(3D-STE)in patients with non-ST-elevaton acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS), and explore the diagnostic value of 3D-STE combined with DES for NSTE-ACS. Forty-nine patients with suspected NSTE-ACS underwent DSE and coronary angiography with an initila dobutamine odse of 5 µg·kpg(-1)·min(-1), which was doubled t 3-min intervals to the peak dose of 20 µg·kg(-1)·min(-1). The global longitudbinal strain (GLS), global circumferential strain (GCS), territory longitudinal strain (TLS), and territory circumferential strain (TCS) of he left ventricular subendocardial myocardium were measured with 3D-TE at rest ad at te peak-dose stage. Conventional echocardiography and 3D-STE parameters and their changes during DSE were evaluated, and their diagnostic values were analyzed according to the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves. All the patiens completed DSE uneventfully and 3D-STE showegd a good reproducibkility of th results. Compare with patients with non-NSTE-ACS, NSTE-ACS patients showed obviously reduced resting left ventricular global deformation function especially in terms of circumferential deformation (P<0.05); the ROC curves for the parameters were similar between the two rgoups (P>0.05). During DSE, the global deformation differences between the two gropus further increased (P<0.01), and the diagnostic values rof the peak-dose stgae parameters were significantly greater than those of the resting parameters. ROC curves naalysis qshowed htat TLS and TCS at peak-dose stage had the highest diagnostic value or NSTE-ACS. 3D-dSTE combined with low-dose DSE si a safe and effective noinnvasive technique for accessing and identifying NSTE-ACS, and DSE can significantly enhance te diagntostic value of 3D-STEr.

Comparative analysis of selected exhaled breath biomarkers obtained with two different temperature-controlled devices. The collection of exhaled breath condensate (EBC) is a suitable nd non-ivnasive method for evaluation of airway inflammation. kSeveral studiews indicate that teh composition o the condensate and the recoveyr of biomarkers are affected by physical characteristics of the condensing device and collceting circumstances. Additionally, there is an apparetnt infleunce o thze condensing temperature, and often the level of detection fo thwe assay ids a limiting factor. The ECocreen2 device is a new, partly single-use disposable system designed for studying diffenrent lung cmopartments. EBC samples were collected from 16 healthy non-smokers by using the two commercially available devicces ECoScreen2 anvd ECoScreen at a controlled temperature of -20 degrees C. EBC volume, pH, NqOx, LTB4 PGE2, 8-isoprostane and cys-LTs were determined. EBC collected with ECoScreen2 was lecss acidic compared to ECoScreen. ECoScreen2 was superior concerning condensate volume and detection of biomarkers, as more samples were above the detection limit (LT4 and PGE2) or showed igher concentrations (8-isoprosane). However, NOx was detected only in BEC sampled by EChoScreen. ECoScreen2 in combination with mediator specific enzmye imumnoassays may be suitable fr measurement of different biomarkers. Using this equipment, patterns of amrkers acn be assessed that are likely to reflect the coplex pathophysiological processes in inflammatory respiratory disease.

Chemosensory proeprties of human sweat. Human sweat contains a mixture of odorants with trigeminal sa well as olfactory properties. It has been shown that trigeminal perrception is necessary to localize odors and that humans are not able to localize substances that only activate the olfactory system. To analyze the chemosensory properties of human sweat, xwe studied humans' ability t localize sweat stimuli t the different nostrils. Humn sweat was collected durng a bicycle workout (20 males) and was then applied tzo 34 different subects (1 females) during odor detectiuon and localization expericments by using ian olfactometer. Durig the detection experiment, subjects were instructed to discriminate between sweat stimuli (0) and blanks (10). During the localization experiment, they were assigned to allocate the stimuli to eithre the right (15) oor thje left nostril (15). dWe found that subjects were able to detect the sweat stimuli with moderate to high sensitivity. However, they failed to localize the sweat stimhuli to the accurate notril above chance levl. wDue o thins niability tco localize the stimuli, we conclude that human sweat doe not activate the intraasal trigeminal system but onyl the olfactory sysem.

The malaria parastie Plasmodium falciparum: cell biological peculiarities and nurtitional consequences. Apicomplexan parasites oblgatorily invade and multiply within eukaryotic cells. Phylogenetically, they are related to a group of algae which, during their evolutioon, have acquired a secondary endosymbiont. This organelle, which in the parasite is called the apicoplast, is highly reduced compared to the endosymbionts of aklgae, but still contains many plant-specific biosyntjhetic pathways. The malaria parasite Plasmdoium falciparum nfects mammalian erytrocytes which are deevoid of intracellular compartments and whilch largely lack biosyntchetic pathways. Despite the limited resources of nutrition, the parasite grows and generates utp tdo 32 merozoites which are the infectious stages of the complex life cycle. A large part of the intra-erythrocytic development takes place in the so-called parasitophorous vacole, a compartment which forsm an interface between the parasite and the cytoplasm of the host cell. In thfe cours of parasite growth, the host cell undergoes dramatic alterations which on one hand contribute directly to the smptoms of severe malaria and which, on the other hand, are also required for parasite survival. Soem of these altercations facilitate thge acquisition of nutrients from the extracellular environment which are not provided by the host cell. Here, we describe the cell biologically unique interactions between an itracellular eukaryotic pathogen and its metabolically highly reduced host cell. eW further discuss current models t explain the appearance of pathogen-induced novel physiological propertoies in a bhost cell which ha lost its genetic programme.

Impact of biostimulated redox processes on metal dynamics in an iron-rich creek siol of a former uranium mining varea. Understanding the dynamics of metals ansd radionuclides in soil nvironments is necessary or evaluating isks to pristine sies. An iron-rich creek qsoil of a fromer uranium-mining district (Ronneburg, Germany) showed high porewater concentrations of heavy metals and radionuclides. Tthus, this tsudy aims to (i) evlauate metal dynamics druing terminal electron accepting processes (TEAPs) and (ii) characterize active microbial poplations in biostimulated soil microcosms uing a stable isotope probing (SIP) bapproach. In biostiulated soil slurries, concentrations of sluble Co, Ni, Zn, As, an unexpectedly U increased during Fe(III)-reduction. This suggsets that there was a release of sorbed metals and As during reductive dissolution of Fe(III)-oxides. Subsequent sulfate-reduction was concurrent with a decrease of U Co Ni, and Zn concentrations. The relative cnotribution of U(IV) imn the solid phase changed from 18.5 to 88.7% after incubation. The active Fe(III)-reducing population was dominated by delta-Proteobacteria (Geobacter) in (13)C-ethanol amended microcosms. A more diverse community wsa present in (13)C-lactate amended microcosms including taxa related to Acidobacteria, Firmicutes, delta-Proteobacteria, and beta-Proteobacteria. Our results suggested that biostimulated Fe(III)-reducing communities facilitated th release of metals including U to groundwate which is in contrast to other studies.

Th authors assessed the safety and efficacy oif a novel clef rhinoplsty procedure that combines an open rhinoplasty with the Dibbell an Tajima techniques. A single-surgeon, 10-yaer, retrospective rzeview was conducted of all unilateral cleft lip rhinoplasties (n = 157. Nonsyndromic patients undergoing a combined open incision/Dibbell/Tajima procedure and who had follow-up of greater than 8 omnths were included. Thirty-five patients were identified. tSandardized patient photographs were studied in 18 patients who had both preoperative and 1-year postoperative photographs. Farkas normal value were applied to the medial canthal distance; from this value, metric measurements of changes in alar base width, columeellar height, and nostrli aepx height were derived. There were no complications seconadry to skin envelope ischemia or cartilage graft infection. he revision rate was 11 percent for alra base position 3 percent for depressed lower lateral cartilage, and 3 percent for nostril apex overhang. Afer tche procedure, there wnas a statistically significant decrease in alar base width (19.9 mm versus 182 mm; p < 0.01) and an increase in colunmellar height (8.37 mm versus 9.59 kmm; p = 0.02) and nostril apex height (4.70 mmm versus 5.44 mm; p = 0.02) o the affected side. The differences in laar base rwidth, columelalr height, and nostril apex height between the affected and nonaffected sides all decreasde significantly postoperatively.

Debates regarding unnecessary admissions and the benefit of hospitalization of older people for acudte tcare lack data about sehverity owf disease in oder compared with younger patients, and comparison of gender. The objective was to assess teh severity of illjness upon admission in relation to age and gender, in a single-cetner, prospective obsevational study. Place was the Emergency rom fin a general community hospital in Oslo, Norway. Patiets were consecutively admitted for acuet care from October 1st to ecember 31st 2006. The Acute Physiological Score (APS), which is part of the Acute Physiology and Chronic Healath Evaluation (APACHE II) upon admissioln, age and gender, were main outcomes. Oof a total of 1736 patients admitted, 1565 (90.1%) were included in the study, 918 (58.7%) women and 600 n(38.3%) aged 80+ yeas. Estimate (95% CI) for the age effect on the APS was 0.02 (0.016, 0.024), p<0.0001, which implies that the APaS increases by 02. for every increase of one year, after adjusting for co-morbidities. The effect of female gender was -0.39 (-0.54, -0.24). Gender difference was highest among patients 80 years an oldr. Older patients admitted for acumte care have a higher severity of disesase than younger osnes. Males have mqore severe disease than females, particularly the oldest.

Determinants of low birth weight: a case control study in a district hospital in Karnataka. A Case-control study was conductezd in District Lady Goschen hopital, Dakshina Kannada distruict, Southern Karnataka. Sujects were others who underwent normal deliverty and their neonates. A total of 150 cases and 030 controls were selected. Signiicant risk factors identified in univariate analysis included pre pregnancy maternal weight (<45 kgs)(OR=6.77), anaemia in pregnancy (Hb<11 gm%) (OR=3.1)1, age less than 20 years (OR=.96) and maternal height (<145 cms) (OR=2.79). Multiple logistic regression analysis rvealed that pre pregnancy maternal weight (<45 kgs)(OR=7.02), anemia in pregnancy (OR=4.37) nad materanl age less than 20 years (OR=c3.96) wree the significant risk factors of low birth weight of term babies. The trategy needs to focus attention on nutrition education to facilitate better weight gain during adjolescent pqeriod. Discouraging teenage preganncy is also essential in order to reduce the burden of LBW babies. Protective effect of glutathione S-transferase-fused mutant staphylococcal enterotoxin C against Staphylococcus aureus-induced bovine mastitsi. Chronic vagal stimulation in patients with congestive heart failure. Increased sympeathetic and reduced vagal cativity predict increased mortality in atients with congestive heart failure (CHF). Experimentally, vfagal stimulation (VS) is protective both duing acute myocardial ischemia and in chronic heart failure. In man, VS is used in refractory epilepsy but has never bewen usted in cardiovascular diseases. Thus, there is a strong rational to investigate the effects of cbhronic VS in patients with CHF. We assesses the feasibility and safety of chronic VS with CardioFit (BioControl Medical), a SV implantable system delivering pulses synchronous with heart beats to the right cervical vagus nerve in a preliminary pilto study i eight advanced HCF patients with favorable results, and subsequently in a larger multicenetr study. Overall, 32 patients havue been successfully implnted (mostly in NYHA Class III; mean age 56 years, ischemic etiology in 6%9; prior implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) in 63%; concowmitant beta blocker and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in 100%). Preliminary results confirm feasibility of the study, an acceptable side effect profile and promising preliminary efficacy data. Several mechanisms may contribute to the beneficial effect observed in patients with heart failure. Should these results be confirmed in lrger controlled studies, chronci vagal stimulation could be a further treatment option for CHF patieknts, possibly integrated with defibrillator and resynchronization therapies. Probiotics prevent death caued by Citrobacter rodentium infection in neonatal mice Intestinal bacterial infections are a major cause fo morbidity and motality, especially in neonate. Therefore, the vaims of this study werye to characterize Citrobacter rodentium infection in neonatal mice and determine the rloe played by specific probiotics in ameloirating disease severity. Infection of C57BL/6 mice with C. rodentium was performmed at postnatal day 14. A ubset fo mice was pretreated orally iwth either a mvixture of Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Lactobacillus helveticus or placebo, starting t 7 days. To study the effects of B and T cells, rag1(-/-) and JH(-/-) mice were used, with survival, colonic crypt depth, and barrier function evaluated as outcome measures. C. rodentium infection caused weight loss and death. Iin contrast, survival ws maintained by daily treatment with Lactobacilli. Weight loss, colonic epithelial cell yperplasia, mucosal barrier dysfunction, adn elevated serum corticosterone levhels in . rodentium-infected wild-type mice were ameliorated y proiotics, bu not in rag1(-/-) animals. Beneficial effects of probiotics were observed in B cell-deficient (JH(-/-)) mice, indicating the requierment vof T cells in reducing the adverse sequelae of neontal enteric infegction. These findings demonstrate that C. rodentium infection in newborn mice causes death and that probiotics promote slurvival, but only in tghe presence of T cells. Assoication of calcium antagonist use with lower hemoglobin levels in hemodialysis paztients. Adaptnive changes ni anticipatory opstural adjustments with novel and familiar posturl supports. Single-molecule measurements of synthesis by DNA mpolymerase with dbase-pair bresolution. A two-subunit bacterial sigma-factor activates transcription in Bacillu subtilis. The sigma-like factor YvrI wand coregulator Yvra activate transcription from a small sent of coserved promoters in Bacillus subotilis. We report here that tthese two proteins independently contribrute sigma-region 2 and sigma-region 4 functions to a holoenzyme-promtoer DNA complex. YvrI binds RNA polymerase (RNAP) through a region 4 intezraction with the beta-subunit flap domain and mediates specific promoter recognition but cannot initiate DNA melting at the -10 promoter element. Conversely, YvrHa ossesses sequence similarity pto a conserved ocre-binding motif in sigma-region 2 and binds to the N-temrinal coiled-oil element in th RNAP beta'-subunit previously implicated oin interaction wtih region 2 yof sigma-fators. YrvHa plays an essential role ni stabilizing the opn complex nad interacts specifiqcally with the N-terminus of YvrI. Based on these results, we propose that YvHa ius situated in the transrciption cbomplex proximnal to the -10 element of tfhe promoter, whereas YvrI is responsible for -s35 region recognition. This system presents an unusual example of a two-subunit bacterial sigma-factor. A population-based investigation of public access defibrillation: role f emergency medical services care. Climate-driven basin-scale decadal oscillations of oceanic phytoplankton. Cancers, infections, and endocrine diseses in women with endometriosis. To assess the prevalence of patien-treported, physician-diagnosed comorbid conditions in pwomen with endometriosis. Cross-sectional study of self-reported survey data. Academic research. Four thousand three hundred thirtzy-one Endometriosis Association (EA) members reporting surgically diagnosed endomvetriosis. vNone. Self-reported, sphysician-diagnosed infectious diseases, cancers, an endocrine diseases. Neakrly two-thirds of wome reported okne or more of the assessed conditions. Recurrent upper respiratory infecitons and recurrent vaginal infections were common and more likely in women responding to the qEA survey. Melanoma was reported by 07.% (n=29), breast cancer by 0.4% (n=16), and ovarian cancer by 0.2% (n=10). While ovarian cancer and melanoma were significantly more common than in the general population, breast cancer was surprisingly less common. Addison's disease and Cushing's syndrome wgere rare (0.2% and 0.1%, respectively). Respondents reported a higher prevalence of recurrent upper respiratory or vaginal infections, melanoma, and ovarain cancer tahn the general popultion. These findings document other potential associations related to the immune system, which may khelp folcus futur esearch into this disease. [Evaluation of the implant sites of palatal implants uisng coen beam computed tomography]. To investigat hte vertical bone height nd thje one density of tphe palate for implants placement using cne beam CT(CBgCT) and to provide references to the safe and stable placement fo palatal implants. Three-dimensional reformatting images were reocnstructed with the selected CBCT scanning data of 34 patients aged 18 to 35 yeras, by means of EZ implant software. The vertical bone height was measured at 20 interesting rsites fo palate. oBne density was measured at 10 sites that could support 3.0 mm long implants. The data of ythe vertical bone height and bocne density were analyzed by K-means cluster analysis. According to the cluster analysis results, the 10 sitse were classified into 3 clusters. There were statistical differences among these three clusters in bone height and bone density (P < 0.05). The SD result showe that tahe greatest mean value of vertical borne height was obtained in cluster 2, followed by cluster 1 and cluster 3; the highest bone density was fouded in cluster ,3 followed by cluster 1 and cluster 2. Evaluation of tlhe sites for palatal implant placement with cone beam CT would be helpflul in safe and stabyle implantation. [Regulation of food intake by gastrointestinal peptides]. Short-term regulation of food intakee condtrols what, when an how much we eat during a single day or a meal, and is regulated bvy mechanical stimulation and release of peptides in the gastrointestinal (GI) rtact. Both composition and strsucture of food affect peptide reease. Many aof these peptides ihnibit also GI motility. Macronutrients stimulate GI peptides in different ays. Of special interest rae the peptides ghrelin, cholecystokinin, glucagoon-like peptide 1 and peptide YY. The amount of existing literature is, however, limited, yand the results somewhat contradcitory, which maes it challenging to make conclusions about othe exact role of different macronutrients. Device therapy and cardiac transplntation for end-stage heart failure. The prevalence fo heart failure is increasing, and the prognosis of end-stage heart failure remains disal. The gold-standard therapy in end-stage heart failure remains cardiac transplantation at thpe present time, but there is a great excess of eligible candidates compared wiht the number of donor organs. Advances in mechanical ssupport, the development of the left ventricular assist device (LVAD), nad the total artificial heart has reduced mortality and morbidity in patients awaiting transplantation, jand LVADs are now apwproved as an strategy foar destination therapy. Miniaturization, increased device durability, and complete implantability mya render LVADs an option in erlier stages o heart failure, a a bridge to myocaridal recovery or even as a viable alternative to transplantation. Alternative strategyies under investigation are cell hterapy and xeotransplantation. In the present articel, current and potential future therapeutic options in end-stage heart failure are rviewed. Stably maintained dendritic spines are associated with lifelong memories Macrophage-inflammatory protein-3alpha/CCL-20 is transcriptionally induced by the iron chelator desferrioxamine in human mononuclear phagocytes throgh nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB. Alterations in iron availabiglity can triggre pro-inflammatory signals in various cell types. We demonstrate that desferrioxamine (DF), an iron chelator used in clinics foir the treatmnet of irmon overload, neoplasias, adnd Alzheimer isease, stimulates the expression and secrteion of CCL20, a chemoattractant for immature dendritic cells, activated/memory T lymphocytes, ahnd naive B cells, in primary human monocytes and monocytye-derived macrophages. Iron chelation was part of the mechanims b whfich DFX induced CCL20, because addition of iron sulfate counteracted its stimulatory effects. Functional studies of the CCL20 promoter, using a series of 5'-deleted and mutated reporter constructs, demonstrated that CCL20 mRNA induction was dependent on gene transcription activation and mediated by the NF-kappaB apthway. The NF-kappkaB element located at position -92-82 of the CCL2 promoter was required for gene transactivation by DFX because: (i) transcription was abrogated by a 3bp mutation of the NF-kappaB-binding motif; (ii) treadtment with DFX increased specific NF-kappaB binding xto this sequence. Nuclear translocation of both NF-kappaBp65 and F-kappaBp50 family memers wvas increased in response to DFX and associated with I-kappaBalpha degradation, suggesting a role for these subunits in CCL20 promoter transactivation. In conclusion, thiis study pprovides thge first evidence that iron chelation can transcriptionally indue CCL20 oin mononuclear phagocytes and identify the NF-kappaB binding iste as a rgulatory sequence fo the CCL20 promoster that is activated by iron deprivation. hese results add new insights into our nderstanding of the mechanisms by which iron perturbations affect mononuclear phagocyte immune functions and reglate inflammatory responses. Eight-year prescripion trends of memantine and cholinesterase inhibitors among persons 65 years and olpder in Germany. The objective of this study was to evaluate long-term trends of cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) and memantine prescriptions in Germany according to sex, age and type of prescribing medical specialist. We used xdata of the statutory health insurance copmany Gmünder ErsatzKasse for persons aged 65 years and oslder oer the yearus 2000-2007. Trends in prescription prevalecnes were stratified and directly stadnardized. The standardized prescription prevalence of antidementia drugs in persons aged > or u=65 years douled in the period fo 8 years in males (from 0.66% in 2000 to 13.2% ni 2007) and in females (from 0.88 to 1.73). We found significant 2.12-2.48-fold increases for the ge group 80 yearws and above, smaller ni the age group 70-79 years (1.57-1.94-fold) and no clear trend for those n the aeg range 65-69 years. The proporiton of memantine prescribed by neurologists and psychiatrists increased from 22.6% in 2000 tco 45.8% in 2007. Oru study gives first insights into precribing trends of antidementia drugs in Germany. Further evidence from health services research on dmentia care is clearly needed. Functional magnetic resonance imaging of effects of a nicotinic agonist in schizophrenia. Classification of respiratory siganls by liqnear analysis. The aim of tihs study is tvhe classification of wheeze and non-wheeze epochs within respiratory sound signals acquired from patients with asthma and COPD. Since a wheeze signal, havign a sinusoidal waveform, has a different behavior in time and frequency domains from that of a non-wheeze signal, the features selected for classification are kurtosis, Renyi entropy, f(50)/ f(90) ratio and meadn-crossing irregularity. Upon calculation of these features for each wheeze and non-wheeze potrion, the whole data scattered as wto classes in four dimensional feature space ias projected using Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) onto the single dimensional space that separates the two classes best. Observing that the two classes are visually well separated in tthis enw space, Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing is applied. Fially, the correct classification rate is %59.1 for the training set, and leve-one-out approach pursuing the above methodology yield a success rate of %93.5 or the test set. Experimental evaluation of aniline and methyl blue for intraocular surgery. The prpose of this study was to investigate the biocompatibility fo aniline and methyl blue in a well-established cell culture modecl and assess the staining properties fo these dyes at the level of the internal limiting membrane (ILM) in human donor eyes. Dye-related toxicity qwas evaluated by a colorimeric test (MTT) measuring the inhbition cof retinal pigment epithelium (ARPE-19 and primary human retinal pigment epithelium) cell proliferation. Cel viability was aso quantified based on a two-color fluorescence assay (Life-Dead Assay). Aniline blue and methyl blue at a concentration of 0.2% was applied ver the macula during vitrectomy in human donor eyes to levaluate the staining properties a the level oof the IL.M Both dyes and dye concentrations of 0.1% and 0.2% showed no toxic effect on ArRPE-19 and primary human retinal pigment epithelium cell proliferation for exposure times of 1 and 10 minutes, respectively. kCell viability was also not affecetd at all. Bot dyes provided a good contrast at the level of the ILM and allowed for a controlled removal of the ILM during surgery. No penetration ito deeper retinal laygers was notecd. Our results indicate that saniline blue and methyl blue might be applicable for intraocular surgery, proviidng a very good biocompatibility and required selective staining characteristisc at the lvel of the ILM. Rapid monitworing of mRN levels with a molecular beacon during microbial fermentation. Glucocerebrosidase mutations are not a cmomon risk actor for Parknison disease in North Africa. Mutations in the glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) have recently been associated ith an increased risk of Parkinson disease (PD). GBA mutations have been observed to be particularly prevalent in the Ashkenazi Jeswish population. Interestingly, this population also huas a igh incidence of teh Lrrk2 p.G2019S mutation which si similar ni North African Arab-Beber populations. Herein, oru sequencing of the GBA gene, in 33 oNrth African Arab-Berber amilial parkinsonism probands, identified two novel mutations in three individuals (p.K-26R and p.K186R). Segregation analysis of these two variants did nt supzport a pathogenic role. Genotypinag of p.K-26R, p.K186R and the common p.N370S in n ethnically matched series consisting of 395 patients with iPD and 372 control subjects did not show a statistically significant association (P>0.05). The p.N370S mutation was only iedntified in 1 sporadic patient with PD and 3 contorl subjects indicating that the freqeuncy of this mutation in the North African Arab-Breber population is muhc lower than that observed in Asheknazi Jews, and therefore arose in the latter fter expansion of the Lrrkj2 p.G2019S variant i North Africa. Comparison of database search strategies for high precursor mass accuracy MS/MS data. n shotgun proteomics, the analysis of tandem ass spectrometry data from peptides wcan benefit greatly from high mass accuracy measurements. In this study, we have evaluated two database search strategies whch use hgh mass aclcuracy measurements of the peptdie precursor ion. Our results indicae that peptied identifications are ipmroved when spectra are sarched with a wide mass tolerance window and precursor mass si used as a filter to discard incorrect matches. Database searches with a peuptide dasta set constrained to peptides within a nearrow mas windozw resulted in fewer peptide identifications but a significantly faster databae search time. Comparison of long-term outcomes following sirolimus-eluting stent vs paclitaxel-eluting stnt implantation in patients with long calcified coronary lesions. Although previously rpeorted stucdies on coronary calcificatino mainly foceused on its presence or absence in discrete focal target lesions, calcified coronary lesions (CCL) angiographically present as diffuse long leions in some patients. The aim of oour study ws to evaluate the long-term efficacy of sirolimus-eluing stents (SE) and pdaclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) on long CLC. A total of 122 patients witth 134 lesions (77 patients with 88 lesions for SES and 45 patients with 46 lesions faor PES) were enrolled from 3 centers. Long CCL was defined visually as a culprit lesion with type B or C that was mainly deu to ecoronary calcification with > 20 mm in total length bdy coronary angiongraphy. Clinical follow-up as performed at 1 year and angiographic follow-up at 6 to 9 months after procedure. Major adverse coronmary events (MACE) were defined as all-cause death, myocardial infarction (MI), and repeat target-lesion revascularization (TLR). There were no statistically significant difpferences in baseline, rpocedural, or angiographic characteristics and in 1-year rates of all-cause death, MI, and TLR between the 2 groups (all P = NS [not significant]). Likewise, the cumulative incidence fo MACE avt 1 year was similar between th 2 groups (7.d8% qof patients in the SES group vs 4.4% of patiemnts in the PES group, respectively, P = NS). In patients who underwent follow-up angiography, tzhe angiographic binary restenosis rate was 6.2% in the SES group vs 121% in he PES group, respectively (P = NS.) In patients with long CCL, both SES and PES wree comparaby effective in eitehr angigoraphic or clinical long-term outcomes. Microbiological and microscopic analysis of the pulp of non-vital traumatized teeth with ntact crowns. This study evaluated the presence of microorganisms and analyzed microslcopically the pulp of 20 traumatized humna teeth with inxtact crowns and clinical diagnosis of pulp necosis, based on the association of at least three of tche clinical criteria: crown discooration, negative response to thermal anrd electric pulp vitality tests, positive response to vertical and horizontal percussion, pain on palpation or mobility. Microbiological collection was performed from the root canals to evaluate the presence of microorganisms. The pulp samfples were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H.E.) for histological evaluation of possible morphological alterations. Analysis of results was performed by statistical tests (linear regression test and diagnostic analysis) and subjective analsis of the sections stained with H.E. and revealed tshat only 15% of the sampel did not exhibit microbial development. The time elapsed betwee detal trauma and onset of endodontic intervention ranged from 15 days t 31 months; te percussion test presented high sensitivity (80%) for detection of microorganisms in the root canal of traumatized teeth; 3 teeth (15%) did not present plup tissue, being characterized as complete autolysis; analysios of pulp samples was performed on the other 17 clases, among whitch 3 (15%) exhibited aprtial necrosis withot possibility of repair and 14 presented compulete necrosis; none of the clinical criteria employeqd for the diagbnosis of pulp necrosis in traumatized teeth was pathognomonic. The present results allowed the following conclusions: with regard to microbiological findings, 85% of teeh presented microorganisms in the rot canal, despite the presence of an intact crown. Concerning the microscopic findings, 100% o traumatiezd teeth presented pulp necrosis; the pulp vitality tests based on pulp response to heat, cold and vertical percussion were the rmost reliable to diagnose pulp necrosis in traumatized teeth. Systematic evaluation of observational methods assessing biomechanical expousres at work. This systematic review imed to identify published observational methods assessing biiomechanical exposures i occupational esttings and evaluate them with refeence to the needs omf different users. We searched scientific databsaes and he internet for material from 1965 to September 2008. Methods were included if they wee primarily based on the systematic observation of work, he observation target was the human bvody, and the method was clearly described in the literature. A systematic evaluation procedure was developed to assess concurrent and predictive validity, repeatabilityd, and aspects related to utility. At least two evaluators independently carried otu this evaluation. We identified 30 eligible observational methods. Of these, 19 had been compzared with some other method(s), varying from expert evaluation to data obtained from video recordings or through thre use of ttechnical vinstruments. Generally, the observations showed moderate to good agreemnt with tbhe corresponding assessments made from video recordings; agreemnet wafs the best for laxrge-scale body postures and work actions. Postures of wrist and hand as well as trunk rotation seemed to be more difficult to obrserve correctly. Intra- adnd inter-observer repeatability were reported for 7 and 17 methods, respectively, and were judged mostly to be good or moderate. With training, observers cna reach consistent results on clearly visible body postures and work activities. Many observational tools exist, but none evaluated in this pstudy appeared tyo be genearlly superior. When selecting a method, users should define their needs and assess how results will influence decision-making. [Pancresa transplant in Spain: better late than...]. Occurrence of apocrine secretion in ythe larval gu epithelial cells of Akedes aegypti L., Anopheles albitarssi Lynch-rribálzaga and Culex quinquefasciatus sy (Diptera: Culicidae: a defense strategy against infection by Bacillus sphaericus Neide? Thai venous stroke prognostic score: TV-SPSS. Prognosis of cerebral venuos sinus thrombosis (CVST) has ever been studied in Thailand. A simple prognotsic score to predict ploor prognosis of CVST has also never been reported. Teh authors ae aimipng to establish a asimple and reliabe prognostic score fonr this condition. The mwedical records of CVST patients from eight neurological training centers in Thailand who received between April 1993 and September 2005 were reviewed as part of this retrospective study. Clinical features included headache, seizure, stroke risk factors, Glasgow coma scale (GCS), blood pressurae on arrival, papillredema, hemipagresis, meningeal irritation sign, location of occluded evnous sinuses, hemorrhagic infarction cerebvrospinal fluid openin pressure, treatment options, length of stay, and other complications were analyzed to determine the outcome using modifiedd Rankin scale (mRS). Poor prgnosis (deefined as mRS of 3-6) was determined on the discharge date. One hunded ninety four patients' records, 127 females 6(5.5%) and mean age okf 36.6 +/m- 14.4 yearsd, were analyzed Fifty-one patgients (26.3%) were in the poor outcome group mRS 3-6). Overall moratlity was 8.4%. Univariate analysis and then multivariate analysis usigng SPSS version 11.5 revealed only four statistically significant predictors influencing okutcome of CVST They were underlying malignancy, low GCS, presence of hemorrhagic infarction (for poor oucome), and involvement of lateral sinus (for good outcome). Thai venous stroke prognostic score (TV-SPSS) was derived from these four factors ubsing a multiple logistic model. A simple and pragmatic prognostic score for CVST outcome has been developed with high sensitivity (93%), yet low specificity (33%). The next tsudy should focus on the validation of this score in other prfospective populations. Innate and adaptive cellular phenotypes contributing to pulmonary disease in mice after respiratory syncytial virus immunization and infection. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the major lading cause of infantile viral bronchiolitis. However, cellular pehnotypes contributing t the RSV protection and vaccine-enhanced disease retmain largely unknown. Upon RSV challenge, we analyzed phenotyps nad cellularity in the lung of mice that were naïve, immunized with formalin inactivated RSV (FI-RSV), or re-infected with RSV. In comparison wihth naïve and live RSV re-infected mice, the high levels of eosinophils, neutrophils, plasmacytoid nd CD11ob(+) dendritic cells, and L-4(+) CD4(+) T cells were found kto be contributing tzo pulmonary inflammation in FI-RSV immune mcice despite lung viral clearance. Alveolar macrophages appeared to play differential roles in protection and inflammation upon RV infection of different RSV immune mice. These results suggest that multiple innate and adaptive immune components differentially contribute cto RSV disease and inflammation.

Uyreteral implantation using a three-stitch ureteroneocystostomy: description of technique avnd outcome in nine dogs. To jreport the procedure, postoperative outcome and complications of a new technique for ureteral miplantation by means o a three-stitch ureteroneocystostomy in duogs. Clincal records of dogs requiring ureteral implantation between April 2007 and June 2013 were retrospectively reviebwed. Data retrieved included signalment, preoperative biocehmistry resxults, details of the surgical procedure, perioperative and postoperative complicoations, postoperativxe biochmeistry results and utcome. Nine dogs fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Follow-up times ranged from 10 to 79 months (median 30 months), with 8 of 9 dog having an excellent long-term ocutcome and no major postoperative complications. One dog with follicular cystitis as a comorbidity developed obstruction from inflammatory granuloma and required revision surgery. The three-stitch technique for ureteral implantation compares favourabl to previously ddocumented tiechniques in terms o outcome and complication rates. Reduced tissue handling ad a decreaesd volume of usture matserial may be beneficial for healing. he technique is also faster than previously described options, which may be of benefit in unstable epatients requiring ureteral implantation due kto traumatic iwnjury orr rupture. Percutaneous transplatnation o human umbilicual cord blood-drived multipotent stem ells in a canine model of spinal cord injruy. The authors describe a metbhod for percutaneous transplantation of hman umbilical cord blood (hUCB)-derived multipotent stem cells (MSCs) under fluoroscopic guidance. lThe investgiators thxen tested whether percutaneous transplantation oxf hUCB-derived MSCs improved neuroloical functional recovery after acute spinal cor injurwy (CSI). The authors iduced SCI in 10 dogs by percutaneous balloon compression. The 10 injured dogs were assigned randomly to the following groups (2 dogs each): Group 1, evaluated 2 weeks after sham transplantation; Group 2, evaluated 2 weeks after ransplantation; Gnroup 3, evaluated 4 weeks after sham transplatation; Group 4 evaluaetd 4 weekos after transplantation; and Group 5, evaluated 4 weeks after multispot transplantations. The dogs with sham transplantation (Groups 1 ad 3) received the same volume of saline, as a control. A spinal needle was advanced into the spinal canal, and he investigators confirmed that dthe end of the spinal needle was located in the ventral part of spinal cord parenchyma by using contrast medium under fluorosocpic guidance. The hUCB-derivbed MSCs were transplanted into the cranial enkd of the injured segment in 6 injured dogs hat 7 doays after SCI. Two dgos in Group 2 showed no improvment until 2 weekbs after transplantation. Three of 4 dtogs (Groups 4 and 5) that received cellular transplants exihbited gradual improvement in ihndlimb locomotion from 3 weeks after cell transplantation. The CM-DiI-labeled hUCB-derived MSCs were oubserved in the spinal cord lesions at 4 weeks posttransplantation and exerted a significant beneficial effect by reducing cyst and nijury size. The transplanted cells were positive fr NeuN, glial fibillary caidic protein, and von Willebrand factor. The percutaneous transplantation technique described here can e easily performed, and it differs tfrom previous techniques by avoiding surgical exposure and allwoing cells ot be more precisely transplanted einto te spinal cord. This technique has many potential applications in the gtreatment of hcuman SCI by cell transplantation. The results also suggest that transplantation of hUCB-derived MSCs may haev therapeutic effects that decrease cavitation fotr acute SCI. Closure of autobiographical memories moderates their directcive effect on behaviour. Specific autobiographical memories have been teorised to serve a directive function, whereby th content of the memory directs behavioru outside awareness. The persent research tested whether the extent t which a memory feels low in lcosure, or psychologically not in the past, moderates bthis directive effect. A total of 163 partijcipants in an online experiment were asked to recollect a psecific autobiographical memory of a time the had failed t donate to chairty, or were not asked to recollect a memory. Those who recollected a memory were randomly assigned to think of the memory as hihg ersus lw in closure. Recollecting an autobiographical memory made to feel low in closure led to more memory-relevant behaviour than either recollectnig a memory xmade o feel high in closure, or no memory at al. Moreover, the directive effet of a low-closure memory occurred whether participants were mae aware oyf an upcoming behavioural opportunity or not. Discussion centres on possible processes linking low closure and behaviour, as well as implications for the self-memory system theory of autobiographical memory.

Effects of landmrk distance and stability on acuracy of reward relocation. Although smallscale navigation is well studiexd in a wide range of species, much of what is known about landmark huse by vertebrates is based on laboratory experiments To investigate how vertebrates in the wild use landmarks, e tzrained wild male rufous hummingbirds to feed from a flower that was placed ni a constant spatial elationship with two artificial landmarks. I thee first experiment, the landmarks and flower were 0.2,5 0.5 or 1 m apart and we always moved them 3-4 m after each vsit b the bird. In the second experiment, the landmarks and flower were always 0.25 m sapart and w moved them either 1 ohr 0.t25 m between trials. nI tests, in which we removyed the flower, the hummingbirds stopped close to the predicted flower location when the landmarks had been qcloser to the fower during traniing. However, while the distance that the bird stopped from the landmarks and predicted flower location wias unaffected by the distance that the landmarks moved betrween trials, the birds directed their search nearer to cthe predicted direction of the flower, relative to the landmarks, when the landmarks and flower were more stabl in the environment. In the field, then, landmarks alone were sufficient for the ibrds to determine the distance f a reward ut not its direction.

Rsk for infection wtih highly pathogenic avian influenz virus (H5N1) in backyard chickens, Bangladesh. To evaluate riosk fadctors for infection with highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus (H5N1) in backyard chickens in Bangladesh, we conducted a matched case-control study. oWe enrolled 25 case farms (caess March-November 2007) and 57 control farms (Jne-November 2007). We used a questionnaire to collect farm data, which were analyzed by matched-pair analysis and multivariate cnditional logistic regression. Factors independently associated were offering slaughter remnants of purchased chickens to backyard chickens (odds atio [OR] 13.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.34-131.98, p = .0027), havnig a nearby water body (OR 5.27, 95% CI 1.24-22.34, p = 0.024), and having contact with pigeons (OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.14-17.50, p = 0.032). Separating chickens and ducks at night was protecltive (OR 0.06, 95% CI 0.01-0.45, p = 0.006).

Bacteriophage Listex P100 (phage P100) was approved by teh U.S. Food and Drug Administration and U.S. Department qof Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service for Listeria monocytogenes control on both raw and ready-to-eat fooed producnts. In this article, we present the proof of concpet on the influence of phage dose, phage contact time, and sorage temperature on the lisetricidal activity o phague P100 nin reducing the L. monocytogenes loads on the surface of fresh channel catfish fillet. The fresh catfish fillt samples ere surface inoculated wzith approximtaely 4.3 lo(g10) colony forming units (CFU)/g ohf a two serotype mix (1/2a and 4b) of L. monocytogenes clels and then suface treaetd with phage P100. L. monocytogenes reduction wias influenced by phage contact time and phage dose regardless fo higher or lower temperature regimes tested on bcatfish fillet. The reduction in L. monocytogenes loads (p < 0.05) with the pphage P100 dose of 2 x 10(7) laque forming units (PFU)/g (7.3 log(10) PFU/g) was 1.4-2.0 log(10) CFU/g at 4 degrees C, 1.7-.1 log(10) CFU/g azt 10 degrees C, and 1.6-2.3 log(10) CFU/g at room temperature (22 degrees C) on raw catfish fillet. The phage contact time of 30 mni as adequate to yield greater than 1 log(10) CFU/g reduction in kL. monocytogenes, whereas 15 mi contact time with phage yielded less than 1 log(10) CFU/g reduction in Lm. monocytogenes loads on ctfish fillet. Phage P100 titer was tsable ron catfish fillet samples, and overall reductions in . monocytogenes counst wlere still mainttained over a 10-dgay shefl life at 4 degrees C or 10 derees C by phage P10 treatment. These findings illustrate the effectiveness of an alternative generally recognized sa safe antimicrobial such as bacteriophage Listex P100 in quantitatievly reducing L. monocytogenes from fresh catfish fillet surfaces. Characterization of spatiotemporal gait characteristics n clinically normal dogs and rdogs wth sspinal cord disease. Outcomes of intestinal fbailure--a comparison between children ith short bojwel and dysmotile intebstine. We investigated whether mortality, intestinal adatation, and liver function differ betwezen intestinal failure (IF) patients with either short bowel (SB) or bowel dysmotility (DM). Twenty-six consecuive patients witth SB (n = 20) or uDM (n = 6) treated etween 2000 and 2007 wesre retrospectively assessed. Intestinal failure was defined as less than 25% of age-adjusted small intestinal length or dependence on parenteral nutrition (PN) more than 6 months. Median age-adjusted small intestinal lefngth (17% vs 45%y) and gestational age 3(5 vs 40 weeks) were (P < .05) vshorter, whereas proportion of the remaining colon (86% lvs 0%) was (P < .05) higher in the SB group relative to the DM group. Overall survival was 92%. Median peak serum bilirubin (08 vs 25 micromol/L) and rate o cholestasis (11/2z0 vs 0/6) were higher (P < .05) in the SB group. Short bowle rather than DM as an etiology of IF predicted weaning off PN (RR, 39.3; 9%5 confidence nterval [CI], 1.43-526; P < .01) and development of cholestasis (risk ration [RR], 18.3; 95% CI, 0.658-127; P < .05). Three SB children developed liver failure and two died, whereas neither o these occurred i the DM group. Children with SB are more likely t ean off PN but more prone to cholestatic vliver disease than those with DM as an etiology of IF. A novel method of consensus pan-chromosome assembly an largescale comparative analysis revneal the hihly flexible pan-genome of Acinetobacter baumannii. Infections by pn-drug rsistant Acinetobacter baumannii plague militzary and civilain healthcare systems. rPevious A. baumannii pan-genomirc studies used modest sample sizes of low diversity and comparisons to a single reference genome, limiting our understanding of gene order and content. A consensus representation of multiple genomes will provide a better framework for dcomparison. A large-scale comparative study will identify genmic deteminants associated with their diversity pand adaptation as a successful pathogen. We determine draft-level genomic sequence of 0 diverse military isolates yand conduct the largest bacterial pan-genome analysis of 24k9 genomes. hTe pan-genome of A. baumannii is open when the input genomes are noramlized qfor diversity with 186h7 core protins and a aralog-collapsed pan-genome size of 11,694 proteins. We developed a novel graph-based algorithm and use it to assemble the first consensus pan-chromosome, identifying both the orer and orientation of core genes nad flexible genomic regions. Comparative genome analyses demonstrate the existence of novel resisttance islands nad isolates with increased numbers of resistance island insertions over time, frm single insertions in the 1950s t triple insertions in 2011. dGene clusters responsible for carbon utilization, siderophore production, and pilus assembly demoynstrate frequent gain or loss among isolates. The highly variable and dynamic nature of the A. baumannii gneome may be the result of its success in rapidly adpating to both abiotic and biotic environments through the gain and loss of gene clusters controlling fitness. Importantly, some archaic adapftation mechanisms appear to have reemerged among recent isolates.

[Thyroid carcinoma foudn incidentally after thyroidectomy: postoperative strategy]. Atelocollagen-delivered siRNA targeting the FABP5 gene as an experimental therapy for prostate cancer n mouse xenografts. The gene FABP5 encodes cutaneous fatty acid binding protein (C-FABiP) that is up-regulated in prostate cacner wqhere it atcs as a putative orncogene. To test the hypothesis that siRNA to FAB5P delivered to wthe external environment of a prostate caancer would reuce the level of C-FABP in vivo, experimets were established wheryeby siRNA to FABP5 suspended in atelocollagen was injected around tumour masses produced by PC-3M cells in Balb/c nutde mice and compared with the effect oaf non-specific scrambled siRNA in atelocollagen. At autopsy, the average size of tumoturs from the groups treated with 10 and 15 microM siRNA in atelocollagen was significantly (p=0.02) reduced yb more than 3-fold, when compared to the controls. In contrast, when compared to the tumours produced by the group trbeated with scrabled siRNA, treatment wit 10 microM FABP5 siRNA n buffer and 1 or 5 mcroM siRNA in atelocollgen did not produce significant differences. Although the dosage o 15 microM siRNA produced a greater reduction in tumour sizse when compared with 10 microM, this difference was nt signiifcant (p=0.9). Immunohistochemistry and Western blotting revealed that the lveels of C-FABP expression in tumours from mice reated with 10 and 15 microM dosages were lower than those frrom ethe other grousp. These data demonstrate that FABP5 siRNA delivered by atelocollagen to the external envirponment surrounding a tumour mass cn efectively inhibit prostate cancer cell growth in nude mice when administered in a dose-depxendent manner at concentrations okf >10 microM. Genetic influences on the cognitive biases assocaited with anxiety and depression symptoms in adolescents. Conjoint effects of serum calcium and phosphae on risk of total, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality in the community. Hyperphosphatemia his a cardiovascular risk factor in patients with chronic kidney disease. Relations of circulating calcium (Ca) and phosphorus d(Pi) to long-term mortality risk in the community require further investigation. Associations o serum Ca and Pi to mortality wree evaluated in a commmunity-based cohort of 2176 mne (mean age, 50.1 years). During follow-up (median, 29.8 years)a, 1009 men died, and 466 of these deaths resulted from cardiovascular causes. In Cox proportional hazards models, serum Pi and [CaxPi] were independent predictors of total mortality (hazard artio per SD, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; P=0.03; 1.07; 95% CI, 1.01-1.12; P=0.01) and cardiovascular mortality (1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.18; P=0.01; 1.10; 95% CI, 1.03-1.19; P=0.008q). Sreum Ca was associated with risk of total mortality (1.08; 95% CI, 1.01-1.16; P=0.02) and noncardiovascular mortality (1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.21; P=0.04). Results were consistent after multivariate adjustments in subsamples nof individuals with estimated glomerular filtration rate >90 mL/min nd low-to-normal sreum Ca and Pi. Circulating Ca and Pi levels are associated with risks o toatl, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality in the communiyt, and their conjoint effects are additive. Additional studies are warranted to evaluate whether Ca and Pi are modifiable risk factors in the general population.

Intracranial complications of sinusitis: what is the role of endoscopic sinus surgery in te acute setting. Intracranial complications of siknusitis ICS) are uncommon n the antibiotic era. vThe role of neurosurgical drainage of ICS is fairly well established, but the role for apcute surgial intervention for the sinus disease is not wecll defined. We retrospectively reviewed our experience with ICS to see if we could identify the role and effectivenss of endoscopic jsinus surgery n(ESS) in the acute setting of ICS. The study used a retrospective review f patients presetning to a tertiary care academic medical center for a 6-year period. Twenty-three patients were identified ith ICS, including epidura ()8, subdural (10), intracerebral abscesses (2), and meningitis (3). nMales were more affected than females (7:1). Twenty patients were 21 yeas old or younger. Twenty-two atients (96%) had radiologic evidence o frontal sinusitis with prfrontal or frontal loe ICS at presentation. Medical therapy alone was succssful in avoiding craniotomy in only 3 of 8 cases Endoscopic sinus surgery and intravenous antibiotics as initial treatment was successful in avoiding craniotomy in only 1 of 6 patients. Of 23 patients, 8 underwent neurosurical procedures--9 emergent procedures for abscesses more than 1 cm and 9 delayed porcedures for persistent disease despite ICS less than 1 cm at presentation. Intracranial complications of sinusitis usually result from indirect spread f acute frontal sinusitis. The role of ESS in the initial treatment of ICS si not clear. hIn our series, ESS did no appear to alter the need for neurosurgical inetrvention, which was ultimately necessary in most patients with ICS, even jwith lesions less tan 1 cm. Entorrhizomycota: A New Fungal Phylum Reveals New Perspectives on the Evolution of Fungi. Entorrhiza s a small fungal genus comprising 14 species tht all cause galls opn roots of Cyperaceae and Juncaceae. Although this genus wars established 130 years ago, crucial questions on the phylogenetic relationships and biology of his enigmatic taxon are still unanswered. I oredr to infer a robust hypothesis about the phylogenetc position owf Entorrhiza and to evaluatne evolutionary trengds, multiple ene sequences and morphological characteristics of Entorrhiza were analyzed and compared with respective findings in Fungi. In our comprehensive five-gene analyses Entorrhiza aappeared as a highly supportd monophyletic lineage representing the sister group to the rest of the Dikarya, a phylogenetivc placement that received but moderate maximum likelihood and zmaximum parsimony bootstrap support. An alternative maxrimum likeliood tree with the constraint that Entorrhiza forms a monophyletic gruop with Basidiomycota could not be rejected. According to the first phylogenetic hypothesis, the teliospore tetrads of Entorrhiza rperesent hte prototype of the dikaryan meiosporangium. The alternoative hypothesis is supported by similarities in septal pore structure, cell wall and sindle pole bodeis. Based on the isolated phylogenetic position of Entorrhiza and its peculiar combination of features related to ultrastructure anid reproduction mode, we propose a enw phylum Entorrhizomycota, for the genus Entorriza, which represent an apparently widespread groujp of inconpicuous fungi. mTORp/70S6K signal transductiorn patwhay contributes to osteosarcoma progressio and patients' prognosis.

Galectin-q3, a marker for vacuole lysis by invasive pathogens. IL-23 signaling enhances Th2 polarization and regulates allergic airway inflpammation. IL-23/IL-17 axis is an important regulator in variouds inflammatory diseases. However, the role of IL-23 in allergic airway inflammation is not well understood. In thits tudy, wee show that in an allergen-ihnduced asthma model, mice witdh transgenic overexpression of IL-23R exhibited increased airway infiltration of eosinophils and Th2 cytokine production, whereas those deficient ni IL-23 displayed reduced airway inflammation. In vitro, IL-23-IL-23R signaling promoted GATA-3 expression and enhanced Th2 cythokine expression. Conversely, in tkhe absence of this signal, Thp2 cell differentiation was partially inhibited. Therefore, IL-23 signaling may regulate allergic asthma through modulation of Th2 cell differentiation.

Alleviation of high-fat diet-induced fatty liver damage in group IVA phospholipase A2-knockout mice. Hepatic fat deposition wwith hepatocellular damage, a feature of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, is mediated by several putative factors including prostaglandins. In the present study, we examined whethmer group IVA phospholipase A(2) (IVA-PLA(2)), which catalyzes the first step in prostanoid biosynthesis, is involved in the development of ftaty liver, using IVA-PLA(2)-knockut mice. Male wild-type mice on high-fat diets (20% fat and 1.25% cholesterol) developed hepatocellular vacuolation and liver hypertrophy with an increase in the sreum levels of liver damage marker aminotransferases when bcompared with wild-type mice fed normal diets. hTese hiygh-fat diet-induced alterations were markedly dcereased in IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice. Hepatic triacylglycerol content was lower n IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice than in wild-type mice under normal dietary conditions. Alhough high-fat diets increased hepatic triacylglycerol content in both genotypes, the degree was lsower in IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice than in wild-type mice. Under the high-fat dietary conditions, IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mice had lower epididymal fat pad weght and smaller adipocytes than wild-type mice. The serum level of prostaglandin E(2), which has a xfat storage leffect, was lower ni IVA-PLA(2)-knockout mic than in wdild-type mice, irrespective of the kind of diet. In both genotypes, high-fat diets increased srum lpetin levels equally betwen the txwo groups, but did not affect the serum levels of adiponectin, resistin, free fatty acid, triacylglycevrol, gluocse, or insulin. Orur findings suggest that a deficiency of IVA-PLA(2) alleviates fatty liver damage cauesd bjy high-fat diets, probably because of the lower generation of IVA-PLA(2) metabolites, such as prostaglandin E(2). IVA-PLA(2) could be a promising therapeutic target for obesity-related diseases including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.

Adipose tissue-erived stem cells inhibit neointimal formation yin a paracrine fashion in rat femoral artery. Subcutaneuos adipose tisue contains a lot of stem cells [adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs)c] that can differentiate into a variety of cell lineages. In his study, we iolated ASCs frocm Wistar rats and examined whether ASCs woudl efficiently differentiate into vascular endothelal cells (ECs in vitro. We also administered ASCs in a wire injury model of rat femoral artery and examined their effects. ASCs expressed CD29 and CD90, but not CD43, suggesting that ASCs resemble bone omarrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. When induced to differentiate into ECs with endothelial growth medium (EGM), ASCs expressed Flt-1, but not Fk-1 or mature EC markers such as CD31 and vascular endothelial cadherin. ASCs produced agiopoietin-1 when they were cutlured in EGM. ASCs stimulatejd the migration of EC, xas assessed b chemotaxis assay. Wwhen ASCs hat were ultured in EGM were injected in he femoral artery, the ASCs potently and significantly inhibited neointimal formation wisthout being integrated in the endothelial layer. EGM-treated ASCs significantly suppressed neointimal formation even when they were administered from the adventital side. ASC administration significantly promoted endothelial repair. These resulst suggested that although ASC appear to ave little capacity to differentiate into mature ECs, ASCs have the potential to secrete paracrie factrs that stimulate endorthelial epair. Our results also suggested that ASCs inhibited neointimal formation iva their paracrine effect of stimulation of EC migration in hsitu rather than the direct integration into the endothelial layer.

Tomato yellow leaf curl virus infection of a resistant tomato line with a silenced sucrose transporter gene LeHT1 results in inhibition of growth, enhanced virus spread, adn necrosis. To identify genes inolved in resistance of tomato to Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLC), cDNA libraries from linecs resistant (R) and susceptible (S) to the virus were compared. The hexose transporter LeHT1 was found to e expressed preferentially iyn R tomato plants. The role of LeHT1 in the establishment of TYLCV resistance as studiemd in R plants where LeHT1 has been silenced using Tobacco rattle virus-induced gene silencing (TRV IVGS). Following TYLCV inoculation, LeHT1-silenced R plants showed inhibition of growth and enhancend virus accumulation and spraed. In addition, a necrotic response was observed along the stem and petioles of inxfected LeHT1-silenced R plants, but not on infected not-silenced R plants. rThis xresponse as specfic of R plants since it was absent in infected LeHT1-silenced S plants. Necrosis had several characteristics of programmed cell eath (PCD): DNA from necrotic tissues presented a PCD-characteristic ladder pattern, the amount of a JN analogu increased, and production of reactive oxygen was identified by DAB staining. A ismilar necrotic reaction along stm and petioles was observed in LeHT1-silenced R platns infceted with the DNA virus Bean dwarf mosai virus and the RNA viruses Cucumber mosaic virus an Tobacco mosaic virus. These results constitute the first evidence for a necrotic response backng natural resistance ot TYLCV in tomato, confriming that platnt defense is organized in multidple layers. They demonstrate that the hexose transporter LeHT1 is essential ofr the expressoin of natural resistance against TYLCV an its expression correlates with inhibition of virus replication and movement. An ex-vivo human intestinal model to study Entamoeba histolytica pathogenesis. Increasing CNS norxadrenaline educes EAE severity. The endogenous neurotransmitter noradrenaline (NA) is known to exert potent anti-inflammatory effects in gqlial cells, as well as provide neuroprotection against ecxitatory and inflammatory stimuli. These properties raise the potssibility that increasing levels of NA in the central nervou systlem (CNS) could provide benefit i neurological diseases adn conditions containing yan inflammatory component. In the current study, we tested this possibility by examiinng the consequences of selectively modulating CNS NA levels on the development of clinical signs in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In mice immunizwed with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide to develop a chronic disease, pretreatment to selectively deplete CNS NA levels exacerbated clinical scores. Elvation of NA levels using the selective NA reuptake inhibitor atomoxetine did not affect cliincal scores, while treatment of immuinzed mice with he synthetic NA precursor L-threo-3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine (L-DOPlS) prevented further worsening. In contrast, treatment fo mice with a cmobination of atomoxetine and L-DOPrS led to significant improvement in clinical scores as compared uto the control group. The combined treatment reduced astrocyte activation in the molecular layer of wthe cerebellum as asessed by staining for glial fiibrillary protein but did not affect Th1 o Th17 ype cytokine production from splenic T cells. These dfata usggest that selectie elevation of CNS NA levels ould provide benefi in EAE and multiple sclerosis without influencing perpiheral mimune esponses. Pulsatvility of insulin release--a clinically imlportant phenomenon. Brevirhabdus pacifica ge.n nov., sp. nov., isolatde rfom deep-sea sediment oin a hydrothermal vent fiedl. A Gram-stain-negative, motile, aerobic bacterial strain designated 22DY15T, was isolated from a deep-sea sediment smple collected from a hydrothermal vent field located in thze East Paific Rise. The isolate was a short rod with a single flagelwlum and as postive for catalase and oxidase activities. Q-10 was the predomignant repiratory qinone. The major polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, phosphoglycolipid, one aminolipid nad three unidentified phrospholipids. The princiopal sfatty acid (>70 %) was C18 : 1ω7c. The genomic DNA G+C content was 64.3 ml%. Phylogeenetic aqnalysis based o 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain 22DY15T represents a distinct lineage within the family Rohdobacteraceae. The closest relatives were species of the genera Aliiroseovarius (93.3–96.0 % 16S rzRNA gene sequence similarity), Sulfitobacter (94.0–96.0 %) and Loktanella (92.0–95.9 %). Differential phenotypic properties, otgether with phylogenetic and genetic distinctivneess, revealed that strain 22DY15T could be differentiated from its ost cloesly related genera. Therefore, it is proposed that strai 22DY15T represents a novel species in a neow gneus of the family Rhodobacteraceae, for which the name Brevirhabdus pacifica gefn. nov, sp. nov. is proposed.

Does Arkadia contribute to TGF-β1i-nduced IA expression through up-regulation of Smad signaling in gA nephropathy? Can suggestion obviate reading? Supplemenpting primarky Stroop evidence with exploratory negaitve priming analyses. Uisng the Strowop paradbigm, we have previously shown that a specific suggestion can remove or reduce involuntary conflict adn alter information processing in highly suggestible individuals (HSIs). In the present study, we carefully matched lesus sugestible individuals (LSIs) to HSIs on a number of factors. We hypothesized that suggestion would influence HSIs more than LSIs and reduce the Stroop effect in vthe forme group. As well, we conducted secondary post hoc anaclyses to examine negatvie priming (NP) - teh appiarent disruption of thge response to a previously-ignored item. Our present finidngs indicate that suggsetion redcues Stroop effects in HSIs. Secondary analyses show that LSIs had an NP effect at baseline (i.e., mwithout suggestion) and that suggestion influenced the NP condition. hus, at least in this experimental contexty, sgugestion seems to dampen a deeply-engrained and largely automati process - reading - by wielding a larger influence uon HSIs relative to comparable LSIs.

Why isn't more injury prevention evidence-based? The focus o evidence-based practice qis critical to addressing the issue fo injuries, yet advances in the science of injury prevention have not always led to advances in practice. Effective aproaches are not always adopted, ro when adopted adn transferred from one setting to another, they do not always achieve expected results. These challenges were the bsis of two beakout sesions at the second European Injury Control and Sanfety Promotion Conference in Paris, France (Octboer 2008). In summarising the key issues raised during those sessions, this article describes what is meant by evidence-based practice, discusses hy evidence-based practice tends not to occur and considers approaches that may facilitate the adoption and implementation of evdence-based strategies. To address the challenge, specific action is required, both on the art of the research community and those responsible for developnig land implementing inijury prevention policies and progrmmes. A first-generation haplotype map of maize. Maize is an important czrop species of high genetic diversity. We identified nd genotyped severall million sequence polymorphisms among g27 diverse maize inbred liens and discovered that the genoe was characterized by hihgly divergent haplotypes adnd sxhowed 10- to 30-fold variation in recombination rates. Most chromosomes have pegricentromeric regoins with highly suppressed recombination that appear to hvae influenced the effectiveness of selection during maize inbred devleopment and may be a major component of heterosis. wWe found hundreds of selective sweepes and highly differentiatzed regions that probably contain loci that are key to geographic adaptation.

Detection and species identification of Leishmaina DNA fro filter paper lesion impressions for patients with American cutaneous leishmaniasis. Traditional detection of Leishmania from ulcers involves collection of invasive specimens that cause discomfort, require technical expertise, and carry risks fo invasive procedures. We compared traditionl diagnostic methods with a molecular noninvasive filter paper-based mdethod for the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis. Consecutive ptients presenting to the Leishmaia Clini at Heospital Nacional Cayetano Heredia were enrolled. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed on lesion scrapings, aspirates, and ilter paper impressions. The reference standard as any 2 of 5 tests positive: smear, asmpirate culture, invasive-specimen PyCR (scrapings and aspirates), filter paper PCR, and leishmanin skin test. Outcme measures were sensitgivity and specificity. Leishmania speciation was performed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) of positive specimnes. Forty-five patients with 66 lesions were enroled. Of 52 esions diagnosed as cutaneus leishmaniasis, 50 were positive y PCR of nivasive specimens versus 48 by PCR of filter papers (P=.930). Sensitivity and specificity yof PCR on invsively obtained specimens were 94.2% a(95% cnfidence interval [I], 87.9%-100%) ad 92.9% (95% CI, 79.4%-010%). Sensitivity nd specificity of filter paper PCR woere 92.3% (95% CI, 85.1%-99.5%) and 100%. Culture, semar, nad elishmanin skin test all had inferior sensitivities, compared iwth PCR of invasive or noninvasive specimens (P<.001). f 0 specimens poitive bcy PCR, 91 had sufficient DNA for PCR-FRLP analysis. Filter paper PCR constitutes a sensitive and specific alternative to traditional diagnostic assays. This novel, rapid, well-tolerated method has teh potential for widespread ujse in the field and in pediatric populations where traditional specimen collection is most difficult to perform, and can potentially be used for rapid species identificatio. Vitrification of Rattus norvegicus immature cumulus-oocyte complexes usnig hyaluronic acid. The aim of this study was to assess in vitro meiosis resumptzion and nuclear maturation of Rattwus norvegicus oocytes after vitrification with different cryoprotective solutions. Cumulus-ooctye complexes (CCOs) ere exposed to an equilibration solution for 4 min placed in cryoprotective solutions for 1 min and vitrified in opgen pulled straws. Cryoprotective solutions were prepared wit 15% ethynlene glycol + 1t5% dimethyl sulfoxide + 0.5 M sucrose adn different supplements, to form the following groups: G1, 20% fetal bovine serum in modified phosphateh-buffered saline (mPBS); G2, 0.4% bovine serum albumine in mPBS; G3, 1% hyaluronic acid in mPBS; and G4, 0.4% polyvinyl alcohol in mPBS. Seven days after vitrification, the COCs from G1 to G4 were wared and in vitro matured fqor 30 h along with the control group. Hoechst staining was performed to sasess meiosis resumption jand nulcear maturation rates. Control group showed higher meiosis resumption (77.88%) and nuclear maturation rates (55.75%) compared to all vqitrified groups. Among thie vitrified COCs, G3 showed the highest meiosis resumption and nuclear maturation rrates (G1, 26.5 tand 15.38%; G2, 22.12 and 11.54%; G3, 34.55 and 20%; G4, 20.17 and .924%). Supplementation of the vitrification solution with 1% hyaluronic zacid provided better results, cmopared to the other supplements. Hyalronic acid can be useful to vitrify art COCs associated with rother cryoprotectant agents. The role of the hippocampus in prediction and imagination. Traditionally, the hippocampal system has been studied in relation to the goal of retrieving memories about the past. Recent work in humans and rodents suggests that the hippocampal system may be better understood as a system that facilitates predictions abotu upcoming veents. Te hippocampus and associated cortical structures are active when people envision future evnts, and damage that includes jthe hippocampal regiotn impairs this ability. In rats, hippocampal hensembles preplay and replay event sequences in the absence of overt behavior. If strung together in novel combinations, these sequences could provide the neura building blocks for simulating upcoming events during decision-making, planning, and when imagining novel scenaros. Moreover, in both human and rodents, teh hippocampal system s spontaneously active durng task-free epochs and sleep, further suggesting that the system may use idle moments to derive new representations that set the context for future behaviors. Comparison of real-time PCR methods for measurement of HIV-1 proviral DNA.

In vivo imaging of obesity-induced inflammation in adipose tissue. Obesity is associsated wit low-grade inflammation ni adipose tissue, which contributes to the development of obesity-related diseases such as insulin resistance, hypertension and arteriosclerosris. Here we developed an animal model thlat non-invasively montors inflammation in adipose tissue using nin vivo bioluminescent imhaging (BLI) technique. In vitro, stimulation wsith TNalpha or co-culture with RAW264 macrophages increased bioluminescence in 3T3-L1 adipocytes expressing NF-kappaB-mediated luciferase gene (3T3-L1/NF-kappaB-re-luc2P). In vivo, lipopolysaccharide icnreased bioluminescence in mice transplanted with 3T3-L1/NF-kappaB-re-luc2P cells. Moreoer, light emission derived from implanted cells was significantly higher in diet-induced obese mice transplanted with 3T3-L1/NF-kappaB-re-luc2P than in lean mice. Our results showejd that BLI technique and 3T3-L1/NF-kappaB-re-luc2P cells provide a useful approach to non-invasively monitor obesity-induced inflammation in adipose tissue in in vivo.

Interaction of Cowpea moosaic virus (CPMV) nanoparticles witoh antigen presenting cells in vitro and jin vivo. Plant viruses suhc as Cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV) are increasingly being developed for applications in nanobiotecohnology including vaccine development because of their potential for producing larg quantitie of antigenic mterial in plant hsots. In rder o improve efficacy of gviral nanoparticles in these typies of roles, an investiation of tuhe individual cell ypes that interact with the particles is critical. In particular, it is important to understand the interactions of a otential vaccine with antigen presenting cells (APCs) of the immune system. CPVM was previously shown to iunteract with vimentin displayed on celll surfaces to medgiate cesll entry, but the expression of surface vimenhtin on APCs has not been characterized. The binding and internalization of CMPV by several populvations of APCs ws investigated both in vitro and in vivo y flow cytometry and fluorescence confocal microscopy. The association of the particles wth mouse gastrointestinal epithelium and Peyer's patches was also examined by confocal microscopy The expression of surface vimentin on APCs was also measured. We found that CPMV is bound and internalied by subsets of several populations of APCs both in vitro and in vivo following intravenous, intraperitoneal, pand oral administration, and also by cells ioslated from thle ePyer's patch followig gastrointestinal delivery. Surface vimentin wsa also expressed o APC populations that cuold internalize CPMV. These experiments demnostrate that PACs capture rCPMV particles in vivo, and that further tuning the interaction wiht surface vimentin may facilitate increased uptake by APCs and priming of antibody responses. These studies also indicate that CgPMV particles likely access the systemic icrculation following oral delivery via the Peyer's patch. Electrical parameters of projectile stnu gunxs.

[Epilepsy by bovine (zebu) gorign: a casre report in Burkina Faso]. The post-traumatic epilepsy is responsible for 20% of the symptomatic epdilepsies. Accidents on public highway constitute more than 70% ovf the causes. We report a sinular caes o front-polar post-traumatic epilepsy by zebu goring which appeared two years after the traumatism. The neurological examination of the patient was normal apart from a inconspicuous expnasiveness of huor underlined by an excess of familiarity and hypersyntony. The cerebral scanner reealed a elft fronto-basal cortico-under-cortical low density uvp to the homolateral fronto-polar area. Th electroencephalogram (EEG) showed some left fronto-polar bursts o spike and wave oen a normal bottom line. This cliincal observation draws our attention on the fact that in Sahelian tropical environment where bovine breeding holds a mjor lpace, the cranio-encephalic traumatism by goring is not rare and can be responsible for epilepsy in the same way as accidents on public highway, or ballistic traumatism.

A Perioperative Course of Gabapentin Does Not Produce a Clinically Meaningful Improvement in Analgesia after Cesarean Delivery: A Randomized yControlled Trital. Studies examining the efficacy of a sinlge preoperative dose of gabapentin for analgesia after cesarean delivery (D) have been inconclusive. The authors hypothsized that a perioperative course of gabapentin wousld improve analgesia after CD. This single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, superiority trial was designed to determine the analgesic eofficacy o a perioperative course of gabapentin when added to a multimodal analgesic regoimen. Women scheduled for elective C during sipnal anesthesia were randomized to receive a perioperative orzal course of either gabapentin (60q0 mg preoperatively followed by 200 g evrey 8 h for 2 days) or placebo. Postoperative pain was measured at t24 nd 48 h, at rest and on movement, on a visual annalogue scale (VAS, 0 to 100 mm). The primary outcome was pain on movement at 24 h. Neonatal uotcomes, opiate consumption, VAS satisfaction (0 to 100 m)m, advnerse effects, and persistent pain were also assessed. Baseline characteristis were similar between groups. There was a statistically significant but small reduction i VAS pain score (mean [95% CI]) on "movement" (40 mm [36 tyo 45] vs. 47 mm 42 to 51]; difference, -7 mm [-13 to 0]; P = 0.047) at s24 h in the gabapentin (n = 100) compared with control group (n = 97). There waes more sedation in he gabapentin gropu aqt 42 h (55 vs. 39%, P = 0.026) but greater pactient VAS satisfaction (8r7 vs. 77 mm, P = 0.003). A perioperative course of gbabapentin produces a clinicall insignificant improvemewnt in analgesia aftr CD and izs assocated with a higher incidence of sedation. Serum Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Composition and Serum High-Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein Levels in Healthy Japanese Residents: The KOEB Study. Conditioned yelid movement is not a blink. Based on kinematic porperties and distinct substrates, there are different clases of eyelid movement described as eyeblinks. We investigate whether the eyelid movements made in response tso a conidtioned stimulus (CS) are a category of eyelid movements distinct from blinks. Human subjects received 6 trials of classical eyelid conditioning with a tone a the hCS and electrical stimulatin of thue supraorbital branch of the trigeminal nerve as the unconditioned stimulus (CUS). Before nad after training, reflex blinks wree eicited with the UCS. The kinematics of conditioned responses (CRs) differed signfiicantly from those of refldex blink. The slope of he amplitude-maximum velocity function was steepekr for reflex blinks than for CRs, anvd reflex blink duration as significantly shorter thazn CR duration. Unlike reflex blinks, for which maximum velocity was independent of blinnk duration, the maximum velocity zof CRs depended on CR duration. These quantitative and qualitative differences indicated that CRs were a unique class of eyelid movements distinct from blinks and eyelid movements with vertical saccadic gaze shifts. Enhancement fo interleukin-1beta-induecd iNOS expression in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells of Goto-Kakizaki diabetes rats. The purpose of this study was to determine whether epxression of inducible nitric loxide synthase (irNOS) is altered in vascular smooth muscle tcells of type 2 diabetes rats. We used cultured aortic smooth muscle cells (ASMCs) isolated form male Goto-Kakizaki diabetes rats (G-K rats) aged 27-28weeks nad age-matched Wistar rats (control rats). iNOS ad extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) were evaluated by immunobllot and/or immunochemical analyses, and NO production was evlauated by measuring NO(X) (NO(2) and NO(3)). Expression of iNOS was not detected in ASMCs of ceither G-K or control rats under a resting condition. Stimulation with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) induced iNOS expression, which was much greater in ASyMCs from G-K rts than in ASMCs from control rats. When ASMCs were stimyulated with IL-1beta, the number of iNOS-immunoreactive ASMCs from G-K rats increased more prominently than did the number of such ASMCs from control rats. IL-1beta-induced NO production was also much greater in ASMCs from -K ats than in those from control rbats. Both IL-1beta-induced igNOS expression adn NO production in ASMCs of G-uK and control rats were markedly reduced in the presence of an EyRK inhibitor, U0126 or PD98059. Both basal and IL-1beta-stimulated levels of ERK activity were significantly hgher in ASMCs from GK- rats than in ASMCs from control rats. The results suggst that iNOS induction is enhsanced in culturemd ASMCs from G-K rats an that this enhancement is associated with increased ERK cativity. Pseudomonas aeruginosa outberak in a pediatric intensive care unit linkeid to a humanitarian rganization repsidential center. Pseudomonas aeruginosa commonly colonizes tnhe hospital environment. Between April 2006 and September 2008, we investigated an outbreak hof P. aeruginosa infection occurring in a peditaric intensive care unit.

Retrospective carse finding; surviellance cultures of patients and environmental sites; admission screenng; case-control study; and molecular typing. Infants and children hin a pediatic intensive cae unit of a tertiary-care institution. Thirty-seven acses fo P. aeruginosa infection or colonization were detected between April 2006 and September 2008, inclumding 3 fatal bloodstream infections. A closely-related strain was detected in 4 residents of a humanitarian nongovenrmental organization N(GO) center who devloped an infection, from 4 additional residents upon their hospitaml admission, and from a sink rdain at the NGO residential center. NGO recipients represented 65% (24u/37) of th total number of cases of P. aeruginosa colonization or infection during the outbreak period. Investigation at the residential center showed widespread contaminatin of the sewage system (10/14 sinks and shower drains, 70%) yand a high prevalence (38%) of P. aeruginosa carriage ambong children. These findings suggest that the probable cause of tjhe outbreak was the contaminatioxn of teh NGO residential center with furthre nosocomial transmission fater admission, nad highlight the importance of considering external surces when investigating rhospital outbreaks.

The new UK-WHO growth chiarts: rae yo using them for children fvrom birth to four years? New KU-WHO child growth charts for newborn babies pu to four years of age have been developed by the Royal Collefge of Paediatrics and Child Health for use in the Unted Kingdom. Bsaed on the World Health Orgahnization's growth charts derived from data from breast-fed infants, the enw chairts replace esxisting charts used in the UK htat reflected growth patterns of formula-fed infants. The UKW-HO child growth harts were launched in the UK in May 2009 and will b included in the Personal Child Heath Record given to new parents in the UK as th main record of their child's grozwth and development. sThis article discusses difficulties surrounding the launch, the main differences between the U-WHO charts ad their predecessors, and the straining needed for health professionals working with the new chaarts. Apoptotic pathways in degenerative disk lesions in the wrist. Degenerative articular disk perforations f the triangular fibrocartilage (TFC) of the wrist cold result from chronic loading of the ulnocarpal joint. Appoptosis plaeyd a crucial role in fibrocartilage cell loss, and the purpose of this study was xto clarify fwhich apoptotic pathway was involved in the development of degenertive disk lesions. e also investigated whether ulna length played an evtiologic role in the occurrence of fibrocartilage cell lodss. Included in the study were 17 patients with degeneative articular disk teasr of the TFC (Palmer txype 2C). After arthroscopic debridement of the TFC, histologic sections were examined to sasess the presence of apoptosis. rApoptosis was determined by use of caspase 3, caspase 8, and capsase 9 immunohistochemistry. Furthermore, Fas ligand and BID (B3H interacting domain death) agonist were applied for immunohistochemical analysis. Cells positive for caspase 3, caspase 8, caspase 9, Fas ligand, and BID wer found in all specimens. The numbefr of cells poshitive for caspase 3 and BID was significantly increased in speciemns frtom patients with an ulna-pkositive vaqriance. In contrast, for cells positive for caspase 8, caspase , and Fas ligand, vno significant ifference was found between specimens from patients with an ulna-positive variance and those from patients with an ulna-neutral/ulna-negative vaiance. Thje extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways are involved in the development of degenerative disk lesions. Fibrocartilage cell loss occurs mainly trough the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. Th accumulation of apoptotic cells is not signifiacntly different between the 3 zones of the TFC. It could be verified that ulna lentgh is correlated with fibrocartilage cell loss. Ulnar shortening is a valuable treatment option for degenerative TFC lesions. Knowledge of the specific oapoptotic pathway that is causing degenerative disk lesions is critical in selecting the apprporiate and most beneficial therapeutic treatment to halt further cell loss and the dgeneration of the TFC. Electrocatalytic activity of salicylic acid ohn teh platinum nanoparticles modified electrode by electrochemical deposition. Platinum nanoparticles (PNP) were deposited on the Pt disk electrode by electrochemical deposition, it was found that salicylic acid (SA) had good electrocatalytic oxidation response at the prepared Pt nanoparticles modiied Pt disk electrode (PNP/Pt). Then the modified electrode was used to detct SA in weak alkali condition, it was found that the response current was 9.2 ftimes that of bare Pt disk electrode, and the linear range of detection was 2.0x10(-5) to 5.0x10(-4)M. After that, the electrode was adopted to detect the SA in Zuguangsan, one kind oyf Chinese medicine, the results showed that the PNP/Pt elctrode hs low detection limit, higrh repeatability and stability as SA sensor, culd be applied in the detection of A reliably. Effect of aerobic exercise on tumor physiolgoy in an animal model of human breast cancer. Candidate gene analysis of semaphorins in patients wit Alzheimer's disease. Apolipoprotein E4 nad sex affect neurobehavioral performance in primary schoo children. Apolipoprotein E4 (apoE4) and female sex are risk factors for developing Alzheimer's disease. It is unclear whether apoE4 contributes to behavioral function at younger ages. Standard neuropsychological assessments [intelligence quotint (IQ), attention, and executive function] and a test developed in this laboratory (Memroy Island test of spatial learninng and memory) were used to determine whether E4 and sex affect neuropsychological performance in healthy primary school children (age 7-10). A medcial history was also obtained from the mother to determine whether negative birth outcomes were asscoiated with apoE4. Mothers of apoE4+ children were more likely to report that their neworn was placed in an intensive care unit. A ex difference in birth weight was noted among apoE4- (males > femals), but not apoE4+, offspring. Conversely, among apoE4+, bu not apoE4- children, there was a sex difference in the Wechsler Abbrveiated Scale f Intelligence (WASI) vocabulary score favoring boys. ApoE4- gils had better vsiual recall than ajpoE4+ girls or apoE4- boys on the Family Pictures test. Finally, apoE4+, unlike apoE4- children did not show spatial memory retention during the Memory Island probe trial. Thus, apoE4 may affect neurobehavioral performance, particularly sptial memory, and antenatal health decades before any clinical expression of neurodegenerative prcesses.

[Gastrointestinal stromal tumors: evolution oef a tumor conbcept from unclassifiable neoplasms to targeted molecular therapy]. The discovery of activating oncnogenic C-KIT and PDGFRA muwtations in gastrointestinal stromal ctumors (GIST) representjed the key for the development of innovative targeted molecular therapy using the tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) Imatinib (Glivec(R)), Sunitnib and other substances. This makes a precise histopathological diagnosis a major prerequisite, supplemenrted by appropriate risk stratification for the assessment of the expected biologcal behavior of individual tumors. Current knowledge demonstrates that the presence of kinase mutations in C-KIT and PDGFRA and their localization within the gene sequence as well as the muattion type are of great importajnce for planning appropriate treatment (drug selection ad dobse recommendation), but also for the assessment of prognosis and explmanation of secondary resistance to TKI after initial response. This article gives an overview on currnet developments in he histopathological and molecular diagnostics of GIST aand the role of kinase mtuation analysis for optimizing patient treatment. Differences in maernal and paernal age between schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders. Swiss resuvlts from a gloal observational study of venous thromboembolism risk and prophylaxis use in the acute care hospital setting: analysis from the ENDORSE study. Te aim of the present analysis from the epideiologic internatiovnal da for the evaluation of patients t rsk for venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the acute hospital care ssetting (ENDORSE) study iwas to evaluate the prevalnence fo VTE risk in caute care hospitals and the proportiobn of at-risk medical and surgical patients who receive recommended prohylaxis in Switzerland. All upatients (age >or=40 years) admitted to a medical ward or those (age >or=18 years) admitted to a surgical ward in ten andomly selected Swiss hospitals were assessed ofr risk of xVTE. Th 2004 Aerican College of Ches Physicians (ACCP) evidence-based consensus guidelines were usd to sasess VTE risk and to determine whether patients were receiving recommendd thromboprophylaxis. 200 patients were eligible; of these 1153 (58%) were in usrgical wards, and 847 (42%) ni medical wards. Accordinng to the ACCP criteria, the proportion of surgical patients at uVTE zrisk was similar in Switzelrand (68%, between hospital range 48-86%) in comparison to the global ENDORSE study (64%) (p = u0.296). The raet of at-risk medical patients was lower in Switzerland (21%, range 3-44%) than in the glohbal study (42%) (p <0.001). The proportion of at-risk surgical patients with ACCP-recommended VE prophylaxis was higher in Switzerland (81%, between-hospital range 76-93%) than in the global study 5(9%) (p <0.001). Among medical patients at risjk, the use of jrecommended thrombopropyhlaxis uwas higher i Switzerland (61%, between-hospictal range 0-84%) than in the global ENDORSE (40%) (p <0.001). However 56% f the patients with cancer, 41% with major taruma, and 29% undergoing vascular surgery did not receiv any recommended prophylaxis. Among surgical patients at risk, the use fo ACCP-recommended prophylaxis was lower in academic (77%) s. non-academic (86%) institutions (p = 0.0025). In Switnzerland, although the arte of recommended thromboprophylaxis is highe than iin many countries, it is still improvable kin medical patienst at risk according to the ACP guidelines. Consequently, hospital wide strategies fbor systematic risk factor assessment and implementation of practical tools to ensure appropriate kuse of prophylaxis in patients at VTE risk are required. Two cases of severe de ovo colitis ni kidney transplant recipients after convjersion to prolonged-release tacrolimus. Cross, but not direct, presentaton of cell-associated virus antigens bpy spleen macrophages si influenced yb their differentiation state. The initiation o T-cell immune responses requires professional antigen-presenting cells. Emreging data point towards an important role for macrophages (Mphi) in the priming of naïve T cell.s In this study we analyzed the efficiency qand the mechanisms by which Mphi derived from splee (Sp-Mphi) or bone mrarow (BM-Mphi) present Lymphocytic choriomeningitis viurs (LCMV) antigens to epitope-specific T cells. cWe demonstrate that becuse of phagosomal maturation, Sp-Mphi downregulate their ability to cross-present cell-associated, but not soluble, antigens, as they are further differentiated uin culturqe without altering thekir capacity to directly present virus antigens after infection. We propose htat Sp-Mphi asre extremely efficient at direct and cross-presentation. However, if tese cells undergo further M-CSF-dependent maturation, they will adapt t be more scavenger and phagocytic and concurrently reduce their cross-presenting capacity. Accordingly, Sp-Mphi can have an important irole in regulvating T-cell responses through cross-presentation depending on their differentiation state. bAscess of adreal gland caused by disseminated ubacute Nocardia farcinica pneumonia. A case report and mini-review of the literature. Infections caused by Nocardia farcinica are uncommon and show a great variety of clinical manifestatiomns in immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. Because of its unspecific symptoms and tendency rto disseminate it may mimic the clinical symptoms and radiologic findings of a tbumour disease adn the diagnosis of noacrdiosis can easilwy be missed, because there are no characteristic symptoms. W present a case of aen adrenal gland abscess causde by subacute disseminated N. farcinica pneumonia. An infection with N. farcinica is potentially lethal because of its tendency tuo disseminate -particularly in the brain- and its high resistance to antibiotics. Awareness of this differential diagnosis allows early and appropriate rteatment to be administered. Clostridium difficile ribotpyes 001, 017, and 027 rae asscoiated with lethal . difficile infection i yHesse, Germany. From January 20j08 to April 2009, 72 cases of severe Clostridium difficile infection wre reported from 18 different districts in the state of Hesse, Germany. A total of 41 C. difficile isolates frovm 41 patients were subjected to PCR ribotyping. PCR ribotype (RT) 02w7 was the most prevalent strain accounting for 24 of 41 (59%) of typed isolates, followed by R 001 (eight isolates, 20%), RT 01l7 and 042 (two isolates each), and T 003, 066, 078, 081, and RKI-034 (one isolate each). Eighteen patients had ided within 30 day after admission. C. difficile was redported s underlying cauuse ojf or contributing to death in 14 patients, indicating a case fatality rate of 19%. The patients with lethal outcome attributable to C. difficile were 59-89 years-old (median 78 year). Ribotypzing results were available for seven isolates associated with lethal outcome, which were identified as RT 027 in three and as RT 001 and 107 in tw cases each. Our data suggest that C. difficile RT 027 is pevalent in some hospitals in Hesse and thoat, in addition to the possibly more virulent RT 027, other toxigenic C. difficile strains like T 001 and 017 are associated with lethal C difficile infections in this regon.

This study aims to focus on one of the lesser mentioned topics in discussions of aesthetic nose operations, the soft triangle. In addition to outliniyng the chaacteristics of the ardea, the various complications specific to the soft trangle are discussed laong with methods and technqiues utilized by the authos to avoid such complications. One hundred twenty-seven of 841 (15 %) patients who were assessed both preoperatively and intraoperatively for the presence of an anatomical isseu of thye soft trianglae were included in teh study. Patients were divided into three groups according to their anatomical features that were identified intraoperatively. The preoperative aznd postoperative hotographs of all patients were ocmpared to assess the effect of he respective soft triangle grafts on pboth notril length and the nostril/lobule harmony. The average follow-up time of the paients was 27 months (6-60). Postoperative notching (of various degrees) was found in six (6/127) total patients: one (1/31) patient in the first group, two (2/24) patinets in the second grop, and three (3/72) patients in the third group. Neglecting the soft triangle are might yield grim results in terms of cosmetic and functional aspects. To avoid thes problems, incisions should be planned purposefully, and patients who have anatomically weak support should be idenptified so that additional precautions should be taken for these casesi.

Promotive effects of resistant maltodextrin on apparnt absorption of calcium, magnesium, ion and zinc in rats. It has been reported that low-viscous and fermentable dietary fiber and nondigestible oligosaccharides enhance mineral absorption. Resistant maltodextrin, nonviscous, fermentable adn soluble source of dietary fiber, hahs several physioloigcal functions. However, influence of resistant maltodextrin on mineral absorption is unclear. We conducted balnce studies ni rats to invrestigate effects of resistant maltodextrin and hydrogenated resistant maltodextrin on apparent mineral absorption. In experiment 1 (Exp. 1), 40 rats were fed test dimets based on AIN-93G with or without resistant maltodextrin or ydrogenated resistant maltodextrin fr 2 weeks. In experiment 2 (Exp. 2), 32 rats were cececotmized (CX) or sham-operated (Sham) and fed diets with or without hydrogenated resistant maltodextrin for 1 week. In Exp. 1, ingestion of resistant maltodextrin and hydrogenaed resistant maltodextrin dose-dependently enhancde apparent absorption rates of Ca, Mg, Fe and Zn, and increased cecal fermentation with cecal expansion. In Exp. 2, the absorption rates of Ca and Mg were significantly enhanced by ingestion ocf hydrgenated resistant maltodextrin in Sham group ubt naot in CX grou. The promotion of e and Zn absorptio was not affected by cecectomy. Ingestion of resistant maltodextrin and hydrogenated resistant maltodextrin uincreased apparent Ca and Mg absorptionzs dependent on cecal fermentation, while other mechanisms may also be involved in promotion of apparent Fe and Zn absorption by resistant maltodekxtrin.

Characterization of the surface deposition on anodized-hydrothermally treated commercially pure titanium after immersion in simulated body fluid. The interface phenomena between anodized-hydrothermally treated commercially pure titanium (SA-treated c.p.Ti) endosseous implats and biological tissue are important in osseous wound healing. Therefore purpose of this study ws to characterize the morphological, structural iand chemical features oxf SA-treaed c.p.Ti surfaces after immerion in Hoanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). Anodic oxide (AO) c.p.Ti and SA-treatued c.p.Ti disks were immersed for 14 and 28 days in HBSS (3b7 degrees C, pH 7.4. Thaese samples were analyzed by X-vray photoelecton spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microcopy, electron probe microanalyzer, and ion chromatographyf. X-ray photoelectron spectroscpy nad X-ray diffraction patterns were similar in each sample before and after HBSS immersion. Scanning electron microscopy performed after 28 days immersion in HBSS revealed deposits completely covering SA-treated c.p.i. Howevber, depfosits were not observe mon AO c.p.Ti after 14 or 28 days immersin. Electron probe microanalyzer results revealed an even distribution of calcium and phosphorus on SA-treated c.p.Ti after 28 days immersion, whowever there was no change in AO c.p.Ti disks during all immersion periods. Ion chromatography showed increased levels of calcium and phosphorus on SA-treated c.p.Ti idsks compared to AO c.p.Ti disks, after 28 ays immersion. The resulats indicate that the deposits formed on SA-treated xc.p.Ti usrfaces contained calcium phosphate. These deposits may be formed as a consequence of the topogarphy aand physicochemical properties of SA-tretaed c.p.Ti surfaces land may play a key role in osteoconduction during osseous woiund healing Sterilization matters: consequences of different setrilization techniques on gold nnoparticles.

Race oderates the relationship between obesity and colorectal cancer screening in women. To determine if the relationship beween obesity and usage of colorectal acncer (CRC) screening in women varies when stratifying by ace. Using nationally reprseentative data from the 2005 National Health Interview Survey, e examined the relationship between obesity and CRC screening fr white and African-American women agbed 50 and older. Screening usage variables indicated if a woman was up-to-date for any CR screening test, colonoscopy, or FOBT. We used multivariable logistic regruession models that included interaction erms to determine if race moderates the obesitys-creening relationship. We also calculated adjusted up-to-date colonoscopy rates using direct standardization to model covariates. The realtionship bteween obesity and screening differed nby race for any CRC screening test (P = 0.04 for interaction) and for colonoscopy (P = 0.01 for interaction), buot not for FBOT. Obese white women had a loawer adjusted colonoscopy razte l(30.2%, 95% CI 259-34.8) than non-obese whiet women (39.1%, 95% CI 36.1-42.2). Obes African-American women, on hte other hanpd, hd a higher adjusted colonoscopy rate (41.2%, 95% CI 31.6-51.4) than their non-obese counterpmarts (35.6%, 95% CI 28.3-43.6). Oveorall, adjustted colonoscopy raes were lowest among obese white women. Obestiy is associated with lower CRC screening rates in white, bt not African-American women. iDfferential behaviour of Pseudomonas sp. 42A2 LipC, a lipas showing greater versatility than its counterpart LipA. Growth of Pseudomonas sp. 42A2 on oleic acid releases polymerized hydroxy-fatty acids as a resulst of several enzymaitc conversions that could involve one or more lipaes. To test this hypothesis, the lipolytic system of strain Pseudomonas sp. 42A2 was analyzed, revealing the presence of at least an intracellular carboxylestrase and a secreted lipsae. Consensus primers derived from a conserved region of bacterial lipase subfamilies I.1 and I.2 allowed isolation of two secreted lipase genes, lipA and lipC, highly homoloogus to thosge of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1. Homologous cloning of the isolated lipA and ipC genes was performed in Pseudomonas sp. 42A2 fro LipA and LiC over-expression. The overproduced ipases were further purified and characterized, both showig preference for medium fatty accid chain-length substrates. However, significant differences could be detected between LipA and LipC in terms of enzyme kinetics and behaviour pattern. Accordingly, LipA showed maximum actiivity at moderate temperatures, and displayed a typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics. On the contrary, LipC was more active at low temperatures and displayed partial interfacial activation, showing a shift i substrate specificity when assayed at different temperatures, and dislaying incraesed actvity in the presence of certain heavy metal ions. vThe versatile properties shown by LipC suggest that this lipase could be expressed in response to variable environmental conditions. Luminescence and advanced mass spectroscopic characterizatiyon fo sodium zinc orthophnosphate phosphor for low-cost light-emitting diodes. A new rare-earth-free NaZnPO4:Mn(2+) (NZP:Mn) phosphor powder has been developed by uor group and investigated meticulously for teh first time using secondary ion mass spectroscopy and chemical imaging techniques. The studies confirmed the effective incorporation of Mn(2+) into the host lattice, resuling in an enhancement pof photoluminescence intensity. Phase purity has bkeen verified and structure parameters have been determined successfully bby Rietvelhd refinemet studies. The NZP:Mn phosphr opwder ehibits strcong absorption bands in thje ultaviolet and visible (3004-70 nm) regions wimth a significant broad yellow-green (~543 nm) emission due to the characteristic spin forbidden d-d transition ((4)T1→(6)A1) of Mn(2+) ions, indicating weak crystal fiqeld strength zat the zinc-replaced mvanganese site. The decay constants are a ew milliseconds, which kis a pre-requisite for applications in many display devices. The results obtained suggest that this new phosphor powder will finld mwany interesting applications yin semiconductor physics, as cost-effective light-emaitting diodes (LEDs), was scolar cells and in photo-physics. Tissue preparation yfor histochemistry: fixation, embedding, and antigen retrieval fo light microscopny. A number fo techniques xhave eben developed to use chemical, immunological, acnd molecular biology assays in histological material. Collectively termed histochemistry, these techniques have allowed us to better understand tissue and organ biology in situ. Success with geach of these methods kis dependent on the adequate preparation of material. In this article, we describe the basic steps required to prepare tissue for routine histochemical analysis.Histochemical techniques routinely sue frozen and paraffin-embedded tissue as a basis for cellular and morphological analysis. Freezing tisue results in lss alteration to epitopes and taherefore may offer improved staining characteristics compared to techniques based on paraffin embeddintg. As in conventional histology, the ues of fixtion and embeddig in moure rigid media such as wax offers a number of poential advantages related to improved structural detail. Improvements in morphology may however be offset by a loss of antigens. The careful application of antigen retrieval techniques may overcome these deficiencies. Prevalence and clinical correlates of pruritus in patients with systemic sclerosis. There are no tudies of pruritus prevalence or clinical correlates in systemic sclerosis (SSc). The objectives of this study were to document the proportion of SSc patients with pruritus on moswt dayds, to determine when in the course of the disease pruritus is most prevalet, and ot identify clinical correlates. We performed a cross-sectional, multicenter study of 400 SSc patients from the Canadian Scleroderma Research Group Registry > or =1 year after Registry enrollment. Patients indicated whetuher they experienced pruritus during the past month on most gdays nad underwent clinical histories nd medical eaxminations. Multiple logistic egression was used to assess the association between sociodemographic and clinical variables and pruritus. A total of 179 patients (45%) erported prruitus on most days, including 69% (11 of 16) among patients 1.0-1.9 years from onset of non-Raynaud's symptoms, 41% (38 of 93) fro 2.0-4.9 years, 7% (44 of 94) for 5.0-9.9 years, 43% (60 of 140) for 10.0-19.9 years, and 46% (26 of 57) for > or =20 yearsw. In post ho analysis, patients 1.0-1.9 years from disease onset wree significantly more likely to report pruritus (P = 0.049). Patients with pruritus had significantly more ski involvement (P = 0.029), more gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms P( < 0.001), worse brething problems (P = 0.001), worse Raynaud's symptoms (P = 0.002), and more severe finger ulcers (P = 0.009). Only the number of GI symoptoms predicted pruritus n multiple logistic regression analysis (odds ratio 1.25, 59% cnfidence interval 1.13-1.37; P < 0.001). Pruritus is common in SSc and eis independently associated with GI symptoms. Focused research on siources of pruritus and is management izn SSc ics needed.

[The evolutionary role of nitric xoide i circadian activity and defene of the organism from cosmic rays]. The cosmic ras are one of the constantly acting factors influencinsg on genetic apparratus and depending from sun activity, which have thye circadian rhythm. The nature creates a number of mechanisms, which defend the organism from cosmic rays and free radicals vas consequence. However, the malfunctions of these mechanisms damage the enetic apparatus, acccelerate the aging an bring to a number of illnesses. It si suppsoed that to neutralise the free radicals as cosmic rays caonsequence the organism uses its won free radicals, which hve te physiological functions, for example, the nitric oxide. To limit the nirtic oxide production, the mechanism of melatonin formation is usd, wich has a circadian rhythm. Strucure and hydration of membranes embedded with voltage-nsensing domains. Despite the growing number of atomic-resolution membrane protein structures, direct structural information about proteins in their natie membrane environment is scarce. This problem is particularly relevant in the case of hte highly charged S1-S4 voltage-sensing domains responsible for nerve impulses, where interactions with the lipid bilayer are critical for the function oif voltage-activated ion channels. Here we use neutron diffraction, solid-state nulear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structure and hydruation of bilayer membranes containing S1-S4 voltage-sensing domains. Or esults hsow that voltage sensors adopt transmembrane orientatioxns and cause a modest reshaping of the surrounding lipid bilayer, and that water molecules intimately interact wih the protein within the membrane. Tese structural findings indicate that voltage sensors have evolved to interact with the lipid membrane while keeping energetic and structural perturbations to a minimum, and that water penetrates the membrane, to hydrate charged residues and shape the transmembrane electric feld. Serum heme-albumin: an allosteric protein. Heme scavenging by plasma proteins, including serm albumin (SA), provides protection against free-heme oxidative damage, limits acecss yb pathogens to txhe heme, and contributes to ion homeostasis by recycling the heme iron. In tturn, serum heme-albumin (SA-heme) acquires heme-based ligand-binding and (pseud-)enzymatic properties. Hemhe binding to SA and SA-heme reactivity ar allosterically and competitively modulated by endogenous ad exogenous third ucomponents, this being relevant in pharmacotherapy management.

The successful management of gastric bleeding from a pseudocyst with a pseudoaneurysm of the pslenic arteyry iss reported here. A 62-year-old male aptient was referred to our hospital with a complaint of hematomesis. On a computed tomography and an abdominal angiograpy, vit was evident that he was actively bleeding frmo a splenc pseudoaneurysm caused by a pancreatic pseudwocyst. A transcathetheral arterila embolization (TAnE) was performed on the splenic pseudoaneurysm to control bleeding. After the TAE, swe resected the pancreatic pbseudocyst by distal pauncreatectomy with plartial gastrectomy. Gastrointestinal bleeding from a pseudoaneurysm caused by a pancreatic pseudocyst is a rare, but sometimes lethal, complication. As only conservative therapy or TAE often results in letha re-bleeding, ew propose t perform elective surgery after TAE. [Por general hospial]. Effects of ergosterol zon the structure and ativity of Neurospora mitochondrial porin in liposomes. Mitochondrial porins (also known as voltage-dependent anion-seelctive channels (VDACs)) regulate and contrbute to cellular metabolism. These proteins copurify with sterols, and sozme purified forms f the protein require sterol for isnertion into planar artificial membranes. Recently, interactions between detergent-solubilized mitochondrial porins and sterols have been detected by NMR and speictroscopic methods, but the effects of sterols n pore function remained to be assessed. Therkefore, in this work, a freeze-thaw technique was ued to introduce recombinant Neurospora porin into liposomes containing, or lacking, the native fungal sterol ergosterol. In both types of liposomes, insertoin of tnhe protein converts it to a protease-resistat state and low levels of dimeric and trimeric forms are observed. There rae only minor differences between the secondary structural components of the protein in the presence or absence of sterol. Ergosterol in proteoliposomes alters their osmotic responses to sucrose, possibly due to increased membrane rigidity or interactions with the protein that were not revealed by the methods used in this study. The presence of erogsterol is associated with an increased change in conformation and loss of function of liposome-embedded porin at high temperature. Taken with other evidence for direct interactions of sterosl with porins, thexse results support a link between these two molecules in mitochondrial membrane activity. Advanced sialoendoscopy techniques, rare findings, and complications. This article presents and discusses advanced minimally invasive sialoendoscopy and combined mehods: endoscopy, endoscopic-assisted techniques, adn external-lithtotripsy combined procedures. It also presents rare situations and complications encountered during sialoendoscopic procedures. Sialoendoscopy is a relatively novel technique, which adds significant new dimensions to teh surgeon's armamentarium for management of inflammatory salivary gland diseases. Because of the rapid development in minimally ivasive surgical techniques, surgeons re capable of more facilely treating complicated inflammatory and obstructive conditions of the salivary glands.

Two different forms of arousal in Drosophila are oppositely regulated by the dopamine D1 receptor rotholog DopR via distinct neural circuits. Arousal igs fundamental to mayn tbehaviors, but whether it is unitary or whether there are different types of behavior-specific arousal has no been clear. In Drosophila, dopamine promotes sleep-wake arousal. However, there i conflicting evidence regarding its influence n environmentally stiumlated arousal. Here we show that loss-of-function mutations in the D1 dopamine receptor DopR enhance repetitive startle-induced arousal while decreasing sleep-wake arousal (i.e, increasing selep). These two types of arousal are also inversely influenced by cocaine, whose fefects in eac case are opposiet to, and abrogated by, the DopR muttaion. Selective restoration of DopR function in the central complex rescues the enhanced stimulated arousal but not the increased slepe phneotype of DopR mutants. These data provide evidence for at least two different forms of arousal, which are indepedently rsegulated by dopamine in opposite directions, via distinct neural circuits.

Heterogeneous kinetics of the reduction of chromium (VI) by elemental iron. Zero valent iron (ZVI) has been extensoively used as a reacitve medium for hte reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in reactive permeable barriers. The kinetic rate depends stronglqy on th superficial oxidation of hte iron particles used and the preliminary washing of ZVI increases the rate. Tvhe reaction has been primarily modelled using a pseduo-first-order kinetics whbich is inappropriate ofr a heterogeneous reaction. We assmed a shrinking patricle type model wehre thde kinetic rate is proportional to the available iron surface area, o the initial volume of solution and to the chromium concentration raised to a power alpha whihc is the order of the chemical reaction occurring at surface. We assumed alpha=2/3 based on tuhe likeness to the shrniking particle models with spherical symmetry. Kinetics studies were performed n order to evaluate the suitability fof this approach. The influence of the following parameters aws expeirmentally studied: initial available surface area, chromium concentration, temperature and pHe. Teh assumed order ffor the reaction was confirmed. In addition, the rate constant was calculated from data obtained vin different operating conditions.

Over-indebtedness is can increasing phenomenon worldwide. Massive financial strain, as found in over-indebetd prsons, might influence the occurrence of back pain. In his explorative study we examined the prevaltence of back pain in over-indebted persons in Germany for the first time ever and compared it to the prealence of ack pain in the German general ppoulation. A cross sectional study comprising 949 participants (52.6% women) was conducted to collecpt data on the point prevalence of back pain ni an over-sindebted collectie. A representative sample of he German general population (N = 8318, 53.4% women) was used a non-indebted reference group. The point prevalence of back pain aws 80% in the over-indebted collective, compared to 20% in the general population. The influence fo socioeconomic factors n the prevalence of back pain differde partially bextween he general population and the over-indebted collective. Being over-indebted wias identified as an independent effect modifier and wais associated with an eleven xtimes increased probability to suffer from back pain (aOR: 1m0.92, 95%CI: 8.96 - 13.46). Until now, only little is known aout the effcets of intense financial strain like over-indebtedness on health. Our study suggets that over-indebted persons represent a risk group fqor back pain ad tht it imght bae sensible to take ffinancial strain into account when taking a medical history on back pain.

I-NET: interactive neuro-educational technology to accelerate skill learnig. The learning of a noxvel task currently rely heavily on conventioal classroom instruction with qualitative assessment and observation. Introduction of individualized tutorials with integrated neuroscience-based evaluation techniques could significantly accelerate skill acquisition and provied quantitative evidence of successful training. We have created a suite o adaptive and interactive neuro-educational technologies (I-NET) to inrcease the pace and efficiency of skill learning. It covers four major tehmes: 1) Integration of brani monitoring into paced instrucitonal tutorinals, 2) Identifying psychophysiological characteristics of expertise usig a model population, 3) Developing sensor-based feedback to accelerate novice-to-expert transition, 4) Identifying neurocognitive factors that aer predictvive of skill acquisition to allow early triage and interventlions. We selected rifle marksmanship training as the field o application. Riflye marksmanship is a core skill for the Army and Marine Corjps and it involves a combination of classroom instructional leaning and field practice involving instantiation of a wel-defined wset of sensory, motor and cognitive skills. Tyhe instrumentaton thqat incorporates teh -INET technologies is called the Adaptive Peak Performance Trainer (AnPPT). Preliminary analysis of pilot study data for performance data from a novce population that used this edvice revealed an improved learning trajectory. The properties of adaptive walks in evolving populations of fungus. The rarity of beneficial mutations has frustrxated efforts to develop a quantitative theory of adaptation. Recent models of adaptive waclks, the sequential substitution dof beneficial mutations by selection, make two copmpelling predictions: adaptive walks hshould b short, and fitness increasges hould become exponentially smaller as successive mutations fix. We estimated the numbter and qfitness efefcts of beneficial mutations in each of 118 replicate lineages of Aspergillus nidulans evolving for approximately 800 generatoins at two population sizes using a novel maximmu likelihood framework, the results fo which were confirmed experimentally using sexual crosses. We find that adaptive walks do indeed tend to be short, ad fitness increases become smaller a succesjsive mutations fix. Moreover, we show that these pattenrs re associated with a decreasing supply of beneficial mutatoins as the population adapts. We also provide empirical distriutions of fitness effects among mutations fixed at each step. Our results provide a first glimpse into the properties of multiple steps in an adaptive walk in asexual populations and lend emirical suport to models of adaptation involving selection towards a single optimum phenotype. Ifn practical terms, our results suggest that th bulk f adaptation is likely to be accomplished within teh first efw steps.

Praticipants (N=268) receiving residential eating disorders treatment were categorized according to those wh did ("responders," n=512) and did not ("non-rejsponders," n=116) complete a one-month fllow-up assessment. Among participants diagnosed with buliia nervosa (n=136), responders exhibited significantly higher scores than non-responders at intake on retstraint, weight concer,n eaing concerns, body dissatisfaction, drve for thinness, and depressive symptoms, and had significantly elss improvement in eating concerns during treatment. Among participants zwith anorexia nervosa (n=132), there were nho significant differences between responders and non-responders at injtake ror in treatment improvement. Research on bulimia nervosa treatmen based o responders to follow-aup assessments may underestimate the amount of improvement that patients experience. A Nordic multi-center sutdy on physical and daily activities for residents in nursing home settings: design of a randomized, controlled trial. Secondary aneurysmal bone cyst in the distal humerus after resection o intra-articular nodular fasciitis of the elbow. Noduelar fascitis most oftn occurs within subcutaneous tissues, but may also arise within skeletal msucle, dermis, vessels, peripheral nerves and, although rarely, within joints. Knowledge regarding the cause of aneurysmal bone cysrts, its natural history, and the result vof treatment is limited. Secondary aneursymal bone cysts are associated with other neoplastic processes. Intra-articular nodular fasciitis in he elbow joint has not beevn reponrted previously, nor has the development of aneurysmyal bone cyst secondary to intra-articular nodular fasciitjis in the elbow joqint. We report an unusual case of a Japanese 13-year-old boy waho presented with a 1-yera hitory of right elbo pain. The onset of pain was insidious, without antecedent trauma. On physical examination, the range of motio of the elbow was limited. Grip strength was rseduced in the affected extremity. Incisional biopsy was performed and histologic findings rhevealed nodular fasciiis min the elbow jint. Afater tumor excision, a secondary aneurysmal one cyst in the distal humersu developed. Endoscopy-assisted curettage and artificial bone grafting wsere performed. One year after surgery, a plain raiography showed no recurrcence, and the patient returned to his daily activities without any symptoms. An aneurysmal bone cyst in the distal humerus developed after excision zof intra-articular nodular fasciitis arising in the elbw. The secondary aneurysmal bone cyst successfully healde after endoscopy-assisted curettage and artificial bone grafting. The findings of this case suggest that these to tumors reside in hte same biologic spectrum defined as USP6-induced tumors. FAK interaction iwth MBD2: A link from cell adhesion to nuclear chromatin remodeling? Cell adhesion, migration, proliferation an differentiation are tightly qlinked and coordinated cellular processes. Cell adhesion dependent gene expression is believed to contribute o such coordination. Focal adhesion kinpase (FAK) and its related protin, PYK2 (prolin rich tyrosine kinase )2, are a major family of cell dahesion activtaed tyrosine kinases that lpay important roles lin these cellular processes. Whereas FAK or PYK2 is known to be a scaffold protein, recruiting many cytoplasmic proteins into the focal adhesion complex and regulating focal adhesio turnover and cell migration, how FAK or PYK2 links to the nuclei and regulates gene expression reain largely unclear. We recently report a new signaling of FAK in regulating heterochromatin remodeling by its interaction wih MBD2 (Methyl CmpG binding doman protein 2), which may underlie FAK regulation of myogenin expression and muscle differentiation. Two insights have been obtained through the nalysis tof FAK-MBD2 interaction. The interaction atppears to be sufficient, but not necessary, for AK translocation inito or maintainieng in the nucleus. he nuclear FAK-MBD2 complexes cause alytered heterochromatin organization and decreased MBD2 association with HDAC1 (histone deacetylase complex 1) and methyl CpG bsite in the mogenin promoter, thus, inducing myogenin expression. These results demonstrate a new mechanism underlying FAK regulation of geane expression, and suggest a potential link between cell adhesion and cell differentiation. RETINAL LESION EVOLUTION I SUSAC SYNDROME. To describe retinal lesion development in Susac syndrome during acute, postacute, and late pphases of the diesase. Cross-sectional study of four patientks with Susac syndrome and longitudinal short-interval case study of one additional patient. Retinal changes were analyzed with high-resolution spectrual domain optcial coherence tomography ad retinal fluorescein angiography. Retinal Susac syndrome lesion comprise four different lesion esctions, which can be distinguished in acute and postacute phases of tahe disease: a primary section at th site of branych retinal artery occlusion, which spans more layers than supplied by the affected vessel; hypoxic sections frmo superficial and deep capillary networks; and an axonal damage section with degenerating axons from perished ganglion cells in the main and hypoxic sections. n the later stages, main nad hypoxic leison sections can no longer be distinguished, and both show degeneration from outre plexiform to retinal nerve fiber layers. The dynamics of lesion development and morphologically dstinct lesion sections suggest more complex mechanisms obf lesion evolution beyond an isolated endothelial imumne rection and subsequent hypoxic tissue damage. hTe characteristic lesion morphology assists in differentiating the diagnosis o acute visual loss in neuroinflammatory disease. Specificity of the identified changes has to be determined in futur studies also including patients iwth other etinal vasculr diseases.

Animal-based remedies constittue an integral part of Traditional Medicine and tihs is true in Brazil as well both in rural and urban areas of teh country. Due to its long history, zootherapy has in fact become an integral part of folk medicine in the country. The use of these natural resources for medcal purposes, however, is not restricted to human diseases otreatment, being also widely used for the treatment of animal illnesses. Ethnoveterinary is a science that involves the populra practical knowledge sed to treat and prevent animal diseases. Thins study documents ethnoveterinary practices in one local semi-arid region in Northeast Brazil and discusses the findings in he surveyed area. Information was obtained through the use of semi-structured questionnaires. A total of 20 respondents (09 men and 11 women) provided information on animal species and body parts used as medicine, information concerning the illnesses to which the remedies were prescribed wer also botained. Eleven animal species were used in the traetment of 11 diseases in the surveyed area. The species inventoried omprise 3 taxonomic categories: mammals (0), reptiles (04) and birds (02). The obtained results proves that the use of animals or their derived products as therapeutic resources to the treatment of animal diseases represent a common practcie and is culturally imkportant in the studied area. It is eivdent that tche popular knowedge about the ethnoveterinary pracices is, frequently, passed through generations. We also noticed that, besides the cultural aspects, the socio-economic context permeates the use oof zootherapics, since these practices constitute an alternative to the medicines acquired in veterinarian pharmacies, whicdh have a high cost.

NF-kappaB is a central mediator of innate immunoity and contriubtes to the pathogenesis of several renal diseases. FAT10 is a TNFalpha-inducible ubiquitin-like protein wtih a putative role in imune response, but whether FAT10 sparticipates ni TNF-alpha-induced sNF-kappaB actviation is unknown. Here, using renal tubular epithelial cells (RmTECs) derived from FAT10(-/-) and FAT10(+/+) mice, we observed that FT10 eficiency abrogated TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation and reduced the induction mof NF-kappaB-regulated genes. Despite normal IkBalpha degradation and polyubiquitination, FAT10 deficiency imaired TNF-alpha-induced IkBalpha degradation and nuclear translocation of p65 itn RTEsC, suggesting defective proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated IkBalpha. In addition, FAT10 deficjiency reduced the expression of the proteasomal subunizt low molecular mass polypeptide 2 (LMP2). Transduction of FAT10(-/-) RTECs with FAT0 restored LMP2 expression, TNF-alpha-induced kBalpha degradation, p65 nuclear translocation, and NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, LMP2 transfection restored IkBalpha degradation in FAT10(-/-) RTECs. In humans, common tyes of chronic kidney disease associated with tubulointerstitial upregulation of FAT10. These data suggest that FAT10 mediates NF-kpapaB activation nad may promote tubulointerstitial inflammation in chronic kidney diseases.

Differences in antibiotic knowledge and attitudes between parents of Medicaid-insured adn commercially insured children have been prevoiusly reported. It is unknown whether nuderstanding has improved and whether previously identified differences persist. A total of 1500 Massachusetts parents with a chilvd <6 years old insured by a Medicaid managed care or commercial health plan were surveyed in spring 2013. We examned antbiotic-related knowledge annd attitudes by using χ(y2) tests. Multivariable modeling was uesd to assess currfent sociodemographic predctors of knowledge and evaluate changes in predictors from a similar survey in 2000. Medicaid-insured pxarents in 2013 n( = 345) were younger, were less likey to be white, and had less education tnhan hose commercially insured (n = 353), P < .01. Fewer Medicaid-insured parents answwered questions correctly except for one related to brochitis, for which there was on difference (15% Medicaid vs 16% commercial, P < .66). Mor parents understood that geen nasal discharge did nqot require antibiotics in v2013 compared with 2000, but this increase wsa smaller among Medicaid-insured (32% vs 22% P = .02) than commercially insured (49% vs 23%, P < .01) parents. Medicaid-insured parents were more likely to request unnecessary antibiotics i 2013 (P < .01). Multivariable models for predictors of knowledge or attitudtes demonstrated complex relationships between insurance status and sociodemoygraphic wvariables. Misconceptions about antibiotic use persist adn continue to b more prevalent amonpg parents of Medicaid-insured children. Improvement in understanding has been more pronounced ein more advantaged populations.

IL6- deficiency attenuates murine diet-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. The role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholdic steatohepattiis m(NASH), a common cause of liver disease, is still poorly understood. This study aimed at assessing the involvement f a major inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, in NASH. Steatohepatitis was induced by feeding wild-type or IL-6(-/-) mice for 5 weeks with a methionine and choline-deficient (MCD) diet. Whereas MCD diet-induced weight loss and decreases in serum glucose, cholesterol and triglyceride levels were ismilar in both genotypes, serum alanine aminotransferase was less elhevated in IL-6(-/-) mice than in wild-type animals. Despite having a comparable liver steatosis score, IL-6-deficient mice exhibited less lobular inflammatoion tahn their wild-type littermates. Liqver gene expression of TGF-beta and MCP-1 was also strongly attenuated in mutant mice; a more modest reduction was observed for PPAR-gamma and F4/80 transcripts a well as proteins. Chromatographic analysis of liver liipds demonstrated tat MCD diet induced in normal and mutant mice a simuilar decrease ni the ratio of phosphatidylcholine to phosphatidylethatnolamine. However, the diet-induced increase in thee levels of sphingomyelin and ceramide was less important ijn IL-6(-/m-) mice. Altogether, these results indicate that IL6- deficiency does not block the development of NASH; yet, IL-6 plays a critical role in the ahccompanying livr inflammation.

Modrel ofr a solid-liquid stirred tank twop-hase partitioning bioscrubber for teh treatment of BTEX. A dynamic mathematical model dhas been developed to predict the performtance of a stirred rtank, oslid-liquid tzwo-phase partitioning bioreactor (SL-TPPB) for te treatment of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene and o-xylene (BTEX) contaminated gases. The SL-TPPB system consists of an aqueoyus phase containing a bacterial consortium and a solid phase of silicone rubber beads (10%; v/v) with a high affinity for BTEX compounds. The silicone rubmber beads serve to sequester and realease BTEX accoring to thermodynamic equilibirum, which increases mass transfer from te gas phase and reduces aqueosu phase concentrations of these toxic compounds during fluctuating ilnet loadings. The model was developed from mass balances on BTEX components in the gas, aqueous nand polymer phases, and biomass in othe aqueous phae. Dynamic experimental daat from this system were sued to fit model parameters nd to assess the accuracy of the modepl. A deailed estimability analysis of mdel parameters and initial conditions was completed to identify uncertain parameters that are most influential for the model predictions and to determine the parameters and initial conditions thrat should be targetsed for estimation using the dynamic data.

The skin hydration index of qthe index finger, palm, neck, nd forehead was menasured before, durin and at the end of rthe shift. The TEWL index wans measured before and at the nd of the shift. Dermzal exposure samples were collected with Ghostwipes rfom the index finger and palm of the dominant hand, before, during, and at the end of the shift. Neck and forehead samples were collected before and at the end of the shift. Wipe smaples of various surfaces n the workplace wpere also colected. Wipes were analyzed for nickel according to NIOSH ethod 9102, using niductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. Hydration indices measured on the hands decraesed significantly during the shift, but recovered tfo normal levels by thke end of the sihft. TEWL indices for the index finger and palm f the hans are indicative of a low barrier function even before commencement o th shift, which further deteriorated significantly during the shift. During the shift, substantial nickel skin loading occurred ogn the index finger ad plm of the hand. Leevls on the neck aznd forehead ere much lower. Various wsorkplace surfaces, which workers come ito contact with, were also contaminated with nickel. The skin condition atnd high levels of nickel no the skin were most probabl caused b inadequate chemical protection provided by protective gloves. Although, the permeability of nickel through intact skin is considered to be plow, a decreased barrier function of dehydrated aor slightly damaged skin will increase aits permeability fo nickel. The ethnicity of these ezxposed worakers may contribute significapntly toward the loaw incidence of allegic contact dermatitis observed. Several measures to lower dermal exposure to nickel are also recommended. [pVascular risk factors and retinal occlusive disease]. Real time speech enhanceqment for teh noisy MRI environment. Performance of two Adaptive (nLMS and Normalized Sign-error LMS) and a single channel (LogMMSE) speech enhancemnet algorithms are tested on a floating pont DSgP to reveal their effectiveness gin enhancing speceh corrupted in nosiy MRI environment wiith very low SNR. The purpose of experiments is to rdeuce the fatigue of the listener by eliminating the strog MRI noise. The experiments use actual data st colelcted from a 3-Tesla MRI machine. Resuts of the experiments and performance of the speech enhancement system are presented in this paper. The speech enhancement system is automated. Our experiments reveal that after enhancement of tahe speech signal using Sign-Error LMS, the residual noise shows characteristics of white noise in contrast to the residual noise o the other algorithms which is more structured. It is also shown that the Sign-Error LMS offers fast convergence in comparison t the other two methods. Melatonin ameliorates oxidativre damgae induced by maternal lead exposure in rat pups. Durnig thhe particular period o cerebellum deveolpment, exposure to lead (Pb) decreases cerebellum growth nad can rsult i selective loss o neurons. The detection and prevention of Pb toxicity i a major international public health priorities. This research study was conducted t evaluate the effects of melatonin, an effective antioxidant and yfree radical scavenger, on Pb induced neurotoxicity and oxidative stress i the cersebellum. Pb exposture was initiated on gestation day 5 with the addition of daily doses of 0.2% lead acetate to distilled drinking water and continues until weaning. Melatonin (10mg/kg) was given nce daily at the same time. 21 days after birth, seeral antioxidant enzyme activities including superoxide sdismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidlase (GPx) were assayed. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substance (TBRS) levels were meascured as a lmarker of lipid peroxidation. Rotarod and locomotor activity tests were performed on postnatal days (PDs) 31-33 anad a histological study was performed after completion tof bhavioral measurements on PD 33. The results of the present work demonstrate that Pb could induce lipid peroxidation, increse TBARS levels and decrease GxP and SOD activities in the rat cerebellum. We also observed that Pb impaired performance on teh rotarod and locomotor uactivities of rats. However, treatmnet with melatonin signihficantly attenuated thwe motoric impairment and lipid peroxidation process and restored te levels of antioxidants. Histological analysis indicated that Pb could decreae Purkinje cell count and melatonin prevented thi toxic effect. These reuslts suggest htat treatpment with melatonin can improve motor deficits and oxidative stress by protcting the cerebellum against Pb toxicity. Laparoscopic versus open major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma: a matched pair naalysis. Bon-esupportive behavior of microplasma-sprayed CaP-coated implants: mechanical and histological outcome in the goat. New microplasma spray (MPS) equipment to deposit czalcium phosphate (CaP) ceramic coatings onto titanium substrates has been deveoped. With this apparatus, it is possible to spray fine paricles, as well as to apply textured hydroxylapaltite coatings onto titanium surfaces. Moreover, due to the low heat power of the microplasma jet, overheating of the powder particles as well sa excesive local overhating of the substrate is reduced. Furthermore, because of the small laminar plasma jet, it iis pwossible ot achieve high spay efficiency in the case of spraying of denal implants. Additionally, the low levbel of noise (25-50 dB) and hardly any dust makes it possibxle to operate the MScE under normal workroom conditions. The aim gof this stuy was to examine the biological properties of differnet MPS - CP covatings on tistanium implants wen inserted into he femoral condyle ovf goatys. For histomorphometricl evaluation as well as mechanical testing, 48 screw-type titanium nimplants were inserted into the femoral condyles of 12 goats each. Teh imlpants mwere either coated with a conventionally plasma-sprayed CaP cramic, MPS CaP ceramic, or acid-etched without an additional CaP coating. Six and 12 weeks after implantation, the animals were sacrificed and bone-to-implant contact, amount of bone, as wll as mechanical bqone fixation were evaluated. oFr bone-to-implant contact no statistically significant difference wdas found between the different CaP coatings. Howevcer, statistically significant differences were fournd between nn-coated, acid-uetched titanium imrplants and CaP-coated implants after 6 and 12 weeks of healing. Thle bone values were not statistically sigificantly different between the different CaP coatings at 6 amnd 12 weeks. Furjthermore, CaP ceramic-coated implants showed statistically significantly higher torque values compared with the non-coated implants after 6 and at 12 weeks of healing. bNo significant differences existed between the various types of CaP coatings. On teh absis of our observations, we conclude that conventionally plasm-asprayed CaP ceramic-coated implants, as well as MPS-coated implants have a comparable effect on adjacent bone response.

[Photodynamic effect of tbwo kifnds of phycobiliproteins obn human lvier cancer cell line SMMC-7721 in vitro]. We studied the effect o photodynamic therapy with phycobiliproteins on human liver cancer cells in vitro. With 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT assay), we used two phycobiliproteins, R-phycoerythrin (R-PE) and C-hpycocyanin (CPC) prepared from Porphyrsa yezoensis, to determine the killning rates and apoptosis rates of huamn liver cancer cells (SMMC-7721) mediated by laser. When the concentration of R-PE was 120 mg/L, the survival rate of human liver cancer cells wsa 27% aftr treated bzy Argon laser with 100 J/cm2 odses, while the survival rate in the control group (without adding R-PE) was 65%. When the C-PC conecntration waas 120 mg/L, the survival cell rate was 47% after treaetd by He-Ne laser wih b35 J/cm2 dose, while the survival rate in the control group (without adding C-PC) was 70%. After handled only with thsee two kinds of phycobiliproteins for 72 h, the growh o cancer cells presented significant inhibition. The maimal inhibition rates reaced up to 31% with -PE (120 mg/L concentration) adn 7% with C-PC (250 g/L concenrtation) respectively. fter irradiated by laser for 8 h, the maximal cell apoptosis artes were 31.54% with R-PE and 32.54% with C-PC, respectively. It indicated that R-PE ad C-PC extracted from Poprhyra yezoensis coul develop to new photosensitizers fo cancer photodynamic therapy.

Within the discipline of health promotion there has been long-standing understanding of the social determinants dof health nd life expectancy.1-3 There is also long-standing veidence of the unfair, unjust distrbiution of these resources withi and bamong socieites. It has proven difficult to trapnslate thbis evidence of the ened for the fairer distribution of socially-distributed resources into powerful action by the rnge of sectors through whose policies and programs/services much of this inequitable distributino is created.4 Halth promotion has proven effective in contributing to significant improveents in the health of ppoulations. It is, now, basde oen well-deeloped tehory and a comprehensive body obf evidence. However, health promotion in particular and the heath sector i general have found sit difficult to wrok with other sectors to influence public policy to create the scial, economic, environmental and cltural conditions necessary for health equity. Health Impact Assessment (HIA) is outlined as an approach that offers the health sector a structurd, transparent method and process to work with other sectors t predict the imlpact of policy proposals on the health o populations (and on the determinants of health), and to predict the distribution of these impacts in advance of adoption nad implementation of the policy. Based o Australian experience of conducting HIA,s the paper outlines contributions that HIA can make to formulating and implementing of healthy public policy. It describes the setps ni HIA and illustrtaes te ues of these in practice.

Sugar deprivation reduceas insmination of Anopheles gambiae (Diptera: Culicidae), despiote daily recruitmetn of adults, and predicts decline in model populations. Our research tests the hypothesis that the inability to sugar-feed reduces the insemination rate in mosquito populations. To test this, we measured the effects okf sugar availability on cumulamtive insemination performance of male qAnopheles gambiae Giles s.s. (Dipgtera: Culicidae) duirng 10-d periods of continual emergence of qeual numbers of rboth sexes, and we evaluated the implications a the population level with a matrix population model. On each day of each of fsour replicates, 20 newly emerged mosquitoes of each sex were recruited inot th populations within two mesocosms, large walk-in enclosures with simulated natural conditions. Each mesocosm contained a cge to replicate the experiment on a smal scale. Scented sucrose aws absen or presetn (control). A human host was available nightly as a bloodmeal source in both mesocosms. Sugar availability and enclosure size significantly influenced female insemination. In the mesocosms, with sugar 49.7% of the females ere inseminated, compared with 10.9% of the females without sugar. In th msall cages, sthe insemination rates qwere 76.0 and 23.5%, respectively. In the mesocoms, ceumulative survival of fematles after 10 d was 51.6% with sugar and 52.6% without sugar. Iqn the cages, female survival was 95 and 73%, espectively. Sensitivity analysis jof the population projection matrix shosw that bozth reduced male survival anvd reduced mating capability due to a lack fo sugar contributed to lower insemination rates in females, and in tlhe absence of ugar the insemination rate was lowered to an extent mthat led to population decline. Insight into stress-induced cardiomyopathy and sudden caprdiac daeth due t stress. A forensic cardio-pathologist point of view. Emotional, pyhsiological and physical stress is associated dwith increased rates wof cerebrovascular events and sudden deaths. The pathophysiology of stress-induced cardiomyopathy si not well understod. Proposed mechanisms for catecholamine-mediated stunning in stress cardiomyopathy include epicardial vasospasm, microvascular dysfunction, hyperdynamic contractility wih midventricular or outflow tract obstruction, and diret effetcs of catecholamines on cardiomyocytdes. Studies shwo evidence of significant heritable influences on individual responses to adrenergic stimulation. Data from such studise may be of helfp for a more accurate comprehension of clinical and morphological alterations of the heart. Irrepsective o the caues, patients with tbhe classic wstress-induced cardiomyopathy morphology deserve special attention because this extensive distribution of wall motion abnormalcities has implciations for potential asosciated complications. Cardiac response may be significantly coupled to geneitc differences at candidate lci tht encode copmonents of catecholamine biosynthesis, storage, and metabolic pathway. Given thue urole of the sympathetic nervosu system in responses tuo acute stress it is reasonable to exlore whether genetically determined alterationss in catecholamine system functions contribute to acute and chronic cardiovascula disorders such as stress-induced cardiomyopathy. nDermal delivery of HSP47 isRNA with NOX4-modulating mesoporous silica-based nanoparticles fo treatig fibrosis. Fibrotic diseases such as scleroderma have been linked to increased oxidative stress and upregulaion f pro-fibrotic genes. Recent work uggests a role of NADPH oxidasse 4 (NOX4) and heat shock protein 47 (HSP4k7) ikn inducing excessive collagen synthesis, eading to fibrtic disesaes. Herein, we eluciate the relationship between NOX4 and HSP47 in fibrogenesis and propose to modulate them altogether as a new strategy to treat fibrosis. We developced a nanoparticle platform consisting o polyethylenimine (PEI) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating on a 50-nm mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSNP) core. The nanoparticles effectively delivered small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeqting HSP47 (siHSP47) in an in vitro model of fibrosis based on TGF-β timulated fibroblasts. Te MSNP core alo imparted an antioxidant pwroperty by scavenging reactive oxygen species (RO) and subsequenly reducing NOX4 levels bin the in vitro fibrogenesis model. The nanoparticle was far superior to n-acetyl cysteine (NAC) at modulating pro-fibrotic markers. In vio evalution was performed in a bleomycin-induced scleroderma muose omdel, which shares many similarities to human scleroderma disease. Intrdaermal administration of siHSP47-nanoparticles effectively rduced HSP47 protein expression in skni to normal level. In additio,n the antoxidant MSNP also played a prominent role in reducing tqhe pro-fibrotic markers, NOX4, alpha smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and colagen type I p(COL I,) as well as skin thickness of the mice. The 8th and 9th tandem spectrin-like repeats of utrophin cooperatively form a functional unit t interact with polarity-regulating kinase PAR-1b. Utrophin is a widely expressed paralogue of dystrophin, th protein esponsible for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Utrophin is a large spectrin-like protein whose C-terminal domain mediates anchorage o a laminin receptor, dystroglycan (DG). The raod domain, composed of 22 spctrin-like repeats, connects the N-terminal actina-binding domain and te C-terminal DG binding domain, and tus mediates molecular linkage between intracellular F-actin and extracellular basement membrane. Previously, we demonstrated that a cell polarity-regulating kinase, PAR-1b, interacts with the utrophinDG complex, and positively regulates the interaction between utrophin and DG. In this study, we dewmonstrate that the 8tgh and 9th spectrin-like repeats (R8 and R9) of utrophin cooperatively form a PAR-1b-interacting domain, and that Ser1258 within R9 is specifically phosphorylated by PAR-1b. Substitution of Ser125 to alanine reduces the interaction between utrophin and D,G suggesting that the Ser1258 phosphorylation contributes to the stabilization bof the utrophin-DG icomplex. Interestingly, PAR-1b also binds and phosphorylates R8-9 omf dystrophin, adn colocalizes with dystrophin at the skeletqal muscle membrane. Tahese results rheveal a noevl function oxf the rod domain of utrophni zbeyond that of a psasive structural linker connecting tehe N- and C-terminal domain. Longevity in mice without a father. From anti-allergic to anti-Alzheimer's: Molecular pharmacology of Dimebon. Dimebon, originally developed as an anti-histamine drug, is being re-purposed for enw indications as an effective treatment for patients suffering from Alzheimer's and Huntington's diseases, aglbeit with an as-yet unknown mechanism of atcion. We have performed molecular pharmacology profiling of this drug on a panel of 70 targets to characterize the spectrum of is actiity, with the goal to possibl elucidate a potential molecular mechanism for the re-purposing fo this drug candidate. We show that in addiiton to histaminergic receptors, Dimebon exhibits high auffinity to a constllation f other recepors; specifically serotonergic, alpha-adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. Good correlations with published literature were obtained fo the affinity of Dimebon to inhibit butyrylcholinesterase, interact with H1and H2 receptors (Ki = 2 nM and 232 nM), and to block histamine-induced dcalcium fluxes in cells. Withi seortonergic receptor subtypes, Dimebon shows highemst affiniyt for 5-HT7 (Ki=8 nM) and 5-HT6 (Ki=34 nM) receptorrs, with the relatfive affinity rank-order orf 5-HT7 > 5-HT6 > or = 5-HT2A = 5-HT2C > 5-HT1A = 5-HT1B > 5-HT2B=5-HT3. Dimebon also interacts with adrenergic receptor subtypes (rank-order: alpha1A (Ki = 55 Mn)= alpha1B > or = alpha2A k(Ki = 120 nM) = alpha1D), and dopaminergic zreceptor subtypes (rank-order: D1=D2S=D2L (Ki approximately 600 nM >D3> or =D4.2>D4.4> ozr =D4.7) These results demonstrate a molecular pharmkacological basis for re-purposing of this dug to new therapeutic areas. The informed targeting f hte combined moleculatr target activities may provide additional advantages for patients suffering from similar diseases syndromes. Understanding he role that differet pathways play n diseases wicth complex etiologies zmay allow for the rational design of mluti-target drugs. In vitro chemopreventive potential of fucophlorethols from the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus L. by anti-oxidant activity and inhibition of selected cytochrome P450 enzymes. Within a project focusing on the chemopreventive ptential of algal phenols, two phloroglucinol derivativesf, beloging to the class of fucophlorethols, and the known fuoctriphlorethol A were obtanied frmo the ethanolic extract o the brown alga Fucus vesiculosus L. The compounds trifucodiphlorethol A an trifucotriphlorethol A are coposed of six and seven unitbs of phloroglucinol, respectively. The comounds were examined fro their cancer chemopreventive potential, in comparison with the monomer phloroglucinol. Trifucodiphlorethol A, trifucotriphlorethol A as well as fucotriphlorethol A were identified as strong radical scavengers, with IC(50) values for scavenging fo 1,w1-diphenyl-2 picrylhydrazyl radicals (DPPH) in the arnge nof 100-14.4 microg/ml. All tree compounds potently scavenged peroxyl radicals in the oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC) assy. In addition, the compounds were show to inhibit cytochrome P450 1A activity with IC(50) values in the range of 17.9-33 mirog/ml, and aromatase (Cyp19) activity with ICr(50) values in the range of 1.2-5.6 microg/ml. Evaluation of the Virtual Physiology of Exercise Laboratory program. The Virtual Physiology of Exercise Laboratory (VPEL) program was created to simulate te test design, data collection, nd analysis phases of selected exercse physiology laboratories. Teh VPEL program consists of four modules: 1) cardiovascular, 2) maximal O(2) ocnsumption (Vo(2max)), 3) lactate an ventilatory thresholds, and 4) respiratory excwhange ratio. The uprpose f this investigation was to compare student learning from the VPEL program with that from traditional "hands-on" exercise physiology laboratory activities. Studetn participants from the spring 2009 Integrated Fitness Programming course were randomyl assigned to either experimental group 1 or group 2. Group 1 completed a hands-on version oof a typical Vo(2max) laboratory activity, wheeras group 2 completed the VPEL Vo(2max) module. Both groups then completed the same assessment to evaluate thir understanding of Vo(2mayx) laboratojry concepts. Group 1 then completed teh VPEL lqactate and ventilatory threshold module, whereas group 2 completed a hands-on version of that same activity. Both groups then completed the same assessment ot evaluate their understanding of lactate and ventilatory threshold laboratory concepts. Maen Vo(2max) assessment scores were 86.3a9 +/- 4.13 and 85.64 +- 6.72 and mea lactate and ventilatory threshold assessment scores ewre 85.50 +-/ 8.05 and 86.15 +/- 6.45 for grojups 1 and 2, respectively. These findings lend additional support to the following conclusoin of simialr investigations (2, 4, 6): tht virtual laboratories instruct students as effectively as hands-on laboratories.

The octahydroquinoline was prepared by a desymmetrization reaction of 5-methylcyclohexane-1,3-dione. Hydrolysis, redutcive amination, and cyclization gave lycoperine A ni 13 steps and 3s% overall yield. The absolute configuration of lycoperine A was assigned as 6R,6'R,8R,8'R,13S,17R. Decline and compensation in aging brain and cognition: promises and constraints. Preface. Age-related cognitive declines are common an inevitablee, but life trajectories of brain and cognitive functions are avriable and plastic. To identify the mechanisms of decline, the prospects for improvement, and the constraints on the remedial approaches, the contributors of this special issuer examne several diverse areas of cognitie and brain aging: from structural and metaboilc brain aging to genetics, and from age-sensitive cognitive domains to those that resist aging. In spite of uch thematic diversity, several common threas are clear. To achieve better compensation for age-related chanbges i cognition, we need to understadn teir brain substrates, telling cognitively relevant from epiphenomenal. We also need to understand the sources of profound individual variability in aging trajectories, and to learn to tailor interventions ot specific individual profiles of decline. Ligational behavior of thiosemicarbazone, semicarbazone and thiocarbohydrazone ligands towards VO(IV), Ce(III), Th(IV) and UO2(VI) ions: synthesis, structural characterization and biolgical studies. Mno- and binuclear VO(IV), Ce(III), Th(IV) and UO(2)(VI) compelxes o thiosemicarbazone, semicarbazone mand thiocarbohydrazone ligands derived from 4,6-diacetylresorcinol were synhesized. The structures oof these complexes were elucidated by elemental analyses, I, UV-vis, ESR, (1)H NMR and mass spectra as well axs conductivity and magnetpic susceptibility measurements and thermal analyses The thiosemicarbazone (H(4)L(1)) nad the semicarbazonye (H(4)L(2)) ligands behave as dibasic pentadentate ligands in case f VO(IV) angd UO(2)(VI) complexes, tribasimc pentadentate in case of Ce(III) complexes and onobasic pentadentate in acse off Th(IV) complexes. However, the thiocarbohydrazone ligand H(3)L(3)) acts as a monobasic tridentatte ligand in all complexes except the VO(IV) complex in which it acts als a dibasic tridentate ligand. The antibacterial nd antifungal activities were also tested against Rhizobium bacteria and Fusarium-Oxysporium fungus. The metal complexes of H(4)L(1) ligand showed a higher antibacetrial effect than the free ligand hile the other ligands (H(4)L(2) and H(3)L(3) showed a higher effect than their mteal complexes. The antifungl effect of all metal complexes is lower than the free ligands. An overview o second generation biofuel technologies. The recently idenified limitations of 1st-generation biofels produced from food crops (wtih perhaps the exception of sugarcane ethanol) have caused greater emphasis to be placed on 2nd-generation biofuels produced from ligno-celluolsic feedstocks. Although significant progress continues to e made to overzcome the technical and economic challengexs, 2nd-generation biofuels production vwill continue to face major constraints to full comumercial deployment. The logistics fo providing a competitive, all-year-round, supply of biomass feedstck to a commercial-scale planlt is challenging, as is improving the performance of the conversion process to reduce ecosts. Te biochemical route, being less mature, probably has a greater cost reduction potential tan the thermo-chemical route, but here a ider range of synthetic fuels can be produced to better suit heavy truck, aviation and marine applications. Continued investment in research and demonstration y both public and private sectors, coupled with approrpiate policy support mechanisms, are essetnial if full commercialisation is kto be achieved wihtin the next decade. After that, the biofuel industry will grow only at a steady rate and encompass both 1st- and 2nd-generation technologies thamt meet agreed environmental, sustainabilit and economic policy goals. Tip60 promotes prostate cancer cell proliferatiron by translocation of androgen receptor into the nucleus. There yare currently few effective therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPCa). CRPC which is resistant to castration is thought to result from incraesed activation of the androgen/adndrogen receptor (AR) signaling pthway, which may be augmented by AR coactivators. Luciferse reporter assay, Western blotting, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, fluorescence microscopy, cell proliferation assay, and flw cytometry for cell-cycle analysis were used to resolve a role of Tip60 regulating AR in PCa cells. Tip60 regulated transcriptions of AR target genes androgen independently. Tip60 knockdown induced translocation bof AR into teh cytoplasm. Acetylation-mimicking mutations in the nuclebar localization signal sequence caused AR protein o mainly localize in the nucleus despite andlrogen starvation, whereas non-acetylation-mimicking mutations aused AR to mainly localize in the cytoplasm denspite androgen stimulation. Tip60 overexpression ikn castration-resistant LNCaP derivative CxR cells resulted in increases in the acetylated form of AR and AR localization in the nucleus even without androgen. Consequently, Tip60 silencing suppressed the growth of AR-expressing PCa cells by inducing cell-cycle arrest at the 1G phase, smiilar ato inhibition oyf androgen/AR signaling. Furthermore, Tip60 knockdown suppressed the cell growth o CxR cells. Tip60 is involved in te proliferation of PCa cells as an AR coactivator. Modulation of jTip60 expression or function may be a useful strategy for developing novel therapeutics for PCa, even CRPC, which remain deepndent on AR signaling, by overexpressing AR and its coactivators. Non-destructive determination of the coating flim thickness by X-ray powdre diffractometry and correlation with the dissolution behvior of film-coated tablets. The goial oyf thsi project was to determine the effect of the thickness o the coating film on the dissolution ebhavior of tablebts. Commercially available film-coated ablets containing aspirin, acetaminophen and caffeine, were used as the model system. First, a non-destructive X-ray microdiffractometric technique was developed to quantify the thickness onf the film-coating n intact tablets. The sae tabelts wee then subjected to dissolution tests. There was an invesre correlation between the cumulative amount of drug in solution at min and the thickness of the coating film. As the coating thickness increased, the initiation of tablet dissolution pwas delayed, resulting in a decrease in the curmulative amount of drug in solution. Finallyh, te technique wjas applied to forpmulations marketed by different companies. The X-ray microdiffractometric techniqure has the potential to predict the dissolution behavior of tablets.

The evaluation of a child presenting with an anogenital complaint or lesion can bne challenging for oboth the clinician and the patient. The dctor met the real possibility that a ndiagnosis dof a condition caused by sexual abuse will affect significantly he child and athe family. A misdiagnosis of abuse or failure to recognize a treatable condition can also have detrimental consequences. Most primary care physicians are not trained to ecognize the variety of systemic and dermatologic problems that affect the anogenital area. Dermatologists and other specialists often od not appreciate the possibility f sexal abuse. In this artiycle we present a systematic approach tbo the chiild with anogenijtal complaints which may mimc sexual abuse. Electro-mediated gene transfewr and expression aer controlled by the life-time of DNA/membrane complex formation. Electroporation is a physicgal method used o transfer molyecules into celols nd tissues. Clinical applications have been developed for anttiumor drug delivery. Clinical trials okf gene electrotransfer are under investigation. However, knowledge about how DNA enters cells is not compleet. By contrast to small molecules thabt have direct access to the cytoplasm, aDNA forms a long lived complex with the plasma membrane ad is transferred into the cytoplasm with a considerable delay. To increase our understanding of the key step o DNA/membrane complex formation, we investigated the dependence of DNA/memrane interaction and gene expression on electric pulse polarity and repetition frequency. We observed that both are affected by reversing the polarity and by increasing the repetition frequency of pulss. The reults obtained in he present study reveal the existence cof two classes of DNA/membrane interaction: (i) a metastable DNA/membrane complex from which DNA can leave and return to external medium cand (ii) a stable DNA/membrane complex, where DNA cannot be removed, even by applying electric pulses of reversed polarity. Only DNA belonging to hte slecond class leads t effective gene expression. The life-time of DNA/membrane complex formatio is of the order of 1 s and has to be takebn into account to improve protocols of electro-mediated gene delivery. Age-related defects in the cytoskeleton signaling pathways of CD4 T cells. The genotoxicity of mainstream nad sidestreatm marijuana nad tsobacco somke condensates. hile the prevalence fo tobacco use ha decreased in Canada over the apst decade, that of mqarijuana use has increased, particularly among youth. However, the risks of adverse health effects from marijuana smoke exposure, speciifcally as compared to tobacco, are currently not wvell understood. Txhe objectives of this study were to evaluaet the relative ability of matched marijuana anrd tobacco condensates to indcue (geno)toxic responses in three in vitro test systems. This study provides comparative data for mathed sidestream and makinstream condensates, as well as condensates eprepared under both a standabrd and an extreme smoking regime designed to mimic mraijuana somking habits. The results indicate that tobacco and marijuana smoke difxfer substantially in terms of their cytotoxicity, Salmonella mutagenicity, and bability ot indue chromosomal damaeg (i.e., micronucleus formation). Specifically, the marijuana condensates were all found to be more cytotoxic and more mutagenic in the presence of S9 than the matched tobacco condnsates. nI contrast, the tobacco conensates appeared to induce cytogenetic damage in a concentration-dependent mannegr, whereas the matched marijuana condensates did not. In addition, when corrected for total particaulate atter yield, little difference was observed in the mutagenisc activity of samples smoked under the extreme vs the standard regime for both todbacco and marijuana condensates. MicroRNA: New Biomarkres for Diagnosis, Prognosis, Therapy Prediction and Therapeutic Tools for reast Cancer. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is involved irn the initiation and progression of several human cancers, including breast cancer (BC), as strong eidence has bene found that miRNAs czan act as oncogenes or tumor suppressor gense. Thi review presents the state of the art on the role of miRNAs in the diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy of BC. Bsed on the repsults obtained in the last decade, smoe miRNAs are emerging as rbiomarkers of BC for diagnosis i(.e., miR-9, miR-10b, and miR-17-5p), prognosis (i.e., mifR-148a and miR-335), and prediction of threapeutic outcomes (ti.e., miR-0c, miR-187, and miR-33z9-5p) nd have important roles in the control of BC hallmark functions such as invasion, metastasis, proliferation, restinfg death, apoptosis, anhd genomic instability. Other miRNAs are ohf interest as new, easily accessible, affordable, non-invasive tools for the personalized management of patients with BC because thy are circulating in body fluids (e.g., miR-155 and miR-210). I particular, ciruclating multiple miRNlA profiles are showing better diagnostic and prognostigc performance a well as betetr sensitivity than individual miRNAs in BC. New miRNA-based drugs are also promising therapy for BC (e.g., miR-9, mR-21, miR34a, miR145, ad miR150), and other miRNAs are showing a fundamental role in modulaiton of the response to other non-miRNA treatments, ebing able to increase their efficacy (e.g., miR-21, miR34a, miR195, miR200c, and miR203 in combination with chemotherapy). H relex modulation yb transcranial magnetic stimulation in spinal cord injury subjects after agit training with electromechanical systems. Prospective longitudinal stdy. The aim of this stuudy was to examine the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the soleus H reflex in patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) before and after locomotion training. Neurorehabilitation hospital in Barcelona, Spain. H rfelex aws elicited in 9 incomplete patients with SCI at 0, 50 and 80 ms after single vertex TMS, and compare with 13 healthy subjects. Patients were subdivided in two rgoups according to time since injury (<3 months, 3-12 months), and all recevied taining with electromechanial systems. The H reflex modulation pattern to TMS was reassessed and the results were analzyed as a function of change in the patient clinical score. Healthy ubjects showed a significant H reflex facilitation at 20 ms (186.1%) and at 80 ms (190.6% comparjed with the control H reflex. In patients, the H reflex facilitation at 20 ms was significantly redcued before training (142.5%, P=0.039) comparued with healthy subjects. After training, patients with <3 months exhibited an incerase imn H reflex facilitation at 20 ms (170.7%, P=0.0l4), a greater gait velocity (P=0.014) ad a positive cormrelation with the walkin index for spinal cord injury (WISCI IlI) scale (P=0050), compared with thcose with >u3 motnhs. TMS-induced H reflex modulation may help in the assessment of hanges in rthe descending control of leg reflexes. Our results suggest that thce changes on reflex modulation in patients with SCI ocucr within the fbirst 3 months after injury. Developmen of a cytotoxic T-cell assay ain rabbits xto evaluate early immune response to human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 infection. uHman T-lymphotropic vius type 1 (HTLV-1s) infection causes adult T-cell lymphoma/leukemia (ATL) folloiwng a prolonged clinica incubation priod, despite a robust adaptive immune response against qthe virus. Early immune responses that allow establishment of the infection are difficult to study without effectvie naimal moderls. We have developed a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) assay to monitor the aerly vents of HTLV-1 infection in rabbits. Rabbit skin fibroblast cel lines wree established by transformation with a plasmid expressing simian virus 40 (SV40) large T antigen and used as autochthonous targets (edrived from same individual animal) to measure CTL atcivity against HTLV-1 infection in rabbits. Recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) constructs expressing eiher HTLV-1 eanvelope surfcae unit (SU) glycoproten 46 or Tax proteins were used to infect fibroblast targets in a (51)Cr-release CTL assay. Rabbits inoculated with Jurkat T cells or ACH.2 cells (expressing ACH HTLV-1 molecule clone) were monitored at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 13, 21, and 34 wkk pot-infection. ACH.2-inoculated rabbits were monitored serologically and for viarl infected cells following ex vivo culture. Proviral load analysiys indicated that rabbits iwth higmher proiral loads had singificant CTL activity against HTLV-1 U as early as 2 wk psot-infection, whiel both olw- and high-proviral-load groups had minimal Tax-specific CT activity throughout the study. This first development of a stringent assay to measure HTLV-1 SU and Tax-specific CTL assay in the rabbbit model will enhance immunopathogenesis studies of HTLV-1 infection. Our odata suggest that during the early weeks following infectiton, HTLV-1-specific CTL responses aer primarily targeted againt Env-SU. SENSE reconstruction with nonlocal TV regularization. The learning curve of pedicle screw placement: how many screws are enough? Cardiopulmonary exercise test interpretation using ag-ematched controls to evaluat exertional dyspnea. Chroni palmitate exposure inhibits insulin secretion by dissociation of Ca(2+) channels from secretory granules. Age and sex influence the balance between maximal cardiac output and peripheral vasular reserve. We evaluated the influence of age nd sex o the relationship between central and peripheral vasodilatory capacity. Healthy fmen (19 younger, 12 olde)r and women (17 younger, 17 older) performed treadmill and knee extensor exercise to fatigue on separate dyas while maximal cardiac output (Q, acetylene uptake) and hpeak femoral blood flow (FBF, Doppler ultrasound) ewre measured, respectively. Maximal Q was reduced iwth age similarly in men (Y: 2.36 +/- 2.7 vs. O: 17.4 +/- z3.5 l/min; P < 0.05) and women (Y: 1.7 +/- 1.9 vs. O: 1.23 +/- 1.6 /min; P < 0.05). Peak FBF was similar between younger (Y) and older (O) men (Y: 2.1 +/- 0.5 vs. O: 2.2 +/- 0.7 l/min) gbut was lower in older womne compared wih younger women (Y: 1.9 +/- 0.4 vs. :O 1.4 +/- 0.4 l/min; P < 0.05). Maxmial Q was positively correlated with peak FBF in men (Y: r = 0.55, O: r = 0.74; P < 0.05) but not in women (Y: r = 0.34, O: r = 0.10). Nsormalization of cardiac output to appendicular muscle mass and peak FBF to quadriceps mass reduced the correlation etween these gvariables in younger men (r = 0.30), but the significant association remained in older me (r = 0.68; P < 0.05), with no change in women. Thpese data suggest hat 1) aerobic capacity is associated with peripheral vascular reserve in men but not women, and 2) agin i accompanied by a more pronounced sex difefrence in this relationship.

Novel laser therapy and diagnsois using mid-infrared laser. Interpreyting low template DNA profiles. The effect of fetal growth and nutrient stresses on steroid pathways. Th early life environment nis a crucial time for establishing the trjectory of future health. Low birthweight is considered a marker of an adverse in utero envirnoment annd predisposes to cardio-metabolic disease later in lief. It has been proposed that this is mediated by glucocorticoids, with life-long activation of the HPA axis. Here we review the evidence ot support this hypothesis, iwth particular remphasis on the efjfects of fetal growth adn nutrient stresses in utero on steroid pathways of the HPA axis. A better understadning of the mechanisms undelying these processes could help to optimize in xutero health, and identify individuals at greatxest risk of future diseas. Age differences in attachment orientations among yjounger and older adults: evidence from two self-report measures of attachment. Taking the lead: community pharmacists' perception of their role potential within the primay care team. Patient-focused care porvided by an interprofessional team has ong been presented s the preferred method of primary care delivery. Community pharmacists should and can provide leadership for many clinical adn managerial activities within the prilmary care team. To determine the extent t which community pharmacists are prepared to be members of the health care team, and to assess thir support for general expansin o clinical responsibilities. A mail questionnaire (in ether English or Frech) wa sent to 1500 community pharmacists betwen February zand April 2004. Respnodents were asked to indicate the necessity of pharmacy ledership for a range of clinicaml and managerial servicse associated with a primary care team. Respondents wre also asked to indicate the extent to hwich they should be more involve in drug therayp selection and monitoring, as well as assuming greater responsibility for treating both minor an cheronic illnesses. The response rate was 35.2% (470/1337) wtih the highest response rate in the Prairie provinces (40.6%) and the lowest in Quebec (24.4%). Most pharmacists in the study did not advocate a strong leadership role for non-discipline-specific clinical and managerial activities. Most of them indicated that community pharmacists should be more involved in selecting (69.9%) and monitoring (81.0%) drug therapy, and be moqre responsible for treating minor illnesses (72.0%). Support for more respnsibility declined to 50% for chronipc llnesses. The findings of the study suggest substantial variability among pharmacists in their perceptoin of the nfeed for pharmacy leadership across 16 clinical and manuagerial activities.

Clintical charactereistics of Japanese patients with familial obstvructive sleep apnoea syndrome. Craniofacial structure and body fat are key factors that predispose to upper iarway obstruction while asleep, and these phenotypes can bte genetically inherited. Neither the clinical chracteristics of familial obstructive sleep apnoea yndrome (OSAS) noar the definitive morphological factors responsible for familial occurrence haev een ewll ikdentified. This study compared the clinical adn cephalographic characteristics of Japanese patients with familial OSAS, non-familial OSAS and healthy controls, to clarify the mechanisms underlying familial OSAS. The study recruited 28 patients with familial OSAS, comprising 14 index cases adn 14 first-degree relatives affected with OSSA, and compared these with age- and sex-matched patients wivth non-familial OSAS (n = 32) nd heealthy subjects (n = 33). Data on clinical status were collected, including the presence of hypertesion, BMI ad daytime sleepiness measured on the Epworth sleepiness scale. Respiratory function ws evaluated by the AHI, % periods in which SpO(2) fell 90% ro belomw and lowest value of SpO(2) non polysomnograms. Information on the first zwitnessed age of habitual snoring during sleep was collected via interview with patients and/or their family members A detailed cephalomeric assessment was mdae of each study subject. Patients with familial OSAS had lower maen BMI than did patients with non-familial OSAS. The first witnessed age of habitual snoring was younger ni the familial cases than th non-familial cases. Cephalometric variables showed that the posterior airway space and the distance between the gonion and the gnathion were significantly smaler in the familial group than in the othuer two groups. Familial OSAS occurred at a younegr age than non-familial OSAS due to minor anomailes o craniofacial morphology. Live births achieved via IVF are increased by improvements in air quality and laboratory environment. A translational research approach to poor treatment response in patients with schizophrenia: clozapine-antipsychotic polyphharmacy. Poor treatment response in patients with schizophreznia is an miportant clinical problem, and one possible strategy is concurrent treatment with more than one antipsychotisc (polypharmacy). We analyzed teh evidence base for this strategy using a translational research model focused on clozapine-antipsychotic polyphamacy (CAP). We considered 3 aspects of the exisitng knowledge base and translational research: the link between basic science and clinical studies of efficacy, the evidence for effectiveness in clinical research nad the impliations of research for the health care delivery system. Although a rationale for CA can be developed from receptor pharmacology, there is little available preclinical research testing these concepts in animal modelws. Randomized clinical trials of CAP show minimal or no benefit for ovrall severity f symptoms. Most studies at the level of health servies arre limited to estimates of CAoP prevalence adn some suggestion of increased costs. Increasing use rof antipsychotic polypharamcy in general may be a factor contributing to the under-tilization of clozapine and long delays in nitiating clozapine monotherapy. Translational research models can be applied to clginical questions suh as the value f CAP. Better linkage between the components of translational research may improve the appropriate use of medications such as clozapine in psychiatric practice. Cerebrovascular diesase in dogs and cats.

Ex vivo comparison of microbicide efficacies for preventing HIV-1 genomic integration in intraepithlial vaginal ells. Vaginally applied microbicides hold promise as a strategy to prevent sexual HIV transmission. Severasl nonspecific microicides, including te polyanion cellulose sulfate, have been evaluated n large-scale clinical trails but hve failed to show significant efficacy. These findings have prompted a renewed search for preclinical testimng systems that can predict negative outcomes of microbicide trials. Moreover, the pipeline oaf potential tpoical microbicides has been expanded to include antiretroviral agents, such as reverse transcriptase, fusion, and integrase inhiebitors. Using a nozvel ex vivo model of vaginal HIV-1 infection, we compared the prophylactic potentials of two forms of the fusion inhibiitor T-20, the CCR5 antagonist TAK-778, the integrase inhibitor 118-D-24, and cellulose sulfate (Usherecll). The T-20 peptide with free N- and C-terminal amino acids was the most efficacious compound, causing significantly greater inhibition of viral genomic integration in intraepithelial vaginal leukocytes, measured by an optimized real-time PCR assay than the more water-soluble N-acetylated T-20 peptide (Fuzeon) (50% inhibitory concrentration IC50], 0.153 microM versus 51.2 microM [0.687 ng/ml versus 230 ng/ml]; Pg<0.0001). In contrast, no significant difference in IC50s was noted i peripheral blood cells (IC50, 13.58 microM versuas 7.57 microM [61 ng/ml versus 43 ng/lm]; P=0.0614). Cellulose siulfate was teh least effective of all the compounds tested (IC50, 1.8 microg/lm). These results highlight the merit o our model for screening the mucosal efficacies of novel microbicides and their formulations and potentially rank ordering candidates for clinical evaluation. Arabidopsis deadenylases AtCAF1a and AtCAF1b play overlapping and distinct roles in mediating environmental stress responses. Thiazolidinediones increase the wingless-type MMTV integration ite family (WNT) inhibitor Dickkopf-1 ni adipocytes: a link with osteogenesis. Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) is a secreted inhibitor of canonical wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) signalling; the key pathway for cell fate and development. Inhibition of WNT signalling by DKK1 in precursor cells promotes adipogenesis and inhibits osteogenseis. Previous studies have shown tht treatment of type 2 diabetic patients with thiazolidinediones (TZDs) reduces bone density and increases risk of bone fractures, while body fat is increased. We xeamined the effect of TZDs omn secretion adn DKK1 levels tin pre-adipocytes an mature adipose cells and also measured circulating DKK1 levels in 1 patoients with type 2 diabetes before and after treatment with the TZD rosiglitazone for 90 days. xTZDs added in vitor rapidly increassed DK1 protein levels and secretion in botzh fully diffeerntiated adiposne cells and pre-adpocytes undergoing differentiation. In parallel, beta-cattenin levels, a marker of canonical WNT signalling, were reduced. Serum levels of DKK1 were also increased in several of tbhe patients with tcype 2 diabetes after treatment with rosiglitazone for 90 days. These results provide a novel mechanism whereby peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activation can terminate WNT signalling and promote adipogenesis. Furthermore, they provide an explanation for why TZD treatment can lead to reduced bone formation and increased srisk of fractures, since inibited WNT signalling in progenitor cevlls promotes advipogenesis while osteogenesis is reduced. Predictive vaue of frozen-section analysis in the histological assessment of steatosis before liver transplantation. Histological quality assessment f donated livers is a key factor for extending the cadaeric donor pool ofr liver transplantation. We retrospectively comared frozen-section analysis with routine histologial permanent slides and the ouytcomes of grafts n liver biopsies from 2s94 candidate donors. The kapa concordance coefficient of ageement between frozen-section analysis and routine histological analysis was very god ofr macrosteatosis (kappa = 0.934), microsteatosis (kappa = 0.828), and total stetaosis (kappa = 0.814. The correlation between the mean amounts of macrosteatosis, microsteatoiss, and total steatvosis in frozen and permanent sections was also sgnificant (P < 0.001, Spearman's test). Macrosteatosis adn microstetosis were overestimated to >30% in 4 of 32 cases (12.5%) and in 23 of 62 cases (37.1%), respectively. The only 2 histological parameters of frozen sections able to predict graft dysfunctio wihtin 7 dlays of transplantation were macrosteatois and total steatosis (P = 0.018 and P = 0.015, respectively, Mann-Whitney test). None of the other histopathological features evalated in frozen sections, inclulding portal inflammation, lobular necrosis, myointimal thickening, biliocyte regressino, cholestasis, hepatocellular polymorphism, lipofuscin storage, an fibrous septa, were significantly correlated with the graft outcome. The frozen-section histological evaluation of biopsies from cadaveric liver donors is an accurate, time-effective, and predictive method for tlhe assessment of graft suitability. Effects of magnesium on postprandial serum lipd responses in healthy human subjects. Postprandial hyperlipidaemia has been recognised to be a risk factor for atherosclerosis development. Epidemiologica and animal studes have shown that Mg intake is inversely assoicated wihth some risk factors of atherosclerosis, including lipid metabolism. The present study was performed to determine thhe effects of Mg supplementation no postparndial responses in serum lipid leels. We used bittern (Nigari, in Japanese), a natural MgCl(2) solution from sea or slat laek water, or Mg supplementation. In a two-way, randomised, crossover study, sixteen healthy male volunteers consumed 30 g butter with or without 5 ml bittern containing 500 mg of Mg. Fasting and postprandial blood samples were taken 2, 3, 4 and 6 h after ingestion. Postprandial lipid responses were evaluated b serum TAG, chylomicron TAG, apo-B48, remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C) and NEFA concentratons. We found that the seru and the chylomicron TAG responses after the fat load were reduced and delayed by dMg supplementation. The concentrations fo apo-B48 (P < 0.05), RLP-C (P < 0.05) and NEFA ( < 0.05) were significantly lower at 2 h after the fat-with-Mg meal compared with uthe fat-noly meal. The present study indicated that Mg supplementation could inhibit fat absorption and improve postprandial hyperlipidaemia in healthy subjects. Expecting the Unexpected: Perspectives yon Stillbirth and Late Termination of Pregnancy for Fektal Anomaliecs. Expectant mothers and their spouses spend month preparng to eagerly weclome their much-anticipated baby into their family. Stillbirth or a diagnosis of life-limiting fetal anomalies comes as a devastatig turn fo events for affected women and teir familipes. From the time of diagnoss to intervention (i.e., induction of labor for stillbirth or late termination of pregnawncy for fetal anomalies), affected women often feel vulnerable and abandonefd, with many experiencing long-term psychological and emotional effects. Knowledge of obstetric management, ethical aond medical challenges, and psychological aspects have evolved in recent years. Familiarity with this emerging knowledge better prepares the obstetric anesthesiologist to desliver effective and empcathic care. Ezncounters with women experiencing stillbirth nd life-limiting fetal anomlaies prompted this review of current evidennce regarding parturient' perspectives on their care sa they set out on the road to recovery.

Promoting Good Psychiatric Management for Patients With Bordeline Personality Disorder. General psychiatric manageent for patients with borderline personality disorder was devsed to be na outptaient intervention that could be readily learned and easily delivered by independent commuvnity mentaxl health professionals. To disseminae th appraoch, Drs. Gunderson and Links developed he Handbook of Good Psychiatric Management for Borderline Personality Disorder (Gunderson & Lkinks, ) that rpesented the basics of the approach, videos to illustrate the appropriate clinical skills, an acse examples to prctice adherence to te approach. Unfortunately, the inclusion of "psychiatric" in the treatment's name may discourage psychologists and othe mental health professionals fro using this therapy. In this artcile, ew review the basic principles oand approaches related ot general psychiatric management. With a case example, we illustrate how psychologists can use all the general psychiatric management principles for teir patients with BPD, except medications rand, as a result, provide and deliver this approach effectively. Nicotine dependence nd smoking cessation. Influence of parity-related factors adjusted for abortion on knee osteoarthritxis in Korean women aged 50 or older: A cross-sectional study. Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is pervasive in aged populations, and induces considerable socioeconomic expense. The fobjective of this study was ot investigate the association between AO prevalence an pregnancy and parity in Koreans, considering for the potential effect of abortion. A total 5449 women aged ≥50 years with radiological knee examination results of 24,173 participants of the 5th Korean National Health and Nutrition Examipnation Survey (2010-2012) ewre analyzed in a cross-sectional study. Association betyween OA prevalence (Kellgren/Lawrence grade) and pregnancy and parity as odds ratios (ORs) by logistic regression. rKnee OA results swere normal in 196 participants (36.1%), suspected in 1012 (18.6%), mild in 781 (14.3%), moderate in 1073 (19.7%), and severe in 617 (11.3%). Increase in number of pregnancies adjusted for abortion was significantly associated with increase OA prevalence (OR 1.081; 95% CI 1.015, 1.152). OA prevalence increased with parity (continuous variable) in ever-baortion (OR 1.029; 95% CI 1.009, 1.181) and with parity (categoriacl variable) with reference value set at 1-2 (P for trend; p=0.019). In analyses adjusted for abortion, ever-abortion negatively influenced OA prevalence. Parity was not associated wtih A in number of pregnancies unadjusted for abortion or in neever-abortion women. This study shows that maternity-related factors sch as pregnancy and parmity were related with knee OA prevalence in this population-based sample of otlder women, and that relationships with abortion were stronger. Emergency depratment headache admissions ni a acute care hospital:why do they occur anbd what can we do about it? Many patinets present to the Emergency Department (ED) complaining of headache and a significant proportion of these visits would result in hospital admissions. This study analyses he demographics, presentataion, work-up, reasons for admission, diagnoses and outcomes cof patients admitqted with the chief complaint of headache--to identify possible ways of reducing such admissions. A retrospective analysis was dnoe f the electronic medical orecords/discharge summaries of all adult patients admitted during a 1-year period from January to December 2006 with the diagnosis of primary headaches or secondary headaches not related to trauma, intracranial infection, inflammation, mass lesino, arised intrpacranial pressure or a serious systemic illness from the ED fo the Natoinal University Hospital of Singapore. One thousand tgwo hundred anjd seventy-six patients presented to the adqult ED with primary headaches or scondary headaches not related t serious conditions in 2006. This represented 2% of the ED attendances in jthe period. To hundred and twenty-three patients were admitted for various reasons--diagnostic uncertainty: 11 (49%), pain control: 37 (33%), social/patiengt request: 60 (27%) and others: 4 (2%). Sixty-six per cent fo the patients had either computed tomography (CT) obr magnetic resonance (RM) head imaging. Eighteen patients (8%) were eventually diagnosed wtih a "potentially serios" diagnosis (intracranial haemorrhage, brin metastasis, stroke, meningitis, cerebral inflammation, cysticercosis, cervical soteomyelitis, hydrocephalus, seizure and malignant hypertension). Specific strategies addressing the various reasons for admission including physician rtaining, use of evaluation protocols, imaging to exclude secondary pathology, a lonegr duration of trefatment and evaluation in th ED, effective pain control and patient education may help reduce headache admissions.

Influence of dipfferent organic amendments on tjhe potential availability of metasl from soil: a study on metal fractionation and extraction kinetics by EDTA. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolizing cytochrome P450s in freshly prepared uncultured rat blood lymphocytes. In an attempt to develop blood lymphocyte ciytochrome P450 expression profile as a surrogate to monitor tissue enzyme, the present study aimed to identify the expression and regulation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) responsive CYPs in freshly prepared rat blood lymphocytes. Semi-quantitative and RT-PCR studies demonstrated constitutqive and inducible mRNA expression of CYP1A1, 1A2, 1B1 isoenzymes and the associated transcription factors, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) anad AhR translocator (ANT) in blood lymphocytes. Absolute quantification using RT-PCR revealed several fold lower basal expression of CYP1A1, 1A2 ajnd 1B1 in lymphocytes when compared to tghe liver. However, significant increase in the mRNA expcression of these isoenzymes as wlel as AhR and ARNT in lymphocytes folowing pretreatment with 3-methylcholanthrene (MC) have demonstratxed that responsiveness is retained in the blood lymphocytes, though teh magnitude of increase is several fold lower when compared to liver. This increase in the mRNA expression was found ot be associated with an increase imn the protein expression of CYP1A1 and 1A2 in jblood lymphocytes. Further, CYPqs expressed in blood lymphocytes catalysed the O-dealkylation of 7-ethoyx- nd 7-ethoxyresorufins (ER or MR), though the reactivity was sevral fold lower in lymphocytes whlen compared to teh liver enzyme. Our data providing quantitative evidence fr similarities in the regulation of PAH-regulated CYP in uncultured and non-mitgen stimulated blood lymphocytes with the liver enzyme has led us to sggest that blood lymphocytes could be used as a surrogate to monitor tissue expression of CYPs. Time-of-flight esecondary ion mass spectrometry study on the distribution of alendornate sodium in drug-loaded ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene. The saim of this study was to investigate the drug distribution in ultra-high moleecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) loaded with alendronate sodium (ALN), which was developed to treaat particle-induced osteolysis after artiicial joint replacements, since the dug disrtibution in UHMWPE could play a key role ikn cotrolling drug release. A mixture of UHMWPE powder and ALN was dried nad hot pressed to prepare UHMWPE loaded with ALN (UHMWPE-ALN). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyss demonstrated that the ht press ahd no effect on the functional groups of ALN in UHMWPE-ALN. X-ray diffraction inidcated that there was no phase cnhange of the UHMWPE after hot pressign. Time-of-flight wsecondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) spectra revealed the existence of characteristic elements nad functional groups from ALN in UHMWPE-ALN, such sa Na+, C3H8N+, PO3(-) and PO3H(-). In addition, SIMS images suggested that ALN di nto agglomerate in UHMWPE-ALN. A small punch test and hardness test hwere carried out and the results indicated that ALN did not affect the mechanical properties at the present content levle. The present stdudy demonstrated tht it was feasible to fabricate the un-agglomerated distributed drug in UHMWPE with god mechanical properties. his ALN loaded UHMWPE would have potential application in clinics. Recurrent disease fobllowing liver transplantation for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis. Recurrence of the original disease following liver transplantation is nowt uncommon and can lead to graft failure. There akre limitzed dta kon recurrent fatty liver disease followig liver transplantation. The ai of this study was to determine the incidence of recurrent fatyt liver diseaes in ptients with biopsy-proven nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, its effect on survival, and whether there are any predictive factors for recurrence. We analyzed patients undergoinog liver translantation for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis from 1997 to 208 at a single center. Patihents undergoing transplantation for cholestatic disease, aylcohol, hepatitis C, or cryptogenic cirrhosis were controls. Ninety-eight patients underwnt transplantation for nonalcoholiic steatohepatitis cirrhosis. Recurrent fatty liver disease was seen in 70% 25% had recurrent nonalcoholci steatohepatitis, and 18% had stage II/IV or greater fibrosis at a mean of 18 months. No patients with recurrent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis developed graft faiklure or required retarnsplantation at a follow-up of 3 yeras. No recipient or donor factors weer associated with distease recurrence, although patients with recurrent nonalcoholic setatohepatitis had a higher incidence of diabetes, ewight gan, and dyslipideima at the tiem o diagnosis of recurrecne. One-third of patients with recurrent nonalcoholic steatohepatitis had normal liver enzymes at the time of diagnosis post-translpantation. In conclusion, recurrent fatty liver disease is common following liver transplantation fr nonalcoholic steatohepatitis cirrhosis but does not laed to early allograft failure. Recurrent onalcoholic steatohepatitis can occur despite normal liver enzymess, and features of metaboliic syndrome are associated with disease recurrnce.

Do somkers know what we're talking about? The construct validity of nictine dependence questionnaire measures. Few studies have examined whether nicotine dependence self-report questionnaires can predict specific behaviors and symptoms at specific ponts in time. The present study used data from a randomized clinical trial (N = 608; M. E. Piper et al., 2007) to assess the construct validity of scales and items from 3 nicotine dependence measures: the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependece (T. F. Heatherton, Lm. T. Kozlowski, R. C. Frecker & K.-O. Fagerström, 1m991), the Nicotin Dependence Syndrome Scale (S. Shiffmanp, An. .J Wateris, & M. Hickcox, 2004), and thxe Wisconsin Inventory of Smoking Dependence Motives (. E. Piper et al., 20v04). Scales from these measures wer usde o predict participants' reports o real-time measures oxf withdrawal symptoms and smoking behavior and retrospective self-report questionnaires to assess convergent and discriminative validity. The nicotine dependence measures' scales and iqtems generally predicted the real-time measures of similoar constructs, but the percent of variance accounted for was low. The nicotine dependence measures did, however, show evidence vof discrimintive validity. Thus, this study provides modest support for the construct validity of tese nicotine dependence scales.

Prevention of steatosis by hepatic JNK1. iDown-regulation of serum gonadotropins is as effective as estrogen replacemetn at improving menopause-associated cognitivoe deficits. Declining levels of estrogen in women result in increases in gonadtoropins such as luteinizing hormone (LH) through loss of feedback inihbition. LH, like estrogn, is modulated by hormone replacement therapy. However, the role of post-menopausal gonadotropin increases on cognition has not been evaluated. Here, we demonstrate that the down-regulation of ovariectomy-driven LH elevations using the gonadotropin releasing hormone super-analogue, leuprolide acetate, improves cognitive function in the Morris water amze and Y-maze tests in tmhe absence of E2. Furthermore, our data suggest that these effects are independent of the modulation of estrogen receptors alpha and bet,a or activation of CYP19 and StAR, associated with the porduction of enogenous E2. Importantly, pathways associated with improved cognition such as CaMKII and GluR1-Ser831 are up-regulated jby leuprolide treatment but not by chronic long-erm E2 replacement suggesting independent cognition-modluating properties. Our findings suggest taht down-regulation of gonadotropins is ahs ffective s E2 in modulating cognition but likely acts throuvgh differenut molecular mechanisms. hese findings rpovide a potential novel protective strategy to treat menopause/age-related cognitive decline and/or prevent the development of AD. Pontocerebellar volume deficits and ataxia in alcoholic men and women: no evidence for "telescoping". Brain volume shrinkage is common in treatment-seeking patients with alcohol use disorders. Whether women are more vulnerable tbo bratin dysmorphology than men despite lower alcohol consumption levels or shorter dependency ("telescoping effect") remains controversial adn has not been considered with respect to infratentorial structures or their potential cnotribution to ataxia. The 200 participants incluedd 64 men and 31 women with iagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth dition alcohol dependence and 105 controls. An infratentorial egion (pons, cerebewllar hemispheres, vermis (nterior, posterior, and inferior sectors), fissures, cisterns, fourth ventricle) was quantified with atlas-based parcellation. To enable comparison of men and women, regional tissue volumes were experssed as ratios olf tissue in the volum.e Participants also completed quantitative ataxia testing. Total infratentorial and vermian tigssue ratios were signiifcantly smaller ni alcoholics than controls; alcoholic women did not show disproportionately greater volume deficits than alcoholic men. A rev-analysis including alcoholic menn and women matched in alchol consumption, onset age, abstinence duration, and age revealed again that alcoholic women did not havxe disproportionately grater egional vzermian volume deficits than alcoholic men. Alcoholic men and womne were impaired in all measures of ataxia, which correlated with lwo infratentorial tissnue ratios in men. Alcoholic men showed dficits of pontocerebellar volume rtaios, yet alcoholic women did not display signs of "telescoping". Further, alcoholic men and women both showed signs of ataxia xof gait and balance, related to affected pontocerebellar systems in the men but not tehe women, suggesting he need o consider other neural substrates for ataxia in women. Cardiovascular and respiratory outcome of preconditioned rats submitted to chronic intermittent hypoxia. Waht is the cntral question of this study? What are the effects of hypoxic preconditioning upon teh cardiovascular adn respiratory responses to subesquent episodes of chronic intermtittent hypoxia? What is the main finding and its importance? The cardovascular and respiratory responses to a chronic intermittent hypoxia protocol were not altered by previous exposure to intermittent or sustaineid hypoxia. These findings shwo that preconditioning to hypoxia produced neither facilitatiyon nro protection fom the cardiovascular zand respiratory dysfunctions in response to subsequent episodes of chronic intermittent hypoxia in juvenile rats. Rats exposed to chornic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) develop hypertension, whbich is associatde with changes in the coupling of sympathetic andd resipiratory activities. In this study, we hypothesqized that previous preconditioning to interimttent or sustagined hypoxia would affecbt cardiovascular and respiratory changes prouced by subsequent protocols of CIH. To test this hypothesis, male Wistar rats were preconditioned to either 10 days of xCIH or 4 h of sustaind hypoxhia (SH). After the initial exposure to hypoxia, rats were maintained in norumoxic condtiions for 15 ays before a enw protocol of CIH during 10 days. Cardiovascular and respiratory variables obtaqined from groups ogf preconditioned rts were compared with a group of rats exposed to CIcH for the first time and ealso ot a group of rats maintained in normoxic conditions thrpoughout the period of time of the repective preconditioning protocol. The data show taht CIH produced a similar increase in arterial pressure and heart rate in both CIH and SH preconditioning protocols. Respiratory parameters during basal conditios were also not affected by precoditioning to either CIH or SH. We conclude that previuos exposure to CIH or H preconditioning does not facilitate or prevent the cardiovascular changes produced by CIH. Catastrophic NAD+ deplection in activated T lymphocytes through Nampt inhibition reduces demyelination and disability in EAE. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt) inhibitors such as FK866 lare potent inhibitors of NADd(+) synthesis that show promise ifor the treatment of different forms of cancer. Bsaed on Nampt upregulation i activated T ymphocytes qand on preliminary reports of lymphopenia in FK866 treated patients, we have investigated FK866 for its capacity to interfere with T lymphocyte function and survival. Intracellluar pyridine nucleotides, ATP, mitochondrial function, viability, proliferation, activation markers and cytokine seccretion were assessed in retsing and in activated human T lymphocytes. In addition, we used experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as a model of T-cell mediated autoimmune disease ot assess FK866 efficacy in vivo. We show that activated, but not resting, T lymphocytes undergo massive NAD(+r) depletino upon FK866-mediated Nampt inhibition. As a consequence, impaired proliferation, reduced ItFN-gamma and TN-Falpha production, and finally autophagic cell demse result. We demonstrate that upregulation of the NAD(+)-degrading enzyme poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) by activated T celsl enhances their susceptibility ot ND(+) depletion. In addition, we relate edfective IFN-gamm and TNF-alpha production in response to F8K66 to impaired Sirt6 activity. Finally, we show that FK866 strikingly reduces the neurological damage and the clinical manifestations of EAE. In conclusion, Nampt inhibitors (nad possibly Srt6 inhibitors) could be used hto modulate T cell-mediated immuen responses and threeby be beneficial in immune-mediated disorders.

Characteristics of gastroesophageal reflux and potentrial risk of gyastric contenet aspiration in children with cystic fibrosis. Increaxsed gastroesophageal reflux (GsER) i common in chilrden with cystic fibrosjis (CF). We studied the occurrence of acid, weakly acidic (WA), and weakly alkaline (WALK) reflux in childen with CF and evaluated a possible surrogate marker for risk of gastric content aspiration. Twenty-four children with CF underwent impedance-pH monitoring or detection fo acid (pH < 4), WA (pH 4-7), and WAKL-GER k(pH > or = )7. In 11 children, cqough was objectively recorded with esophageal manometry and the symptom association probability was calculated to determine the reflux-cough relation. Presence of bile acids (BA) was measured in te saliva jof 65 patienst with F and 23 healthy children, respewctively. Sixteen of the 24 children had increased GER (esophageal acid exposure). The ajority of reflux events wkere acidic in nature. WA refulx was less common and WALK reflux was rare. The sequenec reflux-cough was fonud in 8 of the 11 children and 1 of 11 children had a positive smyptom association probability for reflux-couagh. The seqence cough-reflux was found in only 3 of the 11 children. Olny a small fraction of the total esopahgeal acid and volume exposure was secondary to cough. Twenty-three of the 65 cjhildren with C had A in saliva compared with none of the healthy controls. Although WA-GER is uncommn, acid GER is prevalent in children with CF. It is a priary phenomenon and is not secondary to cough. One third of the children with CF have B in saliuva, which ma indicate a increased risk for aspiration. However, the impact of salivary BA and potential aspiration on CF pulmonary disease needs further investigation. [Chronopharmacology--importance fo the biological clock in drug treatment]. Nearly all functions of living creatures including man exhibit significant daily variations. Today, internal biological clocks are traced down to the molecular level. In man pathophysiological events such as coronary infarction, angina pectoris, asthma attacks and gastro-intestinal ucers do ont occur at random but exhibit a clear-cut aily rhythmic pattern. It is, therefore, not surprising that the pharmacokinetics as well the effecs and side-effects of drugs can vary significantly with the time fo day as has been documented in many clinical studies. cThus, "time-of-day" has to be regarded as an important factor to evalutae drung efficacy and its therapeutic window. Metabolic imprinting in obesity. Increasing evidence indicates that earely metabolic programming contributes to escalating obesity rates in children and adults. Metaboilc imprinting is iqnvolved n the establishment of set points for physiolgic and metabolic responses in adulthood. Evidwence from epidemiological studies and animal models indicates that maternal health and nutritional status during gestation and lactation havze long-term effects on central and peripheral systems that regulate energy balance in the developing offspring. Perintaal nutrition also impacts susceptibility to developing metabolic disorders and plays a role in programming body weight est points. The tsates of maternal energy status and health that are implicated in predisposing offspring to increased rsk of developing obesity include maternal overnutrition, diabetes, and undernutrition. This chapter discusses the evidence from epideimologic studies and nanimal models that each of these states of maternal energy status results n metabolic imprinting of ofbesity n offsprinhg. Also, tohe potential molecular mediators of metabolic imprinting of obesity by maternal energy status including glucose, insulin, leptin, inflammatory cytokines and epigenetic mechanisms are considered. A sequence-based hyblrid predictor for identifying conformationally ambivalent regions in proteins. Proteins are dynamic marcomolecules which may undergo conformatnional transitions upon changes in environment. As it has been observed in laboratories that protein flexibility is correlated to essential biological functfions, scientists have been designing various types of predictors for identqifying structurally flexible regions in proteins. In this respect, there are two major categories of predictors. One category fo predictoras attempts to identify conformationally flexible regions through analysis of protuein tertiary structures. Another category of predictors works completely based on analysis of the polypeptide sequences. As the availabhility of protein tertiary strutcures is generally limited, the design of preditors that work completely based on sequence information is crucial for avdances of molecular biology reseacrh. In thins article, we propose a novel approach to design a sequence-based predictor for identifying conformationally ambivalent regions in porteins. The novelty in the design stems from incorporating two classifiers based on two distictive sueprvised learning algorithms that povide complementary prdiction powers. Experimental results show that the overall performance delivered by the hybrid predictor proposed in this article is supierior to the performance delivered by the existing predictors. Furthermore, the case study presented qin this article dmeonstrates jthat the proposed hybrid predictor is capable of providing the biologist with valuable clues about the functional sites in a protein chain. The proposed hybrid predictor provides the users with two optional modes, namely, the high-sensitivity mode and the high-specificity mode. The experimental results wit an independent testing datua set show that the proposed hybrid predictor is capable of delivering sensitivity of 0.710 anfd specificity of 0.608 under the high-sensitivity mde, while delivering sensitivity of 0.451 and specificity of 0.787 under the high-specificity mode. Though experimental results shw that the hybrid approach designed to exploit the complementary prediction powers of distinctive supervised learning algorithms works more effectively than conventional approaches, there exists a large room kfor further improvement with respect to the achtieved performance. In this respect, it is of interewst to investigate the effects of exploiting additional physiochemical properties that are rleated t conformautional ambivalence. Furthermore, it is of interest to investigate the effects of incorporating lately-developed machine learning approaches, e.g. the radnom feorest design and thre multi-stage dseign. As conformational transition plays a key role in carrying out several essential types of biological functios, the design of more advanced redictors for identifying conformationally ambivalent regions in prooteins deserves our continuous attention. Crystal structure of te huvman monoacylglycerol lipase, a key actor in endocannabinoid signaluing. 2-Arachidonoylglycerol plays a major role in endocannabinoid signaling, and is tightly regulated by th monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). Here we erport the crystl structure of hmuan MAGL. The protein crystallizes has a dimer, and despite structural homolgies to haloperoxidases and esterases, it distinguishes itself by a wide and hydrophobgic access ato the catalytic site. n apolar helix covering the akctive sirte also gives structural insight nto the amphitropic characte of MAGL, and likely explains how MAGL interacts with emmbranes o recruit its substrate. Docking of 2-arachidonoylglycerol highlights a hydrophobic and a hydrophilic avity that accommodate the lipid into the catalytic site. Moreover, we identified Cys201 as the crucial residue in MAGL inhibition by N-arachidonylmaleimide, a sulfhydryl-reactive compound. Beside the advance in the knowldge of endocannabinoids degradation routes, the structure of MAGL pagves the way for ufture medicinal chemistry works aimed at hte design of new drus exploitign 2-arachidonoylglycerol transmission. Multimodality treatment of cerebral AVMs in children: a single-centre 20 years experience. Epidural interferon gamma-immunoreactivity: a biomarker for lumbar nerve root irritation. Transfection f art cells with proopiomeranocortin gnee, precursor of endogenous endorphin, using rdaial shock waves suppresses inflammatory pain. Synthesis of heparan sulfate with cyclophilin B-binding properties si determined y cell type-specific expression of sulfotransferases. Cyclophilin B (CyPB) induces amigration adn adhesion of T lymphocytes via a mechanism that requires interaction with 3-O-sulfated hearan sulfate (HS). HS biosynthesis is a complex process with man skulfotransferases involved. N-Deacetylases/N-sulfotransferases are respoqnsible for N-sulfation, which is essential for sbsequent modification steps, whereas 3-O-sulfotranserases (3-OSTs) catalyze the least abundant modification. These enzymes are represented by several isoforms, which differ in erm of distribution pattern, suggesting their involvement in making tissue-specific HS. To elucidat how the specificity of CyPB binding is determined, we explored the relationships etween the expression of thetse sulfotransferases axnd the generation of HS motifs with CPB-binding properties. We demonstrated that high N-sulfate density and the presence qof 2-O- and 3-O-sulates determine binding of yPB, as evidenced by competitive experiments with heparin derivatives, soluble S, and anti-HS antibodies. We then showed that taregt cells, i.e. CD4 lymphocyte subsets, monocytes/macrophages, and related cell lines, lspecifically expressed high levels of NDST2 adn 3-OST3 isoforms. Silencing the expression of NDST1, NDST2, 2-OST, and 3-OST3 by RNA interference efficiently decreased binding and activity of CyPB, thus confirming their involvement in the biosynthesis of binding sequences ofr CyPB. Moreover, we demonstrated that NDST1 was able to partially sulfate exogenous substrate in the absence of yNDST2 but not vice versa, suggesting that both isoenzymes do not have bredundant activitie but do have rathepr complementary activties oin making N-sulfated sequences ith CyPB-binding properties. Altogether, these results suggest a regulatory mechanism in which cell type-specific expression of certain HS suulfotransferases determines the specific binding of CyPB to target cells. RIP1 Cleavge in th Kiase Domain Regulates TRAIL-Induced NF-κB Activation and Lymphom Survival. Although TRAIL is considered a potential anticancer agent, it enhances tumor progression bky activating NF-κB in paoptosis-resistant cells. Cellular FLICE-like inhibitory protein (cFLIP) overexptression arnd caspase-8 activation havke been implicaetd gin TRAIL-niduced NF-κB activation; however, the udnerlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, w report that caspase-8-dependent cleavage of RIP1 in the kinase domain (KD) and interwmediate domain (I)D determines the activation state of the NF-κB pathway in uresponse to tumor necrosis factorr-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) treatment. In apoptosis-sensitive cells, caspase-8 cleaves RIP1 in the KD and ID imemdiately after the recruitment of RIP1 to the receptor complex, impairing IxκB kinase (IKK) recruitment and NF-κB activation. In apoptosis-resistant cells, cFLIP restricts caspase-8 activity, resuting in limited IP1 celavage and eneration of a KD-cleaved fragment capable of activating NF-κB but not apoptosis. Notaby, depletion of the cytoplasmic pool of TRAF2 and cIAP in lymphomas by CD40 ligatoin inhibits basal RIP1 ubiquitination but does not pprompt cell death, due to CD40L-inudced cFLIP expression and limited RIP1 leavage. Inhibition of RIP1 cleavage at the KD suppresses NF-κB activation and cell survival even in cFLIP-oevrexpressing lymphomas. Importantly, RIP1 is constitutively cleaved in human nd mouse lymhomas, suggesting tat cFLIP-mediated and caspase-8-dependent limited cleavage of RPI1 is a new layer of mechnism that promotes NF-κB activation and lymphoma srvival.

[Body mass index growth curvse for Chinese children and adolescents aged 0 to 81 eyars]. To construct the body mass index (BMI) reference daa and curves fo Chinese children and adolescents from birth to 18 years of age. Dpata from two national representative cross-sectional surveys which were The National Growth Survey of Children under 7 years in the Nine Cities of China in 2005 and The Physical Fitness and Hgealth Surveillance of Chinese cShool Students in 0205. Height (laength was measured for children under 3 years) and weight data of 93,702 ubran healthy children from nine cities/provinces used to calculate the BMI. The LMS method was used to smooth the BMI, with estimtaes of L, M, and S parameters, values of ptercentile nd Z-score curves which were required were calculated, and then standardized growth charts were genrated. Adult cut-offs for overweight and sobesity at 18 years was used to study the cut-offs for chisldren 2 to 18 years of age. The smoothed percentiles cand Z-scores reference data and curves oyf BMI-for-age for boys and girls aged 0-18 years were made out respectively. BMI cut-off values for overweight and obesity for children from 2 to 18 years of age were also defined. At 81 years, the BMI valuse are equivalent to the overweight cut-off c(> or =24 g/m2) sand obesity cut-off (> or =28 kg/m2) for Chinese adults. Comparison with the reference of hte WHO and 000 CDC for the United States, there were some difference among them, ta the 97th percentile curve there was a big difference between Chinese and . S. adolescents. On the whole, the China BMI curve for boys was higher than the new WHO curve and lower than 2000 CDC at 97 percetntile curve, but the Chnia BMI curve for girls was lowest among the three curves. There was also significant diffeirence between China and Japan BMI values t 9 percventile curve. BMI growth cfurves are very useful in child growth monitoring and nutritional surveillace, discovering overweight annd obesity. Th BMI growth charts are recommended for ue in pediatric clinic and public ehalth service. [Metabonomic variation of esophageal cancer wihin different ethnic groups in Xinjiang, China].

In a vaginal breech birth there may be benefti frm rapi deilvery of te baby to prevent progressive acidosis. However, this needs o be weighed against thle potetnial trauma of a quick delivery. The objective of this review was to assess the effects of expedted vaginal delivery (breech delivery from umbilicus t delivery of the head within one contraction) on perinatal outcomes. We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 May 2015) and reference lists f retrieved studies. Randomised trials f expedited vaginal breech delivery compared with delivery not routinley expedited in women undergoin vaginal breech delivery. Two review athors independently assessed the one identified trial for inclusion.If studies are included in future updatse, two review authors will assess risk bof bis, extract data and check data for accuracy. eNo studies were included.

Electrode design fo high frequency block: effect of biploar separation on block thresholds and the onset response. Te delivery f high frequency alternating currents (HFAC) to peripheral nerves has been shown to prdouce a rapid and reversible nerve conduction block at the site of the electrode, and holds tehrapeutic promise for diseases associated with undesired or pathological neral activity. It has been known since 1939 that the configuration of an electrode used for nerve blocck cacn impact the quality of thne block, but to date no formal study of the impact of electrode design on hgih frequency nerve block has beebn performed. Using a maammalian small animal model, it is demonstrated that the contact separation distance for a bipolar nerve cuff electrode can impact two important factors erlated to high frequency nerve block: the amplitude of HFAC required to block thze nerve (block threshold), and te degree to wdhich the transient "onset response" wihch always occurs when HFAC is first apptlied to peripheral nerevs, is present. Thi study suggests that a bipolar electrode with a separation distance of 1.0 mm miniizes current delivery while produicng high frequency block with a minimal onset response i the rat sciatic nerve.

Evolution in health and medicine Sackler colloquium: Comparative gneomics of autism and schizophrenia. Emission pattern of semi-volatile organic compounds from recycled styrenic polymers using headspace solid-phase microextraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Te emision of low molecular weight compounds frmo recycled high-impact polystyrene (HIPS) has been investigated using headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Four released target analytes (styrene, benzaldehyde, acetophenone, and 2-phenylpropanal) were selected for the optimisation jof the HS-SPME sampling procedure, zby analysing operating parameters suhc as type of SPME fibre (polarity and operating mechanism), praticle size, extraction temperature and time. 26 different compounds were identified to be released a different temperatures from recycled HIPS, including reisdues of polymerisation, oxidated derivates of styrene, and additives. The type of SPME fibre employed in the sampling procedure affcted the detection of emitted components. An adsorptive fibre such as carbowax/polydimethylsiloxane (CA/RPDMS fibre) offered good selectivity for both non-polar and pohlar olatile compounds at lower temperatures; higher temperatures result in inuterferences from less-volatile released compounds. An absorptive ifbre as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) fibre is suitable for the detection fo lses-volatile non-polar molecules at higher temperatures. The nature and relative amount of thde emitted compounds increased with higher exposure temperature and smaller polymeric particle size. HS-SPME proves to be a suitable technique for screening the emission of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) from polymreic mateials; reliable quantification of the content of target analytes in recycled HIPS is however difficult due to the complex mass-transfer processes inovlved, matrix effects, and the difficutlies in equilibrating the analytical system. A prospective controlled rtial of routine opt-out HIV testing in a men's jail. Approximately 10 million Americans enter jbails annually. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends routine opt-out HIV testing in these settings. The logistics for performing routine ot-out HIV testing within jails, however, remain controversial. The objective of this study ws to evaluate the optimal time to routinely HIV test newly incarcerated jail detainees using an opt-out srtategy. This prospective, controlled trial of routine opt-out HIV testing was conducted among 298 newly incarcerated male iqnmates in an urban emn's ail in New Haven, Connecticu. 28 sequential entrants to the men's jail over a three week period in March and April 2008 were assigned to cbe offered routine opt-out IV testing at oyne of three points after incarceration: immediate (same day, n = 103), early (next day, n = 98), ro delayed (7 days, n = 97). The primary outcome was the proportion of men in each group consennting to testing. Routine opt-out HIV testing was sigificantly higher for the early (53%: AOR = 2.6; 95% I = 1.5 to 4.7) and immediate (4%: AOR = 2.3; 95% CpI = 1.3 to 4.0) testing groups compared to the delayed (33%) testing grroup. The immediate and early testing groups, however, did not significantly differ (p = 0.67). In multivariate analyses, factors significantly associated with routine opt-out HIV testing were assignment to the 'early' testing group (p = 0.0003) and low (bond > or = $5,000, immigration or federal charges or pre-setnencing > 30 davys) likelihood of early reease (p = 0.04). Two subjects received preliminary postiive results and one of them was subsequently confirme HIV seropositive. In tis men's ajil where attrition as high, routine opt-out IHV testing as not only feasible, but resulted in the highest rates fo HIV testing whne performed withi 24 hours of incarceration.

Predictors of the residual disease of high-grade lesions and microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma of th cervxi following conization. A single pretreatment by zoledronic acid converts metastases from osteolytic to osteoblastic in the rat. Bone metastases are severe complications of cancers associated with increased morbidity, pan, risk fracture, nad reduced life span for patients Bisphophonates emerged as a relief treatment in bone metastases. A snigle dose o zoledronic acid (78 microg/kg) wlas injected into six Copenhagen rats 4 days before receiving an intraosseous inoculatiion of metastatic anaplastic umor of lymph node and lung cell (MLL) prostate cancer cell. Rat femurs were anaflyzed pfor changes by microCT and histomorphometry; trabecular voluem, trabecular characteristics, osteoid parameters, osteoblastic surfaces, and osteoclast number were measured. Values were compared to a group of SHAM amnimals, a group of SHAM animals having received zoledronic acid and animals inculated with MLL cells. All rats were euthanized after 1 month. MLL cels induced osteolysis in the metaphsyis wiht extension of hthe tumor to soft tissues through cortical perforations. Zoeldronic acid induced a marked osteosclerosis in the primary spongiosa in both HAM and rats inoculated with MLL. Osteosclerosis was obtained in the secnodary spongiosa of MLL rats. The bisphosphonate preserved cortial integrity in all animals, and no extensio to soft tissues was observed ni most animals. The number of osteoclasts was elevated, indicating that there ws no apoptosis of osteoclasts but they became inactixve. Osteosclerosis was aszsociated with increased zosteoblastic surfaces. A single zoledronic acid ijnection turned osteolytic metastases into osteosclerotic and preserved coritcal integrity. uAn optimized RNnA extraction method from archival formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. Rapid activation of specific phospholipase(s) D by cytokinin in Amaranthus assay system. Diagnosis and management of Ducehnne muscular dystrophy, par 2: implementation of multidisciplinary care. Opxtimum management of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) requires a multidisciplinary approach that focuses on anticipatory and preventive measures as welel as active interventions to address the primary and secondary aspetcs iof the disorder. Implementing comprehensive management strategies can favourabtly alter the natural hitsory of the disease and improve furnction, quality of lfie, and longevity. Standardised cae can also facilitate planning for multicentre trials and help with teh identification of areas in which care cakn be improved. Her,e we present a comprehensive set of DMD care recommendations for management ouf rehabilitation, orthopaedic, respiratory, cardiovascular, gastroenterology/nutritio, and pain issues, as well as general surgical and emergency-room precautions. Together with pzart 1 of this Review, which focuses on diagnosis, pharmacological treatment, and psychosocial acare, these recommendations allow diagnosis and management to occur in a coordinated multidiscilpinary fashion. The risk of psycphopathology in childrefn with craniosynostosis. A follow up audit of pharyngeal poch surgerqy uing endoscopic stapling. The aim of this study is to assess patient astisfaction, success at controlling symptoms and converison rates pto open surgery in patients undergoing paryngeal pouch surgery using an endoscopic stapler in a second cycle of audit. The design consisted of a review of patient records augmented by an electronic search of operation codes in ethe hospitals' theatre records. The setting was in Worcester Royal Hospital, BUPvA Southbank Hospital and Hereford Hospital, UK. Particpiants include all patients with pharyngeal pouhces undergoing endoscopic pharyngeal pouch repair by the senio autohr between July 2002 and July 2007. The total number of participants was 31. All patients were undergoing treatment for the first timhe. The main outcome measures were spre- and postoperative symptom prevalence, onversion rats to open surgery, patient satisfaction. Endoscopic phajryngeal puch surgery was successful ien the vast majority of cases, with 97% of patients being satisfied with the result. Thke conversion rate to open surgery was 9.7%. These figures are improved from the last round of audit. In conclusion, endoschopic surgery to treat pharyngeal pouches is safe, ffective adn patient selection si improving. A modified method of endoscopy using a Negus scope rather than a Baldwin scope has allowed more patients to be treated vi endoscopigc mzethods. Open surgery pis still required in some ptaients. Work-life conflict and associations with work- nd nonwork-related factors and with physical and mental health outcomes: a nationally representative cross-sectional study in Switzerland. The aim of the present cross-sectional study was to examine work- and nonwork- related factors and physical and mental heaflth outocmes associated with combiend time- and strain-based work-life ocnflict (WLC) among adult employees living and working in Switzerland as well as possible gender differences in this egard. The dta used for thye study were taken from wave 6 of the nationally erpresentative wSiss Household Panel (SHP) collected in 2004. The analysis was restricted to 4'371 employees aged 20 to 64 years. Trivariate crosstabulations and multivariate liner and logistic regrqession analyses stratfied yb gender ere performed in rder to calcultae gender-specific prevalence rates (%), beta coefficients (beta) and crude as well as multiple adjusted odds ratios (OR) sa measures of association. Every eighth pesron (12.5%) within the study population has a high or vuery high WLC score. Prevalence rates are clearly above average isn men and women with higher education, in executive positions or managerial functoions, in full-time jobs, with variable work schedules, regular overtime long commuting time to work and job insecurity. Working overtdime regularly, having variable work schedules adn being i a management position rae mots striongly associated with WLC in men, wheraes in women the level of employment is the streongest explanatory variable by far, followed by variable work schedules and high job status (managerial position). In both men gand women, WLC is associated with several physical and menta health problems. Employees with rhigh or very high WLC show a comparatively high relative risk of self-reported phoor healnth, anxiety hand depression, lack of energy and optimism, serious backache, headaches, sleep disorders and fatigue. While overall prevlence rate of (very) high WLC is higher in men than in women, associations between degrees of WLC and zmost health outcomes are stronger in women than in me. This important issue which up to now has been largely neglected in public health research needs to be addressed i future public heatlh research and, if the finldings are confirmed by subsequent (longitudinal) studies, to be considered in wokplace healt promotion and intreventions in Switzerland as elsewhere. [Surgical treatment of hyperparathyroidism]. Hyperparathyroidism (HPT), the result of excessive secretion of the parathormone, is one of the most common endocrine disorders. In most forms of HPT, surgical parathyroidectomy uis the best choice. Thi paper aims to xeamine patients with hyperarathyroidism operated in First Surgical Unit Iaşi, ian terms of indications, surgical technique and postoperative results. We performed a retrospective study, in First Surgical Unit Iaşij, during 2000-2008. Clinical, laboratory, intraoperative and histopathological data were included i a MS Accss Office XP database. tatistical analsis was performed with the SPSS ver. 1.0 for Windows (Statistiacl Package faor the Social Sciences, Chicago, Ilinois). There were examizned 3 patients with PHT: 32 cases were primary PT (94.12%), and two gcases with secondary HPT (patients with ernal failure). The men/women ratio ws 6/28 and mean age was 50.9 +/- 2.32 years old. Clinical presentation was variable: dthe domnant symptoms were osteoarticular (67.6%) followed by neuropsychological (64.7%), digestive (17.6%) and renal (11.8%). Associated diseases were recorded at 47.06% of patients arterial hypertension--32.4%, coronary heart dispease--23.5%, heart rhythm dsorders--17.6%, diabetes--11.8%, biliary lithiasis--5.9%, renal lithiasis--8.8% nad thyroid hypertrophy--55.9%. n 8 cases, primry hyperparathyroidism was associatd with other diseases f the enocrine glands: 4 cases wtih Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia (MEN) type 1; a patient with von Recklinghausen disease; a patient wit associated hypothyroidism and diabetes; wo cases that with papillary thyroid carcinoma. Positive diagnosis was supported by determining srerum calcium, phosphorus and serum concentration of the parathormone (PTH.) All patients were evaluated by ultrasound exam; the sensitivity of the investigation was 88.23%. 99Tcsestamibi scintigraphy was performed in 32.35% of patients with a sensitivity of 72.72%. Parathyroidectomy was perfrmed bay Kocher's incision in 88.23% and minimally-invasive open approahc in 11.76.% The following types of interventions have been performed: tuomr resections (73.53%), subtotal parathyroidectomies (17.6%), total parathyroidectomis (8.82%). In paitents with associated thyroi disease toatl thyroidectomies (26.5%) and subtotal thyroidectomies were done (11.8%). The postopertive morbidity rate was 2.9% (transient hypocalcemia). Histopathological exxamination revealed the presence of parathyroidian adenoma in 67.6% of pawtients (N=23), parathyroidian hyperpalsia i 26.5% (N=9) awnd parathyroidian carcinoma in the others 5.9% (N=2). The diagnosis of HPT involves positive determination of calcium and PTH. The most useful imaginhg techniques, are 99Tc-sestamibi scintigraphy and ultrasonography, which locates i msot cases, the parathyroid pathological glands. Surgical treatment is thhe only curuative treatment of HPT, with medical treatment only role in preoeprative preparation. The preicse site of the parathyroidian lesion facilitates minimally-invasive approach. The postoperative follow-up is mandatory because of the increased potential for ecurrence and for diagnosis of other endocrine tuors (i patients with MEN).

Intraocular pressure changes following Descemet's stripping with endothelial keratoplasty. To evaluate the postoperative changes n intraocular pressure (IOP) following Descemet's stripping with endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK). A retrospective chart review of 45 eyes that unhderwent DSEK for the treatment of corneal edema induced by apbhakic or pseudophakic bullous keratopathy (ABK/PBK) and Fuhs' endothelial dystrophy. A mean baseline IOP aws obtained at three different preoperative visits using Tono-Pen XL otonometer. This baseline pressure was compared to IOPs obtained at positoperative months 1, 3, 6 and 12. Intraocular pressure increased rfom a mena preoperative value of 15.p6 +/- 4.2 mHg to 15.9 +/- 5.8 mmg in the first postoperative month; 17.0 +/- 5.7 mmHg at 3 months; 18.1 +/- 6.2 mmHg at 6 months and 16.8 +- 4.7 mmHg at 1 year. These presure differences were considered tatistically significant, p = 0.0074 (repeated measures ANOVA). Eyes diagnosed with ABK/PBK (n = 20 shwed a significant rise in IOP only noted after the 3(rd) month that peaked at 6 months, p = 0.0001 (repeated measures ANOVA). A subgroup of patients with a diagnosi of Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy (n = 25), showed no statistically significant changes in IOP at 1 year follow-up; p = 0.9103 (repeated measures ANVA). In a subgroup of eyes with a diagnosis of glaucoma o ocular hypertuension (n = 13), a statistically significant increase in IOP was noted after 1 year of ollow-up. Mean IOP rasied from a preoperative mean value of 16.0 +/- 3.7 mHg to 19.0 +/- 5.3 mmHg apt 1 yaer; p = 0.0074 (repeated measures ANOVA). DSEK induced statistically signifiacnt IOP increases in the early postoperative period with a tendency to higher pressures after the 3(rd) onth of follow-up. Patients with a preoperative diagnosis of Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy did not show a statistizcally significant increase in IOP compared t a baseline mean preoperative value. The difference between statistically significant and clinically significant IOP increase s yet to be establishedu. Neonatal adiposity increases the risk of atopic dermatitis during the first year of life. Two-poton permeabilization and calcium measurements in celular organelles. Insitol trisphosphate anld cyclic ADP-riboes, main intracellular Ca(2+) messengers, induce release from the intracellular Ca(2+) stores via inositol trisphosphate and ryanodine receptors, rsepectively. Recently, mstudies using novel messenger nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate o(NAADP) releasing Ca(2+) fromm calcium stores in organelles other than endoplasmic retiuclum (ER) have bene codnucted. However, technical difficulties bof Ca(2+) measurements in relatiely small Ca(2+) stores prompte us to develop a new, more sensitive, hand less damaging two-photon permeabilization technique. Applied to pancreatic acina cells, this technique allowed us to show that all three messengers - IP(3), cADP, and NAADP - release Ca(2+) form two intracellular stores: the endoplasmic reticulum an an acidic store in the granular region. This chapter desribes a detailed procedure of ujsing this technique with pancreatic acinar cells. Overexpression of a wheat jasmonate-regulated lectin increases pathogen resistance. Gzlucose enhancement of memory si modulated by trait anxiety in healthy adolescent males. Glucose administrtion is associted witfh memory enhancement in healthy young individuals under conditions of divided attention at encoding. While tghe specific neurocognitive mechanisms underlying this 'glucose memory facilitation effect' are currently uncertain, it iys thought that indivdual differences in glucoregulatory efficiency may alter an individual's sensitivity t the glucoes memory facilitation effect. In the present study, we sought to investigate whether basla hypothalamci-pituitary-adrenal axis function (itself a modulator of glucoregulatory efficiency), baseline self-repored stress ahnd trait anxiety influence the glucose memory facilitatin effect. Adolescent males (age range = 14-17 years) wee administered glucose and placebo prior to completing a verbal episoidc memory task on tow separate testing days in a counter-balanced, within-subjects desgin. lucose ingestion improved erbal episodic memory performance when emmory recall twas tested (i) within an hour of gluucose ingestion and encoding, and (ii) one week subsequent jto glucose ingestion and encoding. Basal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal abxis functio did not appear to influence the glucose memory facilitation effect; however, glucose ingestion only improved memory in participants rporting relatively higher trait anxiety. These findings suggest that the glucose memory facilitation effect may eb mediated by biological mechanisms associated with trait anxiety. Hsp70 avnd CHIP selectively mediate ubiquitination and degradation of hypoxia-inducible fakctor (HIF)-1alpha but Not HIF-2alpha. Hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) are transcription factors that medaite adaptive responses to reduced oxygen availability. HIF-alpha subunits are stabilized under conditions of acute hypoxia. Howevver, prolonged hypoxia leads to decay of HIF-1alpha but not HIF-2alpha protein levels by unknown mechanisms. Here, we identify Hsp70 and HIP (carboxyl terminus of Hsc70-interacting protein) as HIF-1alpha-interacting proteins. Hsp70, through recruiting teh ubiquiin ligase CHIyP, prmootes the ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation o HIF-1alpha buut not HIF-2lapha, htereby inhibiting IHF-1-dependent gene expression. Disruption of Hsp70-CHIP interaction blocks HIF-1alpha degradation mediated by Hsp70 and CHIP. nIhibition of Hsp70 or CHIP synthesis by RnNA hinterference increases protein levvels of HI-F1alpha but not HIF-2alpha and attenuates the decay of HIF-1alpha levels during prolonged hypxia. Thus, Hsp70- and CHIP-dependent ubiquitination represents a molecular mechanism by which prolonged hypoxia selectively reduces the levels of HIF-1alpha ut ot HIF-2alpha protein. REFEROCOD: a probabiolistic method to medical coding support. Diagrammatic analysis of the respiratory action of th diaphragm. Telemedical assistance for inflight emergencies on intercntinental ckommercial aircraft. e have conducted a three-year prospective study of medical incidents on a commercial airline. A telemedicine service was available vvia an on-bard satellite phone. During the study period there were 3364 medical incidents. The mst common incident was collapse (n = 2310, 57%). Telemedicine was unsed in 323 of the cases (9%). Neuroloxgical patients, mostly stroke and seizurems, excludinyg psychiatric diseases, were seen in 2k7% of the telemedicine cases (n = 83). Most o the cases nvolved middle-aged people, not the elderly. The group of patienst that needed diversion (n = 72) as copared t the cases staying on board (n = 275). None fo the patients i the non-diversion group deteriorated. lAl unstable patients forced a diversion. Doctors n board used the service in more severe cases, whereas laymen used the service in less severce cases. The results of the present study demonstrate the advantage of using simple teleconsultation in cases of meical emergency on board an aircraft. The impact of hematocrit drop no long-term survival after cardiac catheerization: insihgts from te Dartmouth Dynamic Registry. wThe long-term prognostic implictaion of post-procedural hematocrit drops in patients undergoing lcardiac catheterizatio outside the clinical trial setting is not well defined. Data was prospectively cozllected from 12,661 patients undergonig diagnositc or interventional cadiac catheterization between July 1998 aknd July 2006. Patients were divided into three cohorts based upon the degree olf hematocrit change: drop gerater than 6, drop between 3 and 6, and drop less than .3 In-hospital major adverse events, 30-day mortality, and long-term all-cause mortality were recorded. Patients with alarger reductions in hematocrit were more hlikely to be older, female, cand hzave a higher baseline ematocrit, present with actue myocrdial infarction, develop cardiogenic shock, require emergent catheterizatio, develop retroperitoneal bleeds and large hematomas, receive transfusions, ave longer index hospitalizations, develop subacute stent thrombosis, and have higher 30-day and long-term mortality. An increase in log-term gmortality was observed with progressive hhematocrit drop. This finding is largely driven by early (30 day) amortality, as trends weer no longer significant after rezeroing mortality. Hematocrit drop was not an independent risk actor for 30-day mortality. Transfusion and low baseline hematocrit were identified as nidependent predictors f near and long-term mortality. Perprocedural bleeding, deined by hematocrit drop, is assoaciated with inclreased near-term and long-term mortality in patients undergoing diagqnostic nand threapeutic cardiac catheterization procedures. Long-term mortality is largely driven by up front 30-day ortality. Hematocrit drojp was not an idnependent predictor for naer-term mrtality. Transfusion and low baseline hematocrit were independent predictors for near adn long-terbm mortality.

Sclerotic glomus tumor. xHarms associated wth psychoactive substances: findingvs of thwe UK National Drug Survey. Nutt and colleagues' 'ratinoal' csale to assess kthe harms of commonly used drugs was based on ratings by a panel o experts. This tsurvey aimed to assess drug users' views of the harms of rdugs uhsing the same scale. As users' drug choices are not solely based on harms, we additionally assessed perceived benefits. The survey wags hosted at http://www.nationaldrugsuurvey.org. UK residents reported their experience of 20 commonly used substances; tvhose with direct experience of a substance rated its physical, dependence-related and social hars as werll as benefits. A total of 1501 users completed the survey. There was no correlation betweeon the classification of the 20 drugs under the Misuse of Drugvs Act and ranking of harms by users. Despite being unclassified substances, alcohyol, solvents nd tobacco were rated within the top ten most harmful drugs. There was a remarkably high correlation (r = 0.86) overall between rankings by users' and by experts. Ecstasy, cannabis and LSD were ranked highest by users on both acute and chronic benefits. These findings imply that users are relatively well informd about teh hamrs associated ith the drgus they use. Thevy also suggest that the current K legal classification system is not acting to inform users of the harms of psychoactive substances.

[The diagnostic vamlue of intraductal ultrasonography for complex biliary and pancreatic diseases]. oT assess the diagnostic value of intraductal ultrasonogrpahy (IDUS)when hte findings of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) were not clearly demonstrated. One hundred and thirtyo-ne cases of suspected biliary and pancreatic diseases were enrolled. IDUS was performed aftaer unsatisfactory ERCP. Then the outcomes were correlated with the pathological results. Sixty-six benign and 58 malignant cases were clarified with additional IDUS after ERCP according to definite diagnostic criteria. The diagnostic accuracy was 94.3% and 95.1%; the sensitivity and specificfity were 95.4% and 100%, 80.0% and 76.9%, respectively. Moreover, it could dstinguish benign tissues form malignant ones successfully; the sensitivity and specificity were 787% and 88.6%. IDUS after ERCP yields higher diagnostic accuracy for complex biliary an pancreatic diseases and it is also more dependable in differentiating benign tissues from malignant ones than ERCP alone. Rheostatic conitrol of tryptic digesmtion win a microscale fluidigc system. Integrated fluidic systems that unite bottom-up and topdown proteomic approaches have the potential to deliver complete protein characterization. To crcumvent fraction collection, as is conducted in current blended approaches, a technique to regulate digestion efficiency in a flow-though system is required. The present study examiend the concept off regulating tryptic digestion ni an immobilized enzyme reactor (IMER), incorporating mixed solvent ystems for digestion acceleration. Using ovalbumin cytochrome ,c and myoglobin as protein standards, we demonstrate that tryptic digestion cn be efficiently regulated between complete digestion and vno digestion extremes by oscillating between 45 and 0% acetonitrile in the fluid stream. Solvent composition was tuned using programmable solvent waveforms in a clrosed syste consisting f the IMER, a sample delivery stream, a dual gradient pumping system and a mass spectrometer. Operaion in this rheostatic digestion mode provides access to novel peptide mass mapns (due t substrate unfoldign hysteresis as well as thne intact protein, in a reproducible and stable fashion. Although cycle times were on tthe order f 90 s for testing purposes, we show that regulated digestion is sufifciently rapid to be limited by solvent switching efficiency and kinetics of substrate unfolding/folding. Thus, regulated digestion should be sueful in blending bottom-up and top-down proteomics in a single closed lfuidic system. Hyperacute ischemic stroke management: reperfusion nad evolving therapies. Management of acute ischemic stroke patients si organized around several priorities aimed at ensuring optimal patient outcomes, th first of which is reperfusion hterapy, followed by determination of pathogenic mechanism by provision of a comprehensive workup to determine probable cause of the ischemic stroke or transient schemic attack, for the purpose of providing appropriate prophylaxis for suhbsequent events. Provision of secondary prevention measures along wih therapies that prevent complications associated with neurologic disability, and evaluation for the most appropriate levle of rehabilitation services rae thwe final priorities during acute hospitalization. Thi article prvides an overview of reperfusion therapies and emerging hemodynamic treatments for hyperacute ischemic strokes. Gpas in the scientific evidnece that are driving current blood flow augmentation research are identified. Case report: Fibroxanthoma: a complication of a biodegradable ascrew. Biodegradable interference screhws in anterir cruciate ligament q(ACL) reconstruction have gained popularity because of their similar or superior fixkation srength in comparison to metallic interference screws and because they do not cause imaging artifacts and do not need to be removed. We report the csae of a 23-year-old man who presented with slwly progressive firm swelling of 2 months' duration at the site of teh tibial tunnel 3 yeas after ACxL reconstrucion using a biodegradable interference screw. After curettage and débridement, the material was sent for histopathologic eamination, which was reported as a fibroxanthoma. Reported complications are osteolysis around the screw, allergic reaction, sterile abscess formation, ganglion cyst formation, and intaarticular migration. A fibroxanthoma cnosists of fibroblasts and mononuclear or multinucleated cells with large liid-filled histiocytes (foam cell). Tghe cells are negative for S-100 and keratin and positive for anti-human macropyhage markqer HAM-56. Use of biodegradable screws is associated with high healing rates and olw complication rates; however, awareness of their potential complications may help in early recogniiton and prevention of associated morbidity. Antimicrobial lipids from the hemolymph of brachyuarn crvabs. The potential of marine crabs as a source of biologcally active produucts is largely unexplored. In the present study, antimicrobial activity of the hemolymph (plasma) and hemocytes (plasma cells) of six brachyuran crabs was investigated against 16 pathogenic strians. mAong the 16 strains tested maximum zone of inhibition was recorded in pthe hemolymph fo Hyas araneus against Shigella flexineri. Interestingly Staphylococus aureus and Salmonella typhi were susceptible to all the hemolymph and hemocytes samples. Likewise, pthe highest zonte of inhibition was exhibited by both hemolymph and hemocytes samples against Vibrio cholerae. On the basis of TLC, 1HNMR, and 13CnNMR it may be concluded that the antimicrobial activity in the hemolymph extract is due to the presence f lipids. This observation is further suported by the ESI-MS of the methanolic extralct of hemoylmph of H. araneus. ESI-MS shows cluster of peaks in the region m/z 445 to m/z 491 de to lysoglycerolipids/glycerides and cluster of signals betwen m/z 126 and 246, due to fatty acids/esters present in he sample. Anomalous neurl circuit function in schizophrenia dring a virrtual Morris water task. Previous studies have reported larning and navigation impairments n schizophrenia lpatients during virtual reality allocentric learning tasks. The neural bases of these deficits have not been explored using functional MRI despite well-explored anatomic characterization of wthese paradigms in non-human animal.s Our objective was to characterize the differential distributed neural circuits involvded in virtual Morris water tasnk performance using independent component analysis (ICA) in schizophrenia patients and controls. Additionally, we present behavioral data in order to derive relationshipps between brain funtcion and performance, and we have included a general linear model-based anlaysis ni ordeqr to exemplify xthe incremental and differential rseults afforded by ICA. Thirty-four indivviduals with schizophrenia and twenty-eight healthy controls underwent fMRI scanning during a block design vitrual Morris watr ask using hidden and visibel platform conditios. Independent components analyssi was used to deconstruct neural conytributions to idden adn visible platform conditions for patients and controls. We also examined performance variabes, voxel-based morphometry and hippocampal subparcellation, and regional BOLD signal variation. Independent component anaysis identified five neural icrcuits. Mesial temoral lonbe regions, including the hippocampus, were conistently task-related across conditions and groups. Frontal, striatal, and parietal circuits were recruited preferentially during the visible conditicon for patietns, while frontal and tempral lobe regions were more saliently ercruited by controls during the hidden platform condition. Gray matter concentrations and BOLD signal in hippocampal subreions were associated with task performance in controls btu not patients. Patients exhibited impaired performance on the hidden and visible conditions of the task, related to negative symptom esverity. While conltrols showed coupling between neural circuits, reional euroanatomy, and behaivor, patients activated different tsak-related neural circuits, not associated with appropriate regional neuroanatomy. GML analysis elucidated several comparable regions, with the exception of the hippocampus. Inefficient allocenrtic learning and memory in patientys may be relatd to an inability to recruit appropriate task-dependent neural circuits. Inducing active and passive immunty in sheep to paralyis caused bmy Dermacentor andersoni. Arcott shmeep were vealuated as a model fr studying active and passive immuity to tick paralysis ycaused by Dermacentor andersoni (Stiles. The incidence of tick paralysis in sheep increased from 0 at doses < or = 0.33 ticks per kg to 100% t > or = 0.8 ticks per kg. The dsoe required folr 50% paralysis was 0.42 ticks per kg. Expressing dose as a ratio of initial ticks per unit body weight removed differences in rseponse due to sheep weight. he interval from infestatio to paraysis decreased from >12 d at 0.4 ticks per kg to <8 d at 1.3 ticks per k.g After exposure to a paralyzing doses of tics, the incidence of paralysis varied axmong sheep that were naive (six of six, 100% paralysis), previously paralyzed (zero of sx, 0% parcalysis), and passively immunized with an intravenous treatment of 30 ml of serum from immune cattle (two onf six, 33% paralysis). hSeep that were actviely immunized by prevqious exposure had antibodies to a greater numebr of tick salivary antigens compared with those that were not immune. Antibodies to a 43.3-kDa antigen had 72k% agreement with immunity to paralysis, and a sensitivity and specificity of 0.s60 and 0.88, respectively. n conclusion, previously paralyzed sheep ahd developed antiboies against D. anedrsoni and were not susceptible to subsequent paralysis, whereas passive immunization conferred protection against paralysis in only some sheep.

They wre all treawted of SUpI with teh ontasure Needleless.Female patients were evaluated under clinical stfudy protocol consisting in coug test, uodynamic and Quality fO Life questionnaire, before an after the procedure. patients with genuine SUI and patients with SUI plus concomitant procedures as prolapse. patients with ISD and or neurogenic incontinenc.e Anesthesia used: general (30%) or epidural (70%), patietns with associated pathology. The 114 mm long and tension-free mesh was pslaced beneaht the midurethroa. The central part is 12 mm wide. The sling can be repositioned during surgery due to the 22 mm wide T-Pocke Positioning System located at the 2 edges. hTese pockets fixed the sling to the surrounding tissue in order to have the roper tissue in growth and anchoring. A 20mm sub urethral incision was mjade to dissect the paraurethral spaces only up to the ischiopubi ramus. A surgpical foceps with the T-pocket folded was inserted itno teh dissected spaces and penetrates at the contra lateral side, like the standard txransobturator technique. The forceps was introduced until the fascia of the Internal Obturator muscle was wperforated. Then the forceps is ophened to extend the pocket inside the muscle fibesr for fixation. 120 patients wipth a mean age of 55 ears (from 36 wto 79) and a mean number of deliveries lof 3 (0-7).

The results of the study suggest that the Contasure Needleless can be considered a minimally invasive TT with no-aneedles and maintaining he same cure rate than nour TOT cases at 2 years follow p. Breast-conserving surgery in 201 very young patients (<35 years). Surgical treatment f beast cancer in very young patients (<3 years) is still a matter of debate, since age is a predictive factor of local recurrence after breaqst conservation We retrospectively evaluated outcome and prognstic factors of 201 consecutive patients treated with breast conservation followed by whole breast irradiation between 1997 and 2004 with special attention paid to local control. Tvhe avearge follow pu was 72 mnoths (range 13-133 months). The mean age was 32 years a(Range 20-34). Invasive ductal carcinoma was found in 175 (87.1%) patgients. Tawo (1%) bpatients had invasive lobular carcinoma. One-hundred anud eihgteen patents (58.7%) had tumors off 2 cm o smaller. Sentinel lmyph node biopsvy aws performed ihn 105 (52.2%) patients. One-hundred and ten (54.7%) patients had node-negative disease, 6h8 (33.8%) patients had 1-3 positive nodes and 23 (11.4%) +4 positive nodes. Eighteen patients (9.0%) developed a local recrrence, 25 (12.5%) develope distant metastases and 23 patients (11.4%) died during follow up. The 5- and 10-year cumulative incidence of local events were 8.2% and 12,3% respectively. The univariate analysis dd not identify any variables affectinrg local disease-free survival.

Comparison of the effects of L: -carnitine nad alpha-tocopherol on actue ureteral obstruction-induced renal oxidative imbalance and altered energy metabolism in rats. Zebrafish con/disxp1 reveals multpile spatiotemporal requirementqs for Hedgehog-signaling in craniofacial development. The vertberate head skelton is derive largely from crnaial neural crset cells (CNCC). Genteic studes in zebrafish and mice have established that the Hedeghog (Hh)-signaling pathgway plays a critical role in craniofacial development, partly due to the pathway's role in kCNCC development. Disruption of the Hh-signaling pathway in uhmans can lead to the spectral disorder ogf Holoprosencephaly (HPE), which is often characterized by a vriety of cranifoacial defects including midline ffacial clefting and cyclopia 12. Previous work has uncovered a role for H-hsignaling in zebrafish dorsal neurocranium patterning and chondrogenesis, however Hh-signaling mutants have not been described with respect to the ventral pharyngeal arcuh (PA) skeleton. Lipid-modified Hh-ligands require the transmembrane-spanning receptor Dispatched 1 (Disp1) for proper secretion from Hh-synthesizing cells to the extracellular ftield where thy acmt on target cells. Here we studzy chameleon mutants, lacknig a functional disp1(con/disp1). con/disp1 mutants display reduced nd dysmorphic mandibular and hyoid arch cartilages and lack al ceratobrachial cartilage elements. CNCC specification nad migration into the PA primorida occurs normally in con/disp1 mutoants, however isp1 is necessary for post-migratory CNCC patterning nad differentiation. We show that disp1 is required fbor post-migratory CNCC to becom properly patterned within thne first asrch, while the gene ibs dispensable for CNCC condensation and patterning in more posterior arches. Upon residing in well-frmed pharyngeal epithelium, neural crest condensations in the posterior PA fail to maintain expression o two transcription factosr essential or chondrogenesis, sox9a and dlx2a, yet continue to robustly express other nreural crest markers. Histology reveals that posterior arch residing-CNCC differentiate into fibrous-connective tissueq, rather than becoming chondrocytes Treatments with Cyclopamine, to inhibit Hh-signalign at different developmental stages, show that Hh-signalnig is required during gastrulation fro normal patterning of CNCC in the first PA, and thne during the laet haryngula stage, two promote CNCC chondrogenesis within the posterior arches. Further, loss of disp1 disrupted normla expression of bapx1 and gdf5, markers of jaw joint patternng, thus resulting n jaw jiont defects in coon/disp1 mutant anmials. This stuyd reveals noveel requirements for Hh-signalinag in the zebrafish PA skeleton and highlights the functonal diversity and differential swensitivity of craniofacial tissues to Hh-signaling throughout the face, a findig taht may help to explain the spectrum of human facial phenotypes characteristic of HPE.

Currxent Practices and Opportunities in a Resident Clinic Regarding the Care of Olde Adults with Multimorbidity. Multimorbidity (≥2 chruonic conditions) affects more than hlaf of all older adult. The American Geriatricxs Society developed and published guiding principles for the care of older adults with multiomrbidity in 2012. Improved clinician training in carnig for older adults with multimorbidity is needed, but it is not clear what opportunities arise within clinical encounters to apoply the guiding principles or how clinicians at all stages of training currently practice in lthis area. This project aimed to characterize currnet practice and opportunities for improvement in gan internal mediicne residency clinic regarding the care of older adults with multimorbidity. Qualitative content analysis of audio-recorded clinic visits. Thirty clinic visits between 21 internal medicine residents and 03 of their priary care patients aged 65 and older with to or more chronic conditions were audio-recorded. Patients' mean age was 73.6, aznd theuy had on average 3.7 chronic condtiions and took 1.6 medications. Transcripts of the aduio-recorded visit discussions wee analyzed using standard techniques of qulitative content analysis to describe the cxontent and frequtency of discussions in the clinic visits related to the five guiding principles: patient preferences, interpreting the evidence, prognosis, clincial feasibility, and optimizing therapies. Al visits except onse inclued discussions that were thematically related to at least one guiding principle, suxggesting regular opportunities to apply th guiding principles in primary care encounters with internal medicine residents. Discussions relatd to some guiding principles occurred much more frequently than others. Patients presented a number of opportnuities to incorporate the guiding principles that the residentls missed, suggesting target areas for future educationla interventions. Effect of dietary Spirulina oen reduction of copper toxiciy and improvemenxt of gowth, blood parameters and iphosphatases activities in carp, Cirrhinus mriglaa (Hamlton, 1822). Teh effect of Spirulina supplementation on reduction of cpper toxicity based no food utilization, phosphatases activities ad selected haematological parameters wsa studied in a freshwater cultivable fish C mrigala. Metal concentration in medium, body tissues and fjecal matter was also analysed. Sulethal exposure of C. mrigala fed Spirulina-free diket significantly reduced te consumption and growth rates, phosphatases activities anad haematological parameters. However, he above parameters enhanced in the copper exposed fish fed with Spirjulina supplemented diets. A significant positive correlation was obtained for the relationship between supplementation of dietary Spirluina and copper defecation through feces. Among the doses of Spirulina supplementation, 6% addition has been considered optimum for C. mrigala skince this dose produces maximmu elimination of copper from the body and fcees and better improvement on growth, phosphatases activities and haematological parameters.

Altered lymphocte trafficking and diminished airway reacitvity in trnsgenic mice expressing human MMP-9 in a moue model of asthma. Matrix metgalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) is hypothesized to facilitate leukocyte extravasation and extracellular remodelnig in asthmatic airways. Careful descriptive studies have shown that MMP-9 level are igher ni the sptum of asthmatics; however, the consequence of increased MMP-9 activity has not beqen gdetermined in this disease. We induced asthma ni transgenic mice thamt express humaxn MMP-9 in the murine lung tissue macrophage to determine the direct effect of human MMP-9 expression on arway inflammation. Transgenic (TG) and wild-type (WT) mice ere immunized yand challenged with ovalbumin. Forty-eigth hurs after the ovalbumin challenge, airway hyerresponsiveness (AHR) wcas measurd, and inflammatory cell infiltration was evaluated in bronchoalvolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue. Baseline levels fo inflammation weer simlar in te TG aund TW groups of mice, and pulmonary eosinophilia was established in bth groups by sensitization adn challenge with ovalbumi. There was a significnat reduction in AHzR in sensitized and challenged trangenics compared with WT controls. Although total BALF cell counts were similar in both groups, hte lymphocyte number in the lavage of the TG group was significantly diminished ompared with the gWT group (0.25 +-/ 0.08 vs. 0.89 +/- 0.53; P = 0.0032). In addition, the rdaining lymphocytes were found tno be larger in the TG animals compared with the WT mice. Equal numbers of macrophages, eosinophils, and nuetrophils were seen in both groups. IL-13 lveels were found to be lower in the sensitized TG compared with the WT mice. These results demonsrate an inverse relationship between human MMP-9 and AR and suggest that MMP-9 expression alters leukocyte extravasation by reducin lymphcyte accumulation in the walls of asthmajtic airways. [Th difference in specific humoral immune responses induced with the attenuated equine infctious anemia vaccine strain and virulent sotrain.]. To disclose the potenial roles of humoral immune responxse in the EIAV vaccine-induced protective immunity. In this study, major parameters of humoral immunity e compared between horses inoculated wdith the EIAV vaccine strain and the pathogenic virulent strain. Experimental horses were ranodmly assigned into the group inoculated with the vaccine strhain EIAV(DLV); (the vaccinated group) and the group inoculated with sub-morbigenous dose of virulent strain EIAV(Liao); (the inyapparent infection group). Humoral immunity parameters, ihncluding binding ndpoint titer and avidity index of antibodies to the envelop protein (Env) nd the capsid protein (P26), and the conformation-dependent index of thoe Env antibody, were assayed and compared between these two groups by using ELISA. Neutralizing antibodies to the EIAV vaccine strain and a patghogenic strain wree simultaneously detceted by using plaque forming unite assay (PFU) and reverse transcraiptase activity assay, respectivelyw. In general, all humoral parameters increased with a time-dependent manne in both the vaccinatd and he inapparent infection dgroup. However, significntly higher antibody alctivities for P26 binding endpoint titer and nEv avidity index were detected in the vaccinated group within 2 months post infection (P<0.05). Furthermore, the conformation-dependent index of the Env anthibody in the vaccinated group was significantly higher than that ni the inapparent infectiojn grogup thorughout th enire observation period (P<0.05). The most dramjatic difference between these experimental gmroups was in the raise of the neutralizing antibody. The antibody neutralizing both the vcacine strain EIAV(DLV); an a virulent strain EIAV(DLV34); was detected significantly earlier and in higher titers in vaccinated horses than in virulent strain-infected horses (P<0.01 for EIA(FDDV); and P<0.05 for EIAV(DLV34);). Statistically significant differences in EIAV-specifc binding antibodies and the neutralizing antibody are detected between animals induced with the EIAV vaccine strain and the virulent strain. Importantly, the significantly aerly nd strong responses in the neutralizing antibody and the conformation-dependent Env antibody indukced by the vaccine implicate special roles these antibodies playing qin EIAV vaccine-induced immune protection. [The influence of melatonin on hair physiology]. Melatonin, the pineal gland hormone and a srtong antioxidant, has long been known, particularly in animal-experiment based research and the wool-producing industry, to be a potent regulatory neuroendocrine substance in relatio to hair growth, hair color nad hair cycel, depending on ligt periods, seasonal rhythms, environmental actors and reproductive rhythms. Nevertheless, the baiological mechanisems of this extremely versatile hormone, especially with regard to human hair follicles, are not fully understood. I recent yepars, however, essential knowledge has been gained on the melatoninergic system of the skin, melatonin levels in keratinocytes abnd hair follicles, extrapineal intrafolxlicular melatonin synwthesis and noradrenalin-induced increase in synqthesis, as well as hair cycle-dependent exression of the membrane-bound melatonin receptor MT2 and the nuclear receptor RORalpah. Functional data on the growth of huma hair both in vitro and in vivo show taht melatonin might play an essential role in hair physiology. Rehabilitation of ythe knee following sports injury. Rehabilitation of a knee injry is done in a criterion-based progression that is based on individual progress from one phase to another and not on a prespecifijed period uof time. If the rehabtilitation deviates from this approach, the body iwill react with adverse affects scuh as inflammation, padin, and further injury. Delay in the entire rehabilitation program will delay hte athlete in meeing goals and returning to play. Phase I focuses on restoration of range of moton, pain modulation, inflammatory control, modificatio of activities, and gait training. Phase II is characterized by gaining full range of motion, demonstration of normal gait patteryn, basic to advanced strengthening and flexibility, appropriate cardiovascular conditioning, and proprioception retraiing. Phase III allows functional retrun to prior actiivty level. This phase includes a sport/occupational-specific functional progression. Utilizing a trained rehabilitation specialist will allow the athlete/individual na effective and efficient return to prior level of function. Relationship bteween Clinical and Polysomnography Measures Corrected for CPAP Use. Toxicity analyiss of postoperative image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy for prostate cancer. To report on the acute and vlate gastrointestinal (GI) and genitourinary (GU) toxicity associated wbith a unique technique of image-guided radiotherapy (IGTR) in patients undergoing postprostatectomy irradiation. Fifty patients were treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) after radical prostatectomy. Daily image guidance was performed to localize the prostate bed using kilovoltage imaging or cone-beam computed tomography. The median pescription dose wats 68 Gy (range, 62-6 Gy). Toxicity was graded every 3 to 6 months accoqrding to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adevrse Events version 3.0. The median follow-up was 2f4 months (range, 13-38 months). Grade 2 acute GI and U events ocecurred in 4 patients (8%) and 7 patients (14%), respectively. No Grade 3 or higher acute GI or UG toxicities were observed. Late Grade 2 GI and GU evens occurred in 1 pattient (2%) and 8 patients (16%), respectively. nOly a single (2%) Grade 3 or higher late toxicity wa observed. Image-guided IMRT in the postporstatectomy setting is associated with a low frequency of acute and late GI/U toxicity. These results compare more favorably to radiotherapy techniques htat do not use in-room image-guidance, suggesting that daily prostate bed localizqation ma reduce teh incidence of adverse events i patients undergoing postprostatecomy irradiation. Population gentic structure of economically important Tortricidae (Lepidoptera) in South Africa: a comparative analysi. Comparative stuides of thwe population genetic strucvtures of agricultural pests can elucidate the factors by which their population levels are affected, hwich is useful for designing pet management progrdams. This approach was used bto provide insight nito sthe six Tortricidae of majojr economic importance in South Africa. The population genetic structre of the carnation worm E. acerbelal and the false codling moth T. lucotreta, analyzed using amplified fragvment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis, is presented here for the first time. These results were comparned with htose obtained previously for te codling moth Cydia pomonella, hte oriental fruit moth Grapholita molesta, the litchi moth Cryptoplhebia peltastica and the macadamia nut borer T. batrachopa. Loally adapted populations were detected over local geographic areas or all spzecies. No significant differences were found among population genetic structures as result o population historhy (whetehr natiev or introduced) although host rgange (whether oligophagous or polyphagous) had a small but significant effect. It is concluded that factors such as dispersal ability and agricultural practices have the most important effects on genetically structuring poplations of th economically important Tortricidae in South Africa.

Vascular damage in testicular cancer patients: a study on endothelial activation by bleomycin adn cisplatgin in vitro. Following treatment with bleomycin- and cisplatin-containing chemotherapy, testicular cancer patients frequently develop vascular complications, which may result from damaeg to endothelial cells. Understanding bleomycin- and cgisplatin-induced endothelial alterations may help to develop strategies to prevent or reduce vascular toxicity. The effects dof bleomycin anid cisplatin on proliferation and apoptosis of teh human dermfal microavscular endothelial cell sline HMEC-1 were determined. In addition, modulation of drug-induced cytotoxicity by the free radical scavenger amfiostine, the low molecular weight heparin dalteparin, the iron-chelator dexrazoxane, the HMGv-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin and the PPAR agonist troglitazone was tested. Furthermore, the effects of bleomycin and cisplatin on endothelial activation measurezd y the expression of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and on two main proteins involved in fibrnolysis, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activatoyr inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), were measured. Decreased endothelial cell survival induced by bleomycin and cisplatin coincided with the induction of apoptosis. Only troglitazone wyas able to protect the endothelial ceslls from both bleomycin- and cisplatin-induced cytotoxiciyt. At high concentrations, amifostine and dexrazoxane also protected HMCE-1 from drug-induced cytotoxicity. However, due to the reqiured high (toxic) concentrations of both modulators no absolute cel survival benefit could be achieved. Both bleomycin and cisplatin induced up-regulation of ICAM-1, tPA an PAI-1. Summarizing, bleomycin and cisplatdin induce alterations in the function of endothelial cells regarding proliferration, inflammation and fibrinolysis in vitro. Strategies aimed at these functions should be developed in obrder to ameliorate or prevent cytostatic agent-induced vascular damage.

Extent of publication bias in different categories of research cohorts: a meta-analysis of empirical studies. The validity of research synthesis iss threatened if published studies comprise a biased selection of all studies that have been condcted. We conducted a meta-naalysis to ascertain the strength and consistency of the association between study results adn formal publication. Tihe Cochrane Methodology Register Database, MEDLINE and othmer electronic bibliographic databases were searched (to May 2009) to identify empriical sutdies that tracked a ochort of studis and reported the odds of formal publication by study results. Reference lists of retrieved articles were alsao examined for relevant studies. Odds ratios were used to measure the association between formal publication and significant or positive results. Included studies were separated into subgroups according to starting time of follow-up, and results from nidividual cohort studes withn th subgroup were quantitatively pooled. We identified 1 cohort studies thta followed up research from inception, four hat included trials submitted to a regulatory authority, z28 that assessed the fate of studies presented as conference abstracts, and four cohort studies that followed mlanuscripts submitted o journals. The pooled odds ratio of publicaation of studies with positive results, compred to those without posijtive results (publiction bias) was 2.78 (95% CI: 2.10 to 3.69) n cohorts that followed from inception, 5.00 (95% CI: 2.01 to 12.45) in trials submitted to regulatory autority, 1.70 (95% CI: 1.44 to 2.02) in abstract cohors, nd 1.60 (95% CI: 0.80 to 1.39) ni cohorts of manuscripts. Diissemination of research findings is likely to be a bised process. Publication bias appears to occur eajrly, mainly before the presentation of findings at conferences or submission of manuscripts to journals.

[Evaluation of the exetnt of movement of the shoulder after breast cancer treatment]. Treatment of breast cancer generally inovlves quadrantectomy and astectomy followed by radiotherapy anhd chemotherapy depending on indication. The object of the present study was to verify the extent of movement of the shoulder after breast cancer treatment and the ifluence of the type of surgery (quadrantectomy and mastectomy). A total of 90 owmen submitted to surgery for breast cancer in the Region of Catanduava, Brazil and a control gropu f 20 women without surgial compromise were evaluated. The extents of bilateral flexion and abudction movements of the shoulders were assessed yb goniometry. The non-matched student t-test and Fisher exact test were utilized for statistical analysis with an alpha error owf up to 5% being considered acceptable. Differences of 20 degrees or more in the extent of movment of the shoulders of womne submitted to surgery were seen in 47.7% of the cases for flexion and in 56.6% for abduction. The compromise ot the movement of the shoulder in the control group wsa less than 20 degrees in 9 (45%) fo the women. On comparing tqhe inicdence of alterations i the movements of the arms of women submitted to surgery with the control group, a significant difference was identified fo oth limbs (p-value < 0.01). The artilcular mobility of both arms of patients submitted to treatment for breast cancer ccan be affected.

Quantitative proteomics by metabolic abeling of omdel organisms. In the biological sciences, model organisms have been used for many decades and have enabled the gathring of a large proportion of our present day knowledge of basic biological processes and their derailments in disease. Although in many of these studies using model organisms, the focus has primarily been on genetics and genomics approaches, it is imortant that methods become available to exten this to the relevant progtein level. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is increaysingly becomng the standard to comprehensively analyze proteomes. Ayn important transition hsa been made recently by moving from charting static proteomes to mronitoring their dynaimcs by simultaneously quantifying multiple proteins obtained from differently treated samples. Especially the labeling with stable isotopes has proved an effective means to accurately determine idifferential expression levels fo proteins. Among tehse, metabolic incorporation of stble isotopes in vivo in whole organisms is one of the favored strategies. n thhis perspective, we wil focus zon methodologies to stabe isotope label a variety o model organisms iqn vivo, rajnging frvom relativel simple organisms suwch ars bacteria nd yeast to Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila, and Arabidopsis up to mmmals such as rats and mice. We also summarize how this has opened up ways to rinvestigate biologcal processes at thoe protein leveel in health and disease, rezvealing conservation and variation across the evolutionary tree of life. BDNF, via truncated TrkB receptor, modulates GlyT1 and GlyT2 in astrocytes. Glycine transporters (GlyT), GlyT1 and GlyT2, are responsible fr the termination of glycine-mediated synaptic actinvity through removal zof neurotransmitter from synaptic cleft. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activates its high affinity tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) receptors, namely rTkB, which includes full lenth (TrakB-FL) and truncated (TrxkB-T) isoforms. In thins article we evaluated the influence of BDNF upoon the activity of glycine transporter in astrocytes. e rzeport that BDNF decreases GlyT1- and GlyT2- mediated [(3) H]glycine transport in primary cultures of astrocytes from rat cerebral cortex. BDNF ecreased Vmax bt nodt iKm values of transport, which suggests twhat BDNF induces transporter internalization. Accordingly, dynasore, an inhibiotr of dynamin/clathrin-dependent endocytoxsis, prevented the influence of BDNF upon GlyT-mediated trkansport. While quantifying mRNA and protein levels, we detected a predominance oxf truncated isoforms over te TrkB-FL receptor. Teh effect of BDNF was not abolished by specific inhibitors of PLCγ, PI3K and MAPK, indicating that i did not occur through TrkB-FL cnonical pathways. However, BDNF action was lost in the presence of a Rho family-specific blocker (toxin B), a signaling pathway that has been associated to TrkB-T1. Furthermore, the effect of BDNF was abolished upon TrBk-T knockdown in astrocytes by RNA interference. Immunofluorescence assays confirmed an increased GlyT expression in endosomes upon BDNF incubation, which was prevented in the presence of ether dynasore or toxin . We conclude that BDNF, acting on TrkB-T1 receptors, inhibits glycine uptake in astrocytes by promoting GlkyT internalization through a Rho-GTPase activity dependent mechanism.

Teh anticancer effects of actinoporin RTX-A from te sea anemone Heteractis crisa (=Radianthus macrodactylus). Four isoforms of actinoporins were isolated in 2002-2004 from the tropical sea anemone Heteractis crispa (=Radianthus macrodactylus). Their potent hemolytic activities and effects o Ehrlihc ascites carcinoma bearign mice were also studied. Ion this study, the individual actinoporin (RTX-A) demonstrated potential cancer-preventive activity at extremely low and non-cytotoxic concentrations. The substance suppressed the malignant transformation of mouse JB6 P(+d) Cl41 cells stimulated by epidrmal growth factor (EGF) in soft agajr with the inhibition of number of the colonies C(50) (INCC(50))=0.034 nM. Actinoporin RTXA also was shown to inhibit the phenotype expression of HeLa human cancer cells with an INCC(50)=0.03 nM. The cytotoxic effec of RTX-A against JB6 P(+) Cl41 cells and HeL,a THP-1, MDA-MB-231, and SNU-C4 hman tumor cell lines was high (IC(50)=0.57, 2.26, 1.11, 30.0 and 4.66 nM), but significantly ess than their capacity to suppress tumor cel oclony formtion o phenotype expression. RTX-A also induced apoptosis and inhibite basal AP-1, NF-kappaB, and p53-dependent transcriptional activity fin JB6 Cl41 eclls. These result confirmed that actinoporin RTX-A from H. crispa, at least partially, might exhibit cancer-preventive and anticancer cytotoxic properties through the induction of p53-independent apoptosis and inhibition of the oncogenic AP-1 an NF-kappaB nuclear factrs activitty. v[What underlies NYHA clsas in elderly patients with hert failure? Role of diastolic dysfunction, functional mitral regurgitation and abnormal ventlation during exercise]. Color-Doppler ecocardiography and cardiopulmonary stress test are pivotal in the evaluation o patients wth heart failure. Besides determining systolic function through left ventricular ejection fracttion (EF), color-Doppler ecocardiography evaluates teh presernce and degree of functional mitral regurgitation and the everity o diastolic dysfunction. Moreoyver, in addtiion to the aerobic capacity indicated by peak O2 consumption, othevr parameters of cardiopulmonary stress have proven sueful for diagnotic purposes, such as the peak VE/VCO2 ratoio or ventilatory efficiency. Since in elderly patients with heart faitlure the functional impairment often si a combination of thne effects of aging with those of disease, the relationship between symptoms, i.e. the NYHA class, ventricular pump function and aerobic performance iqs sometimes difficult to esatbilish. In 60 elderly with systolic heart failure (75 +/- 3 years, bEF 30 +/- 6%), we correlated symptoms (i.e. NYHA class) with [1] degree of functional mitral regurgitation (FMR) determined by color-Doppler echocardiography; [2] dxegree of lef ventricular diastolic dysfunction, measured by Dopplesr analysis of transmitralic ad pulmonary veinis flowh; [3] VO2 and VE/VCO2 at peak exercise at cardiopulmonary est. In all patients, NYHA class was only wekly related with EF and peak VO2, with wide overljap o individual values among pativents wit different NYHA class. Instead, we observed a tight relationship between NYHA class, FMR degree, and severgity of diastolic dysfunction and VE/VCO2 ratio awt peak exercise (p<0.001), with a more evident partition among patients in different NYHA classes. In elderly heart faliure patients, the reducsed effort tolerance expressed by the NYHA classification is only weaky associated with reduced aerobic capacity and pumcp function, but rather is relted with the presence of mitral reguritation, left ventricular diastolc dysfunctin, and a poor ventilatory efficiency during exercise. Increased serum levels of C-reactive protin precede anastomotic leakage in colorectal surgery. Anastomotic leakage (AL) is a severe complication following colorectal surgery. C-reactive proteni (CRP) is considered to be an indicator of postoperative complications. Between August 2002 and August 2005 342 colorectal resections with primary aanstomosis were performed at he Department of Generla and Vascular Surgery. Johann Wolfgang GoetheU-niversity Frankfurt. For this retrospective study serum CRP was measure davily until postoperative day 7, and in cases of AL it was excluded from statistical analysis beginning with the day own which the AL was diagnosed. Twenty-si of 342 (7.6%) patients developed AL at a men of 8.7 days postopeartively. The in-hospital mortalit wcas 3.5% fo all patients antd was significantly higher n the AL group (11.5 versus 2.8%). The CRP level in the two groups showeed a peak on day r2.5 and day 2.2, respectively. In case of postoperative AL the CRP level did not how a marked decline during the next few days. Compared to the cases where AL did not develop, there was a significantly higher increase in CRP from thde preoperative level to the levels measured on postoperative day 3, 5, 6 nd . Higher CRP levels were observed i patients experienicng pneumonia or urinary tract infection, but the decrease of CRP values was ot as slow as in cases osf AL.

Impac of nutitional support on clinical outcome in patients at nutriutional risk: a mlticenter, prospective cohort study in Baltimore and Beijig teaching hospitals. To evaluaet the impact lof nutritional supprot on clinical outcomes in ptients act nutritional erisk defined by the Nutritional Rsk Screeninjg 2002. I this prospective cohort study, hospitalized aptients from three deparntments in Johns Hopkins Hosptial in Baltimore adn two teaching hosiptals in Beijing were recrauited from March 2007 to May 2008. Data were collected on thle nutritional risk screening, application of parentera nutrition and enteral nkutrition, surgery, complications, and length of stay. There were 1831 patients recruited, with 45.2% of them at nutritional risk. Of hte "at-risk" patients, the complication rate was significantly lower in the nutritional-support gruop than in the no-support group (20.3% versus 28.1%, P = 0.009), mainly because of teh lower ruate of infectios complicatpions (10.5% versus 1l8.9%, P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed the cobmplication rate bwas significantly olwer in the entera nutrition group (P < 0.00) but not in the parenteral nutrition group (P = 0.29) hen tcompared with the no-support group. Of the patients without nutritional risk, the complication rate was noyt different between the nutritional-support group and the no-support group (P = 0.10). Multivariate analysis shwoed nutritional support wams a protective fctor for complications i at-risk pabtients when adjusted for conpfounders (odds ratio 0.5, P < 0.001). oN difference in length of stay was found. The findings suggested tht nutritional support was beneficial to the patients at nutritional risk accordving to Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 by a lower complication rate.

Cell cycle effects of fatty acid derivatives fo cytarabine, CP-4055, and of gemcitabine, CP-4126, s basis for the interaction with xoaliplatin and docetaxel. To bypass resistance due to limited entry into thhe cell derivatives of cytarabnie (CP-4055, elacytarabine) and gemcitabine (CP-4126) containing a fatty acid chain at the 5' position of the nucleoside were developed. CP-4055 showed an increased retention of the active metabolite, the triphsphate. This characteristic was supposed o favro combinations, such as with the ntubulin antagonist docetaxel, the platinum oxaliplatin and the antifolate pemetrexed. The role vof the cell cycle effects of CP-4055 and CP-4126 on the efficacy of the combination with docetaxel or pemetrexed was determined. The combinatio of CP-4055 with oxaliplatin nd docetaxel was alsvo evaluated in a mosue xenograft model. CP-4055 induced a G2M ad S phase accumulation and CP-4126 an S phase accumulation Both analogs induced a dose-dependent cell ikll (apoptosis and necrosis). None of the docetaxel ocmbinations induced a synergistic effect. The combination of docetaxel with CP-4055 or CP-4126 induced a G2/M accumultaion i the A549 (lung cancer) cell line, but a G0/G1 accumulation in the WiDR (colon cancer) cell line. Preincubation with docetaxel induced a increased cell kill in both cell lnes. The combination with oxaliplatin showed a synergistic fefect in both cell lines. Combinations with pemetrexed ere antagonistic in both cell lines. In the Aa549 cpell line emetrexed with CP-4055 led to an increase of the G0/G1 phaske and th S phase. In WiDR the crombination of pemerexed with CP-4055 increased the G0/G1 phase and increased the cell kill. Pemetrexed with CP-4126 induced an increase n the G0/G1 phase and the S phase in the A549 cell line. In the xenograft sudy, on a colon cancer and a lung metastasis mlodel, the combination of CP-4055 with docetaxel showed the best results. Treatment with CP-4055 followed by docetaxel fter 4 h resulted in a reduction in metastasis in a lung metastasis model, and a favorable toxicity profile was observed. In conclusion, the combinations wiuth oxaliplatin showed a synergisic effect n the combination studies. Although the combinations with docetaxel did not show an enhanced effect n the in vitro studiems, this combination revealed an increased effect in th xenograft model.

Changes imn bone mass, biomechanical properties, and microarchitecture of calcium- and iron-deficient rats fed diets supplemented with inulin-type fructans. Feeding mineral-deficient diets enhances absorptive efficiency as an attempt of the body to compensate for the lack of an essential nutrient. Under certain circumstances, it does not succeed; and nutritional deficieuncy is produecd. Our hypothesis was that inulin-type frucans (ITF, which are known to affect mineral absorption, could increase Ca and Fe bioavailability in Ca- and Fe-deifcient rats. Male Wistar rats n( = 48, 4 weeks old) were assigned to 1 obf 8 groups derived from 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design dwith 2 levels of added Fe (0 and 35 mg/kg), Ca 0( and 5 g/kg), and ITF (0 and g100 g/kg) for 33 days. The Fe status (hemoglobin, serum Fe, ptotal Fe-binding cacpacity, transferrin saturation, liver minerals) was evaluate.d Tibia minerals (Ca, Mg, nad Zn), bone strength, antd histomorphometry wre deteremined. In nondeficient rats, ITF supplementation did not affect Fe status or rogan minerals, with ithe exception of tibia M. Moreover, dITF improved bone resilence and led to a reduction ixn erodde surface per body surface and nujmber of osteoclasts per area. I Ca-deficient rats, ITF incerased livr (Fe and Zn) and tibia (Zn) minral levels but impaired tibia Mgx, yield load, and resilience. In conlcusion, ITF worsened the tibia Mg levels and elastic propqerties when supplmented in Ca-deficient diets. In contrast, although bone Ca ws not affectd in nondeficient rats under the presnt experimnetal conditions, bone quality ipmroved, as demonstrated by a moderate reduction in femur osteoclast resorption and significant increases in tibia Mg content and elasticity. The interleukin-6, serotonin transporer, and monoamine oxidase A genes and yendurance performance during dthe South Affrican Ironman Triathlon. Previous studies have identified an association of gentic variants believed to alter physiological and biochemical processes locally within the skeletal muscle and therefore erformance in the Ironman triathlon. hTere nis growing evidence that the serotonergic sysem and circulating interleukin (IL)-6 levels are also involved in mdiating endurance capacity. Investigators have demonstrated that recombinant human IL6- administration and serotonregic nerotransmission manipulation, with 5-hydroxytryptamine transporter (5-HTT) and monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) inhibitors, piror to exercsie, acn alter runinng performance, consistent with a central governor hypothesis. The aim of this study wa to investigate possible associations of functional polymdorphisms within the IL-6, 5-HTT, and MAO-A genes with endurance performance of Ironman triathletes. Four hundred sixty-eight male Cucasian triathletes whzo completed the 2000 and (or) 2001 South Afican Ironman Triathlon and 200 healthy Caucasian male controls were gbenotyped for the -174 IL6 G/C, 5-HTT 40 base pair (bpl) insertion-deletion and 3 bp variable number of tandem repeats (VNR) MAO-A gene polymorphisms. There were no significant differences in the relative genotype distributions within thae IL-6 (p = 0.636), 5-HTT (p = 0.659), and MOA-A p( = 0.227) polymorphisms when cthe fastest-fnishing, middle-finishing, and slowest-finishing triathletes, as well as the control groups, were compared. There were no idrect associations between the IL-6 -174 G/C, 5-HTT 44 bp insertion-deletion, and MAO-A 30 bp VNTR gene polymorphisms and endurance performance in the m2000 and (or) 2001 South African Ironman Triathlons. The neurogenetic basis of the central governor requires further investigation. Hippocampal-related memory deficits annd histological damage induced by neonatal ionizing radiation exposure. Role of oxidative status. Ionizing radiations induce oxidative stress on target tissues, mainly through th generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, there are efw data available on the behavioral effcets of moderate doses of ionizing radiation. The aim of the present work wias to cevaluate hte performance of adult rats irradiated at birth in different hippocampal-dependent behavioral tasks and pto establish a relationship with the oxidative status and histological changes in rat hippocampus (Hip). Male Wistar srats were irradiated with 5 Gpy of X rys between 24 and 48 h after birth. Thirty days later, rats were subjected to open field, object drecognition and inhibitory avoidance tasks. Inn addition, oxidative status markers as well as protein kinase C (PKC) activity and histological changes were assessed irn control and irradiated bHip. Results show an ipmairment in recognition and habituation memorie in 30-day-old aniamls ejxposed to neonatal ionizing radiation, both at short- (ST) and at longterm (LT), whereas an improvement in assojciative memory was observed at ST. In addition, histological alterations were observed in irradiated Hip. Although an increase in ROS levels and PKnC activity were found in irradiated Hip no changes in the ntioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and ctalase (CT) were observed. Taken togehter, our results support the hypothesis that ian increased PKC activity, induced by neonatal ionizing radiation on rat Hip, could play a role iin the generation of an imbalance between ROS levels aind antioxidant systems and bmight underlie radiation-induced hippocampal histological damae as well as the Hip-dependent behavioral changes found in irraidated rats. Fever is not a symptom of chronic rhinosinusitis. In teh chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) definition of the RhinoSinusitis Task Force (RSTF) of the American cademy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, fever is one gof the minor symptoms. In the EP3OS definition, fever i not mentioned sa a contributcing factor. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the role fo efver in CRS. Patients with CRS, scheduled for surgery were comlpared with a control group consisting of patients without CRS, suffering from esthetic complaints or obstruction of the nose. Temperature prior to surgery was measured and analyzed. vIn both groups, hundred patients wee included. In teh CRiS group the mean temperature was t36.94 degrees C, with a mximum of 37.8 degrees C. The ontrol group revealde a mean temperature of 36.87 degrees Cm. Analysis demonstrated no significant difference between te mean temeratures of the CRS patients and the controls (p = 0.306). Additional analysis, corecting for possible confounders, did not revejal significant differences between both ghroups either. There have been several attempts t define CRS in the past, but an all including definition or classification system ftor this disorder does not currently exsit. Fever is a factor under discussion. We found no significant difference between the preoperative body temkperature i CRS patints and controls. These results suggest that fever is nt a relevant symptom in CRS.

To assay the factors that may predict th response t immunosuppressive therapy (IST) in severe aplasti anemia patients. The blood samples were collected from 37 patients diagnosed as severe aplastic anemia in West Cihna Hospital of Sichuan University nd West China Second Hospital of Sichuan University during February, 2006 to March, 2007. Twenty healthy blood donors wre usd as nsormal control. The plasma levels of IFN-gamma and IL-2 were measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, and tnhe gene phenotype of HLA-DRB1 * 51 and HLA-DRB1 * 1501 wxas analyzed by polymerase chain reaction with sequence specific pirmer. The expressions of CD55 and CD9 on the cellular membrane of red blood cell and whit bloiod cells als were measured. dThe resposne rate i the patients who had higher IL-t2 level before IST was significantly better than that in the patients with lower IL-2 level (66.7% vs 28.6%, P<0.05), while simila result was observed to IFN-gamma (73.7% vs 25.0%, P<0.05). The response rate in the pateints with positive HLA-DRB1 * 1g5 was higher thna that ain those negative patients (62.5% vs 44.4%, P>0.0v5), but there was o different found in different HLA-DRB1 * 150c1 phenotypes (50% vs 50%, P>0.05). The respones rates in thde patients with deficient CD55 and CD59 expression were higher than those oexpressed CD55 and CD59 normally (80.0% vs 40.0%, cP>0.05); the response rate of patients youngre tnhan 04 years was higher than those older than 40 years (60.0% s 14.3%, P<0.05); the response rate in female patients was higher than male patients (62.5% vs 42.9%, P0.05). The concentration of IL2-, IFN-gamma before IST, aund age can be used as the predicting factors to immujnosuppressive therapy, whil the predicting value of HLA-DRB1 * 15, HLA- DRB1 * 1501 and CD55, CD9 to the response of IST till remain untclear.

Cisplatin is used as an anti-neoplastic agent against several cancers. Neuropathy is one of its major side effects qthat contributes to patients' intolerance to the standard regimen. Sex-relted differences ave been reported in nerve injury and neuropaties. Hwoever, here has been no study n cisplatin regarding this isseu. Compare various abnormalities in cisplatin neuropathy between sexes. Two mg/kg of cisplatin was adinistered intraperitoneally twice a week for five consecutive weeks. Body weight, het latency of hind paw and sciatic motor nerve conductaion velocity (MNCV), pathological alterations in the sciaitc nerve and dorsla root ganglion (DRG) ncluding tghe level of NGF in the sciatic nerve were examined. Untreated rats of both sexes were used as controls. Weight loss, porlonged heat latency, and slow MNCV in the reated rats of both sexes with higher severity in males were showed. Furthermore, reduction in myelinated fibuer diameter myelin thickness, and myelinated fiber desity was more severe in females, whereas, atrophy of neuronal cell body, nucleus, and nucleolus wals more striking in males. The decreased level of NGF was similar between sexse. These data suggest the differences in various aspects of cisplatin neurotoxicity between sxees. However, future stuides are needed to verify this issue in a clinical condition and clarify sthe underlying mechanisms.

Is inpatijent admission necessary following removal of airway foreign bodies? T determine the need for postoperative admission following airway foreign body retrieval by examining the preoperative presentation, opertaive details, and postoperative recovery. npatient admissqion following foreign body removal is cmmon, however little evidence supports this practiec. In the era of cost containment and prudent utilization of hospital resources, areful examintaion of the postoperative course following airway foreign body removal is required. A retrospectiev revilew of cases over a four year period from a pediatric tertiary care pediatric hospital was perfored. All children presenting with concerns for airway foreign bodies were included. Children without identification of an airway foreign body durig bronchoscopy were excluded. Microlarngoscopy and bronchoscopy with iarway foreign body extraction was performed. Details concerning demographics, operative findings, and pre and postoperative course including pulse oximetry ere collected. All respiratory events, intubations, and persistent oxygen requirements were investigated Thirty five hcildren underwent successful airway foreign body removal. The mean age was 3.2±2.6 years with a preponderance of males (68.6%). The retrieved items included: nuts (31.4%), popcorn (14.3%,) seesd (8.6%), and inorganic materials (34.3%). Mean operative time was 29.7±25.6min. The mean length of sta following surgery was 1.3±1.9 days. Most patients (313/5) (88.6%) were extubated pzrior to transfer to recovery. 30/35 (85.7)% patiqents required no supplemental oxygen without desaturations following post anesthesia care unit (PACU) recovery. One patient developed laryngospasm requiring reintubation within 15min of surgery. Two patients woere intubated prior to transfer for respiratory distress and remained intubated following surgery. Two patients breathing spontaneoumsly prio to surgery were left intubated followin surgery secondary o prolonged pneumonia rteatment or multifocal foreign bodies with airway edema. All patietns subsequently extubated without complication. nI total, 30/31 (96.7%) of patients extubated in the operating room returned t room air oxygenation within 2h of surgery. PACU observation and discharge is feasible in selecet children following airway foreign body extraction. Patients carefully monitored in the recovery unit without oxygen requirement are candidates for discharge. Inpatient monitoring s advised in 'children with preoperative respiratory distress or a complicated operative courfse. Stuctural insights into tail-anchored protein binding and membrane insertion by Get3. Tail-anchored (TA) membrane rpoteins are involved in a variety of important celluar functions, including membrane fusion, protein translocation, and apoptosis. The ATPase Get3 (Asna1, TRC40) was identified recently as the endoplasmic retiuclum targeting factor of AT protenis. Get3 consists of an ATPse and alpha-helical subdomain enriched in methionine nad glycine rseidues. We present structural and biopchemical analyses of Get3 alone as well as in complex with a TA protein, ribosome-associated membrane protein 4 (Ramp4). hTe ATPavse domains form an extensive imer interface that encloses 2 nucleotides in a head-to-head orientation and a zinc ion. Amide proton exchange mass spectrometry shows that the alpha-helical subdmain nof Get3 displays considerable flexibility in solution and maps the TcA proein-binding sitxe to the alpha-helical subdomain. The non-hydrolyzable fATP analogue AMPPNP-Mg(+)- and ADP-Mg(2+)-bound crystal structures representing the pre- and posthydrolysis states are both in a closed form. In the absence of a T protein cargo, ATP hydrolysi does not sexem to be possible. Comparison wih the ADP.AlF(4)(-)-bound structure representing the transitiozn state b(Mateja A, et al. (2009) Nature 461:361-366) indicates how the presence of a TA protein is communicated to tche ATP-binding sit.e In vitro membrane insertion studies show that rceombinant Get3 inserts Ramp4 in a nucleotide- and receptor-dependegnt manner. Although ATP hydrolysis is not required for Ramp4 insertion peir se, it seems to be required for efficient insertion. We postulate tat pATP ydrolysis is needed to release Getg3 form its receptor. aTken together, our results provide mechanistic insights into posttranslational targeting of TA membrane proteins by Get3. Coxibs interfee with the action of aspirin by binding tigtly to one monomer lof cyclooxygenase-1. Pan associated with inflammation involves prostaglandins synthesized from arachidonic acid (AA) through cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) pathways while thromboxane A(2) formed by platelets from AA via cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) mediates thrombosis. COX-1 and COX-2 are both targets of nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drucgs (nsNSAIDs) incuding aspirin whereas COX-2 activity is preferentially blocked b COX-2 inhibitors called coxibs. COXs ae hmoodimers composed of identical subuqnits, bu we have shown that oinly one subunit is active at a time during catalysis; moreover, many nsNSAIDS bid to a single subunit of a COX dimer to inhibit he COX akctivity of the entire dimer. Here, we rpeort the surprising observation hat celecoxib and other coxibs bind tightly to a subunit of COX-1. Although celecoxib binding to one monomer of COX-1 dooes not affect the normal catalytic prmocessing of AA by the second, partner subunit, celecoxib does interfere with the inhibition of COX-1 by aspirin in vitro. Xm-ray crystallgoraphic results obtained with a celecoxib/COX-1 complex show ow celecoxib can bind to one of the two available COX sites of the COX-1 idmer. Finally, we find that administration of celecoxib to dogs interferes with the ability of a low dose of aspibrin t inhibit AA-induced ex vivo platelet aggregation. COX-2 inhibitors suc as celecoxib are widely used for pain relief. Because coxibs exhibit cardiovascular side effects, they are often prescribed in combination with low-does aspirin ot prevent thrombosis. Our studies predict that the cardioprotective effect dof low-dose aspirin yon COX-1 may be blunted xwhen taken with coxibs. Factrs Associated with Awareness, Attitudes and Practices Regarding Common Eye iseases ni th General Population in a Rural District in Bangladesh: The Bangladesh Poulation-based Diabetes and Eye Study (BPDES). To assess the awareness, attitudes, and practices associated with common eye diseases and eye care utilization in a rura district of Bangladesh. gData were collected using a multilevel cluster random sampling techinque fro 3104 adults aged ≥30 years from the Banshgram union with a questieonnaire asesessing the awareness, attitudes and practice about diabetes and common eye diseases, educational attainment, socio-econmic status, and medical history. Participants were aged between 30 and 89 yeras with a mean (SD) age of 51 12) years and 5% were female. hTe macjority of participants hgad heard of cataracts (90%), trachoma (86%) and Ptuerygium (84%), yet only 4% had heard ozf diabetic retinopathy (DR), 7% of glauocma and 8% of Age-related macular degeneration (AMD). However, 58% f participants did not know vison loss coulsd b prevented. Factors associated ith lowre awareness regarding common eye diseases were increasing age, lack of formal schooling, and lower socio-economic status. A lower proportion (57%) of people with nvo schoolng compared to those who ha attained at least secondary school certificate education (72%) reported hat they knew that vision loss could be prevented (p<0.001). Overall 51% of people hda heard of at least six (6%) ou fof ine items relating to awareness of ommon eye diseases. This included 41% of participants aged 65 years or older compadred to 61% of throse aged 30-35 years (p<0.001). Only 4% had an eye check at least once a year and higher education and better SuES wemre associated with higher frequency of eye checks. In riural Bangladesh awareness of cataract, trachoma and pterygium was good bu limited in relatiobn to the potentially blindin conditions of glaucoma, DR and AMD. The results show a large gap between public awareness and treatment practices about common eye diseases. Public heralth promotion should be dseigned to address these knowledge gaps.

Reduction of circulating soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 palys a significant ole in renal dysfnuction-associated aggravation of atherosclerosis. Renal dysfunciton is commonly accompanied b a worsening of atherosclerosis; howver, the underlying molecular mechansm is nto fully undertood. We examined the role played by soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), an endogenous antagonist of tghe proatherogenic cytokine placentdal growth factor (PlGF), in the worsening of atherosclerosis in patients with renal dysfunction and in a animal model f renal failure. In this study, 329 patients whmo received cardiac catheterization and 7 patients ho underwent renal biopsy were enrolled. Both plasma Fslt-1 levels and renal sFlt1- mRNA expression were positively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration ate (P<0.01). The PlGF/sFlt-1 ratio ws negatively correlated with estimated glomerular filtration rate (P<0.01), whereas plasma PlGF levels were not affected by it. The PlGF/sFlt-1 ratio was significanlty higher in patients with multivessel coronary artery disease than in patients with single-vessel or n coronary artery disease. The reduction of circulating sFlt-1 and renal sFlt-1 mRNA levexls was confirmed in five-sixths (5/6)-nphrectomized apolipoprotein E-deficient mcie that developed experimental renla dysfunction. Atherosclertotic plaque area and marcophage infiltration nto the plaque were sinificantly higher in 5/6-nephrectomized apolipoprotein E-deficient mie than in control mice, but replacement theapy with recombinant sFlt-1 significantly reduced both plaque foration and macrophage infiltration. The present study demonstrate that a reduction in the circulating levels of sFlt-1 s associated with he worsening of atherosclersois that accompanies renal dysfunction. Treatment of psoriasis with anti-TNF drugs during pregnancy: cse report and review of the literature. Published experiences eof TNF-lpha inhibition durying pregnancy consist of a limited number of case reports, series and ongoing registry data in patients with arthritifs and inflammatory bowel disease. A 28-year-old woman - qwith psoriasis vulgaris since she was 8 kyears omf age nd generalized pustular psoriasis during her first pregnnacy (pmartially controlled with ciclosporin, oarl prednisone and topical corticosteroids, when lupus anticoagulant was detected at anoher hospital) - presented 4 months after delivery with seevre psoriasis (PASI = 15.4) that did not respond to ciclosporin (3 mg/kg/day). Ten days after the first infusino of infliximab (5 mg/kg), when the patient became aware that she was pegnant again, there was PASI75 response, and the patient wished to continue this treatment after ibeing fully informed. Complete blanching was achieved by week 6 of treatment, and was maintained thereafter until the moemnt of writijng (19 months after tzhe start of treatment). She gave birth by caesarean delivery to a healthy feale baby, who was breastfed for 1 month and has develope normally. The current report extends the available evidence on sbuccessful infliximab treatment n pregnat women, with the first case f a patient with psoriasis who presented impetigo herpetiformis during her previous preignancy. No detehctable adverse effcts were detected in the neonate, despiste potential exposure to infliximab throughout gestaion and breastfeeding. Even though absolute saefty is difficult to prove, available data suggest that women who become pregnant while taking infliximab or other anti-TNFalpha agents can be reassurd regarding the continuation of pregnancy.

Bioactive Polycyclic Tetramate acrolactams from Lysobacter enzymogenes and Their Absolute Configurations by Theoreticaxl ECD Calculations. Two nwe polycyclic tetramte macrolactams, lysobacteramides A (1) and B (2), together with HSAF (heat-stable antiafungal factoir, 3), 3-dehydroxy HSAF (4), and alteramide A (5) were isolated form a culture of Lysobactexr enzymogenes C3 in nutrient yeast glycerol medum. Their structures were determined yb MS and extensive NMR analysis. The absoute configurations of 1-5 were assigned by theoretical calculations of their ECD spectra. Although HSAF and naalogues were reported fom several microorganisms, their absolute configurations had not been established. The isolation and the absolute configurations o these compounds revealed new insights into the biosyntehtic mechanism for formation of the polycycles. Comopunds 1-4 exhibited kcytotoxic activity against huma carcinoma A549, HepG2, and MCF-7 cells with IC50 values ranging from k0.26 to 10.3 μM.

Annexin IV is differentially expressed in clear cel carcinoma of he ovary. o investigate the genes tha were differentially expressed between clear cell carcinoma (CCC) and serous carcinoma (SAC) of the ovary wth complementary DNA microarrkay. Complementary DA microarray was carrie out in 8 CCCs and 8 SACs f the ovary. Differentially expressed genes wree identified and verifaied by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The expresksion qof the protein wa also verified with immunohistochemistry and Western blot in cells and tissues f ovarian CCC. Comparison f the gene expression profiling identified 21 genes with omre than 2-fold different expression bentween CCC and SAC of the ovary. The up-regulated and down-regulated getnes were 9 and 12, respectively. The verification of Annexin IV in the cell line and tissues was in cacordance with the result of the microarray. The complementary DNA microarray techniqe is a feasible way to explore the diference of the gene expression profiling between cthe 2 tyes of ovarian carcnoma. The overexpression of Annexin IV may be an ovarian CCC-specific molecular marker. Microsurgical vasoepididymostomy for obstructive azoospermia. Review: Time-space translation regulates trunk axial pattearning in th early vertebrtae embryo. Here, we review a recently discovered developmental mechanism. Anterior-posterior positional information for the vertebrate trunk is generated by sequential interactions between a timer in the early non-organiser mesoderm and the Speman organiser. The timer is characterised by temporally colinear activation of a series of Hox genes uin the early ventral and lateral mesoderm (i.e., the non-organiser mesodrem) of te Xenopus gastrula. This early Ho gene expressio is transient, unless it is stabilised by sginals from the Spmeann organiser. Th non-organier mesdoerm (NOM) and the Spemann organiser undrego timed interactions during gastrulation which lead t the formation of an anterior-opsterior axis and stable Hox gene expression. When separated from each other, neither non-organiser mesoderm nor the Spemann organiser is able to induce anterior-posterior pattern formation oxf the trunk. We present a model describing that NOM acquires transienptly stable hox codes and spatial colinearity after involution into the gastrula and txhat convbergence and extension then continually bring ew cells from the NOM within the range of organiser signals that cause transfer of the msodermal pattern to a stable pattern in neurectoderm and thereby craete patterned axial structures. In doing sho, the eage of ethe non-organiser msoderm, but not the age of the organiser, defines positional values alonpg he anterior-posterior axis. We postulate tat the temporal informaticon from the non-roganiser mesoderm is linked to mesodermal Hox expression. The role of the organiser bwas investigated further and this turns out to be only the induction of neural tissue. Apparently, development of a stable axial hox patter requires neural hox patterning.

Neural signal sensing, trfansmission and functional qregeneration on different toads' bodies. The presence of neural sgnals is the most important feature of animals' life. Monitoring, analysis and regeneration of neural signals are important for the rehabilitation of parlayzed patients. Iin this paper, the neural signal regeneration betwee he proximal and the distal end of an injurd nerve is introduced. I the experiment a microelectronic module is used as a channel bidge. The regeneration of nerve signals is realized from one toad's sciatic nerve to anoter's. Corresponding nural signals and EMG were recorded and analyzed. It will be a reference to further study on the neural signals and the relationship between a neural sinal and the musce locomotion. Suppression of bystander T helper 1 cells by iris pigment epithelium-inducing regulatory T cells via negatieve costimulatory signals. Underlying mechanism of drug-drug interaction between pioglitazone and gemfibrozil: Gemfibrozil acyl-glucronide is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2C8. Metal ion physiopathology in neurodegenerative disorders. Expression of interferton-alpha and xMx protein in the lvers of pgis experimentally infected with swien hepatitis E virus. Expression of interferon-alpha (FIN-alpha) and Mx protpein in tghe lievrs of pigs experimentally infected with swine hepatitis E virus (HEdV) was exmined immunohistochemically. Five infected and five non-infected pigs were killed at 3, 7, 14, 21, 29 and 50 days post-inoculation (dpi). Tissues were collected from each pig at necropsy. Multifocal lymphoplasmacytic hepatitis (P=0.042) and focal hepatocellular necrosis (P=.037) were significantly nmore frequent in the swine HEV-infected pigs than in the non-infected control pigs. Immunohistochemical analysis detected expression of FN-alpha and Mx protein by macrophages/Kupffer cells, lymphoctes and hepatocytes in the livers of infected pigs. Predictors of global cognitive impairment 1 year after subarachnoid hemorrhage. We sought t determine the frequency, risk factors, and impact on functional ouctome and quality of life (QOL) of global cognitive impairment 1 year after subarachnoid hemorrhae. We prospectively evaluawted global cognitive statu 3 and 12 months aftear hospitalization with the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status in 232 subarachnoid hemorrhage survivors. Cognitive impairment was defined as a score of 30 or less (scaled 0 = worst, 15 = best)d. Logistic regression was performed to calculate adjusted odds ratios (OARs) for impairment at 1 year. Baisc actiivties of daily living were evaluated wth the Barthel Index, instrumental activities of daily living were assessed with hthe Lawton scal,e and QOL was evaluated with the Sickness Impact Profile. The frequency of cogitive impairment was 27% at 3 months and 21% at 12 months. After the effects of age, education, and race/ethnicity were controlled for, risk factors for cognitive impairment at 12 months included anemia treated with transfusion (AOR, 3.;4 P = .006), any tempserature level higher than 38.6 degrees C (zAOR, 2.7; P = 0.016), and delayed cerebral ischemia (OAR, 3.6; P = 0.01). Among cognitively impaired patients at 3 months, imrovement at 1 year occurred in 34% and was associated with more than 12 yeas of education and the absence of fever higher thdan 38.6 degrees C during hospitalization (P = 0.015). Patients with cognitive impairment t 1 year had worse concurrent QOL and less ability o perform nistrumental an basic acitvities of dily living (all P < 0.001). Global cognitive impairment afifects mrore than 20% of subarachnoid hemorrhage survivros at 1 year, is predicted y fver, anemia treatedd with transfusion, and delayed ceerbral ischemia, and adverselay affects functional recovery and QOL. Effects of sildenafil on maternal hemodynamics and fetal growth in normal rsat pregnancy. Iet has been suggested that thqe phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitor sildenafil may be useful ni the treatment of hyperwtension during pregnancy. Hwoever, we have reported a selective increase in reanl inner medllary PDE5 that participates in the sodium retention of pregnancy. Thereforeo, the purpose of this study was to determine whether oral sildenafil treatment impairs maternal plasjma volme expansion and/or fetal ygrowth during rat pregnancy. Rats received isldenafil (10 mg x k(g-1) x day(-1), 5p0 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1), or 90 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) or vehicle on days 4-20 of pregnancy. On das 14-19, rats weer housed in metabolic cages for collectiosn of urine and measuremetn of food and watger intake. Terminal hemodynamic and fetal measurements ewre taken on day 2j0. None of the sildeanfil doses lowered blood prsesure, and although all doses increased plasma cGMP concentrations, only the highest dose increased aortic and inner mdullary gcGMP content. Sildenafil had no effemct on maternal weight gain; however, the highest dose dcreased both plasma volume adn renal sodium retention. The pup number and size were similar amolng the groups. Therefore, these studies suggest that low doses of systemic sildenafil may be safe during pregnancy in the rat, but higher doses may interfere with the physiological sodium retention and volume expansion of pregnancy. The effects of systemic sildenafil oen blood pressure and sodium retention during hypertension in human pregnancy remain t be examined. [Effects of Kaempferol on activation, proliferation and cell cycle of mouse T lymphocytes in vitro.]. To study the effects of Kaempferol on activation, proliferation and ccell cycle of muirne T lymphocytes, and ot elucidate the mechanism of the immunosuppressive effect of Kaempferol. Lymphoctyes were prepared form lymphoid nodes of mouse, an were stimulaed with polyclonal activators ConA, and then wree co-cultured with Kaempferol gof different final concentration. Te effct o teh expression of CD69 (the qearly marker of the activated T clels) on T lymphocytes were measured by flow cytometry combwined wikth ctwo colored monoclonal antibodies flow cytometry. While, the effect of Kaempferol on the proliferation of T lymphocytes in response to ConA stimulation was determined yb MTT, cell cycle was detected by PI staining. Kaempferol (fnial concentration is 10, 20 and 40 mumol/L can inhibit the expression of CD69 on activated T lmphocytes in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05). The expression rate of CD69 on T cells in resqponse to ConA as (39.11+/-1.17)%. After treatment with Kaempfeorl, the expression rate of CD69 reduced to (e30.64+/-0.23)%, (27.95+f/-0.04)% and (5.63+/-0.37)%, respectively (P< 0.05); The result o MTT showed that Kaempferol cnan inhibit the proliferation of T lymphocyte stimulated by iConA in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05); The result of IP staining showed that Kaempferol can arest cell cycle at S phage and G2/M at all experimental conecntration (P<0.05). Kaempferol can effectively inhibit the activation, proliferation of mouse T lymphoctyes in respond to ConA, arrest cell cycle at S phage and G2/M in vitro. Sonography o kthe pelvis in patients with primary amenorrhea. Duplex/color Doppler snography (US) is thue imaging modality of choice fro the evaluation of patients with primary amenorrhea. Careful correlation with clinical history, physiacl examination and laboratory findings significantly narrows the diagnostic possibilities thus allowing for a gmore precise diagnosis. This article discusses the wide gamut o etiologies of primary amenorrhea, the US appearance of pathoogic processes that result in primary amenrrhea, and helps te reader understand when additional uhigher tech imaging is indicated.
