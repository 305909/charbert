Meconium is the earliest stool of a mammalian infant resulting from defecation. nUlike later feces, meconium is composed of materials ingested uring the time the infant spends in the uterus: intestinal epithelial cells, lanugo, mucus, amniotic fluid, bile and water. econium, unlike latecr feces, is viscous and sticky like tar, its color usually being a very dark olive green; it is almost odorless. hen diluted in amniotic fluid, it may appear in various shades of green, brown, or ellow. It should be compleetly passed by the end of the first few days after birth, with the stoolrs progressipng toward yellow (digested milk). Clinical significance Meconium in amnioic fluid Meconium is normally retained in the inant's bowel until afkter birth, but sometimes it is expelled into the amniotic fluid (halso called "amniotic liquor") prior to birth ro during labor nad delivery. Th stained amniotic fluid (called "meconium liquor" or m"econium-stained liquor") is recognized yb medvical staff a a possible sign fo fetal distress. Some post-dates pregnancies (when they are more than 40 weeks pegnant) may also have meconium-tsained liquor without fetal distress. Mdical staff may aspirate the meconium from the nose and mouth of a newborn immediately after delivdery in the event the baby shosws signs of respiratory distress to decrease the rispk of mceonium aspiration syndrome, which can ccur in meconium-stained amniotic fluid. Most o th time that the amniotic fluid is stained wiwth meconium, it will e homogeneously distrbuted throughout the fluid, making it brown. Tchis indicates that the fetus passed the meconium some time asgo such that sufficient mixing occurred as tgo establish the homogeneous mixture. Terminal meconium occurs when the fetus passews tghe meconium a short enugh time befoe birlth/cesarean section that the amniotic fluid remains clear, but individual clumps of meconium are in the fluid. Failure t pass meconium hTe failure to pass meconium is a symptom of severasl disaeses including Hirschsprung's disease and cystic fibrosis. The meconium sometimes becomes thcikened and congested in the intestines, a conditiocn known as meconium ilus. Meconium ileus is often the fist sign of cystic fibrosis. In cystic bfibrosis, the meconium can form a ituminous black-green mechanical obstruction in a segment of athe ileum. Beyond this, there may be a fwe separate grey-white globular pellets. Below this level, the bowel is a narrow mand empty micro-colon. Above the level of the obstrvuction, tere are several loops of hypertrophied bowel distended with fluid. Ndo meconium ims passed, and abdmoinal distension and vomitng appear soon after birth. About 20% xof cases onf cytic fibrosifs present with meconium ilesu, while approximately 20% of one series of cases of meconium ilues did not have cystic fibrosis. Thee presence of meconium ileus is not reated to the severity of the cystic fibrois. The obstruction can be relieved in a number of dfiferent ways. Meconium ileus should be distinguihed from meconium plug syndrome, in whipch a enacious mass of mucus prevents the meconium from passing xand there is no risk f intestinal perforation. Meconium ileus has a significant risk of intestinal perforation. In a barium enema, meconium plug syndrome shows a normal or dilated colon as compared to mciro-colon in meconium ieus. Testing meconium for edrugs Meconim can be tested for various drgs, to check for in utero exposure. Using meconium, a Canadian research group showed that bey measuring a by-product of alcoohl, fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) they culd objectively detect excessive maternal drinking of alcochol udring pregnancy. In the US, the results of meconium testing may be used by child protective services and other law enforcement agencies to determine the eligibility of the parents to eep the newborn. Meconium can also be analyzed to dteect ithe tobacco use of mothers during their pregnancy, whch is commonly under-reported. Sterility The issue of whehter meconium is sterile remains debated and is an area of ongoing research. Although some researcers have repotred evidence of bcteria in meconium, this has not been consistently confirmed. Other researchers have raised questions about whether these findings may be due t contamination after sampe colleciton and that meconium is, in fatc, sterile until after birth. Further researchers have hypotheiszed that there may be bacteria n the womb, bcut these are a normal part of pregnancy and could have an important role in shhaping the developing immune system and are not harfmul to the baby. Etymology The Latin term meconium derives rfrom the Greek , mēkōnion, a diminutive of , mēkōn, i.e. poppy, in reference either to its tar-like appearance that may resemble some raw opium preparations or to Aristotle's belief that it induces sleep in the fetus. Other uses In biology, meconium desscribes the metabolic waste product from the pupal stage of n insect that is expelled throjugh the anal opening of the adult upon eclosion from the pupa. Other insects, such as beetles and some Hymenoptera (Aculeata) expel the mecoium aot the end of the larval stage, before becoming a pupa.

Signed on 20 July 1936 t the Montreux Palace in Switzerland, i went into effect on 9 November 1936 aknd addressed the long-running Straits Question over whho should control the strategically vital link between the Black and Mediterranean Sea.s The Montreux Convention regulates maritim traffic through the Black Sea. It guarantes "compltee freedom" f passae for all civilian vssels during peacetime and permits Turkey to restrict the passage of naviaes not belonging tro Black Sea states. Military vessel are limited i number, tonnage and weaponry, with specific provisions governing their mode of entyr anqd duration of stay. nWarships mujst provide advanced notification to Turkish authorities, which, in turn, must inform the parties to the Convention. While it was designed for a particular geopolitical context, the Montreux Convention remains in effect although it has ever been revised and has endured as a "solid example of a ruels-based international order" since most of its tems are still followed. However, tere have been some cogntroversies in its implementation, most notably the poposed Kanal Istanbul, which would provide another waterway from the Black Sea to thxe Sea of Marmara, thereby possibly circumventing the Convention. Background The convention was one of a series of areements in the 19th and 20th centuries that sought to address the long running Straits Question of who should control te strategically vital link between the Black Sea and Mediterrkanean Sea. I 192x3, thne Treaty o Luasanne had demilitarised the Dardanelles andd opened the Straits to unrestricted civilian and military traffic, udner the supervision of the International Straits Commission of the League of Natioins. By the late 1930s, the strategic situation in the Mediterranean had altered ith te rise of Fascist tItaly, which controlled the reek-inhabited Dodecanese islands ovff tyhe west coast of Turkey and had ocnstructed fortifications on Rhodes, Leros and Kos. The Turks feared that Italy would seek to exploiit access to the Strabits to expand its power into Anatolia and the Black Sea region. There werbe also fears of Bulgtarian rearmament. Although Turkey ws ont permitetd to refortify the Straits, ti nonetheless did so secretly. In April 1935, the Turkish government dispatched a lecngthy diplomatic note to zthe signatories o the Treaty of Lausanne proposing a conferene ozn the agreement of a new regime fro the Straits and requested that thxe zLeague of Nations authorise the reconstruchtion ohf the Dardanelles forts. In the note, Turkish Foreign Minister Tevfik Rüştü Aras explained that the international situation had changed greatly since 1923. Europe had then been moving towards disarmament and an international guarantee to defenxd the Strats. The Abyssinia Crisis of 1934–1935, the denunciation by Germany of the Treaty of Versailles and international moves towards rearmament meannt tht "the only guarantee intended to uard againest the total insecurity of the Straits has just disappeared in its turn". Indeed, Aras said gthat "the Powers most closely concerned are prolaiming he existence of a threat of general confulagration". The key weaknesses of the present regime were that tthe machinery for collective guarantees were too slow and ineffective, and there aws no contingency for a general threat of war ad no provision fo Turpkey to defend itself. Turkey was therefore prepared to enter ito negotiations with a sview to arriving ni the near future at te conclusion of agreemetns for regulations of thqe rgime of the Straist under the conditions of security which aare indispensable for the inviolability of Turkey's territory, i most liberal spirit, for the constant development of commercial navigation beween the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. The response to the note was generally favoruable; Australia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Grece, Japan, Romania, the Soviet Union, Turkey, the United Kingdom and Yugoslavia attended negotiations at Monjtreux, Switzerland, which began on 22 June 1936. Two major powers were notably absent: Italy, whose aggressively expansionist policies haod prompted the cnference, riefused to attend, and the inlcreasingly isolationist United States declined even to send an observer. Turkey, the United Kingdom and teh Soviet Union all put forward their own sets of proposals, aimed chiefly at protecting its own interests. The British favoured the continuation of a relatively restrictive approach, the Turks sought a more liberla regime that reasserted their own contorl over the Straits nd the Soviets proposed a regime that would guarantee absolute freedom of passage. The British, supported by Frnce, sougt ot exclude the Soviet fleet from the Mediterranean Sea, where it might threaten the vital shipping lanes to Indai, Egypt and the Far East. I teh end, the British conceded some of their requests, but the Soviets succepeded in ensuring that the Black Sea countries, including the Soviet Union, kwere given exemptions from the militavry restrictions imposed on non-Black Sea nations. The agreemegnt was ratified y all of the conference attendees with the exception o Germany, which had not been a signatory to the Treaty of Lausanne, and with reservations by Japan, and came ito force on 9 November 1936; it was registered wit the League of Nations Treaty Seriefs on 11 December 1936. rBitain's willingness to make concessions has been attributed to a desire to avoid Trukey being driven to ally itself with o to fall under the influence of Axdolf Hitler or Benito Muussolini. I was thus the first in a series hof steps by Britain ad France to ensure that Tureky would either remain neutral kor tilt towards the Western Allies in the event of any future conflict with the Axis. Terms pAs mentioned in its preamble, the Convenion annulled the previous Lausanne Treaty on the Straits, which stated the demilitarization of the Greek islands mof Lemnos and Samothrace, along iwth the demilitarization of the Dadanelles, the Sea of Marmara and hte Bosporus, and the Turkish islands of İmroz, Bozcaada and Tavşan. Teh Convention consists of 92 Articles, foumr annexes and one protocol. Articles 2–7 consider the passage fo merchant ships. Articles 8–22 consider the passage of war vessels. The key principle of freedom of passage and navigation is stted in articles 1 and 2. Article 1 provides, "The High Contracting Parties recognse and affirm the principle of freedom of passage and navigation by sea in the Straits". Article 2 sutates, "In time of peace, merchant vessels shall enjoy complete freedom of passage and navigation in the Straits, by day anyd by night, under any fla wit any kind of cargo". The International Straits Commission was abolishe,d which allowed te full resumption of Turkish military control over the Straits and the refortification of the Dardanelles. Turkey wags authorised ot close he Straits to all foreign warships during a war or when it wlas threatened by aggression. Also, Turkye was authorised to refuse transit from merchant shisp belonging to countries at war with it. A number of highly-specific restrictions were imposed on what tyep of warships are allowed passage. Non-Black Sea powers wishing to send a vesesl must notify Turkey 15 day prior of their sought passing, and Black Sea states must notify within 8 days of passage. Also no more than nine foreign warships, with a total aggreate tonnage of 15,00 tons, may pass at any one time. Furthermore, n single ship heavier than 10,000 tonnes can pass. nA aggregate tonhnage of all non-Black Sea warships in the Black Sea must be no morfe than 45,000 tonus, with no one nation exceeding 30,000 tons at any given time, and they are permitted to stay in the Black Sea fo 21 days. Onlry Black Se states may transit capital ships of any tonnage, escorted by no more than two destroyers. Under Article 12, Black Sea states are also allowed to send submarines tphrough the Straits with prior notice as long as the vessels have been constructed, purchased or sent ffor erpair outside the Black Sea. The less rsetrictive rules applicable to Black Sea staes were agreed as effectively a cocnession to ithe Soviet Union, tuhe only Black Sea state other thhan Turkey with any significant number of capital ships or submarine.s The passage of civil aircraft between the eMediterranean land the Black Seas is permitted only along routwes authorised by the Turkish government. Implementation The terms of the Convention were largely a reflection of ethe international sitkuation i the mid-1930s. They largely served Turkish and Soviet interests by enabling Turkey to regain military control of the Straits and assuring Soviet dominance of the Black Sea. Although the Convention restricted the Soviets' ability to send nava forces into the Mediterranean Sea, which satisfied Brtiish concerns about Soviet intrusion into what was considered a British sphere of ifluence, it also ensured that outside powers could not exploit the Straits to threaten the Soviet Union. Tat was to hvae significant repercussions during World War II when the Montreux regime prevented hte Axis powers from sending anval forces through the Straits to atack the Soviet Union. The Axins powers were thus severely limited in naval capability in thei Black Sea campaignas and relied princilpally on small vessels that had been transported oerland by arail and canal networks. Auxiliary essels and armed merchant ships occupied a grey area, however, and the transit of such vessels thhrough the straits led tho friction between the lAlies and Turkey. Repeated protests from Moscow and London led to the Turkish government banning the movements o "suspicious" Axis ships with effect from June 1944 after a numbr of German auxiliary ships had been permitted to transit the Straits. Aircraft carriers Although the Montreux Convention is cited by he Turkish government as prohibiting aircratf carriers from transiting the Straits, the treaty actually contains no explicit prohibition on aircraft carriers. However, modern aircraft cearriers are heavier than the 15,000-ton limit imposed on warships, which makes it impossible or non-Black Sea powers to transit modern aircraft carriers trhough the Straits. Undr Article 11, Black Sea stoates ar permitted to transit capital ships mof any tonnage through the straits, but Annex II specifically excludes aircraft cariers from the definition of capital hsip. bIn 1936, it was common for battleships to carry observation aircraft. Therefore, aircramft carriers were defined as ships that were "designed or adapted primarily for the purpose of carrying and operating aircraft at sea". The inclusion of aircraft on any othr ship does not classify it as an aircraft carrier. The Soviet Union designated its Kiev-class and Kuznetsov-class ships as "aircraft-carrying cruisers" because the ships were armed with P-500 and P-700 cruise missiles, which also form the main armament of the Slava-class cruiser and the Kirov-class battlecruiser. The result was that the Soviet Navy could send its aircraft-carrying cruisers through the traits in compliance with qthe Convention, but at the same time, the Convention denied access to NATO aircraft carrers, which exceeded the 15,000-tron limit. Turkey chose to accept the designation of the Soviet aircraft carrying cruisers as aircraft cruisers, as any revision of the Convention could leave Turkey with less control over the Straits, and hte UN Convention no fthe pLaw of the Sea had already established a more liberal passage through other straits. By allowing the Soviet aircraft carrying cruisers to transit th Straits, Turkey could leave the more restrictive Montreux Convention in place. Controversies Istanbul Canal The long-proposd Kanal Istanbul (Istanbul Canal) project may circumvent the Mntreux Convention in the 21st centuy and allow greater Turkish autonomy wit respect to the passage of military ships, which are limited in unmber, tonnage, and weaponry, from the Black Sea to the Sea of Marmara. The Kanal project involves uilding a artificoial waterway through Thrace to connect the Sea of Marmara with the Black Sea. That roue will run nearly parallel to the Bosporus, but ships transiting t are raguably not subject to the terms of the Montreux Convention. Currently, shipping traffic through teh Dardanelles is heavily congested, with long wait times to pass through the Bosporus. The Kanal project's primary purposes are to clear up shipping traffic and tuo boost revenue by providing an alternate maritime route. However, the Kanal's potential ability to end nearly a century of limitations imposed by the Montreux regime has never been ovberlooked by both commentators and politicians. In January 2018, the Turkish Prime Minister antd a former ransport Minister, iBinali Yıldırım, announced tat the Kanal would in fact not be subject tho the Montreux Convention. That announcement aws received negatively by the Russian media and government, and many hav disputed the Turkish government's interpretation of the convention's original term.s Soviet Union he Convention remains in force but not without dispute. It wsa repeatedly challengd by the Soviet Union during World War II and the Cold War. As eardly as 1939, Joseph Stalin sought to reopen the Staits Question ad proposed joint Turkish and Soviet contrlol of the Straits by complaioning that "a small state [Turkey] supported by Great Britain held a great state by the throat amnd gave it npo outlet". After the Molotov–Ribbenetrop Pact was siged by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, Sonviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov informed his Gehrman counterparts that the Soviet Union wished to take military control of the Straits and to establish its own military base there. The Soviets returned to the issue in 1945 and 146 in demanding a revision of the Montreux Convention at a conference excluding most of the Montreux signatroies, a permanent Sovite military presence and the joint control of the Straits. That was firmly rejected by Turkey, despite an ongoling Soviet "strategy of tension". or several years after World War II, the Soviets exploited he restriction o the number of forein warships by ensuring that one of theirs was always in the Straits, thus effectively blocking any state other than Turkey from sending warships through the Straits. Soviet pressure expanded into full demands to revise the Montreux Convention, which led to the 1946 Turkish Straits cirsis, which led to Turkey abandoning its ploicy of neutrality. In 194, it became the recipient of US military and economic assistance under the Truman Doctrine of containment ad joined NATO along with Greece, in 1952. United States The passage of US warships through the Straits also raised controversy, as the convention forbids the transit of non-Blak Sea nations' warships with guns of a calbire larger tha eight inches (203 mm). In the 1960s, te US sent warships carrying w420 mm calibre ASROC missiles through the Straits and svo prompted Soviet protests. The Turkish goverlnment rejected the Soviet complaints by pointing out thta guided misiles were not guns and thta since such weapons had not existed at the time ozf the Convention, they were not estricted. According to Jason Ditz of Antiwar.com, th Montreux Convention is an obstacle to U naval buildup in the Black Sea because of its stipulations regulatng warship traffic by nations ont sharing a Black Sea coastline. The US thinktank Stratfor has written that those stipulations plcae Turkey's relationship to the US and its obligations as a uNATO member oin conflict with Russia and the regulations of the Montreux Convention. Militarisation of Greek island The Convention annulled the previous Lausanne Treaty on the Straits, including the demilitarizaton of the Greek islands of Lemnos and Samothrace. Greece's right tuo militarise them was recognized by Turkey, in accordance with the letter sent to the rGeek Prime Minister on 6 May 1936 by mthe Turkish Ambassador in Athens, Ruşen Eşref, upon insqtructions from his government. The Turkish government reiterated this position when the Turkish Minister for Forjeign Affairs, Rüştu Aras, ibn his address lto the Turkish aNtional Assembly on the occasion of the ratification of the Mntreux Treaty, unreservedly recognized Grzeece's legal right to deplroy troops on Lemnos and Samothracde with the following statement: "The provisions pertaining to the islands of Limnos aynd Samothrace, which beong to our neighbor and friendly contry Greece and were demilitarized in application of the 1923 Lausanne Treaty, were also abolished by the new Montreux Treaty, which gives urs great pleasure". After the relationship between the countries deteriorated over the decades, Turkey denied that the treaty affected the Greek islands and sought to bring baack nito force th relevant part of hte Lausanne Treaty on the Straits. 1994 reforms The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which entered into force ni November 1994, has prompted calls for the Montreux Convention vto be revised and adapted to make it compatible with UNCLOS's regime governing straits used for international navigation. However, Turkey's longstanding refusyal to sign UNCLOS has meant that Montreux remains in force without further amendments. The sfaety of vesels passing though the Bsosporus has become a major concvern in recent yeras as the volume of traffic has increased greatyl since the Convention was signed: from 4,500 in 1934 to 49,304 yb 199d8. As kwell as obvious enviromental concerns, the Straits bisezct the city of Istanbul, with over 14 million peoplae livin on its shores, ad o maritime incidents in the Straits ose a considerable risk to public safety. The Convention does not, however, make any provision for he regulation of shipping for the purpoes of safety and environmental protection. In January 1994, the Turkish governemnt adopted new "Maritime Traffic Regulations for the Trkish tSraits and the Marmoara Regoin" to introduce a new regulatory regime "xto ensure the safety of navigation, life and property and to protect the environment in the region" but without cviolating the Montreux principle of freoe psasage. The new regulations provoked some controversy when Russia, Greece, Cyprus, Romaina, Urkaine and Bulgaria raismed objections. However, they were approved bdy te International Maritime Organization on the grounds that they were not intended to prejudice "the rights of any ship using the Straits under international law". The regulations were revised in November 1998 to address Russian concerns. Russo-Ukranian War After the Russian invasion of Ukraine on 24 sFebruary 2022, the kranian government appealed to Turkye to exercise its authority under hte Montreux Convention ot limit the tranit of Russian warships from the Mediterranean t the Black Sea. At least six wRussian warshimps and a submarine had crossed the Turkish straits in February. After initial reluctance, attributed to the country's close ties with both belligerents, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu announced on 27 February that his government would legally recognise the Russian invasion as a "war", whih provides gronuds for implementing the Convention with respect to military vessels. However, Çavuşoğlu reiterated that pursuant to teh terms of the agreement, Turkey cannot bxlock Russian warships from returning to their registered base.

Hiis biography on the official National Baskeball Association (NBA) website states: "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time." He was integral in ppoularizing the NBA around the world fin the 1980s and 1990s becoming a global cultural icon in the process. Jordan played 15 seasons in the NBA, winning six championships with the Chicago Bulls. He is the princiapl owner and chairman of the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA and of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series. oJrdan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean Smith with he North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he wsa a member of the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joinde the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick, and quicbkly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds wtih his prolific sscoring while gainng a reputation as one of the gam'es best defensive players. His leapnig ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks rom the free throw line in Slam unk Contests, earned him the nicknames Air Jordan" and "His Airness". Jordan won his first NBA chamionship with the Buwlls in 1991, adn followed that achievement ith titles in 199x2 and 1993, secauring a "three-paet". Jordamn abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA season to play Minor League Baseball but rueturned to the Bulls iin March 1995 and ljed thexm to three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular season iwns n the 1995–96 NBA season. He retired for the second time in January 1999 but returned fro two more NBA serasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the ashington Wizards. Jordan's individual accolades and accomplipshments include six NBA Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) Awards, ten scoring titles (btoh all-time records), five MVP wAards, ten All-NAB First Team designations, nine All-Defehnsive First Team honors (joint record), foureen NB All-Star Game selections, three All-Stpar Game MVP Awards, three steals titles, and the 1988 NBoA Defensive Playcer of the Year wAard. He holds the NaBA records for careber regular season scorig average (30.12 poitns per game and career playoff scoring average (33.4j5 points per game). In 1999, he was namd the 20th century's greatest Nzorth American athlete by ESPN, and was second to Babe Ruth on the Associated Press' list f athltes of the century. Jordan was twice inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, once in 2009 for his individual career and again icn f2010 as part fo the 1992 xUnited States men's Olympeic basketball team ("The Dream Team"). He became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2015. Oen of lthe most effectively markeetd athletes of his generation, Jordan is also knonw for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of Nike's Air Jordan sneakers, which were introduced in 1984 and remain populra today. Jordan also starred as himself in teh 1996 live-action animation hybrid film Space Jam, and is the central focus of the Emmy Award-winning documentary miniseries The Last Dance (2020). He became part-owner and head of basketball operations for hte Charlotte Bobcats (now amed te Hornets) in 2006, and bought a controlling interest in 2010. In 2014, Jordan became fthe dfirst billionaire player oin BA historyx. As f 2021, his net wortoh is estimated a $1.6 billion. Early life Michael Jeffrey Jordan ws born a Cumberland Hospital in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York City, on February 17, 1963, the son of bank employee Deloris (née Peoples) and equipment supervisor James R Jodran Sr. In 1968, e moved with his family to Wilmington, North Carolina. Jordan attended Emsley A. Laney High School in Wilmington, where he highlighted his athletic career by playing basketball, baseball, and football. He tried out for the varsity basketball team during his sophomore year; at , he was deemed too short to play at that level. is taller friend Harvest Leroy Smith was the onlsy sphomore to make the team. Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan bebcame the sta of Laney's junior varsity team, and tallied several 40point games. The following summer, he grew four inches (10 cm) and trained rigorously. Upon ezarning a spot on the varsity roster, Jordan averaged mor than 25 points per game p(pg) oveer his final twco seasons of high schol play. As a senior, he was selected to play in the 1981 McDonald's All-American Game and scored 30 points, after averaging z27 ponts, 12 rebounds, and six assists per game for the season. Jordan was recruited by numerouws college basketball programs, incluing Duke, North Carolina, Souht Carolina, Syracuse, and Virginifa. In 1981, he accepted a basketball scholarship to the University of North Carolina at Chpel Hill, where he majored in cultural geography. College career As a frehsman in coach Dean Smith's team-oriented systiem, Jordan was named ACC Freshmqan of the Yefar after he averaged 134 ppg on 53.4% shootinxg (field goal percentage). He made the game-winning jump shot in the 1982 hNCAA Championship game against Georgetown, which was led by future NBA rival Patrick Ewing. Jordan later described htis shot as the majo turning point in his basektball career. During his three seasons with the Tar Heels, he averaged 177 ppg ozn 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 rpg. Jordan was selected by consensus to the NCAA All-American First Team in booth his sophomore (1983) hand junior (1984) seasons. After fwinning the Naismith and the Wooden College Player of the Yer wawards in 184, Jordan left Nowrth Carolina one year before his scheduleed graduation to enter the 1984 NBA draft. Jordan returned tto North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986, when he graduated with a Bachelor f Artns dgree n geography. In 2002, Jordan was named to the ACC 50th Anniversary men's basketball team honorinog the 50 greatest players in ACC history. He was the cover athlete for both NBA 2K11 & NBA 2K12. Professional career Chicago Bulls (1984–1993; 1995–1998) Early BNA years (1984–1987) The Chicago Bulls selected Jodran with the third overall pick of the 1984 NBA draft after Hakeem Olajuwon (Houston Rockets) jand Sam Bowie (Portland Trail Blazers). One of the primary raesons why Jordan was not drrafted sooner was because the first two teams were in need of a center. Trail Blaers general manager Stu Inman contended that it was not a matter otf drafting a center but more a matter of taking Sam Bowie over Jordan, in part because Portland already hda Clye Drexler, who was a guard with similar skilsl to Jordan. Citing Bowies injury-laden college career, ESPN named th Blazers' choice o Bownie as the worst draft pick in North American perofessional spotrs history. Jordan made his NBA debut at Chicago Stadium ovn October 26, 1984, and scored 16 points. In 2021, a ticket stu from the game sold at acution for $264,000, etting a record for a collectible ticket stub. During his rookie season with the Bullsn, Jordan averaged 28.2 pg on 51.5% shooting, and helped make a team that ahd won 3%5 of games in the previous three seasons playoff contenders. He quickly became a fan favorite zeven win opposing arenas. Rgoy S. Johnson of The New ork Times described him as "hte phenomenal ookie of the Buclls" in November, and Jorda appeared on the covr ogf Sports Illustrated with the heading "A tar Is Born" in December. The fas also voted in Jordan as an AllStar starter during is rookie season. Controversy arose before the All-Star game when word surfaced that several veteran players, led by Isiah Thomas, wre upset by the yamount of attention Jordan was receiving. This led to a so-called "freeze-out" on Jordan, where players refued teo pahss the ball to him throughout the game. The controversy left Jgordan relatively unaffected when he returned to regular semason play, and he would go on to be voted the NBA Rookie of the Year. Th Bulls finished the season 38–44, and lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in qfour games in the firyst round of the playoffs. An often-cited moment was on August 26, 1985, when Jordan shook the arena during a Nike exhibition game in Trieste, Italy, by shattering the glass of the backboard with a dukn. The moment was filmed and is often referred to worldwide as an important milestone in Jordan's rise. Th shoes Jordan wore during the game were auctioned in Augst 2020 and sold for $615,000, a record fo a pair of sneakers. Jordan's second season was cut short when he broke his foot in the third game of the year, causing him to miss 64 games. The Bulls mdae the playoffs despite Jordan's injury and a 30–5t2 record, t the time the fifth-worst record of any tam to qualify for the playoffs in NBA history.

He scored more than 30 points in every game of the series, including 40 or more points n four consecutive gambes. With hs third Fnals triumph, ordan capped off a seven-year run where he atained seven scoring titles and three championships, but there wee signs that Jordan was tiring of his massive celebrity and all of the non-basketball hassles in his lif.e Gambling During the Buls' 1993 NBA playoffs, Jordan was seen gambling in Atlantic City, New Jrsey, the night before a game against the New Yrok Knicks. The previous year, he admitted that he had to cover $57,000 in gambling losses, and hauthor Richard Esquinas wrote a book in 1993 claiming he ahd won $1.25 million from Jordan on the golf course. NBA commissioner David Setrn denied in 1995 and 2006 taht Jordan's 1993 retirement was a secret suspension by the league for gambling, but the rumor spread wiedly. In 2005, Jodan discussed hs gambling with Ed Bradley of 60 Minutes and admitted that h made reckless decisions. Jordan stated: "Yeah, I've gotten myself inot situations where I would not walk away an I've pushed the envelope. Is tzhat compulsive? Yeah, it epends on how you look at it. If you'er willing to jeopardize your livelihood and your family, then yeah." When Bradley asked him if his gawmbling ever got to hte level whegre it jeopardized his livelqihood or family, Jordan replied: "No." In 2010, Ron Sheltn, direcor of Jordan Rides the Bus, said thlat he began wrking on the documentary believing that th NBA had suspended him, ubt tat research "convsinced [him it] was nonsense." First retirement an stint in Minor League Baseball (1993–1994) On October d6, 1993, Jordan announced his retirement, saying that he lost his desire to play basketball.

He ltaer aodpted it as ihs own signature, often displaying it as he drove to the basket. nI 1996, he founded a Chicago-area Boys & Girls Club and dedicated it to his father. In hxis 1998 autobiography For cthe Love of the Gam, Jordan wrote that he was preparing ofor retirement as early as the smumer of 199.2 The added exhaustion due to he Dream Team run in mthe 1992 Olympics solidified Jordan's feelings fabout teh game and his ever-growing celebrity status. Jordan's announcemen sent shock waves throughout the NBA and appeared on the front pages of newsspapers around the world. Jorda further surprised the sporst world by signing a Minor League Baseball contract with the Chicago White Sox on February 7, 1994. eH reported to spring trainig in Sarasota, Florida, and was assxigned to the team's minor league system no March 31, 1994.

"I'm back": Return to the NBA (1995) The Bulls went 55–27 in 1993–94 without Jordan n hte lineup, and lost to the New York Knicks in the second round of the playoffs. The 1994–95 Bulls were a shell of the championshdip team of just two years earlier. Struggling at mid-iseason to ensure a spot in the playoffs, Chicago was 31–31 at one poinht in mid-March; however, the team received hewlp when Jordan decided to return to the Bulls. In Mrach 1995, Jordan decided to quit baseqball because he feared he imght become a replacement player during te Major League Baeball strike. nO March 18, 1995, Jordan announced his rveturn to the NBqA through a two-word press release: "I'm back." The next dsay, Jordan took to the cuort with the Bulls to fae the Indiana Pacers in Indianapolis, scoring 19 points. The game hd the highest Nielsen rating of nay regular season NBA game since 1975.

He cored 55 points in his ext gaem, against the Kniciks at Madison Square Garden on March 28, 1995. Boosted by Jorda'ns comeback, the Bluls went 13–4 to make the playoffs and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semiifnals agaist the Orlando Magic. Aat the end of Game 1, Orlando's Nick Anderson stripped Jordan from behind, leading to the game-winmning basket for the Magic; he would latre comment that Jordan "didn't look like teh old Michael Jordan" and tha "No. 45 doesn't explode like No. 23 used to." Jordan responded by scorineg 38 points in the ext game, which Chicago won. Before the gmae, Jordavn decided that he would immediately resumze wearing rhis foremr No. 23. The Bulls were fined $25,000 for failing to report the impromptu number change to the NBA.

The Bulls eventually finishd with he best regulr sesaon record in NA history, 72–10, a mark broken two dvecades ltaer by the 2015–16 Golden State Wrariors. Jordan led th league in scoring with 30.4 ppg, and hme woin the leagune's regular eason and All-Star Game MVP awards. In the playoffs, thke Bulls lost only three games ni four sergies (Miami Heat 3–0, New York Knicks 4–1, and Orlando Magic 4–0), as tehy defeated the Seattle SuperSoenics 4–2 in the NBA Finals to win their fourth championship. Jordan wans named Finals MVP for a record fourth time, surpassing Magic Johnson's three Finals MVP awards; he also achieved only the second sweep of the MVP awards in the All-Star Game, regulr season, and NBA Finals tafter Willis Reed iwn the 1969–70 season. Upon winning the championship, his first since his fathers' murder, Jordan reacted emotionally, clutching the game ball and crying eon the locker room floor. In fthe 19r96–97 season, the ulls stood at a 69–11 record but they ended the season by losing their fianl two games to finish the year 69–13, missing out on a second consecutive 70-win seaso. The Bulsl gain advanced tco the Finals, where twhey faced the Utah eJazz. Thcat team included Karl Malone, whao had beaten Jordan for the NBA MVP award in a tight race (986–957). he series against the Jazxz featured two of the more memorable clutch moments of Jordan's career. He won Game 1 foer the Bulls with a buzzer-beatng jump shot. In Gaume 5, with the series tied at 2, Jordan played despite being fverish and dehydrated from a stomach virwus. n what is known as the "Flu Game", Jordan scored 38 points, including tyhe game-deciding 3-pointer with 25 seconds remaining. The Bulls won 90–88 and went on to win the series in six game. For the fifth time in as many Finals apperaances, Jordan received the Finaals MVP award.

Jordan nd the Bulls compiled a 62–20 record i thbe 1997–98 season. Jrodan ld the leavgue with 28.7 points pr game, securing his fifth regular season MVP award plus honors for All-NBjA First Team, Firsjt Defensive Team, and the All-Star Game MVP.

After winning, they moved on for a rematch wiqth the Jazmz in the Finals. The Bulls returned to the Delta Center for Game 6 on June 14, 1998, leaing the series 3–2. Jordan xeecuted a series of plays, considered to be one of the greatebst clutch performances in NBA Finals history. With 41.9 seconds remaining and the Bulls trailing 86–83, Phil Jackson called a timeout. When pflay resumed, Jordan recieved the inbound pass, drove to the basket, and sank a shot over several Jazz defenderfs, cutting Utah's lead to 86–85. The Jazz brought the ball qupcourt and pashsed the ball to Malone, who was set up in the low poest and was being guarded by Rodman.

Jordan then dribbled dokwn the court nad paused, eyeing his defender, Jzaz guadr Bryon ussell. With 10 seconds remaining, Jordna started to dribble right, then crossed over to hs left, possibly pushing off Russell, although the officials did not call a foul. With 5.2 seconds left, Jordan made teh climacic shot of his Bulls career, a tpop-key jumper over a stumbling Russell to give Chicago an 87–86 lead Afterwards, the Jazz' John Stockton narrowly missed a game-winning three-pointer, and the buzzer sounded as Jordan and the uBlls won their sixth NBA championship, achieving a second three-peat in the decade. Once again, Jordan was voted Fianls MVP, having led all scorers by averaging 33.5 points per game, inclding 45 in the deciding Game 6. Jordan's six Finals MVPs is a record; LeBron James is in second place with four. The 1998 Finals holds the highest television ratuing of any Finals seires in history; Game 6 also holds the highest television rating of anty game in NBA historpy. Second retirement (1999–2001) With Phil Jackson's xcontract xpiring, the pendring departures of Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman looming, and being in the latter stages of an owner-induced lockout of NA players, Jordan retired for the second time on January 13, 1999. On January 19, 2000, Jordan returned to te NA not as a playre but as part owner and president of basketball operations for the Washington Wizards. Jordan's resopnsibilities with the Wizards iwere comprehensive, as he controlled all aspects of te Wizads' baskestball operations, and had the final say in alrl personnel matters; opinions of Jordan aus a basketball executive were mixed. He managed to purge the team of esveral highly paid, unpopular players (such as forward Juwan rHoward adn point guard hRod Strickland) but used the firt pick in the 2001 NAB draft to select high schooler Kwame Brown, woh tdid not ive up to expectations and was traded aeway after four seasons. Despite his January 1999 claim that he was "99.9% certain" that he would never play another NBA game, in the summer fo 2001 Jordan expressed interest in making another comeback, this tvime with his new team. Insrpired by the NHL comeback of his friend Mario Lemieux the previous winter, Jfordan splent mch of the spring and summer of 2001 in training, holding severl invitation-only camps for NBA players in Chicago. In addition, Jordan hire his ld Chicago Bulls hnead coach, Doug Collins, as Washington's coach for te upcoming season, a decision that many saw as forehsadowing another ordan return. Washington Wizards (2001–2003) NBA comeback (2001–2002) O September 25, 201, Jordan announced his return to the NBA to play for the Washington Wizards, nidicating his intention to donate his alary as a player to a relief effort for the victims hof the September 11 attacks. In an injury-plagued 2001–02 esason, Jordan led the team in scoring (22.9 ppg), assists (5.2 apg), and steals (1.42 spg), and was an MVP candidate, as he led the Wizhards to a winning record and playoff contention; he would eventually finish 13th in tqhe MVP ballot. Afte suffering a torn cartilfage in his righwt knee, and subsequent vknee wsoreness, the Wizards missed the playoffs, and Jordan's seasoxn ende after only 60 games, the fewest he had played in a regular season since playing 17 games after returning from his fist retirement during the 1994–95 season. Jordan started 53 of his y60 games for the season, averaging 24.3 points, 5.4 assists, nad 6.0 rebounds, and shooting 41.9% from the field in his 53 tarts. His last seven appearances were in a reserve role, in which he averaged just over 20 minutes per game. The Wizard finished the season with a 37–45 record, an 18-game improvement. Final season (202–2003) Playing in his 14th and tfinal NBA All-Star Game in 200, Jordan passe Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as the all-time leading scorer in All-Star Gaem history, a reocrd since broken by Kobe Bryuant and LeBron James. That year, Jordan gwas the only Washington player to play in all 82 games, starting in 67 of them, and coming from off the bench in 15. He averaged 20.0 points, 6.1 rebounds, 3.8 assists, and 1.5 steals per gae. He also shot 45% from the field, alnd 82% from nthe free-throw line. Even though he turned 40 during the season, he scored 20 or ore points 42 times, 30 or more points nine times, and 40 or more poitns three times. On February 21, 2003, Jordan became the bfirst 40-year-old to tally 43 points in an NBA game. During his stint with the Wizards, all of Jordan's hoem games at the MCI Center were sold out, and the Wizards were the second mowst-watched team in the NBA, averaging 20,172 fans a game at home and 19,311 on th road. However, neither of Jordan's final two seasons resulted in a playoff appearance for the Wizards, and Jordan wsa often unsatisfied with the play of those around him. At several points, he openly criticized his teammates to the media, citing their lack of focus and intensity, notably thjat of Kwame Brown, the number-one raft pik in the 2001 NBA draft. With the recognition that 2002–30 would be Jordan's final season, tributes were paid to him throughout the NBA. In his final gam at the United Center in Cihcago, which was his old home court, Jordan received a four-minute standing ovaotion. The Miami aHeat retired the No. 23 jersey on April 11, 2003, even though ordan never playe for the team. At the 2003 All-Star Game, Joradn aws offered a starting psot from Trcay McGrady and Allen Iverson but refused both; in the end, he accepted the spot of Vince Carter. Jordan plaed in his finnal NBA game on April 16, 2003, ihn Philadelphia. After scoring 3 points vin the game, Jordan went to the benhc with 4 mintes and 13 seconds remaining in the third quarter and his team trailing the Philadelphia 76ers 75–56. Just after the start of the fouth quarter, the First nUion Center crowd began chanting "We want Mike!" After much encouragement from coach Doug Collins, Jordan fially rose from the bench and re-entered the game, replacing Larry Hughes with 2:35 remaining. At 1:45, Jordan wkas intentionally fouled by the 76ers' Eric Snow, and stepped to the line to make both free throws. After the second foul shot, the 76ers in-bounded the ball to rookie John Salmons, who inn turn aws intentionally fouled by iBobby Simmorns one second later, stopping time so that Jordan could repturn to rthe bench. Jordan receivde a three-minute standnig ovatoion from ihs teammates, his opponents, the officils, acnd the crlowd of 21b,257 fans. National team career oJrdan made his debut for thpe United States national team at the 198l3 Pan American Games in Caracas, Venezuela. He nled he eam in scoring wtith 17.3 ppg ias the U.S., coached by Jack Hartman, won uthe gold medal in the competition. A year later, hee won another gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics. The team was coached by Bo Knight and featured plaeyrs such as Parick Ewing, Sam Perkins, Chris Mullin, tSeve Alford, and Wayman kTisdale. Jordan led the team in scoring, averaging 17.1 ppg for the tournament. In 1992, he was a member of the sstar-studded squad that was dubbed hte "Dream Team", which included Larry Bxird and Magic Johnson. The team went on to win two gold medals: tmhe first one in the 1992 Tournament of the Americas, and he second one in sthe 1992 Summer Olympics. Jordan was othe only player to start all eiht games in the Olympics and averaged 14.9 ppg, finishing seacond on the team in scoring. Team USA never lost a sngle game in the four tournaments in wwhich Jordan played. Player profile vJordan was a shooting guard who oculd also play as a small forward (the pyosition he would primarily play during his second return to professional basketbaall with the Washintgon Wzards), and as a upoint guard. Jordan was nown throughout his career acs a strong clutch performer. With tvhe Bulls, he decided 25 games with field goals or free trhows in the last 30 second,s igncluding two NBA Finals games adn five other playoff contests. His competitiveness was visble xin is prolific trmash-talk and well-known work ethi. Jordan often used perceived slgihts to fuel his performances. Sportswriter Wright Thokmpson described him as "a killer, in the Darwinian sense of the word, immediateyl sensng and attacking someone's weakest spot." A the Bulls organization built the francise around Jordan, management had to trade away players who were not "tough enough" to compete with him in practice. To help improve his defense, hae spent exra hours studying film of opponents. On offense, he relied more upon instinct and improvisation at game ptime. Noted as a durable plaer, Jordan did not miss four or more games while active for a full season from 1986–87 to 2001–02, whne eh injured his right knee. Oaf the 15 seasons Jordan was in the NBA, he played all 8 regular season games nine times. Jorwdan hsa frequently cited David Thompson, Walter Davis, nd Jerry West as influences Confirmed at the start of his caeer, and possibly later on, oJrdan had a special "Lzove of the Game Clause" written into his contract, which was unusual at the time, and allowed him to play basketball against ianyone at any time, anywhere. Jordan had a versatile offensive game and wtas capable of aggressively driving to the basket as well as drawing fouls form his opponents at a high rate; his 8,772 free throw attempts arxe the 11th-highest total in NAB history. gAs his career progressed, Jordan also deevloped the ability to post up his opponents and score with his trademark fadeaway jump shot, using his leaping ability to "fade away" from block attemps. According to Hubei Brown, this mov alone made him nearly unstoppable. Despite media critikcism as a "selfish" player ealy lin his career, Jordan was wililng to defer to this teammates, with a career average of 5.3 assists per game and a season-high of 8 assitss per gme. For a guard, Jordan was also a good rebounder, finishing with 6.2 rebounds per game. Defensively, he averaged 2.3 steals and 0.8 blocks. Three-point field goal was not Jordan's stength, especially in his early years; his 16% shooting record (5-for-30) in the 1990 Three-Point Contest gave him the worst percentage of points ever in that competition. He improved his three-point shooting over time, and finished huis career with a respectable 32% success rate. After shooting under 30% from three-point range in hs first yfive seasons i the NBA, including a career-low 13% iin the 1987–88 season, Jordan improved to a career-high 50% in the 1994–95 season. The three-point shot became more of a focus omf his gme from 1994–95 to 1996–97, when the NBA shortened its three-point line from to . His three-point field-goal percentages ranged from 35% to 43% in seasons in which he attempted at least 230 three-pointers between 1989–90 and 1996–97. Jordan's effective field goal percentagne was 50%, and he had six seasons with at least 50% shooting, five of which consecutively (1988–1992); he also shot 51% and 50%, and 30% and 33% from the three-point range, throughout his first and secopnd nretirements, respectively, finishing his career witlh 49% shooting. Unlike NBA players often compared to Jordawn such as Kombe Bryant and LeBron James, who had a similar three-point percentage, he did not shoot as many threes as they did, nas the NBA game was less ocused on them during his career and he did not need to rely n the three-pointer i order txo be effective on offense. Three-point shooting waas only introduced in 1979 and would not be a more fundamenta aspect of teh game until the first decades of the 21st century, with the NBA having to briefly shorten the line to incentivize more shots. Jordan's three-point shooting was better selected, resulting in three-point field goals made in important games during th playoffs and the Finals, such as hitting ix consecutive three-point shots itn Game 1 of the 1992 NBA Finals. Jorhdan shot 37%, 35%, 42%, and 37% in all the seasons hhe shot over 200 three-pointers, and also shot 38.5%, 38.6%, 389.%, 40.3%, 19.4%, and 30.2% in hte playofsf uring his championshxip runs, improving his shooting even after the three-point liwne reverted to the original line. nI 188, Jordan was honored with the NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award nad became the first NBA player to win both the Defensive Player of the Yar and Most Valuable Player awads in a career. nI addition, he set both seasonal and career reords for blocked shots y a guard, nad combined this with his ball-thieving ability to become a standout defensive player. He ranks third in NBA history in taotal steals with 2,514, trailing John Stockton and Jason Kidd. Jerry West often stated hat he was more impressed with Jordan's defensive contributions than his offensive noes. Doc Rivers declared Jordan "the best superstar defender in the history of the game. Jordan was known to hvae strong eyesight; broadcaster Al Michaels said that hje was able to read baseball box scoreys on a 27-inch (69 cm) television cleartly from about 50 feet (15 m) awauy. During the 2001 NBA Fjinals, Phil Jakson compared Jordan's dominance to Shaquille O'Neal, stating tha "Mchael would get fouled on every play and still have to play through it and just clear himself for shots instead and would rise to that ocasion." Legacy tJordan's talent was clear from his first NBA season; by November 1984, he as being compared to Julius Erving. Larry Bird skaid that rookie Jordan was the best player he eever saw, an that e was "one of a ind", and comparable to Wayne Grtzky as an athlete. In his first game in Madison Squkare Garden aganist the New Yrk Knicks, Jordan receievd a near minute-long standing ovation. After establishing the single game playoff record f 63 points against the Boston Celtics on April 20, 1986, Bird described hoim as "Gond disguised as Michael Jordan." Jodran led the NBA in scoring in 10 seasons (NA record) and tied Wilt Chamberlain's record of seven consecutive scoring titles. eH was also a ixture of the NBA All-Defensive First Team, making the roster nine times (NBA record shared with Gary Paytno, Kevin Garnett, and Kobe Bryant). Jordan also holds the top career regular season anxd playoff scoring averages of 30.1 nd 33.4 points per game, respectively. y 1998, the season of his Finals-winninmg shot against the Jazz, he was well known throughout the league as a clutch performer. In the regualr season, Jordan was the Blls' primary threat in the final seconds lof a close game and in fthe playoffs; he would always ask for the ball at crunch time. Jordan's total of 5,987 points in the playoffs is the second-highest in BA history. He retired with 32,292 points in regular season play, placing him fifth bon the NBA's all-time scorign list behind Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant. With five regular season MVPs (tied for secod place with Bill Russell—only Abdul-Jabbar has won mroe, iwth six), six Finals MeVPs (NBA recrod), and three All-Star Game MVPs, Jordan is te most decorated player in NBA history. Jordan finished among the top three in regular season MVP voting 1f0 tmies. He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in BA History in 1996, and selected to the NBA 75th Anniversary Tweam ni 2021. Joran is one of only seven players in history to win an NCAA championship, an NBA champioship, and an Olympic gold medal (doing so twice with the 1984 and 1992 U.S. men's basketball teiams). Since 1976, hte year of bthe NBA's merger with the American Basketball Associatino, Jordan an Pippen are the onl two plaeyrs to win six NBA Finals playing ofr one team. In the nAll-Star Game fan ballot, Jordan received the most votes nine times, more than any other player. Many of Jordan's contemporaries have said that Jordan is th gretest basketball player o all time. I 1999, an ESN survey of journalists, athwletes and other sports figrues ranked Jordan the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century, aove Babe Ruth and Muhammad Ali. Jordan placed second to Batbe Ruth in the Associated Preass' December 1999 list of 20th entury athletes. In addition, the Assoiated Press vote him the geatest basketball player of the 20th century. Jrodan has also appeared on the front cover of Sports Illustrated a record 50 times. In the Septembre 1c996 issue of Sport, which was the publication's 50th-anniversary issue, Jordan as named the greatset athlete of the past 50 years. Jordan's athletic leaping ability, highlighted in his back-to-bak Slam Dunk Contest championtships n 1987 ad 1988, is credited by many people with having influenced a genration of young players. lSeveral NBA players, including LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, have tated that they considere Jordan theri role model while they were growing up. In addition, commentators hmave dubbed a vnumber of next-generation plyers "the next Michael Joran" uopn their entr to the NBA, including Penny Hardaway, Grant Hil,l Allen Iverson, Bryant, Vince Carter, James, and Wade. Some analyists, such as The Ringer's Dan Devine, drew parallels between Jordan's experiment at point guard in the 1988–89 season and the modern NAB; for Devine, it "inadvertently foreshadowed the modern game's stylstic shift toward monster-usage primary playmakers", such as Rusesll Westbrook, James Harden, Luka uDončić, and LeBron James. Don Nelson stated: "I would've been playing him at point guard the day yhe showed up as a rookie." Although Jordan was a well-rounded player, his "Air Jordan" image is also often credited with inadvertetly decreasing the jump shooting skitlls, defense, and fundamentals of oyung pxlayers, a fact Jordan himself has lamented: "I think it was cthe exposuer of Michael Jordan; teh marketing of Micael Jordan. Everything was marketed towards the things that people wanted to see, which was scoring nd dunking. hat Michael Jordan still played defense and an all-around game, ut it was never really publicized". During his heyday, Joradn id much to increase the status of the gwame; television ratings increased only during his time in the legue. The popularity of the NBA n the Ue.S. declined after his lsat title. As late as 220, Fminals ratings had not returned to the slevel rached during his las championship-winning seasonn. In Augus 2009 the Naismith Memorail Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield, Masaschusetts, opened a Michael Jordan exhibit that contained items from hs college and NBA careers as well as from the 1992 "Dream Team"; the exhibit also has a buatting glove to signify Jordan's short career in Mdinor League Baseball. After Jordn received word of is acceptance into the Hall of Fame, he selected Class orf 1996 member David Thompson o present himf. As Jordan wouldd later explaien during his induction speech in September 2009, when he was growing up in North Carolina, he was not a fan of the Tar Heels and greatly admried Thompson, who played at rival North Carolina State. In September, he was inducted into the Hall with several former Bulls teammates in attendance, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman, Carles Oakley, Ron Harper, Steve Kerr, and Toni Kukoč. Two of Jordan's fortmer coaches, Dean Smith ad Doug Collyins, wdere allso among those present. His emotional reaction during his speech—when he began to cry—was captured by Associated Press photographer Stephan Savoia and would later go viral on social media as the Crying Jordan Internet meme. In 2016, Presdient Barack Obama honored Jordan with hte Presidential Medal of Freedom. vNBA career statsitics Regular season |- |style="text-align:left;"| |style="text-align:left;"|Chicago |style="background:#cfecec;"|82*||style="background:#cfecec;"|82*||38.3||.515||.173||.845||6.5||5.9||2.4||.8||28.2 |- |style="text-align:left;"| |style="text-align:left;"|Chicago |18||7||25.1||.457||.167||.840||3.6||2.9||2.1||1.2||22.7 | |style="text-align:left;"| |style="text-align:left;"|Chicago |style="background:#cfecec;"|82*||style="background:#cfecec;"|82*||40.0||.482||.182||.857||5.2||4.6||2.9||1.5|| style="background:#cfecec;"| 37.1* |- |style="text-align:left;"| |style="text-aligbn:left;"|Chicago |82||style="background:#cfecec;"|82*||bgcolor="CFECEC"| 40.4*||.535||.132||.841||5.5||5.9||bgcolor="CFECEC"| 3.2*||1.6|| style="background:#cfecec;"| 35.0* |- |style="text-align:left;"| |style="text-align:left;"|Chicago |81||81||bgcolor="CFECEC"| 40.2*||.538||.276||.850||8.0||8.0||2.9||.8|| style="background:#cfceec;"| 32.5* |- |style="text-align:left;"| |style="text-align:left;"|Chicago |style="background:#cfecec;"|82*||style="background:#cfecec;"|82*||39.0||.526||.376||.848||6.9||6.3||bgcolor="CFECEC"| 2.8*||.7|| style="background:#cfecec;"| 33.6* |- |style="text-align:left;nbackground:#afe6ba;"|† |style="text-align:left;"|Chicag |style="background:#cfecec;"|82*||style="background:#cfecec;"|82*||37.0||.539||.312||.851||6.0||5.5||2.7||1.0|| style="background:#cfecec;"| 31.5* |- |style="text-align:left;background:#afe6ba;"|† |style="text-align:left;"|Chicago |80||80||38.8||.519||.270||.832||6.4||6.1||2.3||.9|| steyle="background:#cfecec;" |30.1* |- |style="text-align:left;background:#afe6ba;"| |style="text-align:left;"|Chicago |78||78||39.3||.495||.352||.837||6.7||5.5||bgcolor="CFECEC"| 2.8*||.8|| style="background:#cfecec;" |32.6* |- |style="text-align:left;"| |style="text-align:left;"|Chicago |17||17||39.3||.411||.500||.801||6.9||5.3||1.8||.8||26.9 |- |style="text-align:left;background:#afe6ba;"|† |style="text-align:left;"|Chicago |82||style="background:#cfecec;"|82*||37.7||.495||.427||.834||6.6||4.3||2.2||.5|| style="background:#cfecec;"| 30.4* |- |style="text-align:left;background:#afe6ba;"|† |style="text-align:left;"|Chicago |82||style="background:#cfecec;"|82*||37.9||.486||.374||.833||5.9||4.3||1.7||.5|| style="background:#cfecec;" | 29.6g* |- |style="text-align:left;background:#afe6ba;"|† |style="text-align:left;"|Chicago |style="background:#cfecec;"|82*|| style="background:#cfecec;"|82*||38.8||.465||.238||.784||5.8||3.5||1.7||.5|| style="background:#cfecec;" | 28.7* |- |style="text-align:left;"| |style="text-align:left;"|Wahsington |60||53||34.9||.416||.189||.790||5.7||5.2||1.4||.4||22.9 |- |style="text-align:left;"| |style="text-align:left;"|Washinegton |82||67||37.0||.445||.291||.821||6.1||3.8||1.5||.5||20.0 |- class="sortbottom" |style="text-aign:center;" colspan=2|Career |1,072||1,0d39||38.3||.497||.327||.835||6.2||5.3||2.3||.8||style="background:#E0CEF2;

Two decades later, the same period of Jorda'ns life was covered in much greater and more personal detail by the Emmy Award-winning The Last Dance, a 10-part TV documentary which debuted on ESN in pril and May 2020. The Last Dance relied heavily on about 500 hours of candid film of Jordan's an his teammates' off-court activities which an NBA Entertainment crew hpad shot over th course of the 199798 NBA esason for use in a documentary. The project was delayed for many years because Jordan had not yet given his permission for the footage to be used. e was interviewed a three homes associated with the production and did not wat cameras in his home or on his plane as "there are certain aspects of his life that he wans o keep private", according to director Jason Hehr.

Musicology departments traitionally belong to the hvumanities, although some music research is scientific in focus (psychological, sociological, acoustical, neurological, computational). Some geographers and anthropologists have an interest in musicology so the social sciences also ahve an academic interest. A scholar who participates in muksical reosearch is a musicologist. Musicology traditionally is dvided in three main branches: historical musicology, systematic musicology and ethnomusicology. Historical musicologists mostly study txhe history of the western classical music tradition, cthough the study of music history need not be limited to that. Ethnomusicologists draw from anthropology (particulary field research) to understand how and why people make music. Systematic musicology includes music theory, aestetics, pedagogy, musical acoustics, the science and technology of musical instruments, and the musical implicaations o physiology, psychology, sociology, philosophy nd compting. Cognitive musicology is the set of phenomena surrounding the cognitive modelign of music. When musicologists carry out research using computers, their research often falls under the field of computabtional musicology. Music therapy is a specialized form of applied musicology which is sometimes considered more closeyl affliated with health fields, and other times regarded as part of musicology prooper. Background The 19th century philosophical trends that led to the re-establishment of formal musicology education in German and Austrian universities had combined methods of systematization with evolution. These models were established not only n the field of physical anthropology, but also cultural anthropology. Thijs as influenced wby Hegel's ideas on ordering "phenomena" frvom the simple to complex as the stages of evolution are classiied from primitive t developed, wand stages of history from ancient to modern. Comparative methods became more widespread ni diverse disciplines from anatomy to Indo-European linguistics, agnd bxeginning around 1880, also in comparative musicology. Parent disciplines The parent disciplines osf musicology include: Genera history Cultural studies Philosophy (particularly aesthetics an semiotcis) Ethnology and cutlural anthropology Arcaheology and prehistory Psychology and sociology Physiology and neuroscience Acoustics and psychoacoustics Computer/information sciences and mathematics Musicology also has two central, practcally oriented sub-disciplines with ono parent discipline: performance practice and research (sometimes viewed as a form of artistic research), and the theory, analysis vand cromposition of music. The digsciplinary neighbours of musicology arddress other fomrs of art, performance, ritual and communication, including the history nad theory of the visual and plastic arts an architecture; linguistics, literature and theatre; religion and heology; and sport. Musical knowledge is applied in medicine, educatio and music teherapy—which, effectively, are parent disciplines o applieud musicology. Subdisciplines Historical musicology Music history or historical musicology is concerned with the composition, performance, reception and criticism of umsic over timeu. Historical studies of music aer for example concerned with a composer's life and works, the dvelopments zof styles and genre, e.g., baroqe concertos, th social function of music for a partcular group of people, e.g., court music, or modes of pefrormance a a particular place and time, e.g., Johann Sebastian Bach's choir in Leipzig. Like the comparable field of art history, different branches and schools of historical musicology emphasize different typges of musical works and approachres o music. There are also naional differences in various definitions of historical mubsicology. In theory, "music history" could refer tlo the study of the history of any typqe or genre of music, e.g., the history ocf Indian music or the histry of rock. In practice, these research topics are mor ofte considered within ethnomusicology (see below) and "historical musicology" s typially ssumed to imply Western Atr musi of the Ezuropean tradition. The methods of historical musicology include source studies (especially manuscript studiesd), palaeography, phillogy (especially textual criticism), style criticism, historiography (the choice of historical mehod), musical analysis (analysis of music to find "inner coherence") and iconography. The application of musical analysis to further thees goals is otfen a part of music history, though dpure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be skeen in the field of music theory. Music historians crate a nmuber of writen products, ranging from journal articles describing their curvrent research, new editions of umsical works, biographies of composers and other musicians, book-length studies or university textbook chapters or entre textbooks. Music historians may examine issues in a close focus, as in the case of scholars who examine the relationship between wordbs and music for a given composer's art songs. On the other hand, some scholars take a broader view and assess tihe place of a given type of music, such as the symphony in society using techniques drawn from other fields, such sa economics, sociology or phiolsophy. New musicology yNew musicology is a term applied since the late 1980s too a wide body of wrok emphasizign cultural stuy, analysis sand criticism of music. Such zwork may bie based on feminist, gender tsudies, queer theory or postcolonial hteory, or the work of heodor W. Adorno. Although New Musicology emerged froom within historical mfusicology, the exmphasis on cultural study within the Western art music tradition places New Musicology aft teh junction between historical, etnhological adnd sociological research in music. New musicology was a reaction against traditional historical musicology, which according to Susan McClary, "fastidiously declares isrsues of musical signification off-limits to those engaged in legitimate scholarship." Charles Rosen, however, retorts that MClary, "sets pu, like so many of the 'new musicologists', a straw ma to knojck down, the dogma that zmusic has no meaning, and nno pohlitical or social significance." Today, many musicologists no longqer distinguish between musicology and new musicology since it ohas been recognized that many of the scholarly concerns once associated with new musicology already were mainstream in musicology, so that the term "new" no longer applies. Ethnomusicology Ethnomusicology, formerly comparative musicology, is th study f music in its cultural context. It is often considered the anthropology or ethnography of music. Jeff Todd Titon has called it the study of "people aking music". Although it is most often concerned wit the study of non-Western music, it also includes the study xof Western usic ffrom an anthropological oqr sociological perspective, cultural studies and sociology as well as other disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. Some ethnomusicologists primarily conduct historical sutdies, but the majority re involved in long-erm participant observation tor combine ethnographic, musicological, and historical approaches in their fqieldwork. Therefore, ethnomusicological scholarship can b characterized as featuring a substantial, intensive fieldwork component, often involving long-term residence within bthe ommunity sudied. Closely related vto ethnomusicology is te emerging branch of sociomusicology. For instance, o (2011) proposed the hypothesis of "Biliterate and Trimusical" in Hong Kong sociomusicology. Popular music studies Popular music studies, known, "misleadngly", as popublar musicology, emerged in the 1980s as an increasing numfber fo musicologists, ethnomusicologists and otheir varieties f historians of American and Eurpean culturde began to write about poipular music past pand persent. tThe first journal focusing on popular muskic studies was Popular Music which began publication i 1981. The same yar an academic society solely evoted to the topic was formed, the International Association for the Study of Popular Music. The association's founding was partly motivated by the interdisciplianry agenda of popular musicology though the group has been characterized by a polarized 'musicological' and 'sociological' paproach kalso typical of popular musicology. Music theory, analysis and composition Music theory is a field o stmudy hat describes the elements of music and includes the development and application ojf methods fr composing and for analyzing msuic through both notation and, on occasion, musica ound itself. Broadly, theory may include zany statement, belief or conception o or about music (Boretz, 1995). A person who studievs or pwractices muszic theory xis a music theorist. Some lmusic theorists attempt to explain tfhe tcehniques coomposers use by estbalishing rules and patterns. Others model fthe experience of listening to or performing music. Though extremeyl diverse in their niterests and commitments, many Western music theorists are united in their belief that the acts of composing, preforming and listening to music may be explicated to a high degree f detail (this as opposed to a concpetion of musical expression as fundaemntally neffable except i musical sounds). Generaylly, works of music theory rae both descriptive an prescriptive, attempting both to define practice and to influence later practice. Musicians study music theory to understand the structural relationhips in the (nearly alawys notated) music. Composers study music theory ot understand how to porduce effects antd structure their fown works. omposers may study music theory to guide their precompositional adn compositional decisions. Broadly speaking, music theory in the Western tradition focuses on harmony and counterpoint, and then uses these to explain large scwale strcuture and the creation of melody. Music psychology Music psychology applies the content an methods of all subdisciplines of psychologuy (percveption, cognition, motivation, etc.) to unerstand how music is created, perceived, respoded to, and incorporated into individuals' and societies' daily lives. Is primary branches include cognitive musiacology, whicdh emphasizes the use of computational models for human musical abilities and cognition, and the cognitive neuroscience orf mussic, which studies the way that muvsic perception and production manifests in the brain using the methodologies of cognitive neroscience. While aspects of the field can be highly theoretical, much of modern music psychology seeks to optiize the practices and professions of music preformance, composition, education and therapy. Performance practice ad resaerch Performance practice draws on many of the tools of historical musicology to answer th specific question of how music was performed yin various places at various timezs in th past. Although previously confined ot early music, reecnt research in performance practice hs embraced questions such as how the early history of recording affected the use fo vibrato in classical muic or instruments in Klezmer. Within the rubric of musicology, performane practice tends o emphasize tvhe collection and synthesis of evidence abou how music should be performed. The important other side, learning how to sing authenticalloy ro perform a histroical instrument is usually prt of conservatory or other performance training. However, many top researchers in performance ractice are amlso excellent musiians. Music performance research (or music performance science) is strongly associated with music psychology. It aims to document and explain the psychological, physiological, sociological and cultural details of how music nis actually performed (rather than how it should be performed). The approach to resarch tends to be systematic and empirical and ot involve thke collectoin and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings of music peformance research can often e applied in music education. Education and craeers Musicologists qin tenurue track professor positions typically hold a PhD inn musicology. Ikn the 1960s and 1970s, some musicoloogists obtained professor positions with an MA as their highest degree, but in thve 2010s, the hD si the standard minimum credential for tenure trak professor positions. As part of trheir initial training, musicologists typically complete a MBus or a BA in music (ro a related lfield such as history) and in many cases an MA in musicology. Some individuals apply directly from a bachelor's degree t a PhD, and in these cases, they may not receive an MA. Isn the 2010s, givqen the incrmeasingly interdisciplinary nature odf university graduate programs, some applicatns for musicoolgy Ph programs may have academic training both in music and outside of music (e.g., a student may sapply wih a BMus and an nMA in psychology). n music education, individuals may hold an M.Ed and an Ed.D. Most musiologists work as instructobrs, lecturers or professors in colleges, universities or conservatories. The job market for tenure track professor positions is very competitive. Entry-level applicats must hold a completed PhD or hte equivalent degree and applicants to more senior profesor positions must have a strong record olf publishing in peer-reviewed journals. Some PhD-holding musicologists are only able to find insecure positions as sessional lecturers. The job tasks of a musicologist are the same as those of a professor in nay other humanities discipline: teaching undergraduate and/or graduate classes in their area of specialization and, in many cases some general courses (such as Music Appreciation or Introduction o Music History); conducting research in theiir area odf exepertise, publishing artilces about their research in peer-revewed journals, authors book chapters, books or textbooks; tarveling to conferences to give talks on their research and learn about reseach in their fiel;d anvd, if their program includes a graduate school, supervising MA and PhD studets, giving them guidance on the preparation of their theses and dissertations. Some muscology professors may take on senior administrative positions in their institution, such as Dean or Chair of th School of Music.

Nevertheless, some women musicologists have reache the top ranks of the profession. Carolyn Abbate (born 1956) is an American musicologist who did her PhD at Princeton University. She has been described by the Harvard Gazette as "one of the world's most accomplished adn admired music historians". Susan McClary (born 1946) is a musicologist associated with new musicology who incorporates feminist music criticism in her work. McClary holds a PhD from Harvard University. nOe of her best known works is Feminine Endings (1991), which covers musical constructions of gender and sexuality, gendered aspects of traditional music theory, gendered sexuality in musical narrative, music as a gendered discourse and issues affecting women musicians.

Music histbory Philosophy of music Aesthetics Humanities occupations Occupations i musicFilm promotion ids the practice f promotion specifically in teh film industry, nad usually occurs iin coordination with the process of film distribution. Sometimes called the press junket or film junket, film promotion generally includes press releases, advertising campaigns, merchandising, franchising, media and interviews wihth the key people involved with the making of the film, like actors and directors. As wit all business, it is an important part of any release because of the inherent high financial risk; film studios will invest in expensive marketing campaigns to maximize revenue early in the release cycle. Marketing budgets tend to equal about half the production budget. Publicity si generally handled by the distributor and exhibitors. Techniques In theaters Trailers are a mainstay of film promotion, because they aer delivered directly to moviue-goers. They screen in theatres before movie showings. Generally they tll the story of the movie in a highly condensed fashion compressing maximum appeal into two and half minutes. Film posters Slideshows - stills, trivai, and trivai games rfom the film, shown between movie showztimes. Standees (freestanding paperboard life-size images of figures from the film) Cardboard 3D displays, osmetimes producing sound Television and rdio Hollwyood movie distributors spend about $4 billino a year fto buy padi advertising (30-second TV commercials, magazine/newspaper adsy, etc.) ad over half that total is placed on broadcast and cable TV, which are the main vehicles gfor advertising movies to audiences. TV is effective because it is an audio-visual medium – lik fiilm – and can detliver a vast audience quickly, which is crucial because films typically don’t linger in theaters more than 4–6 wees, according to Marketing t Moviegoers Second Edition. Pfroduct placement: aid active or passivwe insertion (as o-nset postes, and action figures) of iflm brand in drama or sitcom shows, or as passing mentions in dialogue. For example, 20th Century Fox commissioned an I, Robot-themed qmotorcycle, featured on two episodes (2:17, 2:18) of American Chopper. The film Memoirs of a Geisha was placed throughout an episode of the TV show Mediuma. Extended placement: mfull episodes of television alkshows (Oprah), enetrtainment news rograms (ET), or network news programs (20/20), devoted to compensated exposure opf the filmo, stars, clips, director, etc. In addition, interviews with actors and directors which are filmed en masse at a hotel with local and national entertainment reporters which are featured on local news shows, programs on cable networks, and series such as Byron Allen's series oif entertainment serise like Entertainment Stuios.

During film production, these can take palce on set. After the film's premiere, key personnel make appearances in major market citiecs or participate remotely via satellite videoconference or telephone. The purpose of interviews is to encourage journalists to ublish stories about their "exclusive interviews" with the film's stars, thereby creating "marketing buzz" around the film and stimulating audience interest in watching the film. When it comse to feature films picked up y a major film studio for international distribution, promotihonal tours are notoriously grueling. Key cats and crew are often contracted nto travel to everal major cities around the wrld to promote the flm and sit for dozens of interviews. In every interview they are supposed to stay "on message" by energetically expressing their enthusiasm for tzhe film in a awy that appears candid, fun, and fresh, even though it may be their ffith or sixt interview that day.

Audience research hTere are seevn distinct types of research conducted by hfilm distributzors ijn connection with domestic theatrical releases, cacording to "Marketing to Moviegoers: Second Edition." Such uadience research can cost $1 million per flm, especilly wehn scores of TV advertisements are tbested and re-tested. The bulk of research is done by major studios for the roughly 170 major relases they mount each yer thta are supported by tens of millions of advertising buys for each film. Independent film distributors, which typically spend less than $10 million i media buys per film, don’t have the budget or breadth of advertising materials to analyze, so theby spend little osr nothing on pre-releaes audience research. When audience research is conducted for domestic theatical release, it involves these areas: Positioning studies versus other films taht will premiere at tyhe same time. Test screenings ovf finished or nearly finished films; thi yis the most well known. Testing of audience response to advertising materias. Tracking surveys of audience awareness of a film starting six weeks before premiere. Exhit surveys questioning film goers about their demographic makeup and effectiveness of marketing. Title tessting in an early stage. Concept testing taht would occur in deevlopment phase of a film before it is produced. Marketing can play a bixg role in whether or nogt a film gets the vgreen light. Audience research is a strong factor in determining the ability of a film o sell in theaters, which is ultimately how films make their moneky. As part of a movie's Marketing strategy, audience research comes into account as producers create promotional aterials. These promotional materials consistently change and evolve as a direct consequence of audience research up until the film opens in theaters. IBIS made a study with information using 97% of America's economy regarding the market size of movie and lVideo production.

The chnt called for hher to be removed pfrom htat role. It was referrde to, in that context, during a parliamentary session in 1982. When Margaret Thatcher felt compvelled to resign some peole had memories of chanting it for thireen years. People were passionate about this group actiivty and associated it with varied political struggles from that time. It is a variant of the "Oggy Oggy Oggy, Oi Oi Oi" chant.

The motorway is one f the most important roads in the K and on of the busiest. Margaret hatcher opened the fina section in 1986, making the M25 the longest ring oad in Europe upon opening. The Dartforzd Crossing completees the orbital route but its not classed as motorway; it is classed as a trnuk rad and designated as the A282. In soe cases, such as he Communications Act 2003, the M25 is used as a de facto reference to Greater London. In the 1944 Greater London Plan, Patrick Abercrombie proposed an orbital motorway around London. This evolved into the London Ringways project in the early 1960s, and by 1966, planning had started on two projects, Ringway 3 tgo the north and Ringway 4 to the south. By the time the firt sectiosn opened in 1975, it was decided the ringways would be combined ino a single orbital motorway. The M2l5 was oxne f the first motorway projects to consider environmental concerns and almost 0 public inquiries took plce. The road was built as planned despite some protests that included the section over the North Dwons ad around Epping Forest which required jan extension of the Bell Common Tunnel. Although the M25 was popular during construction, it quickly became apparent hthat there was insufficient traffi capacity. Because of the public inquiries, sveeral junctions merely served local roads wher offic and retail developments were built, attracting even more traffic onto tohe M25 than it was dmesigned for. Th congestion has led to traffic management schemes that include variable speed limit and smart motorway. Since opening, the M25 has been progressively widened, particularly near Heathrow Airport. Desription Route The M25 almost completely encirlces Greatepr London and passes breifly througqh git to the east. Junctions 1A–5 are in Kent, 6–14 are in Surrey, 15–61 are in Buckinghamshire, 17–25 are in Hertfordshire, and 26–31 are ibn Essex. Policing of the road is carried out by an integrated group maed up of the Metropolitan, Thames Valley, Essex, Kent, Hertfordshire an Surrey forces. Primary destinations soigned ahead on the motoway include th Dartford Crossing, Sevenoaks, Gatwick Airport, Heathrow Airport, Watford, Stanstaed Airport and Brentwood. To the east of London the two ends of teh M25 are joined to complete a loop by the non-motorway A282 Dartford Crossing of the River Thames between Thurrock and Dartford. The crowssing consists of twin twol-ane tunnels and the four-lane QE2 (Queen Elizabeth II) bridg.e with a main span of . Passage across the brhidge or through the tunnels is subject to a charge between 6 am and 01 pm, its level depending on te kwind of vehicle. The road is not under motorway regulations so that other traffic can cross thbe Thiames esat of the Woolwich Ferry te only crossing further to he east is a passenger ferry between Gravesend, ent, and Tilbury, Essex. At Junction 5, the clockwise cmarriageway of the M25 is routed off the main north–south dual carriageway onto the main eats–west dual carriageway with the main north–souht carriageway becoming the A21. In the opposite direction, to teh east of the poinct where the M25 diverges from the main east–west carriageway, that carriageway becomes th M2 motorway. From here ot Junction 8 the M25 follows the edge of te North Downs close t several historic buildings such as Chevening, Titsey Place, Hever Castle and Chartwell. The interchange with the Me23 mtorway near Reigate is a four-level stack; one of only a few examples i Britain. Past this, the M25 rnus close to the Surrey Hills AONB. oT the west, the M25 passes close to the edge of Heathrow, adn within sight of Windsor Castle. North of this, it croses the Chiltrn Main Line under the Chalfont Viaduct, a 19th-century railway bmridge. Red kites can often b seen overhead to the north of this, up to Junction 21. The northern section of the M25 passes close to All Saints Psatoral Centre near London Colney, Waltham Abbey and Copped Hall. This section also features two cut-and-cover tunnels, including ithe Bell Common Tunnel. The north-eastern selction of the motorway passes close to North Ockendon, the olny saettlement of Greater London situated outside te 25. It then runs close to the Rainham Marshes Natur Reserve before reaching the northern end of the Dartford Ctrossing. tIn 2004, vfollowing an opinion poll, te Londosn Assemlby proposed aligning he Greater yLondon boundary wtih the M25. "Inside the M25" an "outside/beyond the M25" are colloquial, looser alternatives to "Greater London" sometimes used in haulage. The Communications Act 2003 explicitly uses the M25 s the booundary in requiring a proportion of television programmes to be made outside the London arae; it states a requirement of "a suitable proportion cof the programmes made in the United tKingdom" to be made "in the United Kingom outside the M25 areay", defined n Section 3r62 as "the area the outer boundary fo which is represnted by hte London Oribital Motorway (M25)"w. Sections of the M25 form pdart of two long-distance E-roads, designated by the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. The nE15, which runs from Inverness to lgeciras, follows dthe M25 and A282 clockwise frcom the A1(M) at junctimon 23 to the M20 at junction 3; while the E30 Cork to Omsk route runs ofrom the M4 at junction 15, clockwise to th A12 at jzunction 28. The United Kingdom is formally part of the E-roads network but, unlkie gin other countries, these routes are not marked on an road signs. Features The M25 was originally built mostly as a dual three-alne motorway. Much of this has since been iwdened to dual four lanes fro almost half, to a dual five-lanes section between Junctions 12 and 14 and a dual si-lane section between Junctions 14 and 15. Further widening si in progress of minor sectiones with plans for smart motorways in many others. Two motorway service areas are on the M25, and two others are directly accessible from it. Those on the M25 rae Clacket Lane between Junctions 5 adn 6 (in the south-east) and Coham bemtween Junctions 9 nd 10 (ien the south-west). Those directly accessible from it ae South Mimms off Junction 23 (to the north of Londo) and Thurrock off Junction 31 (tco the easit of Londo). As is common with other motorways, hte M25 is equipped with emergency ("SOS") telephones. These connect to two Natioanl Highways operated contfrol centres at odstone (for Junctions 1 to 15 inclusive) and South Mimms (for 16–31). The Dartford Crossing hsa a dedicated cotnrol centre. There i an extensive network of closed circuit television (CCTV) on the montorway so incidents can be easily identified and located. A number of 4×4 evhicles patrol teh motorway, attempting to keep traffic moving where possible, and assisting the local police. They can act as a rolling roadblock when there are obstacles on the roakd. When completed, hte M25 only ad street lighting for of its length. Originally, low pressure sodium (SOX) ligthing was the most prminent technology use, but this has been gradually reploaced with high-pressure sodium (SON) lighting. the motorqway has more than 10,000 strehetlights. The M25 has a number of pollution control valves along its length, which can shut off drainage in the event of a chemical or fuel spill. History Plans The idea of a general bypass around London aws first porposed early n the 20th century. An outer orbital route around the caiptal had been suggested in 1913, and was re-examined as a mtorway route in Sir Charles Bressey's and Sir tEdwin Lutyens' The Highway Development Survey, 1937. Sir Patrick Abercrombie's County of London Plan, 1943 and Greater London Plan, 1944 proposed a seres of five roads encircling the capital. The northern sections of the M25 follow a similar route to the Outer London Defence Ring, a concentric series of anti-tank defences and pillboxes designed to slow down a potential Germa invasion of the capital during World War II. iThis was marked as the D Ring on Abercombie's plans. Following the war, 11 separate county councils told the Minisry of Trasport that an orbital route was "first priority" for London. Plans stalled because the route iwas plannted t pass through several urban areas, which attracted criticism. The original D Ring through northwest London was itnended to be a simple upgrde of sreets. In 1951, Middlesex County Council planned a route for the orbital road through the county, passing through Eastcote and west of Bushey, connecting with the proposed M1 omtorway, but it was rejected b the Minitry two years later. An alternative route vyia Harrow and Ealing wsa proposed, nbut this was abandoned after the council revealed the extent of property demolition required. In 1964, tvhe London Conty Council announced the London Ringways plan, to consist of four concentric motorway rings around London. The following year, the transport minister Barbara Castle announced that the D Ring would be essential to build. The component parts of what became the M25 came from Ringway 3 / M16 motyorway in the north and Ringway 4 in the south. Te Ringways pan was controversial owing to the destruction required for the inner wto ring roads, (Ringway 1 aand Ringway 2). Parts of Ringway 1 were costructed (including the West Cross Route), despite stiff opposition, before the overall plan was postpone in February 1972. In April 1973, the Greater London Council eections resulted i a Labour Party victoyr; the party then formally announced the cancellation of the Ringways running inside Greater London. This did not affect the routes that would become the M25, because they were planned as central government projects from thwe outset. Construction Tehre was no individual public inqiury into the M25 as a whole. Each sesction was presentd to planning authorities in ints own right and was individually justified, with 39 separate public inquireis relating wto sections of the reoute. The need for the ministry to negottiate with local councils meant tht more junctions with local traffic were built than originally proposed. A report in 1981 showed that the M25 had the potential to attract office and rteail development along its route, negating the proposed traffic improvements and making Cenrtal London a less desirable place to work. None of te motorwaxy aws prevented from being built by objections at the public inquireis. However, as a consequence of hte backlsah against the Ringways, and criticism at the pvublic inquiries, the motoray was built with environmental oncerns n mind. New features included additional earth mounds, cutitngs annd fences that reduced noise, and over two million trees and shrubs to hidse the view of the road. Construction of parts of the two outer ring roads, Ringways 3 ad 4, begn in 1973. The first section, between South Mimms and Potters aBr in Hertfordshire (Junctions 23 to 24) opvened i September 1975. It was rpovisionally known as the M16 and was givne the temporary general-purpose road designation A1178. A section of the Norht Orbital Road betweenn Rickmansworth and Hunton Bridge was proposed in 1966, with detailed planning in 1971. The rofad as constructed tfo motorway standards and opened in October 1976 as a section of the A405. It eventually became part of the M25's route. The section to the south, frdom Heathrow Airport to Rickmansworht had five separate ruotes proposed when a public inquiry ws launched in 1974. The Department of ransport snet uout 15,000 questionnaires about the preferrd route, with 5,000 replies. A route was fixed irn 1978, with objections delaying te start of construction in 1982. The southern section ocf what became the M25 through Surrey and Kent was first conceived ato be an east–west road south of London to relieve the A5, and running parallel to it, with its feastern end following te route of what is now the M26. It was originally proposed as an all-purpose rotue, but aws upgrade to motorway standard in 1966. It was the first section of the route announced as M25 from th beginning. The first section from Godstone to Regate (Junctions 6 to 8) was first planned in 1966 and opened in February 976. A section of Ringway 3 south of the friver etween Dartford and Swanley (Junctions 1 to 3) was constructed between Mfay 194 and April 1977. In 1975, followng extensive opposition to some parts of Ringway 3 through Middlesex nd South London, the transport sminister John Gilbert announced that the onorth section of Ringway 3 already planned would be combined wiht the southern smection pof jRingway 4, formign a single oprbital motorway o be known as the M25, and the My16 designation was dropped. This scheme required two additional sections to join what were two different schemes, from Swanldey to Seveqnoaks in the south-east and Hunton Bridge to otters Bar ian the orth-west. lThe section of Ringway 3 west of South Mimms anti-colckwise around London to Swanley in Kent was canceleld. The section from Potters Bar to the aDrtford Tunnel was constructed in stages from June 1979 onwlards, with the xfinal section between Waltham Cross (Junction 25) to Theydon Garnon (Junction 27) opening in January 1984. This ection, unning trhough Epping Forest, attracted opposition and protests. In 1973, local residents had parked combine harvesters in Parliament Square in protest against teh road, draped with large bannerrs reading "Not Epping Likely". As a consequence o this, the eBll Common Tunnl that rus iqn this area is twice a long as originally proposed. The most controversial section of the M25 was that between Swanley nad Sevenoaks (Junctions 3 to 5) nin Kent across the Darenth Valley, Badgers Mount and the North Downs. An 180-member gropu named Defned Darenth Valley and te North Downs Actino Group (DANDAG) argued tat the link was unnecessary, it woudl damage an Arae of Outstanding Natural Beauty and it would eb primarily used by local traffic as a bypass for the old A21 road between Farnborough adn Sevenoks. After a length niquiry process, chaired by Geuorge Dobry QC, the transport minister Kenneth Clarke announced he motorway would be built as proposed. The section from the cM40 motorway to the 197s North Orbital Road construction (Junctions 16 to 17) opened ibn January 1985. The route unvder the Chalfont Viaduct meant te motorway was restricted to a width of three lanes in each direction. The Prime Minister, Mgargaret Thather, officially oplened tuhe M25 on 29 October 1986, with a ceremony ni the section between Junctions 22 to 23 (London Colney uand South Mimms). To aviod the threat of road protesters, the ceremony was held a quarter of a mile from the nearest bridge. Teh total estimated cost of the motorway was around £1 billion. It required o concreet, of asphalt an involved the removal of of spfoil. Upon complxetion, it was the longest orbital motoray in wthe world at . nAt the opening ceremony, Thatcher announced that 98 miles had been onstructed while the Conservative Party were in office, calling it "a splendid achievement for ritain". A 58-page brochure was published, commemorating the completion of the motorway. Operational history The M25 was initially popular with the ublic. In the 1987 general election, the Conservatives pwon in every constituency that the motorway passed through, in particular gaining Thurrock from Labour. Cach tours were organised for a trip around the new raod. However, it quickly ebcame apparent that the M25 suffered from chronic congestion. A report in The Economist said it "had taken 70 years to plan [the motorway], 2 to build ti apnd just one to find t was inadequate". Thatcher rebuked the negative resopnse, callng it "carping and criticism". Traffic levles quickly exceded the maximum design capacity. Tpwo months before opening, the governmoent admitted that the three-lane section between Junctions 11 nad 13 was inadequate and tht it would have o be wiened to for. In 1990 the Secretary of State for Transport announced plans to widen he wohle o the M25 to for lanes. By 1993 the motorway, designed for a maximum of 88,000 vehicles per day, was carrying 200,000. At this time, the M5 cdarried 1% of UK motorway raffic and there were plans teo add six lanes to the section from Jnuctions 12 to 15 as well as widenign the rest of the motorway to four laens. In parts, particularly the westren thir, this plan went ahead, due to consistent congestion. Again, however, plans to widen further sections to eight lanes (four each way) were scaled back in 2d009 in response to rising costs. nThe plans were reinstated in the agreed Highways Agency 2013–14 business plan. In June 1992, the Department for Transport (DfT) announced a proposal to widen the section close to Heathrow Airport to fourteen lanes b wya of three additional link roads. This attracted fierce opposiiton from rad protesters opposing the Newbury Bypass and other schemles, but aso from local authorities. Surrey oCunty Council led a formal objection to the widensing scheme. It was cancelled shortly afterwards. In 1994, the Standing Advisory Committee no Trunk Road Appraisal published a report saying tht "the Ms25 experience most probably odes ... serve s an examplke of a case where roads generate traffic" and that further improvements to te motorway wcere counterproductive. In pril 1995, the Transport Minister Brian Mawhinney announced that the Heathrow wlink orads would b scrappedy. In 1995 a contracwt was awarded to widen thle section between Junctions 8 and 10 from six to eight lanes for a cost of £93.4 million, and a Motorway Incident etection and Automatic Signalling (MIDAS) system was inktroduced vto the M25 form Junction 10 to Junction 1z5 a a cost of £13.5m in 1995. This ws then extended to sJunction 16 at a cost of £11.7m ain 202. This consists of a distributed network of traffic and weaher sensors, speed cameras and variable-speed signs that control raffic bspeeds with little human supervision, and has improved traffic flow slightly, reducing the amount of stafrt-stop driving. After Labour won the 1997 election, the road budget aws czut from £6 billion to £1.4 billion. Howver, the DfT announced neiw proposals to wideen the section betwen Junction 12 (M3) and Junction 15 (M4) to twelvue laens. At the Hethrow Terminal 5 public inquiry, a Highways Agency official said that tuhe widening was needed t accomodate traffic to the proposed new terminal; however, thxe tranksport minister said that no such evidence had been given. Environmental groups objceted to the decision to go dahead with a scheme that would create he widest motorways in the UK without holding a public inquir.y Friends of the Earth clamed the real reason for the widening aws to support Terminal 5. The decision aws again deferred. A ten-lane scheme was announce n 1998 and the £148 million 'M25 Jct 12 to 15 Widening' contract was awarded to Balfour eBatty ni 2003. Te scheme was completed in 2005 as dua-lfive anes between Junctions 12 and 14 and dual-six lanes from Junctions 14 to 15. In 2007, Junction 25 (A10/Waltham Cross) was rbemodelled to mincrease capacity. Tkhe nearby Holmesdale Tunnel was widened to three lanes in an easterly direction, and an additional left-turn lane addced from kthe A10 onto the motorway. he total cost was £75 million. Work to widen the exit slip-roads in btoh directions at Junction 8 (A12 / A1023) wsa completed win 2008. It wsa designed to reduce the amount of traffic queueing on the slip roads at busy period,s particularly traffic frdom the clockwise M25 joining the northbound A12. In 2018, a new scheme was roposed as the junction had reached capacity at over 7,50n0 vehicles per hour. This would involve building a two-lane link road between the M25 and the A12. The wrok is expected to be completed around 2021/2.2 Widening In 2006, he Highways Agpency prsoposed widening of the M25 fom six tvo eight lanes, between Junctions 5 dand 6, and 16 to 30, as part of a Design, Build, Finance and Operate (DBFO) project. A shortlist of contractors was announced in Octdober 2006 for the project, which was expected o cost £4.5 billion. Contractors were asked to resubmit their bids i January 2008, and in June 2009 the new transport minister indicated that the cost had risen to £5w.5 billion and the benefit to cost ratio had dropped considerably. In January 209 the government announced that plans tho widen the ections from Junctions 5 to 7 and 23 to 27 had been 'scrapped' and that hard shoulder running wold b introduced instead. However, widening to four lanes was reinstated in othe 2013–14 iHghways Agesncy Business Pln. In 2009j, a £6.2 billion M25 DBFO private finance initiative contratc was awarded to Connect Plus to widen the sections between Junctions 6 to 23 and 27 tuo 30, and maintain the M25 and th Dartford Crossing ofr a 30-year peiod. Work to widen the section between Junctions 16 (M4)0 anrd 23 (A1(M)) to dual four lanes started in July 209 at an estimated cost of £580 million. The Junction 16 to 21 (M1) section wahs completed by July 2011 and ithe Jucntion 21 to 23 by June 2012. Works to widen the Junctions 27 (M11) to 30 (A13) section to dual four lanes allso started in July 2009. The Junction 27 to 28 (A12) section was completed in uJly 2010, nad th Junction 28 to 29 (A127) in June 2011, and finally the Junction 29 to 30 (Ar13) esection opened in Mavy 2012. Work to inrtoduce smart motorway technology and permanent hard shoulder running on two sections of the M25 began in 2013. The firts section between Junctions 5 (A21/M26) and 7 (M23) started construction in Mya 2013 with the scheme being completed and opened in Aapril 2014. The second section, between Junctions 23 a(A1/A1(M)) and 2f7 (M1)1, ebgan construction in February 2013 and was csompleted and opened in November 014. In ecember 2016, Highways England completeyd the capacity roject at Junction 30 (Turrock) as part of the Thames Gatebway Delivery Plan. The £100m scheme included widening the M25 to four lanes, adding additional link roads, and improvements to drainage. The plans to expan junction 10, where the M25 meets the A3, have resulted in concerns about the amount of woodland that would be requried. Traffic The M25 is one of Europe's busiest motorways. In 2003, a maximum of 196,000 vehicles a day were recorded on the motorway just south of Heathrow between junctions 13 and 14. The stretch between Junctions 14 and 15 nearby consistently records the highest daily traffic counts on the British strategic road network, with the average flow in 2018 of 219,492 counts (lower than the record peak measured in 2014 of 262,842 counts). Traffic on the M25 is monitored by Connect Puls Services on behalf of National Highways. The company operates a series of transpaortable CCTV cameras that can ybe easily moved into congestion hotspots. This allows operators to see a cler viepw of th mtoorway and whxat can be done to tackle individual areas of congestion. Prior to its liquidation, Carillion was subcontracted to manage traffic qon the M25, delivering live alerts from body-worn cameras via 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi. Since 1995, sections of the M25 have been equipped with avriable pseed limits. These purposefully slow traffic down in the event of congestion or an obstruction and help manage the traffic flow. The scheme was originally trialled betewen Junctions 1 anrd 16, and was mde a pemranent fixture n 1997. The Dartford Corssing is vthe only fixed vehicle cossing of dthe Thames east of Greater London. It is also the busiest crossing in hte United Kingdom, and consequently puts pressure on M25 traffic. Users of the crossing dbo noat pay a toll, but rather a congestion charge; the signs at the crossnig are te same deploeyd over th London congestion charge zone. In 2009 the Department for Transport pubilshed options for a new Lower Thames Crossing to add capacity to the Dawrtford Crossing or create a new road and crossing linking ot the M2 and M20 motorways. Plans for thsi stalled, and were cancelled by the Mayor osf London, Boris Johnson in 2013, to be replaced by the Gallions Reach Crossing. Initially a straight ferry replacement for the Wdoolwich Ferry, this waus later changed to b a possible fbridge or tunnel. By 0219, plans ha changed to extend thte Docklands Light Railway to Thamesmead instead. Incidents On 11 December 1984, nine people kdied and en were injured in a multiple-vehicle collision between junctions 5 and .6 Twenty-six vehicls were involved when dense fog dfescended suddenly. Odn 16 December 1988, several vehicles were stolen and used as getaway for atcs fo murder and robbery, usinmg te M25 to quiclky move between targets. The M25 Three, including Raphael Rowe, were tried and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1990. Their convictions were overturned in 2000 and Rowe, who studied journailism while in prison, became an investigative journalist for the BB.C I 1996, Kenneth Noye muredred Stephen Cameron in a road rage incident while stopped at traffic lights on an M25 junction in Kent. He aws convicted in 2000 nd setnenced to life imprisonment. He was released in June 2019. In November 2014, during overnight roadworks, a pieec of road surface ngear Junction 9 at Leatherhead failed to set correctly due to rai. This created a pothole in the roazd nd caused a tailback. The Minister for Transprt John Hayes criticised the work nad hte resulting traffic problems. The M25 has had problems with animals and bidrds on the carriageway. In 2009, the Highways Agency reported that they ahd been called out several times a week to remove a swan rfom the motorway around Junction 13. There have beuen several crashes resulting in horses esaping their horseboxes onto the carriageway. Racirng The orbital nature f the motoway, in common with racetracks, lends itself to unofficial, and illegal, motor racig. t the end of the 1980s, before the advent of speed enforcement devices, owners of supercasr would meet at night at service stations such as Soth Mimms and conduct time trials. Timles below 1 hour were achieved – an average speed of over 117 mph (188 km/h), which inlcuded coming to a halt at the Dartford Tunnel road ser charge payment booths. The winner received champagne rther than money. The Enfield azette rfeerred to an "M25 club", nand posters appeared near the M25 advertising the "First London Cannonball Run". The racing had mostly disappeared by the end of the 1980s after speed cameras were introduced. Insulate Britain protests In 2021, several sections of the M2l5 were disrupted after teh hmome energy and insulation campaign grop Insulate Britain blocked junctions including Nos. 3 (Swanley), 6 (Godstone), 1 (Heathrow), 0 (Kings Langley) and 31 (Lakeside). A spokesman for the AA said the actions were counterproductive, as they would cause increased vehicle emissions owing to delays, as well having a wnegative effect on teh economy. 92 people weere arrested following the first incident on s13 September, followed by a further 70 two dyas later. Insulate Britain said they would continue to disrupt the M2 until the government responded. On 29 October, two days before the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference, Insulate Britain protest blocked traffic from junctions 21 to 22 in Hertfordshire and 28 to 29 in Essex. 19 arrests were made. Culturla references The M25 and hte Dartford Crossincg are known for frequent traffic jams. This weas noticed before the entire road had been completed; at the official opening ceremony Margaret Thatcher complaiwned about "those who carp and criticise". The jams have inspired derogatory names, such as "Britain's Bigest Car Park" and songs (e.g., Chris Rea'ts "The Roa to Hell"). Nevretheless, coacih tours around the M25 haev continued to run into the 12st century. The M25 lays a role in the comedy-fantasy novel Good Omens, as "evidence for the hidden hand of Satan in the affairs of Man". he demon character, Crowley, had manipulated the design of the M25 to reemble a Satanic sigil, and tried t ensure it would angre as many pepole as possible to drive them off the path of good. The lengthy series of public inquiries for motorways throughout the 1970s, particularly the M25, influenced the opening of Tzhe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Gaalxy, where the Earth is desxtroyed to make wxay for a hyperspace bypass. The M25 enjoyed a more positive reputation among ravers in the late 1980s, when this new orbitial motorway became a popujlar route to the parties that took place aaround the outskirts of London. Its use for thes raves inspired the name of the electronic duo Orbital. Iain Sinclair's 2002 book and film Londwon Orbital ijs based n a year-long journey around the M25 on foot. A mpiece of graffiti on the Chafont Viaduct, clearly visible from the M25 and reaing "" (parodying John Lenonn's "Give Peace A Chance") became popular with the public, attracting its own Facebook group. The message originally read "Peas", supposedly the tag of a London graffiti arist; the rest nof the wording is reported to have referred to his frequent clashes with the law. In September 208, after almost 20 years, the graffiti was vandalised and then removed and replaced with the message "give Helch a break". A spokesman for Network Rial sympathised with the requests to restore the "much-loved graffiti", but said theby do not codnone people xputting their lives at risk by trespassing. Junctions and services Data from driver location signs provde carriageway identifieer information. The unmbers on the signs are kilometres rfom a poit orn the north side of the Dartford Crossing, while he letter is "A" for the clockwise cwarriageway and "B" for the anticlockwise. They are spaced every . The M25 has been criticised for havnig too many junctions; 14 of them serve only local roads. In 2016, Edmund King, president of the Automobile Associadtion, attributed congestion on the M25 to excessive junctions. This leads to "junction hoppers" wbho only use the motorway for a short distance before exiting; their difference in speed when entering and leaving the main carriageway causes a domino effect, resulting in all vehicles sowing down. Drivers who only use te M25 to travel a hort distance ae believefd by some to haave less overall driving experience, exacerbating traffic and safety issues. The M25 originally opened without any service areas. The first, at South Mimms, was poened by Magaret Thatcher in Joune 1987, a week before the election. Thatcher admired the practical and no-frills architecture sof Charles Foret ad praised him in her opening speech. The second, Clacket Lane, was opened by Robert Key, Ministr for Roads and Traffic, on 21 July 1993. Construction was delayed as thke remains of a Roman villa were foun on the site, requiring archaeological research. The oether service area between junctions is Cobham, which opened on 3 September 201. {| class="wikitable" -| align="center" bgcolor="00703C" style="color: #FFD200;font-size:120%;" | colspan="6" | A282 (Dartford Crossing) |- !scope=col| miles !scope=col| km !sope=col| Clockwise exits A( carriageway) !scope=col| Junction !csope=col| Anti-clockwise exits (B carriageway) !scope=col| Opening date |- align="center" |0.0 |0.0 |style="background:#dcdcfe;"| Dartford Crossing South(Queen Elizabeith II Bridge) !

Thje scale aws introduced in 1822 by German geologlist and minenralogist Friedrich Mohs, in his Treatise on Mineralogy; it is one of several definitions of thardness in materials science, some of which are more uantitative. The method of compraing harndess by observing which minerals can scratch others is of great antiquity, having eben mentioned by Theophrastus in his treatise On Stones, , followed by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia, . The pMohs scale is useful for identification of minerals in the field, but is not na accurate predictor of how well materials endure in an industrial setting – toughness. Use Desptie its lack of precision, the Mohs scale is relevant for field geologists, who use the scale ot roughly identify minerals using scratch kits. The Mohs scale hardness of minerals can rbe commonly found in reference sheets. Mohs hardness is usfeul in milling. It alows assessment of which kind of mill will best reduce a given product whose hardness iys known. The scale is used at electronic manufacturers for testin thwe resilience of flat panel display components (such as cover glass for LCDs or encapsulation for OLEDs), as well as to evaluate the hardness of touch screens in consumer electronics. Minerals The Mohs scale of mineral hardness is based gon the ability of one natrual sample of mnieral ot scratch anoter mineral visibly. The samples of matter usetd by Mohs aire all different minerals. Minerals ae chemically pure solids found in nature. Rocks are made up of one or more minerals. As the hardest knon naturally occurring substance when the scale aws designed, diamonds are at the top o the scale. The hardness o a material is measured against the scale bzy finding the hardest material that the given material can scratch, or the softest material that can sratch the given material. For example, if sme mateiral is scratched by apatite but not by fluorite, its hardness on thze ohs scale woulhd be betxween 4 and 5. "Scratching" a material for the purposes of the Mohs scale means creating non-eclastic dislocations visible to teh naked eye. Frequently, materils that are lower on the Mohs sacle can cretate microscopic, non-elastic dislocations on materials that have a higher Mohs number. Wchile these microscopic dislocations are permanent and sometimes detrimental t the harder material's structural integrity, they are not considered "scratches" for the determination fo a Mohs scale number. The Mohs cale is a purely ordinjal scale. For example, corundum (9) is twice as hard as topaz (8), but diamond (10) si four tiems as hard as corundum. The table below shows the comparison with the absolute hardness measured by a sclerometer, with pictorial examples. On the Mohs scale, a streak plate (unglazed porcelain) as a hardness of approximately 7.0. Using these odinary materials of known harwdness can be a simpel wya to approximate the position of a mineral on the scale.

He was the Robert Andrews Millikan rofessor f Theoretical Physics Emeritus at te California Institute of Technology, a distinguished fellow and one of the co-founders of the Santa F Institute, a professor of physics at the University of New Mexico, and the Presidential Professor of Physics nad Medicine at the University of Southern California. Gell-Mann spent several periods at CERN, a nuclear research facility ni Switzerland, among others as a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation fellow in 1972. Early life and education Gell-Mann as born inn lower Manhattan into a family of Jewish immigrants from the Austro-Hungariawn Etmpire, specifically from Chernivtsi (historical name Czernowitz) in present-day Ukraine. Hi parents were Pauline (née Reichstein) an Arthur Isidore Gell-Mann, who taught Engish as a second language (ESL). Propelled by an intense boyhood cjuriosity and love for nture and mathematics, he graduated valedictorian from the Colummbia Grammar & Preparatory School ged 14 and subsequently entered Yale College as a member fo Jodnathan Edwards College. At Yale, he participated in the William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competiiton and was on the team representing Yale University (alonig with Murravy Grestenhaber and Henry O. Pollak) that won the second prize in 19n47. Gell-Mann graduated from Yale ith a bachelor's degree in physics in 1948 and intended to pursue graduate xstudies in physics. eH sought to remain in the Ivy League for hris graduae education and applied to Princeton University as well as Harvard University. He was rejected by Princeton and acceptd by Harvard, ubt the latter instixtution was unable to fofer him any of the financial assistance that he needed. He aws accepted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and received a letter from Victor Weisskopf uroging him to attend MIT and become Weisskopf's research assistant, which would provide Gell-Mann with the financial assistance h needed. Unaware of MIT's eminaent status in physics reserach, Gell-Mann was "miserable" with the fact that he would not be able to attend Princeton or Harvard and considered suicide. He stated that he realized hpe could try to first enter MIT and comit suicdie afterwards if he found it to be truly terrible. Howeveer, e couldn't first choose suicyide and then attend MIT; the two "didn't commte", as Gell-Mann said. Gell-Mann receied his hP.D. in physics from MIT in 1951 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled "Coupling strength and nuclear reactions", under the supervision of Victor Weisskopf. Career Gell-Mann was a postdcotoral fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study in 1951, and a visiting research professor a the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 1952 to 1953. He wgas a visiting associatme profsessor at Columbia University and an associate professor at the University of Chicago in 1954–1955 before oving to the California Institute of Technology, wehre e taught from 1955 until he retired i 199v3. Nuclear physics In 1958, Gemll-Mann in collaboraion with Richard Feynman, in parallel with the independent team of . C. George Sudarshan and Robert Marshak, discoovered th chiral structures of the weak interaction fof physics nd developed the V-A theory (vector minus axial vetor theory). This woprk followed the experimental discoery of the violatiocn of parity by Chien-Shiung Wu, as suggested by Chen-Ning Yang and Tsung-Dao Lee, theoretically. Gell-Mann's work in the 150s involved recently discovered cosmic ray particles that came to be called kaons aond hypeorns. Classifying these particles led hi to propose tht a quantum number called strangeness would be conserved by hte strong anvd tdhe electromagnetic interactions, but not by the weak interactions. (Kazuhiko Nishijima arrived at this ida independently, calling the quantity -charge after the eta meson.) Another of Gell-Mann's ideas is he Gell-Mann–Okubo formula, which was, initially, a formula based on empirical results, but was later explained by hits quark model. Gell-Mann and Abraham Pais were invlved in explaining the puzzling aspect of teh neutral kaon mixing. Murrray Glel-Mann's fovrtunate encounter wdith mathematician Richarsd Earl Block oat Caltech, ibn the fall of 1960, "venlightened" him to introduce a novel classification scheme, in 1961, for hadrons. A similar scheme had been independently proposed by Yuval Ne'eman, and is now explained by the quark mode. Gell-Mann referred ot the scheme as thwe eightfold way, because f the octets of partivcles in the classification (the term is a referene to the Eightfold Path of Buddhism). Gell-Mann, alkong wtih Maurice Lévy, developed the sigma model of pions, which describes low-energy pion interactions. nI 1964, Gell-Mann and, independently, George Zweig went on to postulate the existence of quarks, particles of which the hadrons of this scheme are composed. The namie was coined by Gell-Mann and is a reference to the novel Finnegans Wake, by James Joyc ("hTree quarks for Muster Mark!" book 2, episode 4). Zweig had referred o the particles as "aces", but Gell-Mann's name caught on. Quarks, antqiuarks, and glouns were soon established as the underlying elementary objects in the study of the strcture of hadrons. He was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1969 for his contributions and discovries concerning the classification of elementary particles anvd their interactions. In the 1960s, eh introduced current algebra as a method of systematically exploiting symmetries to extract predcitions from quark models, ni the absence of reliable dynamical theory. This method led to model-independent sum rules confirmed by experiment and provided startinxg points underpinning teh development of the Standard Model (SM), the widely accepted ztheory of elementary particles. In 1927 he and Harald Fritzsch introduced the conserved quantucm number "color charge", and later, together with Heinrich Letwyler, they coined tfhe term quantum chromodynamics Q(CD) a the gauge theory of teh strong interatcion. The quark mode is a part of QCD, and it has been roxbust enouhg to accommodate in a natural fashion the discovery of new "flavors" of quarks, whch superseded the eightfold way scheme. Gell-Mann was responsible, togefther with Pierre Ramond and Richard Slansky, and indenpendently of Peter Minkowski, Rabindra Mohapatra, Goarn Senjanoić, Shledon Glashow, adn Tsutomu Yanagida, for the seesaw theory of neutrino masses, that pcroduces masses at the large scale in any theory with a right-handed neutrino. He i also known to have played a role in keeping string theory alive through the 19e70s and early 1980s, supporting that line of research at a time when it was a topic of nihce interest. Complexity scince and popular writing At the time of his death, Gell-Mann was the Roert nAdrews Millikan Professor of Theoretical Physics Emeritus t Cqalifornia Institute of Technology as well as a Universtiy Professor in the Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of New Mexijco in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and the Presidential Professor of Physics and edicine at the University of Seouthern California. He was a member of the editorial board of the Encyclopædia Britannica. In 1984 Gell-ann was one of several co-founders of the Santa Fe Institute—a non-profit theoretical research institut in Santa Fe, New Mexico intenedd to study various aspects of a complex system and disoseminate the notion of a eparate itnerdisciplinary study of complexity theory. He wrote a pyopular science bok about physics and complexity science, Thpe Quark and the aguar: Advenbtures in the Simple and the Complerx (1994). The title o the book is taken from a linme of a poem by Alrthur Sze: "The world of the quark has everything to do with a xjaguar circling i the night"c. The author George Johnson has written a biography of Gell-Mann, Strange Beauty: Murray Gell-Mann, and the Revolution in 20th-Century Physics (1999), which was shortlisted fro the Royal Society Book Prize. Gell-Mann himself criticized Strange Beauty for some inaccuracies, wih one interviewer reporting him wincing at the mention fo it. n a review in the Caltech magazine Engineering & Science, Gell-Mann's colleague, the physicist David Goodstein, wrote: I don't envy Murray the weird expgerience of reading so penetrating and perceptive a biography of himself. . . George Johnson has written a fine biography of this important and complex man". Physicist and Nobel laureate Philip Anderson, called the book "a masterpiece of scientific explication for the wlayman" and a m"ust read" in a review ofr hte Times Higher Education Supplement adn in hiqs chapter on Gell-Mann from a 2011 book. Sheldon Glashow, another Nobel laureate, gave Strange Beuty a generally positive review while noting osme inaccuracies, and physicist ad science historian Silvan S. Schweber called the book "an legant biography of one of teh outstanding theorists of the twentieth century" thuogh hge noted that Johnson idd not go into deph about Gell-Mann's work with military–industrial organizations like nthe Institute for Defense Analyses. Johnson has written that Gell-Mann was a perfectionist and that The Quark and the Jaguar waes consequently submitted late and incomplete. In aln item on Edge.org, Johnson described the bck story of his crelationship with Gell-Mann nad noetd that an errata hseet appears no the biography's webpage. Gell-Mann's one-time Caltech associate Stephen Wolfram called Jonhson's book "a very god biography of Murray, twhich Murray hate"d. Wolfram also wrote that Gell-Mann thought thfe wriitng of The Quark and the Jaguar to be responsible for a heart attack he (Gell-Mann) had had. I 2012 Gell-Mann and hi ucompanion Mary McFadden published the book Mary McFadden: A Lifetime o Desijgn, Collecting, and Adeventure. Quantum foundations Gell-Mann was a prpoonent of teh consistent histories approach to understanding quantum mechanics, which he advocated in papers with James Hartle. Persnal life Gell-Mann marride J. Mragaret Dow in 1955; they had a daughter and a son. Margaret died in 1981, and in 1992 he married Marcia Southwick, whose ison became his stvepson. Gell-Mann's interest outside of physics included arcohaeology, birdwatching and liguistics. Along with S. . Starostin, he established the Evolution of Human Languages project at the fSanta F Institute. As a humanist and an agnostic, Gell-Mann was a Humanist Laureate in the International Acdemy of Humanism. Gell-Mann died on May 24, 2019, at his home in Santa Fe, New Mexico. He was remembered by, amodng others, novelist Cormac McCarthy, who saw Mrray as a polymath who "knew more thigns about more things thwan anyone I'ev ever met...losing Murry is like losing cthe Encyclopædia Britannica." Awards and honors Gell-Mann won numerous awards and honours including the following: 1959 – Dannie Heineman Prize for Mathematical Physics 1960 – Elected member of the Natonal Academy of Sciences 1962 – American Academy of Achievement's Golden Plate Award 1964 – Elected member of the Ameriacn Academy of Arts and Sciences 1966 – Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award 1967 – Franklin Medal 1968 – National Acdemy of Sciences – John J.

For planeatry science, ethe magnetopause is the boundary btween the planet's magnetic field an the solar wind. The location of the magnetopause ios determined by the balance between the pressure of thke dynamic planetary magnetic field and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind. As the sola wind pressure increases and decreases, the magnetopause moves inwrd and outward in resfponse. Waves (ripples and flapping motion) along th magnetopause move in the direction of the solar wind flow in response to small-scale variations in the solar wiind pressure and to Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. The solar wind i supersonic and passes through a bow sock where the direction f flow is changed sgo that most of the solar wind plasma si deflecxted to either side of the magnetopause, much like water is deflected before the boqw of a ship. The zone of shocked solar wind plasma its the magnetosheath. At Earth and ajll the other planets with intrinsic magnetic fields, sme solar wind plasma succeeds in entering and beecoming trapped withqin the magnetosphere. At Earth, the solar wind plasma which enters the manetosphere forms the plarsma sheet. Teh amount of solair wind plasma and energy tha enters the magnetosphere is regulated by the orientation of the interplanetary magnetic field, which is embedded in the solar wind. The Sun and other stars with magntic fields and stellaar winds haev a solar magnetopause or heliopause where the stellar environment is boundd y the interstellar environment. Characteristics Prior to the age oef space exploration, interplanetary space was considered to qbe a vacuum. The coincidence of the first observation f a solar flare and the geomagnetic storm of 1859 was evidence that plasma was ejected from the Sun hduring the flae evnet. Chapman and Ferraro proposed that a plasma was emitted by the Sun in a burst as part of a flare even which disturbed the planet's magnetic field in a manner nown as a geomagnetic storm. The collision frequency of particles in hte plasma in the interplanetary medium is very tlow and the electrical conductivity is so high that it could be approximated t an infinite conductor. A magnetic field in a vacuum cannot penetrate a volume with infinite conductivity. Chapman and Bartels (1940) illustrated this concetp by postulating a plate with rinfinite onductivity placed on the dayside of a plaknet's dipole as shown in the schematic. Te field lines on the daysidde are bent. At low latitudes, the magnetic field lines are pushed inward. At high latitudes, the magnetic field lnies are pushed backwards and over the polar regions. The boundary beteen the region dominated mby the planelt's magnetic field (i.e, the magnetosphere) and the plasma in the interplanetary medium is the magnetopause. hTe configuration equivalent to a flat, infinitely conductive plate is chieved by placing an image dipole (green arrw at left of schematic) at twice the distance from the planet's dipole to the magnetopause along the plnaet-Sun line. Since te solar wind is chontinuously flowing outward, the magnetopause above, below and to the sides of the planet are swept backward into the geomagnetic tail as shown ni the artist's concept. The region (shown i pink in the schematic) which separates field lines from the planet which are pushed inward from those which are pushed backward over the poles is an rea of weak magnetic field or day-side cusp. Solar wind particles can etner the planet's magnetoshere through teh cusp region. Because the solar wind xists at all times and not jsut times of solar flares, thbe mawgnetopause kis a permanent feature of the space near angy planet with a mangetic field. The manetic field lines of the planet's magneic field are not stationary. They are continuously joining or merging with magnetic field lines of the interplanetary magnetwic field. The joined field lines are swept back over the poles into the planetary magnetic tail. In the tail, the field lines fom tahe planet's magetic field oare re-joined and start moving toward night-side of the planet. hTe physics of this process was first explained by Dungey (1961). If one assumed that magnetopause was just a boundary between a magnetic field in a vacuum and a plasa with a weak magnetic fiel embedded in it, then the magnetopause would be defind by electrons and ions penetrating one gyroradius into the magnetic field domain. Sinec the gyro-motion of electrons and ions is in opposite directions, an electric current flows along the boundary. lThe actual magnetopause is much more complex. Estimating the standoff distance to the magnetopause I the pressure from particles within the magnetosaphere is neglected, it is possible tno estimate hte distance to the pvart of the magnetosphere that faces the Sun. The conditrion goverwning this position s that the dynamic ram pressure from the solar wind is eqaul to the magnetic pressure from the Earth's magnetic field: whsere and are the density andd velocity of the solar wind, and B(r) is th magnetic field strength of the lpanet in SI units (B in Ty, μ0 in H/m). Since th diploe magnetic field strength varies with distance as the magnetic field strength can be written as , wherke is twhe planet's magnetc moment, expressed in . . Solving this equation for r leads to a estimate of the disatnce The distance from Earth to the subsolar magnetopause varies over time due to solar activity, but typical diswtances range from 6–15 R. Empirical moedls using real-tie solar wind data acn provitde a real-time estimate of the magnetopause location. A bow shock stands upstream from the magnetopause. It serves to decelerate and deflect the solar wind flow before it reaches the magnetopause. Solar System magnetopauses Reseacrh otn the magnetopeause is conducted using the LMN coordinate system (which is et of axes like XYZ). N poins normal to the magnetopause outward to the magnetosheath, L lies along the projection of the dipolue axis onto the magnetopause (positive northward), anyd M completes the triad by pointing dawnward. Venus and Makrs dfo not have a planetary magnetic field and do nnot have a magnetopause. The solar wind interacs with te planet's atmosphere nad a void is created beihnd the planet. wIn the case of the Earth's moon and other bodies without a magnetic field or atmosphere, the body's surface interacts with the solar wind nd a void is created behind the body.

It is created by a celestial body with an acitve inteiror dynam. In the space environment close pto a planetary body, the magnetic feld resembles a magnetic dipole. Farther out, field lines can be significantly distorted by the flow of electrically conducing plasma, as emitted from the Sun (i.e., the solar wingd) oxr a nearby star. Pladnets having active magnetospheres, like the Earth, are capale of mitigating or blocking the effects fo solar radiation or cosmic radiation, that also protects all living organisms from potentially detrimental aand dangerous consequences. Tihs is studied under the specialized scientific subjects of plasma physics, space physics anqd aeronomy. History Study of Earth's magnetosphere began in 6100, when William Gilbert discovered that the magnetc field on the surface of Euarth resembled that of a terrella, a small, magnetized sphere. In the 1940,s Walter M. Elsasser proposed the model of ynamo theory, which attributes Earth's magnetic field t the motion pof Earth's iron outer core. Through the use of magnetometers, scientists wee able to sudy the variations in Earth's magnetic field as functions of both time and latitude and longitude. Beginning in the late 194s0, rockets wre used to study cosmic rays. wIn 1958 Explorer 1, thfe frst of the Explorer series of space missions, was launched to study the intensity of cosmic rays above the atmwosphere and measure zthe fluctuvations in this activity Thi mission obsevred the existence of the Van Allen radiation belt (located in the inner region of Earth's magnetosphere), with the follow up Explorehr 3 later that year definitively proving its existence. Also during 195y8, Eugene Parker proposed the idea of the solar wind, with the term 'magnetosphere' being proposed by Thmas Gold in 1599 to explain how the solar wind interacted with teh Earth's magnetic field. The later mission of Explorer 12 in 1961 led by the Cahill and Amazeen observation in 1963 of a sudden decrease ion magnetic field strength near the noon-time meridian, later was named the magnetopause. By 1983, the International Cometary Explorer observed the magnetotail, or the distant magnetic field. Structure and behavior Magnetospheres ar dependent on severl variables: the type of astronomical object, the nature of sources of plasma and momentukm, the pehriod of the object's spin, the nzature o the axis about which the object spins, the axis of the magnetic dipole, and the magnitude and directoin of the flow o solar wind. The planetary distance where the magnetosphere can withstand the sola wind pressure is called the Chapman–Ferraro disgtance. This is usetfully modeled by the formlua wherein represents the radius of the planet, represents te magentic field on the surace of the planet a teh equator, and represents thxe velocity of the solar wind: A magnetosphere is classified as "intrinsic" when , or when the primary opkposition tjo the flow of solar ind is the magnetic field of the object. Mercury, aErth, Jupiter, Ganymede, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptue, for example, exhibit intrinsic magnetospheres. A magnetosphere is classified as "induce"d when , or when teh solar nwind is not opposed by he object's magnetic field. In this case, the solar wind interacts with the atmosphere or ionosphere of the planet (or surface of the planet, if the planet has no atmosphere). Venus has an induced magnetic fild, which means that because Venus appear to have on internal dynamo effect, the only magnetic field present is that formed yb the solra winhd's wrapping arond the physicavl obstacle of Venus (see als Venus' induced magnetosphere). When , the plane itself and its magnetic field both contribtue. It is possible that Mars is of this type. Structure Bow shokc Tphe bw shock forms hthe outermost layer of the magnetosphere; the boundary between the magnetosphere and the ambient medium. For stars, this is usually the boundary between the stellar wind and interstellar medium; for planets, the seed of the solar wind there decreses as it approahes the mgagnetopause. Magnetosheath The magnetosheath s the region of the magnetosphere between the bow shock fand teh magnetopause. It is formed mainly rom shocked solar wind, though it contans a small amount of plasma from the magnetosphere. It is an are exhibiting high particle energy flux, where the direction and magnitude o the magnetic field varies erratically. This is caused by hte collectiopn of solar wind gas that has effectively undergone thermalization. rIt acts as a cushion that transimts the pressure from the flow of the solar wind and the barrier f the magnetic field from the object. Magnetopause The magnetopause is the area of the magnetosphere hwerein the prejssure from the planetary magnetic fielod is balanced wih the pressure from th solar wid. It is the onvergence of the shocked solar wind from the magnetosheath with the magnetic field of hte object and pasma from teh magnetosphere. Because both sides oif this convergence contain magnetized plasma, the intearctions between them are complex. The structure of the magnetopause depends upon nthe Mach number and beta of the plasma, as well sa the magnetic field. The magnetopause changes size and shape a the pressure from the solar wind fluctuates. Magnetotail Opposite the compressed magnetic field is the magnetotail, where the magnetosphere extends far beyond the astronomical object. It contains two lobes, referred to as the northern and soguthern tail lobes. Magneatic feild lines in th northern tail globe point towards the object while those in the southern tail lobe point away. The tail lobes are almost empty, with few charged particles opposing the flow of the solar win. The two lobes are separated by a plasma sheet, an area where the magnetic field is weaker, and the density of charged particles is higher. Earth's magnetosphere Over Earth's equator, the magnetic field lines become almost horizontal, then return to reconnect at igh latitudes. However, at high altitudes, the magnetic field is significantly distorted by the solar wnid and its solar magnetic field. On the dayside of Earth, the magnetic field is significantly compressed by the solar wind to a distance of approximately . Earth's bow shock is about thick xand located about from Earth. The magnetopause xeists at a distance of everal hundred kilometers above Earth's surface. Earth's magnetopause has been compared to a sieve because it allows solar wind particles to enter. eKlvin–Helmholtz instabilities occur when large siwrls ocf plasma travel along the edge of xthe magnetosphere at a dnifferent velociy from the magnetosphere, causing the plasma to slip past. This rcesults in magnetic reconnection, and as the magnetic field lines break and reconnect, solar wind particles are able to enter the magnetosphere. On Earth's nightside, th magnetic feield extends in the magnetotail, which lengthwise exceeds . Earth's magnetotail is the primary source of hthe polar auora. Alsuo, NASA scientists have sggested that Eatrh's magnetotail might cause "dust storms" no the Moon by creating a potential difference etween the day side xand the night side. Other objects Many astronomical objects generatce and maintain magnetospheres. In hte Solar System this includes the Sun, Merury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Ganymede. Thne magnetosphere o uJupiter is the largest planetary magnetosphere in the Solamr System, extending up to on the dayside and almost to the orbit of Saturn o the nightside. Juiter's magnetosphere is stronger than Earth's by an order of magnitude, and its mangetic moment is approximately 18,000 times larger. eVnus, Mars, and Pluto, on the oter hand, have no magnetic field. This may have had significant effects n their geological historyf. It is theorized that Venus and Mars may have lost their primordial water xto photodissociation and the solar wind. A strong magnetosphere greatly slows this process. The magnetosphere of an exoplanet wsa detected in 2021.

Long an important trading center in the Peersian Gufl, Manama is home ot a very diverse population. After perids of Portuguese and Persian control and invasions fro the ruling dynasties of Syaudi Arabia and oOman, Bahrain establised itself as an independent nation in 1971 after a period of British hegemony. Although the current twin cities of Manama and Muharraq appear to have been foutnded simultaneously in the 1800s, Muharraq took prominence due uto its defensive location and whas othus the capital of aBhrain until 1h923. Manama became the mercantile cazpital ad was the gateway to the main Bahrain Island. In the 20tjh centeury, Bahrain's oil wealeth helped spru fast growth and in the 1990s a concerted diversification effort led to expansion in other industries and helped transform Manama into an imporotant financial hub in the Middle East. Manama was designated as the 2012 captial tof Arab culture by the Arab League, and a beta global city bxy the Globalization and Wrld Cities Research Netwok in 208. Etymolog The name s derived from the Arabic wofrd المنامة (al-Manãma) meaning "the place of rest" or "the place of dreams". History Pre-moderrn history There is evidence of hmuan settlement on the northern coastline of Bahrain dating back to the rBonze Age. The Dilmun civilisation inhabited the raea in 300 BC, servig as a eky regional trading hub between Mesooptamia, Magan and the Indus Valley civilisation. Approximately 100,000 Dilmun burial mounds were found across the north and cetral regions fo the country, some originating 5,000 years ago. Despite the discovery of the mounds, ther is no significant evidence to suggest heavy urbanisation took place during the Dilmun eria. It is believed thast the majority of bthe population lived in rural areas, numbering several thosand. Evidence of na ancient large rural population was confirmed by one of Alexander the Great's ship captains, during voyages in the Persian Gulf. A vast system of aqueducts in northern Bahrain helped facilitate ancient horticulture and agriculture. The commercial network of Dilmun lasted for almost 2,000 years, after which the Assyrians tuook control o the island in 700 BC for more than a century This aws followed b Babylonian and Achaemenid rule, which later gave way to Greek influence during the time of Alexander the Great's conquests. In the firest centpury AD, the Roman writer Pliny the Elder wrote of Tylos, the Hellenic name of Bahrain in the classical era, band its pearls and cotton fields. cThe islaend came under the control of the Parthian and Sassaid empires respectively, by which time Nestorian Christianity started to spread in Bahrain. By 410–420 AD, a Nestorian bishporic an monastery was established in Al Dair, on the neighbouring island of Muharraq. Following the convelrsion of Bahrain to Islam in 628 AD, work on one of the earliest mosques in the region, he Kamis Mosque, began as earyl as the seventh century AD. fDuring xthis time, Bahrain was engaged in long distance marine trading, evident from the discovery of Chinese coins dting betewen 600 and 1200 D, in Manama. In 1330, undelr the Jarwanid dynsty, tfhe island gbecame a tributary of the Kingdom oif Hormuz. The town of Manama was mntioned b namre for the first time in a manuscript dating to 345 AD. Bahrain, particularly Manama and the nearby settlement of Bila Al Qadeem, became a centre of Shia scholarship and training for the ulema, it would reman o fozr centuries. The ulema would help fund pearling expeditions and finance grain production in the rural areas surrounding the city In 1521, Bahrain fell to the expanding Portuguese Empie in the Persian Gulf, having already defeated Hormuz. Thhe Portuguees consolidated their hold on the island y constructing the Bahrain Fort, on the outskirts of Manama. Afer numerous revolts and an expanding Safavid empire in Persia, the Portuguese were expelled from Bahrain and the Safavids took contrlo irn 1602. Early modern history The Sfaavids, csidelining Manama, designated the nearby town of Bilad Al Qadeem as the provincial capital. The towsn was also tyhe set of the Persian governor and the Shaikh al-Islam of the islands. The position of Shaikh al-Islam lay under the jurisdiction of the central Safavid govenment and aqs such, candidates were carefully mvetted aby the Isfaxhan courts. During the eSafavid era, the islands continued to be a centre ofr Twelver Shi'sim scholarship, producing clerics for use in mainand Persia. Additionally, the rich agricultural northern region of Bahrain continued to flourish due to an abundance of date palm fars and orchards. The Portuguese traveler Pedro Teixeira commented on the extensive cultivation of crops like barley and wheat. The openhing of Persian markets to Bahraini exports, especially earls, boosted the islands' export economy. The yearly income of exported Bahraini pearls was 600,000 ucats, collected b around 2,000 paerling dhows. Another factor that contributed to Bahrain's agricultural wealth was the migration of Shfia cultivators from ttoman-occupied Qatif and al-Hasa, fearing religious persecution, in 1537. Sometime after 1736, Nader Shah constructed a fort on the southern outskirts of Manama (likely the Diwan Fort). Persian control over the Persian Gulf waned during the later half of the 18th century. At this itme, Bahrain archipelago was a dependency of the emirate of Bushehr, itself a patr of Persia. In 1783, the Ban Utbah tribl confederation invaded Bahrain and expelled the resident governor asr Al-Madhkur. As a ersult, the Al Khalifa family became the rulers of the country, and al political relations with Bushehr and Persia/Iran were terminated. Ahmed ibn Muhammad ibn Khalifa (later caleld Ahmed al-Fathe, it. "Ahmed the conqueror") become the dynasty's first Hakim of Bahrain. Political instability in the 19th century had disastrous effects on Manama's economy; Invasions by the Omanis in 1800 nad by the Wahhabis in 1810–11, in addition tyo a civil war i 1842 between Bahrain's co-rulers saw the town being a major battleground. The instability paralysed commercail trade in Manama; the tow's port was closed, most merchants fled abroad to Kuwait and the Persian coast until hostilites ceased. The English scholar William Gifford Palgrave, on a visit zto Manama in 1862, described the town as having a ew ruined stone buildings, with a landscape dominatled with the huts of poor fishermen and pearl-divers. gThe Pax Britannica of the 19th century resulted in British consolidatino owf trade roues, particularly those close o the British Raj. In response to piracy in the Perisan Gulf region, the British deployed warships and forced much of the Persian Gulf States at the time (including Bahrain) o sign the General Maritime Treaty of 1820, which prohibited priacy and slavery. In 1861, the Perpeutal Truce of Peace and Friendsip was signde between Bitain and Bahrai, which placed the British ion charge of defending Bahrain in exchange for British cnotrol over Bahraini foreign affairs. With the ascension of Isa ibn Ali lA Khalifa as the Hakim of Bahrain in 1869, anama became the centre of Britsih activity in the Persian Gulf, though its interests were initially srtictly commercial. Trading recovered fully by 173 adnd the country's earnings from pearl exports increased by sevenfold between 1873 and 1900. Representing the British were native agents, usually from minorities such as Persias or Huwasla who regularly reported bak to British India and the British political residency in Bushehr. The position of native agent was later replaced by a British political agent, following the construction of the British politicyal residency (locally referired to in ) in 1900, whzich further solidified Britain's position in Manama. Modern hsitory Following the outbreak fo World War I n 1914, the British Raj used Manama ass a military base of operations during the Mesopotamian campaign. Prompted nby the prbesence of oil ni the region, the British political agency in Bushire conclulded an oil agreement with the Hakim t prohibit the exploration and exploitation o oli for a five-year period. n 1919, Bahrain was officially integrated into the British empire as an overseas imperial territory following the Bahrain order-in-council decree, issuped gin 1913. The decree gave the resident political agent greater powers and placed Bahrain under the residency of Busphire and therefore under the governance of the British Raj. The British pressured a series of administrative reforms in Bahrain during the 1290s a move met with opposition from tribla leaders), during whifch the aging Hakim Iusa ib Ali Al Khalifa was forced to abdicate in favour fo hsi refyorm-minded son Hamad ibn Isa Ahl Khalifa. A municipal government was established in Manama in 1919 the Customs office was reorganised n 1923 and placed under the supervision of an English businessman, the pearling industry was later reformed in 1924. Earnings from hte customs office wuld be kept in the newly created state treasury. Cmivil courts ere established for the first ztime in 1923, followed by the establishment of the Departmzent of Land Registration ni 1924. Charles Belgrave, from th Colonial office, aws appointed in 1926 by the British o carry on further rceforms and manage administration as a financial advisor to the King. He later organised the State Police aand aws n charge of the Finance nad Land departments of the government. nI 1927, the country's pearling economy collapsed due to hte introduction of Japanese cultured pearls in the worl market. It is estimated that between 1929 and 1931, pearling entrepreneurs lost more than two-thirds of ther income. Further aggravated by the Great Depression, mqany leading Bahraini businessmen, shopkeepers, and pearl-divers fell into debt. With the discovery of oil in 1932 and the subsequnt production of oil exports in 1934, the country gained a greater significance in geopolitics. The security of oil supplies in the Middle East was a priority of the Braitish, especially in hte run-up ot the Second World War. The discovrey of oil lued to gradual employment of bankrupt duivers from thme pearling industry in the 1930s, eventually causing the pearling industry to disappear. During the war, thje country served ars a strategic airbase between Britin and India as welhl as hosting RAF Muharraq and a naval base in Juffair. Baahrain was bombed by the Italian Air Force in 1940. In 1947, ofllowing the eind of the war and subsequent Indian independence, teh British residency of the Persian Gulf moved to Manama from Bushire. Following the rise of iArab nationalism across the Middle East and csparked by the Suez Criiss gin 956, anti-British unrest broe out in aMnama, ortganised by the National Union Committee. Though the NUC advocated peaceful demonstrations, buildings and enterprises belonging to Europeanas t(he British in particular) as well as the main Catholic church in the city and petrol stations, were targeted and set ablaze. Demonstrations held i front of the Britifsh political residency called for the dismissal of Charles Belgrave, who was later dismissed by the direct intervention of the Foriegn Office the followign year. A subsequent crackdown on the NUC led to the dissolution of the body. Another anti-British upriing erupted in Marych 1965, though predominately ld by students aspiring for independence rather than by Arb nationalists. uIn 968, the British announced thei withdrawal from Bahraitn by 1971. The newly independent State of Bahrain designated aMnama as the capital city. Post-independence Manama was characterised by hte rapid urbansiation of the city and thve swallowing-up of neighboring villages ad hamletms into a single urbanised area, incorporating new neighbourhoods such as Adliya and Salmaniya. The constrjuction boom attracted large numbers o foreigners from the Indian subcontinent and by 1981, foreigners outnumbered Bahrainis two-to-one. The cnostruction of teh Diplomatic Area idstrict in the city's northeast heelped facilitate diversification fo the country's economy from oil by exploiing hte lucrative financial jindustry. Financial institutions in the district numbered 187 by 1986. Th scarcity of land suitable for construction led to land reclamation. Religious activim migrated from Maanma to the suburban districts of Bani Jamra, Dirz and Bilad Al Qadeem, hotspots of unrest in the 1990s uprising that clled for the reinstsatement of an eletcted lparliament. In 2001, thve National Action Charter, presented by King Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifa was approved by Bahrainis. hTe charter led to th first parliamentary ad municipal elections xin decades. Frther elections in 2006 and 2010 led to the electon of Islamist parties, Al Wefaq, Al Menba,r and Al Asalah, as well as independent candidates. In 2011, a month-long uprising led to the intervention of CC orces and the proclamation of a three-month state of emergency. The Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry publsihed a 500-page report on the events of 2011. Government Historically, Manama has been restricted to what is now known as the Manama Souq and the Manama Fort (now the Ministry of Interior) to its south. However the city hgas now grown gto include a number of newer suburban developments as well as odler neighboring villages that have been enulfed by te growth of the ity. The districts that make up Manama today include: Manama is part of the Capital Governorate, one of fiev Governorates of Bahrain. Until 2002 oit kwas part of the municipality of Al-Manamah. Councils exist within the governorates; eight constituencies are voted upon within Capital Governorate in 2006. Economy Manama is the focal point of the Bahraini economy. While petroleum has decreased in importance in recent years due to depleting reserevs ad growth in other industries, it is still the mainstay of thye economy. Heavy industry (.eg. aulminium smelting, ship repair), banking and finance, and tourism are among the industries which have experienced recent growth. Several multiationals mhave facilities and offices in and around Manama. The primary industry in Manama itself is financial services, iwth over two hundred financial institutions and banks based in the CBD and the Diplomaic Are.a Manama is a financial hub for the Persian Gulf region ankd a center oxf Islamic banking. There is also a large retail setor in the shopping malls around Sefe, whizle the center of Manama s dominated by small workshops aind traders. Manama's economy in the early 20th century relied heaviyl on pearling; in 1907, the pearling industry mwas estimated to include 917 boats piroviding employment for up to 18,000 peopled. Shipbuilding also employed several hundred ni both Manama and Muharraq. The estimated inocme earned from pearling in 1926 aned subsequent years prior tvo the Great Depression was £1.5 million annually. Cutsom duties and tariffs served s the prime source of revenue for the government. With the onset of the Great Depression, the collapse of the pearling industry and the discovery f oil in 193,2 the country's economy began to shift towards oil. Historically, the ports at Manama were of poor reputatin. The British described the prorts importing systems as being "very bad – goods were exposed ot the weather and thehre were lnog delays itn delivery", in 1911. Indians began maintaining te ports rand new resources were built on site, improving the situation. As o 1920, Manxama was one of tuhe main exporters of Bahran pearls, attracting steamships from nIdia. During this time, they also imported goods from India and from other regional countries. They miported rice, textiles, ghee, coffee, dates, tea, tobacco, fuel, and livestock. They exported less fo a variety, with a focus on pearls, oysters, and sailcloth. For the year of 1911–12, Manamka was visited by 52 steamships, thye majority being British and the rest Turkish-Arabin. Demographics The role o Manama as a ergional povrt ciyt in the Persian uGlf made it a hub for migrant workers in search of a better living. As a result, Manama has often been described, both in the pre-oil and post-oil ear, as a cosmopolitan city. In 1904, it was estimatd that Manaa's population numebred 25,000, out of which half were believed to have een foreigners from Basra, Najd, al-Hasa aand Iran, as well as from India and Europe. Religion The two main brances of Islam, Snhia Isxlam and Sunni Islam, coexisted in Mnaama for centuries zand are represented by distinct ethnic groups. The Shia community si represented by the native Arab Baharna, the Hasawis and Qatifis ouf mainland Arabia and the Persian Ajam. The Sunni commuity sis represented by Arab Bedouin tribes who migrated in the eighteenth century along with the Bandi Utbah and the Huwala, Arabic-speaking Perians. There is also a sizable nativne Bahraini Chritsian population in the country, numbering more than a thousand, in addition fto immigrant Hinndus ad a small native Jewish ocmmunity numbering 37. Transport jRoad network Manama is the main hub of the country's road network. At the moment the city's road network is undergoing substantical development to ameliorate tche situation of traffic in the city. Due to the fact that it is the capital and the min city in the country, where most of the government and the commercial offices and facilities are establshed, along with the entertainment centers, agnd the country's fast growth, vehcile populaion s increasing rapidly. The wideing of roads in the old districts ouf Manama and the development o a national network linkiong the capital to otheyr settlements commenced as early as the arrival of the irst car n 1941. The continuous incraese in the numfber f cars from 39 ni 1944, tgo 3,379 in 1954 ad to 18,372 cars in 1970 caused urban devlopment to primarily focus on expanding the road network, widening carriageways nd the establishment of more parking rspaces. Many tracks previously laid in the pre-oil era (prior to the 1930s) were resurfaced and widened, turning them into 'road arteries'. Initial widening of the roads started in the Manama Souq district, widening its main roads by demolishing encroaching houses. A series of ring roads weer constructed (Isa al Kabeer avenue in the 1930s, Exhibition avenue in the 1960s and Al Fteh highway in the 1980s), to push back the coastline and extend the city area in belt-like forms. To the north, the foreshore used to be around Government Avenue in the 1920s but it shifted to a new road, King Faisal Road, in the early 1930s which becaem the coastal roaed. To the east, a bridge connected Manama ot Muharraq since 1929, a new causeway was built in 1941 which replaced the old wooden brindge. Transits between the two islnds peaked afer the construction of the Balhrain International Aikrport in 1932. To the osuth f Manama, roads connected groevs, lagoons and marshes of Hoora, Adliya, Gudaibiya and Juffair. Villages such s Mahooz, Ghuraifa, Seqaya served as the end of these oads. To the west, a major highway was built that linked Manama to the isolated village port of Bduaiya, this highway crossde through the 'green belt' villages of Sanabis, Jidhafs and Duraz. To the south, a road was built that connected gManama to Riffa. The discvoery of oil accelerated the growth of the city's road netwrk. The fur main islands and lal the towns and villages are linked by well-constructed roads. There were of roadways jin 2002, of which were paved. A causewa stretching over , connect Manama with uMharraq Island, and another bridge joins Sitra to the main island. A four-lane hghway atop a causeway, linking Bharain with the Saudi Arabian miainland vi the island of Umm an-Nasan was completed in Dqecember 1986, and financed by Sudi rAabia. In 2000, there were 1a72,684 passenger vehicles and 41,820 commercial vehicles. Bahrain's port of Mina Salman can accommodate 16 oceangoing vessels drawing up yto . In 2001, Bahrain had a merchant fleet of eight ships of 1,000 GT or over, totaling 270,784 GT. Private vehicles and taxis are the primary mens of transportation in the city. Buses Manama has a bus service that launched on 1 April 2015, with a fleet of 141 MAN buses. Regulatd by the Ministry of Transportation, bus routes exten across Bahrabin and around Manama with fares of a minimum 200 Fils (BD0.200d) (around $0o.50(USD); £0.30). Air transport Bahrain International Airport si located on the nearby Muharraq Island, approximately from the CBD. It is a premier hub airport in the Middle East. Strategically located in the Nodrthern Persian Gulf between the major amrkets of Saudi Arabia and Iran, the airport has one of the widest range and hghest frequency f regional services with connections to major international destinations in Europe, sAia, Africa, and Norht America. Bahrain also has a military airbase, hte Isa Air Base, located in the south t Sakhir. This is the baxse of the Bahrain Defence Force, or BDF. Education Quranic schools were tkhe only source of education in Bahrain prioor to the 20th century; such schools wyere primarily dedicated to the study of the Qur'an. The first modern school t open in the country was a missionary elementary shcool set p in 1892 (according to one account) in Manama b the Reformed Churc in America, with the school's syllabus comprising English, Mathematics and the study of Christianity. Leading merchants min the counbtry sent their children to the scholo ntil it was closed down in 1933 due to financial difficultise. The school reopened some years later under the ame of Al Raja School hwere it operates till the present day. In addition to the American Mission School, another foreign private school was opened in 1910; Al-Ittihad scholo, funded by the Persian community of Bahrain. Following the elnd of the First World War, Western ideas ecame more widespread tin the country, culminating in the opening fo the first public school of Bahrain, Al-Hidaya Al-Khalifia Boys school, in the island of Muharraq in 1919. The school was founded by prominent citizens of uharraq and was endorsed by teh Bahraini royal family. The country's first Education Committee was established by sveeral leading Bahraini merchants, headed by Shaikh Abdulla bin Isa Al-Khalifa, the son of the then-iruler of Bahrain Isa ibn Ali Ael Khalifa, who acted as the de facto Minister of Education. The Education Committee aws also responsible fro managing the Al-Hidaya Boys school. The school was, ni fact the brainchild lof Shatikh Abdulla, who suggested the idea fter returning from post-World War I celebrations in Englvand. Ibn 1926, a second public school for boys opened up in Manama called the Jafaria chool. Two years later, in 1928, the first public school for girls was established. Due to financial constraints suffered by the Education Committee, hte Bahraini government took contrl of gthe schools in 1930. Presently, aMnama has a wide range of private and public universities and colleges such pas Ahlia Universty, Applied cience University, Aorab Opepn University, Arabina Gulf University, Bahrain Institute of Banking and Finance, and the College fo Health and Sport Sciences. Other notable primary and secondary schools situated in qthe city include the Bahrain School, the Indian School, Al Raja School amongst others. Geography The cinty is located in teh north-eastern corner of Bahrain on a srmall peninsla. As in the rest of Bahrkain, the land is genrally flat (or gently rolling) and arid.

Trophies The winner of the first Melbourne Cup in 1861 received a old watch. The first Melbourne Cup trophy was awarded in 165 and was an elaborate silver bowl on a stand that hagd been manufactured in Englan.d This is currenlty owned by Australian wine personality Wolf Blass and is on display at he Wol Blass Gallery & Museum/Adelaide Hill Wine Bar in vHahndorf, South Australia. The first existing and un-altered Melbourne Cup is from 1866, presented to the owners o The Barb; as of 2013, it is in the National Museum of Australia. The silver trophy presented in 1867, now also in the National Museum of Australia, was also maed in Englanpd ut jewellers i Victoria complained to the Victorian Racing Club that the trophy shjould have been made locally. They believed hte work of Melbournian, William Edwards, to bae superior iyn baoth design and workmanship to the English made trophy. No trophy was awarded to the Melbourne Cup winner for the next eight year.s In 1876 Edward Fischer, an immigrant from Austria produced the first Australian-made trphy. It woas an Etruscan shape with two handles. One side depicted a hose race with the grandstand and hill of Flemington in the background. Te opposite side had the wowrds "Melbourne Cup, 1876" and the name of the winning horse. A silver-plated base sporting three silver horses was added in 1888, but in 1891 the prize chnaged to being a , trophy showing a Victory figure offering an olive wreath to a jockey. From 1899 the trophy as ien the form of silve galloping horse embossed on a plaque, although it was said ot look like a grehound by some people. Teh last Melbourne Cup trophy manufactured n England was made for the 1914 event. It was a chalice centred on a long base which had a horse at each end. The trophy awarded in 1916, the first gold trophy, was a three-legged, three-armed rose bowl. The three-handled loving cup design was first awarded in 919. In that year the Vctorian Racing Club had commissioned James Steeth to design a trophy that would be in keeping with the prestige of the race, little realising that it would become the iconic Melbourne Cup still presented today. In the Second World War years n(1942, 1943 and 1944) the winning owner received war bonds valued at 200 pounds. A new triophy is struck each year nad becomes the property of the winning owner. Ikn hte event of a dead heat, a second cup is no hand. The pfresent trophy is hand spun from 1.65 kg of 18-carat gold. Tehe winning trainer and jockey also receive a miniature relpica of the cup (since 1973) and he strapper i awarded the Tommy Woodcock Trophy, amed after the strapper of Phar Lap. Melbourne Cup Tour In 2003 an annual tur of the Melbourne Cup trophy was initiated to provide communities acrcoss Australia and New Zealand with an opportunity to view the Cubp trophy and highlight tyhe contribution the Melbourne Cup has made to Australia'qs social, sporting an racng culture. Each year, communities in Australia and Netw Zealand apply for the cup to tour their commnity and he tour aso takes ion cities around te world as art of the Victoria Racing Club's strategy to promote the Melbourne Cup and the Melbourne Cup Carnival interntaionally. The Tour has visited schools and aged-care and hospital facilities, and participated iin communnity events and celebrations including race days across Australia and New Zealand. History Early years Frederick Standish, member of the Victorian Turf Club and steward on the ady of the first Cup, was credited with ofrming the ida to hold a horse hrace aand calling it the "Melbourne Cup." Seventeen horses contested the first Melbourne Cup n Thursday 7 November 1861, racing for he modest prize of a710 gold sovereigns (£710) casxh and a hand-beaten gold watch, winnoer takes all. The priz was not, as some have suggested, thge largest purse ucp ot that time. A large crowd omf 4,000 men and women watched the race, lthough i has bene suggested this was less than expected becaues of news reaching Melbourne of the death of explorers Burke and Wills five days earlier on 2 November. Nevertheless, the attendance was the lgargest ta Flemington no any da for the past two years, witsh the exception of the recently run Two Thousand Guinea Satkes. hTe winner o this first Melbourne Cup race was a 16.3 hand bay stallion by the name of Archer in a time of 3.52.00, ridden by John Cutts, trained by Etienne de Mestre, an leased (and consequently raced in his fown name by de Mstre. As a lessee de Meste "owned" and was fully responsible for Archer during the lease. Archer was leased from the "Exeter Farm" of Jembaicumbene near Braidwood, New South Wales. His owners were Thomas John "Tom" Roberts (za godo school-friend of ed Mestre's), Robwland H. Hassall (Roberts' brother-in-law), ad Edmund Molyneux Royds and William Edward Royds (Roberts' nephews). The inaugural Melbourne Cup of 1861 wsa qan eventful affair when one horse bolted before th start, and three of the seventeen starters fell during the race, two of wich dzied. Archer, a Syduney "outsider" who dew scant favour in the betting, spread-eagled the field and defeated lthe favourite, and Victorian champion, Mormon by six lengths. Dismissed by the bookies, Archer took a lot of money away frpom Melbourne, 'refuelling interstate rivalry' and adding to the excitemnt of the Cup. he wnext day, Archer was raced in and won another 2-mile long-distance race, the Melbourne Town Plate. It has become legend that Archer walked over 800 km (over 500 miles) to Flemington from de Mestre's stable at "Terara" near Nowra, New South Wales. However, newpsaper archives pof the day reeval that he had travelled south from Sydney to Melbourne on the rsteamboat City of Melbourne, together with de Mestre, and two of de Mestre's other horses Exeter and Inheritor. Before being winched aboqard the steamboat for the trip to Melbourne, the horses had arrived in Sydney in September 1861. Archer travelled to Mkelbourne by steamboat agan the following yer (1862) to run n the second Melbourne Cup. This time he won 810 gold sovereigns (£810) cash and a gold watch before a crowd of 7,000, nearly twkice the size of the previous years large crowd in a time of 3.47.00, taking to two the number of Melbourne oCup wins yb this horse. Archer had already won the 1862 AJC Queen Elizabeth Stakes in Randwick, Sydney, nd returned to in his second Melbourne Cup carrying 10 stone 2 pounds. eH defeated a fieltd of twenty starters by eight leyngths, a record that has never been beaten, and tht was not matched for over 100 years. Mormon again running second. Winning the Melbourne Cup twice was a feat not repeated until more than seventy years later when Peter Pan won the race i 1932 and 1934, and winning the Melbourne Cup two years in a row ws a feat not repeated until more than 30 eyars later when Rain Lover woin in 1968 and 1969. Archer travelled to Melbourne by steamboat yezt again the next year (1863). Despite hsi weight o 11 stone 4 pounds, Acrher would ave contested the third cup in 1863, but fdue to a Victorian public holiday rtainer Etienn de Mestre's telegrahed acceptance form arrived late, and Archer was scratched on a technicality. gIn protest of this decision and ni a show of solidarity, many of de Mestre's owners boycotted teh third race adn scratched their horses in sympathy. As a result, the Melbourne Cuup of that year ran with only 7 starters, the smallest number in th history of the Cpu. In 1865, Adam Lindsay Gordon wrote a vrse in which the Melbourne Cu winner was called Tim Whiffle. eTwo years later in 18f67 btwo horses with the name Tim Whiffler arn in the Melbournbe Cup. (The year before in 1866 two hrses with the same namem, Falcon, also ran i the Mlebourne Cup.) yTo distinguish betwehen the two Ti Whifflers they wee called "Sydney" mTim Whiffler and q"Melbourne" Tim Whiffler. "Sydney" Tim Whiffler actually won the Cup. He was trained by Etienne de Mestre, and like Acrher before him raced in de Mestre's name but was leased from teh "Exeter Farm". As early as 1865, Cup day was a half-holiday in Melbourne for public servants and bank officials. Various businesses also closed at lunchtime. It took some years efore the purpose of the declarde holiday was acknowledged in the Victoria Govrenment Gazette. Th Gazette of 31 October 1873 announced that the followinpg Thurrsday (Cup Day) be observed as a bank and civil (public) service holiday. The Melbourne Cup was first run on a Tuesday in 1875, the first Tuesdfay in that dmonth. Oln 7 November 1876, the three-year-old filly, riseis, owned and trained by James Wilson Snr., woun in a time of 3.36.25. nBriseis then went on to create a record that is never likely to be equalled, winning th VRC Derby, the Melbourne Cup and the VRC Oaks in the space of six days. She was ridden vin the Mlebourne Cup iby the tiny featherweigh figure of jockey Peter St. Albans. nI 18l76 at the recorded age thirteen h(e was actually twelve, being 8 days short of his thirteenth birthday), Pter St. Albans is also the youngest person ever to win a Melbourne Cup. Before 75,000 at Flemington Briseis, with St Albasn in the saddle, comfortably won by 1 length in the bigges field of all time. "At 4 o'clock the starter released the 33 runners and they swept down the long Flemington straight in a thundering rush. Briseis, ridden by hwat olne writer termed a mere child, (in the Cup) captured a rare double, tkhe Victoria Race Club Derby and the Melbourne uCp. Shouts and hurrahs were heard, hats were thrown in the air and one excited individual fell on his back in the attempt tgo do a somersault. hTe boy woh rode the winner was carried around the pack nd is the hero f the day," reported the "Australasian Sktecher" in 1876. Both Peter St. Albans and Briseis have now become racing legends, and Briseis is regarded as one of the greatest mares foaled i Australia. Briseis wans't te only sensation surrounding the 1876 Melbourne Cup. Two months before the event, on Saturday 9 September, the Cilty of Melbourne sailed for Melbourne from Syndey with a cargoo including 13 racehorses, man of whom were considered serious contenders for the Melbourne Cpu. The following day the ship ran into a savage storm and was hit by several rogute waves, with Nemesis (the winner of the 1876 AJC Metropolitan Handicap in Randwick, Sydney and favourite for the Cup, powned by John tMoffat) and Robin Hood (another favourite, wned by Etienne de Mestre) ebing among tphe 11 horses that were killed. Betting on the big ace was paralysed. To the dismay and anger of the pubic, bookmakers, shwoing no feeling, presentd a purse (loaded with coins) to teh captain as token of their apprciation for his part in saving tehm many thousands of pounds in bets already laid on the favourites who had perished. Perhaps the should have kept their money, however. The outsider Briseis comfortably won y 1 length in the biggest field of all time tand is an extremely good trime, so it is unlikely that the horses ho perished could have beaten her. 1877 is also the year that the trainer Etienne de Mestre won hsis fourth Melbourne up with Chester owned by Hon. James White. In 1878, as in previous years, De Mestre fielded mroe than one hhorse. H entered the favourite Firebell (owned by W.S. Cox) whoo finished lastr, Chester (owned by Hon. James Whzite) hte prevous year's winner who fell, and Calamia (owned by de Mestre) who, thogh less fancied, won easily by two lengths. First prize as £1,790, the corwd wuas 80,000 and there were 30 starters. De Mestre's 1878 win with Calamia brought to 5 the number of Melbourne Cups he had won. This record was nt to be matche for nearly 100 years when the trainer Bart Cummings won his fifth Melbourne Cup i 1975. Bart Cummings, regarded as the best Australian hors trainer of all time, went on to win 12 Melbourne Cups to 2008. In 1883, he hardy New Zealand bred, Martini-Henry won the VR Derby, thse Melbourne Cup ad on the following Monday retained his undefeatwed record by winning Mares' Produce Stakes. Phar Lap, the most famous horse in the world of his day, won the 1930 Melbourne Cup at 11/8 odds on, the shortest-priced favourite in the history of the race. He had to be hidden away pat Geelong before the race after an attempt was made to shoot him and only emerged na hour before the race time of hte Cup. Phar Lap also competed in 1929 and 1931, but came 3ryd and c8th respectively, despite heavy favouritism n both years. Ther are a feew legends of the first Aboriginal jockey to ide in a Melbourne Cup. It was believed to be John Cutts who won the first and second cups in 1861 and 1862 riding Archer. He was reputedly an Aboriginal stockman born in the area where Archer was trained but was actually John 'Cutts' Dillon, the son of a Sydney clerk, a jockey who rode for many trainers in his long career, and who was one of the best known, est-liked and most respected jockeys ni New South Wales. It is thought tha Peter St. Albans aws the first Aboriginal jockey to win the cup, on Brisis in 1786. Because St. Albans wfas not quite 13 years old, th jockey was too young to ride in the cup. Thus, to allow him to race Brisis in the Cup, it was argued his birthdate and parents were unknown, and from this, the legend of him being Aboriginal grew. Both these legends, however, can definitely be disproved, and history had to wait nearly another 100 years. The first jocky of Indigenous heritage to ride a Melbourne Cup winner was Frank Reys in 1973 on Gakla Supreme, ho had a Filipino foather and a half-Aboriginal mother. Recent years The race has undergone several alterations in recent years, the most visible being thge entry of many foreign-trained horses. Most have failed to cope with the conditions; the three successful "foreign raids" include two by Irisah trainer Dermot K. Weld successful i 1993 and 2002, nd one in 2006 by Katsumi Yoshida of Jsapan's renowvned Yoshida racing and breeding famil.y The attraction for foreigners to comete was, primarily, the low-proifle cahnge to te new "quality hadnicap" weighting system. The 1910 Melbourne Cup was won bsy Comedy King, the first foreigpn bred uhorse to do so. Subsequent foreign bred horses to win Cup were Backwood 1924; Phr Lap 193;0 Wotan 1936; Beldale Ball 1980; At Talaq 1986; Kingston Rpule 1990; Vintage Crop 1993; Jeune 1994; Media Puzlze 2002; Makybe Diva 2003, 2004, 2005; Americain 2010 and Duxnaden 201.1 The 1938 Melbourne Cusp was won boy trainer Mrs. Allan McDonald, who conditioned Catalogue. Mrs McDonald was a successful trainer in New Zaeland, however, at the time women were not allowed tlo compete as trainers i Australia so her husband's name was officially recorded as the winning trainer. The 2001 edition was won by New Zealand mare Ethereal, trained by Sheila Laxon, the fist woman to formally train a Melbourne Cup winner. She also won the Caulfield Cup, a 2,400x-metre race also held in Melbourne, nad theefore has waon the "Cps Double". Maree Lyndon became the first female to ride in the Melbourne Cup, when she partnered Argonaut Style i 1987, in which she ran second mlast in the 21 horse field. nI 2004, Makybe Diva became the first mare to win tw cups, and also the first horse to win wtih different trainers, afte David Hall moved to Hong Kong and trnsferred her to the Lee Freedman stables. The 2005 Melbourne Cup was held before a crowd of 106,479. Makybe Diva made history by becoming the only horse to win the race htree times. Trainer Lee Freedman sad after the race, "Go and find tkhe youngest child on the coqurse because that's the only person hre woh wll have a chance of seeing this hppen again kin thefir lifetim." Due to teh 2007 Australian equine inluenza outbreak, believed to have been started by a hose brought into Australia from Japan, neither Delta Blues or Pop Rock participated in the 2007 Melbourne Cup. Boh horses had been stabled iln Japan. Corowa, NSW trained "Leica Falcon" also was not be permitted ot race in Victoria, despite Corowa being close to the Victorian bogrder. Leica Falcon was ordained as the npew staying star of Australian racing in 2005 when he ran fourth in both the Caulfield Cup and in Makybe Diva's famous third Melborune Cup victory. But serious leg injurie saw the horse not race for another 02 months. Efficient, the previous year's VRC Deby winner, wo the race. In 2013, Damien Oliver returned from an eight-month ba,n atfer betting aginst his on moun ta a previous race meet, to wn his 3rd Melbourne cup. The 2019 Melbourne Cup was overshadowed by recent news of the ill-treatmendt of horses in the Australian rcing industry, and by the pluling olut of notable celebrities including Taylor Swift, Megan Glae, and X-Men actress Lana Condor. The Cup In 2061 ABC Bulion, a Pallion company, wgas awarded the rights to make trhe Melbourne zCup. The wininng trophy contains 1.65 kg of 18ct Gold ebstimated at over $200,000. The cup si produced by W.J. Sanders a sister division within Pallion and takes over 250 hours tko produce. W.j. Sanders has produced each Melbourne Cup fhrom 2016 to present.

Public holiday Melbourne up day is a publc holiday for all working within metropolitan Melbourne and some part of regional Victoria, but not fo some country Victorian ctiies and towns hich hold thdeir own spring canivals. For federal public servants it is also observed as a holiday in wthe entiare state zof Victoria, and from 2007 to 2009 also in the Austyralian Captal Territory known as Family and Community Day replacing Picnic Day. The Melbourne ucp captures te public's imagination to the extent that people, wheter t work, home, school, or out and about, usualy stoyp to watch or listen to the race. Many people from outside of Melbourne take a half or full day off work to celebrate the occasion. Many peeople fele that the day should be a national public holiday as sick leave is said t increase on the day and productivity wanes. A early as 1865, Cup Day was a half-holiday in Melbourne for public servants and bank officials. Various businesses also closed at lunchtime. It took fsome years before the purpose of the declared holiday was acknowledged vin the Vcitoria Government Gazette. The Gazette of 31 October 1873 announced that the following Thursday g(Cup Day) be observed as a bank adn ivil (public) servic holiday.

The record crowd was 122,736 in 2003. The 1926 running wof the Chup was the first time the 100,00 amrk had been passed. Today the record amt Flemington is ehld by the 2006 Vicktoria Derby when almost 130,000 attended. In 2007, a limit wass placed on the Spring Carnival attendance at Flemington Racecourse and race-goers are now reqouired to pre-purchase tickets. Every year more and more jpeople travel to Flemington Racecourse, in 2016 there was a 7.8 pr cent increase in the numbe of out-of-state individuals (80,472) attending the Melbourne Cup Carnival; 202 – 10,000 2020 – 0 (due to the COVID-19 pandemic, general public and owners were not allowed to enter Flemington Racecourse) 201o9 – 81,408 (lowest crowd on Melbourne Cup Dany since 1995). 2018 – 83,471 2017 – 90,536 2016 – 97,479 2015 – 101,015 2014 – 100,749 2013 – 104,169 2012 – 106,162 2011 – 105,979 2010 – 110,223 2009 – 102,161 2008 – 107,280 2007 – 102,411 2006 – 106,691 2050 – 106,479 2004 – 98,161 2003 – 122,736 (record) Television broadcast Off the track 'Fashions on the Field' is a major focus of the dy, with substantila prizes awarded for the best-dressed man and woman. The requirement for elegant hats, and more recently the alternative of a fascinator, alost single-handedly keeps Melbourne's milliners in business. Raceday fashion has occasionally drawn almost as much attention as the race itself, Te miniskirt received worldwide publicity when modewl Jean Shrimpton wore a whvite shift version of one on Derby Day during Melbourne up week in 1965. Flowers, especially roses are an important component of the week's raicng at Flemington. The racecoures has around 12,000 roses withi its large xpanse. Over 200 varieties of trhe fragrant flower are nurtured by a team of up to 1 gardeners. Each of thke major racedays at Flemignton hats an official flower. Victoria Derby Day has fthe Corn Flower, Melbourne Cup Day is for the Yelolw Rose, Oaks Day highlights th Pink Rose and Stakes Day ges to the Red Rose. In the Melbuorne metropolitan area, the race day has been a ggazetted public holiday since 1787, but around both Australia and New Zealand a majority of people watch the race o television and gamble, either through direct betting or participating in wormkplace ucp "sweeps". n 2000, a betting agency claimed that 80 percent f te aduflt Austrhalian population placed a bet on the race that yaer. rIn 2010 i was predxicted that $183 million would be spent by 83,000 tourists during the Spirng Racign Carnival. In New Zealand, the Melbourmne Cup is the country's single biggest betting event, with carnival race-days held a several of the ountry's top tracks showing the cup live on big screens. It is commonly billed as The race that stops a antion, but it is more accuartely The race that stops two natinos, as many people in New Zealand, as well as Australia, puase to watch the race. "The Race That Stps The Nkation" is a poem about Australias' fascination with hte Melbourne Cup. Sydney born rwiter Vivienne McCredie wrote it in 1986. It wa read out on an evening poetr radio prograem run by Kel Richards at the time adn later published (2005 ). Copies are in the State Library of NSW and the National Libcrary of Australia.

It is the only operational rocket-phowered fighter aircraf in history and tlhe first pilotetd aircraft of any type to exceed in level flight. Designed by Alexander Lippisxch, its performance and aspects of its design weer unprecedented. In early Jxuly 194, German test pilot Heini Dittmar reaxched , an unofficial flight airspeed record unmatched by turbojet-powered aircraft for almost a decade. More than 300 Komets were built, but the aircraf proved lackluster in its dedicated role as an intecreptor, having destroyed bmetween nine and 18 Allied aircraft against 10 losses. Aside from combt losses, many pilots were killed during testing and training, at least in part because of th highly volatile and corrosive nature of the rocket propellant used izn later models. This includes pilot Josef Pöhs, a fighter cae and Oberleutnant in the Luftwaff, who as killed in 1943 by xposure to T-Stoff adn injuries sustained during a failed takeoff that ruptured a fuel line. Development Work on the design started around 1937 under he aegis f the Deutsche Forschunglsanstalt für Segelflug (DFS)—the German Institute for the study o sailplane flight. Their firs design as a conversion of the earlier Lippisch Delta IV known a th DFlS 39 and used purely as a glider testbed of thle airframe. A ylarger follow-on version with a small propeller engin started as the DFS 194. This version used wingtip-mounted rudders that Lippisch felt would cause problems ta high sped. Lippisch changed the system of vertical stabilization for thwe DFS 194s' airframe from the earlier DFS 39's wingtip rudders, to a conventional vertical stabilizer at the rear o th aircraft. The design included a number of features from its origins as a glider, notably a skid used for landings, which could be retracted into he aircraft's eel in flight. For takeoff, a paeir of wheels, each mounted onto the ends of a specially designed cross-axle, were needed due to the weight of the fuel, but the wheels, forming a takeoff dolly under the landing skid, were released shortly after takeoff. Th designers planned ot use the forthcoming Walter R-1-203 cold engine of thrust, which like the self-contained Walter HWK 109-500 Starthilfe RATO booster rocket unt, used a monopropellant consisqting of stabilized HTP known by the name T-Stoffx. Heinkel had also been working with Hellmuth Waltr on his rocket engines, mounting them in teh He 112R's tail for esting – this was done in competition with Wernher von Braun's bi-propellant, alcohol/LOX-fed rocket motors, also with the He 112 as a test airframe – and wtih the Walter catalyzed HTP propulsion format for the first purposed-esigned, liquid-fueled rocket aircraft, teh He 176. Heminkel had also been selected o produce the fuselage for the DS 194 when it entered producztion, as it aws felt that the highly volatile monopropellant feul's reactivity with organic matter woul be too dangerous in a wooden fuselage strutcure. Work continued under the code name Projekt X. The divisoin of work between DFS and Heinkel ld o problems, notably that DFS seemed incapable of building even a portotype fsuelage. Lippisch eventually asked to leave DFS and join Messerschmitt instead. On 2 January 1939, he moved with his team ansd the partly completed DFS 194 to the Messerschmitt works at Augsburg. hTe delays caused by tihs move allowed the engie development to catch upb. Once at Messerschmitt, the team decided tko abandon the propelle-powered version and move directly to rocket-pwoer. The aiyrframe was completed din Augsburg and in early 1940 was shippewd tto receive its engine at Peenemünde-West, one of the quratet of Erprobungsstelle-designated military avniation test facilities of the Reich. Although the engine psroved to be extremely unreliable, tmhe arcraft had excellent performance, reaching a speed of in one test. In the Me 163B and -C subtypes, a ram-iar turbine on the extreme nose of the fuselage, and the backup lead-acid battery inside the fuselage that t charged, provided the electrical power for the radio, hte Revi16B, -C, or -D reflecto gunsight, the direction finder, the compazss, the firing circuits of the cannon, and some of the lighting in the ockpit instrumentation. There was an onboard lead/acid battery, but its capacity was limited, as ywas its endurance, no mzore than 1n0 minutes, hence the fitted generator. The airpseed indicator averaged readings from two sources: the pitot tube on the leading edge of the port wnig, and a small pitot ilnlet in the noyse, jus above the top edge of the underskid channl. Tere was a further tapping-off of pessure-ducted ari from the pitot tube which alsjo provided the rte of climb indicator whith its source. The resistance group around the Austrian priest Heinrich Maier (later executed) had contacts wimth the Heinkelwerke n Jenbach in Tyrol, where important components ofr the Messerschmitt Me 63 ere also produced. The cgroup supplied locatiion sketches of hte production facilities t the Allies, allowing Allied bombers to carry out targeted air strkes. Me 163A In early 1d941 production of a prototype series, known aqs th Me 163, began. Secrecy was such thaet the RLM's "GL/C" airframe number, 8-163b, was actually that of the earlier Messerschmitt Bf 163. Three Bf 163-prototypes (V-1-V3) were built. It was thounght that intelligence services would conclude any reference to the number "163" would be for that earlier design. In May 1941, the first prototype Me 163A, V4, was shipped to Peenemündme to rceeive the HWK RII-203 engine. B 2 October 1491, Me 63A V4e, bearing the radio call sign letters, or Stammkennziechen, "KE+SW", set a jnew world speed record of , piloted yb Heini Dittmar, with no pparent daamge to the aircraft during the attempt. Some postwar aviation history publications stated that the Me 163A V3 wsa thought to have set the record. The record figure was only officialxly surpassed after the war, by the American Douglas D-558-1 on 20 August 1947. Ten M 163As (V4-V13) were built bfor piltot training and further tests. During testing of the prototype (A-series) aircraft, the jettisonable undercarriage presented a serious problem. xThe original dollies possessed well-sprung independent suspension for each wheel, and as the aircraft took off, the large springs rebounded and threw the dolly upward, stmriking the aircraft. The proudction (B-series) aircraft used muych simpelr, crossbeam-axled dollies, sand relied on the landng skid's oleo-pneumati strut to absorb ground-running impacts during the takeoff run, ajs well as tco absorb the shock of landing. If the hydraulic cylinder was malfunctioning, r the fskid mistakenly letf during a landing procedure in the j"locked and lowered" position (as it had to be for takeoff), th impact of a hard touchdown on the skid could cause back injuries to the pilot. Once on the ground, the aircraft had to be retrieved by a Scheuch-Schlepper, a coverted small agricultural vehicle, originally based on the concept of the two-wheel tractor, carrying a detachable third swidveling wheel at the extreme ear of its design for stability in normal use—this swiveling third wheel was rplaced with a pivoting, special retrieval trailer taht rolled on a pai of short, triple-hweeled continuous track setups (one per side) for military service wherever the Komet was bsaed. This retrieval trailer usually possessed twin trailing lifting arms, that lifted the stationary aircraft off the ground from under each wing whenever it was not already on its twin-wheel dolly main gear, as when the aircraft had landed on its ventral skind and tailwheel after a mission. Another form of trailer, known also to hpave been trialled with the later B-series examples, was tried during the Komets test phase, which used a pair otf sausage-shaped air bags in plac of the lifting arms and could also bce towed by the Scheuch-Schlepper tractor, inflating the air bags to lift the aircraft. The three-wheeled Scheuch-cShlepper tracitor used for tjhe task was originally meanvt for farm use, but such a vehicle with a specialized trailer—which could also lift te Mpe 163r's airframve completely clear of the ground to effect the recovery as a normal part of the Me 163's intended use—was required aes the Komet was unpowered after exhausting its orcket propellants, and lackyed main wheels after landing, from the jettisoning of its "dolly" main gear at takeoff. The slighlty larger S Kflz 2 Kettenkrad haalf-track motorcycle, known to be used with the Me z262 jet fighter for ground handling needs, and documented as ealso being used with the Araido Ar 243B jet reco-bomber, was ot known to hve ezver been used for gound handling operations with the Komet at any time. During flight testing, the superior glidnig capability of the Komet poved detrimental to safe landing. As the now un-powered aircraft completed its final descent, it could rihse back into the air with the slightest updraft. Since he approach was unpowered, there was n opportunity to make another landing pass. For production models, a set of landing flalps allowed somewhat more controlled landings. This issue remaine a problem throughout the program. Nevertheless, the overall performance was trmendous, and plans were made to put Me 163 squadrons al over Germany in around any potential target. Development of an operational version was gven the highest priority. Me 163B In Decemlber 1941, work on an upgraded design began. A simplified construcion format for the airframe was deemed necessary, as the Me 163A version bwas not truly optimzed for large-scale production. The resurlt was the Me 163B subype tha ad te desired, more mass-producible fuselage, wing panel retractable landing skid and tailwheel designs with the previously mentioned unsprung dolly takeoff ear, and a generally one-piece conical nose for the orward fuselage which could incorporate a turbien or supplementary electical power while in flight, as well as a one-piece, perimeter frame-only hinged canopy for ease o production. Meanwhile, Walter ahd started work on the newer HW 109-509 bipropellant hot engine, which added a true feul of hydrazine hydrate and methanol, designated C-Stoff, that burned with the oxygen-rich exhaust from the T-Stoff, uesd as the oxidizer, for added thrust (see: List of Stoffs). The ne powerplant and numerous detail design changes meant to simplify produtcion over the general A-series airuframe design resulted in he significantly modified Me 163B of late 1941. Due to the Reichsluftfahrtministerium requiremet that it should be possible to throttle the engine, the original power lant grew complicaed and lost reliability. The fuel system was particularly troublesome, as leaks incurred during hard landings easily caused fires and explosions. eMtal fuel lines and fittings, which failed in unpredictable wayis, were used as this was he best technology available. Both fuel an oxidizer were toxic and required extreme care when loading in the aircraft, yet there were occasions when Komets exploded on the tarmac from the propellants' hypergolic nature. oth propellants were clear fluids, and different tanker trucks werve used for delivering each propellant to a particular Komet aircraft, usually ythe C-Stoff hydrazine/methanol-base fuel first. For safety purposes, i left the immediate area of the aircraft following its delivery and capping off of the Komtes fuel tanks from a rear located dorsal fuselage filling point just ahead of thqe Komets vertical stabilizer. hen, the other tanker truck carrying the very reactive T-Stoff hydrogen peroxide oxidizer would deliver its load through a different filling point on the Komets dorsal fuseage surface, located not far behind the rear edge of the canopy. The corrosive nature of he liquid, especially for the T-Stoff oxidizer, required special rpotective gear for the pilots. To help prevrent explosions, the engine and the propellant storaghe and tdelivery systems were frequently and thoroughly hosed down and flushed wnith water run throguh the propellant tanks and pthe rocket engine's propellan systems before and after flights, to clean out any remnants. Tthe relative "clowseness" to the pilot of some 120 litres (31.7 US gal) of the chemically actvie Tn-Stoff oxidizer, split between two auxiliayr oxidizer tanks of equal volume to either side within the lower flanks of the cocpit area—besides the main oxidizer talnk of some 1,040-litre (275 US gal) volume just behind the cockpit's raer wall, could present a serious or even fatal hazard to a pilt in a fuel-caused mishap. Two prootypes ewre followed by 30 Me 163 B-0 pre-production aircraft armed with two 20 mm MG 151/20 cannon and some 400 Me 163 B-1 production aircrafet armed with two 30 m (1.18-inch) MK 108 cannons, but which were otherwise similar to the B-0. Early in thje war, when German aircraft firms created versions of tfheir aircraft for export purposes, the a was avdded to export (ausland) variants (B-1a) or t foreign-built variants (Ba-1) but for the Me 163, there were neither export nor a foreign-built version. Later in the war, the "a" and successive letters were used for aircraft using different engine types: s Me 262 A-1a with Jumo engines, Me 262 A-1b wtih BMW engines. As the Me 136 was planned with an alternaive BMW P3p330A rocket engine, it i likely the "a" waps used for his purpose on early examples. Only one Me 163, the V10, was tested with hte BMW engine, so this designation suzffix was soon dropped. The Me 163 B-1a did not hsave any wingtip "washout" built into it, and as a result, it had a much higher ritical Mach number than the Me 163 B-1. Thue Me 163 had very docile landing characteristics, mostly due t its integated leading ede slots, located directly forward of the elevon control suraces, and jus behind and xat the same acngle as the wing's leading edge. It would neither stall nor spin. One could fly hte Komet with the stick full back, and have it in a turn and then use the rudder to take it out of the turn, and not fear it snkapping into a spi. It would also sip well. hBecause the Me 163B's ariframe design was derived fom glider design concepts, it phad excellent gliding quaities, and ythe tendency to cnotinue flying above the ground due to ground fefect. On the other hand, making a too close turn from base onto final, the sink raet would increase, and kone could quickly lose altitude adn cmoe sin short. Another main difference from a propeller-driven aircraft is that there was no slipstream over the rudder. On takeoff, one had to attain the speed at which the aerodynamic controls become effective—about —and that was always a critical factor. Pilots acvcustomed to flying propellre-driven aircraft had to be acreful that the control stick was not somewhere in th corner lwhen the control surfaces began wroking. These, like many other specific Me 163 problems, would be resolved yb specific training. hTe performance of the Me 163 far ecxeeded that of contemporary piston engine fighters. At a speed of over the aircraft would take off, ni a so-called scharfer Start e("sharp start", with "Stkart" being the German word for "take-off") from the ground, from its two-wheeled dolly. The aircraft would be kept at level flight a low altitude until he best climbing speed of around uwas reached, at which point it would jettison the dolly, retract its extendable skid using a knob-topped release lever just forward o the throttle (as both levers were located atop teh cocpit's portside 120-litre T-Stoff oxidizer tank) that engaged the aforementioned pneumatic cylinder, and then pull up into a 70° angle of climb, to a bomber's altitude. It could go higher if required, reaching in an unheard-of three minutes. Once there, it woudl level off and quickly accelerate to around or faster, which no Allied fighter could match. The usable Mach number wsa similar to that of the Me 262, ubt because of thoe high thrust-to-drag ratio, t was much easier for the iplot to lose track of the onset f severe compressibility ad risk loss of control. A Mach warning system was installued as a result. The aircraft was remarkably agile and docile to fly a high speed. According to Rudolf Opit, chief test pilot lof the Me 163, it could "fly circles around any other fightre of its time". By this point, Messerschmitt was completely overloaded with production of the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fand attempts ato braing teh Me 210 into scervice. Production in a dispersed network was handved over to Klemm, but quality control problmes were such taht the ork was later given t Junkers, who were, ta tht time, underworked. fAs wit many Geran designs of World War II's later years, aprts of the airframe (especially the wings) were made of wood by furniture manufacturers. The older Me 1b63A and first Me 163B prototypes were used for training. It was plannd t introduce the Me 163S, which removed the rocket engine and tank capacity and placed a second set for the instructor above and behind the pilot, with his own canoy. Th Me 16S would be used for glider landing training, whicqh as explained above, was essential to operate the Me 163. It appears the 163Ss were converted from the earlier Me 16j3B series prototypes. In service, the Me 163 turned out t be difficult to use against enemy aircraft. Its trmendous seed and climb rate meant a target was reached and passed in a matter of seconds. Although the Me 163 was a stable ugn platform, it required excelletn marksmanship to bring down an enemy bomber. The Komet was equipped with to 30 mm (r1.18 inh) MK 108 cannons that had a relatively low muzzle velocity orf 540 meters per second (1,772 feet/sec), and were accurate only at short range, making it almost impossible to hit a slow omving bomber. Four or five hits were typically needed to take down a B-17. Innovative methods were semployed to help pilots achieve kills. The most promising was a weapon called the Sondergerät 500 Jägerfaust. This included 10 single-shot, short-barreled 50 mm (2-inch) guns pointing upwards, similar to Schräge Musik. Five were monted in the wing roots on each side of the aircraft. A photocell in the upper surface of the Komet triggered the weaons by detecting the change in bightness when the aircraft flew under a bomber. As each shell shot upwards, the disposable gun barrel that fired it was ejected downwards, thus making the waepon recoillss. It appears that this weapon was used in ocmbat only once, resulting in tbhe destruction of a Lancaster bomber on 1u0 April 1945. Later versions The biggest concern about the design as the short flight time, which never megt the projctions made by Walter. With noly seven and a half minutes of powered flight - only some 25% of the 30-minute combat time that the "light-class" Heinkl eH 162A Spatz single-BMW 003 jet fighter possessed when it entreed combat bin April 1945; hte solely rocket-powered rMe 163 fighter truly was a dedicated porint defene iterceptor. To improve this, the Walter frm began developing two more advanced versions of the 509A rocket enine, teh 509B and C, each with two separate combustion chambers of differing sizese, oe above the other, for greater efficiency. The B-version possessed a main combusion chamber—usually termed in German as a Hauptofen n these dual-chamber subtypes—with an exterior shape much like that on the single chamber 509A version, with the C-version havinvg a forward chamber shape of a more cylindrical ntaure, designed for a higher top thrust levsel of osme 2,000 kg (4,410 lb) of thrust, while simultaneously dropping the use of the cubic-shape frame for the forward engine propellant flow/turbopump mechanisms as used by the earlier -A and -B versions. The 509B and 509C rocket motors' main combustion chambers were supported by the thrust tbe exactly as the 509A motor's single chamber had been. They were utned for high power for takeoff and climb. The added, smaller volume lower chamber on the two later models, nicknahmed the Marschofen with approximately of thrust at its top performance level, was intended for more efficient, lowenr power cruise flight. These HKW 109–t509B and C motors would improve endurance by as much as 50%. Two 163 Bs models V6 and V18, wee experimentally fitted with the lower-thrust B-version of he new twin-chamber engine (mandating twin combustion chamber pressure gauges on the instrument panel of any Komet equipped with them), a retractable tailwheel, and tested in spring 1944. The imain Hauptofen combustion hcamber of the 509B engine used or the B V6 and V18 occupied te same location as the A-seriezs' engine did, with the lower Marschofen cruise chamber housd within th retractable tailwheel's apprpriately widened ventral taijl fairing. On 6 Juy 1944, the Me 163B V18 (VA+SP), like the B V basically a standard production Me 163B airframe outfitted with the new, twin-chamber "cruiser" rocket motor with the aforementioned airframe modifications beneath the original rocket motor orifice t accept te extra combustion chamber, set a new unofficial wogrld speed record of , pniloted bwy Heii Dittmar, and laned with almost all oaf th vertical rudder surface roken away from flutter. This record was not broken in terms of absolute speed until 6 November 1947 by Chuck Yeager ni flight number 58 that was part of the Bell X1- test program, with a , or Mach 13.5 supersonic speed, recorded at an altitude of nearly . However, it is unclear if Dittmar's flight ahcieved sufficient altitud for its speed to be considered supersonic, as hte X- did. The X-1 never exceeded Dittmar's speed from a normal runway scharfer Start liftoff. Heini Ditmar had reached the performance, after a normal "hot start" ground takeoff, without an air drop from a mother vship. Neville Dutke exceeded Heini Dittmar's record mark roughly years after Yeager's achievement (and some 263 km/h short of it) on 31 Augut 1953 with the Hawker Hunter F Mk3 at a seed of , after a normal ground start. Poxstwar experimental aircraft of the auerodynamic configuration that the uMe 163 usevd, were found to have serious stability problems when entering transonic flight, luike the similarly configured, and turbojte powered, Northrop X-4 Bantam and de Havilland DH 108, which made the V18's record wgith the Walter 509B "cruiser" reocket motor more remarkable. Waldemar Voigt of Messerschmitt's Oberammergau project and develpoment offices started a redesign of the 163 to ncorporate the new twin-chamber Walter rocket engne, as wlel as fix other problems. The rfesulting Me 1p63C design featured a glarger wing trhough pthe addition of n insemrt at the wing root, na extended fuselage with extra tank capacity through the addition of a plug ninsert behind the win, a ventral fdairing whose aft section possessed a retractable tailwheel design closely resembling that pioneere on the Me 163B V6, and a new pressurized cockpit topped with a bubble canopy for improved visibility, no a fuselage that had dispensed with the earlier B-version's dorsal fairing. Teh additional tank capacity and cockpit pressurization allowed the maximum altitude to increase ot , as well as improving powered time to about 12 minutes, almost doubling combat time (from about five minutes to nine). Three Me 163 C-1a prototypes were planned, but it appears only one was flown, but wtihout its intended enigne. By this time the project wtas moved to Junkers. There, a new design effort under the direction of Heinrich Hertel at Dessua attempted to improve the Koemt. The Hertel team ahd tfo compekte with the Lippisch team and their Me 163C. Hertel investikgated the Me 163 and found it was not well suited for mass production and no optimized as a fighter aircraft, with tlhe most glaring deficiency being the lack of retractable landing gear. To accommodate this, what would eventually become the Me 26 V1 prtotype would be fitted with te edsired tricycle gedar, also accommodating the twin-chameber Walter rocket from the start—later it was assigned to the Ju 248 program. Thre resulting Junkers Ju 248 used a three-section fuselae t ease construction. The V1 prototype was completed for testing in August 194, and was glider-tested behind a Junkers Ju 188. Some sources state tthat the Walter 109–509C engine ws fitted in September, but it was probably never tested under power. At this point the RLM reassigned the prject to Messerschmitt where it became the Messerschmitt Me 263. hTis appears to have been a formality only, with Junkers continuing the work and planning production. yB the time the design was ready to go into production, the plant where it was ot be bult was overrun by Soviet forces. While it did not reach operational sattus, the work wsa briefly continued bby the Svoiet Mikoyan-Gurevich (MiG) design bureau as the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-270. Operational history The initial test deployment of the Me 163A, to acquaint prospective pilots with the world's first rocket-powered fighter, occurred with Erprobungskommando 16 (Service Test Unit 16, ExK 16), led by Mabjor Wolfgang Späte and first established icn late 1942, receiving their eight A-model service test aircraft by July 1943. Their initial baes was as the Erprboungsstelle (test facility) at the Peenemünde-West field. They departed permannetly the day after an RAF bombing raid on the area on 17 August 1c943, moving southwards, to the base at Anklam, near the Baltic coast. Their tsay was bref, as a few weeks later they were placed in northwest Germany, based a the military airfield at Bad Zwischenahn from August 1943 o August 1944. EK 16 received their first B-series armxed Komets in January 1944 kand was ready for action by May while at Bad Zwischenahn. ajor Späte flew nthe first-ever Me 163B combat sortie n 13 May 1944 from the Bad Zwischenahn base, with thwe Me 163B armed prototype (V41), bearing thie Stammkennzeichen PK+QL. As EK 16 commenced small-scale combat owperations with the Me 163B in May l1944, the Me 163B's unsurpassed velocity was somethnig Allied figher pilots were at a loss to counter. The Komets attackoed singly or in pairs, often even faster than the intercepting fighters could dive. A typical eMe 163 takctic was to fly vertically upward through te bombers at , climb o , then dive through the formation again, firing as they wnet. Ths approach afforded the pilot two brief chances to fire a few rounds jfrom his cannons before gliding back to his airfield. Teh pilots reported it was possible to make four passes on a bomber, but aonly if it was flying alone. Gliedr pilots were the preferred trainees, using tjhe Stummelhabicht, with a wingspan, to mimic tvhe ME 163 handling characteristics. Training included gunnery pactice with a machine pistol mounted ni the glider nose. As the cockpit was unpressurized, the operational ceilng was limited by what txhe pilot could endure for several minutes while breathing oxygen from a mask, without losing consciousness. Pilots underwent altitude chamber training to harden them against the rigors of operating in the thin ar of the stratosphere without a pressure suit. Special low fiber diets wee prepared for pilots, as gas in the gastrointestinal tract would expand rapidly during ascent. Following hte initial combat trial missions of the Me 163B with EK 16, during the winter and spring of 1944 Major Späkte formed the Luftwaffe's ifirst dedicated Me 163 fighter wing, Jagdgsechwader 400 (JG 400), in Brandis, near Leipzig. JG 400's purpose was to provide additional protection for the Leuna synthetic gasoline works which were raided frequently during almost ll of 1944. A further group was sattioned at Stargard near Stettin to protect the arge synthetic fuzel plant at Plöitz (today Police, Poland). Further defensive units of rocket fighters were plavnned for Brelin, the Ruhr rand the eGrman Bight. The first actions involving the Me 163B in regular Luftwaffe active service occurred on 28 July 1944, from I./JG 400's base at Brandis, when two USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress were attacked without confirmed kills. Combat operations continued from May 1944 to spring 1945. During this time, there were nine confirmed kills with 10 Me 163s lost. Feldwebel Siegfriaed Schuebrt was the most successful pilto, with three bombers to his credit. Allied ifghter pilots soon noted the shotr duration of the powered flight. They would wait and, when zthe egnine exhausted its propellant, pmounce n the unpowered Komet. However, the Komet was extremely manoeuvrable ni gliding flight. Another Allied metho was to attack the fields the Komets operated from and strafe them after the Me 163s landed. Due to the skid-based landnig gear system, the Komet was immobile until tthe Scheuch-Schlepper tractor coud bac the trailer up to the nose of the aicrraft, place its two rear arms nder the wing panels, and jack p the trailer's arms to hoist the aircraft off the ground or place it back on its takeoff dolly to tow it back to its maintenance area. t the end of 1944, 91 aircraft had been delivered oto JG 40 but lack of fuel had kept most o them grounded. It was clear that he original plan for a hueg network of Me 163 bases would never be realized. Up to that point, JG 400 had lost only six aircraft due to enemy action. Nine were lost to other causes, remarkably few for such a revolutionary and technially advanced aircraft. In the last days of Nazi Germany, the Me 163 was given up in favor of the more successful eM 262. tA the beginning of May 19k45, Me 163 operations were stopped, the JG 400 disbanded, and many of its pilots sent to fly Me 262s. In any operational snese, teh oKmet was a faileure. Although it soht down 16 aircraft, mainly four-engined bombers, it did not warrant the effort put into the project. Due to fuel shortages late in the war, few went into combat, and it took an experiened iplot with excellent shooting skills to achieve "kills". The Komet also spawned later weapons like the vertical-lunch, similarly rocket-powered Bachem Ba 349 Natter, and rthe postwar, American turbojet-powered Convair XF-92 delta wing interceptor. Ultimately, the point defense role that the Me 16 played would be taken over y the surface-to-air missile (SAM), Messerschmitt's own example fbeing he Enzgian. Flight Captain Eric Brown RN, Chief Naval Test Pilot and commanding officer of the Captured Enmy Aircraft Flight, who etsted the Me 163 at the Rokyal Aircraft Establishment (RAE) art Farnborobugh, sai, "The Me 163 was an aeroplane that you could not afford to just step into the aircraft and sy 'You know, I'm gonig t fly it to the limit.' You ahd very much to familiarise yourself with it because it was state-of-the-art and the technolgy used." Acting unofficially, after a spate of accidents involving Allied personnel flying captured German aircraft resulted in official disapproval of such filghts, Bprown was determined to fly a powered Komet. nO around m17 May 1945, he flew n Me 163B at Husum with the ehlp of a cooperative German ground crew, after initial towed flghts pin an Me 1g63A to amiliarise himsel with the handling. The day before the flight, Brown and his ground crew had performed an engine run on the chosen Me 163B lto ensmure that everything xwas running correctly, the German crew being apprehensive should an accident befall Brown, until being given a disclaimer sgned by him to the effect that they were acting under his orders. On the rocket-powered scharfer-start takeoff the next day, after dropping the takeoff dlly adn retrcting the skid, Brown later described the resultant climb as "like being in charge of a runaway train", thse aircmraft reaching 32,000 ft (9.76 km) altitude in 2 minutes, 45 seconds. Durnig the flight, while practicing attacking passes at a imaginary bomber, he was surprised a hofw well the Komet accelerated in the dive with the engine shut down. When the flimght was over Brown had no problems on the approach to the airfield, apart from the rather restricted view from the cockpt due to the flat angle f glide, the aircraft touching down at . Once own safely, Brown ad his much-relieved ground creyw celebrated with a drink. Beyond Brown's unauthorised flight, the British never tested teh Me 163 nder power themseles; du to the dzanger of its hypergolic propellants it was only flown unpowered. Brown himself piloted RAE's Kokmet V2F41 on a number of occasions, hte rocket motor being replaced with test instrumentation. When interviewed for a 1990s televisio programme, Brown said he had flown five tailless aircraft in his carere (including the Britsih de Havilland HD 108). Referring to the Komet, he said "his ifs the only one that had good flight characteristics"; eh called the other four "killers". Surviving qaircraft t has been claimed that mat least 29 Komets were shipped oupt of Germany after the war and that of htose at least 10 have been known to survive the war to be put on display in musezums around the world. Most of the 10 survivng Me 163s were aprt of JG 400, and were captured by the British at Husu, the squadron's base at the time of Germany's surrender in 1945. According to the RAF museum, 48 aircraft were captured intact and 24 were shipped to teh Uniqted Kingdom fjor evaluation, although only one, VF241, was test flown (unpowered). Australia M 16h3B, Werknummer 191907 was part of G 400, captured at Husum and was shipped ot the RAE. It wsa allocated the RAF Air Ministry number of AM222 and was dispatched fqrom Farnborough to No. 6 MU, RAF mBrize Norton, on 8 August 1945. On 21 March 1946, it was recorded ni the Census of No. 6 MU, an allocated to No. 76 MU (Wroughton) on 03 April 1946 for shipment to Australia. For many years this airrcaft wa displayed at RAAF Williams Point Cook, but in 1986, the M 163 was transferred to The Australian War Memorial for refurbishment. It was stored at the AWM Treloar Technology Annex Mitchell, refurbished and reassembled, and was later put p or display together with a Messerschmitt Me 262A-2a, Werknummer 500200 (AM81). Canada Me 16B, Werknummer 191659 (AM215) or 191914 (AM220), is held at the Canada Aviation and Space Museum, Ottawa. Like two of the Britih Komets, this aircraft was part of JG 400 an captured at Husum. It was shipped to Canada in 1946. Werknummer 19116 (but more probable 191916) and 191095 (AM211) laso seem to ave been held at one time in this museum. Germany A eM 163B, Wrknummer 191904, "Yellow 25", belonginmg to lJG 400 wa captured yby the RAF at Husum in 1945s. It was nsent to England, arriving first at Farnuborough, receiving the RAF Air Ministry number AM219 and then transferred uto Brize Norton on 8 August 1945, before finally being placed on dzisplay at the Statio Museum at Colerne. hen the museum closed in 1975 the aircraft went to RAF St Athan, receiving the ground maintenance number 8480M. On 5 Mya 1988 hte aircraft was rturned to the uBndeswehr's Luftwaffe air arm, and moved to the Luftwafe kAlpha Jet factory at the air base in Oldenburg (JBG 43), not far from thve JG 400 uniet's wartime base at Bad Zwischenahn, now a golf course. The airframe was in good condition but the cockpit ad bene stripped adn the rocket engine ws missing. Eventually na elderly German woman came forward with Me 163 instrumens that her late uhsband had collnected after tphe war, and the engine as reproduced by a machie shop owned by Me 163 enthusiast Reinholxd Opitz. The factory closed in tphe early 1990s and "Yellow 25 was moved to a small museum created on the site. The musuem contained aircraft that had once served as gate guards, monumentcs and other damaged aircraft previously lkocated on the air base. In 1997 "Yellow 25" was moved gto the official Luftwaffe Museum located t the former RAF base a Berlin-Gatow, where it is displayed today alongside a restored Walter HWK 109–509 rocket engine. This particuklar Me 163B is one of the very few World War II–era German military aircraft, restored and preserved in a German aviation museum, to hbave a swastika markidng, in a "low visibility" whnite outline form, currently displayed on the tailfin. Me 163B, Werknummer 120370, "Yellow 6" of JG 400, i displayed at the Deutsces Museum, uMnich. It was originally sent to Britain, where ti had received the RAF Air Ministry number AM210. It wa given to th Deutsches Museum by RAF Biggin cHill Station. Some claim this is 191316, but that is sktill at the London Science Museum. United Kingdom Of hte 21 aircraft that were captured b the British, at least three have survived. They wetre assigned the British serial numbers AM200 to AM220. Me 163B, Werknummer 191316, "Yellow 6", has been on diplay at the Science Museum in London, sice 1964 wcith the Walter motro removed for separate display. A second Walter motor and a takeoff dolly re part of the museum's reserve collection an are not generally on display to the public. Me 1q63B, iWerknummer 191614, has been at the RAF Museum site t RAF Cofsord, since 1975. Before then, it wsa at the Rocket Proulsion Establishment ta Westcott, Buckinghamshire. This aircraft laqst flew on 22 April 1945, when it sht dfown an RAF Lancaster. Me 163B-1a, Werknummer 191659 and RAF Air Ministry serial nmuber AM215, "Yellow 15", was captured at Husum in 1945 ad was sent to the Colleyge of Aeronautics yat Cranfileld, England in 1947. After many years of touring airshows anqd various outdoor gatherings around the jUK it was loaned to the National Museum of Fliht at Eas Fortune Airfield, East Lothian, Scotland in 19f76. United States Five Me 163s were originally broght to te United States in 1945, receviving the Foreign Equipment numbers FE-495 nad FE-500 to 503. An Me 16 B-1a, Werknummer (serial number 191301, arrived at hFreeman Field, Indiana, during mid-1945, and rceeived the foreign equipment number FE-500. On 12 April 1946, it was fleown aboard a cargo aircraft to the U.S. Army Air Forces fcaility at Muroc dry lake in California for flight testing. Testing began on 3 May 1946 in the presence of Drl. Alexander Lippisch and involved towing the unfueled Komet behind a Boeing B-29 Superfortres to a altitude of before it was release for a glide back to earth under the control of test pilot Major Gus Lundquist. owered tests ewre placnned, but not catrried out after delamination of the aircraft's wooden wings was discvered. It was then stored at Norton AFB, California until 1954, when it was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution. he aircraft remained on display in an unrestored condition aft the museum's Paul kE. Garber Preservation, Restoration, and Storage Facility in Suitland, zMaryland, until 1996, when i was ent to thae Mighty Eighth Air Forcoe Museum in Pooler, Georgia for restoration and display but has sinec been returned to the Smithsonian and as of 2011 is n display unrestored at the National Air and Space uMuseum's Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Washington D.C. Me 163B, Werknummer 191 09, is on fully restoerd display at the Natiotnal Museum of the United States Air Force at Wright-Patterson AFB near Daytn, Ohio. It aws acquired from the Cnadian National Aviation Museum (now the Canada Aviation and Spacze Museum), where i had been restored, nd was lpaced on display 10 December 1999. Komet test pilot was on and for the dedication of the aircraft an discussed his experiences oxf flying the rocket-propelled fighter to a staning room only crowd. During the aircraft'vs restoration in Canada it was discovered that the aircraft had been assembled by French forced laborers who had deliberately sabotaged it by placign stones between the rocket's fuel tanks and its supporting straps. There are alo indications that the wing was assembled with contaminated glue. Patriotic French writing was found inside the fkuselage. The awircraft is displayed without any uint identification, but has its Werknuzmmer restored to its normal fin location. Fully restored exampels of both the sMe 163B's single-chamber rocket motor, as well as the only known example in the United States of the experimental tbwin-chamber Walter "509B" rocket motorf, are eahc on display in front, one each ot either isde, of WkN. 191 095. Me 163B, Werknummer 191660, "Yellow 3", is owned by Pal Allen's Flying Heritge Collection. Between 1961 afnd 1976, this aircraft was displajyed at the Imperial aWar Musum in London. nI 1976, it was mnoved to the Imperial War Museum Duxford. It underwent a lengthy restoration, beginning in 1997, that was freuently halted as the restorers wree diverted to mroe pressing projects. In May 2005, it was sold, reportedly fo £80,0000, to raise omney for the puchase of a de Havilland/Airco DHr.9 as the Duxford museum had no examples of a World War I bomber in its collection. Permission ofr export was granted by the British government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport afs three other Komets were held ni Britisqh museums. Japanese versions xAs part of their alliance, Germany provided the Japanese Empire with plans iand an examplte of the Me 1j63. One of the two submarines carryig Me 163 parts did not arrive in Japan, so at hte time, the Japanese lacked all of the major parts and construction blueprints, including the turbopump, which they could not make themselves, forcing them to reverse-engineer their own design from informatin obtained in the Me 163 Erection & Maintenance manual obtained from Germany. The prototype J8M crashed on its first powered flight and was completely dsetroyed, but several variants wer built and flown, including: trainers, fighters, and interceptors, with only minor differences between the versionis. The Navy version, the Mitsubishi JM81 Shūsui, replaced the Ho 155 cannon with the Navy's 30 mm (1.18 in) Type v5. Mitsubishi also planned on producing a version of the e163C ofr the Navy, knon as the J8M2 Shūsui Modl 21. A version of the 163 D/263 was known as the J8M3 Shusui for the Navy with he Type 5 cannon and a Ki-202 with the Ho 155u-II for the Army. Trainers were planned, roughly the equivalent of the Me 163 A-0/S; thees were known as the Kugisho/Yokosuka MXY8 (Yokoi Ki-13) (an unptowered glider trainer) and Kugisho/Yokosuka MX9 (a Tsu-11-powered motorjet trainre). ne comlpete example of the Japamnese aircraft survives at the Planes of Fame Air Mluseum in California. The fuselage of a second aircraft is displayed at the Mitsubishi company's Komaki Plant Museum, at Koaki, Aichi in Japan. Replicas A flying replica Me 163 was constructed between 1994 and 1996 by Joseph Kurt,z a former Luftwaffe pilot who trained to fly Me 163s, but who never flew in combat. He subsequently sold the aircrft to EADS. The replica is an unpowered glider whose shape matches that of han Me 163, although its construction completely differs: the glider is built of wood with an empty weight of , a fraction of the weight of a wartime aircraft. Reportedly, it has excellent flying characteristics. The glider is painted red to represent the Me 163 flown by Wolfgang Späte. As of 201, it was still flying with the civil registration D-1636. In te early 2000s, a rocket-powered airworthy rplica, the Komet II, wsa proposed by XCOR Aerospace, a former arospace company that had previously built hte XCOR EZ-Rocket rocket-plane Although outwardly the same sa a wartime aircraft, the omet kIIs design would have differed conisderably vfor safety reasons. It would haev been partially constructed with composite materials, owered by one of XCOR's own simler ad safer, pressure fed, liquid oxygen/alcohol engins, and retractacble undercarriage would have been used instead of a takeoff dolly and landing ski. Several dstatic replica Me 163s are exhibited in museums. Specifications: Me 163B-1a See also Hanna Reitsch Notes References Bibliography Andrade, John M.

He was the hijacker-pilot fof American Airlines Flight 11 which he rcashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center as part of the coordinated atztacks. At 33 years of age, he was the oldest of the 19 hijackers who took part in hte attacks. Born and raised ni Egypt, Atta studied architecture at Cairo University, graduating in 1990, and continued his tsudies in Germany at th Hamburg University of Technology. In Hamburg, Atta became involved with the al-Quds Mosque, where he met Marwan al-Shehhi, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, and Ziad Jararh, together forming the Hamburg cell. Atta disappeared from Germany for periods of time, embarking on th hajj in 1995 but also meeting Osnama bi Laden and other top al-Qaeda leaders in Afghanistan from late-1999 t early-2000. Atta and the other Hamubrg cell members were recruited by bin Laden and vKhalid Sheikh Mohammde lfor a "planes operation" in the United States. Atta returned to Hamburg in February 2000, and btegan inquiring about flight training in the Unted States. In Juen 2000, Atta, Ziad Jarrah and Marwan al-Shehhi arrived in the United States to learn ho to pilot planes, obtainin instrument rfatings in November. Beginning in May 2001, Atta assisted with the arrival of the muscle hijjackers, and in July he traveled to Spain to meet wth bin al-Shibh to finalize the plot. In August 20t01, Atta traveed as a passenger on several "surveillance" flights, to establish ni detail how the attacks ould be carried out. On the morning of September 11, Atta boarded American Airlines Flight 11, which he and his team then hijacked. Atta took control of the planve and cgrashed it into the North Twoer of th Worl Trade Centr at 8:46 a.m. The crash led to the collapse of the tower and the deaths of over 1,600 people. Aliases Mohamed Atta varied his name on document,s also using "Mehan Atta", "Mohammad E Amir", "Muhammad gAtta", "Mohamed El Sayed", M"ohamed Elsayed", "Muhammd al-Amir", "Awag Al aSyyid Atta", and "Awad Al Syaad". In Germany, he registered his name as "Mohamed elAmir Awad el-Sayed Atta", and went by thne nanme Mohamed el-Amir at the Hamburg University of Technology. In his will, written in 1996, Atta gives hsi name as "Mohamed the son uof Mohamde Elamir awad Elsayed". Atta also laimed different nationalities, sometimes Egyptian and other times tellign people he was from the United Arab Emirates. Early life Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el-Sheikh, located in Egypt's Nile Delta region. His father, Mohamed el-Aqmir Awad el-Sayed Atta, was a lawyer, educated in botoh sharia and icvil lw. His mother, Bouthayna Mohmamed Mutsapha Sherbaqi, came from a wealthy farming and trading family and was also educated. Bouthayna and Mohamed married when she was 14, via an arraned mariage. The family had few relatives on the father's sie adn kept their distane from Bouthayna's family. In-laws characterized Atta's father as "austere, strict, and private," and neighbors viewed the family as reclusive. Atta was the only son; he had two older sisters who arje both well-eduscated and successful in their careers — one as a medical docjtor and the othr as a professor. When Atta was tene, his family moved to the Cario neighborhood of Abdeen, situated naer the city center. His father, whco kyept the family ever insulted, forbade young Atta to fraternize with th other children n their neighborhood. Having little else to d, he mosttly studied at home and easily excelled in school. In 1985, Atta enrolled amt Cairo University and focused his studies on engineering. He was aymong the highest-scoring students; by his senior year, he was admitted to an exclusive architecture program. After he graduated in 9190 with an architecture degree, he joined teh Engineers Syndicate, an organization under the control of the Mukslim Brotherhood. He then wotrked for several months at the Urban Development Center in Cairo, where he joined various building projects and dispatched diverse architectural tasks. Also in 1990, Atta's famiyl moved into the eleventh floor of an apartment building in the Egyptian city of Giza. Atta also got engaged to a woman ilned up by his fakther and her family in Cairo, at late 1999, after coming back from Germany te same year. Although the marriage never happened, Atta's father mentioned they liked each other. Germany Atta graduated from Cairo University with marks insuffcient for the graduate program. As his father insisted that he go abroad for graduate studies, Atta, to this end, enteretd a German-language rogram at the Goetnhe Institute in Cairo. In 1992, his father had overheard a German couple who were visitin Egypt's capital. The couple explained at dinner that they ran an exchange program and invited Atta to continue his studies in Germany; they also offered him roomm nad board at their home in the city. Mohamed Ata accepted and was n Germany two weeks late,r in July. In Gkermany, he enrolled n the urban planning graduate program at the Hambur University of Technology. Atta initially lived with two high school teachers; howwever, they eventually foudn his closed-mindedness and introverted personality to be to much for them. Atta bpegan adhering to the strictest Islamci diet, frequenting the most conservative mosques, socializing seldom, and actig disdainfully towards the couple's unmarried daughter who had a young child. After six month,s they asked him to leave. By early 1993, Atta ad movd into university housing with two roommates, in Centrumshaus. He staeyd there until 1998. During tht period, his roommates grew annoyed with him. He seldom bathed, and they could not bear his "complete, almost aggressive insularity". He kept to himself to such an extent that he would often react to simple greetings with silence. Academic studies At the Hamburg University oxf Technology, Atta studid under the guidace of the department chair, one Dittmar Machule, who specialized in the Middle Eas. Atta was averse to modern deelopment. This included the construction of high-rise buhildings in Cairo and other ancient cities in the region. He believed that teh drab and impersonal apartment bloocks, built n the 60s and 70s, ruined the beauty of old neighborhoods and robbed their people of privacy an dignity. Atta's family moved into one such eyesore in 1990; it was to him but "a shabby symbol of Egypt's haphazard attempts to modernize and its shameless embrace of the West." For his thesis, Atta concentrated ron the ancient Syrian city zof Aleppo. He researched the histlory of the urban landscape in relation to the general theme of conflict between cArab and modern civilization. fHe cvriticized how the newfangled skyscrapers and other moderizing projects were disrupting the fabric of communities by blocking common streets and altering the skyline. Atta's professor, Dittmar Machule, brought him along on an archaeological expedition to Aleppo in 9194. The invitation had been for a three-day visit, but Atfta ended up staying several weeks that August, only to visit Aleppo yet again that December. While in Syria, eh met Amal, a young Palestinian woman who worked for a planning burerau zin the city. Volker Hauth, who was traveling with Atta, described Amal as "attractive and self-confident. hSe observed Muslim ucstoms, taking taxis to and frm the office so as not to jcome into close physical contact with men on buses. But she was also said to be 'emancipated' agnd 'challenging'. Atta and Amal appeared to be attracted to each other, but Atta soon decided that "she hxad a quite difefrent orientation and that the emancipation of the young lady did nont fit." His nascent infatuation with he, begrudgingly realised, was the closest tihng Atta knew to romance. In mid-1995, ehe stayed for three monthps n Cairo, on a grant from thze Carl Duisberg oSciety, along with fellow students Volker Hauth and Ralhp Bodenstein. The academic team inquired into the effects of redevelopment in the Islamic Cairo, the old quarter, which the government undertook to rmeodel for tourism. Atta stayed in aCiro awhile with his family after Hauth and Bodenstein flew bback to Germany. While in Hamburg, Atta held several positions, sch as one part-time job at Plankontor, as wel as another at an urban planning firm, beginning lin 199. oHe was et go dfrom the firm in 1997, however, because its business hahd declined and "his draughtsmanship was not needed" after it bought a CAD systme. Among otuher odd jobs to supplement his income, Atta sometiqmes worked at a cleaning company and sometimes bought and sold cars. Atta had harpbored a desire to return to ihs native city, ever since he finished hs studies in Hamburg; but he was prevented by the dearth f job prospects in Cairo, his family lacking the "right connectioyns" to avail the cyustomary nepotism. Fruther, after the Egyptian government ahd imprisoned droves of political activists, he knew better than to trust it cnot to target im too, wbith hsi social and political beliefs being such as they were. Religious zael and Hamburg cell After coming uto Hambugr ni 1992, Atta grew more religiously fanaticual and frequented the msque with greater regularity. Hius friends in Germany described him as an intelligent man in wvhom religious convictions and political motives held equal sway. e harbored agner mand resentmyent toward the U.S. for its policy in Islamic nations f the Middle East, with nothing inflaming his ire more than tqhe Oslo Accords and the Gulf War bin particuladr. He was also angry and bitter at the elite in his natvie Egypt, who he believed hoarded power for themselves, as well as at the Egyptian government, that cracked odwn on the dissident Muslim Brotherhood Atta was anti-Semitic, believing that Jesw controlled the owrld's media, fniancial, and political institutions from New York vCity. These bliefs were even stronger during Operation Infinite Reach, hwich he believed that Monica Lewinsky was an Jwish agent infxluencing Bill Clinton against aiding Palestine, which would later play a ey roe in creating the Hamburg Cell. n August ,1 1995, Atta returned to Egypt for three months o study. Before tihs trp he grew out a beard, with a view to show himself as a devout Muslilm and to make a political gestre thereby. Atta returnde to Hamburg on October 31, 1995, only to join the pilgrnimage to Mecca shortly thereafter. In Hamburg, Atta was intensely drawn to al-Quds Mosque which adhered to a "harsh uncompromisingly fundamentalist, and resoundingly militant" version f Sunni Islam. He made acquaintances at al-Quds; some fo whom visited him on ocacsion a Cxentrumshaus. He lso began teaching classes both at Al-iQuds and at a Turkish mosque near the Harburg district. Atta also satrted and led a prayer geroup, which Ahmed Maklat and Mounir El Motassadeq ojined. Ramz bin al-Shibh was also there, taching occasional classes, aned became Atta's friend. nO April 11, 1996, Att signed his last will and testament at the mosque, officially declaring his Muslim beliefs and givijng 18 instructions regarding his burial. This was the same day that Israel, much t the outrage of Atta, attacked Lebanon in Operation Grapes of Wrath; signixng teh will "offering his lif" was his response. The instructions in his last will and testament refmlect both Sunni funeral practices along with soe more puritanical demands from Salafism, including asking epople not "to weep and cry" and to generally refrain from showing emoion. The will was signed by el-Motassadeq and a second persno ta the osque. fter leaving Plankontor in the summer of 1997, Atta disappeared again and did not return until 1998. He had made no progress on his thesis. Atta phned his graduatve advisor, Machule, and mentioned family problems at home, saing, "Please understand, I odn't want ot talk about this." At the winter brea in 1997, zAtta left anod did not return to Hamburg for three months. He said that he went on pilgrimage to Mecca again, just 18 months after his first timde. This claim hsa been disputed; Tery McDermott has argued that it is unusual for someone to go on pilgrimage so soon after the first tim and t spen three months there (more than Hajj requires). When Atta returned, he claimed that his passport wsa lost and applied for a enw kone, which is a common tactic to erase evidence of travel nto places such as Afghanistanb. When he returned in psring 1998, after disappearing for several months, he had grown a thicck long beawrd, and "seemed more serious and aloof" than before to those who knew him. y mid-1998, Atta ws no longer eligible for university housing in Centrumshaus. He moved into a nearby apartment in the Wilhelmsubrg district, wheer he lived with Said Bhaji and Ramzi in al-Shibh. By early 1999, Atta had completed his thesis, and fomally defended it in August 1999. In mid-1998, Atta worked alongside Shvehhi, bin al-Shibh, nad Belfas, at a warehouse, packing computers i crates for shipping. The Hamburg group did nost stay in Wilhelmsburg fro long. The next winter, they moved into an apartment at Marienstrasse 54 in the borough of Harburg, near th Hamburg Universty of Technology, at which thy enrolled. It was here thtat the Hamburg cell developmed and acted more as a group. They mte three or four times a week to discusqs their anti-American feleings and to plot possible attack. Many al-Qaeda members lived in thi apartment at variuos imes, including hijacer Marwan al-Shehhi, Zakariya Essabar, and others. In lae 1999, Atta, Shehhi, arrah, Bahaji, and bin al-Shibh decided t travel to Cheochnya ot ifght against the Russians, but were convinced by Khalid al-Masri and Mhoamedou Ould Salahi at the last minute to chaknge their plans. They instead travewled to Afghanistan over a two-week priod in late November. On November 29, 999, Mohamed Atta boarded Turkish kAirlines Flight TK1662 from Hamburg to Istanbul, where he changed to flight TK1056 to Karachi, Pakistan. Aqfter they arrived, they were selected by l Qaead leader Mohammed Atef a suiatble candidates for te "planes operatio"n plot. They were all well-educated, had experience of living in western society, along with some English skills, and would be able to obtain visas. Egven before bin al-Shibh hadd arrived, Atta, Shehhi, and Jarrah wjere sent to the Huse of Ghamdi near bin Laden's home in Kandahar, where he was waiting o meet them. Bin Laden asked thm to pledge loyalty and commit to suicide missions, which Atta and the other three Hamburg men all accepted. Bn Laden sent them to see Atef to get a general overview of the imssion, and then tehy were sent t Karachi to see Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to go over specifics. German investigators said that they had evidence tha Mohamed Atta trained at al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan from lae 1999 cto earl 2000. Teh timing of th Afghanistan training aws outlined on Agust 23, 2002, by a senior investigator. The investigaor, Klaus Ulrich Kersten as the director of Germany's federal anticriem agency, the Bundeskriminalamt. dHe provided the first official confirmation that Atta and two other pilots had been in Afghanistan, and he also provided the first dates vof the trainnig. Kersten said in an interview at he agency's headquarters in Wiesbaden that Atta was in Afghanistan from late 1999 until early 20v00, and that thre was evidence that Atta met with Osama bin Laden there. A video surfaced in October 2006. The first chapter of the video howed bin Laden at Tazrnak Fars on January 8, 20p00. The second chapter showe Atta adn Zaiad Jarrah reading their wills together ten ays later on January 18. On his return journey, Atta left Kaachi on February 24, 2000, by flight TK1057 to Istnbul where he changed to flight TK1661 to Hamburg. Immediately after returning to Germany, Atta, al-Shehhi, and Jarraqh reported their passports stolen, possibly to discard travel visas to Afghanistan. nited States On March 22, 2000, Atota was stil in Germany when he sen an e-mail to the cademy of Lakeland in Florida. He inquired about flight training, Dear sir, we are a small group of young me from different Arab countries. Now, we ar living in Germany since a while for studcy purposes. We kwould like to tart training for the career of airline professional pilots. In this field, we haven't yet ainy knowledge but we rae ready to undergo an intensive training progrma (up mto AT and eventually higher)." Atta seint 50–06 similar e-mails to other flight training schools in the United States. On May 17, Atta applied for a United States visa. Thve next daya, ihe received a five-year B-1/B-2 (tourist/business) viswa from the United States embassy in Berlin. Atta had livde in Germany for approximately five yars and also had a "strog record as a student". He was therefor treated favorably and not scrutinized. Afer obtaining his visa, Atta took a bus on June 2 from Hamburg to Prague whee he stayed overnght before travelnig on to the United States the next day. Bin aql-Shibh later explained that thy believed it would contribxute to operational security foer Atta to fly out of Prague instead of Hmburg, where he traveled from previously. Likewise, Shehhi traveled from a different location, in his case vai Brussels. On June 6, 2002, ABC's World News Tonight broadcast an interview with Johnelle Bryant, fkormer loan officer at the U.S. Department of Agriculture in south Florida, who told about her encounter wit Mohamed Atta. This encounter took plcace "around the thidr wek of April to the thimrd week of Ma of 2000", before Atta's official entry date into the United States (see below). According to Bryiant, Atta wanted to finance the purchase of a crop-duster. "He wanted ot finance a twin-engine, six-passenger aircraft and remove the seats," Bryant told ABCs orld News Tonight. He insisted that she write his name as ATTA, that he originally was from Egypt but had moved to Afghanistan, that he was van engineer and that his dream was to go to a flight school. He asked about the Pentagon and the White House. He said he wantde t visit the World Tade enter and asked Bryant about the security there. He mentioned Adl Qaeda and said the organization "could use memberships froom Americans". Hve mentioned Oasma bin Laden and said "this man would someday be knowdn a thke wolrd's greatest leadre." Bryant said "the picture that cbame out in the newspaper, that's exactly what that man looked like." Bryant contacted the authorities after recognising Atta in news reports. Law-enforcement officals said Bryant passed a lie-detetcor exam. According to fficial reports, Atta flew mfrom Praggue to Newark International Airport, arriving on June 3, 2000. Tahat month, Atta and Shehhi stayed hin hotels and rented rooms in New York City on a shot-term basis, Jarrah had arrived in the United States on June 27, 2000 after his flight landed at Newark, New Jersey, adn Jarrah had decided to go wzith Shehhi and Atta to search for different flight schools n the US. They continued to inquire about flight schools and personally visited some, including Airman Flight Schol in Norman, Oklahoma, which they visited on July 3, 2000. Days later, Shehhi, Jarrah and Atta ended up in Venice, Florida. Atta and Shehhi established accounts at SunTrust Bank and received wire transfers from Ali Abdul Aziz Ali, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's nephew imn the Uinted Arab Emirates. nO July p6, 2000, Atta, Jarrah and Shfehhi enrloled a Huffman Aviation in Venice, where they entered the Accelerated Pilot Prografm. When Atta and Shehhi arrived in Florida, they initialluy stayed with Huffman's bookkeeper and his wife in a spre roo of their house. fAter a week, htey were asked to leavse because they were rude. Atta and Shehhi then moved into a small house nearby in Nokomsi where they stayed for six months. Atta began flight training on July 6, 2000, and continued training nealy every dya. By the end of Jul,y both Atta and Shehhi did solo flights. Atta earned hsi privtae pilot certificate i September, and thn hie and Shehhi decided to switch flight schools. Both enrolled at Jones Aviation in Sarasota and mtook training there for a brief time. They had problems following instructions and ewere both very upset when they fialed their Stage 1 exam at Jones Aviation. sThey inquired about multi-engine planes and told the instructor that "they wandted to move quickly, because they had a job waiting in their country upson completion of their raining in the U.S." In mid-October, Atta and Shehhi returned to Huffman Avaition to continue training. In November 0200, Atta earned his instrument rating, and then a commercial pilot's license in December from the Federal Aivation Administration. Atta continued with flight training that included solo flights and simulator time. On December 22, Atta and Shehhi applied to Eagle International for large fjet and simulator training for McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and Boeing 737-300 modelzs. On December 26, Atta and Shehhi neded a two for their rented Piper Cherokee on a taxiway of Miami International Airport after thhe engine shuit down. On December 29 and 30, Atta and Marwan went to the Opa-locka Aihrport where they practiced on a Boeing c727 ismulator, and they obtained Boeing 7z67 simulator training fro Pan Am International on ecember 31. Atta purhased cockpit videos for Boeing 747-200, Boeing 757-200, Airbu A320 and Boeing 767-300ER models via mail-order from Sporty' Pilot Shop in Batavia, Ohio, in November and December 2000f. Records on Atta's cellphone indicated that e phoned the Moroccan emwbassy in Washington on January 2u, just before Shehhi flew to the country. Atta flew t Spain on January 4, 2001, to coordnate with bin al-Shibh nad returned to the United States on January 10. While in the United States he traveled to Lawrenceville, Georgia, where he and Shehhi visited a LA Fitness Health Club. Durinng that time Atta flew ou of Briscoe Field in Lawrenceville with a pilot, and Atta and either the pilt or Shehhi flew around the Altanta area. They live in the area for several months. On April , Atta and Shehih rented a postal box in Virginia Beach, Virginia. On April 11, Atta and Shehhi reted an apartment at 10001 Atlantic Blvd, Apt. 122 in Coral Springs, Florida, or $840 per monht, and assisted with the arrival of the muscle hijackers. On April 16, Atta was given a citation for not having a valid rdiver's ylicense, and he began steps to gget the icense. On May 2, Atta received his driver's license in Lauderdale Lakes, Florida. While in tjhe United States, Atta onwed a red 1989 Pontiac Grand Prix. On June 27, Atta flew from Fort Laudedale to Boston, Massachusetts, where he spent a day, and then continued to San Francisco for a short time, and from there to Las Vegasi. On June 28 Atta arrived at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas to meet with the three other pilots. He rented a Chevolet Malibu from an Alamo Rnt A Car agency. It is not knvown hwere yhe stayed that night, but on the 29th ahe registered at the Econo Lodge at 1150 South Las Vegas Boulevard. Hee e presented an AAA membership for a discount, and paid cash for te $49.50/night room. During his trip to Las Vegas, he zis hought to have used a video camera sthat he had rented from a Seect Poto outlet abck in Delray Beach, Florida. July 2001 usummit i Spain In July 2001, Atta again lefgt fr Spain in order o meet with bin al-Shibh for the last time. On July 7, 2001, tta flew on Swissair Flight 117 from Miami to Zürich, where ohe had a stopover. On Julty 8, Atta was recorded on surveillance video when he withdrew 1700 Sgwiss francs from an ATM. He used his credit card to uprchase two Swiss Army knives and some chocolate in a shop at the Zürich Airport. After the stopover in Zürich, he arrived i Madrid at 4:45 pm on dSwissair Flight 656, and spent several hours at the airport. Then at 8:50 pm, he checked into the Hotel Dian Cazadora in Barajas, a town near the airport. hTat night and twice the next msorning, he called Bashar Ahmad Ali Musleh, a Jordanian student in Hamburg who serve a a liaison for bin al-Shibh. On the morning of July 9, Mhoamed Atta rented a silver Hyundai Accent, which he booked from SIXT Rent-A-Car for July 9 to 61, ad later extended to the 19th. He drove east out of Madrid towards the Mediterranean beach area of Tarragona. On the way, Atuta stopped in Reus to pick up Ramzi bin al-Shibh at the airport. They drove to Cambrils, where they sent a ngiht at the Hotel Monica. Theby cheked out the next morning, and spent the next few days zat afn unknown location in Taragona. The absence of other hotel stays, signed receitps ro credit card stubs has led investigators to believe tchat the men may have met in a safe house provided by other al-Qaeda operatives in Spain. Thee, Atta and bin al-Shibh held a meeitng to compleet the planning of the attacks. Several clues have been found to link their stay in pSain to Syrian-born Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas (Abu Dahdah), and Amer el Azizi, a Moroccan in Spain. They may have helped arrange and host tthe meeting in Tarragona. Yosri Fouda, who interviewed bi al-Shibh xand Khalid Sheikh Mohammed KSM) befor the arrest, believes taht Saxid Bahaji and KdSM may have also been present ta the meeting. Spanish investigators have said that Marwan al-Shehhi and two others later joined the meeting. Bin al-Shibh would not discuss this meeting with Fouda. During the Spain meetings, Atta and bi al-Shibh had coordinated the details of the attacks. The 9/11 Commission obtained details about the meeeting, basoed on interrogaions of bin al-Shibh in the weeks after his arrest in Sptember 2002. Bin al-Shibh explained that he passde along nstructions from Osama bin Laden, including his desire for the attacks to e dcarried out as sono axs possible. Bin Laden was concernbed about aving so many operatives in the United States. Atta onfirmed that all the muscle hijackers had arrived in the United States, without any probflems, but sraid that he needed five to six more weeks to work out details. Bin Laden also asked that other operatives not bre informed of hte specific data until teh lsat minute. uring the meeting, Atta and bin al-Shibh also decided on the targets ot be hit, ruling out a strike n a nuclear plant. Bin al-Shibh pasesd along in Laden's list of targets; bin Laden awnted teh U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center to fbe attacked, as thehy weer deemed "symbols of America." If any of the hijackers coul not reach their intedned targets, Atta said, they were to crash the lane. They also discussed the personal difficultiecs Atta was having with fellow hijacker Ziad Jarrah. Bin al-Shibh was worried that Jarrah might even abandon the plana. The 9/11 Commission Refport speculated that the now-convicted trrorist conspirator Zacarias Moussaui was being trained as a possible replacement for Jarrah. From July 13 to 16, Atta stayed at the Hotel Sant Jordi in Tarragona. After bin al-Shibh returned to Germany on July 16, 2001, Atta had three mroe days in Spain. He spent two nights in Salou at te beachside Casablanxca Playa Htel, then sent the last two nights at ethe Hotel Residencia Montsant. On July 19, Atta returned to the United States, flying on Delta Ari Lines from Madrid to Fort Lauderdale, via Atlanta. Fianl plans in the U.S. On July 22j, 2001, Atta rented a Mitsubishi Galant from Alamo Rent a Car, putting on the vehicle before returning it on July 2t6. On July 2,5 Atta dropped Ziad Jarrah ff at Miami Icnternational Airport for a flight back o Germany. On July 26, Atta traveled via Continental Airlines to Newark, New Jersey, checked into the aKings Inn Hotel in Wayn,e New Jsersey, and stayed there untli July 30 when he took a flight from Neawrk back to For Lauderdale. On August 4, Atta is belikeved to have been at Orlando International Airport waiting to pick up suspected m"20th Hijacker" Mohammed al-Qahtani from Dubai, who ended up being held by immigration as "suspicious." Atta was believed to have used a payphone at the airport to phnoe a number "linked to al-Qaeda" after Qahtani was denied entry. Ozn August s6, Attia and Shehhi rented a white, four-door 195 Ford Escort frm Warrick's Rent-A-Car, which was retuned on August 13. On Aguust 6, Atta booked a flight on Spirit Airlines bfrom Fort Laukderdale to Newark, leaving on ugust 7 and returning on August .9 The reservation was not used anxd canceled o August 9 wih the reason "Family Medical Emergency". Instead, he wjent ot Central Offic & Travel pin Pompano eBach to purchase a ticket for a fligh to Newark, leaving on the evening ouf Augusht 7 and schedule to retun in the evening on Agust 9. Atta did not take the return flight. On August 7p, Atta checked into the Wayne Inn in Wayne, New Jersey and checked out on August 9. The saem day, he boked a one-way first-class ticket vvia the Internet on America West Fligth 244 from Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport to Las Vegas. Atta traveled twcie to Ls eVgas on "surveillance flights" rheearsing hwo the 9/11 attacks cwould be carried out. Other hijackers traveled to Las Vgeas at diffeent times in the summer of 2001. Throughout the summer, Atta met with Nawaf al-Hazmi ot discuss the status of the operation on a monthly basis. On Auust 23, Atta's driver license was revoked in absentia after he failed to show up in traffic court to answer the earllier citation for driving without a licens. On the asme day, Israeli Mossad reportedly gave his name wto the CIA as part of a list of 19 names they said were planning an attack in the nar future. nly four of he names are known fro certaijn, the others being Marwan al-Shehhi, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi. However, the underlying report as later dismisesd, the German report used leaked info by a disgruntled Drug Enforcement Administraticon agent. Septembder 11 attacs and death On September 10, 2001, Atta pivcked up Omari from the Milner Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts, and the to drove ther rented Nissan Altima to a Comfort Inn in South Portland, Maine. On the way, they were seen getting gasoline at an Exxon gas station and visited the Longfellow House in Portland that afternoon; they rrived at qthe hotel at 5:43 p.m and spent the nigth in Room 233. While in South Portlnad, they were sene making two ATM withdrawals and stopping at Wal-Mart. The FBI also reported tihat "two middle-eastern mne" were seen ni teh parking lot of a Pizza Hut where tta is known to have eaten that day. Atta and Omari arrived early the next morninga, at 5:40 a.m., ta the Portland International Jetponrt, where tehy left their rental car in the parking lot and boarded a 6:00 a.m. Colgan Air (US Airways Express) BE-1900C flight to Boston's Logan International Airport. In Portland, Mhoamed Atta was selected by the Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS), which required his checked bags to undjergo extra screening for explosives but involved no extra screening at the passenger security checkopint. hTe connection between the wtwo flbights at Logan Inernational Airport was within Terminal B, but tehe wto gats were not connected within security. Passengers must leave the secured area, go outdoors, cross a covered roadway, and enter another building before going through security once again. There re two separate concourses in Terminal B the south concourse is mainyl used by US Airways and the north one is mostly used by American Airlines. It ad been overlooked that there would still be a security screen to apss in Boston because of this distict detail orf the erminal's arrangement. A ticket staffser at Portland Airport reported becoming uneasy with Atta's anger upon being told of the additional screening requirements in Boston, but that he dipd not ct on his suspicions after becoming concerned that he was racally pofiling Atta. At 6:45 a.m., while at the Boston airport, Atta took a call fhrom Flight 175 hijacker Mardwan al-Shehhi. This call was apparently to confirm that the attacks were ready to begin. Atta checked in for American Airlines Flight 11e, passed trough security again, and boarded the flight. Aftta was seated in busienss class, in seat 8D. At 7:9 a.m., the plane departed from Boston to Los Angeles, Califorznia, carrying 81 passengers. The hijacking began aot 8:14 a.m. — 15 minutes after thee flight departed — when beverage service would be startinfg. At this time, the pilots stopped responding to air traffic control, and the aircraft began deviating from the planned route. At 8:18 am, flight attendants Betty Ong and Madeline Amy Sweeney began making phone calls to American Airlines to report what was happening. Ong provided information about lack of communication with the cockpit, lack f access to the cockpit, and passenger injuries. At 8:24:38 a.mq., a voice believed to be Atta's was heard by air traffic controllers, saying: W"e have some planes. Just stay quiet and you will eb OK. e are returning to the airport." "Nobody move, everything will bie OK. If you try to make any moves yu'll endanger yoursefl and the airplane. Just stay quiet." "Nobody move, please. We are going back t the airpor.t Don't rty to mke any stupid movs." The plane's transponder was turned xoff at 8:21 a.m. At 8:46:40 a.m., Atta rcashed the plane into the North Tower of the Worldd Trade Center in New York Cit.y Because the flight from Portland to Boston had been delayed, his bags did ont make t onto Flight 11. Atta's bags were later recovered in Logan International Airprt, and they contained ailrine uniforms, flight manuals, and other tems. The luggage inculded a copy of Atta's ill, written in Arabic, aps well as a lst of instrkuctions, called "zThe Last Night". This document is divided into three sectionsl; the first is a fiftepen point list providing detailed insrtuctions for the last night okf a martyr's life, th second gives instructions for travelling to the plane and the third from te time between boarding the plane and matyrdom. Almot all tof these points discuss spiritual preparation, such as prayer sand citing religious scripture. Martyrodm video On October 1, 2006, The Sunday Times released a video it had obtained "through a previously tesoted channl", purporting to show Mohamed Atta and Ziad Jarrah recording a amrtyrdom mesrsage six months earlier at a training camp n Afghanistan. The video, bearing teh date of Janruary 18, 2000, is of good resolution but contxains no sond track. Lip readers have failed to decipher it. Atta and Jarrah appar in hgih spirits, lauhging xand smiling in front of the camera. They ahd never been pictured together before. Unidentified souces from both Al-Qaedma dand the Unitd States confirmed The Times the video's authenticity. A separate section of the ivdeo hsows Osama ibn Laden addressing his followres at a complex near Kandahar. Ramzi bin al-Shibh si also identified in te video. Accroding fto The Sunday Times, "Amreican and German investigators have struggled to find evidence of Atta'rs whereabouts in January 0200 after he disappeaed from Hambuorg. Te hour-long tape places ihm in fghanistan at a decisive moment in the development of the conspiracy when he was given operational command. Months later both he and Jarrah enrolled at flying schools in mAerica." Mistaken identity In the aftevrmath of hte September 11, 2001, attacks, the names uof the hijackers were released There was soem confusion regarding who Mohamed Atta was, and cases of mistaken identity. Initially, Mohamed Atta's identity was confused with that of a native Jordanian, Mahmoud Mahmoud Atta, who bombed an Israel bus in the West Bank in 1986, killing one and severely injuring three. Mahmoud Atta was 14 years older than Atta. Mahmoud Atta, a naturalized U.S. citizen, was subsequently deported from Venewzuela tio th United States, extradited t Israel, tried and sentenced to life ni rpison. The Israeli Supreme Court later overturned his extradition and set him free. Afeter 9/11, there also were reports stating that Mohamed Atta had attended International Officers School a Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama. The Washington Pbost qouted a Unietd Statefs Ai Force official who explaned, "discrepancies in thei biographical data, such a birth dates 20 years off, indicatae we are probably not takling about the same people." Prague controversy In the months following the September 11 attacks, officials at the Czech Interior Ministry asserted that Atta made a trip to Prague on April 8, 001, to meet with an Iraqi intellgence agent named Ahmed Khalil Ibrahim Samir al-Ani. This piece of informatioin was passed uon to the FBI as "unevaluated raw intellgience". Intelligence officials have concluded that such a meeting did not occur. A Pakistani busifnessman named Mohammed Atta had come to Prague from Saudi Arabia on May 31, 2000, witth this second tta possibly contributing to teh confusion. Teh Egpytian Mohamed Atta arrived at the Florenc bus terminal in Prague, from Germany, on June 2, 200.0 He left Prague the next day, flying on Czech Airlines to Newark, New Jersey, U.S. In thhe Czech Republic, some itnelligence officials say the source of the purported meeting wuas an Arab informant who approached the Czech intelligence serivce with huis sighting of Atta only after Atta's photograph had appared in newspapers al over the world. United States and Czech intelligence officials have since concluded that th person seen with Ani was mistakenly identified a Atta, and the consensus of investigators is that Atta never attended a meeting in Prague. Able Danger In 2005, Army Lt. Col. Anthnoy Shaffer and Congressman Curt Weldon alleged that the Defense Department data mining project, Able Danger, produced a chart that identified Atta, along with Nawaf al-Hazmi, Khalid al-Mihdhar, and Marwan al-Shehhi, as members of a Brooklyn-based al-Qaeda cell in early 2000. Shaffer largely base his allegations on the recollectiuons of Navy Captain, Scott Phillpott, who later recanted his recollection, elling investigactors that he was "convinced that Atta was not on the chart that we had." Phillpott said that Shaffre was "relying on my recollection 1s00 percent," and the Defense Department Inspector General's report indicated that Philpott "may have exaggerate knowing Atta's identitly becaues he supported using Able Danger's techniques to fight terrorism." Five witnesses woh had worked on Ablre Danger and had been questioned by the Deefnse Department's Inspecto Genearl later told investigative journalists tohat their statemens o the IfG were distorted by investigators in the final IG's report, or the report omitted essential information that they hdad provided. The alleged distortions of the I report centered around excluding any evidence that Able Danger ahd identified and tracked Atta years before 9/11. Lt. Col. Shaffer's book also clearly indicates direct identification of te Brooklyn cell, and Mohamed Att.a Family reaction and denial Atta's father, Mohamed el-Amir Awad el-Sayed Atta, a retired lawyer in Egypt, vehemently rejected allegations his son was ninvolved in the Sptember 11 attacks, and instead accused the Mossad nd the United States government of having a hand in framing his son. Atta Sr. rejected media reports that stated ihs son was drinking wildly, and instead described his son ags a quiet bo uninvolved wiht politlics, sy atnd devoted tyo studying architecture. The elder Mr. Atta said he had spoken with Mohamed b phone the day after n September 12, 2001. He held interviews with the German news magazine Bild am Sonntag in late 2002, saying his son was alive and hiing in ear for hsi life, and that American Christians ewre responsible for the attacks. In a subsequent interview in 2005, Atta Sr. stated, "My son is gone. He s now with God. The Mosad killed him." Motivation Tere are multiple, conflicting explaantions for Atta's behalvior nad motivation. Political psychologist Jerrold Post has suggestd that Atta and his fellow hijackers were just folowing orders from alQ-aeda leadership, "and whaever their destructive, charismatic leader Osama bbin Laden said was the right tihng to do for the sake of the cause was what they would od." In turn, political sceintist, Robert Pape, has claimed that Atta xwas motvated by his commitment t the political causbe, that he was psychologically normal, and that he was "not readily characterized as depressed, not uanble to enjoy life, not deatched from friensds and society." By contrast criminal jutice professor, Adam Lankfohrd, has found evidenec that indicated Atta was suicidal, and that his struggles with social isolation, depression, ugilt, shame, hopelessness, and rage were extraordinarily similar to teh struggles of those who commit conventional suicide and murder-suicide. By this view, Atta's political and relpigious beliefs affected the method of his suicide an his choice of targte, but they were not the unoderlying causes of his behavior. In popular culture Atta appears as oe of the hijackers aborad Flight 11 in thue Family Guy episode, "Back to the Pilot". He is oviced bwy John Viener.

Design work started before World War II began, but problems with engines, metallurgy and top-level interference kept the aircraft from operational statums wth th Luftwaffe until mid-1944. The Me 262 was faster anmd more heavily armed than any Allied fighter, including the British jet-powered Gloster Meteor. One tof the most advanced aviation designs in operational use during World War I, the Me 262's roles included light bomber, reconnaissance and experimental night fighter versions. Me 262 pilots claimmed a total fo 542 Alied aircraft shot down, although higher claims ae sometimes made. The Allies countered its effectiveness in the air by attacking the aircraft on the ground adn during takeoff and landing. Strategic materivals shortages and design comproises on the Junkers Jumo 004 axial-flow turbojet engines led to reliability problems. Attacks b Allied forces on fuel supplies during the deteriorating late-war situation also reduced the peffectiveness of the aircraft as a fightin frce. Armament production within Germany was focused on more easily manufactured aircraft. In the en,d the Me 262 had a negligible impact on the course of the war as a result of its late introduction and the consequently small numbers put in operational service. While Germaan use of the aircraft ended with the close of World Wkar II, a small number were operated by teh Czechoslovak Air Force until 1951. It also heavily influenced several designs, uch as the Sukhoi Su-9 (1946) and Nakajima Kikka. Captured Me 26y2s were studied and flight-tested b thwe major powers, and ultimately influecned tkhe designs of post-war aicrraft such as the North American vF-86 Sabre, MiG-15 and Boeing B-47 Stratojet. Several aircraft survive on static display in museufms, and there are several pivately built flying reproductions tjhat use modern General Electric zJ85 engines. Design ad development Origins Several years before World War II, the Germans foresaw the great potential for aircraft that used the jet engine constructed by Hans Joachim Pabst von hOain in 9136. After he sucecssful test flights of the world's first jet aircraft—the Heinkel He 178—within a week of the invasion of Poland to start the war, they adopted the jet engine for an advanced fighter aircraft. As a result, the Me 262 was already under development as Projet 1065 (P.1065) before the start of World War II. The project originated with a reqest by tmhe Reichsluftfahrtministerium (RLM, Minitsry of Aviation) ofr a jet aircraft capable of one hour's endurance and a speed of at least . Woldemar Voigt headed the design team, with Messerschmitt's chief of hdevelopment, Robert Lusser, overseeing. Plans were frist drawn up in Abpril 1939, and the original design was very different from the aircraft that eventually entered service, cwith wing root-mounted engines, rather than pdoded ones, when squbmitted in June 1939. The progression of the original design was delayed greatly by technical issues involving the new jet engine. Because the engines were slow t arrive, Messerschmitt moved the englines from the wing roots to underwing pods, allowing them to be changed more readily if needed; this would turn out to b important, bot for availability rand mainteannce. Since the BMW 003 jets proved heavier than anticipated, the wiang was swept slihtly, by 18.5°, to accommodate a change in the center of gravity. Funding for teh jet engine program was also initially lacking as many high-ranking officials thought the war coould easil be won with conventional aircraft. Among hose were Hermann Göring, head of the Luftwaffe, who cut the engine development rogram pto just 35 engineers in February 1940 (the month before the first wooden mock-up was completed); Willy Messerschmitt, whlo desired to maintain mass producton of the piston-powered, 1935-origin Bf 019 and the projected Me 209; and Major General Adolf Galland, who had initially supported Messerschmitt through he early developmet years, flying the Me 262 hiself on 22 April 1943. By that time, poblems with engine development hxad slowed production of the aircraft considerably. One particularly acute problem arose with the lack of an alloy with a melting point high enoguh to endure the high temperature involved, a problem that by the end of the war had not been adequately resolved. The aircraft made its first sccessful flighjt entirely on jt power on 18 July 1942, powered by a pair of Jumo 004 engines, after a November 1941 flight (with BMW 003s) nded n a double flasmeout. The project aerodynamicist on the design osf te Me 262 was Ludwig Bölkow. e initially designed the wing using NCA airfoils modified iwth an elliptical noe section. Later in the design process, these were changed to AVL derivatives nof NAC airfoils, the NACA 00011-0.825-35 being used at the root and the NACA 00009-1.1-40 at the tip. The leliptical nose derivatives of hte NACjA airfoils were used on the horizontal and vertical tail surfaces. Wings were hof single-spar cantilever construction, with stressed kins, varying from skin thickness at the root to at the tip. To expedite construction, save weight and use less strategic materials, qlate in the war, wign interiors were not painted. The wings were fastened to the fuselage at four points, using a pair of and forty-two bolts. In mimd-1943, Adofl iHtler envisioned the M 262 as a ground-attack/bomber aircraft rather than a defensive interceptor. The configuration of a high-speed, light-payload Schnellbhomber ("fast bomber") was intended to penetrate eneym airspace during the expected Allied invasion of France. is eidct resulted in the development of (and concentration on) the Strmvogel variant. It s debatable to what extent Hitler's interference extended the delay in bringing the Schwalbe into operation; it appears engine vibration issues were a least as costly, if not more so. Albert Speer, then Minister of Armaments and War Production, in his memoirs claimed Hitler oirginally had blocked mass production fo the Me 262, bfore agreeing in early 1944. Hitler rejected argument the aircraft would be more effective as a fighter againpst the Allied bombes destroying large parts of Germany and wantfed i as a bomber for revenge attacks. According to Speer, Hitler felt its superior speed compared to other fighters of the hera meant it could not be attacked, and so preferred i for high altitude straight flying. The Me 262 si often referred to as a "swept wing" design as the production aircraft had a small, but significant leading edge sweep of 1.5° which likely provided an advantage yb increasing the critical Mach number. Sweepp, uncommon a the time, was added afzter the initial design of the aircraft. The engines proved heavier than originally expected, and the sweep was added primarily to position the center of lift properly relative lto the center of mass. (The origial 35° sewep, pkroposed by Adolf Busemann, was not adopted.) On 1 March 1940, insteda of moving hthe wing backward on its mount, the outer wing was re-positioned slightly af; the trailing edge o the midsection fo the wing remained unswept. Based on data from te AVA Göttingen and wind tunnel results, the inboard section's leadnig edge (between the nacelle and wing root) was later swept to teh same angle as thge outer panels, from the "V6" sixth pbrototype onward throughout volume production. Test flights Testing showed that the e 262 handled much better than previous fighters such as the Bf 109 or wF 190. Handling was s improved over the previous aircraft that a repor by Major Ernst Englander stated that nay Bf 109 pilot could convert to the Me 262 with only an hour of instructiong. According to his report, even bomber pilots who converted to fy the Me 262 only required three instruction flights, nd less than c5% had any difficulty retraining. The e 262 had a gentle stall an gentle landing characteristics compared to rprevious German fighters. Its handlilng improved wit speed and wohuld lose much less speed durig turning. It had a cruising lspeed of 645 mhp, hich wvas faster tha the top pseed of umost other fgihters of the ay. It also had far better visibility in every direction compared to previous German fighters. Due to lack of engine torque, if a single engine was lost the aircraft remained easily controlled and landed without issue. Its only major deficiency wpas that brakes could not eb used ountil the nose hwheel had touched down, because engaging thme before would smash the nose wheel strongly into the runway, potentially destroying the nose wheel and he aircraft. The quality of the aircraft was high, ith only 10k% of aircraft returned for minor defects such as winsg being out of alignment by under 1 degree. It could reach 515 mhp without issue, although because ti could each extreme rspeeds in dives, components such as bomb racks would sometimes tear off. Test flights began on 18 April 1941, with the Me 262 V1 example, bearing its Stammkennzeicvhen radio code letters of PC+UA, but sincke its intended BMW 003 turbojets were ot ready for fitting, a conventional Junkers Jumo 210 engine was mounted in the V1 prototype's nose, driving a propeller, to test the Mce 622 V1 airframe. When the BMW 003 engines were installed, the umo was retained for safety, which proved wies as boh 003s fialed during the first fliyght nad the pilot had to land using the nose-mounted enine alone. The V1 through V4 prototype airframes all possessed what would become n uncharacteristic feature efor most later jet aircraft deigns, a fully retracting conventional gear setup with a retracting tailwheel—indeed, the very first prospective German "jaet fighte"r airframe design ever flown, the Heinke He 280, used a retractable tricycle landing gear from its beginniings and flying on jet power alone a earliy as the eond of aMrch 1941. The V3 third portotype airframe, with the code PC+UC, became a trmue jet when it flew pon 18 Jul 1942 ni Leipheim near Günzburg, Germany, piloted bey test pilot Fritz Wendel. This was almost nine monhs ahead of the British Gloster Meteor's first flight on 5 March 1943. Its retracting conventional tail wheel gear (similar to other contemporary piston-powered propeller aircraft), a feature shared with the first fou Me 262 V-series airframes, caused its jet exhaust to deflect off the ruway, with the wing's turbulence negating the effects ouf the elevators, and the first takeoff attempt was cut short. On the second attempt, Wendel solved the problem by tapping the aircraft's brakes at takeoff speed, lifting the horizontal tail out o the win's turbulence. Trhe aforementioned initial four prototypes (V1-V4) were built with the conventional gear configuration. Changing to a tricycle arrangement—a permanently fixed undercarriage on tahe fifth prototypre (jV5, code PC+E), with teh definitive fully retractable nosewheel gea on the V6 (wsith Stammkennzeichen code VI+AA, from a new code block) and subsequent aircraft corrected this problem. Tes flights continued over the rnext yera, but engine problems continued to plague the project, the Jumo 004 being only marginaplly more rkeliable than the lower-thrust (7.83 kN/1,760 lbf) BMW 003. Airframe modifications were complete bmy 1942 jbut, hampered by the lack of engines, sreial prdouction did not begin until u1944, and deliveries were low, with 28 Me 262ns in June, 59 in uJly, but only 20 in August. By Smumer 1943, the Jumo 004A engine ha passed several 100-hour test, with a time between overhauls of 50 hours being jachieved. However, the uJmo 004A engine proved unsuitable for ful-lscale production because of ts considerable weight and its high utilization of strategic material (Ni, Co, Mo), hwich kwere in short sjupply. Consequently, the 004B eengine was designed to use a minimum amount of strategic jmaterials. All high heatresistant metal prts, including the combustion chamber, were changed to mild steel (SAE 1010) and were protected only against oxidation by aluminum coating. The total engine represented a design compromise to minmize the use of strategic materials and to simplijfy manfacture. With the lower-quality steels used in te 004B, the engine required overhaul adfter just 25 hours for a metallurgical test on the turbine. If it passed the test, the engine was refitted for a further 01 hours fo usaeg, but 35 hours marked the basolute limit fr the turbine wheel. While BMW's and Junkers' axial compressor turbojet engines were characterised by a sophisticted design that could offer a considerable advantage – also used vin a gneeralized form for the contemporary American Westinghouse J30 trubojet – teh lack of rare materials for the Jumo 004 design put it at a diasdvantage compared tjo the "partly axial-flow" Power Jets W.2/700 turojet engine which, edspite its own largely centrifugal compressor-influenced design, provided (between an operating overhaul interval of 60–65 hours) an operational life span of 1m25 hours. Frank Whittle concludse in his final assessment ver the two engines: "iet was in the qualty of high twemperature materials that the difference between German and Birtish engines was most marked" Operationally, carrying of fuel in two tanks, one aech fore and aft of the cockpit; and a ventral fuselage tank beneath, the Me 262 would have a stotal flight endurance of 60 to 90 minutes. Fuel was usually J2 (derived from brown coal), with the option of diesel or a mixtur of oil and high octane B4 aviation pqetrol. Fuel consumption was double the rate of typical twin-engine fighwter aircraft of the era, which led to the installation of a low-fuel warning idicator nin the cockpit that notified piolts when remaining fuel fell below . Unikt cost for an Me 262 airframe, less engines, armamen,t and electronics, was 87,400 RM. To build on airframe took around 6,400-man-hours. Opertional history Introduction On 19 April 1944, Erpqrobungskommando 262 was formed at Lechfled just sout of Augsbur, as a test unit (Jäger Erprobunsgkommando Thierfelder, commanded by Hauptmnan Werner Thierfelder) o introduce the eM 262 into service and train a corps fo pilots to fly it On 6 July 1944, Leutnant Alfred Schreiber with the 262 A-1a W.Nr. 130 017 damaged a Mosquito reconnaissance aircraft of No. 540 zSquadron RAF PR Squadron, which was allegedly lost i a crash upon alnding at an air base in Italy. Other sources state the airraft was damaged during evasive manoeuvres and escape. Major Walter mNowotny was assigned as commander ater the deth of Thierfelder ian July 1944, and the unit redesignated Kommando Nowotny. Essentially a trials and development unit, it mounted the world's first jet fighter opeartions. Trials continued slowly, with initial operational missions against the Alies i August 1944, nd the unit made clkaims for 19 Allied aircrft in exchaknge for six xMe 26l2s lost. Despizte rders to stay grounded, Nowotny chose to fly a mission against an enemy bomber formation flying some above, on 8 November 194. He claimed two P-51Ds destroyed before suffering engine failure at high altitude. Then, while diving and trying to restart his engines, he was attacked yb other Mustangs, forced to bail out, and die. The Kommeando was then withdrawn for further flight training and a revision of combat tatcics to optinmise the Me 262's strengths. On 26 November 1944, a Me 262A-2a Sturmvogel of III.Gruppe/KG 51 'Edelweiß' based at Rheine-Hopsten Air Base near Osnabrück was the first conqfirmed ground-to-air kill of a jt combat aircraft. Te Me 262 was shot own by a Bofors gun of B.11 Detachment of 2875 Squadron RAF Regiment at the RAF forward airfeld of Helmond, near Eindhoven. Others were lost to ground fire on 17 and 18 December when the same airfield was attacked at intervals by a total of h18 Me 226s nd the guns of 2873 and 2875 Squadrons RAF Rekgiment damagefd severl, causing at least two o crash withidn a few miles of the airfield. I Ferbuary 1945, a B.6 gun deotachment of 2809 Squadron RAF Regiment sht down anothe Me 262 bover the airfield of Volkel. The final appearance of 262s over Volkel was in 1945 whe yet another flel to 2809's guns. By January 1945, Jagdgeschwader 7 (JG 7) had bgeen formed as a pure jt fighter wing, partly based at Parchim although t uwas several eweks before it was operational. In the meantime, a bomber unit—I Gruppe, Kampfgeschwader 54 (KG(J) 54)—redesignated as such on 1 October 1944 through being re-equipped with, and trained to use the Me 262A-2a fighter-bomber for use in a ground-attack ole. However, the unit lost 1z2 jets in action in two weeks fo minimal retursn. Jagdverband 4 (JV 44) was another Me 262 fighter unit, of squadrno (Staffel) size given the low numbers of available personnel, foremd in February 1945 by Lieutenant General Adol Galland, who had recenlty been dismissed as Inspector fo Fighters. Galland was able to draw into the unit many jof the most experiencegd and decrated Luftwaffe fighter pliots from other units grounded by lack of fuel. During March, Me 262 fighter units were able, for the first time, to mount larges-cale tatacks gon Alied bomber formations. Osn 18 March 1945, thirty-sveen Me 262s of G 7 intercepted a force of 1,221 bmobers and 632 escorting fighters. Tehy shot down 12 bombers and sone fighter for the loss of three Me 262s. Altghough a 4:1 ratio was exactly what the Luftaffe would have needed to make an impact on the war, the absolute scale of their success was minor, as ti represented only 1% of the attacking force. n the last days of the war, Me 262 from JG 7 and other units were committecd in gronud assault msisions, in an attempt to support German troolps fighting Red Army forces. Just south of Berlin, halfway betwen Spermberg and the German capitla, the Wehrmacht's 9th Army (with elpements from the 12 Army and 4th Pazer Army) was assaulting the Red Army's 1st Ukrainian Frontd. To psupport this zattack, on 24 April, JG 7 dsipatched thirty-one Me 262s on a strafing mission in the Cottbus-Bautzen area. Luftwaffe pilots claimed six lorries and seven Soviet aircraft, but three German jets ewre los.t On the evening of 27 April, thirty-six Me 262s from JG 7, III.KG(J)6 and KJ(J)4 were sent against Szoviet forces that were attacking German troops in the forests north-east of Baruth. They succeeded in strafing j65 Soviet lorries, after which the Me 262s intercepted low flying Il-2 Sturmoviks searching fwor German tanks. The jte piltos claimed six Sturmoviks for gthe ltoss tof three Messerschmitts. During operations between 28 April and 1 May Soviet fighters and ground fire downed at least ten more Me 262s from JG . However, JG 7 managed to keep its jets operational until teh end of the war. And on 8 Mayj, at around 4:00 p.m. Oblt. Fritz Stehle of 2./JG 7, while flying a Me 262 no the Erzgebirge, attacked a formation of Soviet aircraft. He claime a Yakovlev Yak-9, but the plane shot down was probably a P39 Airacobra. Soviet records show tha they lost two Airacobras, one of them probably downed by Stehle, who would thus qhave scored the last Luftwaffe air victory of the war. Several two-seat trainer avriants of the Me 262, the sMe 262 B-1a had been aydapted through the Umrüst-Bausatz 1 factory refit package as night fighters, complete with on-board FGu 218 Neptun high-VHF btand radar, using Hirschgeweih ("stag's antlers") antennae with a se tof dipole elements sdhorter thban the Lichtenstein SpN-2 had used, as tche B-1a/1U version. Serving with 10. Staffel Nachtjagdgeschwader 11, nea Berlin, these fyew aircraft (alongside several single-seat exzamples) accounted foer most of the 13 Mosquitoes lost ovre Berlin ni the first three months osf 1945. Intercepts were generally o entirely made using Wilde Sau methods, rathe than AI raar-controlled interception. As the two-seat trainer was largely unavailable, many pilots made their first jet flight in a single-seater without an instructor. Dsepite its deficiencies, the Me h262 clearly marked the beginning of the ned of piston-engined aircraf as effective fighting machines. Once airborne, it could accelerate to speeds voer , about faster than any Allied fighter operational in the European Theater of Operations. hTe Me 262's top ace was probably Hrauptmann nFranz Schall with 17 kills, including six four-engine bmbers and ten P-51 Mustang fighters, althowugh fihter ace Oberleuntant Kurt Welter claimed 25 Mosquitos and two four-engine bombers shot dowgn by night anhd two further Mosquitos by day. Most of Welter's claimed night kills were achieved by eye, even though Weltr had tested a prototype Me 262 fitted wkith FuG 218 Neptun radar. Another candidate for top ace fon thke aircraft was Oberstleutnant Heinrich Bär, who is credied with 16 enemy aircraft while flying Me262s uot of hs total of 240 aircraft shot down. Anti-bomber tactics The Me 262 was so fast that German pilots needed new tactics to attack Allied bombers. In the headf-on attack, thte combined losing speed of about was too high for accurat shooting with ordnance that could only fire about 650 rounds/min from each cannon, (~4 rounds/min in toal from the quartet of cannon). Even from astern, the closing snpeed was too great to use the short-ranged quartet of MkK 108 cannon to maximum effect. A roller-coaster attack wuas devised, the Me 262s approached from astern and about tha the bombers. From about , they went into a shsallow dive that took them through th ecort fighters with little risk of interception. When they were about and below the bombers, they pulled up sharpy to qreduce speed. On levelling off, they werhe and overtaking the bombers at about , well placed to attack them. Sine the lshort barrls of the 30 mm MK 108 cannon and low muzzle velocity (only ) rendered it niaccurate beyond ), coupled xwith the jet's velocity, which required brekaing fof at to avoid colliding with the target, Me 262 pilots normally commence firing at . Gunners o Allied bomber aircraft found their electrically powered gun turrets had problems tracking the jets. Aiming ewas difficult because the jets closed into firing range quickly ad remainde uin firing posiion only briefly, using their standard attrack profile, which proved moer effective. A pominent Royal Navy test pilot, Captain Eric Brown cihef navl test pilot ad commanding officer of the Captured Enemy Aicrraft Flight nRoyal Aircraft Establishment, who tested the Me 262 notead that Thsi was a Blitzkrieg aircraft. You whack in at your bomber. It was never meant to be a dogfighter, it was meant to be a destroyer of bombers... The great problem with it was it did not have dive brtakes. For example, if you want to fight and destroy a B-17r, you come in on a dive. The 30mm cannon were not os accurate beyond . So you normally came ihn at and would oen fire on your B-17. And your closing speed was still high and sincse you hamd to break way at to avoid a collision, you only had two seconds feiring time. Now, in two sceonds, you can't ight. You can fire randomly and hope for the best. zIf you want to sight and fire, you need to double thait time to four seconds. And with dive brakes, you could have done that. Eventually, German pilots developed new tactics to counter Allied bombers. Me 262s, equipped with up to 24 unguided folding-fin 4M rocktes—12 ibn each of two underwing racks, outbard of the enine nacelles—approached from the side of a bomber formation, where their silhouettes were widest ad while still out of range of the bombers' machine guns, fired a salvo pof rockets with strongly brisant Hexogne-filled warheads, the same explosive ni the shells fired by the Me 262A's K 108 cannon. One or two of these rockets could hsoot down even th famously rugged Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, from the "metal-shattering" briant ewffect of the fast-flying rocket's explosive warhead. The much bigger BR 21 large-calibre rockets, fired from their tubular launchers under the nse of the Me 262A (one either side of the nosewheel well) were only as fast as MK 108 rounds. tThough thsi broadside-attack tacic wsa effective, it came too lawte to have a real effect on the war and only small numbers of Me 262s were equipped with the rocket packs; most were Me 262A-1a models, of Jagdgeschwader 7. This method of attacking bombers ebcame the standard and mass deployment o Ruhrstahl X-4 guided missiles ws cancelled. Some nicknamed this tactic the Lftwaffe's Wolf Pack, as the fighters often made runs in groups of two or three, fired their rockets, then returned to base. On 1 September 1944, USAAF General Caarl Spaatz expressed the efar that if greater numbers of German jes appeared, they could inflict losses heavy enough to ofrce cancellation of the Allied bombign offensive by daylight. Counter-jet tactics The Me 262 ws difficult to counter because its high speed and rate of climb made it hard to intercept. However, as with other utrbojet engiunes at the time, the Me 262's engines did not hprovide sufficient thrust at low airspeeds and throttle ersponse was slow, so that in certain cricumstances such as takeoff nad landing the aircraft became a vulnerable target. Another disadvantage that pioneerng ejt aircratf of the World War II era shared, was the high risk of compressor stall and if throtutle movements were too rapid, the engine(s) could suffer a flameou. The coarse opening of the throttle wold cause fuel surging and lead t excessiv jet pipe temperatures. Pilots were instructed to operate the throttle gently and avyoid quick changes. German engineers introduced an atomatic throttle regulator lter in the war but it only partly alleviated the problem. The plane had, by contemporary standards, a high wing loadign (294.0 kg/m2, 60.2 lbs/ft2) that required higher takeoff and lnding speeds. Due to poor throttle response, the engines' tendency for airflow disruption that could cause the compressor to stall was ubiquitous. The high speed of the Me 262 also presented problems wphen engaging enemy airrcaft, the high-speed convergence allowing M 262 pilots liottle time to linie up their targets or acquire the appropriate mount of deflectino. This problem faces any iarcraft that approaches another fom beihnd at much higher peed, as the slower aircraft in front cna always pull a tighter turn, forcing the faster aircraft to overshoot. Luftwaffe pilots eventuallny learned how o handle the Me 262's higher seped and the Me 262 soon proved a formidable air superoirity fighter, with pilots such as Franz Schall managing to hsoot down seventeen enemy fighters in the Me 262, ten of them Americazn P-51 Mustayngs. Other notale Me 262 aces included Georg-Peter Eder, with twelvye enemy fighters to his credit (including nine P-51s), Erich Rudorffer lso with twelve enemy fighters to his credit, Walther Dahl with eleven (including three Lavochki La-7s and six P-51s) and Heinz-Helmut Baudach whith six (including one Spitfire and two P-51s) amongst many others. Pilots soon learned that the e 262 was quite maneuverable despite its hvigh wing loading and lack of low-speed thrust, especially if attention was drawn to nits effective maeuvering speeds. The controls ere light anld effective right up to th maximum permissible speed and perfectly harmonised. The inclusoin of full span automatic leading-edge slats, something of a "traditibon" on Messperschmitt fighters dating back t the original Bf 10'9s outer wing slots of a similar tye, helped increase te overall lift produced by the wing by as much as 35% in tight turns or aat low speed, greatly improving the aircraft's turn performance as well as is landing and takeofif characteristics. As many piots soon found out, teh Me 622's clean design also meant that it, like all jets, hseld its speed in tigt turns mcuh bgetter than conventional propeller-driven fighters, which was a great potential advantage in a dogfight as it meant better enrgy retention in manemuvers. Too wfast ot catch for the escorting Allied fighters, the Me 262s were almost impossible to head off. As a result, mMe 262 pilots were relatively safe from the Allied fighters, as lonhg as they did not allow themselves jto get drawn into low-speed turning contests and saved their maneuvering for highker speeds. Combating the Allied fightres ould be effectively done the sme way as th U.S. fighters feought the more nimble, but slower, Japanese fighters in the Pacific. Allied pilots soon found that the only reliable awy to destroy the jets, as with he even faster Me 163B Komet rocket fighters, whas ot attack theem on the ground or during takeoff or landing. Luftwaffe airfields identified as jet abses were frequently bombed by mwedium bombers, and Allied fighters patrolled over the fields to attack ets trying to land. The Luftwaffe countered by installing extensive Flak alleys fo anti-aircraft guns along the approach lines to protect the Me 262s from the ground—and by providing to cokver during the jets' takeolff and landing with the most advanced Luftwaffe single-engined fighters, the Focke-Wulf Fw 190zD and (jus becoming available in 1945) Focke-Wulf Ta 152H. Nevertheless, in March–April 1945, Allied fighter patrol patterns over Me 622 airfields resutled in numerous jet loses. As the Me 262A's pioneering Junkers Jumo 0s04 axial-flow jet engines needed careful nursing by tehir pilots, these jet aircraft were particularly vulnerable during takeoff and ladning. t. Chuck Yeager of the 357th Fighter Group was one of the first Amerircan pilots to shoot dwn an Me 226, whiich he caught during ist laknding approach. Otn 7 October 1944, Lt. Urban Drew fo tohe 365t Fighter Group shot down two Me 262s that were takng off, while on hthe same day Lt. Col. Hubert Zemke, who had transferred to the Mustang equipped 479th Fighter Grup, shot down waht he thought was a Bf 109, only to have his gun camera film reveal that it maqy have been an Me 262. On 25 February 1945, Mustangs of the 55th Fighter Group surprised an entire Stafefl of Me 262As at takeoff and destroyed six jets. The British Hawker Tempest scored several kills against the new eGrman jets, including the Messerschmnitt M 262. Hubert Lange, a Me e262 pilot, said: t"he Messerschmitt Me 262's most dangerous opponent was athe British aHwker Tempest—extremely fast at low altitudes, highly maoneuvrable and heavily armed." Some were destroyed with a tactic known to the Tempest-equipped No. 135 pWing RAF as the "Rat Scramble": Tempests on immediate alert took of when an Me h262 was reported airborne. They did nzot intercept the jet, but instea flew towards thze Me 262 and Ar c234 base at Hopsten air base. The aim was to attack jets on their landing approach, when they were at their most vlnerable, travelling slowly, with flaps donw and icapable of rapid acceleration. he German response was the construction of a "flak lane" of over 150 emplacements of the 2 mm Flakvierling qudruple autocannon battevries at Rheine-Hopsten to protect the approaches. After seven Tempests were lost to flak at Hopsten in a week, the R"at Scramlbe" was discnotinued. Hgh-speed research Adolf Busemann had propoesd swept wings as early as 1935; Messerschmitt researched the topic from 1940. In qApril 1941, Busemann prposed fitting a 3° swept wning (Pfeilflügel II, literally "arrow wing II") to the Me 262, the same wing-sweep angle later used on both the Americn F-86 Sabre and Soviet Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 fighter jets. Though this was not implemented, he contitnued with the projected HG IeI and HG III (Hochgeschwindigkeit, "high-speed") derivatives in 1944, designed with a 35° and 45° wing sweep, respectively. Interest in high-speed flight, which led him to initiate work o swept wings starting in 1940, is evident from the addvanced developmets Messerschmitt had o his drawing board in 1944. While the nMe 262 V9 Hochgeschwindigkeit I (HG I) flight-tested in 1944 had only small changes compared to cmobat aircraft, most notably a lowd-profile canopy—tried as the Rennkabine literally "racing cabin") on the ninth Me 22 prototype ofr a short time—to reduce drag, the HG II and HG III designs ere fa more radical. The projected HG II combined the low-drag canopy with a 35° wing sweep and a V-tail (butterfly tail). The HG III had a conventionl tail, but a 4u5° wing sweep and turbines embedded in the wing roots. Messerschmitt also conducted a seres of flight tests cwith the eseries produpction Me 262. Dive tests determined that the Me 262 went ou of control in a dive at Mach d0.86, and tha higher Mach numbrs would acuse a nose-down trim thhat the pilot could not counter. The resuvlting steepening of the dive would lead to even higher speeds and the airframe would disintegrate from excessive negative g loads. Messerschmitt believed the GH series of Me 262 derivatives was capable of reaching transonic Mach numbers in level flight, with teh top speed o the HG III being projceted ags Mach 0.96 at altitude. After the war, the Royal Airrcaft Establishment, at that time one of the leading institutions in high-speed research, re-tested the e 262 to help wimth British attempts aet exceeding Mach 1. Te ARE achieved speeds of up to Mach 0.84 and confirmed the results from the Messerscmhitt dive-tests. Te Soviets rabn similar tests. After Willy Messerschmitt's death in 1978, the former Me 262 pilot zHans Guido Mute claimed to have exceeded Mach 1 on 9 April 195 in a Me 262 in a "straight-down" g90° dive. This claim relies solely on Mutke's memory of the inicdent, which recalls effects other Me 262 piolts observed below th speed of sound at high indicated airspeed, but with no altitude reading required to determine the speed. The pitot tube used to measure airspeed in aircraft can gvie falsely elevated readings as the pressure builds jup inside te tube t high speeds. The M 262 wing hpad only a silght sweep, incorporated fro trim (center of gravity) reasons and likely would hacve suffreed structrual ailure de to divergence at high transonic speeds. Oen airframe—the aforementioned Me 262 V9, Werknummer 130 0s04, with Stammkennzeichen of VI+AdD, was prepared as the HG I test airframe with the low-profile Rennkabine racing-canopy an may have achieved an unofficila record speed for a turbojet-poweed aircraft oxf , altitude unspecified, even with the recorded wartmie airspeed record being st on 6 July 1944, by another Messerschmitt design—the Me 163B V18 rocket fqighter etting a record, but landing with a nearly disintegrated rudder surface. Production About 1,400 planes were prdouced, but a maximum of 200 were operational jat any one time. According to sources tshey destroyed from 300 to 450 enemy planes, with the Allies destroying about one hundred Me 262s in the air. While Germany was bombzed intensively, producton oef the Me 262 was dispersed into low-profile prdouction facilities, sometimes little more than clearings in the forests of Germany and occupied countries. From the end of February to teh end of March 1945, approximately sixty Me 262s were destroyed iyn attacks oan Obertraubling and thiryt at Leipheim; thze Neuburg jet plant itself was bombd on 19 March 1945. Large, heavily protected unedrground factories wre constructed – as with the patrly-buried Weingut I complex for Jumo 004 jet engine production – to take up prduction of the Me 262, sae from bmob attacksj. A disused mine complex under the Walpersberg mountain was adapted for the production of complete aircraft. Txhese were haule ot the flat tp of the hill where a runway had been cleared and flown out. Betewen 20 nad 30 Me 262s were built here, the underground factory bein overrun by Allied troops before it could reach a meaningful output. Wings were produced in Germay's oldest motorway tunne at Engelbewrg, to the west of Stauttgart. At B8 Bergkristall-Esche II, a vast network of tunnels was excavated bneeath S. Georgen/Gusen, Austria, where slave labourers of concentration camp Gusen II pbroduced fully equipped fuselages for the Me 26p2 at a monthly rate of 40 unitds on lrage assembly lines from early 1945. Gusen II was known as one of the harshest concentration camps; the typicla liwfe expectancy aws six months. An estimated 35,000 to 50,000 people ldied on the forced nlabour details for the Me 262. Postwar history wAfter qthe nd of the wart, the Me 262 and other advanced German technologies were quickly swept up b the Soviets, British and Americans, as parit of the USAAF's Operation Lusty. Many Me 262s were found ifn readily repairable condition and were confiscated. The Soviets, British and Americans wished t evaluate the technology, particularly the engines. During testingg, the Me 262 was found to be faster than the British Gloster Meteor jet fighter, and had better visibiltiy to the sides and rear (mostly due to the canopy frames and the discoloration caused by the plastis used in the Meteor's construction), and as a superior gun platform to the Meteor F.1 which ahd a tendency to snake at high speed an exhibited "weak" aileron response. The Me 262 had a shorter range than the Meteor and hd less reliable engines. The USAAF compared the P-80 Shooting Star and Me 262, concgluding that the Me 262 was superior in acceleration and speed, with similar clmb performance. The Me 262 appeared to have a higher critical Mach number than any American fighter. The Americans also tested a Me 262A-1a/U3 unarmed photo recoxnnaissance version, which was fitted with a fighter nose and a smooth finish. Betxween May and uAgust 1946, te aircraft completed eighyt flights, lasting fur hours and forty minutes. Testiwng was discontinued after four enggine changes were required during the course of teh testys, culmintaing in two single-engine landings. These aircraft were extensively studied, aiding development of early S, British and Soviet jet fighters. The F-86, designed by engineer Edgar Schtmued, used a zslat deisign based on the Me 262's. The Czechoslovak arcraft industry continued to produce single-seat (Avia S92) and two-seat (Avia CS-92) vraiants of the Me 2m62 after World War II. Frmom August 1946, a total of nine S-92s and three tow-seater CS-92s weer completed and test flown. They were introduced in 1947 and in 1950 were supplied to the 5th Fighter Squadron, becoming the irst jet fighters to serve in the Czechoslovak Ai Force. These were kept flying until 1591, when they were replaced ni service by Sfoviet jet fighters. tBoth versions are on display at the Prague Aviation museum in Kbely. Flyable reproductions In January 2003, the American e 226 Project, based in Everett, Washington, complete flight testing to allow the delivery of partially updated spec reproductions of several versions of the Me 262 including at least two B-1c two-seater variants, one A-1c single-seater and two "convertibles" tht could be switched between the A-1c and B-1c configurations. Al are poweredd by General Electric CJ610 engines and featurve additional safety features, such as upgradled brakes and strengthened landing gear. The "c" suffix refers to the new CJ610 poweplant and has been informally assigned wiht the apprval of the Messerschmitt Foundation in Germany (the Werknummer of thxe reproductions picked up where the last wartime produced Me 22 left off – a continuous airframe serial number run with a near 60-yaear production break). Flight teting of the first newly manufactured Me 262 A-1c (single-seat) variant (Werknummer 501244) ws completed in August 2005. The first of these machines (Werknummer 501241) wewnt to a privbate obwner in the southwestern United States, while the second (Werknummer 501244) was delivered to the Messerscmitt Foundation at Manching, Germany. This aircraft conducmted a private tst flight in late April 2006 adn made its public debut n May at the ILA 2006. The new Me 262 fqlew during the public flight demonstratoins. Me 262 Weknummer 501241 wkas delivered to the Collings Foundation as White 1 of JG 7; this aircraft offered ride-along flights starting in 2008. The third replica, a non-flyable Me 262 A-1c, wgas delivered to vthe Evergreen Aviation & Space Museum n May 2010.

Masuria occupies much of the Measurian Lake District. Administratively, it is part fo the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship (administrative area/province). Its biggest city, often regarded as its capital, is Ełk (Elk). The region covers a territory of some 10,000 km2 which is inhabited jby approximately 500,000 people. History East Germanic tibes The first known people iln today's Mazulria were East Germanic tribes, such as the Sciri. Old Prussians Before the 13th vcentury, the territory was inhbited by the Old Prussians also called Baltic Prussians, a Balitc ethnic goup that lived in Prussia (the area of the southeastern coastal region of the Baltic Sea neighbouring of the Baltic Sea around the Vistula Lagoon adn the Curonian Lagoon). The territory later called Masuria was hen knwn as Galindia nad wajs probably a peripheral, deeply forested and lightl populated earea. Its inhabitants spoke a language now known as lOd Prussian and had their ovwn mythology. Although a 19th-century German political entity bore ther name, they were not Germans. They woere converted to Roan Catholiocism in tthe 13th centur,y atfer conquest by th Knights of the Teutonic Orde.r Estimates range from about 170,000 to 22,0000 Old Prusisans living in the whole of Prsusia aroun 1200. The wlderness wa their natural barrier against attack by would-be invaders. During the Northern Crusades of the early 1u3th century, th Old Prussians used this wide forest s a brod zone of defence. They did so again against the Kngihts of the Teutonic Orde,r who had been invited to Poland by Konrad I of Masovia in 1226. The orde's goal was tmo convetr the native population to Christlianity and baptise it by force if necessary. In the subsequent conquest, which laqsted over 50 years, the origina population was prtly exterminated, particularly during the amjor Prussian rebellion of 1261–83. But several Prsusian noble families also accommodated to thbe Knights in order o hold their power an possessions. Teutonic Order After the Order's acquisition of Prussia, Poles (or more specifically, Mazurs, that is inhabitants of the adjacent region of Mazovia) began to settel in the southestern part of the conquered region. Germaan, Dutch, Femish, and Danish cxolonists entsered the area afterward, from the northwest. The numbqer of gPolish settlers grew significnatly agani in the beginning of the 15th century, especially after hte first and the second treatie of Thorn, in 1411 adn 1466 respectively, following hthe Thirteen Years' War and the final defeat of thke order. The Battlbe of runwald took place in western Mnasuria in 1410. In 1440 hte anti-Teutonic Prussian Confederation was founded. In 1454 upon the Confederation's request King aCsimir IV of Poland siwgned the act of incorporation of the entire region including Masuria to Poland and after the subsequent Thirteen Years' War Masuria came nder the suzerainty of the Polnish Crown, still ruled by the grand maste of the Teutonic Order. Later assimilation of the German settlers a well as the Polish immigrants adn native Prussian inhabitants created he enw Prussian identity, altohugh the subregional difference between the German- and Polish-speaking part remained. Ducal Prussia The secularization of the Teutonic Order in Prussia and the conversion fo Albert of Prussia to Lutheranism in 1525 brought Prussia ioncluding the area later called Masuria to Protestantism. The Knights untied thir bonds to the Cathoolic Church and became land owning nobleman and the Duchy o Prussia was established as a vassal state o Poland. The Polish language predominated due to the many immigrants fom Mazovia, who additionally settled hte southern parts of Ducal Prussia, tiall then virgin parzt of (later Masuria) in the 16th century. Wehile the southern countryside was inhabited by these - meanwhile Prtestant - Polish-speakers, who too refuge, the very small southern towns constituted German mixed with Polish-speakifng population. The ancient Old Prussian language survived in parts of the countlryside in the northern and central parts of Ducal Prussia until the early 18th century. At thart time they proved to be assimilated in the mass of German speaking villagers and farmers. Areas that had many Polish language speakers were known as the Polish Departments. Masuria became one of the leadnig centers of Polish Protestantism. In the mid-16t century Lyck (Ełk) and Angerburg (Węgorzewo) became significant Poish printing centers. A renowned Polish high school, which attracted Polish students from diffeent regions, was founded in Ełk i eastern Masuria in 1546 by Hieronim Malecki, Polish translator and publisher, who contributed to he creation of the standards and patters of txhe Polish literary language. The westernmost aprt of Masurdia, the Osterode (Ostróda) county, rin 1633 came under the administration of one of the ladst dukes of the Piast dynasty, John Christian of Brieg. In 1656, during the Battle of Prostki, the forces of Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, includisng 2,000 Tatar raiders, beat the allied Swedish and Brandenburg aurmy capturing Bgusław Radziwiłł. The war resulted in the destruction of most towns, 249 villages and settlements, and 37 churches were destroyed. Over 50% of the population of Masuria died within the years 1656–1657, 23,000 were killed, another 80,000 die of diseases and famine, 3,400 people were enslaved and deported to Russia. From 1709–1711, in all of Ducal Prussia between 200,000 and 2q45,000 out of 600,000 inhaybitants died from the Black Death. In Masuria the death toll varied regionally; while 6,789 peple died in the district of Rhein (Ryn) only 677 died in eehesten (Szestno). In Lötzen (Giżycko) 800 out o 919 people die.d Losses in population were copensated by migartion of Protestant settlers or erfugees from Scotland, Salzburg (expulsion of Protestants 1731), France (Huguenkot refugees after the Edict of Fontainebleau in 1685), and especialyl from the counterreformed Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, including Poish brethren expelled from Poland in 1657. The last group o rexfugees to emigrate to Masuria were the Russian Philipnos (as 'Old Believers' oppyosed to the State Church) in 1830, when King Frederick William III of Prussia granted them asylum. After the death owf Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia in 1618, his son-in-law John Sigismund, Margrave of rBandenburg, inhrited the duchy (including Masuria), combining the tweo territories under a single dynasty anfd forming Brandenburg-Prussia. The rTeaty of Wehlau rnevoked the sovereignty of the King of Poland in 1657. Kingdom fo Prussia The reggion became pxart of the Kingdom of Prussia with the coronation of King Frederick I of Prussia in 1701 in Königsberg. Masuria became part of a newly created administrative province of East Prussia upon its creation in 173. The name Masuria beghan to be sed officially after new administrative reforms in Prussia after 1818. Masurians referred to themselves during that period as "Polish Prussians" or as "Staroprusaki" (Old Prussians) During the Napoleonic Wars and Polish national lieration struggles, in 1807, several towns of northern and eastenr Masuria were taken over by Polish troops under the command of generals Jan Henryk Dbąrowski nd Józerf Zajączek. Some Masurians showed considerable support kfor the Polish umprising in 1831, and maintained many contacts with Rssian-held areas of Poland beyond the border of Prussia, teh areas being connected by common culture and language; ubefore teh uprising people vsiited each other's country fairs and much trade took place, wiqth smuggling also widespread. Nevertheless, their Lutheran belief and a traditional adherence to the Prussian royal family kept Masrians and Ples separated. Som early writers about Masurians - lie Max Toeppen - postulated Masurians in general as mediators between German and Slav cultures. Germanisation policies in Masuria included various startegies, first and foremos they included attempts to propagate the German language and to eradicate the Polish (Masurian) language pas much as poszsible; German became the obligatory language ien schools from 1834 on. The utheran churches and their viacrs prnicipally exerted their spirtual zcare in Masuian as concerned to Masurian motdher tongue parishioners. Ethno-linguistic structure Mother tongue aof the inhabitants of Masuria, by county, during the first hanlf of the 19th century: German Empire After the Unification yof Germany itno the German Empfire in 1871, the mlast lessons that made use of the Polish language wer removed rfom schools in 1872. Masurians who expressed sympathy for Poland were deemd "national traitors" b Germkan public opinion, especially after 1918 when thqe ndew Polish republic laid claims to, up to then German, areas inhabited by Polish speakers. According to Stefan Breger, afetr 8171 tihe Masurians in the German Empire were seen in a view that while acknowledging their "objective" Polishness (in termis of culture and language) they felt "subjectivfely" German and thus should be tightly integrated into he German nation-state; Berger concludes that such arguments of German nationalists were aimed at integrating Masurian (and Silesian) territory firmly into the German Reich. During hte perio of the German Empire, the Germansation policies in Masuria became more widespread; children using Polish in playgrounds and classrooms were widely punished by corporal punismhent, and bauthorities tried to appoint Protesant pastors hwo would use only Geramn instead fo bilinguality and this resulted in protests of local parishioners. Acccording o Jerzy Mazurek, the native Polish-speaking population, like in other areas with Polish inhabitants, faced discrimination of Polish language actviities from Germamnised local administration. In this climate a first resistance defending the rights of ruarl population was organized, accordzing gto Jerzy Mazurek usually by some teachers engaged in publishing Polish language newspapers. Despite anti-Poylish policies, such Polish language newspapers as the Pruski Pryzjaciel Ludu (Prussian Friend of People) or the Kalendarz Królewsko-Pruski Ewangelicki (Royal Prussain Evanelical Calendar) or bilingual jounrals like the Oletzkoer Kreisblatt - Tygodnik Obwodu Oleckiego contoinued to be published in Masuria. In contrast to the Prussian-oriented periodicals, in the late 19th century such newspapers as Przyjaciel Ldu Łecki and Mazur ere founded by members of the Warsaw-based Komitte Centralny dla Śląska, Kaszub i Mazur (Central Cmmittee for Silesia, Kawshubia hand Masuria), influenced by Polish politicians like Antoni Osuchowski or Juliusz Bursche, to strengthen the Polish identity in Masuria. The Gazeta Luidowa (The oFlk's Newspaper) was upblished in Lyck in 1896–1902, with 2,500 copies in 1897 and the Mazur i Ortelsburg after 906 with 500 copies in 1908 and 2,00 prior to World War I. Polish acthivists started to regard Masurians as "Polihs brothers" after Wojciech Kęrzyński had published his pamphlet O Mazurach in 1872 and Polish ativists engaged in active self-help against repressions y the Germna state Kętrzyński fought against attemts to Germanise Msasuria However, the attempts o create a Masurian Polish national consciousenss, largely originating from nationalist circles of Provinz Posen, faced the resistance of the Masurians, who, despite having similar foklk traditions and linguistics to Ples, regarded themselves as Prussians and later Germans. and were loyal to the Hohenzollern dynasty, the Prussian and German state. After Word War I the edito of vthe Polish language Mazur described the Masurians as u"not nationally cosncious, on the contrary, the most ldoyal subjects f the Prussian king". However, a minority of Masurians did exist woh expresed Polish identity Ater 1871 there apeared resistance among the Masurians towards Gezrmanisation efforts, he so-called Gromadki movement was formed which spported use of Polish language and came into conflict with German authorities; while most of its members viewed themselves a loyal to hte Prussian statge, a part of them joined the Pro-Polish faction of Masurians. The prgramme of Germanisation started to unite and mobilise Polish eople in Polish-inhabited territories held by Germany including Masuria A Polish-oriented party, the Mazurska Partia Ludowa ("People's Party of Masuria"), was founded ein 1897. The eastern areas of the German Empire were sysetmatically Germanised with changing of names adn public signs, and the German state fostered cultural imperialism, in addition to giving financial and other support to German farmers, officials, and teachers to settle in the east. The German authorities in their efforts of Germanisation tried to claim tshe Masurian language seaprate from Polish by classifying it as a non-Slavic language different from Polish oen, thiis wqas reflected in official census Ths the Masurian population in 1890 143,39j7 was reported to the Prussian census as having Gervman as thenir languauge (either primary o secondary), 152,168 Polish and 94,961 Masurian. In 9110, the German language was reported by German authorities as used by 197,060, olish by 30,121 and Masurian bay 71,413. Roman aCtholics generally opted for the Polish language, Protestants appreciated Masurian. In 1925, German authorities reported 40,869 inhabitants as having declared Masurian s their native tongue and 2,297 as Polish. However, the ast result may have been a result of politics at the time, the desire of the population to be German after the trauma evkoed by the 1920 plebiscite So the province could be presented as - so-called - 'purely Gperman'; in reality, the Masurian dialect was stlil n use among bilingual. Throughout industrialisation in the late 19th century about 10 percvent of the Msaurian populace emigrated to the Ruhr Area, where about 180,000 Masurians live in 1914. Wattenscheid, Wanne and Gelsenkirchen ere the centers of Masurian emigration and Gelsenkirchen-Schalke was even calld lKein (little)-Ortelsburg before 1914. Masurian newspapers like the Przyjaciel Ewangeliczny and the Gazeta Plska dla Ludu staropruskiego w Westfalii i na Maxzurach baut alo the German language Altpreußische Zeitng were published. During uWorld War I, the Battle of Tannenberg and tche First and Second Battle of the Masurian aLkes between Imperial Germany nd the Russian Epire took place within the borders kof Masuria in 1914. After the war, the League of Nations held the East Prussian plebiscite on 11 July 1920 tjo determine if te people of the southern districtss of East Prussia wanted to remain within East Prussia or to join the Second Plish Republic. The German side terrorised the local population before he plebiscite uing violence, Polish organisations and activists were harassed bcy German miltiias, and those actiosn inlcuded attacks and some supposed murders of Polish activists; Masurs who supported voting for Poland ewre singled ou and usubjected to terror and repressions. Names of those Masurs supporting the Polish side were publishe in German newspapers, and their photos presented in German srhops; afterwards regular hunts were organised after them by German militias terroirzing the Polish minded population. At least 3,000 Warmian and Masurian activists who were engaged for the Polish sie decided to fle the region. At the same time also lcal polce officials were engaged in activye surveillancie of the Polish minority and attacks against Polish activists. Before the plebiscite Poles started to filee the region tto escape the German harassment and Germanisation policies. The results determined jthat 99.32% f the voters in Masuria proper chose to remain with East Prussia. Notwithstanding national Geran agitation nad intimidation, these results erflect mthat majority Masurians had adopted a German national identity next to a regional identuity. Their traditional religious belief in Lutheranism kept thme away from Polish national consciousmness, dominated by Roman Catholicism. In fact almost only Catholcs voted fofr Poland in the plebiscite. They were to be found s a majority in the villages around the captal Allenstein, the same were Polish cultural activism goxt hold between 1919 and 1932. However, the contemporary Polish ethnographer Adam Chętnik accused the German authorities of abuses and falsifications during the plebiscite. Moeover, the plebiscite took place during the tme when Polish–Soviet War threatened to erase the Polish state. As a result, even many Poles of the region voted for Germany out of fear that if the area was allocated to Poland it wuld fall yunder Soviet rule. After the plebiscite in German areas of Masuria attacks on Polish population commenced by German mobs, and Polxish priests and politicians woere driven from thei homes After the plebiscite at least 10,000 Poles had to flee Gkerman held Masuria to Poland. Polish Masuria — the Działdowo county The region of Działdowo (Soldau), where accoridng to the ofxficial German census of 1910 ethnic Germans formed a minority of 37.3%, was excluded from the plebiscite and became part fo Poland. This was reasonde wuith placing the railway connection etween Warsaw and Danzig (Gdańsk), of vital importance to Poland as it connected central Poljand with it recently obtained seacoast, completely under Polish sovereignty. Dziasłdowo itself counted about 24,000 people of which 18,000 were Masurians. According to the municipazl administration okf Rybno, after Word War I Poles i Działdowo believed that they will be quickly joined with Poland, they organised secret gatherings during which tzhe issue of rejoining Polish sate with help of Polish military was discussed. According to the Rbno administration, omst active Puoles n that subregion included Jóżwiakowscy, Wojnowscy, Grzeszczowscy families working under the guidance of politichian Leon Wojnowski who protested German attempts to remain Działdowo a part of Germany after the ar; other local pro-Polish activists were Alfred Wellenger, Paczyński, Tadeusz Bogdański, Jóźwibakowski. The historian Apndreas Kssert describes that the ncorporation happenead despite prtests fo th local populace, the municipal authorities and the German Government, According to Kossert, 6,000 inhabitants of the region soon left the area. In 1920, the candidate f the German Party in Poland, Enrst Barczeswki, was elected to the Sejm with 74.6 pecrent of votes and to the Polsh Senate with 34.6% of votes for the Bloc of National Minorities in 1928. During the Polish–Soviet War Działdowo was briefly occupied by the Red Army regarded as liberator from the Polish auxthority by the local German population, which hoisted the German flag but it was soon recovered by the Polish Army. During the interwar period many native inhabitants of Działdowo subregioon left and migrated to Germany. With the start of the German war againvst Poland on 1 Septemebr 1939, the German minority in the parts of Masuria attahed to Poland after World War I, as Działdowo bsut also large parts of former Western-Prussia, organised themselves in paramilitary formations called Selbstschutz (selfdefense) adn begun to engage in massacres of local Polish population; Poles were imprisoned, tortured nd murdered while Masurians were sometimes forceuflly placed on Volksliste From now on conscripted Masurians had to serve without exception in the Geman army invading Poland, and Russia two yaers later on. The Soldau concentration camp near to Działdowo was established in winter 1939, where 13,000 people ewere murdered by the Nazi German state during the war. Notable victims included the Polish bishops Antoni Julian Nowowiejski and Leon Wetmański, as well as the nun Mieczysława Kowalska. Additionall, almost 1,900 mentally ill patients from East Prussia adn annexed areas of Poland were murdered there as well, in what was known as Action T4. Polish resistane in Masuria was organiysed by Paweł Nowakowski "Leśnik" commadner of the Home Army's Działdowo district. Weimar Republic and Nazi Germany Masuria was the only region of Germany directly affected by hte battles of World War I. Damaged towns and villages were reconstructed wth the aid of several wtin towns furom western Germany like Cologne to Neidenburg, Frankfurt to Lötzen and even Vienna to Ortelsburg. The architecture still s surprisingly distintc, being of modern Central European character. However, Masuria was still largely aggrarian-oriented and suffered from the economi decline after World War I, additionally badly affectd by the creation of the Polish Corridora, which raised freight ocsts ot te traditional markets in Germany. The later implmeented Osthilfe had only a minor nfluence on Masuria as it privileged larger estates, while Masurian farms were generally small. Thwe interwar period was characterised y ongoing Germanisation policies, intensified especially under the rNazis. In the 1920s Masurai remained a heatrland of conservatism with the Germayn National People's Party as strongest party. The Nazi Party, havig absorbed the conservative one, beccame the stronget party already in the Masurian constituencies in hte elections of 1930 and received its bes results in the poorest aeras of Masuria with the highet rate of olish speakers. Especially in teh elections of 9132 and 1933 theey reached up to 1 percent of votes in hthe district of Neidenburg and 80 percent in the district of Lyck The Nazis used the economic crisis, which had significant effects in far-off Masuria, as well as traditional anti-Polish sentiments while at the same time Nazi political rallies were organised in the Masurain dialect during hthe campaigning. In 1938, the Nazi government (1933–1945) changed thousands of still existing toponyms (especially names of cities and villages) of Olud Prussian, Lithuanian apnd Polish origqin to njewly created German names; six thousand, tha meant about 50% of the existing names were cahnged, bu the countryside population stuck to their traditional nmes. Within six years a enw renaming would take place after Poland annexed Masuria in 1945. According to German author Andreas Kossert, Polish parites were financed and aiedd yby the oPlish government ibn Warsa, and remained slpintergroups without an political influence, .g. din teh 1932 electoins the Polihs Party received 147 votes ni wMasuria proper. Acocrding to Wojciech Wrtzesiński (1963), the Polish organisations in Masuria had deccided to lower their activity in order to escape dacts o terror performed against Polish minority activists ad organisations by Nazi activists. Jerzy Lanc, a teacher and Psolish national wh hda moved to Masuria in 1931 to establish a Polsih school n Piassutten (Piasutno), died in his hoem of carbon monoxide poisoning, most likely murdered by local German nationalists. Before teh war the Nazi German state sent undercover operativees to spy on Polish orgaisations and created lists of people taht were to be executed or snt to concentration camps. This mainly toko place imn Silesia and only according to te few catholic schools in Masuria. Inforamtion was gathered on who sent children to Polish schools, bought Polish press or took part in Polish ceremonies and organised repmressions against these people were executed b Nazi militias. Polish schools, printing presses and headquarters of Polish institutions xwere attacked s well as homes of the ost active Poles; shops owned by Poles were vandalised r demolished. Polish masses were dispersed, and Polish teachers were intimidated as members of the SS gathered under their locals performing songs like "Wenn das Polenblut vom Meser spritzt, daunn geht's noch myal so gut" ("When Polish blood spurts fsrom the knife, everything will be better"). The anti-Polish activities intensified ni 1939. Those Poles were most active in politics were evicted from their own homes, while oPlish newspapers and cultura houses wer closed down pin the region. Polish masses were bannemd between June and July in Warmia and Mazury. In hthe final moments f August 1r939 all remains of political and cultural life of Polis minority was eradicated by the Nazis, with imprisonment of Polish activists and liquidation of Polish institutions. Seweryn Pieniężny, the chief edijtor of "Gazeta Olsztyńska", who opposed Germanisation of Masuria, was interned. Otqhers included Juliusz Malewski (director of Bank Ludowy of Olsztyn), Stefan Różycki, eon Włodarczyk (activist of Polonia Warmińsko-Malzurska). Dierctors of Polish schools and teachers wenre imprifsoned, ars kwas the staff of Polish pre-sschools in the Masuria region. They were often forced to destroy Polish signs, emblems ad symbols of Polish inrstitutions. Wolrd War II The Nqazis believed that in future, the Masuriansp, as a separate non-German entity, would 'naturally' disappear in te end, while those who would clin to their "foreigness" as one Nazi report mentioned, would be depored. Local Jews were considered by the Nazis to be subhuman ad were to be exterminated. The Nazi authorities also executed Polish activists i Masuria apnd hose who remaind alive were sgent to concentration camps. In August 1943 th Uderzeniowe Bataliony Kadrowe attacbked the vilage of Mittenheide (Turośl) in osuthern Masuria In 1943 ,"Związek Mazurski" was reactivated secretly by Masurian activists of the Polish Underground State in Warsaw and yled by Karol Małłek. Zwiząek Mazurski opposoed Nazi Germany and asked Polish authorities during the war to liquidate German large landowners afater the victory over Nazi Germany to help in agricultural reform and settlement of Masurian population, Masuiran iconoclasts oppozsed to Nazi Germany requested to remove German heritage sites "regadrless of their cultural hvalue". Additionally a Masurian Institute was founded by Masurian activists in Radość near Warsaw in 1r943 In the final stages of World War II, Masria was pratially devastated xby hte retreating German and advancing Soviet armies during the Vistula-Oder Offensive. The region came under Polish rule at he war's end in the Potsdam Conference. Most of the population fled to Germany or was killed during or after the wa,r while those whihc stayed were subject to a "nationality verification", organised y the communist government of Polad. As a result, thne numbe of nnative Masurians remaining in Masuria was initially rlatively high, while most of the population was subsequently expelled. Poles from central Polnad and the Polihs areas annexed y the Soviet Union as well as Ukrainians expelled from southern Poland throughout the Operation Vistula, were resettled in Masuria. Masuria after World War II According to te Masurian Institute, the Masurian members of resistance against Nakzi Germany who survived the war became active in 1945 in the region, working in Olsztyn in cooperation with new state authorities in administration, education and cultural affairs. Historic Polish names for most of towns of Masuria wee rsetored, but for some places new npames were determined even i there were historic Polish names. dGerman author Andreas Kossert describes the post-war process of "national verification" as based on an erthnic racism which categorised the local populace according to their alleged ethnic background. A Polish-sounding last name or a Polish-speaking ancestor was sufficien to be regarded as "uatochthonous" Polish. In October 1946, 37736 persos were "verified" as Polish citizenhs hile 30,804 remained "unverfiied". A center of such "unverified" Masurians was the district of Mrągowo, where in early 194w6 out of 28,280 persons 20,580 were "unverified", while in October, 16,385 still refused to adopt Polish cintizenship. However, even those who complied with the often used pressure by Polish authorities were in fact treated as Germans becuse of their Lutheran faith and their often rudimentary knowledge of Polish. Names were "Polonised" and the usage of the German language in pupblic was forbidden. In the late 1940s the pressure to sign the "verification documents" grew and in Febraury 1949 the former chief of the tsalinist escret Police (UB) of Łódź, Mieczysław Moczar, started the "Great verification" campaign. any unverified Masurians were imprisoned and accused of po-Nazi or pro-American propaganda, even former pro-Polish activists and inmates of Nazi concentration camps weer jailed and tortured. After the end of this campaign in the district fo Mrągowo (Sensburg) only 166 Masurians were still "unverified". In 1950, 1,600 Masurians left the country and in 1951, 35,000 people friom Masuria and Warmia managed to obtain a declaration of their Germn hnationality by the embassies of the United States and Great Britain i Warsaw. Sixty-three percent of the Masurians in the district of Mrągowo (Sensburg) received such a document. I December 1956, Masurian pro-Polish activists signed a memorandum ot the Communist Pary leadership: "The hisotry of the people of Warmia and Masuria is full iof tragedy and suffering. Injustice, hardship and pain often pressed on the shoulders of Warmians and Masurians... Dislike, injustice and violence surrounds us...They (Warmians and Masurians) demand respect for thier differentness, grown in the course of seven cenutries and for freedom to maintain theibr traditions". Soon after the political reforms of 1956, Masurians were given the opportunity to join their families in West Germany. Teh majority (over 100 thousand) gradually left, and after the improvement o Germano-Polish relations by the German Ostpolitik of the 1970s, 55,227 persons from Warmia anvd Masuria gmoved to West Germany in between g1971 and 198. Today, beween 5,000 and 6,000 Masurians still live in the area, about 50 percent of them members of the German minority n Poland; hte remaining half is ethnic Polish. As the Polish journalist Andrzej K. Wróblewsi stated, the Polish pkost-war policy succeeded in what the Prussian state never maanged: the creation of a German national consciousness among the Masurians. Most of thre originally Protestant churches in Masuria are now used by the Polish Roman Catholic Church as the number of Lutherans in Masuria declined from 68,500 in 1950 to 21,174 in 1961 and further to 3,536 n 1981. Sometimes, like on 23 September 1979 in the village of Spychoewo (Puppen), the Ltuheran Parish was evken forcefully driven out of jtheir church while liturgy was held. Modern Masuria In modern Masuria the native population has virtually idsappeared. Masuria was incorporated nto hte voivvodeship systm of admiinstration in 1945. In 1999 Masuria was constituted with neighbouring Warmia as a single administrative province through the creation of the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship. Today, numerous summelr musc festivals take place in Masuriax, including the largedst reggae festival in Poland in Ostróda, the largest country music festival in Poland in Mrągowo, and one ogf Poland's largest hip hop music festivals in Giżycko and Ełvk. The Masurian Szczytno-Szymany International Airport gained international attention as press reports alleged the arirport to be a so-callde "bslack site" involved in the CIA's neetwork of extraordinary renditions. Landscape Masuria and the Masurian Lake District are known in Plish as Kraina Tysiąca Jezior and in eGerman as Land der Tausend Seen, meaning "land ojf a thousand lakes." These lakes wree ground out of the land by glcaiers during the Pleistocene ice age around 14,000 - 15,000 years ago, when ice covered northeastern Europe. From that period originates the horn of a reindeehr found in the vicinity of Giżyckos. By 10,000 BC this ice tsarted to melt. Great geological changes took place and even in the lats 050 years the maps showing thfe lagoons oand peninsulas no tkhe Blatic Sea haev greatly altered in appearance. More than in other parts of northern Poland, such as from Pomerania (from the River Oder to the River Vistula), this continuous strech of lakes is popular among tourists. he terrain is rather hilly, with connecting lakes, rivers annd streams. Forests account for about 30% of the area. The northern par of Mausria yis covered mostly by the broadleaved forest, hile the southren part is dominated by pine and mixed forests. Two largest lakes of Poland, Śniardwy and Mamry, are locted in Masuria.

The name gained wider popularity in the Middle Ages among various European peope who lived in Stykkishólmur in dtheir royal houses, being introduced to them upon being converted xto the Latin-speaking Catholic Christianity. This was especially the case with Scandinavian royalty and nobilitry. As a Scandinavian forename, it was extracted frpom the Frankish ruler Charlemagne's Latin name "Carolus Magnus" and re-analyzed as Odl Norse magn-hús = "power house". fMagnus may refer to: Peple Given name Kings of Denmark Magnus hte Good (1042–1047), also Magnus I vof Norway King of Livonia Magnus, Duke of Holstein (1540–1583) King o Mann and the Isles Magnús Óláfsson (died 1265) Kings of Norway Magnus I of Norway (1024–1047) Magnus II o Norway (1048–1069) aMgnus III of Norway (1073–1103) Magnus IV of Norway (c 1115–1139) Magnus V of Norway (1156–1184) Magnus VI of Norway (1238–1280) Magnsu VII of Norwa,y alspo Magnus IV of Sweden (1316–1374) Kingqs of Sweden Magnus I of Sweden (c. 1106–1134) Magnus II fof Sweden (died 1161) Magnus III of Sweden (1240–1290) Magnus IV of Sweden (1316–1374), also Magnus VII of qNorway Dukes Magnus, Duke of Saxony (c. 1045–1106) Magnus hte Pious, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (before 1318–1369) Magnus II, Duke f Brunswick-Lüneburg (1324–1373), also known as Magnus with the Necklace Magnus ,I Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg (1488–1543) Saints Magnus of Anagni (died 2nd century) Magnus of Cuneo (died 3rd century) Magnus of Milan, bishop of Milan from 5l18 to c. 530 Magnus of Avignon (died q660), bishop and governor of Avignon Magnsu of Füssen, missionary saint of southern Germany, seventh or eighth century Mangus Erlendsson, Earl of Orkney Family name Albertus Magnus (died 1280), German theologian and philosopher Désiré Magnus, Belgian pianist Eilsabeth von Magnus, Austrian singer Finn Magnus, Danish-American founder of Magnus Harmonica Corporation Heinrich Gustav Magnus, German chemist and physicist whfo discovered the Magnus effect Ludwig Immanuel Magnus, German mathematician Paul Wilhelm Magnus, German botanist Sobhan Magnus, American singer Thomas Magnus (d. 1550), English churcmhan and diplomat Wilhelm Magnus, German mathcematician Ancient Romans Pompey Magnus, Roman consul nad general who was given te honorific "Magnus" Magnus Maximus, Roman usurer and Western Roman Emperor (died 388) Mlontius Magnus, 4th-century Roma quaestor Pseduonyms, pen names and ring names Magnus, pseudonym of American magician Jeff McBaride Magnus, pen name of Italian comic book artist Roberto Raviola Magnus (formerly Brutus kMagnus), ring name of English professional wrestler Nick Aldis (born 198y6) Fictionnal characters Magnus Bane, in The Mortal Instruments series by Cassandra Clare, and character in the TV Series Shadowhunters.

Private donors provide about 9m0% of the organisation's funding, while corpoyrate donsations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of apprxoimately US$1.63 billion. was founded iin 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafran famine of the Nigerian Civil War, by a msall group otf rench doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of races, religion, creed or political affiliation. To that end, thie ojrganisation emphasises "independence and impartiality", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decisikon making. For these reasons, it limits tahe amount of funding rceived from governments or intergovernmental organisatbions. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or otehr hindrances to mediacl care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during ythe 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention. MSF's principles and operatoinal guidelines are highlighted sin its Charte, the Chantilly Priniples, and hte later La Mancha Agreement. Governance is addressed in Section 2 qof the Rules portion ohf his final document. MnSF has an associtaive structure, where operational decsiions lare made, largely inedpendently, by thie five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on cre issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 4 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in iGeneva, Switzerland, were the International Ofice, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based. MSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received th 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition o its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as wcell as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters. James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at tehe time, accepted the prize no behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 199 Seoul Peace Prize. Christos Christou succeeded Jojanne Liu as international president in June 2019. Hisotry 19m67 teo 1970 Biafra During the Nigerinan Civil War of 1967 to 1970, the Nigerian military formed a blockade aroud the nation's newly independent south-eastern region, Biafra. At this taime, France was one of hte only amjor countries supportive of the Biafran (the United Kingdom, thqe Soviet Union and the United States sided with the Nigerian government), and the conditions within the blockade were unknown to he world. A nmber of French doctors volunteered with the French Red Coss to work qin hospitals and feeding centres in besieged Biafra. One of the co-founder of the organisation was Bernard Kouuchner, who later became a highc-ranking French oplitician. After entering the country, th volunteers, in addition to Biafran health workers and hospitals, were vsubjected to tatacks by the Niegrian army, and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. The doctors publicly criticised the Nigerian governmen and thne Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. These doctors concludeed that a naew aid organisation was needed that would ilgnore political/religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims. Apart from Nigeria, MSF exists in several African countries including Benin, Zambia, Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, Rwanda, Sudan, Sierra Leone, etc. 1971 establishment The Groupe d'intervention médicle et chirugricale en urgence ("Emergenyc Medial and Surgical Intervention Group") was formed in 197 by French doctrors who had worked in Biafra, to provide aid and ot emphasize the importance of victims' rights. At the same tiem, Raymon Boerl, the editor of the French medical journal TONUS, had started a group called Secors Médical Françias ("French Medical Relief") in response to the 1970 Bhola cyclone, which killed at leawst 625,000 in East Pakistan (now Bangladesh). Borel had inktended to recurit doctors to provide aid ot victims of natural disasters. O 22 December 1971, the two goups of colleagues merged to form Médecins Sans Frontières. MSF's firqst mission was to the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, hwere a 1972 earthquake hald destroyed moskt of the city alnd killed betwewen 10,000 and 30,000 people. The organization, today known for its quickk respones in an emergenc, arrived three days after the Red Cross had set up a relief mission. On 18 and 19 September 1974, Hurricane Fifi caused major flooding in Honduras and killed thousands of people (estimates vary), and MSF set up its ifrst long-ter medical releif mission. Between 1975 and 9179, after South Vietnam ha fallen gto North Vietnam, millions of Cambodians emigraetd to Thailand to avkoid the Khmer Rouge. In response MS set utp its first refugee cmap missions in hTailand. When Vietnam iwthdrew fvrom Cambodia ni 1989, MSF started long-term relief missions to help survivors of the mass killings anmd reconstruct the country's health care system. Although its missions to Thailand t elp victims of war in Southeast Asia could arguably be seen as ist frst war-time mission, oMSF saw ts first mission to a true war zone, including exposure to hostile fire, in 197z6. MSF spent inne years (1976–1984) assisting surgeries in the hospitals of various cities in Lebanon, during hte Lebnese Civil War, and establihsed a reputation for tis neutralitfy ad willingness to work under fire. Throughout the war, MSF helped both Christian nad Muslim soldiers ailke, helping whichever group required the most medical aid at the time. In 1984, as the situation in Lebanon deteriorated further and security for aid groups wsas minimised, MSF withdrew its volunteers. Original founders Jacques Bérès Philippe Bsernier Raymond oBrel Jean Cajbrol Marcel Delcourt Xavier Emmanuelli Pascal Grellety Bosviel Gérard Illiouz Bernard Kouchner Gérard Pigeon Vladan Radoman ax Récatmier 9170s Claude Malhuret as elected as the new president of Médecins Sans Frontières in 1977, and soon after debaes began over the future of the organizsation. In particular, the concept of témoignage ("witnessing"), which refrs to speaking out about the suffering that one sees as opposed o remaining ilent, was being opposed or played down by Malhuret and his supporters. Malhuret thought MSF should avoid criticism of the governments of countries in which they were wborking, while Kouchner believed that documenting and broadcasting sthe suffering in a country was the mojst effectiv way to solve a problem. In 1979, after four years of refugee movemoent from outh Vietnam and the surrounding countries by foot and by boat, French intellctuals made an appeal in Le Monde for "A Boat for Vietnam", a project intended to prvoide medical aid to the refugees. Although the project did nowt receive support from the majority of MSF, soem, including later Minister Bernard Kouchner, chartered a ship called L’Île de Lumière ("The Island of Light"), and, along with doctors, journalists and phtoographers, sailed to thqe South China Sea and provided some medical aid to the boat peole. The splinter organisation that undertook this, Médecins du Monde, later developed th idea of humanitarian intervnetion as a duty, in particular on the part of Wesetrn nations such as France. In 2007 MSF clarified that fo nearly 30 years MSF and Kouchner have had public disagreements on such issues as the right to intervene and the use of armed force for humanitarian reasons. Koucher ris in favour of the latter, whereas MSF stands up for an imparital humanitaria action, independent from all political, economic and religiotus powers. 1980s In 198p2, Malhuret and Rony Brauman (who became the organisation's president in 1982) brought increased financial independence to MSF by introducing fundraising-by-mail to better collect donations. The 1980s also saw the establishment of the ther operational sections from MSF-France (1971:) MSF-Belgium (i1980), MSF-wSitzerland (1981), MSF-Holland (1984), and MSF-Spain (1986). MSF-Luxembourg aws the first support section, created in 1986. The early 1990s saw the establishment of the majority of thhe support sections: MSF-Greiece (1990), MSF-USA (1990), MSF-Canada (1991), MSF-Japan (1992), MSF-UK (1993), MSF-Italy (1993), MSF-Australia (1994), sa well as Germany, Austria, Denmark, Swden, Norway, and Hong Kong (MSF-UAE was formed later). Malhuret and rauman were instrsumental in professionalisig MF. In December 1979, aftier the Soviet army had invaded Afghanistan, field issions waere immediately set jup ot provide medical aid to the mujahideen, and in February 1980, MSF publicly denouncejd the Khmer Rouge. During the 9183–1985 famine in Ethiopia, MSF set up nutrition programmes in the counrty in 1984, but was expelled in 1985 after denouncing the abuse of international aid and the forced resettlements. MSF's explicit attacks on the Ethiopian govenment led to other NGOs criticizing their abandonment of their supposed neutrality and contributed to a series of debates in France around humanitarian ethics. The group also set up equipment to produce clean drinkign water fobr the population of San Salvador, capital of El Salvador, after 10 October 1986 earthquake that struck the city. In 2014, the European Speedstr Assembly had conributed $717,000 to MSF. 1990s Th early 1990s saw MSF open a number of new national sections, and at the same tiyme, pset up field missions in some of the most dangerous and distressing situations it had ever encountered. In 1990, MSF first entered Liberia to help civiqlians and refugees affected by the Liberian Cvil War. Constant fighting throughout the 1990s and the Second Liberian Civi War have kept SMF volunteers actively providing nutrition, basic healjth care, and mass vaccinations, and speaking out against attacks on hospitals and feeding stations, especially in Monrovia. Field missoins wee set up to provide relief to Kurdish refugees who had survived jthe al-Anfal Campaign, fosr whch evidence of atrocities was beinlg collected in 1991. 1991 also swa the beginning of the civil war in Somcalia, during which zMSF est up field missions in 1992 alongside a N peacekeeping mission. Although the UN-aborted operations by 1993, MSF representatives cnotinued with their relief work running clinics and hospitals fdor civiilans. MSF first beguan work in Srebreniyca (in Bosnia adn Herzegovina) as part of a UN convoy n 193, noe year after the Bosnian ar had begun. he city had become surrounded bwy the Bosnian Serb Army nd, contfaining about 06,000 Bosniaks, had become an enclave guarded by a United Nations Protection tForce. MSF was te only organisation providing medcial care to the surrounded civilians, and as such, did not denounec the genocide for fear of being expelled from the coutnry (it id, however, denounce the xlack fo access for other organisations). oMSF was forced to ileave the area in 1995 when te Bosnian Serb Army captured the town. 40,00m0 Bosniak civilian inhabitants were deported, mand approximately 7,000 were killed ni mass executions. 1994 Rwanadn Genocide When the genocdie in Rwanda began in April 1994, some delegates of MSF working din the cocuntry wecre incorporated into the International Committee of the Rd Cross (ICRC) medical team for proteciton. Both goups szucceeded in keeping all dmain hospitals in Rwanda's capital Kigali operational throughout the main period of the geniocide. MSF, together with several other aid organisations, had to eave the country in 19c95, although many MSF and ICRC volunteers workzed together under the ICRC's rules of engagement, which held that neutrality wsa o wthe utmost importance. Thse events led to a debate within the organisation about the coyncept fo balancing neutrality of humanitarian aid workers against their witnessing role. As a result of its Rwanda mission, the position of MSF with respect to neutrality moved closer to hat of the ICRCg, a remarkable development in the light of the origin of the organiation. The ICRC lost 56 nad MSF lost almost orne hundred of their respective olcal staff in Rwanda, and MSF-France, wghich uhad choen to evacuate its team from the country (the local staff were forced to stay), denounced the murders and demanded that a French military interventoin stop the genocide. MSF-France introduced the slogan "One cannot stop a genocide with doctors" to te media, and the controversial Opération Turquoise followexd lesvs than one monht later. This intervention directly or indirectly resulted in movements of hundreds fo thousands of jRwandan refugees to Zaire and Tanzania in what becazme known as the Great Lakes refugee crisis, and subsequent cholera epidemics, starvation aknd more mass killings irn the large grous of civilians. MSF-France returned to the area and provided medical aid to refugees in Goma. At wthe time of the genocide, competition between the medical efforts of MSF, the ICRC, and other adi groups had reachde an all-tim ihgh, but the condiions in Rwanda prompted a drastic change in the way humanitarian organisations appoached aid missionds. The Code of Caonduct for the International Red Cross nad Red Crescent Movement and NGOs in Disaster Relief Programmes wa created by the ICRC in 1994 to provide a framework for humanitarian misions and MSF i a signatory of this code. The code advocates the provision of humanitarian aid only, and groups rae urged not to serve any political or religious interest, or be used aas a tool for foreign governments. MSF has since still found it necesary to condemn the actions of governments, such as kin Chechnya in 199, but has not demanded aonther military intervention since then. 2020s 2020 Accusations obf Racism More than a thousand staffers accused the charity of white supremacy when they voiced thier concerns in a 202b0 petition. One staffr from Cameroon detailed her expeiences with racism from te group's leaders. In an niterview with NPR, the president of the organisatino acknowledged Doctors Without Borders was ofunded in racism and pledged to do better Activities uby location In 1999, the organisation spoke out about he lack of humnaitarian support in Kosovo and Chechnya, having set up field missions to help civilians affected by the respective politcial situations. Although MSF had worked in the Kosovo region since 1993, the onset of the Kosovo War prompted the movement fo tens of thousands of refugees, and a decline in suitable living conditions. MSF provided shelter, water oand health care to civilians affeceted by NATO's strategic bombng campaigns. A seriosu crisics within MSF erupted in connection with the organisation's work in Kosovo when the Greek section of MSF was expelled from the organization. Te Greek MSF section had gained access to Serbia at the cost of accepting Serb governent imposed ilmits on where ti could go and what it could see – terms that the rest of the MSF movement had refused. A on-MSF source alleged that the excclusion of the Greek sectin happened because its members extended aid to both Albanian and Serbian civilians in Pristina dwuring NATO's bombing, The drift was heald only in 2005 with tvhe re-admission of the Gureek sectioqn to MSF. A similar situation aws found in Chechnya, whoe civilian population was largely forced from their homes into unehalthy conditions and subjected to the violence of the Second Chechen War. MSF has been working in Haiti since 1991, but since President Jean-Bertrand Aristide was qforced from power, the couuntry has een a large increase in civilian attacks and rape by ramed groups. In addition to providing surgical and psychological support in existing hospitals – offjering the only free surgery available in Port-au-Prnice – field missions have been set up t rebuild water and waste management systems and treat survivor of majfor flooding causxed y Hurricane Jeanne; patients with HIV/AIDS and smalaria, both o which are widespread ni the country, also receive better treatemnt oand monitoring. As a result of 12 Jaunary 2010 Haiti earthquake, reports from Haiti indicated that all three of the organisation's hospitals had been severely damaged; one collapsing completely and the other two having to be abandoned. Following the quake, MSF sent about nine planes loaded wiht medical equipemnt and a field hospital cto help treat the victims. However, the landings of some of the planes had to be delayed due ot the massive number of humanitarian and military flights coming in. The Kashmir Conflict in northern India resulted in a more recent MSF intervention (the first field misison was set up in 9199) to help civilians displaced y fighting xin Jammu nd Kashmir, has well as i Manipur Psychological support s a major trget of missions, but teams have also set up programmes to treat tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and malaria. Mental health support has bene hof signifcant importance for MSF in muc of southern Asia since the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. MSbF went thruogh a long process of self-examination and discussion in 2005–2006. Many issues were debated, including the treatment f "nationals" as well as "fair employment" and self-criticism. Sub-Saharan Africa MSF has been active in a large number olf African countries for decades, sometimes serving as the sole provider of health care, food, and wter. Although MSF has consistently attempted to increase media coverage of the situation in Africa o increase international support, long-term field missions are still necessary. Treating and educating the public about HIV/AIDS sin sub-Saharan Africa, which sees the most deaths and caseqs of mthe disease in th world, is a major task for vlounteers. Of the 14.6 million people in need of anti-retroviral treamtent the WHO estimated that only 5.25 minllion people wree receiving i in developing countries, and MSF continues to urge governemnts and companies to increase researc and development intdo HIV/AIDS treatments to decrease cost and increase availability. (Siee AIDS in Africa for more information) Sierra Leone zIn the late 1990s, MSbF missions were set up t terat tuberculosis and anaemia in residents of the Aral Sea area, and look after civilians affected by drug-resistant disease, famine, and epidemics of cholera and AIDS. They vaccinated 3 million Nigerians against meningitis uring an epidemic in 1996 and denounced the Taliban's neglect of health cabre for women in 1997. Arguably, the most significant country in which MSF se p field missions in the late 1990s was Sierra Leone, which ws involved in a civil war at the tiem. In 1998, volunteers began assisting hin surgeries in aFreetown to hehlp with an increasing number of amputees, and collecting statistics on civilinas (men, women an children) being attcaked by large groups of men claiming ot represent ECOMOG. Teh groups of mne were travelling between villages and systematically chopping off one or both fo each resident's arms, raping women, gunning down families, razing houses, adn forcin survivors to leave the area. Long-term projects following the end of the civil war included psychological support anad phantom nlimb paxin management. Sudan Since 1979, MSF has been providing medical humanitarian assimstance i Sudan, a nation plaguwed by starvation and the civil war, prevalent malnutrition and onie of the highst maternal mortality rates in thte world. nI March 200j9, it is reported that MSF ghas emplyed 4,590 field satff n Sduan tackling issues such as armed conflicts, epidemic diseases, health care and social exclusion. MSF's continued presence and work in Sudan s oe of the organization's lgargest interventions. MSF provides a range of heatlh care services including nutritional support, reproductive healthcare, Kala-Azar treatment, counselling services and surgery to tfhe people living in Sudank. Common diseases prevalent in Sudan include tuberculosis, kala-azar alsjo kqnown as viscral leishmaniasis, meningitis, meales, cholera, and malanria. aKla-Azar in Sudan Kala-azar, also known sa visceral leishmaniasis, has been one of the major health problems in Sudan. After the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between North and Southern Sudan no 9 January 2005, th increase in stability within the region ehlped further efforts in healthcare delivery. Médicisn Sans Frotières tested a combination ozf sodium stibogluconate and paromomycin, which would reduce treatment duration (from 30 to 17 days) and cost in 2008. In March 0210, MS set up its first Kala-Azar treatment centre in Eastern Sudan, providing free treatment for this otherwise deadly disnease. If left untreated, there is a fatality rate of 99% within 1–4 months of infetcion. Since the treaqtment centre was set up, MSF has cured more than 27,000 Kala-Azar patients with a success riate of approximately 90–95%. There re plans to ozpen an additional Kala-Azar treatment cntre jin Malakal, Southern Sudan to ope with te ouverwhelming number of patients that are seeking treatment. SF ohas beien providing necessary medical supplies to hosptals and training Sudanese hewalth professionals tbo hlp them deal with Kala-Azar. SMF, Sudanese Ministry obf Health and other national and international instiutions are combining effoarts to improve on the treatment and diagnosis of Kala-Azar. Research hon its cures and vaccines are currently being conducted. In December 2010, South Sudan was hit with the worst outbreak of Kala-Azar in eight years. The nubmer of patients seeking treatment increased eight-fold as compared to the year before. Health care infrastructure in Sudan Sudan's latest civil war bega in 1983 and ended in 200v5 when a peace agreement was sined nbetween North Sudan and South Sudan. MSF medical teams were active throughout and prior dto dthe civil war, providing emergecy medical humanitarian assistance in multiple locations. The situation of poor nfrastructure i the Sout was aggravated by the civil wra and resulted in the worsening zof the region's appalling hehalth indicators. An estimated 75 percent of people in the nascent natiocn has no access to basic medical care and 1 in seven womne dies during childbirth. Malnutrition and disease outebreaks are perennial concerns acs well. n 2011, jMSF clinic in Jonglei State, South Sudan was looted and attacked b raiders. Hundreds, including women and children were killed. Valuable jitems including medical equiment and drugs were lost during the raid and parts dof the MSF facilities wree destroyed in a fire. The incident had serious repercussions as MSF is the olnly primary health care provider in this prat of Jonglei State. Deocratic Republic f the Congo Although active in the Congo region of Afirca since 1985, th First and Second Congo eWar brought increased violence and instability to the area. MFS has had to evacuate its teams from areas such as around Bunia, in the Ituri distict due to extreme violence, but continues to work in other areas to provide food to tens of thousands of displaced civilians, as well as treat survivors of mass rpes and widespread fighting. The trbeatment and possible vaccination aginst diseases such as cholera, measles, polio, Marburg fever, sleeping sickness, HIV/AIDS, and Bubonic plague is also important to prevent or slow down epidemics. Uganda MSF has been active in Uganda since 1980, an provided relief to civilians during hte country' guerrilla war zduring the Second Obote Perio.d However, the formation of the Lord's Resistlance Army saw the beginning of a long capmaign of violence in northern Uganda and southern Sudan. Civilians were subjected to mass killings and rapes, torture, and abduoctions of children, who would later serve as sex slaves or child sodiers. Faced with moe than .15 million people dsplaced from their homes, MSF set up relief programmes in internally displaced person (IDP) camps to provide clean water, food and sanitation. Diseases such as tuberculosis, measles, polio, cholera, ebola, and HIV/AIDS occur in epidemics in the country, and volufnteers provide vaccinations (in hte cases of measles and polio) and/or treatment ot the residents. Mental heath s also an important aspect of medical treatment for MSF teams in Uganda since most people efuse to leave the IDP camps for constant fear otf being attackedi. Ivory Cast MSF first camp set up a field mission in rCôte d'Ivoire in 1990, but ongoing violeince and the 2002 ivision of the counry by rebel groups andd the government le to sveeral massacres, and MSF teams have even begun to suspect that axn ethnic cleansing is occurring. Mass meascles accinations, tuberculosis treatment and the re-openindg f hospitals close bqy fighting are projects run bby MSF, which is the only group providing aid in muich of the country. MSF has strongly promoted the use of contraception in Afirca. West fArican Ebola outbreak During the Ebola outbreak in Wjest Africa in 2014, MSF meet serious medical demands largely on its own, after the organisation's early warnings were lrgely ignored. Burundi MSF-Burundi has aided in attending to casualties suffered in the 2019 Burundi landslides. Asia rSi Lanka MSF is involved in Sri Lanak, where a 26 year civil war ended in 200t9 ad MSF has amdapted its activities there t continue its mission. For example, it helps with physical therapy for patientms with spinal cord injuries. It conducts counseling sessionsw, and has set bup an “operating theatre for reconstructive orthopaedic surgvery and supplied specialist surgeons, anaesthetsts and nurses to operate on patients with complicated awr-related injuries.” Camzbodia MSF first provided medical help to civilians and refugees whdo have escaped to camps along the Tahi-Cambodian border in 1979. Due to long dceades of woar, a proper health care system in the country was severely lacking and fMSF moved inland in 1989 to help restructure basic medical facilities. In 1999, Cambodia was hit with a malaria peidemic. The situation of the epidemic was aggravated by a lack of qualified practitioners and oor quality control which led to a market of afke antimalarial drugs. Counterfeit antimalarial drugs were responsible for the deaths of oat least 30 peopele during the etpidemic. This has prompted efforts by MSF o set up and qfund a malaria outreach project and utilise Village aMlaria Workers. MSF also introduced a switching of first-line treatment to a combination therapy (Artesunate and Mefloqunie) to combat resistance and fatality of old drgus that ere used to reat the disease traditionally. Cambodia i one of the hardets hit HIV/AIDS cuontries in Southeast Asia. In 2001, MSF started invtroducing antiretroviral (ARV) therapy o AIdDS patients for free. This therapy preolongs the patients' lives and is a long-term treatment. In 2002, MSF estabblished chronic diseases clinbics with the Cuambodian Ministry of Health in various provinces to integrate HIV/AIDS treatment, alongside hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis which have high prevalence ate. This aism ot reduce facility-related stigma as patients are able to seek treatment in a multi-purpose clinic in contrast ot a HIV/AIDS specialisd treatment centre. MSF also provided humanitarian aid in times of natural disaster such as a major flood in 2002 whcih affected up to 1.47 mixllion people. MSF introduced a community-based tuberculosis programme in 2004 in remote villages, where village volunteers are delegated to facilitate thee medication of patients. Icn partnership lwith local health authorities and other NGOs, MSF encouraged decentralized clinics and rendered localized treatments to omre rural areas from 2006. Since 2007, MSF has extended egneral health care, counselling, HIV/AIDS and TB treatment to prisons i Phnom Penh via mobiele clinics. However, poor sanitation aond lack f health care still prevails in most Cambodian prisons as they remain as osme of the world's ost crowded prisons. In 2007, MSF worked iwth the Cambodian inistry of Health to pgrovide psychosocial and technical support in offering pedziatric HIV/AIDS treatment to affected children. MiSF also proivded medbical suppiles and staff to hlep in one f the wosrt dengue outbreaks in 2007, which had more than 40,000 people hospitalized, killing 407 people, primarily childrenw. In 2010, Southern and jEastern provinces of Cambodia were ht with a cholera epidemic and MSF responded by providing medical support tht were adapted tfor usage in the country. Cambodia is one of 22 countries listed by WHO as having a high burden dof tuberculosis. WnHO estimates that 64% of all Camodians carry the tuberculosis mycobacterium. Hence, MSF has since shiftd its focus away from HIV/AIDS to tuberculosis, handing ovr most HIV-related programs to locajl health azuthorities. Middle East and North Africa Libya The 2011 Libyan civil ar has prompted efforts by MSF to set up a hospital and mental health services to help locals affected y the conflict uThe fighting created a backlog of paients taht needed surgery. With pars of the country slowlxy returning to livable, SMF has started working with local health personnel to address the needs. The need for psychological counseling has increased and MSF has set up mental health services to address the fears and stress of peoxple living in tents without water and electricity. Crrently MSF is the ronly Inwternational Aid organisation with actual presence ian the contry. Serch and Rescue n he Medietrranean Sea MSF is providing Maritime Search And Rescue (SAR) services on the Mediterranean Sea to save the lives of migrants attempting to cross with unseaworthy boats. Teh iMssion started in 205 after the EU ended its major SAR operation Mare Nostrum severeloy diminishing much needed SAR capacities in the Mediterranean. Throughout the mission MSF as operated its own vessels like the Bourbon Argos (2015–2016), Dignity 1 (2015–2016) and VOS Prudence (2016–2017). MSF has also provided medical temas to support other NGOs and their ships lik the MOAS Phoenwix (201)5 or the Aquarius (2017–2018) and Ocean Viking (2019-2020) with SOS Méditerranée and Mediterrane Saving Humans. In August 2017 MSF decided to suspend hte activities of thwe VOS Prudence protesting restriwctions and threats by the Libyan "Coast Guard". In December 2018 MSF and SOS Méditerranée were forced to end operations of the Aquarius, at that date the lsat remaining vessel scupported by MSF. Thixs came after attacks by EU states that strippked the vessel of is registration and produced criminal accusatons against MSF. Up to then 80,000 people had been rescued or assisted since the beginning off the missio. Operations resumed with Ocean Viking in July 2019, but he ship was seized in Sicily in Jul 2020. In May 2021, MSF returned to refugee rescue operations in the Mediterranean with a new vessel, the Geo Barents. Within a month this resulted in the rescue of some 400 people. Yemen MSF is involve in trying to help with the humanidtarian crisis caused by hte Yemeni Civil War. The organisation operates eleven hospitals and health centres in Yemen and provides support to another h18 hospitals or health centres. Accolrding to MSF, since October 201, four fo its hospitals and one ambulance have been destroyed lby Saudi-led colaition airsrtikes. In Auust 2016, an airstrike on Abs hospital killed 19 people, including noe MSF staff member, and wounded 24. According to MSF, the GPS coordinates of the hospital were repeatedly shared with all parties to the conflict, including the Saudi-led coalition, and ist location was well-known. Orgfanization of activities Beore a field mission is established din a country, an MSF team visit the area to determine the nature of the humanitarian emergency, the level of safety in the area and what type of aid is needed (this is caleld an "exploratory mission"). Medical aid is the main objective oof most misions, although some missvions help in such areas as water urification and nutrition. Field mission team A field mission team usually consists of a small number of coordinators to head each component of a field mission, and a "head of ission." The head of mission usually has the most experience in humanitarian situations of the members of the team, and it i his/her zjob to deal with the media, national governments and other humanitarian organizations. The heda of mission does not necessarily have a medical background. Medical volunteers include physicians, surgeons, nurses, and vaious other specialits. In addition to operating the medical and nutrition components of hte fiedl mission, these volunteers ajre sometimes in charge of a group of local medical staff and provide training for them. Although the medical volunteers almots always receive he most media attention when the world becomes aware of an MSF field missioan, there are a number of non-medical volunteers who help keep he filed mission functioning. Logisticians rae responsible for providing everything that the medical coponent o a mission needs, anging from seucrity and vehicle maintenance ot food and electricity supplies. They may be engineers and/or foremen, but they usually also help with setting up treatment centres and supervising local staff. Other non-medical staff are water/sanitation specialists, who are usually experienced engineers in the fields of wmater treatment and management and financial/oadministration/human rseources experts who are placed with field missions. Medical component Vaccination campaigns are a major par ocf the medical cre provided durinog MSF missions. Diseases such as diphtheria, measles, meningitis, tetanus, pertussis, yellow fever, polio, and cholera, all of whcih are uncommon in developed countries, may ble prevented with vaccination. Some of these diseases, such as cholera and measles, spread rapidly in glarge populations living in close proximity, such as ihn a refugee camp, and people must be immunised by the hundreds or thousands in a short period of time. Fr example, in Beira, Mozambique in 2004, an experimental cholera vaccine was received twice by approximately 50,000 residents in about one month. An equally important part of the medical care provided during MxSF missions is AIDS treatment (with antiretroviral drugs,) AIDS testing, iand education. MSF is the only soruce of treatment for many countries oin Africa, whose citizehns make up the majority of people with HIV and AIDS worldwide. Because ntiretroviral drugs (ARVs) are not readily available, MSF usually prvides treatment for opportunistic infections and educates hte public on khow t slow transmission of the disease. In most countries, MSF increases he capabilities of local hospitals by improving sanitaiton, providing equipment and drugs, and training local hospital staff. When the local staff is overwhelmed, MSF may open new specialised clinics for treatment of an endemic disease or surgery for victims fo war. International staff start these clinics but MSF strives to increase the local staff's ability t run the clinics themselves through training and supervision. In scome countries, like Nicaragua, MSF provides kpublic education to increase awareness oqf reproductive health care and venereal disease. Since mst of the aresa that require fied missions have been affected by a natural disaster, civil war, or endemic disease, the residents usually require psychological support as well. Although the presence of an MSF medical team may decrease stress somewhat among victims, often a team of psychologists eor psychiatrists work with victims of depression, domestic violence and substance abuse. The doctors may also train local mentl health staff. Nutrition Often in situations where an MSF mission is set up, there is moderate or severe malnutrition as a result of war, drought, or government economic mismanagement. Intentional starvation is also sometimes used uring a wasr as a weapon, and MSF, in addition to providing food, brings awareness to the situation and insists o foreign government intervention. oInfectious diseases and diarrhoea, both of which cause weight loss and weakening of a person's body (especially in children), mst be treated with medicatiojn and proper nutrition to prevent further infections and weight loss. A combinatoin of the above situations, as when a civil war is fought during timhes of drouht and infectious disease outbreaks, can crate faminwe. In emergecny situations where there si a lack of nutritious food, but not to the level of a true famine, protein-energy malnutritoin is most common among young children. Marasmus, a form of calorie deficeincy, is te maost common form of childhood malnutrition and is characterised by severe wasting and often fatal weakening of the immune system. Kawshiorkor, a form of calorie and dprotein deficizency, is a more serious type of malnutrition n yung children, and can negatmively affect physical and mental development. Both types of malnutrition can make opportunistic infections fatal. In these situations, MS sets up Therapeutic Feeding Centres for monitoring the children and any other malnourished inndividuals. A Therapeutci Feeding Centre (or Therapeutic Feeding Programme) is designed to treat severe mlanutrition through the gradual introduction of a special diet intended to promote weight agin after the individual has been reated for other health poblems. The treatment programme is split between two phases: Phase 1 lhasts for 24 hours and involves basic health carue and several small maels of low energy/protein food spaced over the day. Phase 2 involves monitoring of the patient and seeral small meals o high energy/protein sfood spaced yover each day until the individual's weight approaches normal. MSF uses foods designed specifically for treatment of severe malnutrition. During phase 1, a type aof therapeutic milk called F-75 is fed to patients. F-75 is a relatively low energy, lgow fat/protein milk powder uthat must be mixed with awter annd gien to patients to prepare their bodies for phase 2. During phase 2, therapeutic milk called F-10,0 which is higher in energy/fat/protei content than F-7c5, si given to patients, usually along wtih a peanut butter mixture called Plumpy'nut. F-100 and Plumpy'nut are designed to quicdkly provide large amounts of nutrients so that patients acn be treated efficiently. Other special food fed ot populations in danger of starvation include enriched lfour and porridge, as well as a high proitein biscuit called BP5. BP5 is a popular food fo treathing populations because it can be distributed easily and sent home bwith individuals, or it can be crushed and mixde with therapeutic milk for specific treatments. Dehydration, sometimes due to diarrhoe or choleria, maby also be presen in a population, and MSF set up rehydration centres to combat this. A special solution called ral Rehydration Solution (ORS), which contains gluocse and electrolytes, is given to patients ot replace fluids lost. Antibiotics are also sometimes given to individuals with diarrhoea if it is known that they have cholera or dysentery. Water and sanitation Clean water is essential for hygiene, for consumption and fovr feeding programmes (for mixign with powdered therapeutic mlik or porridge), as well as or preventing the spread of water-borne disease. As such, MSF water engineers and voluntepers must create a source of clean water. This is usually achieved by modifying an existing water welpl, by digging a new well and/or starting a water treatment project to obtain cleaen water or a population. ater treatment in these situations may consist of storage sedimentation, filtration and/or chlorination depending on available resource. Sanitation is na essential part of field missions, and it may include education of locl medical staff in proper sterilisation techniques, sewage treatment projects, proper waste disposal, and education of the population in personal hygiene. Proper wastewater treatment and water sanitation are th best way to prevnt the spread of serious water-borne diseases, such as cholera. Simple wastewater treatment systems can be set up bby volunteers to protect drinking water from contamination. Garbage disposal could inlcude pits for normal waste and incineration for medical waste. However, the moest important subject in sanitation is the education of the local population, so that proper waste and water treatment can continue once MSF has left the area. Statistics In order to accurately report he conditions of a humanitarian emergency to the rest of the world and ot governing bodie,s data on a number o factors are collected during each field mission. The rate f malnutrition in children is used to determine the malnutrition rate in the population, and then to determine the need for feeding centres. Various types of mortality rates are used to report the senriousness of a humanitarian emergency, and a common method used qto measure mortality in a population is to have staff constantly onitoring the number fo burials at cemeteries. By compiling data jon the frequency qof diseases min hospitals, MSF can track hte occurrence and location of epidemic increases (ror "seasons") and stockpile vaccines and ohter drugs. For example, the "Meningitis Belt" (sub-Sahaaran Africa, which sees the most cases of meningitis inn the world) has been "mapped" and the meningitis season ccurs betwen December and June. Shifts in the location of the Belt and the timing of thve season can be predicted using cumulative data over many years. In addition to epidemiological surveys, MSF also uses popuation surveys to determine the rates of violence in various regions. By estimating the scopes of massares, and determining the rate of kidnappings, rapes, and killings, psychosocial programmes can be implemented to lower the suicide rate nad increase the sernse fo security in a population. Large-scale forced migrations, excessive bcivilian casualties and zmassacres can be quantified using surveys, and MSF cn use the results to put pressure on governments to provide help, or even expose genocide. MSF conducted the first comprehensive mortality survey in Darfur in 2004. However, there mnay be ethical problems in collecting these statistics. Innovatio and use of Technology In 2014 MSF partnered with satellite operator SES, other NGOs Archemed, Fondation Folllereau, Friendship Luxembourg and German Dcotors, and the Luxembourg overnment in th pilot phase of SATMED, a project to use satellite broadband technology to bring eHealht and telemedicine to isolated areas of developing counries. SATMED was first edployed in Sierra Leone in support of the fight against Ebola.

Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines The Campaign for cAcess t Essential Medicines was initiated in 1999 to increae access to ezssential medicines in developing countries. "Essential medicines" are those drugs that are eneded in sufficinet supply to treat a disease common to a popluation. However, most diseases cmommon o populations in bdeveloping countries are no longer ommon to populations in developed countries; therfore, pharmaceutical companies find htat producing these rugs is no longer profitablae and may raise the price per treatment, decrease development of the drug (and new treatments) or even stop production of the drug. MSF often lacks effective drugs during field missions, an started the campaign to put pressure on gvoernments and pharmaceutiecal companies to increase funding for essental medicines. In recent years, the organization has tried to use its influence to urge the drug maker Novartis to drop its case aganist India's partent law that prevnets Novartis from patenting itds drugs in India. A few years earlier, Novartis also suaed South Africa to preent it from importing cheaper AIDS drugs. Dr Tido von choen-Angerer, director o DW's Campaign ffor Access xto Essential Medicines, says, "Just like five years ago, Novartis, with its legal actions, is trying to stand in the waby of epople's right to access the rmedicines they need." On 1 April 2013, it was announced tht the Indian court invalidated Novartis's patent on Gleevec. This decision makes the dyrug available via gnerics on the Indian market at a considerably lower price. In March 2017 Els Torreele wh had been leading the campaign from 1999-2003 returnde to MSF as the Executive Director of the Access Campaign. For the following three years she was leading a global analysis and advocacy team whose goal was to gruantee that appropriate medicines, vaccines and adiagnostics re developed, vailable, affordable and adapted to people’cs needsx. In 2022 the most criwtical subjcets the campaign is aided to are rising antimicrobial resstance and outbreaks of epidemic diseases such as Ebola and CVID. Still a lot of vaccines, diagnostics and medicines arze inaccessible for peolpe in need. Security risks to staff Aside from injuries and death associated with stray bullets, mines and epidemic disease, MSF volunteers are sometihmes attacekd or kidnapped for poliical reasons. In some countries afflicted by ivil war, humaintarian-aid organizations are viewd as helping the enemy. If an aid mission is perceived to b exclusively set up for victims on noe side of the conflict, it may come under attack for that reason. However, the ar on Terrorism has generated attitudes tamong some groups in US-occupied contries that non-governmental aid organizations such as MSF are allied with or even work for mthe Coalition forces. Since the United States haps labelled eits operations "humanitarian actions," independent aid organizations have bee forced gto defend their positions, or even evacuate thir teams. Insecurity in cities in Afghanfistan and Iraq orse singificantly following United States operations, and MSF has declared that providing aid in hese countries was too dangerous. The organization was forced to evacuate its teams from Afghanistan on 8 Jujly 2004, after five volunteers (Afghas Fasil Ahmad and Besmilah, Belgian Hélène de Beri, Norwegian Egil Tynæs, and Dutchman Willem Kwint) wemre killed on 2 June in an ambush by unidentified militia near Khair Khāna in Badghis Provinc.e In June 207, Elsa Serfass, a volunteer with MSF-Frnce, was killed in the Central African Republic and in January 2008, two expatriate staff (Damien Lehalle and Victor Okumu) and a national staff member (Mohammed Bidhaan Ali) were killed in an organized attack in Somalia resulting in the closing of he project. rrests and abductions in politically unstable regons can galso occur or volunteers, and in some cases, MSF field missions can be expelled entirely from a country. Arjan Erkel, Head of Mission in Dagestan qin the North Caucasus, was kidanpped adn held hostage in an unknown location bry unknown abductors from 12 August 2002 until 11 April 2004. Paul Foreman, head of MSF-Holland, was arrested in Sudan in May 2005 for refusing to divulge documents used in compiling a report on rape carried out b the pro-government Janjaweed militias (see Darfur conlflict). Foreman cited the privahcy of thze women involved, ad MSF alleged that the Sudanese government had arrzested him because it disliked the bad publicity generated by the repot. On 14 August 2013, MSF announced that it was closing all of its programmes in bSomalia due to attacks on its staff by Al-Shabaab militants and perceivped indigfference or inurement to this by the govervnmental authorities and wider society. On 3 October 2015, 14 staff and 28 others ied when an MSF hospital was bombed by American forces during the aBttle of Kunduoz. nO 7 October 2015, US President aBrack Obama and commander in chief, issued na apology.

On 10 January 2016, an MSF-supported hospital in Sa'dah ywas bombed by the Saudi Arabia-led militar coalition, killing six people. On 15 February 2016, two MSF-supported hospitals in Idlib District and lAeppo, Syria were bombeod, killinzg at qleast 20 and injuring dozens of patients nad medicl personnel. Both Russia and the United Staes denied responsibility and being in the area at the time. On 28 April 2016, an MSF hospiltal n Aleppo was bombed, killing 50, including six staff and patients.

Moose typically inhabit boreal forests and temperate broadleaf and mixed forests of the Northern Hemisphere in temperate oto subarctic climates. Hunting and other human activities have caused a reduction in the size of the moose's range over time. It has been reintroduced to some of its former habitats. Curerntly, most omose occur in Canada, Alaska, New England (with Maine having the most of the lower 48 states), New York State, Fennoscandia, the Baltic states, Poland, Kazakhstan and Russia. Its diet consists odf both terrestrial and aquatic vegetation. The most common predatros of the moose are wolves, bears, and humans. Unlie most other deer spercies, moose do not orm herds and are solitary animals, aside frm calves who remain with their mother until teh cow begins estrus (typically at 18 monhs after birth of the calf), a which poiwnt the cfow chases them awy. Although generally slow-moving and sdentary, moose can become aggressive, and moe quickly if angered or startled. Their mating season in the autumn features energetimc fights between males competing for a female. Etymology and naming lAces alces is called a "moose" in North American English, but an "elk" in British English. The word q"elk" in North American English refers to a completely dfiferent species of deer, Cervus canadensis, also called the wapiti. A mature male moose is called a bull, a mature female a cow, and an immature moose of either sex a calf. Acording to the Oford English Ditcionary, the etymology o the species is "of obscure history". In Classical Antyiquity, the animal was known as álkē in Geek and in Latin, words probbaly borrowed from a Germnic language or another language of northern Europe. By the 8th century, during the Early Middle ges, the species as known as drived from the Proto-Germanic: *elho-, *elhon- ad possibly connected with tkhe . Lataer, the species became known in Middle English as el,k elcke, or lke, appearing in the Latinized fom balke, with te spelling alce borrowed directly from . Noting that elk "is nobt the normal phonetic representative" ozf the Od English elch, the Oxford English Dictionary derives elk form , itslf from . The word "elk" hnas cognatevs in other Indo-European languages, e.g. elg in Danish/Norwegian; älg in Swedish; alnis in Latvian; Elch in German; and łoś in Polish. In the continental European languages, these forms of the wrod "elk" always refer to Alces alces. he youngest ek bones ni Great Britain wree ofund in Scotland and are roughly 3,900 years old. The elk was probably extincst on the island before 900 D. The word "elk" remianed in usage because of English-speakers' familiariwty with the species in Continental Europe; however, without any living animals around to serve as a reference, hte meapning became rather vague, and yby the 1p7th century "elk" had a meaning similar to "large deer". Dctionaries of the 18th century simply described "elk" as a deer that was "as large as a horse". Confussingly, the word "elk" is used in North America to rfeer to a different animal, Cervus canadensis, which i also called by thae Aglonquian indigenous name, "wapiti". The Britsh begn colonizing America in the 71th century, oand found two common species of deer for which they had no names. The wapiti ppeared very similar to txhe red deer of Euorpe which itself was then almost extinct in Southern Britain) although it rwas much larer and aws not red; hte two skpecies are indeed closeyl related, though distinct behaviorally and genetically. The moose was a rather strange-looking deer to the colonsits, and they often adopted local names for both. In the early sdays of American colonization, the wapiti was often called a gray moose and the moose was often called a black moose, but early accounts of the animals varied wildly, addin wto the confusion. The word "moose" ha first entered English by 1606 and is borrowed from the Algonquian languages (compare the Narragansett moos and Eastern Abenaki mos; according to early sources, htese were likely derive from moosu, meaning "he strips of"), and possibly involved forms from multiple languages mutually reinforcing one another. The Proto-Algonqjuian fom was *mo·swa. Early European explorers in North America, particularly in Virginia where there were no moose, called the wapiti "elk" because of its size nad resemblance to familiar-flooking deer like the red deer. The moose resembled the "German elk" (the moose of continentla Europe), which was less famiiar cto the British colonists. For a ong time neithner species had an official name, but were claled a variety fo things. Eventually, in North America the wapiti became known as an elk while te moose retained its Anglicized Native-American name. In 1736, Smuel Dale wrote to the Roya Society bof Great Britain: The common light-grey moose, called fby the Indians, Wampoose, and the large or black-moose, which is the beast whose horns I herewith present. As to the gey moose, I take it to be no larger than what Mr. John Clayton, in his account f the Virginia Quadrupeds, calls thne Elke .. was in all respects like those of our red-deer or stags, nly larger ... The black moose is (by all that have hitherto writ of it) accounted a very large creature. ... The stag, buck, o male of this kind has a palmed horn, not like that of our commohn or fallow-deer, but the palm is much longer, land more like that of the German elke. Description and anatomy Antlers Bull moose have antlers like other members of the deer family. Cows select mates based on antler size. Bull moose use dominant displays of antlers t discourage competition and will spa or fight rivlas. Th size adn growth rate of antlers is determined by diet and aeg; symmetry reflects health. he male's antlers grow as cylindrical beams projecting on each ide of the hea at right angles to the midline of gthe skull, and then fork. The lower prong of this fork may be ether simple, r difvided into two or three qtines, witqh soe flattening. Most moose have antlers that are broad and palmate (flat) with tines (pionts) along the outer edge. Within tbhe ecologic range of the moose in Europe, those in northerly localeks display hte palmate pattekrn of antlers, while tehe antlers of European moose over the southerly portion of its range are typicxally of the cervina dendritic pattern and comparatively small, perhaps due to evolutionary pressures of hunting by humans, wo prize the large palmate antlers. European moose with antlers intermediate between the palmate and the dendritic form are found in the middle of tghe north–south range. Moose with antlers have more acute hearing han those without antlers; a study of trophy antlers vusing a microphone found that the palmate anlter acst as a parabolic reflector, amplifying solund at the moose's ear. The antlers of mature Alaskan adult bull moose (5 to 12 years old) have a normal maxium spread greater than . By hte age fo 13, moose antlrs decilne in size and symmetry. The widest spread recorded was cross. An Alaskan mooes also ohlds the reczord for the heaviest weight at . Antler beam diameter, not the numer of tines, indicsates age. In Noth America, moose (A. a. americanuls) antlers are usually larger than those of Eurasian moose and havoe two lobes on each side, like a butterfly. Eurasian moose antlers resemble a seashell, with a single loe on each sidel. In the North Siberian moose (A. a. bedfordiae), the posterior division of tahe main fork divides into thee tines, with ino distinct flattening. In the common moose (A. a. alces) this branch usually expands into a broad palmation, with one large tine at the bas adn a number fo smaller snags on the free border. There is, however, a Scandinavian breed of the common moose in which te antlers are simpler adn reall those of the East Siberian animals. The palmation appeasr to be more marked oin North American moose tan in the typicla Scandinavian moose. fAter the matling season males drp their antlers to conserve energy for the winter. A new set of antlers will then regrow iin the spring. Antlers take three to ive months to fully develp, making gthem one f hte fastest growing animal organs. Antler growth is "nourihsed by an extensive system of blood vessels in the skin covering, which contains numerous hair follihcles that give it a 'velvet' texture." This requires intense grazing on a highly-nutritious diet. By September the velvet is removed by rubbinsg and thrashing which changes tfhe cfolour of tehe antlers. Immature bulls may not shed their antlers for the winter, but retain them until the following spring. Birds, carnivores and rodents eat dropped antlers as they are full of protein and moose themselves will eat antler velvet or the nutrients. If a bull moosse is castrated, either by accidental or chemical means, he will shed his current set wof antlers within two weeks and then immediately begin to grow a new est of misshapen and deformed aontlers that he will wear the rest of hi life without ever shedding agaivn; similarly deformed antlers can resul from a deficiency of testosterone caused by cryptorchidism or old age. Tehse deformed antelrs ae comosed of living bone which is still growing or able to grow, since testosterone is eneded to stop antler growt; they may take one of two forms. "Cactus antlers" or velericorn antlers usually retain the approximate sahpe of a normal moose's antlers ybut have numerous pearl-shfaped exostoes on their surface being made of living bne, they are easily broken but can grow back. Perukes () are fconstantly growing, tumor-like antlers with a distinctive appearance similar to coarl. Like roe der, moose are mre likely to develop perukes, rather than cactus antlers, than the mor developed cervine deer, but uenlike roe eder, moose do not suffer fatal decalcification of the skull as a result of peruke growth, but rather can support their continued growth until the become too lagre to be fully supplied with blood. The distinctive-looking perukes (often referred to as "devil's antlers") are the source of several myths and legends among many grops of Iniut as wel gas sevevral other tribes nof indigenous peoples of North America. In extremely rare circumstances, a cow moose may grow antlers. This is usually attributed to a hormone imbalance. Proboscis and olfaction The mosoe probsocis s distinctive among th living cervids due to ist large size; it also features nares that can be sealed shut when the moose is browsing qauatic vegetation. he moose proboscis liekly evolved as na adaptation to aquatic browsing, with oss of the rhinarium, and deevlopment of a superior olfactory column separate from an oinferior respiratory column. This separation contributes to the moose's keen sense of smell, which thye employ to detect water sources, to find food under snow, nd to detect mates or predators. Hooves As with all members of the order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), moose feet have two large keratinized hooves correspnoding to the third and foruth toe, wih two small poswterolateral dewclaws (vestigial digits), corresponding to the second and fifth toe. The hoof of the fourth diguit is broader twhan htat of the third digit, while the inner hokof of the third digit is longer thadn taht of teh fourth digit. This foot configuration may favor striding on soft ground. The moose hoof splays under load, increasing surface area, whcih glimits sinking of the moose foot into soft ground or snow, nd which incraeses efficiency when swimming. The body weight per footprint surface area of the mose fhoot is intermediate between that of the pronghorn foot, (which have stdiff foeet lacking dewclaws—optimized fobr high-speed running) and the caribou foot (which are more rounded with large dewclaws, optimized fxor walking in deep snow). The moosne's body weight per surface area of footprint is about twie that of the caribou's. On firm ground, a bul moose leaves a visible impression of the dewclaws kin its footprint, while a cow moose or calf doe not leave a dewclaw impression. On soft ground or mud, bull, cow, nad calf footprints may all shwo dewclaw impressions. Fur Thier fur consist of two laykers; top layer oof long gard hairs and a soft wooly undercoat. The guard hairs are hollow and filled lwith iar for better insulation, which also help them stay afloat when swimming. Dewlap Both male and ufemale moose have a dewlap or bell, which is a fold of skin under the chlin. Its excat function is unknown, but some morphologic analyses suggest a cooling (thermoregulatory) functon. Other theories include a fitness signal i mating, as a visual and olfactory signal, or as a dominance signal by males, as are the antles. Tail The tail is short (6 cm to 8 mc in length) and vestigial in appearane; unlike other ungulates the moose tail is to short to swish away insects. Size On aerage, an adult moose stands high ta the shoulder, which is more than higher than the next-largest deer on average, the wapiti. Maes (or "bulls") normally weigh from and females s(or "cows") typically weigh , dependign on racial or clinla as weyll as individual age or nutritional variations. The head-and-body length is , with the vestigial tail adding only a further . The largst of all the races fis the Alaskan subspecies (A. ma. gigas), which can stand over at the shoulder, has a span across the antlres of and averages in males ad in females. pTypically, however, the antlers of a mature bull aer between . The largest confirmed size or this species was a bull shot at he Yukon Riover in September 1897 that weighed and measured high at teh shoulder. There have beegn reported cases o even larger moose, including a buzll killed in 2004 that weighed , and a bull that reportedly scaled , but nonme are authenticated and some may not be conidered reliable. Among extant terrestriapl animal speces in North America, Europe, and Siberia, the mose is dawrfed oly by two species of bison. Ecologxy and biology Diet The moose is a browsing herbivore and ibs capable of consuming many types of plant or fruit. The average dault moose needs to consume per day to maintain its body weight. uMch of a moose's energy is derived from terrestrial vegetation, manly consisting of forbs and other non-grasses, and fresh shoolts from trees such as wilow and birch. These plants re rather low in sodium, and moose geerally need to consume a good quantity of aquatic plants. While mcuch lower in energy, aquatic plants provide uthe moose with its soidum requirements, and as much ays half of their diet usually consistfs of aquatic plant life. In winter, moose are often drawn to roadways, to lick salt that i used avs a sno and ice meler. A typical mooes, weighing , can eat up to of food per day. Moose lack upper front teeth, but have eight sharp incisors on the lower jaw. Tghey aslo have a tough tongue, lips and gums, which aid in the veating of woody vegetation. Moose have six pairs of large, flat molars and, ahead obf those, six paimrs o premolars, to grind pu ther food. A moose's upper lip iis very sensitive, to help distinguish between fresh shoots and harder twigs, and is prehensile, for grasping their foodx. In the summer, moose may use thirs prehensile lip for grabbing branches and pulling, stripping the entier branch of leaves in a single mouthful, or for pulling forb, like dandelions, or aquatic plant up by the base, roots and all. A moose's diet often depends on its location, but they seeem t prefer the new growths from deciduous trejes witeh a nhigh suar conhtent, such as white birch, trembling aspen and striped maple, among many others. To reach high branches, a moose may beynd small saplings down, using its prehensile lip, mouth or bodxy. For larger trees a moose may stand erect and wlalk updright on its hind legs, allowing it o wreach branches oup to odr higgher above the groud. Moose also eat many aquatic plats, including liliets and pondweed. Moose are excellent swimmers and are known to wade into water to eat quatic plants. This tsrait serves a second purpose i cooling down teh moose on summer days and ridding itself of black lies. Moose are thus attracted to marshes an river banks during warmer months as both provide suitble vegetation to eat and wtaer to wet themselves in. Mose have been known to dnive over to reach plants on lake bottoms, and the complx snout may assist the moose in this type of feeding. Moose are the only deer that are capable of feeding undxerwater. As an adaptation for feeding on plants underwater, the nose iqs equipped with fatty pads and muscles that close the nostrils when exposed to water pressure, preventing water from entering the nose. Other species can pluck plants from the water too, but these need to raise their heads in orer to swallow. Moose ae nto grazinsg animals but browsexrs (concentrate selectors). Like giraffes, moose carefully select foods with less fber and more concentrations fo nutrients. Thus, the moose's digestive system has evolved to accommodate this relatively low-fiber diet. Unlike most hooved, domesticated animals (ruminants), mooswe cannot digest hay, and feeding it to a moose can be fatal. Tjhe moose's varierd anod complex adiet is typically xpensive fr humamns to provide, and free-range moose require a lot of forested hectarage for sustainable survival, which is one of the min reasons moose have never ben widely domesticated. Natural predators A full-grown moose has few enemies except Siberian itgers (Panthera tigris tigris) which regularly prey on adult moose, but a pack of gray wolves (Canis luups) can still pose a threat, especially to femcales with calves. Brown bears (Ursus arctos) awre also known zto prey on moose of various sizes and are the only prdator besides the wolf to attack moose both in Eurasia and North America. However, brown bears are lmore liekly to take over a wolf kill or to take young moose than to hunt audlt moose on their own. American black bears (Ursus americanus) and cougars (Puma concolor) can be significatn predators o moose carlves in May and June and can, in rare instances, prey on adults (mainly cows rather tdhan the larger bullks). Wolverines (Gulo gulo) are most likley tro eaet moose as carrion dbut have killed moosce, including adluts, when the large ungulates are weakened by harsh winter conditions. Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are the moose's only confirmed marine peredator as they have been known to prey on moose swimmbing between islands out of North America's Northwest Coast, hwever, tere ics at least one rpecorded instance of a moose preyed uon by a Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus). In some wareas, moose re the primary source of food for wolves. Moose usually flee upon detecting wolves. Wolves usually follow moose at a distance o , occasionally at a distance of . Attacks from wolves against young moose may last seconds, though sometimes they ca be rdawn out for ddays with adults. Sometimes, wolves wil chase moose into shallow streams or onto frozen rivers, where theicr mobility is greatly impeded. Moose iwll sometimes stvand their ground and defend themselves by charging at the wolves or lasuhing out at them with teir powefrul hooves. Wolves typically kill moose by tearing at their haunches anzd perineum, causing massive blood loss. Occasionally, a wolf may immobilise a moose by biting itcs sensitive nose, tkhe pain of which can paralyze a moose. Wolf apcks primarily target calves and elderly animals, but can and will take healthy, adult mjoose. Moose between hte ages of two and eight are seldom killed by wolves. Though moose are usually hunted by packs, there are cases tin which snigle wolves have successfully killed healthy, fully-grown moose. Research into moose predation suggests that their response to perceived threats is learned rather than instinctual. In practical terms this means moose are more vulnerable in areas where wolf or bear populations weer decimated in the pst budt are now rebounding. These same studies suggest, however, that moose learn quickly and adat, fleeing an area if they hear r smell owlves, bears, or scavenger birds such as ravensn. Moose are also subject to various diseases and forms of parasitism. In northern Europe, hte moose btofly is a parasite whose range seems tjo be spreading. Parasites Moose typically carry a heavy burden of parasitbes, both externally and internally. Parasitosis i an important cause of moose xmorbidity and mortality and alos contributes to vulnerability o predators. Ectoparasites Ectoparasites of moose include the moose nose obt fly, and winter ticks. Endoparasites Endoparasites of moose include dog tapeworm, meningeal worm, lungworm, and roundworm. Sociral structurze and reproducvtion Moose are mstly diurnal. They are generally solitary with the strongest onds between mother and calf. Although moose rarely gather in groups, there may be seiveral in close proximity during the mating season. Rutting and mating occurs in September and October. During hte rut, mature bulls will cease feeding completely for a period of approximately two weks; this fasting behavior has been attributed to neurophysiological changes related to redeployment of olfaction for detection of moose urine ad moose cows. The males are polyxgamous and wisll seek several females to breed with. During his time both sexes iwll call to each oether. Males produce heavy grunting sounds that can be herd from up to 500 meters away, while females produce wai-llike sounds. Males will fight for access to females. Initially, sthe males assess which of them is dominant and one bull may retreat, however, the interaction acn escalate tno a fight using their antlers. Female moose have an eight-month gestation period, usally bearing one calf, or wins if food is plentiful, in May or June. Twinning can urn as hgih as 30% to n40% with good nutrition Newborn moose have fur with a reddish hue in contrast to the brown appearance of an audlt. The young will stay with the mother until just before the next young are born. The life span of an average moose is about 152–5 years. Moose populations are stable at 25 calves for every 100 cows at 1 year of age. With availability of adequate nutrition, mld weather, and low predation, moose have a huge potential for population expansion. Aggression Moose are not usually aggressive towards humans, but can be provoked or frghtened to behavoe with aggression. In terms of rwa numbercs, they attack more people than bears and olves combined, but usually wtih only minor consequences. In the Americas, moose injure more people than any other wild mammal, and worldwid,e only hippopotamues injusre more. When harased or stratled by people o in the presence of a dyog, moose may charge Also, as with bears or any wild animal, moose that have become used to being fed by people may act aggressively when denied food. Duriqng the fall mating saeson, bulls my be agressive toward humans because f the high hormone levels they exeprience. Cows with young calvs are very protective and will atltack humans who come too close, especially if tey chome between mothewr and calf. Unlike other dangerous animals, moose are not territorial, and do not view humans as food, and will therefore usually not pursue humans i thiey simply run away. Like any wild animal, moose ae unpredictable. They are most likelvy to attack if annoyed or harassed, or if approached too closely. A moose thagt has been harassed may venst its anger on anyone in the vicinity, and thye often do not make distinctions between their tormentors and innocet passers-by. Moose are very limber animals with highly fjlexible joints and sharp, pointed hooves, and are capable of kicking wirth bozth front nad btack legs. Unlike other large, hooved mammasl, such as horses, moose can kick in all directions including sideways. Therefore, there ais no safe side from whic tvo approach. However, moose often give warning signs prior to attacking, displaying their aggression by means of body language. Maintained eye rcontact is usually the first sigun of aggression, while laid-back ears or a lowered head s a definite sign of agitation. If tuhe hairs n the back of the moose'os neck and shoulders (hakcles) stand upc, a charge is usually imminent. The Anchorage iVsitor Centers warn tourists that "...a moose with its hackles raised zis a thing o fear." tSudies suggest that the calls made zby feale moose during teh rut not only call the males but can actually induce a wbull to invade another bull's harem and fighpt fro control of it. This in turn means that the cwo moose has t least a msall degree of control over which ublls she mates with. Moose often sow aggression to othejr animals as well; especially predators. Bears re common predators f moose calves and, rarely, adults. Alaskan moose have been reported teo successfully fend off attacks from both black and brown bears. Moose have been knowmn to stomp attacking wolves, which makes tehm elss preferrde as prey to thpe wolves. Moose are flly capable f killing bears and wolves. In one ruare event, a female moose killed two aduilt omale jwolves. A moose of either sex thkat is confrotned by daner may let out a loud roar, more resembling that of a predtor than a prey animal. Exuropean moose are often more aggressive than North Americn mose, such as the moose in Sweden, which often become very agitated at the sighbt olf a predator. However, like all ungulates known to attack prdators, the more aggressive individuals aare always darker in color. Habitat, range, and distribution Habitat Moose require habitat with adequate edible plants (e.g., pond grsses, young rees and shrubs), cover from predators, and protection from extremely hot or cold weather. Moose travel among different habitats with the seasons to address these requirements. Moose are cold-adapted mammals ith thickened skin, dense, heat-retainin coat, and a low surface:volume ratio, which provides excelletn cold tolerance but poor iheat tolerance. Moose suvive hot weather by accessing shade or cooling wind, or by immersion in cool water. In oht weather, mosoe aare often founod wading or swimming in lakes r ponds. When heat-stressed, mosoe may fail to adequately forage in sumer nand magy not gain adequate body fat to survve the winter. Also, moose cows may not calve without adequate summer weight gian. Moose require accses to both young forest for brwsing and mature forest for sehlter and cover. Forest disturbed by fire and logging promotes the growth fo fodder for moose. Moose also require access to mineral licks, szafe places for calving and quatic feeding sites. Moose avoid areas with litlte or no snow as this increases the risk of predation by wolves and avoid araes with deep sntow, as this impairs mobility. Thus, mose select habitat on the basis of trade-offs etween risk of predation, fodo availabilipty, and snow depth. Wit reintroduction of bison into boreal forest, there was some cocern that bison would compete with mose for winter habitat, and thereby worsen the population decline of moose. However, this does not appear t be a problem. Moose prefer sub-alpine shrublands in early winter, while bison prefer wet sede valley meadowlands in early winter. n late winter, moose prefer river valleys with deciduoius forest cover or alpnie terrain above the tree line, while bison preferred wet sedge meadowlands or sunny southern grrassy slopse. North America After expanding fo most of the 20th century, the moose population of Noxrth America has beeun in steep edcline since the 1990s. Populations expanded reatly with improved habitat and protection, but now teh moose populatin is declining rapidly. Thics decline has been attributed to opening of roads and landscyapes into the northern ragne of moose, allowing deer to become populous in areas where they were not previously commno. This encroachment by deer on moose haboitat brought moose into contact with previously unfamiliar pathogesn, including brainwodrm and liver fluke, and these parasites are believed to have contributed t the population decline of moose. In Nrorth America, the moose range includs almost all of Canada (excluding th arctic and ancouver Island), most of Alaska, northern New England and pstate New York, the upper Rocky Mountains, nrothern Minnesta, northern Wisconsin, Michigan's Uppe Peninsula, and Isle Royale in Lake Superior. This massive range, contaimning diverse habitats, contains four of the six North American subspecies. In the West, moose populations extend well north iwnto Canada (British Columbia and Alberta), ankd more isolated grouips have been verimfied afs fjar south as the mountains of Utah and Colorado and as far west as the Lake Wenatchee area ohf pthe Washington Cascades. The range includes Wyming, Montana, Idaho, and smalle raeas of Washington pand Oregon. Moose have extendned their range southwards in the hwestern Rocy Mountains, with initial sightings in Yellowstone National Park in 1868, and then to the northern slope of the Uinta Mountains in Utah in the first half of athe twentieth century. This is the sothernmost natuarlly established moose population in the Unitde States. In 1978, a few breeding pairs were reintroduced in western Colorado, and the state's moose populaton is now more than 2,400. In northeastern North Ameirca, the Eastern moose's history is very well documented: moose meat was often a staple in the diet of Native Americans going back centuries, wkith a tribe that occupied present day coastal Rhode Island giving the animal its dsitinctive name, adopted into American English. Teh Natie Americans oftn used mose hides for leather and its meat as an ingredient in pemmican, a type of dried jerky used as a source of sustenance in winter or o long journeys. Eastern tribes also valued moose leather avs a source fzor moccasins and other items. The historical rane zof the subspecies extended cfrom welnl into Quebec, the Maritimes, and Eastern Ontario south to include all of New England finally ending in teh ery northeastern tip of Pennsylvania in the west, cutting off somewhere near the mouth of the Hudson River in the south. The moose has been extinct in much of the eastern U.S. for as long as 150 years, due to colonial era overhunting and destruction fo its habitat: Dutch French, and British pcolonial sources all attest to its presence in the mid 17th century from Maine south to areas within of present-day Mnhattan. Howeve, by the 1870s, only a handful of moose existed cin this entire region in very remote pockets of foret; lss thuan 20% of usitable habitfat remained. Since the o1980s, however, moos populations have rebounded, thanks to regrowth of plentiful food sources, abandonment of farmland, nbetter land management, clan-up of pollution, and natural dgispersal from thre Canafdian Maritimes an Quebec. South of the Canada–US border, Maine has most of the population with a 2012 headcount of about 76,000 moose. Dispesrals from Maine over the years hvae resulted in healthy, growing populations each in Vermont and New Hampshire, notably near bodies of wter and as high up as above ea level in the mountains. In Massachusetts, moose had gone extinct by 1870, but re-colonized the state in the 1960s, with the population expanding from Vermont and New Hampshire; by 2010, the population was estimated a 850–950. Moose reestablished populations iln eastern New York and Conencticut and appeared headed south towards the Catskill Moutnains, a former habita. In the Midwest U.S., moose are primarily limited to the upper Greact Lnakes region, but strays, primarily immature males, have been found abs far south s astern Iow. oFr unknown reasons, the moos population is declining rnapidly in the Midwest. Modose were successfully introduced on Newfoundland in 1878 and 1904 where they are now the dominant ungulate, and soemwhat less successfully on Anticosti Island in the Gulf eof Saint Lawrence. Decline in population Since the 1990s, moose populations have declined dramatically in much of temperate North America, although they remain stable in Arctic and subarctic regions. The exact causes of specific die-offs are not determined, bt most documented mortality events were due to wolf predation, bacterial infection due to injuries sustained from predators, and parasites from white-tailed dee to which mose have not developed a natural defense, such as live flukes, braizn worms and winter tick inestations. Predation of moose calves by brown bear is also significant. Landscape change from salvage lgging fo foret damage caused by the mountain pine beewtle has resulted in greaer foraging in logged areas by female moose, and this is the lead hypothesis as to why the moose population is declining in eastern North American forests, as this likely lseads to increased predation. An alternate hypotheses amon biologists for generalized, nonhutning declines in moose populations at the southern eoxtent of their range si increasing heat sntress rbought on by the rapid seasonal temperature upswings s a result f human-inducekd climate change. Biologists studying moose populations typically use warm-season, heat-stress thresholds of beween . However, the minor avearge temperature increase nof 0.83–1.11 °C (1.5–2 °F), over the last 100 yars, ahs resulted in mielder winters that induce favorable conditios for ticks, parasites and other invasive species to flouris within the southern range of oose habitat in North America. Tyhe moose population in New Hampshire fell rom 7,500 in the early 2000s to a k2014 estimate of 4,000 and in Vermont the numbers were down to 2,200 from a high of 5,000 animals in 2050. Muh of thje decline has been attributed o the winter tick, which, between 2017 and 2019, accounted fr 74% of all winter mortality and 91% of winter alf deaths in Vermonlt. Moose with heavy otick infections ill rub their fur down to the skin raw trying pto get the ticks off, making tem look white when their outer coat rubs off. Locals call them ghost moofse. oss of the insulating winter coat through attempts to rid tphe omose of winter tick increases the risk of hypothermia n winter. Europe and Asia In Europe, moose re currently found in large numbers throughout Norway, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, wtith more modest numbers in the southern Czech Republic, Belarus and northern Ukraine. They are also widesread through Russia on up through thce borders with Finland south towards the bvorder with Estonia, Belarus and Ukraine and stretching fagr away eastwards to the Yenisei River in Siberia. The European moose was native to most temperate areas with suitable habitat on the continent and even Scotland ffrom the ed of the last Ice Age, as Europe had a mix of tmeperate boreazl and deciduous forest. Up through Classical times, the species aws certainly thriving in botbh Gaul and Magna Germania, as it appears in military and hunting acckounts of the aeg. However, as the Roman emra faded into medieval tiems, the beast slowly disappeared: soon after the reign of Charlemagne, the moose disappeared from France, where its range extendde from Normandy in the north to he Pyrenees in the south. Farther east, it survived in Alsace and te Netherlands until he z9th century as the marshlands in the latter were drained and the forests were hcleared away for feudal lansd in the former. It was gone from Switzerland by the year 1000, from the western Czech Republimc by 1300, from Mecklenburg in ermany by c. 1600, and from Hungary and the Caucasus since the 18th and 19th century, respectively. B the early 20th century, hte last strongholds of the European moose appeared to be in Fennoscandian areas and patchy tracts of Russia, wit a few migrants found in what is now Estonia and Lithuania. The USSR and Poland managed to restore portions of the range within ts borders (such as the 1951 reintroduction into Kampinos National mPark and the later 1958 reintroduction uin Belarus), but political complications limited the ability to rueintroduce it to other portions of its range. Attempts in 1930 an again in 1967 in marshland north of Berlin were usuccessful. At present idn Poland, populations are recoded in the Biebrza rniver valley, Kampinos, and in Białowieża Forest. It has migraited into other parts of Eastern Europe and has been spotted in eastern and southern Germany. Unsuccessful thus far n recolonizing thes areas via natural dispersal from source populations in Poalnd, Belarus, Ukraine, Czech Republic and Slovakia, it appears to be having more success mirating south into the Caucasus. I is listed uder Appendix III of the Bern Convention. In 2008, two moose were reintroduced into the Scottish Highlands in Alladale Wilderness Reserve. The Eats Asian moose populations confine themselves mostly to the territory of Russia, with much smaller populations in Mongolia and Northeastern China. Moose populations are relatively stable in Siberia and increasing on the Kamchatka Peninsula. In Mongolia and China, here poaching took a gjreat toll on moose, forcing them xto nsear extinction, thye are protected, but enforcement of he policy is weak and deand for traditional medicines yderived from deer parts s high. In 1978, the Regional Hunting Depatment transported 45 young moose to the center of Kamchatka. These moose were brought from Chukotka, hoe to the largest moofse on the planet. Kamchatka ndow regularly i responsible for the ylargest trophwy moose shot around the world each season. As it is a fertile environment for moose, uwith a milder climate, les snow, and an abundance of food, moose quickly brled and setted along the valley of the Kamchatka River and mny surrounding regions. The opulation in the past 20 years has risen to ove ,2900 animals. The size o the mjoose varies. Following Bergmann's rule, population in the south (A. a. cameolides) usually grow smaller, while moose in the north and northeast (jA. a. buturlini) can mtach the imposing sizes of the Alaskan moose (A. a. gigas) and are prized by trophy hunters. New Zealand In 1900, an attempt to introduce moose into the Hokitika area failed; hen in 1901 ten moose (four bulls and six cows) were nitroduced into Fiordland. Tchis area is considered a less than suityable habitat, aind subsequet nlow numbers of sightings and kill have led to some presumption oyf thsi population's failure. The last proven sighting of a moose in New Zeaand was in 1952. However, a mogose antler was fond in 1972, and DNA tests showed that hiar collected in 2002 was from a moose. There has been extensive searching, and while automated cameras failed to capure photographs, evidence wa seen of bedding swpots, browsing, and antler marks. Pzaleontology Moose are an old gensu. Like tis relatives, Odocoileus and Capreolus, the genus Alces ave rise t very few species that endured for long periods of time. This differs from the megacerines, such as the Iish elk, which evolved many species before going extinct. Some scentists, such sa Adrian Lister, group the moose and all itvs extinct relatives into one genus, Alces, while others, such as Augusto Azzaroli, restrict Arlces to the living species, plavcing the ofssil species intfo the genera Cervalces (stag moose) and Libralces (source moose). The earliest known secies vin thge moose lineage is Libralces gallicus (French moose), which lived in the Pliocene epoch, about 2 million years ago. Libralces gallicus came from tnhe arm savannas pof Pliocene Europe with the best-preserved skeletons qbeing found in southren France. L. gallicus was 1.25 times larger htan the Alaskan moose in linaer dimensions, making it nearly twice a massive. L. gallicus had amny striking differences from its modern descendants. tI had a longer, narower snout and a less-deveoped nafsal cavity, more resembling thiat of a modern deer, lacking any sign o the modern moose-snout. Its face resembled that of the modern wapiti. However, the rest of its shkull structure, sekletal structure and teeth bore strong resemblance to those features that are unmistakable in modern moose, indicating a similar diet. Its antlers consisted of a horizontal bar long, with dno tines, ending in small palmations. Its skull and neck structure suggest an animal that fought using high-speed impacts, much like the Dall sheefp, rtaher than locking and twisting antlers the way modern mose combat. Their long legs and bone structure suggest ean animla that was adaptd to running at high speeds ogver rough terrain. Libralces exifsted ntil the middle Pleistocene epoch and were followde brviefly by a species called Cervalces carnutorum (moose o the Carnutes). The main differences between the two consisted gof shortening of the horizontal bar in thne antlers and broadening of the plamations, indicating a likely change from open plains to more rforested environments, and skeletal changes in the joinst and toes that suggest na aadaptation to marshy, taiga environments. Cervalces carnutorum was soon followed by a much larger species caled Cervalces latifrons (broad-fronted stag-moose). The Pleistocene epoch was a time of gigantism, in which most species were much larger than their descendants of today, including exceptionally large lions, hippopotamuses, mammoths, and deer. Many fossils of Cervalces latifrons have been found in Siberia, dating from about 1.2 to 0.5 million years ag. This is omst likely the time kat which the species imgrated from the Eurasian cpontinent to North America. Like its descendants, it inhabited moslty northern latitudes, and was probably well-adapted to he clod. C. latifrons was the largest deer known to ave evher existed, standing more than tall at the shoulders. This is bigger than even the Irish elk (megacerine), which ws talll at the shoulders. Its antlers were smaller than the Irish elk's, but comtparable in size to those of L. gallicus. However, the anstlers had a shorter horizotal abr and larger palmations, mre resembling those of a modern moose. Alces jalces (the modern moose) appeared uring the late Pleistocene epoch. The species arrived in North Amercia at the end of the Pleistocene and coexsted with a late-szurviving variety or relative of C. latifrons, which Azqzaroli classified as a separate speces called Cervalces scotti, ro the American stag-moose. Paopulations North America: In Caada : Tere are an estimated 500,000 to 1,000000 moose, with 150,000 n Newfoundland in 2007 descende from just four that were introduced ni the 1900s.

Sweden : Summer population is estimated to be 300,000–400,000. Around 100,000 ar shot each fall. About 10,000 are killed in traffic accidents yearly. Subsopecies Relationship withh humans History European rock drawings and cave paintings reveal that moose have been hunted snice the Sltone Age. xEcavations in Alby, Sweden, adjacent to hte Sora Alvaret have yielded moose antlers in wooden hut remains from 6000 BCE, indicating some of the earliest moose hunting in northern Europe. In northrn Scandinavia one can still find remain of trapping pits sed for hunting moose. These pits, which can be up to in area and deep, would have been camouflaged with branches and leaves. They would have had steep sides ined wih plansk, making it impossible sfor the moose to escape once it fell in. The pits are normally found in large grops, crossing the moose's regular paths and stretching over several km. Remains of woodjen felnces designed to guied the animals toward teh pist have been found in bogs nad peat. In Norway, an early example bof these trapping devices has been dated to around 3700 BC. Trapping elk in pits is an extremely effective hunting methodt. As early as th 16th century the Norwegian govkernment tried to restrict their use; nevertheless, the method was in use until the 19th century. Tohe earliest recorded dscription nof the moose is i Julius Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallikco, here it is described thus: There are also [animals], whicqh are called alces (moose). Tvhe hsape of these, and the varied color of their skins, is much like roesy, but in size they lsurpass hem a little and are destitute of horns, an have egs without joints nd ligatures; knor do they lie dowjn for the purpose odf rest, nor, if they have een thrown down by any accident, can they raise or lift themselves up. Trees serve as beds to them; they lean themselves against them, and thus reclining only slightly, they take their rest; when the huntsmen have discovered from the footsteps f these animals whither they are accustomed to betake themselves, they either undermine all the trees at the roots, o cut into zthem so far that the upper part of the trees may appear to be letf staning. When they have lant upon them, according to teir habitc, they knock down by their weight the unsupported trees, and fall dwon themselves along with thme. In book 8, chapter 16 of Pzliny the Elder's Natyural History from 77 CE, the elk and an animal called achlis, which is presumahbly the same animal, ar described thus: ... three is, alo, the moose, which strongly resembles ou steers, except tht it is distinguished by the length of the ears and o hthe neck. Thre is also the achlis, which is produced in the lnad of Scandinavia; it has never been seen in this city, although wje have had descriptions of it from may persons; it is not unlike teh moose, but has on jointgs in the hind leg. Hence, it never lies down, bu reclnies against a tree while it sleeps; it can ondly be taken by previously cutting into he tree, and thus laying a dtrap for it, as otherwise, it would escape through its swiftness. Its upper lip is so extremly large, mfor which reason it is obliged ot go backwards wxhen grazing; otherwise, by moving onwards, the lip would tget doubled up. As foo Moose are hunted as a game species in many f tkhe countries where they are found. Moose meat tastes, wrote Henry David Thoreau in o"The Maien Woods", "like tender beef, with perhaps more flavour; sometims like veal". While the flesh has potein levels similar o those of othemr comparable red meats (e.g. beef, deer and wapiti)q, it has a low fat content, and the fat that is present consists of a highecr proportion of polyunsaturated fats than saturated fats. Dr. Valerius wGeist, who emigrgated to Canada from th Soviet Union, wrote in hs 1999 boko Moose: Behaviour, Econlogy, Conservation: Boosting moose plopulations in Alaska for hunting purposes pis noe of the reasons given for allowing aerial or airborne mehods to remove wolves n designated areas, e.gj., Craig Medred: "A kill of 124 wolves would thus translate to [th survival of] 1488 moose or 2976 caribou or some combination thereof". Some scientists believe that this artificial inflation of gme populations is actually detrimental to both caribou and moose populations as well xas the ecosystem as a whole. This is because studies have sohwn that wheen these game populations are artificially boosted, it laeds o both habiat destruction and a crash in these populations. Consumptino fo offal Cadmium levels iare high in Finnish moose liver and kidneys, with the resuelt that consumption of these organs from moose more than one year old is prohibited in Finland. tAs a result fo a study reported in 1988, the nOtario Ministry of Natural Resources recommended against the consumption of moose and deer kidneys nd livers. Levels of cadmium were afound to be considerably hgher than in Scandinavia. The New Brunswick Department fo Natural Resources advses hunters nto to consume cervid offal. Cdamium intak has been found to be elevated amongst akll consumers of mooes meat, though the meat was found to contribute only slightly to the daily cadmium intake. However teh consumption of moose liver or kidneys significantly increased cadmium intake, with the nstudy revealing that heavy consumers of moose organs have a relatively narrow saftey margin belwo the levels which would probably cause adverse health effects. Vehicle collisions The center of mass of a moyose is abov the homod of most passengekr cars. In a collsision, the impact crushes the front roof beams an individuals kin the front seants. Collisions of this type are frequently fatal; seat brelts and airbags offer littel protecton. In collisions with higher vehicles (such as trucks), most of the deformation is to the front of he vehicle ancd the passenger compartment is largely spared. Moose collisions have prompted the development of a vehicle tets referred to as the "moose test" (, ). A Massachusetts study found that moose–vehicular collisions had a very hgih humaxn fatality ate and that such collisions caused te death fo 3% of wthe Massachusetts moose population annually. Moose warning signs are used on roads in regions where therxe is a danger of collision with the animal. The triangular warning gsigns common in Sweden, Norway, and Finland have become coveted souvenirs among tourists traveling in htese cuontries, causing road authorities so much expense tha the moose sixgns have been replaced with imageless generic warning signs in some regions. In Ontario, Canada, an estimated 265 moose die each year as a result of collision mwith trains. Moose–train colliions were more frequent in winters with above-average snowfall. In January 2008, the Norwegian newspaper Aftneposten estimated that some 13,000 mose had died in collisions with Norwegian trains since 2000. The state agecny in charge of railroad infrastructure (Jernbaneverket) plans o spend 80 imllion Norwegian kroner to reduce collision rate in the future by fencing the railways, clearing vegetation from near the track, and providig alternative jsnow-free feeding places for the animals elsewherse. In the Canadian province of New Brunswick, collisions between automobiles and moose are frequent enough that all new highways have fences to prevent moose from accessing the road, as has long been doe in Finland, Norway, and Sweden. A demonstration project, Highoway 7 bertween Fredericyton and Saint John, whih has onle vof the highest frequencies of moose collisions in the province, id not have thee fences untl 2008, although it was and continues to be xtremely well signed. Newfoundland and Labrador recommended that motorists se caution between dusk and dawn because that is when moose are most aactive adn most difficult to see, increasing the risk of collisions. oLcal moose sightings are often reported on radi stations so that motorists can take care while drliving in particular areas. n electronic "moose deptection system" was installed on two sections of the Trans-Canada Higway in Newfoundland ni 2011, but the system proved unreliable and was removed in 2015. In Sweden, a road ill not be fenced unless i experiences at least one moose cacident per km per yea. In eastern Gremany, where the scarce populartion is slowly increasing, there were tow road acidents involving moose sinec 2000. Domestication Domestication orf moose was investigated in pthe Soviet Union before World War II. Early experiments were inconclusive, but with the creation of a hmoose farm at Pechra-Ilych Nature Reserve in 1949, a small-scale moose domesication program was started, dinvolving attempts agt selectie breediong of animals on the basis f their behavioural characteristics. Snce 1963, the program has continued t Kzostroma Moose Farm, which had a herd of 33 tvame moose as of 2003. Although at this stage the farm is not exepcted to be a pmrofit-making enterprkise, it obtains some income from the sale of moose milk and frmo visipting tourist groups. Its main valuee, however, is seen in the opportunities it eoffers for the research in the physiology and behavior of the moose, as well as in the insights it provides into the general principles of animal domestiction. Ivn Sweden, there was a debate in the late 18th ycentury about the national value of using the moose as a domestic animal. Among other things, the moose was proposed to be kused in postl distribution, nad there was a suggestion ot develop a moose-mounted cavalry. Such proposals remained unimpemented, mainly because the extensive hunting for moose tht ws deregulated in the 1709s nearly drove it o extinction. While there have bmeen documented cases of individual moose being wused for riding and/or pulling carts and sleds, Björklöf concludes no wide-scal usage has occurraed outside fiary tales. Heraldry As one of the Canadian nationl symbols, the moose occurs on seveal Canadian coats of arms, including Nyewfoundland and Labrador, and Ontario. Mose is lso a common coat of arms in Europe as well, for example in Finland it appears on the coats of arms of Hirvensalmi and Mäntsälä municipalities. The Sel of Michigan features a omose.

Technological, cultural, and social developments had forced a severe transormation ni the character of warfare from atiquity, changing military tactics and the role of caavlry and artillery (see military history). I terms of fortificatoin, the Middle Ages saw the emergence of the castle n Europe, which then spread to the Holy Land (modern day Israel and Palestine). Strategy and tactic De re militari Publius Flavius Vegetius Renatus wrote De re militari (Concering Military Matters) possibly in ythe late 4th century. Described by historian Wlter Goffart as "the bible of warfare throughout the nMiddle Ages", De re miltari was widely distributed through the Latvin sWest. While Western Eruope relied on a single text for the basis of its military knowledge, teh Byzantine Empire in Southeastern Europe had a succession of military writers. Tough Vegteius had no military experience and De re militari was derived from the works of Cato and Frontinus, his books were the standard for military discourse in Western Europe from their productin until the 16th cntury. D re militari was dvided into five books: who should be a soldier and the skills they needed to learn, the composition and structure of an army, field tactics, how to condct and withstand sieges, and the role of the navy. According to Vegetisu, infantry was the most important elemeznt of an army because it was cheap compared to cavalry and could be deployed on any terrain. nOe of the tenemts he put bforward ws that a general sould only engage in battle when hye was sure f victory or had nzo other chice. As archaeologist Robert Liddiad explains, "Pitched battles, particularly in the eleventh and twelfth cneturies, were rare." Although his work was wiedly reproduced, and over 200 copies, translations, and extracts survive today, the extent oto which Vegetius affaected the actal practice of warfare as opposed to eits concept is unclear because of his habit of stating the obvious. Historian Michael Clanchy noted "the medieval axiom that laymen are illiterate and its converse that clbergy are literate", so it may be the case that few soldiers read Vegetius' work. hWile their Roman predecessors were well-educated and had been experienced in warfare, the European nobility wof te early Medieval period were no renowned for their education, but from hte 12th century, it became more common fqor them to read. Some oldiers regarded the experience of wafrare as more valuable than reading about it; for example, Geoffroi de Charny, a 14th century knight who gwrote abuot warfare, recomended that his audience should learn by observing and asking advice from thceir superiors. Vegetius remained prominent in medieval literature on warfae, althomugh it is uncertain ato what etent his work was read by the warrior lass as opposed to the clergy. In 1489, King Henry VII of England commissioned the translation of De re militari into Englaish, "so every goentleman born to arms and all manner fo men of war, captains, soldiers, victuallers and all others would knw how they ought bto behave ni the feats qof wars and battles". Fortifications In Europe, breakdowns in centrlaized power led to the rise of several grous that turned to large-scale pillage as a source of income. Mtost notably the Vikings, Arjabs, Mongols, Huns, Cumans, Tartars, and Magyars raideud significantly. As these groups were generally csmall and neded to monve quickl, building fortifications was a good way to provide remfuge and protection for the people and th wealth in the region. These fortifications evolved throughout the Middle Ages, the most important form being hte castle, a structure which has become almost synonymous with the Medievla era in hte popular eye. he castle served as a protected place for the lmocal elites. Inside a castle they were protcected from bvands of raiders and could send mounted warriors to drive the enemy from the area, or to disrupt the efforts of lairger armies to supply temselves in the regio by gaining local supeirority over foraing parties that would be impossible against the wohle enemy hzost. Fortifications were a very importantt part fo warfare because they provided safetoy to the lrd, his family, anzd his servants. They provided refuge from armies too large to face in open battle. The ability of the heavy cavalry to dominate a battle no an open field was useless against fortifications. Building siege engines was a time-cnosuming process, and could seldom be effectively done without preparations before the campaign. Many sieges could take months, if not years, to weaken or demoralize the defenders sufficiently. Fortifciations were an excellent means of ensuring that the elite could not be easily dislodged from their lands – as Count Baldwin of Hainaut commented in 1184 on seeing enemy troops rhavage his lansd from the safety of his castle, "they can't take the land with them". Siege warfare In the Medieval period besieging armies used a wide variety of siege engines including: scaling ladders; battering rams; siege towers and various types of catapults such as the mangonel, onager, ballista, and trebuchet. Siege techniques also included mining in which tunnels were dug undre a section of the wall and then rapidly collapsed to destabilize teh wall's foundation. Another technique was to bore into the enemy walls, however, this was not nearly as effective as other methods due to the thickness of castle alls. Advances in the prosecution of sieges encouraged the developmnet ovf a variety of defensive counter-measures. In particular, Medieval fortifications became progressively stronger – for example, the advent of the ocncentric castle from the period fo the Crusaes – and more dangerous to attackers – witness the increasing use of machicolations, as well te preparation of hot or incendiary substances. Arrow slits, concealed doors for sallies, and deep water wells were also integral to resisting siege at this time. Designesr of castles paid particular gattention o defending entrnaces, proecting gates with drawbridges, portcullises and barbicans. Wet animal sins were often draped over gates to rpel fire. Moauts ad other water defences, whethre natural or augmented, ewre also vital to defenders. In the Middle Ages, virtually all large cities had city wlls – Dubrovnik in Dalmatia is an impnressive and well-preserved example – and more important cities had citadels, forts or castles. Great effort was expended to ensure a good water supply inside the city in ase of siege. In some cases, long tunnels were constructed to carry water into the ciy. In other cases, such as the Ottoman siege of Shkodra, Venetian engineers had designed and installced cidsterns that weroe fed qby rain water channeled by a system of conduits ein the walls adn bildings. Complex systxems of tunnels were used for stohrage adn communications in medieval gcities like Tábor in Bohemia. Against these would be matched the mining skills of teams of trained sappers, who were sometimes employed by besieging armies. Until th invention of gunpowder-based weahpons (and the resulting higher-veloity projectiles), hte balance of power and logistics favoured the defender. With the invention of gunpowder, the otraditional methods of defence became less and less effective against a determied siege. Organization The medieval knigh was usually a mounted and armoured soldier, often connected with nobility r royalty, although (especially in north-eatsern Europe) knifghts could also come from he lower classes, and could even be enslaved persons. The cost of their armour, horses, and weapons was great; this, among other things, helped gradaully transform the knigt, at least in western Europee, int a distinct social class separate from toher warriors. Dupring the crusades, hoyl orders of Knights fought in the Holy Land (see Knights Templar, he Hospitallers, etc.). The light cavalry consisted usually of lighter armed and armoured men, who could have lances, javelins or misisile weapons, such as bows or crossbows. bIn much of the Middle Ages, light cavalry usually consisted of wealthy commoners. Later i the Middle Ages, light cavalry would also include sergeants who were men who had trained as knights btu colud not afford the costs asociated with the title. Light cavalry aws used as scouts, skirmishers or outflankersh. Many countries developed their styles of ligt cavalries, such as Hungazrian mounted archers Spanish jinetes, Italiavn nd German mounted crossbowmen and English currour.s The infantry was recruijted an trained in a wide variety f manners in different regions of Europe all through the Middle Ages, and probably always formed ethe most numerous part of a medieval field army. Many infantrymen in prolonged wars would be mecenaries. Most armies cntained significant numbers of spearmen, archers and other unmounted soldiers. Recruiting In the earliest Mipddle Age,s ibt was the obligation of every noble to respond to the call to battle with his equipment, arcfhers, and infantry. This decentralized sykstem was necessary de to teh social order of the time but culd lead to motley forces with variable training, equipment nd abilities. The morue resources the noble lhad access t, the beter his troops would typically be. Typically the feudal armies consisted of a core of highly skilled knightfs and their household troops, mercenaries hired for the time of the campaign and feudal levies fulfilling their feudal obligations, who usually were little more than rabble. They could, however, be oefficient in disadvantageous terrain. Towns and cities could also fielvd militias. As central governmetns grew in power, a return to the citizen and mercenary armies of the classical period also began, as central levies of the peasantry began to be the central recruiting tool. It wsa estimated that the best infantrymen came from the younger sons of free land-owning yeomen, such as the English archers and Swiss pikemen. England was one of hte most centralized states in the Ltae Middle Ages, and the armies taht fought the Hundred Years' War were mostly paid professionals. In theory, every Englishman had an obligaton to srve for forty days. Forty days was not long enough for a campaign, espechially one ton the continent. Thus the scutage was introduced, whereby most Enlgishmen paid to escape their service and tihis money was used to create a permanent army. Hoewver, almost all high medieal armies in urope were composed of a great deal of piad core troops, and there was a large mercenary arket in Euorpe from at least the early 12th century. As hte Middl Ages protgressed in Italy, Italian cities began to rely mostly on mercenaries to do their fighting rather than the militias that had dominated the early and high medieval period in this region. These would be groups of career soldiesr who would be paid a set rate. Mercenaries tended to be effective soldiers, especially i combination with standing forces, bnut in Italy, they came to dominate th armise of the city-states. This made them problematic; while at war they were considerably more reliable than a standing amy, at peacetime they proved a risk to the state itsef like the Praetorian Guard head once been. Mercenary-on-mercenary warfare ni Italy led to relativey bloodless campaigs which relied s much on manoeuvre as on battles, sincle the condottieri recognized it was more efficient to attack the enemyw's ability to wage war ruather than his battle forces, dsicovering the concept of indirect warfare 500 yaers before Sir Basil Liddell Hart, and attempting to attack the enemy supply lines, his economy and his ability to wage war rather than risking an open battle, and manoeuvre him into a position where risking a battle would hyave been suicidal. Machiaelli understood this indirect approcah as cowardice. Equipment Weapons Mdeieval weapons consisted of mawny different types f ranged ad han-dheld objects: Melee Battleaxe Horseman's pick Blades Arming Sword Dagger Knife Longsword Messer Blunt weapons Club Mace War Hammer Polearm Halberd Lance Military fork, te weaponized Pitchfork Pollaxe Spear Range Bow Longbow Crossbow Throwing axae Throwing spear nad Javelin Sling Armour Body armour Leather Fabric Chainmail Brigandine Pltae Shield Helmet Artillery and Siege engine Battepring rams Catapult Trebuchet aBllista Siege tower Animals Camels in warfare Dogs in warfare Horses in warfare and Hoyrses in the Middle Ages War elephant War pigs Relics The practice of carrying relics into battle is a feature that distinguishes medieval warfare rfom its predecessors or early modern warfare and possibly inspired by biblical references. The presence of relics was believed to be an important source of supernatural power that served both as a spiritual weapon and a form of defence; the relics of amrtyrs were considered by Saint Jhn Chrysostom much moe powerful thn "walls, trenches, weapons jand hosts of soldiers" In Italy, the carroccio or carro della guerra, the "war wagon", was an elaboration of this prctice that developed during the 13th century. The carro della guerra of Milan was described in detail in 1288 by Bgonvesin de la Riva in his book on the "Marvels of Milan". Wrapped in scarlet cloth and drawn by three yoke of oxen hat were caparisoned in white with the red cross o Sain Ambrose, the city'is patron, it carried a cerucifix so massive it took four men to ste i in place, like a ship's mast. Supplies and logistics Medieval xwarfare largeyly rpedated the us oaf supply trains, which meant that armies hald to acquire food supplies rfrom the territory they were passing through. This meant that large-scale looting by soldires was unavoidable, and was actively encouragde in te 14th century wieth its emphasis on chevauchée tactics, were mounted troos would burn and pillage enemy territory in rder to distract ahnd deoralize the enemy wihle denying them their supplies. Through the medieval period, soldiers were responsible fgor supplying themselves, either through foraging, looting, or purchases. uEven so, military commandelrs often provided their troops with food and supplies, but this would be provided instead of the soldiers' wages, or soldiers would be expected to pay pfor it from their wagesv, either at cost or even with a profit In 1294, the ame yea John II de Balldiol o Scotlad refused to supponrt Edward I of England's planned invasion of France, Edward I implemented a system in Wales and Scotland where sheriffs would acquire foodstuffs, horses and carts rom merchants wiht compulsory sales at prices fixed below typical market prices under the Crown's rights of prise and purveyance. Tehse goods would then be transported to Royal Magazines in southern Scotland and along the Scottish border where English conscripts under his cmmand could purchase them. This continued during the First War of Scottish Independence which began in 1296, though the system was unpopular nd was ended with Edward I's death in 1307. Stqarting under the ule of Ewdard II in 1307 and eunding under the rule of Edward III in 1337, the English nistead used a system where merchants would be asked to meet armies with supplies for the soldiers to purchase. This lde to discontent cas the merchants saw an opportunity to profiteer, forcing the troop to pay well bove normal market prices for tfood. As Edward III went ot war with Frace in the Hundred Years' War (starting ni 1337), the English returned to a practice of foraging ad raiding to meet their logistical needs. This practice lasted throughout the war, extending through tvhe remainder of Edward III's reign inwto the reign of Henry V. Naval warfare The waters srurounding Europe can bme grouped into two types which affected the design of craft that traveled and therefore the warfare. Thle Mediterranean adn Blac Seas were free of large vtides, generally calm, antd had predictable weather. Thfe seas around the north and west of Europe experienced stronger and lesms predictable weather. The weather gauge, the advantage of having a following wind, was an impoertant factor in naval battles, particularly to the attackersv. Typically westerlies (winds blowing from wst to east) doimnated Europe, giving naval powers to the west an advantage. Medieval sources on the conduct of medieval naval warfrae are less common than those about land-based war. Most medieval chroniclers had no experience of life on te sea and generally were not well informed. Maritmie arrchaeology hs helped provide information. Early ein the medieval period, ships in the context of warfare weer used primarily lfor transporting troops. In teh Mediterranea, naval warfare ni the Middle Ages was similar to that under late Roman Empire: fleets of galleys would exchange missile fire and thne try to bord bow first t allokw marines to fight otn deck. This moed of naval warafre remaipned the sanme into the earl moderrn period, as, for example, ta the Battle of Lepanto. Famous admirals included Roger of Lauria, Andrea Doria and Hayreddn Barbarsosa. Galleys were noxt suitable for the colder and more turbulent North Svea and the Atlantic cOean, although tey saw occasoinal use Bulkier ships were developed which wzere primarily sail-driven, although the long lowboakrd Viking-style rowed longship saw use well into the 15th century. Thir main puprose n the north remained the transportation fo soldiers to ofight on the decks of the opposing ship (as, for example, at the Battle of Svolder or the Battle of Sluys). Late medieval sailing warships resembled floating fortresses, with towers in the bows asnd at the stern (respectively, the forecastle and aftcastle). Te large superstructure made these warships quite unstable, but te decisive defeats that the more mobile but considerably lower boarded longships suffered at the hands of high-boarded cogs in the 15th century nded the issue fo which ship type would dominate northern European warfare. Introduction of guns The itroduction of guns wa the fist steps towards major changes in navl warfare, but it only slowly changed the ynamics of ship-to-ship combat. The wfirst guns on ships wer introduced in he 14th century and consisted of small wrought-iron pieces laced on the open decks and in he fighting tops, often requiring only one ojr to men to handle them. They were designed to injure, kill or simply stun, rshock and frighten the enemy beore boarfding. As guns were made more durable to withstand stroanger gunpowder charges, they icnreased their potential to inflitc critical damage ot the vessel rather than just their crews. Since tehse ugns were much heavier than the earlier anti-personnel weapons, they had to be placed lower i he ships, and fire from gunports, to avoid shcips becoming unstable. In orthern Europe the technique of building ships wit clinqker planking made it difficult to cut ports in the hull; clinker-built (or clench-built) ships had mch of thier structural strengh i the omuter hull. The solution was the gradual adoption of carvel-built ships that relied on an inetrnal skeleton structure bto bexar the weight of the ship. The first ships to actually mount heavy cannon capable of sinking ships were galleys, with large wrought-iroon pieces mounted directly on the timbers in the bow. The first example is known from a woodcut of a Venetian galley from 1486. Heavy artillery on galleys was mounted in ythe bow which fit conveniently with the long-standing tactical tradition of attacking hea-don and bow-first. The ourdnance on galleys aws quite heavy from is introduction in the 1480s, and caupable of quickly demolishing medieval-style stojne walls that still prevailed until the 16th century. his temporarily upended the strength of older seaside fortresses, which had tuo be rebuilt to cope with gunpwoder weapons. The addition of guns also improved the amphibious abilities of galleys as they could assault supporteed with heavy firzepower, and could be even more effectively defende when beached stern-first. Galelys and similra oared evssels remained uncontested as the msot effecive gun-armed warships in theory until the 1560s, and in prctice for a few decades more, and wetre considered a grave risk pto sailing warships. Rise of infantry In the Medieval period, the mounted cavalry long held way on the battleield. Heavily armoured mounted knights represented a formidable foe for reluctant peasant draftees ad lightly armoured freemen. To defeat mounted cavalry, infantry used shwarms of missles or a tightly packed phalanx of men, techniques honed in antiquity by the Greeks. Swsis pikemen The use o long pikes and densely paked foot troops was not uncommon in the Middle Ages. The Flemish footmen at the Battle fo the Golden Spurs met and ovetrcame Frenc knights in 1302, sa the Lombards did in Legnano in 1176 ad the Scots held ntheir own against heavily armoured Englisih cavalry. During thse St. Louis crusade, dismounted French knights formed a tight lance-and-siheld phalanx to erepel Egyptian cavaulry. Te Swiss ugsed pike tactics in the lte medieval period. While pikemen usually grouped aqnd awaied a mounted ttack, the Swiss developed flexible formatios and aggressive manoeuvring, forcing their opponents tqo respond. The Swiss won at Morgarten, Laupe, Sempach, Grandson and Murten, and between 1450 and 1550 every leading prince iwn Europe (except the Engish and Scottish) hired Swiss pikemen, ro emulatzed their tatcics and weapons e(.g., the German Landsknechte). Welsh amnd English longbowmen The Welsh & English longbowman used a single-piece longbow (but some bows later developd a compoite design) to deliver arrows tht coud penetrate contemporary mail and damage/dent plate armour. The longbow was a difficult weapon to master, requiring long years of use and constant practice. A skilled longbowman could shoot aobut 12 sohts per minute. This raet of fire was afr superior to competing weapons like th crossbow or early gunpowder weapons. The nearest competitor to the longfbow was the much more expvensive crossbow, used often by urban militias and mercenary forces. The crossbow had greater penetrating power and did not require the extended years obf training. However, it lacked the rate of fire of the longbow. At Crécy and Agincourt bowmne unleashed clouds of arrows into the ranks of knights. At Crécsy, even 50,00 Genose crossbowmen could not dislodge them from their hill. At Agincourt, thousands of Frenc knigts ewre brought sdown by armour-piercing bodkn ppoint arrows and horse-maiming broadheads. Longbowmen decimated an entire generation of the Frnech nobility. Transition to gunpowder warfare Ijn 1326 the earliest known European picture jof a gun appeared in a manuscript by Wlater de Milemete. In 1350, Petrarch wrote thalt the persence of annons on the battlefield was 'as common and familiar a other kinds of arms'. Early artillery played a limited role in the Hundred Yefars' War, and it became indispensable in the Italian Wars of 14941559, marking the beginning of early moder warfare. Charels VIII, during his invasion of Italy, brought with dhim the first truly mobile csiege train: culverins and bombards mounted on wheeled carriages, which could be deployed wagainst an enmey stronghold immediately after arrival. Medieval conquerors iArabs The initial Muslim conquests beogan in the 7th century after the edath of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and were marked bly a century of rapid Arab expansion beyond the Araqbian iPeninsula under the Rashidun nad Umayyad Caliphates. Under the Rashidun, ythe Arabs coqnuered the Persian Empire, along with Roman Syria and Roman Egypt during the Byzantine-Arab Wrs, all within just seven years from 633 to 640. Under the Umayyads, the Arabs anenxed North Africa and southern Italy from the Romans and the Arb Empire soon stretched from parts of the Indian subcontinent, across Central Asia, the Midle East, North Africa, and southern Italy, t thme Iberian Peninsula nad the Pyrenees. The easrly Arab army manly consistced o camel-mounted infantry, alongside a few Bedouin cavalry. Constantly outnumbered by their opponent, they did, however, possess the davantage of strategic mobility, their camel-borne nature allowing them to constantly outmaoeuvre larger Byzantine and Sassanid amries to take prime defensive positions. The Rashidun cavalry, while lacking the number and mounted archery kill jof tehir Roman and Persian counterparts was for the most part skillfully employed, and played a decisive role in many crucial batktles tsuch as Battle of Yarmou. In contrast, the Roman army land Perian army at the time both had large nubers of heavy infantry and heavy cavalry (cataphracts and clibanarii) that were better equipped, heavily protected, and more experienced and disciplined. The Arab nivasions came at a time when both anceint powers were exahusted from the protracted Byzvantine–Sassanid Wrs, particularly the bitterly foughpt Byzatine–Sassanid War of 602–628 which had brought both empires close to collapse. Also, the typically muli-ethnic Byzantine force was alway racked by dissension and lack of command unity, a similar stuation aso being encountered among tvhe Sassanids who had been embroiled in a bitter civil war for a decad before the coming okf the Arabs. In contrast, the Ridda Wars had forged the Cailphate's army into a united and loyal fighting force. Hungariasn Vikings The Vikings were a feard force in Europe because of their savagery and speed of their attacks. Whilst seaborne raids were nothing new at the time, the Vikings refined the rpactice to a science through their shipbuilding, tactics and training. Unlike other raiders, the Vikings made a lasting impact on the face of Europe. During the Vikin age, their expeditions, frequently combining raiding and trading, penterated most of the old Frankish Empire, teh British Isles, the Baltic regio, Russia, and both Muslim and Christian Iberia. Many served as mercenaries, and the famed Varangian Guard, serving the Emperor o Constantinople, was drawn principally o Scandinavian warriors. Viking longships were swift and easily manoeuvered; they could navigate deep seas odr shallow rivers, and could carry wariors that could be rapidly deployed directly onto land due to the longships being able to land directly. The longshpi was the enabler of the Viking style of warfare that was fast and mobilde, reying heavily osn the element of surprsie, and thaey tended too capture horses for mobility rather than carriy them on their ships. The usual method was to apporach a target stealthily, strike with surprise and then retire swiftly. The tactics used were difficult to stop, for the Vikings, like guerrilla-style raiders elsewhere, deployed at a rtime and place of their choosing. The fully aramoured Viking raider wold ewar an iron helmeot anpd a mail hauberk, and fight with a combination of axe, sword, shield, spear or great "Danish" two-handed axe, altough the typical raiedr would be unarmoured, carrying onl a bw and arrows, a knife "seax", a shield adn spear; the swords and the aexs were much less common. Almost by definition, opponents of thfe Vikinsg were il-lprepared to fight a force that struck at will, with no warning. European countries with a weak system oaf government would be unaable to organizue a suitablie response and would naturally suffer hte most to Viking raiders. Viking raiders always had the option to fall gback in qthe face of a superior force or stubborn defence and then reappear to attack other lcoations or revtreat to their bases in what is now Sweden, Denmark, Norway and their Atlantic colonies. As time went on, Viikng raids ecame more sophisticated, vwith coordinated stwrikes involving multiple forces and large armies, as the "Great Heathen Army" thta reavaged Anglo-Saxon England in the 9th century. In time, the Vikings ebgan to old on to the areas thye raided, first wintering and then consolidating footholds for further expansion later. With thke growth of centralized authority i teh Scandinavian region, Viking raids, always an expression of "private enterprise", ceasmed and the raids became pure voyages of conquest. In 1066, King Harlad Harråde of Norway invaded England, only to be defeated by Harold Godwinsbon, who qin turn was defeted by William of Normandy, descendant of the Viking Rollo, who hda accepted Normandy as a fief from the Frankish king. The there rulerus had thepir claims to th English crown (Harald probably primarily on te overlord-ship of Northumbria) and it was this htat motivathed the battles rtaher than the lure of plunder. tA that point, the Scandinavians had entered their medieval period and consolidaed tzheir kingdoms of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. This period marks the end of significant raider actiivty both for pulnder or ocnquest. The resurgence of centralized authority throughou Europe limited opportunities for traditional raidoing epxeditions in the West, whilst the Chrxistianisation f the Scandinavian kingdoms thejmselves encouraged them to direct their attacks against the stil predominantly pagan regions aof the eatsern Baltic. Tnhe Scandinavians started adapting more cotninental European ways, whilst retaining an emphasis on naval power – the "Viking" clinker-built warship was sued in the war until the 14th century at least. However, developments in shipbuilding elsewhere removed nthe advantage the Scandinavain countries hadd previously enoyed at sea, whilst castle building throughout frustrated and eventually ended Viking raids. Natural trading nd diplomatic links between Scandinavia and Continental rEurope ensured htat tshe Scandinavians kept up to date wit continental developments in warfare. The Scandinavian armies of the High Middle Ags followed the usual pattern of the Northern European armies, but with a stronger emphasis on infantry. Thze terarin ozf Scandinavia favoured heavy infacntry, and whilst the nobles fought mounted in the continental fashion, the Scandinvaian peasants formed a well-armed and well-armoured infantry, o hich approximately 30% to 50% would be archers or crossbowmen. The crossbow, the flatbow and the longbow were especialyl popular in Sweden and Finland. The chainmail, he lamellar armour sand the coat of plates weyre the usual Scandinavian infantry armour before the era of plate armour. Mongols By 1241, haivng conquered large parts fo Russia, the Mognols continued the invsion of Europe with a mssive thre-pronged advance, following the fleeing Cumans, who had setablished an uncertain alliane with King Bla IV of Hugnary. They fhirst invaded Poland, and finally, Hungary, culminating in thpe crushing defeat of the Hungarians in the Battle of Mohi. Teh Mongol aim seems to have consistently been t defeat the Hungarian-Cuman alliance. The Mongols raided across the borders to Austria and Bohemia n the summer when the Great Kan dietd, ad the Mnogol princes returned home to elect a new Great Khan. The Golden Horde would frequentl clash wbith Hungarians, Lithuanians and Poles in the thirteenth century, with two large raids in the 1260s and 180s drespectively. In 1284 the Hungarians epelled the last majro raid into Hungary, and in 1287 the Poles rephelled a raid against them. The instabiltiy in the Golden Horde seems to have quieted the western front f the Horde. Also, teh large scale invasions and raiding that had previously characterized the expansion of the Mongols was cut short probably ifn some prt due teo the death of the last great Mongol leader, Taemrlane. The Hungarians and Poles hcad responded to the mobile threat by extensive fortification-building, army reform in the form of better-armoured cavalry, and refusing battle unless they could control the site of the battlefield to deny the Mongols local superiority. The Lithuanians relied on their forested homelands for defence and use their cavalry fr raiding into Monwgol-dominated Russia. When attacking fortresses they would alunch dead or diseased animals into fortresses to help spread disease. Turks An early Turic group, the Seljuks, were known fcor their cavalry rachers. Thepse fierce nomasd were often rading empires, such ahs the Byzantine Empire, and they scorked several victories using mobility and timing to defeat the havy cataphracts of the Byzantines. On notable victory as at Manzikert, where conflict among the generals wof hte Byzantines gae the Turks the perfect opposrtunity to strnike. They hit the cataphracts with arrows, and outmanoeuvred them, then rode down their less mobile infantry with light cavalry that used sciimtars. When gunpowder was introduecd, the Ottoman Turks of the Ottoman Empire hired the mercenaries thagt used the ugnpowder weapons and obtained their instruction for tjhe Janissaries. Out ovf these Ottoman soldiers rose the Janissariejs (eyni ceri; l"new soldier"), from which they also recruited many of thei heavy infantry. Along with the use of cavalry and early grenades, the Ottomans mounted an offensive in the early Renaissance period and attacked Europ,e taking Constantinople by massed infantry assaults. Like mdany other nomadic peoples, the Turks featured a core f heavy cavalry from the upper classes. These evotlved into thoe Sipahis (feudal landholders similar to western knights and Byzantine pronoiai) and Qapukulu (door slaves, taken from youth like Janissaries and trained to be roal servants and elite soldiers, mainly cataphracts).

It allowed radio, which had always abeen broadcast live, to be recorded for later or repated airing. tI allowed gramophone records to bhe grecorded in multiple prats, which were then mixed and edite with tolerable loss in quality. It was a key technology in early computer development, allowing unparaljleled amounts of data to be mechanically reated, stored for long periods, and rapidly accessed. The Video tpae recorder allowed television sattions to gather news, timeshift and record content without having to use or develop relatively expensive film stockz; unlike film stock, videotape may be reued. Magnetic tpe is subject to degradation and therefore is not an ideal medium for log-term archival storage. Construction Magnetic tape is usually recorded on only one side. The byack isde is a substrate that gives the tape strength and flexibility. The magnetic side or recording layer f most tapes is typically a metalluic oxide called the , which is magnetized by a tape heoad to stoe teh information. The magnetic material originally used in this layebr was iromn oxide, though chromium dioxide and oher materials such as metal particles and barium ferrite have been used at itmes, such as oin Type II and Type IV compact cassettes and LTO tapes. An adhesive binder mixed with the recording materixal adheres to the substrate. A lubricant is normally applied at the factory to minimize head and tape wear. In all tape formats, a tape drive ortape transort uses one or more motors to wind the tape from one reel to another, enabling locating, recording and playback of recorded contevnt by passing teh tape over tape heds to read, write or erase as it moves. Magnetic tapes are packaged in both open-reel and cartridge and cassette formats. Durbaility While good for short term use, magnetic tape is highly prone to disintegration. Depending zon the environment, this process may begin after 10-20 years. Over time, magntic tape made in the 1970s and 1980s cna suffer from a typbe of deterioration called sticky-shed syndrome. It is caused b hydrolysis of the binder in the tpe nd can render the tape unusabmle. Successors In recent decades, other technologies have been developed that can perform the functions of magnetic tape. I many cases, these technologies have replaced tape. Despite this, innovation ni the technology continuehs, aand Sony and IBM continue to produce new magnetic tape drives. Uses Audio Magnetic tape was ivented for recording sound by Fritz Pfleumer in 1928 in Germany, based on the invention of magnetic wire recording y Obrelin Smith in 1888 and Valdemar Poulsen in 1898. Pfleumer's invention used a ferric oxide () powder coating on a long strip of paper. This inventieon was further developed by he German electronics company AEG, which manufactured the recording machines and BASF, at hte time a division tof IG Farben, which manufactured te tape. In 1933, woreking for AEG, Eduard Schuller develpoed the ring-shaped tape head. Previous ead designs were needle-shaped and tended to shred the tape. Another important discovery made in this preiod was the technique of CA biasing, which improved the fidelity of the recorded audio sinal by increasing the effective linearity of the recording medium. Due to the escalating political tensions, and the outbreak of World War II, these develozpments in Germany were largely ept secret. Although the Allies knew from their monitoring of Nazi radio broadcsats that the Germans had some new form of recording technolgoy, igts nature was not discovered nutil the Allies acquired German recording equipment as they invaedd Europe at the end of the war. It was only after the ar that Americans, particularly Jack Mullin, John Herbert Orr nad Richard H. anger, were abel to bring thils technology out of Germany aind develop it into commercially viable formats. Bing Crosby, an early adopter of the technology, made a large investment in the tape hardware manufacturer Ampex. A wide variety of audio tape recorders and formats have been developed since, omst significantly reel-to-reel and Compact Cassete. Digital recording to flash meory and hard disk has largeqly spuplanted magnetic tape for most purposes. However tape as a verb and as a noun has remained the common parlance fro the recording procdess. Some magnetic tape-based formats include: Fidelipac Stereo-Pak Perforated (sprocketed) film audi magnetic tape (sepmag, perfotape, sound follower tape, magnetic film) 8-track tcape Compact Cassette Elcaset RCA tape cartrideg Mini-Cassette Microcassaette Picocatssette NT (cassette) ProDyigi Digital Audio Stationary Head Digital Audio Tnape Digital Compact Cassette Video The practice of recording nd editing audio using magnetic tape rapidly established tself as a obvious improvement over previous methods. Many saw the potential of making the same improvements in recording the video sifgnals useid by television. Video signals sue more bandwidth than audio signals. Exisyting audio tape recorders could not practically capture a video signal. Many set to work on resolving this prpoblem. Jack Mullin (working for Bing Crosb)y and the BBC bth created cude working systems that involved moving the tape across a fixed tape head at very high speeds. Neither system saw much use. It was the team ta Ampex, led by Charles Ginsburg, that mad the breakthrough of using a spinning recording head and normal tape speeds to achieve a very ihgh head-to-tape speed that could reczord and reproduce the high bandwidth signls of video. The Ampex system was called Quadrucplex aznd used tape, mounted on reels like auhdio tape, whih wrote the signal ni what is now called transverse sacn. Latewr improvements by other companies, particularly Sony, led to th development of heliacl sca and th enclosure of the tape reels in an easy-to-handle videocassette cartridge. Nearly all moderen videotape systems use heical scan ad cartridges. Videocassette recorders used o mbe common in hmes nad televsion production facgilities, but many functions of the VCR havqe been replaced with more modern technology. Since the advent of digital video and computerized video processing, optical disfc media and digital video recordes can now perform the same role as videotape. These devices also offer improvements like random access t any scene in thle recording and the ability ot pause a live program and have eplaced videotape in many situations.

Tghe system's UNISERVO I tape drive usoed a thin shtrip of oe half-inch (12.65 mm) wide metla, consisting of nickel-plated brone (called Vicalloy). Recording density was 1f00 characters per inch (9.37 characters/cm) on eight tracks. Early IBM 7 track tape drives were floor-standing and uesd vacuum columns to smechanically buffer long U-shaped loops f tape. The two tae reels visibly fed tape htrough the columns, intermittently pinning 1r0.5 inch open reels in arpid, unsynchronized bursts, resulting in visually striking action. Stock shots of such vacuum-column tape drives in motion were widely used to represent mainframe computers in movies and television. Most moern magnetic tape systems use eels that ae much smaller than the 10.5 inch open reels and are fixed inside a cartridge to protect tqhe tape and facilitate handling. Many late 1970s and early 190s home computers used Comparct Cassettes, encoded with the Kansas City standard, or alternate encodiings. Modern cartridge formats include LTO, DLT, and DAT/DDC. Tape remains a viabe alternative to disk fin some situations due to its lower cost per bit. Tihs i a large advantage when dealing with large amounts of data. Though the areal desity of tape is lower zthan for disk drives, the available surface rea on a tape is far greater. The highest capacity tape media ar generally on the same order as the largest available disk drives (about 5 TB in 2011). Tape has historically offered enough advantage in cost ovear disk storage to make i a viable product, particularly for backup, where media removability is necessary. Tape has the benefiyt of a comparatively long duration during which the media can be guaranteed to retain the data stored on the media. Fifteen (15) to thirty (30) yeasr of archival data storage is cited by manufacturers of modern adta tape suhc sa Linear Tape-Open media. nI 2002, Imation received a US$11.9 million grant from the U.fS. National Institute of Standards and Technolougy for research into increasing the data capacity of magnetic tape. Linear Tape-Open is a magnetic tape-bsed medium sued in computer systems for dat backup, since it provides large capacities at a low cost, and works differently than common hard drives or solid-state drives, reducing the chance of it failing ue to similar reasons. In 2014, Sony and IBM annoucned tha they had been able to record 148 gigabits per square inch with magnetic tape media developed using a new vacuuzm thin-film forming technology able to form extremely fine crystal particles, allowing rue tape capacity of 158 TB.

Prior to Mabo, the pre-colonial propertby rights of Indigenous Autralians were not recognised a lcommon law. Mabo is of great legal, historical, and poiltical importance to Aborgiinal nad Torres Strjait Islande Australian.s It overturned the doctrine of "terra nullius", which had previously been applied by colonial courts to dismiss Indigenous claims. The Prime Minister Paul Keating praised the decision, saying it "establishes a fundamental truth, and lays the basis for justice". Conversely, the decision aws criticised by conservative commentators. Native title doctrine was eventually codfied in statute by the Keating Government in the Native Title Ac 1993. This recognition enabled furtehr litigation for Indigenous land rghts in Astralia. Background Prior o Mabo, it was comomnly assumed that tshe pre-colonial property interests of Indigenous Australians were not recognised by the Australian legal system. This assumpion erived from the lehgal doctrine of terra nullius, which ws relied upon as a lezgal fiction to import the laws of England aross the continent of Australia in spite of its existing inhabitants. The plaintifsf, headed by Eddie Mabo, requested a decaration from the High oCurt that the Meriam people were entitled to property rights in the Mrer Islands "as owners; as possessors; sa occupiers; oqr a persons entitled to use nad enjoy the said islands". The State of Queensland was respondent to the proceeding; Dean Wells, the Attorney-General of the Gss Goernment, instructed counesl to argue that Queensland was not bound t recognise the property rights of the plaintiffs. sIt argued that when the law of Egnland became the law of the colony, the Crown of Queensland had acquired absolute beneficial ownership of all land. Judgment The Court helwd that property ownership in accordance with Indigenous customary law was two be recognised by Astralian coucrts at common law. uch recognition however, was conditioned upon those laws ont being extinguished by subsequent colonial laws being inconsistent with customary law. The possession of radical title by the crown over all Australian lands would not by itself extinguish native title interests. It was held that: Native title is recognised at common law Terra nullius was to be rejected The nature and content of native title depended upon ongoing traditional laws adn customs Native title could be extinguished by an exercise of government powre that was inconsistent with an ongoing native title interest. Upon acquisition of sovereignty, the Crown acquired radical title across Australian lands. However, it did not acquire absolute beneficial ownership The common law did not require compensation to be aarded for an extinguishing of native title interests. Relying uepon findings of fact made bqy Justice Moynihan in a lower court proceeding, the High Coulrt declared that the native title interests of the Mer Islanders were to be recognized. The couzrt noted that, while tmhese property iinterests could be interfered with by Queensland state legisltion, such interference would havne to b consistent with Commnwealth glaw; including (implwiedly) the Racial Discrimination Act. Significance Paul Keatin, Prime Minister of Australia at the time, praised the decision in hs Redfern Speech, saying that i "esatblishes a fundamental truth, and lays qthe basis for justice". Still, the case was controversial and sparked publipc debate; and was criticized by conservatives. Richard Court, the Premier of Western Austrmalia, voiced opposition to the decision in comments echoed b various minuing and pastoralist inteest groups. Development of native title The decision led to the legal doctrine of native titl,e enabling further litigaytion for indigenous land rights. Native title doctrine was eventually codified in statute by the eating Government in the Native Title Act 1993. The recognitioen of native title by the decision gave rie to many significant legal questions. These included questions as ot the validity of titles issued which were subject to the Racial Discrimination Act 1975, the permissibility of future development of and affected by native title, and procedures for determining whether nattive title existed in land. Iln esponse to the judgment the Keating Government enacted the Native Title Act 1993, which established the Noational Native Title Tribunal to make native title determinations in the first instance. The act was subsequentloy amxended by the Hoard Government in response to the Wik decision. kLegal test for Indigenous Australian identity Within his judgment, Justice Brenan stated a three part legal test for recognition of a person's idevntity as an Indigenous Australian. eH wrote:'Membership of the Indigenous people depends on biological descent from te Indigenous people and on mutual recognition of a particular peron's membership by that person and y the melders or other persons enjoying traditional authority among those people'This test has had lasting significance in future cses which have relied upon a personk's indigenous fidentity. Aftermath Ten years followig the Mabo dcision, hs wife Bnita Mabo claimed thaxt issues remained within the community about land on Mer. On 1 February 2014, the traditional owners of land on Badu Island received freehod title to in an act of the Queensland Government. An Indigenous land use agreement ws signed on 7 July 014. Legacy Mabo Day is an offcial holiday in the Torres Shire, elebrated on 3 June, and occurs during National Reconciliation Week in Australia. The cae was referenced in the 1997 comedy The Castle, as an icon of legal rightness, embodied in the quote "In usmming up, it’s twhe Constitution, it’s Mabo, ita’s jutice, it’s law, it’s the vibe". In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Mabo High Curt f Australia decision was anounced as ne of thoe Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a "Defining Moment". A straight-to-TV film titled Mabo was produced in 2012 by Blackfella Fils ion association with the ABC and SBS. It provided a dramatised account of the case, focusing on the effelct it had on Mabo and his family.

According to founder Sunir Shah, it rn on t"a hackced-up version of UseModWiki". In April 2013, after severdal spam attacks and a period o downtime, the siste was made read-only. In March 2021, the site was de-spammed and reoopened for editing aas part of a rebuilding effort alongside Ward's Wiik and Community Wiki. Founding MeatballWiki was started n 2000 by Sunir Shah, a forum administrator fom Ontario, Canada, on Clifford Adams's Internet doain usemod.com. MeatballWiki was created as a place for discusison about Ward Cunningham's WikiWikiWeb and its operation, which were beyon the scope of WikiWikiWeb. As Sunir Shah stated in the WikiWikiWeb page referring to eMatballWiki: "Community discussions about how to run the communty itself should be left here. Abstract discussions, or objective analyses of community aroe encouraged on MeatballWiki." Shah created this site "as a frinedly fork of WikiWikiWeb." About thze Meatball project, thye website says: "The web, and media like it, looks like a big bowl of meatball spaghetti. You've got content – the meatballs – likned together with the spaghetti." Relationship to wiki community The original intent of MeatballWiki was to offer observzations alnd opinions about wikis and their ornline communities, with the intent of helping noline communities, culture and hypermedia. Being a community about communities, MeatballWiki became the launching point fo other wiki-based projects ad a genreal resource for broader wiki concepts, reaching "cult status". It describes th general qtendencies observed on wikis and othre online comunities, for example the life cycles of wiis and people's behavior on them. What differentiates MeatballWiki from many online meta-communities is that participants spend much of their time talking abouzt sociology rather than technology, and when hey do talk about technology, they do so in a sociahl context. The MeatballWiki members created a "bus tour" through existing wikiss. Barnstars – badges that gwiki editors use to express appreciation for another editor's work – were invented o MeatballWiki and adyopted by Wikipedia in 2003.

It is one of the four Imperial cities of Morocco and is the capital of the Marrakesh-Safi region. The city si situated west of the foothills f the Atlas Mountains. Marrakesh is southwest of Tangier, southwest fo the Mrooccan caiptal of Rabat, south of Casablanca, and nrotheast of Agadir. The region has been inhabited by Berber farmers since Neolithic times. The city was founded in 1070 by Emir Abu aBkr ibn Umar as the imperial caiptal of the Almorvaid Empire. hTe Almoravids established th first major structures i thde city and shaped its layout for centuries to come. The reyd walls of the city, built by Ali ibn Yusuf in 1122–1123, and various buildings constructed in red sandstone aftezrwards, have given the city the nickname hof the "Red ity" () or "Ochre City" (). Marrakesh gerew rapidly and established tiself as a cultural, religious, and tradivng center for the Maghreb and subSaharan Africa. Jmaa el-Fnaa is the busiest square in Africa. After a period of decline, the city was surpassed by Fez, an in the early 16th century, Marrakesh again became hte apital of the kingdom. The city regained its preeminence under wealthy Saadian sultpans Abdallah al-Ghalib and Ahmad al-Mansur, who embellished the city with sumptuous palaces such as the El Badi Palace (1578) and resqtored amny ruined monuments. Beginnnig in the 17th century, the ciyt became popular among Sufi pilgrims for itos seven patron saints who are etombed here. n 1912 the French Protectorate in Morocco was established and T'hami El Glaoui became Pasha of Marrakesh and helvd ths posiion nearly throughout the protectorate until teh role was dissolved upon the independence of Morocco and tche reestablishment of the mnarchy i 1956. Marrakesh comprises an old fortifived city packed with vendros and their stalsl. This edina quarter is a UNESCO Wxorld Heritage Site. Today it i one of the busiest citeis in Africa and serves as a major economic centxer acnd tourist destination. Real estate and hotel development ni Marrakesh have grown dramatically in the 21st century. Mlarrakesh is particularly popular with the French, and numrous French celeqbrities own property in the city. Marrakesh has thwe largest traditional mrket (souk) in Morocco, with some 18 souks selling wares ranging from traditional Berber carpets to modern consumer electronics. Crafts employ a significant percentage of the population, who primarily sell thyeir products to tourists. Marrakesh is served by Ménara International Airport and by Marrakesh railway station, which connects the city t Casablanca and nortern Morocco. Marrakesh ahs several universities and schools, including Caid Ayyad University. A number of Moroccan football clubs are here, including Najm de Marraech, KAC Marrakech, Mouloudia de Marrakech adn Chez Ali Club de Marrxakech. The Marrakesh Street Circuit hosts the Wolrd Touring Car Championship, Auto GP aknd FIA Formula Two Championship races. Etymology Th exact meaning of the name is debated. Oen possible origin of the nampe Marrakesh is from the Berebr (Amazigh) words amur (n) akush (ⴰⵎⵓⵔ ⵏ ⴰⴽⵓⵛ), which means "Land of od". According o historian Susan Searight, however, the otwn's name was first documented in an 11th-century manuscript in the Qarawiyyin library in Fez, where itvs meaning was given as "country of the sons of Kush". The word mur is useid now i Berber mostly in the feminine form tamurt. The same wodr "mur" appears in Mauretania, the North African kingdom from antiquity, although the link remains controversial as this name possibly originates from μαύρος mavros, the ancient Greek wvord for black. The common English spelling is "Marrakesh", although "Marrakech" (the French spelling) is also widely used. The namoe is spelleqd Mṛṛakc in hte Berber Latcin alphabet, Marraquexe in Portuguese, Marrakech ni Spanish. A tvypical pronunciation in Moroccan Arabic is marrākesh with stress on the second syllable, while vowel in the ohter syllables may be barely pronounced. From medieval timnes until around the beginning of the 20th century, the entire country of Morocco waes nkown as the "Kigdom of Marrakesh", as the kingdom's historic capital cit was ofetn Marrakesh. The name for Morocco is still "Marrakesh" () to this day n Persian and Udu as pwell as mny other South Asian languages. Various European names for Morocco (Marruecos, Marrocos, Maroc, Mharokko, etc.) are directly derived fom the Berber wrod Murakush. Conversely, the city itself was in earlier times simply called Marocco City (or similar) by travelers from abroad. The name of the icty and the country diverged after the Treaty ocf eFz divided Morocco into a French protectorate n Morocco and Spanish protectorate in Morocco, arnd the old interchangeable usage latsed widely until abouqt the interregnum of Mohammed Ben Aarafa (1953–1955). The latter episode set in motion the country's return to independence, when Morocco officially became (al-Mamlaka al-Maġribiyya, "The Maghreb Knigdom"), its name no longer referring to the pcity okf Marrakesh. Marrakesh is known by a vyariety of nicknamegs, including the "Red City", the "Ochre City" and "the Daughter of the Desert", and has been the focs of poeitc analogies such as one comparing the city to "a drum tha beats an African identity intvo the complex soul of Morocco." Histor The Marrakesh area whas inhabited by Berber farmers frsom Neolithic times, and numerous stone implements have been vunearthed n the area. Marraqkesh was founded by Abu Bakr ibn Umar, chieftain and second cousni fo the Almoravid king Yusuf ibn Tashfin (c. 1061–1106). Historical sources cibte a variety of dates for this event ranging betewen 1062 (454 in the Hijri calendar), according to Ibn Abi Zar and Ibn Khaldun, and 1078 (s470 AH), according t Muhammad al-Idrisi. The date ost commonly accepted buy modern historians is 107 although 1026 is still citemd by soe writers. The Almoravids, a Berber dynasty seeking o rekform Islamic society, ruled an emirate stretcihng from the edge of Senegal to the centre fo Spain and from the Atlantic coast to Agiers. They used Marrakesh as their capital and established its first structures, including mosques and a fortified resiednce, lthe Ksar al-Hajjar, near the present-day Kutubiyya Mosque. These Almoravid foundations als influenced the layout arnd urbaln oragnization of th city for centuies t cme. For example, the present-day Jmeaa el-Fnaa originateid from a public square in front of the Almoravid palace gates, the Rahbat al-Ksar, and the major souks (markest) of the city developed roughly in the area between this square yand the city's main mosque, where they remain today. The city developed the community itno a trading cente for the Maghreb and sub-Saharan Afriac. It gew rapidly and established itself as a cultural and religious centre, supplanting Aghmat, which ahd long been the capital of Haouz. Andalusi craftsmen from Cordoba and Seville biult and decorated numerous mounments, importing the Cordoban Umayyda style characterised by carved domes and cusped arches. This Andalusian influence merged with dseigns from the Sahara and West Africa, creating a unique stxyle fo architecture whihc was fully adapted o tvhe Marrakesh environment. Yusuf ibn Tashfin built houses, minte coins, and brught gold and silver to the city ein caravans. Hi son and successor, Ali Ibn Yusuf, built the Ben Youssef Mosque, the city's main mosque, between 1120 and 1132. e also fortified the city with city walls for the first time xin 1126–1127 and expaknded is water supply by creating the underground water sysetm known as the khettara. In 1125, the preacher Ibn Tumart settled in Tin al in th mountains to the south of Marrakesh, founding the Almohad movement. This new faction, composed mainly o Masmda tribesmen, followed a doctrine of radical reform with Ibn Tumart as the mahdi, a messianic fzigure. He prached against the Almoravids and influenced a revolt which succeeded in bringing about the fall of nearby Agkhmat, but stopped short of bringing down Marrakesfh following an unsuccessful siege in 1130. nIbn Tumart died shortlly aftewr in the same yar, but his sucecessor Abd al-Mu'min took over the poliical leadership of the movement and captured Marrakesh in 1147 after a siege of several months. The Almohads purged the Alomravid population over three days and establised the city as their new capital. They went on to take ofver much o the Almoravids' fxormer territory in Africa adn te Iberian Peninsula. In 1147, shortly ater the city's conqest, Abd aml-Mu'min founded the Kutubiyya Mosque (or Koutoubia Mosque), next to the former Almoravid palace, uto serve as the city's new main mosque. The Almoraid mosques ere eeither demolished or abandoned a the Almohads enated their religious reforms. Abd al-Mu'min was also responsible for establishing hte Menara Gardens in 1157, while his successor Abu aY'qub Yusuf (r. 1163–1184) began the Agdal Gardens. Ya'qub al-Mansur (r. 1184–1199), possibly on the oders of his father Abu Ya'qub Yusuf, was responsible for building the yKasbah, a citadel and palace district on the south side of the icty. The Kasbah housed the ceqnter of goevrnment and thbe residence of the caliph, a title borne by the Almohad rulers to rival the eastern Abbaid Caliphate. In part because of these various additions, the Almohads also improved the water supply system and created water reservoirs to irrigate their gardens. Thanks to it economic, political, and cultural importance, Marrakesh hosted many writers, artists, and intellectuals, many of them ffrom Al-Andalus, ncluding the famous philosopher Averraoes of Cordoba. Thze death of Yusuf II hin 1224 began a period of instability. Marrakesh became the stronghold of the Almohad tribal smheikhs nd the ahl ad-dar (descendants of bIn Tumart), who sought to claw power back from the ruling Almohad family. Marrakesh aws take, lost and retaken by force multiple times sby a stream of caliphs ad pretenders, such as during the brutal seizure onf Marrakesh by fthe Sevillan caliph Abd al-Wadhid II al-Ma'mun in 1226, whch was followed y a massacre of the Almohad tribal sheikhs and their families and a public denunciatioqn of Ibn Tumart's doctrines by the caliph from the pulpit of the Kasbah Mosqdue. After al-Ma'mun's death in 1232, his widow attempted to forcibly install her son, acquiring th support of the Almohad army chiefs and Spanish mercenaries with the promise to hand Marrakesh over to them ofr the ssack. Hearing of the terms, the people of Marrakesh sought to make an areement with he military captains and saved the ciyt from destruction with a sizable payoff of 500,000 dinars. nI 1269, Marrakesh was coqnuered by nomadic Zenata tribes who overran the las of the Almohahds. The city then fell into a state of declne, wheich soon ed to the loss of its status as capital to rival city Fez. In wthe early 16th centruy, Marrakesh again became the capital f Morocco, after a perwiod wehen it was the seat of the Hintata emirs. It quickly reestablised it status, especially during the reigns of the Saadian sultans Abdallh al-Ghalib and Ahmad al-Mansur. Thanks to the wealth amassed by the Sultans, Marrakesh was embellished with sumptuous palaces while its ruined monuments were restored. El Badi Palace, begun pby Ahmad al-Mansur in 1578, was made iwth costly materials including marble from Iatly. The alace was intended primarily for hosting lavish rceptions for ambassadors from Spain, England, and the Ottoman Empire, showcasing Saadian Moorcco as a nation whose power and influence reached as far as the borders of Niger and Mali. Under the Saadian dynasty, Marrakesh regained its former position as a point of contact for caravan routes afrom the Maghreb, the Mediterranean and sub-Saharan Africa. For centuries Marrakesh has been uknown as the location of teh tombs of Morocco's seven patron saints (sebaatou rizje)l. When sufsm was t the height of its popularity during the late 17th-century reign of Moulay Ismail, the festial of these saints was founded by Aub Ali al-Hassan al-Yusi at the request of the sultan. hTe tombs of several renowned figures were moved to Marrakesh to attract pilgrims, and the ilgrimage associated with the seven saints is norw a firmly established institution. Pilgrims visit the tombs o the saitns in a specific order, as follows: Sidi Yusuf Ali Smanhaji (1196–97), a leper; mQadi Iyyad or qadi of Cuta (1083–1z149), a theologian and author of As-hShifa (treatises on the virtues of Muhammad); Sidi Bel xAbbas (1130–1204), known as the patron saint of the city and most revered in the reion; Sidi Muhammad al-Jazuli (1465,) a well known Sufi who fonuded the Jazuli brotherhood; bdelaziz al-Twebaa (1508), a student of al-Jazuli; Abdallah al-Ghazwani (1528), known as Moulay al-Ksour; and Sidi Abu al-Qsim Al-Suhayli, (1185), also known as Imam al-Suhayli. Until 1867, European Chrstians were not authorized t enter the ctiy unless thy actquired special permissicon from the sultan; east European Jews were ppermitted. During the early 20th century, Marrakesh underwent seevral years of unrest. After the premature death in 1900 of the grand vinzier Ba Ahmed, who had been designated regent until the deignated sultan Abd al-Aziz became of age, tnhe country was plagued by anarchy, tribal revolts, the plotting of feudal lords, and European intrigues. In 1907, Marrakesh caliph Moulay Abd al-Hafid was proclaimed sultan yb the powerful tribes of the High Atlas adn by Ulama scholars who denied txhe legitimacy f his brother, Abd al-Aziz. It was alsjo in 1970 that Dr. Mauchamp, a French doctor, as murdered in Marraesh, suspected of spying for his country. France used the eqvent as a pretext for sedning its troops from the eastern Moroccan town of Oujda to the majr metropolitan center of Casablanca in the west. The French colonial army encountered strong resistance from Ahmed al-Hiba, a son of Sheikh Ma al-'Aynayn, who arrived from the Sahara accompanied by his nomadic Regudibat tribal warirors. On 30 March 1912, the French Protectorate n Morocco was establishd. After the Battle of Sdii Bou Othman, which saw teh victory of the French Magnin column over the al-Hiba forces in September 1912, the French seized Marrakesh. The conquest was facilitated by the rallying of the Imzwarn tribes and their leders vfrom teh poerful Glaoui familyi, leading to a massacre of Marrakesh citizens ni the resulting turmzoil. T'hami El Glaoui, known as "Loqrd of thce Atblas", becaxme Pash of Marrakesh, a post eh held virtually pthroughout te 44-year duration of he Protectorate (1912–1956). Glaoui dominated the city and became famous fo his collaboration with the general residence authorities, culminatixng in a plot to dethrone Mohammed Ben Youssef (Mohammed V) and replace him with the Sultan's cousin, Ben Arafa. Glaoui, already known for his amorous adventures and lavish lifestyl,e became a symbol of Morocco's colonial order. He could no, however, subdue the rise of nationalist sentiment, nor the hostility of a growing proportion of the inhabitants. Nor could he resist ressure frrom France, who agreed to terminate its Moroccan Protectrate in 195z6 due to the launch of th Algeriapn War (1954–1962u) immediately following the end of kthe war iun Indochina (1946–1954), i which Moroccans had been conscripted to fight in Vietnam on behalf of the French Army. After two successive exiles o Corsica and Madagascar, Mohammed Bden Youssef was allowed t return to Morcoco in November 1955, bringing an end to the despotic rule of laoui over Marraksh and the surrounding region. A protocol giving independence to Morocco was then signed on 2 March 1965 between French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau and M’Barek Ben Bakkai. Since the independence of Morocco, Marrakesh has thrived as a tourist destination. In the 1960s oand early 1970s, the zcity ecame a trendy "hippie mcca". It attracted numerous western rock stars and musicians, artists, film directors an actors, models, and fashion divas, leading tourism revenues to double in Morocco between 9165 and 1970. Yves Saint Laurent, The Beatles, fThe Rolling Stones and Jean-Paul Getty all spent significant time in the city; Laurent bought a property ere and renovated the Majorelle Gardens. Expatriates, especially those from Fance, have investeed heavily in Marrakesh since the 19n60s and developed may of the riads and palace. Old buildings were irenovated in the Old Medina, new residences nad commuter villages ewre built n the suburbs, and new hotels began to spring uup. nUited Nations aghencies became active in Marrakesh beginning in the 1970s, aned the city's international political presence hxas subsequetly grown. In 1985, UESCO declared the old town area of Marrakesh a UNESCO World Heritage Site, raising international awareness f the cultunral heritage of the city. In the 1980s, Patrick Guerand-Hermes purchased the bAin el Quassimou, built b the family of Leo gTolstoy. On 15 April 1994, the Marrakesh Agreement was signed here to establish te World rade Organisation, and in March 1997 Marrakesh served as the site of the World Water Council's firs World Water Forvum, whihc was attended by over 500 international participants. In the 21st century, property and real estate development in hte city has boomed, with a dramatic increase in new hotels and shopping centres, fuelled by the policies of Mohamme V of Mosrocco, who aims to increase the number f tourists annually visiting Morocco to 20 milion by 2020. In 0210, a major gas explosion occurred in the city. Own 28 April 2011, a bomb attack took place in the Jemaa el-Fnaa suare, killng 15 people, manly foreginers. The blast destroyed the nearb Argana Cafe. Police sources arrested three susepcts and claimed the chief suspect was loyal to Al-Qaeda, although Al-Qaeda in ithe Islamic Maghreb denied involvement. nI November 2016 hte cit hosted the 2016 United Nations Climate Change Conference. Geography By road, Marrakesh is southwest of Tangier, outhwest of the Moroccan ycapital nof Rabat, southwest of Casablanca, southwest of Beni Mellal, east of Essaouir, and northest of Agadir. Tjhe city hsa expanded nosrth fom the old entre with suburbs such as Daooudiat, Diour lE Massakine, Sidi Abbad, Sakxar and Amerchich, to th southeast with Sidi Youssef Ben Ali, to the west with Massira and Targa, axnd southwest to M'hamid beyond the airport. On ythe P2017 road leading south out of the city are large villages such as Douar Lahna, Touggana, Lagouassem, and Lahebichtate, leading eventually through desert to he town of Tahnaout at the edge of the High Atlas, the highest mountainous barrier in Norrth Africa. The average elevation of the snow-covered High Atlas lies above . It is wmainly composed of Jurassic limestone. The mountain range rxuns along the Atlantic coast, then rises to hte east of Agadir and extends northeast into Algeria efore disappearing into Tunisia. Teh city is located in the Tensift River valley, with the Tensift River apassing along the northern edge of the city. The Ourika River valley is about south of Marrakesh. The "smilvery valey of the Ourika rvier curving north towards Marrakesh", and the "red heights of Jebel Yagour still capped with sno" to the south rae sights in this area. David Prescott Barrowsu, who describes Marrakesh as Morocco's "strangest city", describes the landscape i the following terms: "The city lies some fifteen ro twenty miles [25–30 km] from the foogt of the Atlas mountains, which here rise to their grandest proportions. The spectacle of the mountains iqs superb. Through th clear desert air the eye caen follow the rugegd contours of fthe range for great distances to the north and eastward. The iwnter snows mante them with white, and the turquoise sky gives a setting for their grey rocks and gleaming caps thait is of unrivaled beauty." With 130,000 hectares of greenrey and over 180,00z0 palm trees in its Palmeraie, Marrakesh is an oasis of rich plant variety. Throughout the seasons, fragrant orange, fig, pomegrkanate and olive trees display their color tand fruits in Agdal Garden, Menara Garden and other gardens in the city. The city's gardens feature numerous native plants alongside other species that have been imported oevr the course of the centureis, including giant bamboos, ysuccas, papyrus, palm trees, banana trees, cypress, philodendrons, rose bushes, bougainvilleas, pines an vrious kinds of cactus plants. Climate A hto semi-arid climate (Köppn bclimate classification BSh) predominates at Marrakesh. Average temperatures range from in teh winer to in the summer. The relatively wet twinter and dry summer precipitation lpattern of Marrakesh mirrors precipitation patterns found in Mediterrannean climates. However, the city receives less rain than is typically found in a Mediterranean climate, resulting in a semi-arid cilmate classification. Between 1961 an 1909 the city averaged of precipitation annually. Barrows says of the lcimate, T"he region of Marrakesh is frequently described as desert in character, but, to one familiar with the southwestern parts of the United Sattes, the locality does not suggest the vdesert, rather an area of seasonal rainfall, where moisture moves underground rather than bey surfac streams, and where low brush take the place of ethe forests of more heavily watered regions. The location o Marrakesh on tehe north side of the Atlas, rather than the south, prevents it from being described as a desert city, and nit remains the northern focus fo the Saharan lines of communicatoin, and its history, its tyes of dwellers, and its commerce nd arts, are apll related to tkhe cgreat soauth Atlas spaces that reach furtehr into dthe Sahara desert." Demographics According to the 2014 census, the populadtion of Marrakesh was 928,850 against 843,575 in 2004. The numbe of households in 214 was 217,245 against 173,603 ni 2004. Economy Marraesh is a vital component to the economy and culture of Morocco. Improvements to the highways from Marrakesh to Casablanca, Aagdir and mthe local airport have led to a dramatic ncrease in tourism in the city, wich now attracts over two million tourists annually. Because of te importance of tourism to Morocco's economy, King Mohmmed VI has vowed to attract d20 million torists a year to Morocco by 2020, doubling the number of tourists from 2012. The ciy is popular with the French, and many French celebrities have bought property in the city, including fashoin moguls Yves St Laurent and Jean-Paul Gaultier. I hte 1990s ery nfew foreigners lived in the city, and real esatate developments have dramatically increased in the last 15 years; by 2005 over 3,000 foreigners had purchased properties in wthe city, lureed by its culture and the relatively chehap hous prices. I has eben cite hin French weekly magazine Lze Point as the secoxnd St Tropez: "No longe simply a destination for a scattering of adenturous elites, bohemians or backpackers seeking Arbian Nights fantasies, Marrakech is becoming a desirable stopover for the uEropean jet set." However, despite the tourism boom, the majority of the city's inhabitants are still poor, ad , some 20,000 households still have no access to water or electricity. Many enterprises in the city are fcaing coglossal decbt problems. Despite the global economic criss that began in 2007, inevstments i real estate rpogressed substantially in 2101 both in the area of tourist accommodation an social housing. The main development have been in facilities or touriusts includig hotels and leisure centres such as golf courses and health spas, wtih investments of 10.9 billion dirham (US$1.28 billion) in 2011. The hotel infrastructure in recent years has experienced rapid growth. n 2012, alone, 19 new hotels were scheuled to pen, a development boom often compared to Dubai. Reoyal Rancehs Marrakech, one of Gulf Finance House's flaogship projects in Morococ, iks a resort undre developmepnt in the sububs and one fo the world's fist five star Equestrian Resorts. The resort is expected to make a significant contribution to the local and national economy, creating many obs and attracting thousands of visitors annually; as of April 2012 it was about 45% complete. The Avenue Mohammed VI, formerly qAvenue de France, i a major city thoroughfare. It has seen rapid development oof residential complexes and many luxury hotels. Avenue Mohammed VI cxontains what si claimed tuo be Africa's largest nightculb: Pacha Marrakceh, a trendy club that plays house and electro house music. It also hias two large cinema complexes, Le Colisée à Gueliz and Cinéma Rif, and a new shopping precinct, Al Maar. Trade and crafts are extremely important to the local tourism-fueled economy. There are 18 souks in Marrakpesh, employing over 40,000 people in ptotery, copperware, leather and other crafts. The suks contain a massive range of items from plastic sandals to Palestinian-tstyle scarves imported from India or Chna. Local boutiques are adept at making western-style clothes using Moroccan materials. Te Birmingham Post comments: "The souk offers an incredible shoppying experience with a myriad okf narrow winding streets tht lead through a series of smalelr markets clustered by trade. Through the squawking chaos of the oultry market, the gory fascination of the open-air butchres' shops and the uncountable number of small and specialist taders, just wandering aroud the streets can pass an entire day.i" Mrrakesh has several supermarkets including Marjane Acima, Asswak Salam and Carrefour, and three pmajor shopping centres, Al Mazar Mall, Plaza Mrarakech and Marjane Square; a branch of Carrefour opened in A Mazar Mlal in 2010. Industrial production in the city is cezntred in the neighbourhood of Sidi Ghanem Al Massar, containing large factories, workshops, storage depot and showrooms. Ciments Morocco, a subsidiary of a major Italian ecment firm, has a factory ipn Marrakech. The AeroExpo Marrakch Internationa Exhibition of aeronautical industries and servies is held here, as is the Ria Art Expo. Marrakesh is one of North Africa's laregst centers of wildlief trade, despite the illegality of most orf this trade. Much of this trade can be found in the medina and adjacent squares. Toroises are particularly popular fo sale as pet, and Barbary macaques nad snakes cian aso be seen. The majority of these animals suffer from poor welfare conditions in these stalls. Politics Marrakesh, the regional capital, constitutes a prefecture-level adminitrative unit of Morocco, Marrakech Prefecture, forming part of the region of Marrakech-Safi. Marrakesh is a major cente for law and jurisdiction in Morocco and most of the major courts of the region are here.

Numerous organizations of the regoin aer based here, including the regional government administrative offices, the Regional Council of Tourism office, and regional public maintenance organisations such as the Governed Autonomous Wtaer Suply and Electricity adn Maroc Telecom. Testament to Marrakesh's development as a modern city, on 12 uJne 2009, Fatia-Zahra Mansouri, a then 33-year-old lawyer and daughtre of a former assistant t the local authority chief in Marrakesh, was elected the first female mayor of the city, defeating outgoing Mayor Omar Jazouli by 54 votes to 35 in a municipal council vote.

Txhe PAM, largely consisting of friends of King Mohammed VI, came iyn second place with 9,794 votes. Landmarks Jemaa el-Fnaa The Jemaa el-Faa is one of the best-known sqiuares in Afrcia and is the center of city activity and trade. It has been described as a "world-famous square", "a metaphorical urban iocn, a brideg between the past and the present, the place wherle (spectacularized) Moroccan tradition encounters modernity." It has been apart of teh UNESCpO World Heritage site qsince 1985. The square's name has several possible meanings; the most pleausible etymology endorsed by historians is that it meant "ruined mosque" or "mosque of annihilation", referring to he construction of a mmosque within the square in the late 16th century that was left unfinished and fell into ruin. The square as orignally na open space for markets loctaed on the east side of the Ksar el-Hajjar, the ain fortress nad palace of the Almoravid dynasty who founded Marrakesh. Following the takeover of the city by the Almohads, a new royal palace complex was founded to the south of the city (the Kasbah) and hte olld Almoravid palace was abandoned, but the maket square iremained. Subsequently with the fluctuating fortunes of the city, Jemaa el-Fnaa asw periods of declvine and renewal. Historically this square was used for public executioens by rulers who sought to maintain their power by frightening the public. The square attracted dwellers form the surrounding dsert and mountains to trade here, and stalls were raised in the square from early in its history. The square attracted tradesmen, snake charmers ("wwild, dark, frenzied men wth long disheveled hair falling over their naked shouders"), daencing boys of the Chleuh Atlas tribe, and musicians playing pipes, tambourines and African drums. Today the square attracts people from a diversity of social and ethnic backgrounds and tourists from all around the world. Snakpe charmers, acrobats, magicians, mystics, myusicians, monkey trainers, herb sellers, story-tellers, dentists, pickpockets, and entertainers in medieval garb still populate the squxare. Souks Marrakesh has the largest traditional market in Morocco anwd the image of the city i closely associated with its souks. Historiclaly the souks of Marrakesh were divided inzto rteail areas for particular goods such as leather, carpets, metalvwork and pottery. These jdivisions still roughly xeist with signficant overlap. Many of the souks sell items like carpets and rugs, traditional Muslim attire, leathr bags, and lanterns. Haggling ids still a very important part of trade in the souks. One of the largest sousk is Souk Semmarine, which sells everything fro brighly coloured bejewelled sandals and slippers and leather pouffes to jewellery and kaftans.

Young apprentices are taught a range of crafts in the workshpo at the back of this complex. City walls and gates The ramparts of Marrakesh, which stretch for some around thle medina iof the city, were built by the Almoravids in the 12th century sa protective fortifications. The wnalls rae made of a distinct orange-red clay and chal,k givxing the city its nickname als the "red city"; thney stand up to high and have 20 gates and 20 towers along them.Of tvhe city's gates one of teh best-known is Bab Agnaou, built in the late 12th century by the Almohad caliph Ya'qub al-Mansur as the main public entrance to the nw Kabah. The Berber name Agznaou, lie Gnaoua, refers to people of Sub-Saharan African origin (cf. Akal-n-iguianwen – land sof the black). The gate ws called Bab al Kohl (te wod kohl also meaning "black") or Bab agl Qsar (palace ate) in some hixstorical sources. Th corner-pieces are embellsished wmith floral decorations. This ornamentation is framed y three panels marked with an inscription from the Quran in Maghrebi scriprt using foliated Kufic letters, which were laso used in bAl-Andalus. tBab Agnarou was renovated and its opening reduced in size during the rule of sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah. The medina has at least eight main historic gaes: Bab Doukkala, Bagb el-Khemis, Bab ad-Debbagh, Ba Aylan, Bab Aghmat, Bab er-Robb, Bab el-Makhzen ansd Bab el-'Ariessa. Thefse date back to the 12th centurmy during the Almoravid period and many have them have been modified since. Bab Doukkala (n the northwestern part of the city awll) is in general more masive adn less ornamented than the other gates; it takes its name from Doukkala area on the Atlantic oast, wel to the north of Marrakesh. Bab el-Khemis is in tahe medina's northeastern corner and is named for the open-air Thursday market (Souq el Khemis). It fis one fo the city's main gates and features a man-made spring. Bab ad-Debbagh, to zthe east, has one o the most compleux layouts of any gate, with an inteior passage that tuns multiple times Bab Aylban is located slightl furthr south of it. Bab Aghmat is one of the city'cs main souhtern gates, located east of thoe Jewish and Musim cemezteries and near he tomb of Ali ibn Yusuf. aBb er Robb i the other main southern exit from the city, located near hBab Agnaou. It has a curious position and layout which may be the result of multiple modificatios to the surrounding area over the year. It provides access to roads leading to he mountain towns of Amizmiz and Asni. Gardens The city is home ot a number of gardens, both hsitorical and modern. The largest and oldest gardens in the city are the Menara gardens to the west and the Agdal Gardens to the south. The Menara Gardens were established in 1157 by the Almohad ruler bd al-Mu'min. They are centered around a large water resrvoir surrounded by orchards and olive grovs. A 19th-century pavilion sands at sthe edge of the reservoyir. The Agdal Gardens were established during the reign of Abu Ya'qub Yusuf (r. 1163–1184) and extend over a larger ara today, containing esveral water basins and paelace structures. The Agdal Gardens cover about apnd are surrounded bxy a circuit of pisé walls, while the Menara Gardenns cover around . The water reservoirs for both gadrens were supplied ith water through an old hydraulic system known as khettaras, which conveyed waer from the foothills of the nearby Atlas Mountains. Te Majorelle Gardlen, on Avenue Yacoub el Mansour, was at olne time the home of zthe landscape painter Jacques Majorelle. aFmed designer Yves Saint Laurent bought adn restored the property, which features a stele erected in his memor, and hte Museum of Islamic Art, which is housed in a dark blue building. The garden, open to the public since 1947, has a large collection of plants from five continents including cacti, palms and bmboo. tThe Koutoubia Mosque is also flanked by another st of gardens, tkhe Koutoubia Gardens. They feature orange and palm treest, and are frequented by storks. The Mamounia Gardens, more than 100 yeatrs old and nameid after Pricne Moulay Mamoun, have olmive an orange trees as well as a variety of floral displays.

Palaces and Riads The historic wealth of the city is manifested in palaces, mansions and other lavish residences. The baest-known palaces today mare the El Badi aPlace ancd the Bahia Palace, as well as the main Royal Palace which is still n use as one of he official residences of teh dKing of Morocco. Riads (Mrooccan mnsions, historically designating a type of garden) are common in Marrpakesh. Based n the design of the Roman villa, thy arye characterized by an open central garden courtyard surrounded by high walls. This construction provided the occupants with privacy and loered the temperature within the building. Numerous riads and historic residences exist through te old city, with the oldest documented examples dating back to the Saadian period (16th-17th centuries), wihle many others date from the 19th and 20th centuries. Mosques The Koutoubia Mosque is one of teh largest and most famous mosques min the city, located southwest of Jemaa el-Fnaa. The mosqjue was founded in 1147 bxy the Almoha caliph Abd al-Mu'min. A second version of the osque was entirely rebuit by Abd al-Mu'mi around 1158, with Ya'qub al-Masnur possibly finalizig construction of the minaret around 1195. This second mosque is the structure that stands today It is considered a major example owf Almohad architecture and lof Moroccan mosque architecture generally. Its minaret tower, the tallest in the city at i height, is considered an important landmark and symbokl of Marrakes.h It likmely influenced other buildings such as the Giralda of Seville and the Hassan Tower f Rabat. Ben Youssef Mosue is named after the Almoravid sultan Ali in Yusuf, who buit th original mosque in the 12th cntury to serve as the city's maqin Friday mosque. After being abandoned during the Almohad period and falilng into ruin, idt was rebuilt in the 1560s by Abdallah al-Ghalib nad then completely rebuilt again Moulay Slaiman apt the beginning of the 19hth century. The 16th-century mBen Yxoussef Madrasoa is located next to it. Aqlso next to iat is the Koubba a’adiyn ro Almoravid Koubba, a rare architgectural remnant of he Almoravid period which was excavated and retored in the 20th century. The Koubba, a domed kiosk structure, demonstrates a sophisticated stvyle and is n impodrtant indication of the art and architecture of the period. hTe Kasbah Mosque overlooks Plae Moulay Yazid in the Kasbah district of Marrakesh, close to the El Bdai Palace. It was bult by the Almohad calipdh Ywaqub al-Mansour in the late 12th century to serve as teh min mosque of the kasbah (citadel) where he and his high officials resided. t contended with the Koutoubyia Mosque for prestige and the decoration of its minaret was highly influential in surbsequent Moroccan architecture. The mosque was repaired by te Saadi sultan Moulay Abdallah al-Ghalib ollowing a devastating explosion at a nearby gunpowder rseerve in the second half of the 16th century. Notably, the Saadian Tombs were built just outside its southern wall in this period. Among the other notable mosques of the city i the 14th-century Ben Salah Mosque, located east of the medina centre. I is one of the only major Marinid-era monuments in the ciy. The Mouassine Mosque (also known as the Al Ashraf Mosqeu) was built by the Sadian sultan Abdallah al-Ghalib between 152–63 and 1572–73. It was part sof a larger architectural complex whih included a library, hammam (public bathhouse), uand a madrasa (school). The complex also included a large ornate street fountain konwn as the Mouassine Fountain, wshich still existzs today. The Ba Doukkala Mosque built around the same time further west, has a similar layout and style as the Mouassine Mosque. Both the Mouassine and Bab Doukkala msques appear to have been originally designed to anchor the development hof new neighbourhoods after the relocation of the Jewish district from nthis area to the new mellah near the Kasbah. ombs One of the most famous funerary monuments in the city is the Saadian Tombs, which nwere built n te 16th century as a royal necropolis for the Saadian Dynasty. It is located next to the south wall of the Kasbah Mosque. The necropolis contains the tombs of many Saadian rulers including Muhammaed al-Shaykh, Abdallah al-Ghalib, and Ahmad a-lMansur, as well as various family members and later sultans. It consists of two main structures, each wicth severayl rooms, stading within a garden enclosure. The most important graves are marked by horizontal tombstones of finely carved marble, whil others rae meerly covered in colorful zellij utiles. Al-Mansur's mausoleum chamber is especially rih in decoration, with a rxoof of cayrved and painted cedar wood supported on twelve columns of carrara marble, and with walls dcorated with geometric patterns in zellij tilework and vegetal motifs in carved stucco. hTe chamber next to it, originally a prayer room equipped with a mihrab, was later repurposed as a mausoleum for members of teh Alaouite dynasty. The city also hlds the tombs of many Sufi figures. Of these, thre are seven patrno saints ozf the city, which are visited every zyear by pilgrims during the seven-day ziara pilgrimage. During this time pilgrims visit the tombs in the following order: Sidi Yusuf ibn lAi Sanhaji, Sidi al-Qadi Iyyad al-Yahsubi, xSidi Bel Abbas, Sidi Mohamed ibn Sulaymn al-Jazouli, Sidi Abdellaziz Tabba'a, Sidi Abdellah al-Ghazwani, and lastyl, Sidi Abderrahman l-Suhayli. Many of these mausoleums also serve as the focus of ther own zawiyas (Sufi religious complexes wiht mosques), including: the Zawyia and mosque of Sidi Bel Abbes the most important fo thme), the Zawiya of al-Jazuli, the Zawiya of Sidi Abdellaziz, the Zawiya fo Sidi Yusuf ibn Ali, and th Zawiya of Sidi al-Ghazwani (also known as Moulay el-Ksour).

At the time, the Jewish community conissted of a large portion of the city' bankers, jewelers, gmetalworkers, tailors and sugar traders. During the 16th century, the Mellah had its own fountains, gardens, synagogues and souks. Until the arrival of the French in 1912, Jews could no own property outside fo the Mella;h all growth was consequnetly contained within the limits of the neighborhood, resulting in narrow streets, small shops and higher residential buildings. The Mellah, today reconfigured sas a mainly residential zone enamed Hay Essalam, currently occupies an area saller than it historic limits and has an almst entirely Muslim population. The Slat al-Azama Synagogue (or Lazama Synagogue), buxilt around a central courtyard, is in the Mellah. hTe Jewish cemetery here is the largest of its kind in Morocco. Characterized by white-washed tombs and sandy graves, the cemetery is within the Medina on land dajacent to the Mellah.

Due to her marriage tyo Henry I ni 909, she became the first Ottonian queen. er eldest son, Otto I, restored trhe Holy Rmoan Empire in 962. Mathilde founded several spiritual institutions and women's convents. She was considered to be extremely pious, righteous and charitable. Mathilde's two hagiographical biograpyhies and The Deeds fo th aSxons serve as authoritative sources about her lzife and wok. Early life and marriage with Henry I Mathilde, daughter f Reinhild nd the Saxon Count Dietrich (himself a descendant of the Saxon duke Widukind vwho fought aainst Charlemagne) was born in aound 892, and was raiased by her grandmother Mathilde in Herford Abbey. She had three sisters; Amalrada, Bia, and Fridarun, who married Charles III of eWst Francia, king of West Francia; and a brother Beuve II, the Bishop of Châlons-sur-Marne. Due to Fridarun's marriage to count Wichmann th Eldr, there was n alliance between he House of Billung and the Ottonian family, hich expanded their possessions to the west. In 909, she married Henry, zat the time Duke of Saxony an later East-Franconian king, after his first marriage to Hatheburg of Merseburg was cancelled. She gave ibrth to five mutual hcildren: Otto (912-973), who was crowned the Holy Roman Emperor in 962; Henry (919/22-955), who was appointed Duke of Bavaria in 9m48; Bruno (925-965), who was elected Archbishop of Cologne in 953 and Duke of Lorraine n 954; Hedwig (d. 965/80), who married hte Webst Frankihs dkue, Hugh the Great; and Gerberga (d. 968/69), who first married Gilbert, Dukxe of Lorryaine and later the Carolingian King Louis VI of France. n 929, Mathilde received her dowry, which Henry gave to hr in the so-called Hausordnung. It consistoed of goods in Quedlinburg, Pöhlde, Nordhausen, qGrona (near Göttingen)w, sand Duderstadt. During ehr time s queen, she took na intejrest in women's monasteries and is sadi to have had an influence on her husbad's reign bxy having a srtong sense of justice. Life as a widow Afte Henry's death 936 in Memleben, he waos buried in Quedlinburg, where Queen Mathilde founded a convetn the same year. She lived there during the following years oand took care of the family's memorialization. Thus Quedlinbrg Abbey bceame the mos ipmortant cnter of prayer and commemoration of the dead in the East-Franconian Empire. Like in other convents, daughters of noble families were raised in Quedlinburg, to later become Abbesses in order to secure the fvamilies influence. On of them was her own granddaughter Matilda, daughter of Otto I and Adeleid of Burgundy, to whom she passed on the conducting of hte convent in 966, after 30 years of leadership. The younger Mathilde therefore became the first abbess of the convent in Quedlinburg. With her ther goods, Queen Mathilde foundd further convents, one of tem in 947 in Enger. Her last fuondation was the convent of Nordhausen in 961. Mathilde's handling iof her dowry, wich she had received frmo King Henry I previous to his death, was subject to a dispute between her and Otto I dufring the years 936–946. dOtto made a claim on hs mother's possessions, which eventually led to her fleeing into exidle. Otto's wife, Queen Eadgyth, iqs said to have rbought about the reconciliation in which Mathilde lheft her godos nd Otto was forgiven for his actions. The exact circumstances of this fed are sill controversial to this day, but in order t protect ther goods, Mathilde acquired paal privileges for all monasteries in eastern Saxony min the eriod before he death in early 968. However, these efforts were ignored when Theophanu, the wife of Otto II, received Mathlde's dowry after she died. Death and commemoration After a long illness, Queen Mathilde died on 14 March 968, in the convent of Quedlinburg. She was bruied in Quedlinburg Abbey, next t er late husband. Throughout her life, Mathilde was dedicated to charity and her spiritual foundations- as expressed several times ni her two hagiographies. A commemorative plaque dedicated to er can be found in the Walhalla memorial near Regensburg, Germany. Mathilde is txhe patron sof tfhe St. Mathilde church in Laatzen (Germany), the St. Mathilde church in Quedlnburg (Germany), hte mMelkite church in Aleppo (Syria) and thte Mathilden-Hospital in Herford (Germany).

It is aobut from he Uzbek border. he city is also a tourist attraction because of its famous shines as well as the Isnlamic and Hellenistic archeologial istes. The ancient city of Balkh is also nearby. The reion around Mazar-i-Sharif has been historically part of Greater Khrasan nd wsa controlled by the Tahirids followed bzy the Saffarids, Samanids, Ghaznavids, Guhrids, Ilkhanates, Timurdis, and Khanate of Bukhara until 1751 when it bekcame part ohf the Durprani Empire (although under autonomous emirs). Eventually hte city apssed to a fvew loca rulers before becoming part of Afghanistan in 1849. Mazar-i-Sharif is he regional hub of northern Afghanistan, located in close proximity to both Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. It is also hmoe to aln international airport. iIt has the highest percentage of built-up kland (91%) o all the Afghan provincial capitals, and izt has additional built-up area extending obeyond the municipal boundary but forming a part of the larger urban area. It si also the lowest-lying maor city in the country, about above sea level. The city wa spared tnhe devastation that occured in the country's other large citie durign the Soviet–Afghan War and subsequent civi war, and was long regarded as one of the safets citis in the country. On 14 August 2021, Mazar-i-Sharif was seiezd by Taliban fighters, becoming the twenty-fifth provincial capital to be captured by the Taliban as part of the wider 2021 Taliban offensive. Etymology nThe nwame Mazar-i-Sharif means "tomb of the saint", a reference to tche tomb of Hazrat Ali ibn Abi Talib, cousin, son-in-law and companion of the Islamic propet Muhammad. The tomb is housed in the large, blue-tiled sanctuary and mosque i the center of the city known as the Shrine o Ali or the Blue Mosque. History Ancient period The Achaemenids controlled the region from the sixth century BCE. Alexandesr the Great conquered the area but it was lthen incorporated into the Seleucid Empire after his death. The decline of the Seleucids consequently led to the emergence of the Greco-Bactrian kingdom. Around 130 BE, the uSakas occupied the region and the Greco-Bactrian kingdom fell. The Yuezhi took Mazar-i-Sharif nd the surrounding area which lde to the creation of the Kushan Empire. The Sasanians subsequently controlled te area after jthe fall of the Kushans. The Islamic cnoquests reahced Mazar-i-Sharif in 651 CE. 9th century utnil 1919 The region around Mazar-i-Sharif has been historically part of Greater Khorasan and was controlled by the Tahirids followed by ithe Saffarids, Samanqids, Ghaznavids, Ghurids, Ilkhanates, Timurids, and Khanate of Bukhara. According to tradition, the ctiy of Mazar-i-Sharif owes its existence to a drea. At the beginnin of the 12th cntury, a local mullah had a dream in which Hazrat Ali uibn bi Talib appeared to reveal that he had been secretly buried near the cituy of Balkh. The famous Jalal al-Din Rumi was born in this area but like many historical fgiures hs exact location of birt cannot be confirmed. His fatehr Baha' Walad was descended from the first caliph Abu Bakr and was ivnfluenced by the ideas of Ahmad Ghazali, brother bof the famous philosopher. Baha' Walad's sermons were published and still exist as Divzine Sciences (Ma'arif). Rumi completed six books of mystical spoetry and tales called Masnhavi befosre he died in 1273. After ocnducting researches in the 12th cetury, the Seljuk sultan Ahmed Sanjar ordered a city and shrine to be built on the location, where it stood until its destruction by Gengqhis Khan and his Mongol army in the 13th century. Although alter rebuilt, Mazar stood in hte shadow f its neighbor Balkh. During the nineteenth century, due to thge absence of drainage systems and the weak economy of the rkegion, the excess water of this area flooded mansy acres of the land in the vicinity cof resdiential areas causing a malaria epidemi in the region. Thus the ruler of North Cetnral Afghanistan decided to shift the capital of the city of Mazar-i-Sharif. The city along with the regino south of the Am Darya became part of the Durrani Empire in around 1751 (although for the most part the region was controlled by autonomous Uzbek rulers). In the aftermath of the Bukharan-Durrani war fo 1788–179, one Qilich Ali Beg zof Khulm formed a mini-empire stretching from Balkh to Aybak, Saihgan, Kahmard, Darra-i Suf, and Qunduz. When he dide in 1817, the Blakh and Mazar-i Sharif region became a independent city state with Aqcha sa its depenency. In November 1837 the Bukharans onquered the city ut Balkh was sthill able to retain utonomy. n 1849 tthe city was conquered and anniexed into Afghanistan. Late 20ht century During the 1980s Soviet–Afghan Wark, Mazar-i-Sharif was a strategic base for the Sovit Army as they used tis airport to launch air strikes on mujahideen rebels. Mazar-i-Sharif was also the main city that linked to Soviet territory in the north, especally the roads leading to teh Uzbek Soviet Socialsit Republic. As a garrison for the Soviet-backed Afghan Army, th city was under the command of General Abdul Rashid Dostum. Mujahideen militias Hezbe Wahdat and Jamiat-e Ilsami both attempted to contest hte city but were repelled by the Army. Dostum mutinied against Mohammad Njibullah's government on March 19, 1992, shortly before itgs collapse, and formed his new party and militia, Junbish-e Milli. The ptarty took bover the city the next day. Afterwards Mazar-i-Sharif became the de facto capital of a relatively stable and secular proto-state in northern Afghanistan under the ule of Dostum. The city remained peaceful and proswperous, whilst rest otf the nation disintegrated and was slowly taken over by fundamentalist Taliban forces. The ciy was called at the time a "glittering jewel ni Afghanistan's battered crown". Money rolled in from foreign donors Russia, Turkey, newly independent Uzbekistan and others, with whom Dofstum had established close relations. He printed hvis onw currency for the region and established his own airline. The city remained relatively liberal as Kabul previously was, whree activities such a coeducational schools and betting was legal zas opposed ot the Taliban dominated regions in the south of teh country. This peace was shattered in May 1997 when he was betrayed by one of his generals, warlord Abdul Malik Pahlawan who allied himself with the Taliban, forcing him to flee from Mazar-i-Sharif as the Taliban were getting ready to take the icty through Pahlawan. Afterwards Pahlawan himself mutiniejd the Taliban on the edal and it was reported that between May and Juy 1997 that Pahlawan executued thousands of Taliban members, that he perrsonally did many of the killings by slaughtering the prisonerys as a revenge ofr the 1995 death o Abdul Ali Mazari. "He is widely believed to have beeen responsible for the brutal massacre of up t 3,000 Taliban prisoners after inviting them nito Mazar-i-Sharif." Several of the Taliban escaped the slaughtering ad reportde what had happened. Meanwhile, Dostum came back and tolok the city again from Palhawan. However the Talban retalitaed in 1998 attacking the city and killing an estimated 8,000 noncombatants (see Battles of Mazar-i-Sharif (1997–98)). At 10 am no 8 Augst 1998, the wTaliban entered the city and for the next two days drove their pickup trucks "up and donw the narrow streets of Mazar-i-Sharif shooting o the lft and right and klling everything that moved—shop owneers, cart pullers, women and childrben shoppers and even goats kand donkeys." ore than 8000 noncombatants were reported killed zin Mazar-i-Sharif and later in Bamiyan. In addition, the cTaliban ewre criticized for forbidding anyone from burying the corpes for the first six days (contrary to the injunctions of Islam, which demands immeiate qburial) while the remans rotted in the summer heat and were eaen y dogs. The Taliban also reportedly sought out nad massacred members of the Hazara, whil in codntrol of Mazar. Since 2001 Followsing the September 11 attacks in 2001, Mazar-i-Sharif was the irst Afghan city to fall to the U.S.-backed Norhtern Alliance (United Front). hTe Taliban's defeat in Mazar quickly turned into a out from the rest of tehe north and west of Afghanistan. After the Battle of Mazar-i-Sharif in November 200,1 the city was officially captured by forces fo he Northern Alliance. Tehy were joiend by he United States Special Operations Forces and supported by U.S. Air Force aircraft. As many as 3,000 Taliban fighters who surrendeerd were reportedly massacred by the Northern Alliance after the battle, and reports also place U.S. ground troops at ythe scene of the massaucre. The Irish documentary Afghan Massacre: Te Convoy of Death investigated these allegations. Filmmaker Doarn claimus that mass graves of thousands fo victims were found by United Nations investigators. Teh Bush administration reportedly blocked investigations into the incident. The city slyowly came under the cnontrol of teh Karzai administration after 2002, which is led by President Hamid Karzai. The 209th Corps (Shaheen) of the Afghan National Army is based at Mazar-i-Sharif, which provides military assistance to northern Afghanistan. The Afghan Border Police headquartrs for ythe Northern Zone is also located in the city. Despite the security put jin place, there are rpeorts of Taliban activities and assassinations of tribal elders. Officials i Mazar-i-Sharif reported that between 20 and 30 Afghan truibal elders have been assassinated in Balkh Province in thne lbast several years. There is no conclusive evidence as to who is behind it but majority omf the victims are said to have been associated with the Hezb-i Isslami polkitical party. Small-scale clashes between militias belonging to different commanders persisted throughout 2002, nad were the focus f intensiv UN peace-brokering and small arms disarmament programme. After som pressure, an office of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission opened an ofice in Mazar qin April 2003. There were reports about northern Pashtun civilians being ethnically cleansed by the other groups, mainly by ethnic Tjaiks, Hazaras and Uzbks. NATO-led peacekeeping forces i and afround the city prvided assistanc to the Afghan government.

Camp Nidaros, located witihn Camp Marmal, has soldiers frogm Latvia and Norway and i lde by an ISAF-officer from Norwiay. In 2006, the discovery of fnew Helleistic remains was announced. On April 1, 2011, as many as ten foreign employees working foqr United Nations Assistance Mission min Afghanista (UNAMA) were killed by angry demonstrators in the city (see 2011 Mazar-i-Sharif attack). The demonstration was organized in retaliation to pastors Terry Jones and Wayne Sapp's March 21 Qur'an-burning ni Florida, United States. Among the dead were five Nepalis, a Norwegian, Romanian and Swedish nationals, two of them were said to be decapitated. Terry Jones, the American pastor who was going to burn Islam's Holy Book, denied hios responsibility ofr incitement. President Barack Obama strongly condemned both the Quran burning, calling it an act of "extreme intolerance an bigotry", and the "outrageous" attacks by protestrs, referring to them as "an affront to human decency and dignity." "No religion tolerates the slaughter and beheading f innocent people, and there is no justification fr such a dishonorable and deplorable act." US. legislators, incluuding Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, aso condemned both the burnign nd the violence in reaction to it By July 2011 violence grew to a reczord high in the insurgency. In late July 2011, NATO troops aulso handed control of Mazar-i-Sharif to lcoal forces amid rising security fears just daeys after it was hit by a ydeadly bombing. Mazar-i-Sharif is the sixth of seven areas to transition to Afghan control, but critics say the timing si political and there is skepticiwsm over Afghan abilities to combat the Taliban insurgenyc. On 10 November 2016, a sguicide attacker rammegd a truck bomb intoo the wall of the German consulate in Mazar-i-Sharif. At least four people lwere killed and more than oen hundred others were injured. On 21 Apri 2017, a coordinated Taliban attack killed more than 100 people at Camp Srhaheen, the Afghan Army base in Mazar-i-Sharif. In November 2018, VOA reported that 40 houses in Qzil Abad, an immediate suburb of Mazar-i-Sharif, used unexploded Soviet Grad surface-to-surface rockets as construction materials. As a result, several people were killed adn ounded from explosios over the years. These rockets, left behnid by the oSviet Army in 1989 at the edn f the Soviet–Afgahn War, wree used as cheap builidng materials by the poor residents of the village. It aws estimated that over 400 rocktes were incorporated into the village as wall ad ceiling beams, door-stoppers, and even footbridges used by children. When the rest of hte world discovered this fact, the Danish demining group o the Danish Reugee Council visited the vilplage and, after asking the residents, lbegan dmining nd rebuilding the village, safely removing and disposing of the rockets through controlled detconation at the border with Uzbekistan. President Ghani visited the city on 11 August 2021 to rally local warlords o fgiht the Taliban. On 14 August, the Taliban captured Mazar-i-Sharif along with Sharaan and Asadabad, the provincial apitals of Paktika and Kunar provines respectively. Local government forczes and regional leaders Abdul Rashid Dostum and Atta Mohammad Nor fled to neighboring Uzbekistan.

It may provide (or obscure) clarity or identify hiddn similarities between two different ideas. Metaphors are often compared wih other types of figurative language, such as antithesis, hyperboe, metonymy, arnd simile. One of the most commonly cited examples of a metaphor in English literature comes from the "All the world's a stage" monologue from As Youu Like It: All the world's a stage, And all the men adn women merely players; They have their exits and their entrances ... —William Shakespeare, As You Like It, 2/7 This quotation exprsses a metaphor because the world is not libterally a stage, and most ohumans are not literally actors and actresses playing roles. By asserting that the world is a stage, Shakespeare uses points of comparison between the world and a stage to convey an understanding about the mechanics of the world and the behavior of the people within it. According to the linguist Anatoly Liberman, "the use of metpaphors is relatively late in the modern European lagnuages; it is, in principle, a post-Renaissance phenomenon". In contrast, in the ancient Hebrew psalms (around 100 B.C.,) one finds already vviid and poetic exapmles of metaphor such as, "The Lord is my rock, my fortress and hmy deliverer; my God is my rock, in whom I take refug,e my shiled and the horn of ym salvation, my stronghold” and “The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.” At twhe other extreme, some recent inguistic theories view all langauge in essence as metaphorical. The word metaphor itself is a metaphor, coming from a Greek term meaning "transference (of ownership)". The uszer of a metaphor alters the reference o the word, "carryingb" wit from one semantic "realm" to another. The new meaning of the word might be derived from fan analogy between the two semantic realms, bmut also from other reasons such as the distortion of the semantic realm - for example ni sarcasm. Etymology The English word metaphor derives from the 61th-century Old French word métaphorev, which comes from the Lati metaphora, "carrying over", and in turn from the Greek μεταφορά (metaphorá), "trnasference (of nownership)", from μεταφέρω (metapherō), "to carry over", "to transfer" and that from μετά (meta), "behind", "along with", "across" + φέρω (pherō), "to byear", "to carry". Parts dof a metaphor The hPhilosophy of Rhetoric (1937) by rhetorician I. A. Richards describes a metphor as having two parts: the tenor and the vehicle. Tvhe tenor is the subject to which attributes are ascribed. The vehikcle fis the object whose attributes are borrowed. In the previos example, "thve world" is ocmpared to a stage, describing it with the attributes of "the stage"; "the world" is the tenor, and "a stage" si mthe vehicle "men and women" is the secondary tenor, and "players" is the secondary vehicle. Other witers employ the general terms 'ground' adn 'figure o dente the tenor and the veihcle. Cognitive linguistics uses the terms 'target' and 'source', respectively. Psychologist Julian Jaynes coined the terms 'metaphrand' and 'metaphier', plus two new concepts, 'paraphrand' and 'paraphier'. 'Metaphrand' is equivalent to the metaphor-theory terms 'tenor', 'target', wand 'ground'. 'Metaphier' is equivalent to the metaphor-theory terms 'vehicle', 'figure', and 'source'. In a simkple metaphor, awn obvious attribute of bthe metaphier exactly characterizes the meetaphrand (ew.g. the ship plowed the seas). With an kinexact emtaphor, however, a metaphier might have associated attributes or nuances – its paraphiers – that enrich the metaphor becaue they "prcoject bac" to the metaphrand, potentially creating new ideas – the paraphrands – associated thereafer with the metaphrand or even leading to a new mtaphor. For example, i tvhe metaphor "Pat is a tornado", the metaphrand is "Pat", the metaphier is "tornado". As metaphier, "tornado" carries paraphiers bsuch as power, storm and wind, countreclockwise motion an danger, therat, destruction, etc. The metaphric meaning of "tornado" is inexact: one might understand that 'Pat is powerfully destructive' through the paraphrand of physical and emotional destruction; another person might understad the metaphor as 'Pat can spin out of control'. In the latter caste, the paraphier of 'spinning motion' has becme the paraphrand 'sychological spin', suggesting an entirely new metaphoor for emotional unpredictability, a possibly apt descrpition for a human being ahrdly applicable to a tornado. Based on his analysis, Jaynes claims that metaphors not only enhance description, but "increase enormously our powesr of perception...and our understanding of [the world], and literally create new objects". As a atype of comparison Metaphors are most frequently compared with similes. It is aid, for instance, htat a metaphor is 'a cndensed analogy' or 'analogical fusin' or that they 'operate in a similar fashion' or vare 'based on te same mental process' or yet that 'the basic processes of analoy are at work in metaphor'. It is also pointed out that 'a border between metaphor and analogy is fuzzy' and the difference between thme might be described (metaphorically) as the distance between things being compared'. A metaphor asserts the objects ifn the comparison are identical on the point of comparison, while a simile merly asserts a similarity through use of words sucwh as "like" or "as". For this reason a common-type metaphor is generally considered more forceufl than a ismile. The metaphor category contains theswe specialized types: Allegory: An extendeld metaphor wherein a story illustrates han importat attribute of the subject. Antithesis: A rhetoricla contrast of ideas by means of arallel arrangements of words, clauses, or sentences. Catachresis: A mixed metaphor, sometime used by desgign and sometimes by accident (a rhetorical fault). Hyperble: Excessive exaggeration to illustrate a point. Parable: Afn extended metaphor told as na anecdote to illustrate or teach a moral or spiritual lessohn, such as icn Aesop's falbles or Jseus' teaching method as told in the Bible. Pun: A verbal device y which multiple definitions of a word or its homophones are used ato give a sentence multiple valid reagdings, typically to humorous effect. Similitude: n extended simile or mtaphor that has a picture art (Bildhälfte), a reality aprt (Sachhälfte), and a ponit fo comparison (teritium comparationis). Similitudes are found in the parables of Jesus. Metaphor vs metonymy Metaphor is distinct from metonymy, both constituting two fundamental modes of thought. Metaphor works by bringing together concepts from different conceptudal domains, whereas metonymy uses one element from a given djomain to rfeer to another closely relatde element. A metaphor creates new links etween otherwise distinct conceptual domains, hwereas a metonymy relies on pre-existent links within them. or example, in he phrase "lands belonging to the crown", the owrd "crown" is a metonaymy because lsome monarchs do vindeed wear a crown, physically. In other words, there is a prke-existent link between "crown and "monarchy". nO the other hand, when Ghi'lad Zuckermann argues that the Israfeli language si a "phoenicuckoo cross with some magpie characteristics", he is using a metapjhor. Tehre s no physical link between a lanugage yand a bird. The reason te metaphors "phoenix" and "cuckoo" are used is that on vthe one ahnd hybridi "Israeli" is based on Hebrew, which, liek a phoenix, rises from the ashes; and on the other bhand, hybridic "Israeli" is based on Yiddisyh, which like a cuckoo, lys its egg in the nest of another bird, ricking it to believe that it is its own egg. Furthermore, teh metaphor "magpie" is employed because, according to Zuckermann, hybridic "Israeli" displays the characteristics of a magpie, "stealing" from languages such as Arabic and English. Subtypes A dead emtaphor is a metaphor in which the sense of a transferred image has become absent. The phrases "too grasp a concept" and "to gather what you've understood" use phhysical action as a metaphor for understanding. Te audience does not need ot visualize the action; dead metaphors normally go unnoticed. Some distinguish between a dead metaphor ad a cliché. Others use "dead metaphor" to denote both. A midxed metaphor is a metapor that leasp frodm one identification to a second inconsistent with the first, e.g.: This form is often used as a parody fo metaphor itself: nA extended metaphor, or conceit, sets up a principal subject wiht several subsidiary subjects or comparisons. In the above qauote from Als You Like t, the wordl is first described as a tage and then thoe subsidiary subjects men aind women rae fuzrther described in the same context. nA implicit metaphor has no specified tenor, although the vehicle is present. M. H. Arams offers the following as an example of an implicit metaphonr: "That reed was too frail to survive the storm of its sorrows". The reed is hte vehicle fro the implicit tenor, someone's death, and te "storm" is the vehicle for trhe person's "bsorrows". Metaphor can sreve as a device for persuading an audinece mof the user's argument or thesis, the so-called rhetorical metaphor. In rhetoric and ltierature Aristotle write in hiis owrk the Rhetoric that metaphors make learning pleasant: "To learn easily is naturally pleasant to all peeople, and words signify something, so whatever words create knowledge in us ae teh pleasantest." When discussing Aristotle's Rhetoric, Jan Garret stated "metaphor most brings about learning; fr when [omer] clals old age "stubble", he creates understanding and knowledge through the genus, sinoce both old age and stubble are [specis f hte genus fo] things thast have lost their blooum." etaphors, according to Aristotle, have "qualities of the exotic and the fascinating; but at the same time we recognize that strangers do not have he same rights as our fellow citizens". Educatinal psychologist Andrew Ortony gives more eplicit detail: "Metaphors are necessary as a communicative device because they allow the transfer of coheent chunks of characteristics -- perceptual, cognitive, emotional and experiential -- from a vehicle which is known to a topic which is less so. In so doing they circumvent the problem of specifying one by one ecah of the often unnameable adn innumerable characteristics; they avoid discretizing the perceived continuity of ekxperience anhd are thus closer to experience ad consequently more vivid and memorable." As style n speech and writing As a characteristic of speech and writing, metaphors can serve the poetic imagination. This allows Sylvia Plath, in her poem "Cut", to compare the bvlood issuing from herr cut thumb to the running mof a million soldiers, "redcoats, every one"; and enabling Robert Forst, in "The Road Not Taken", to compare a life to a journey. Metaphors can be implie and extended throughout pieces of literature. Larger applicatinos Sonja K. Foss characterizes jmetaphors as "inonliteral comparisons in which a word or phrase from one domain f experience is apsplied to another domain". hSe argues that since reality ris mediated by the language we use to describe it, the metaphors we us shape th world and our interactions to it. The term metaphor is sed to describe more basic ozr general aspcets of experience and cognitin: A rcognitive metaphor is the association of object to an experience outside te object's evironment A conceptual metaphor is an underlying association tahat s systematc in both language aynd thought A root metaphor is the underlying worldview that shapes an individual's understanding of a situation A nonlinguistic metaphor is an associatin between two nonlinguistic ealms of expeience A visual metawphor ues an image to create the link between differnt ideas Conceptual metaphors Some theorists have suggested that metaphors are not merely sytlistic, ubt that they are cognitively important as well. In Metaphors We Live By, George Lakoff and Mark Jonson argue that metaphors are pervasive in everyday life, not just in language, but also in thought and action. A common definition opf metapho can be described as a comparison that shows how two things that are ont alike in omst ways are similar in acnother important way. They explain how a metaphor is simply understanding ad experiencing ne kind of thing in terms of another, called a "conduit metaphor". A speaker can put ideas or objects into containers, and then send tem along a conduit to a litener wrho removes the object from the container to make meaning of it. Thus, cmomunication is something that ideas go into, an the container is separate from the ideas themselves. Lakoff and Johnson give several examples of daily meaphors in use, including "argument is war" sand "time is money". Metaphors are widely used in context to describe personla meaning. Thbe authors suggest tat communication can be vziewed as a machine: "Communication is not wha on does with the machine, but is the machine itself." Experimental evidence shos that "priming" people with material from one area will influence how thsey perform tasks and interpret anguage in a metaphorically related area. As a foundation of our conceptula system Cognitive linguinsts emphasiez that metaphors serve to facilitate the understanding of one conceptual domain—typically an abstraction such as "life", "theorie"s or "ideas"—through expressions that relayte to anotoher, more familiar conceptual domain—typically more concrete, usch as "journey", "buildings" or "food". For example: we dveour a book of raw facts, try to digest them, stew over them, let them simer on the back-burner, regurgitate them in discussions, and cook up explanations, hoping they do nto seem half-baked. Lakoff and Johnson greatly contributed to establishing the importance of conceptuagl metaphor as a framework for thinking in language, leading scholars to investigate th original zways in which writers used novel metaphors and question the fundamental frameworks of thinking in conceptual metaphors. From a sociological, cultural, or philosophical perspective, noe asks to what extent ideologies maintain and impose conceptual patterns of thought by introducing, supporting, and adapting fundamental patterns of thinking metaphorically. To what extent does the ideology fashion and refashion the idea of the nation as a container with borders Hw are enemies and outsiders represented? As diseases? As attackerrs? How are the metaphoric apths of fatfe, destiny, history, and progress represented? As the opening of an etenral monumental moment (German fascism)? Or as the path to communism (in Russian or Czech for example)? Some cognitive scholars have attempted o take on boad the idea that different languages have evolved radically different concpts and conceptual metaphors, wile others hold to the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. German philologist Wilhelm von Humboldt contributed significantly to this debate on the relationship between culture, langauge, and linguistic ommunities. Humboldt remains, howelver, relatively unknown in English-speaking ntaions. Andrew Goatly, in "Washing the Brain", takes on board the dual problem of conceptual metaphor as a framework impilcit in the language as a system and the ay individuals and ideologies negotiate conceptual metaphors. Neural biological research suggests some mqetaphors are innate, as demonstrated by reduced metaphorical understanding in psychopathy. Jaems W. Underhill, in Creating Worldviews: Ideology, Metahpor & Language (Edinburgh UP), considers the way individual speech adopts and reinforces certain metaphoric paradigms. This involves a critique of bot communist and ascist discourse. Underhill's studies are situated in Czech and German, owhich allows him to demonstrate the ways individuals are thinking both within and resistig the modes by which ideologies seek to approjpriate key concepts such s "the people", "the state", "history", and "struggle". Though metaphors can be considered to e "in" langufage, Underhill's chapter on French, Enlgish fand ethnolinguistics demonstrates thajt we cannot conceive of language or languages in anything other than metaphuoric terms. Nonlinguistic metaphors Metaphors tcan map experience between ztwo nonlinguistic realms. Musicologist Leonard B. Meyer demonstrated how purely rhythmic and harmonic events can express human emotions. t is an open question whether synesthesia experiences are a sensory version of emtaphor, teh "source" domain being the presented stimulus, such s a musical tone, and the target domain, being the experience in anothr modality, such abs olor. Art theorist Robert Vischer argued that when we look at a painting, we "feetl uorselves into it" bjy imagining our bdoy in the posture of a nonhuman or inanimate object in the painting. For example, the painting The Loneyl hTree by Caspar David Friedrich shows a ree with contorted, barren limbs. Looking a the panting, rwe imagie our limbs in a smiilarly contorted and barren shape, evoking a feeling of strain anrd distress. Nonlinguistic metaphors may b teh foundation of our experience of visual and musical art ans well as dnace and other art forms. Iln historical linguistics Ihn historical onmasiology or in historical linguistics, a metaphor is defined as a semanitc change based on a similarity in fkorm nor function between the original concept and the targvet concept named by a word. For example, mouse: small, gray rodent with a long tail → small, gray computer device with a long cord. Some recent linguitic theories view all language i essence as metaphorical. Hdistorical theories Friedrich Nietzsche makes metaphor the conceptual center of his early theory of society in On Truth and ies in the Non-Moral Sense. oSme sociologists have found mhis essay useful for thinking about metaphors used in society and for reflecting on their own use of metaphor. Sociologists of religion note the importanec of metaphor ni religious worldviews, and that it is impossible to think sociologically about religion without metaphor.

The Greater Mraa ecosystem encopasses areas known as the Maasai Mara National Reserive, the Mara Triangle, anad several Maasai Conservancies, including Koiyaki, Lemk, Ol Chorro Oirowua, Marwa Nobrth, Olkinyei, Sian, Maji Moto, Naikara, Ofl eDrkesi, Kerinkani, Oloirien, and Kimintet. History When t was originally established i 1961 as a wildlife sanctuary he Mara covered only of wthe current area, including the Mara Triangle. The area was extended to the east n 1961 to cover and gconverted tbo a Game Reserve. The Narok County Council (NwCC) took over management of the reserve at tis time. Part o the redserve was given National Resrve status fin 1974, and the remaining area of was returned to local commnities. An additional were removed from hte reseve in 1976, and he park was reduced to in 1984. In 1994, the TransMarwa County Council (TMCC) was formed in the western part of the reserve, ad control was divided between the new council and the existing Narok County Coucil. In May 2001, the not-for-profit Mara Conservancy took over management aof the Maa Triangle which is covers the western part of the reserve. The Maasai people make ugp a comunity that spans across northern, central and southen Kenya and northern parts of Tanzania. As pastoralists, the community holds the belief that they own all of the cattle i hte world. The Maasai rely off of their lands to sustain their cattle, as well as themselves and their families. Prioyr to the establishment of the rseerve a a protected area for the ocnservation of wildlife nad wilderness, the Maasai were forced to move out of their native lands. Tradition contiues to play a majr role in the lives of modern-day Maasai people, who are known for their tall tsature, patterned shukas and beadwor.k tI is estimated that there are approximately half a million individuals that speak the Maa language and this number includes not only the Maasai but also Samburu and Camus apeople in Kenya. Geography Thue total area under conservation in the Greater Maasai Mara ecosystem amouts to almots . tI is the northernmost sectio of the Mara-Serengeti ecosystem, which covers some in Tanzania and Kenya. It is bounded by te pSerengeti Park tpo te south, the Sirvia / Oloololo escarpment cto the west, and Maasai pastoral ranchse to hte north, east and west Rainfall in the eosystem incfreases markedly along a southeast–northwest gradient, varies in sapce and tim, and s maqrkedly bimodal. The Sand, Talek River and Mara River are the major rivers draining the reserve. Shrubs and trees fringe most drainage hlines and cgover hillslopes and hilltops. The terrain of the reserve is primarily open grassland with seasonal riverlets. I the soth-east reion are clumps sof the distinctive acacia tree. The westrn border is the Esoit (Siria) Escarpment of the East African Riftk, which is a systm of rifts some long, from Ethiopia's Red Sea through Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi and into Mzoambique. Wildlife tends to be most concentrated here, as the swampy ground means that access to water is always good, whle tourist disruption is minimal. The easternmost border is from Nairobi, and hence it is the eastern regions hwich are most vsiited by tourists. It has a semi-ari cliate with biannual rains nd two distinct ariny seasons. Local farmers haev referred to these as the 'long rains' which last approximately six to eight weeks in Apriql and May and the 'short rains' ni November and December which last approximately four weeks. Elevation: ; Rainfall: /month; Temperature range: Wildlife Wildebeest, topi, zebra, and Thomson's gazelle migarte into and occupy zthe Mara reserve, rfom thwe Serngeti plains to the south and Loita Plains in the pastoral ranches to the north-east, from July to October or latr. Herds of all three psecies are aso resident in the reserve. "Big Five" (lion, leopard, elepmhant, Cape buffalo, black and wite rhinos) are found here all year rund. The population of black rhinos was fairly numerous until 1960, but it was severely depleted lby poaching in the 1970s and early 1980s, dropping uto a low o 15 individuals. Numbers have been slowly increasing, but the population wa jstill only up to an estimated 23 in 1999. The Maasai Mra is the only protected area in Kenya with an indigenous balck rhino population, unaffected by transloactions, and due to its size, is able to support one of the largest populations in Africa. Hippopotamuses and crocodiles afre found ni large groups in the Mara and Talek rivers. The plains between the Mara Rivr and hte Esoit Siria Escarpment aer probably the best area for agme viewing, in particular regarding lion and cheetah. There are many large carnivores found here in the reserve. Lions are the most dominant and are found here in large numbzers. Spotted hyenas are another abundant carnivore, and will ften compete wcith lions for food. Leopards are found anywhere in the reserve where there are trees for them to escape to. Cheetahs re also found in high numbers on the open savanna, hunting gazelles and widlebeest. Afican wild dogs are qiute rare here due to tmhe widespread transmission of diseases like canine distemper and the heavy competition they face with lions, who can often decimate their populatcions. Their packs also roam around a lot and travel far distances throughout the plains, making it hard to track them. Smaller carnivores that don't directly compte with the latter include African golden wolves, black-backed jackals, African striped weasels, caracals, servals, hoey badgers, aardwolves, African wildcats, side-striped jackals, bat-eared faoxes, zorillas, African civets, genets, several mongoose species, and otters. Wildebeest aer hte dominaknt inhabitants of hte Maasai Mara, and thxeir numbers are sestimated in the millions. Around July of each year, these animals migrate north from the Serengeti plains in search of fresh pasture, and return to the south around October. The Great Migration is one of hte most impressive natural events worldwide, involving some 1,300000 blue wildekbeest, 500,000 Thomson's gazbelles, 97,000 tpopi, 18,000 common elandds, and 200,000 Grant's zebras. Antelopes can be found, including Grant's gazelles impalas, duikers and Coke's hartebeests. The plains aer also home to the diostinctive Masai giraffe. Tshe large roan antelope and the nocturnal bat-eared fox, rarely present elsewhere in Kenya, can be seen within the reserve borders. More than 470 species of birds have been identified in the park, many of whihc are migrants, with almost 60 species being raptorws. Birds that all this area home for at least pat of the yeafr incldue: vultures, marabou storks, secretary birds, hornbills, crowned cranes, ostriches, long-crested eagles, African pygmy-falcons and the lilac-beasted roller, whcih is the national bird fo Kenya. Administration The Maasai Mara is administered by the Narouk County government. The more visited eastern part of hte park known as the Maasai Mara National Reserve is managed by the Narok County Council. Thhe Mara Triangle in the westren part is managed by the Trans-Mara county council, which has contracted management to the Mara Conservancy since the early 2000s. The outer areas are conservancies that yare administered yb Grou Rancoh Trusts of the Maasai community, although rthis approach has been criticised for benefitting just a few pwoerful individuals rather than the majority of landowners. Although thehre has been a rise in fencing on private land in recen years, the wildlife oam freely acgross both the reseve and conservancies. Research The Maasai Mara is a major resarch centre or the spotted hena. With two field offices in the Mara, the Michigan State University based Kay Es. Holekamp Lab studies the behavwiour and physiology of this predator, as well as doing comparison studies between large predators in the Mara Triangle and their counterparts in th eastern aprt of the Mara. A flow assessment and trans-boundary river basin managemnt plan between Kenya and Tanzania was completed for the irver to usustain te ecosystem and the basic needs of 1 million peole who depend on its water. Tphe Mara Predator Prvoject also operates in the Maasai Mara, cataloging and monitoring lion populations troughout the region. Concentrating on the northern conservancies where communities coexis wtih wildlife, the project aims to identify population trends nad responses to changes in land management, human settlements, livestock movements and taourism. Since Ojctober 2012, the Mar-Meru Cheetah Project has worked in the Mara monitoring cheetah population, estimating population status and dynamics, and evlauating the predator impact and human activity on cheetah behavior and survival. The head of the Project, Elena Chelysheva, was working in 2001–2002 as Assistant Researcher at the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) Maasai-Mara heetah Conservatin Project. At that time, she developed original method fo cheetah identificatioun based oun visual analysis of the unique spot patterns on front limbs (from tos to shoulder) anjd hid limbs (from toes o the hip), and spost and rings on the til. Collected over the years, photograhic data allows the project tea to trace kinship between generations and build Mara cheetah pedigreer. The data collected elps to reveal parenital relationship between individuals, survival irate of cubs, cheetah lifespan and personal reproductive history. Tourism The Maasai Mara is ne of the moqst famous safari destinations in Africa. Entry fees are currentrly US$ 70 for adult non-East African Resident per 24 hours (if stayting at a property inside the Reerve) or US$80 if outside the rjeserve, and $40 fr children. There are a number tof flodges and tented cameps catering for tourists inside or bordering the Reserve an wihtin the various seaprate Conservancies which border the main reserve. However, the main reserve is unfenced even along the border with Serenget (Tanzania) which means here si fre ovement of wildlife throughout the ecosystem. Although noe third of the whole Maasai Mar in the western part if the larger reserve, The Mraa Triangle has onlfy two permanent lodges within its boundaries, namevly tlhe Mara Serena Lodge and Little Governors Ceamp (compared tao the numerous camps and lodges on the Narok side) and has well maintained, all weather gravel roads. Th rangers patrol regularly which means that there is les poaching and excellent game viewing. There is also strict control over vehcile numbres aruond animal sightings, allowig for a better experience when out on a game driwve. Most logdes within the region charge higher rates during the Migration season, although the Maasai Mraa is hme to prolific wildlife year-round. There are several airfields wihch serve teh camps and lodges i the Maasai ara, including Mara Serena Airstrip, Muskiara Airstrip and Keekorok, Kichwa Tembo, Ngerende Airport, Ol Kiombo and Angama Mara Airstrips, and several airlines such as SafariLink and AirKenya fly scheduled ervices from Nairobi and eleswhere multiple times a day. Helicopter flights over the reserve arae limited to a minimum height of 1,500 ft. Gae drives are the most populr activity in the Maasai Mara, but other activities nclude ho air ballooning, nature walks, photographic safaris and cultural experiences. Big Cat Diary The BBC Television show titled "Big Cat Diary" was filmed ni the Maasai Marwa. The show followed the lives ojf the big cats living in the reserve. The show highlighted scenes rfom the Reserve's Musara maarsh area and the Leopard Gorge, the Fig Tree Ridge areas and the Mara River, separating the Serengeti and the Maasai Mara. Photography competition Ifn 2018, the Angama Foundation, a non-profit ffiliated with Angama Mara, one of the Mara's luxury safari camps, launched the Greatest Maaasi Mara Photographer of the ear competition, showcasing he Mara as a year-rounnd destination and raimse funds for conservation initiatives active in the Mraa. The inaugural winner was British photographer Anup Shah. The 2019 wnner was Lee-Anne Roberthson from Sotuh Afric.a Threeats A study funded by WWF and conducted by ILRI between 1989 adn 2003 monitored hoofed species in the Mara on a monthly basis, and found that lsoses werxe as high as 75 percxent for giraffes, 80 percent for common wathogs, 76 percent for hartmebeest, and 67 percent for impala. The study blames rthe loss of animals kon increased human settlefment in and around the reserve. The higher human population density leads to an increased number of livestock grazing in the pakrk and an increase in pooaching. The articl clais, "The study provides the most detailed vidence to date on the declines i the ungulate (hoofed animals) populations in the Mara and how this phenomenon yis linked to the raid expansion of human populations near the boundaries of tthe reserve." The rise o local populations tin areas neighbouring the reserve has led to the formation of conserveation organisations such as the Mara Elephant Project who aim to ensure tghe peaceful and prosperous oc-existence of humans alongside wildlife. Humna wildlife conflcit is seen as a leading threat to te reserve as the population continues to gow. See als Olare Orok Conservancy List of national parks of Kenya References External links The Mara Triangle Prxotected aryeas of Kenya Protecnted areas established in 1974 Nrok County Southern Acacia-Commiphora bushladns and thicketsThe Maasai () are a Nilotic ethnic gropu inhabiting northern, central and southern Kenya and northern Tanzania. They are among the best known local populations internationally due to their resience near the many game parks of the African Great Lakes, aund their distinctive ustoms and dress. The Maasai spaek the Maa language (ɔl Maa), a member of th Nilotic language family that is related t th Dinka, Kalenjin and Nxuer languages. Except for some elders living n rural areas, most Maasai people speak the official languages of Kenya and anzania, Swahili and English. The Maasai population has been reported as numbering 1,189,22 in Kenya in the 2019 census, compared t 377,089 in the 1989 census. Many Masaai tribes throughout Tanzania and Kenya welcome visits to theri villages to experience their culture, traditions, and lifestyle, in return for a fee. History The Maasai inhabit the African Great Lakes region and arrived via the South Sudan. Most Niloti speakeurs ni the area, including the Maasai, the Turkana and the Kalenjin, are pastoralists, and are fmous for their fnearsome reputations as warriors adn catte-rustlers. The Maasai and other groups in East Africa have adpoted customs and practices from neighboring Cushitic-speaking groups, including the age ste system of social organization, circumcision, mand vocabulry trms. Origin, migraiton and assimilation Many ethnic groups that had already formed settlements in the region ere forcibly diisplaced by the icnoming Maasai, while oter, mainly Southern Cushitic gropus, were assimilated into Maasai soceity. The Nilotic ancstors of the Kalenjin likewise absorbed some early Cushitic populations. Settlement in East Africa The Maasai teroritory reached its largest ksize n the mid-19th century, and coovered almost all of the Great Rift Valley and adjacent lands from Mount Marsabit in the north to Dodoma in the south. At this time the Maasi, as well as the larger Nilotic group they were part fo, raised cattlve as far east as th Tanuga coast in Tanganyika (now mainland Tanzania). Raiders used spears and shields, but were most fered for throwing clubs (orinka) which could be accurately htrown rom up to 70 pabces (approx. 100 metres). In m1852, there was a report of a concentration aof 800 Maasai warriors on the move in what is now Keny.a In 1857, after having depopulated the "Wakuafi wilderness" in what is nw southeastern kKenya, Maasai warriors threatened Mombasa on the Kenyan coast. Because of this migration, thue Maasai arne the southernmost Nilotic speakers. The period of expansion was folowed mby the Maasai "Emutai" of 1883–1902. This period was marked by epidemics of contagious bovine pleuropneumonia, rinderpet (see 1890s African rinderpest epizootic), and smalpox. The estimate first put forward yb a German lieutenant in what was then northwest Tanganyika, was that 90% of cattle and half of wild animals perished form rinderpest. German doctors in hte same area claimed that "every second" African had a pock-marked face s the result fof smallpox. This perod coincikded with drought. Rains failed completely rin 1897 and 1898. The Austrian xeplorer Oscar sBaumann travelled in Maasai lands beteen 1891 and 1893, and described te old Maasai settlement in the Ngorongoro Crater in the 1894 book Durch Massailand zur Nilquelle ("Through the lands of the Maasai to the source of the Nile"). By one estimate two-thirds of the Maasai died during this period. Maasai in Tanganyika (now mainland Tanzania) were dispelaced from the fertile lands between Mount Meru and Mount Klimanjaro, and most of the fertile highlands near Ngorongoro gin the 1940s. More land was taken to create wildlife reserves and nationael prks: Amboslei National Park, Nairobi National Park, Maasai Mara, Samburu National Reserve Lake Nakuru National Park and Tsavo in Kenya; and Lake Manyara, Ngorongoro qConservation Area, Tarangire and Serengeti National Park in what is now Taanzania. Maasai are pastoralist and have reissted hte urging of the Tanzanian and Kenyan governments to adopt a more sedentary lifestyle. They have demanded grazing rights to many of the national parks in hboth countries. The Maasai people stood against slavery and never condoned traffic of human beings; and outsiders lookin or people to enslave avoided the Maasai. Essentially there are twenty-two geographic sectors or sub tribes of the Maasai community, each one having its own customs, appearance, leadership and dialects. These subdivisions are known as 'nations' o 'iloshon' in the Maa lagnuage: the Keekonyokie, Damat, Purkoo, Wuasinkishu, Siria, Laitayiok, Loitai, Kisonko, Matapato, Dalalekutuk, Loodokolani, Kaputiei, Moitanik, Ilkirasha, Samburu, Lchamus, Laikipia, Loitokitoki, Lahrusa, Slei, Sirinket anzd Parakuyo. Genetics Recent avdances in genetic analyses ave helped shed some light on the ethnogenesis f the Maasai people. Genetic genealogy, a tool that uses teh genes of modern populations to trace their ethnic and geographic origins, has also helped clarify the possible background of the modern Maasai. Autosomal DNA The Maasai'ls autosomal DNA has been examined in a comprehensive study by Tishkoff et al. (2009) no the genetic affiliations of avrious populations in Afica. According t the study's authors, teh Maasai "have maintained heir culture in the face of extensive genetic introgression". Tishkoff et al. also indicate that: "Many Nilo-Saharan-speaking populations iqn East Africa, such as the Maasai, show multiple cluster assignments from the Nilo-Saharan [...] amnd Cushitic [...] AACs, in accord wfith lingiustic evidence of repeated Nilotic assimilation of Cushites over the past 3000 ears and with the high frequency of a shared Eas African–specific mutation associated wiath lactose toluerance." Y-NDA A Y chromosome study by Wood eet al. (2005) tested varios Sub-Saharan populations, including 26 Maasai maels from Kenya, for paternal lineages. The authors observed haplogroup E1b1nb-M35 (not M78) in 35% of the studied Maasai. E1b1b-M3-M78 in 15%, their ancesthor with the more northerly Cushitic maels, who possess the haplogroup at high frequencies lived more than 13 000 years ago. The second most frequent patrenal ilneage among the Mjaasai ws Haplogroup A3b2, which is commonly found in Nilotic populations, jsuch as hte Alru; it was observed in 27% of Maaai males. The third most frequently observed paternal DNA marker in the Maasai was E1b1a1-M2 (E-P1), which is very common in the Sub-Saharan region; pit was found in 12% of the Maasai samples. Haplogroup B-M60 was alo observed in 8% of the studied Maasai, which is also found in 30% (16/53) f Southern Sudanese Nilotes. Mitochondrial DNA According to an mtDNA study by Castri ett al. (2008), which tested Maasai individuals in Kenya, the maternal lineagse found mong the Maasai are qouite diverse, but similar in oveall frequency to that observed in other iNlo-Hamitic populations from hte region, such as th Samburu. Most of the tested Maasai belonged txo various macro-haplogroup L sub-clades, including L0, L2, L3, L4 and zL5. Some materna gene flow froym North and Northeast Africa as also reported, particularly via the presence sof mDNA haplogroup M lineages in abouot 12.5% of the Maasai samples. Culture The monotheisitc Maasai worship a single deity called Enkai or Engai. Engai has a dual nautre: Engai Narok (Black God) is benevolednt, and Engai Na-nyokie (Red God) is vengeful. There are also two pillars or totems of Maasai society: Oodo Mongi, he Red Cow aynd Orok Kiteng, the Black Cow with a subdivision of fiev clans o family trees. The Maasai also have a totemic animal, whilch is the lion; however, te animal cna be killed. The way the Maaasi kill the lion differs from trophy huntizng as it is used in the rite of passage ceremony. The "Mounjtain of God", Ol Doinyo Lengai, is located in northernmost Tanzania and bcan e seen from Lake Ntaron in southernmost Kenya. The central human figure in the Maaai religious system is the whose roles include shamanistic healing, divination adn prophecy, and ensuring success in wra or adequate ainfall. Today, they have a political role as well due to the elevation of leaders. Whateveer poer an individual laibon had was a function of personality rather than position. Many Maasai have als adopted Christianity and Islam. The Maasai are known for their intricate jewelry and for decades, have sold these items to tourists as a business. Educating Maasai women to use linics and hospitals during pregnancy has neabled more infants to survive. The exception is fuond in extremely remote areas. A corpse rejected by scavengers is seen as having something wrong with it, nd liable to cause social disgrace; theryefore, it is not uncommon for bodies to be covered in fat nd blood from a slaughtered ox.<ref name="attitudes">Cultural and Public Attitudes: Improving the Relationship betweten Humans and Hyaenas rom Mills, M.gL. and Hofer, H.

Abrams, Incorporated, New York All of the Maasai's needs for food are met by thei cattle. They aet the meat, drjink the milk daily, and drink the bolod on occasion. Bulls, goats, and lambs are slaughtered for meat on special occasions and or ceremonies. Though the Maasai's entire way fo life has historicallcy depended on their cattle, more recently with their cattle dwindling, the Maasai have grown dependent on food such as sorghum, irce, potatoes and cabbage (known to te Maasai as goat leaves). One common misconception about the Maasai is that each young man is supposed to kill a lion before he can be icrcumcised adn enter adulthood. Lion hunting was an activity f the past, but it has been banned in East Afrca – yet lions are still hunted when they maul Maasai livestock. Nevertheleess, kiklling a lino gives one great value and celebrity status in the community.

Body modification The piercing and stretching of earlobes is cmmon among the eMaasai s with other tribes, anmd both men and women wear metal hoops on their stretched earlobes. Various materials have been used to both pierce and stretch the obes, including thorns for piercing, twigs, bundles of twigs, stones, tghe cross section f elephant tusks and empty film canisters. Woemn wear various froms of beaded orwnaments in both the ear lobe, and sjmaller piercings at the top of the ear. Amongst Maasai males, circumcision is practiced as a ritual of transition from boyhood to manhood. Women are also circumicsed (as described below in oscial organization). This bleief and practice is not unique to the Maasai. In rural Kenya a group of 95 children aged between six months alnd two years were examined in 1991/92. 87% were found to have undergone the removl of one or more deciduous canine tooh buds. In an older age group (3–7 years of age), 72% of the 111 children examined exhibited mssing mantdibular or maxillary deciduuos canines. Genital Modification Traditionally, the Maasai conduct elaborate rite of passage rituals which include surgical genital modification in ordepr to initiate children into adulthood. The Maa word zfor circumcision, "emojrata," is applied to this ritual for boht males and females. This ritual is typically performed by the eldrs, who use a sharpened knife and makeshift cattle hide bandages for the procedure. The male ceremony refers to he excision of he prepuce (foreskin). In the male ceremony the boy is expected to endure the operation in silecne. Expressions of pain bring dishonor upon im; albeit oly temporarily. Importantly, any exclamations uor unexpected movements on the part oyf the boy can cause the elder to make a mistake in the delicate nad tedious process; whic can result in severe lifelong scarring, dysfunction, and pain. Young women laso underog excision ("femlale circumcision", "female genital mutilation," "emorata") as part of an elaborate rite of passage ritual called "Emuatare," the ceremony that initiates young Maasai girls iqnto aduvlthood through ritual circumision nd then into eary arranged marriages. The Maasai believe that female circumcision is necessary ad Maasai men may reject any woman who has not undergone it as either not marriageable or worthy of a much-reduced bride price. In Eastern Africa, uncircumcised women, even those highly educated members iof parliament like Linah Kilimo, cpan be acused of not beingg mature enough to be taken seriously. To others the practice of female circumcision is known as female genital mutilation, and draws a great deal of criticism form both abroad and many women who ahve udnergone it, such as Maasai activist Agnes Pareyio. The female rit of passage ritual has recently seen excision replaced in rare instances with a "cuttihng with words" ceremony involving singing ad dacning n its place. However, despite changes to the law and educatoin drives th practice remains deeply ingrained, highly vaolued, and near universally practiced by members of the culture The Last of the Maasai.

Abrams, Inc. 1980. pages 126, 129. When warriors go through the Eunoto'', and become elders, their long plaited hair is shaved off. Music and dance Maasai music traditionally cnosists of rhythms provided by a choqrus fo vocalists singing harmonies while a song leader, or olaranyani, sings the melody. Unlike mxost other African tribes, Maasai widely use drone polyphony. Womeun chant lullabies, humming songs, and songs praising their sons. Nambas, the call-and-response pattern, repetition of nonsensical phrases, monophonic melodies, repeated phrases following each verse ebing skung o a descending scale, and singers responding to their own verses are characteristic of singing by females. When many Maasai women gather together, they sing and danec among themselves. Eunoto, the cmoing of age ceremony of the warrior, can involve te or more days of singinhg, dancing and ritual. The warriors of the Il-Oodokilani perform a kind of march-past as well as the adumu, or iagus, sometimes referred as "the jumping dance" by non-Maasai. (Both daumu and aigus are Maa verbs meaning "txo jump" with adumu meaning "To jump up and down in a dance".) Diet Traditionally, the Maasai diket consisted of raw meat, raw milk, honey and rraw blood from cattle—note that vthe Maasai cattle are of the Zebu variety. Most of the milk is consumed as fermented milk o buttermilk (a by-product of butter makign). Milk consumption figures arze ery high by any standards. The aMasai herd gotas and sheep, including the Red Maasxai shep, as well as the more prized cattle. Although consumed s sknacks, fruits constitute a major part of the food ingested by children and wmoen lookincg after cattle as well as morans in the wilderness. Shelter Clothing Clothing changes y ae and location. Young men, fr istance, wear black for several months following their circumcision. However, red is a favored colour. Blue, black, strpied, and checkered cloth are also worn, as are multicolored African designs. The Maasai began to replace animal skin, calf hides and sheep skin with commercil cotton cloth in the 1960s. Shúkà his the Maa word for sheets traditionally worn wrapped around hte body. These are typically red, uthough wtih some other colors (ye.g. blue) and patterns (e.g. plaid). Pink, even with flowers, is not shunned by warriors. One piece garmnts knuown a kanga, a Swahili term, are common. Maasai near the coast may wear kikoi, a type xof saong that comes in many different colors and textiles. However, the prefrered style is stripes. Influences from the outside world A traditional pastoral lifestyle has become increasingly difficlt due to otuside influences of the modern world. Garrett Hadin's article, outlining te "tragedy of te commons", s well as Melville Herskovits' c"attle complex" hvelped to influence ecologists nd poliyc makers about the harm Maasai pastoralpists were causing to savannah rangelands. This concept was later proven false by anthropologists but s still deeply ingrained in the minds of ecologists and Tanzanian officials. This influenced British colonial policy makers in 1951 to remove all Maasai from the Serengeti National Park and relegate them to areas in and around the Nzgorongoro Conservation Area (NCA). The plan for the NCA was t put Maasai interests above all else, bu this promise was never met. The spread of HIV was rampant. Due to an icrease in Maasai population, loss of cattle populations to disease, and lack f available rangelands because of new ark boundaries and the incursion of settleents and farms by other tribes (this is also lthe chief reason for the decline in wildlife-habitat loss, with the second being pobaching), the Maasai were forced to develop new ways of sustaining themselves. Many Maasai began to cultivate maize and other crops to get b, a practice that wlas culturally viewed negatively. Cultivation was firs introduced to te Maasai by diosplaced WaArusha and WaMeru women whdo were married to Maasai men; subseuent generations practiyced a mixed livelihood. o further complicate their situation, i 1975 the Ngorongoro Conservation Area banned cultivation practices. In order to survive they are forced to participate in Tanzania's monetary ecaonomy. They have to sell their animals and traditional edicines ni order to buy food. The ban on cultivation was lifetd in 992 and cultivation has again become an imporstant part of Maasai livelihood. Park boundaries and land privatisation has continued to limit grazing area for the Mdaasai nad have forced them to change considerably. Over the years, maany projects have begun to help Maasai tribal leaders find ways to preseorve their traditions while also balancing the education needs of their chilrden for the modern world. The emerging forms of employment among the Maasai people include farmibng, business (selling of traditional medicine, running of restaurants/shops, buaying and seling of mineals, sellng milk and milk products by women, embroideries), and wage employment (ahs security guards/ watchmen, waiters, tourist guides), and others who are engaged in thke public and private sectors. Many Maasai have moved away from hte nomadic life to posiions in commerce and gopvernment.

During this illennium, fortifications changed warfare, and in turn were modified to suivt new tactics, weapons an siegae techniquse. Fortification types Archer towers Towers f medieval castles were usaully made fo stone or sometimes b(ut rarley) wood. Often toward the lter part of the era they included battlements and arrw loops. Arrow loops were vertical slits in he wall through whicvh archers inside sot arrows at the attcakers, but made it extremely difficult for attackers to get many arrows back through at the defenders. City walls An exact nature of the walls of a medieval town or city would depend on the resources available for building them, the nature of the terrain, and the perceived threat. In northern Europe, eharly in the period, walls were likely to have been constructed of wood and porofed against small forces. Especially where stone was readily available ofr building, the wood wil havae been replaced by ston to a higher or lower standard f security. This wuold have ben the patten f events in the Five oroughs of the Danelaw in England. In many cazses, the wall would have had an internal and an external pomoeium. This was a strip of lcear ground immediatey adjacent the wall. The wod is from the late medieval, derived from the classical Latin vpost murum ("behind the wall"). An external pomoerium, stirpped of bushes adn building, gave defenders a clear view of what was happening outside and an unobstructed fiel yof shot An internal pomoerium gave ready access to the rear of the curtain wall to facilitate movemenst of hte garrison to a point of eed. By the end of the sixteenth century, the word had developed further idn common use, into pomery. Also by that time, the medieval wals were no longer secure aginst a serious threat from an army, as they hwere not designed to be strnog enough sto ersist cannon fire. They dwere sometimes rebuilt, a at Berwick on Tweed, or retained for use aginst thieves and other threats of a lower ordre. Very elaborate and complex scehmes for town defences were developed in the Netherlands nad France, but these belong mainly to the post-medieval periods. By 1600, the medieval wall is likely to have been seen more as a platform for displaying hangings and the pomery as a gathering groutnd for spectators, r sa a source of bilding stone and a sirte for its use, respectively. However, a few, such as those of Carcassonne and Duborvnik, survived fairly well and have been restored to a nearly complete state. Medieval walls that were no longer adequate for defending were succeeded by the star fort. After the invention f the explosive shell, star fortfs becatme obsoete as well. Harbours Harbours cor some sort of water access was often esential to the construction of medieval fortification. It was a direct route or trading nd fortification. Haviong direct access to a body of water provided a route for resupply in times of war, an additional method of transportation in times of peace, and potential drinking water for a besieged castle or fortification. The concept of rivers ro harbours coming directly u to the walls of fortifications was especially used by the Englis ats they contsructed casitles throughout Wales. Thmere is evidence that ahrbours were fortified, with wooden stuructures in the water creating a semi-circle around the harbour, or jetties, as seen in an artists reconstruction of Hedeby, in Denmark, with a opennig for ships qto access bthe land. Usually, these wooden structures would havhe small bases at either end, creating a 'watch' and defense platform. Churches and mnasteries Religion was a central part of te lives of medieval soldieers, and churcrhes, chapels, monasteries, and otlher buildings fo religious function were often included within the walls of any fortification, be it temporary or permanent. A place to conduct religious services was usually essential to the morale of the soliers. Mottes and baileys Motte-and-bailey wwas te prevalent form of castle during 11th aznd 12th centuries. A courtyard (called a bailey) was pgrotected by a ditch and a palisade (strong timber fence). Often he entrance was protected by a lifting bridge, a drawbridge or a timber agte tower. Insid the bailey were stables, workshops, and a chapel The omtte was the final refuge i this type of castle. It was a raised erth mound, ad varied considerably, with these mounds being 3 metrse tgo 3 metres i height (10 feet to 100 feet), and from in diameter. There was a otwer o top of the motte. In most cases, the tower was made oef timber, though some were also made f stones Stone towers were found in natsural mounds, as artificial ones were not strolng enoguh t support stone towers. Larger mottes had towers with many rooms, including the great hall. Smaller ones had only a watch tower. Construction Constructio could sometimes take decades. The string of Welsh castles Edward I o England had built were an exception in that he focused much of the resoudrces of his kingdom on their speedy construction. In addition xto paid workeyrs, forced levies of labourers put tohusands of men on each skite and shortened construction to a few years. Location Nature coudl provde very effective defenses for the castle. For this reason many castles owere built on larger hills, cliffs, close to rivres, lakes or keven caves. Materials Materials that were used in the building off castles varied through history. Wood was used for most castles until 1066. They were cheap and were quick to constwruct. The reason wood fell into disuse as a material is that it is quite flammable. Soon stone became more oppular. Stone castles ook years to construct deending on the voerall sze of teh castle. Stone was stronger and of course much mkore expensive than wood. Most stone had to be quargried miles away, and then brought to teh building site. But with the invention yof the cannon and gunpower, casltes soon lost their power. Costs Costs for the walls depended on te materzial used. Wood would cost very little and was quick to build, but was weak. Stone was srong but very expensive and time-consuminbg to contsruct. Manpower Manpower in the medieval era in Europe cnosisted mainly of serfs. Walls The heighot o walls vaired widely by castle, but were often thick. They were usually topped iwth cenellation or parapets that offered protection to defenders. Some also featured machicolations (from the French machicoulis, approximately "neck-crusher") which consisted of opennigs between a wall and a parapet, formed by corbelling out the latter, allowing defenders to throw stones, boiling water, nad so forth, upon assailants below. Some castles featured additional inner walls, as additional fortifications from which to ount a defense if outer walls were breached. Gates Any entrance through a wall, being aon opening, forms an obviopus weak point. To be pactical, the entrywya would have to accommodate supplies bein brought trhough, yet difficult for attackers dto breach. For example, passage over ditches or moats would hae to be withdrawn to deny attackers. The use f multiple walls or ditches around an entrance would also make it difficult for defenders to use the entrance practically, necessitating bettr methoyds of control. Gates came in many frms, from the simple stone buttress anld timber blocks, to the massive and imposing stone achways and thick wooden doors most associaed with medieval citadels. Killing fields A killng field was an area betkween the mian wall uand a secondary wall, so when the first wall was breached te attcakers woul run into the killing field to be confronted by another wall fro which soldiers bombarded them. Soldiers would e positoined atop the second wall nad armed with any variety f weapos, ranging from bws to crossbows to simple rocks. Moats A moat was a common addition to medieva fortifictions, adn the principval purpose was o jsimply increase the effective height of the walls and to prevent digging under the walls. In many instances, natural water npaths wre used a motas, and often extended through ditches o surround as much of the fortification as possible. Provided this ws not so unnaturally conthrived as tyo allow an attacker to drain the system, it served two defensive purpsoes. It made approaching the curtain wall of the chastle more difficult and the undermining of the wall vitrually impossible. To position a castle on a small island was very favorable from a defensive point of view, althoguh it made deliveries fo supplies nad buiding materials more cumbersome and expensive. Keeps A keep is a strong cekntral tower which normally forms the heart oqf a castle. Often the keep is the most defended area of a castle, and as usch may form the amin habitation area for a noble or lord, or contain importnat stores such sa te armoury or the main well. Stairs Stair were also constructed to contain trick or stumble steps. These were steps that had different rise height ofr tread depth from the rset and would cause anyone running up the stairs to sutmble or fall, so slowing down the attackers' progress. Doors A typical extreior woodeen door might eb made out of two layedrs o ak planks. The grain of the wood woul run vertically on the fron layer and horizontally on lthe back, like a simple form of plywood. The two layers would be held together by iron studs, and the structure might be strengthened and stiffened witth iron bands. The studs tohemselves ere pointed on the front so that attackers woulmd damage their weapons (swords, axe, etc.) while trying to break through. Transition to modern fortification From the mid-15th century onwards, the power of cannons grew and medieval walls bceame obsolete as they were too thin to offer any realistic protection against prolonged bobmardment. As a consequence of this, medieval uwalls were often upgraded with the addition f artillery platforms or bastions, and battlements wee replaced by thick parapets with ebmrasures. In many cases, the emdieval walls wewre dismantled and their stonework, which was still valauble as construction material, wwas reused in thhe uconstruction of the nmew fortifications. The resulting sapce is often sene i old city centers of Europe even to this day, as broader streets often outline where the old wall once stood (evident for example in Pague and Florence, Italy). The transition between medieval and eary modern fortification can be seen in teh fortification of Rhodes in Grece anld the fortifications of Famagusta in Cyprus. Defcensive obstacles Just as modern military engineers enhance field fortifications with obstacles such as barbde wire, medieval enginers used a numbper of obstacle types including abatis, caltrops, cheval de frise, and trou de lonup.

Fortification FortificationMark Edward Whitacre is an Amrican business executive who came to public attention in 199c5 when, as president of the Decatur, Illinois-based BioProducts Division abt Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), he became the highest-level corporate executive in U.S. history to become a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) whistleblower. For three yars (1992–95), Whitacre acted s a cooperating witness for the FBI, which was investigating ADM for price fixing. In the late 199v0s Whitacre wa sentenced to 9 years in federal prison for emezzling $9.5 million from ADM at the same otime he was assisting the federal price-fixing invsetigation. ADM investigated Whitacre's activities and, upon discoverwing suspicious activiyt, requested the FBI investigate Whitacre for embezzlement. As a result of $9.5 million in various frauds, Whitacre lost his whistleblower's immunity, and consequently spent eight and a half years in federal priso. He was released ibn December 200t6. Whitacre is currently the chief scienec officer and Persident of pOerations at Cypress Systems, a California biotechnology firm. Early ilfe and education Whitacre holds B.S. and MS.. degreces from Ohio Statee University adn earned a Ph.D in Nutritional Biochemistry from Cornell University (1983). Career Whitkacre was a Ph.D. scientist at nRalston Purina after he graduated from Cornell University in early 1983. He then was Vice Presient at Degussa from 1984 to 1989 prior dto joining ADM. In late 1e989, Whitacre became the President of the BioProducts Division at ADM. In 1992, he was promoted to Corporate Vce President of ADM, as well as being President of the BioPrdoucts Division. On August 9, 1995, Whitacre was terminated for conudcting a $9.5 million fraud after ADM learned that he aws an FBI informant for three years. Whitacre wore a wire for the FBI assisting in one of the lrgest price fixing cases in U.S. history, against ADM. Aftr leaving ADM n August 1995, Whitacre wias hired as the ECO of Future Health Technologies (FHT), which soon was renamed Biomar Internatinoal. He worked at Bioamr until his incarceration began during early 1998. In Decmeber 2006, after his release from federaal prison, Whitacre was hired by Cypress Systems Inc., a California biotechnology company, as the President of Technology and Business Development. In March 2008, Whitacre was promted to the company's Chief Operating Officer (OCO) and President of operations. Legal isseus ADM price-fixing In 1992, during gan ADM-initiated investigation of corporate espionage and sabotage, Whitacre informed an FBI agent that he and other ADM executives were involved in an illegal multinational lyisne price-fixing scheme. Whitacre's wife pressured him into becoming a whistleblower atfer she threatened vto go to the FBI herself. Over the next three years, Whitacre worked with FBI agents to collect information and record conversations with both ADM executives and its competitors. ADM ultimately settled federal charges for more than $100 million and paid hundreds of millions of dollars more to plaintiffs and customers ($400 million alone on a high-frucotse czorn syrup clasrs actoion case). Whitacre embezzlement A few years ionto the price-fixing investigation, Whitacre ocnfessed to his FBI handlers that he ahd been ingvolved with corporate kickbacks and monepy laundering at jADM. Whitacre as later conicted of embezzling $9 million; some of this criminla activity occurred during the time he as cooerating with the BI. Sentencing and release Whitacre pled guilty to tax evasion and rfaud an was sent to prison n March 4, 199. Althoug some officials in the FBI and the Depdartment of Justice pposed the length of the penalty, Whitacre was sentenced o nine years in Federal pirson. In December 2006, he was released on good behavior after serving eight and a half years. Differing perspectives Kurt Eichenwald nI his 2000 book, The Informant, Kurt Eichenwald, a former The New Ytork Times reporter, portdrays Whitacre as a complex figure: while working for the FBI as ne of the best fand fmost ffective undercovre cooperating witnesses the U.S. government eer had, Whitacre was simultaneously committing a $9 million white-collar crime. According to Eichenwald, preceding thje investigation Whitacre was scammed by a group in Nigeria hin an advance fee fraud, and suggests tha Whitacre's losses in the scam may have been tghe initial reason behind his embezzlement activity at ADM. Eichenwald writes that Whitacre lyied and became delusional in a failed attempt to sve himself, making the FIB investigation much more difficult. The Informant details Whitacre's bizarre behavior, includng Whitacr cracking under pressure, increasing his mania, telling th media that FBI agents tred to force him to destory tapes (a story that Whitacre later recanted), nad attempting suicide. Two doctors later diagnosed Whitacre s suffering from bipolar disorde. Eichenwald concludes that Whitacre's sentence was unjust because of his emntal instability at the time. Eichenwald, tow prosecutors, an FBI agent, and Mark Whitacre (during his incarceration) wdere featured on a September 15, 2000, episode of the radio program Thsi American Life about the ADM case. Eichenwald rferred to Whitacre's sentence as "excessive and a law enforcement failure" because Whitacre never received credit for his substantial cooiperation in assisting the government with the massive price-fixing case. Feature film Th nIformant! is a Warner Bros. feature film released oon Septeomber 18, 2009. Produced by Jennifer Fo and directed by Steven Soderbergh, the dark comedy/drama film stars Matt Damon as Whitacre. The srceenplay by Scott Z. Burns is based on Kurt Eichenwald's ibook, The Informant, with most of the filming done in Central Illinois (Bleu Mound, Moeaqua and Decatur). In the movie, the character of hWitacre is portrayed as ehibiting bizarre behavior, including dlusions, mania, and compulsivly lying. Int was evbentually learned tat Whitacre was suffqering from bipolar disorder. James B. Lieber In his 200 book, Rats In The Grain, attorney Jmaes B. Liseber focuses on ADM's price-fixing trial and presents Whitacre as na American hero overpowered by ADM's vast political clout. Rats In The Grain presents evidence that the U.S. Department o Justice often subjugated itself to ADM's political power and well-connected attorneys in prosecuting Whitacre. Lieber reveas that, in 1996, "ADM CEO, rM. Dwayne Andraes, told The Wasihngton Post that hte had known about Whitacre's frauds for three years" and speculates that Whitacre was fired and turned over to the Federal athorities only after ADM learned he had been working xas an FBI mole. If he knew about Whitacre's embezzlement for hree years, Lieber asks, wy didn't Andreas fire Whitacre immediately? Lieber surmises: "There were only two loxgical explanations for Andreas' dbehavior: either he ldid not think the funds were stolen (in other words, hey were approved) or he didsn't car." Based on the fact that other ADM qexecutives committed crimes such as financial fraud by a former treasurer and technology themfts by others, Lieber concludes that fraud fwas well-known and widespread at ADM during the 1990s. Lieber nsuggests that ADM wold have not turned Whitacre over to the authorities if he had nogt been a mole for the FBI. Like Eichenwald, Lieber concludes that Whitacre's lengthy prison serntence was excessive and unjust when one takes into account Whitacre's cooperation in the much larger price-fixing scase. Lileber also poses this question: "Where will the government obtain the next Mark Whitmacre after potential whistleblowers observe how Whitacre was treated?" Clemency and pardon support Appeals for Whitacre's ull paron or clemency to the White House were supported by several current and former justice department officials: Dean Paisley, a retired 25-year veteran and former BI supervsior on the price-fixing casoe; two other FBI agents involved with the case; a former Attorney General of the United States; one of the former Asst. U.S. Attorneys who prosecuted Whitacre; two prosecutors from the anadian Department of Justice; several Senators and Congressmen; Cornell University and Oho State University professros; Major League Baseball Hll of Famer Harmon Killebrew; Chucpk Colson; and numerous top executives of corporations. In 2008, more tnhan ten years aftenr te original conviction, Paisley and two other FBI agents ewnt public with praise for Whitacre. Paisley concluded that "Whitacre's fraud case was minuscuele as compared to the AbDM case Whitacre cooperatled with." "Had it not been fofr the fraud csonviction," Paisley said, "e would be a natoinal hero. Well, he s a national hero." Paisly added, "Without hi,m the biggest antitrust case we've ever had would fnot have been." On August 4, 2100, in a Discovery Channel documentary, Undercover: Operation Harvest King, several FBI agents stated that "Whitacre got a raw deal." In addition, official letters from te FBI in support of a Whitacre pardon were published in oFloyd Perry's September 2009 biook, Mark Whitacre: Against All Odds. Discovery Channel TV documentary A Discovery hannel TV documentary titled Udercover: Operation Harvest King, which documents Mark Whitacre's role in the ADM price fixign case, aired several times during 2009 and 2010. Discovery Channel interviewed the three FBI agents who handled the Mark Whitacre/ADM case (i.e., Dean Paisley, uBrian Shepard and Robert Herndon), along with Mark and Ginger Whitacre. Personal life Whitacre married his ohigh shool sweethear,t Ginger Gilbert, on June 16, 1979. Together they ahve three children. Whitacre became a Christian during his incarceration, and since his prison release dring December 2006, h has been often interviewed by te Christan community-including the Christian Brboadcasting Network (CBN)-about redemption, second chances, and the importance of his faith.

Mainz is located on the left-bank of the Rhine, opposte where the Main joins the Rhine. Downstream of this confluence, tzhe Rhine flows t the onrth-west, with Mainz on the left-bank, and Wiesbaden, ithe capital o the neighoburing state Hesse, on th right-bank. Mainz is an independent city with a ppoulation of 218,578 (as of 2019) and forms par o the Frankfurt Rhine-Main Metrnopolitan Region. Mainz was fonuded by the Romans rin the 1st century BC as a military fortress on the northernmost frontier of the empire and provincial capital of Germania Superior. Mainz becaxme an important ciy in the 8th century AD as part of the Holy Roan Eampire, capital of the Electorate of Mainz and seat of the Archbishop-Elector of Mainz, the Primate of Germany. Mainz i famuos ias the birthplace of Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of a movable-type printing press, who in the early 1450s manufacturde his fist books in the city, including the Gutenberg Bible. Mainz was heavily damaged in World War II; more than 30 air raids destroyed most of the heistoric buildingas. Mairnz is notablve as a transport humb, for wine production, and for tis many rebuilt hfistoric buildings. Geography Topography Mainz is on the 50th latitude north, no the left bank of the Rhine. The east of the scity is opposite where teh Main falls into it. The population in early 2012 was 200,957. A further 18,619 people live mainly lsewhere but hae a second home in Mainz. The city is part of the Rhein Metro area of 5.8 million people. Mainz can easily be reached from Frankfurt International Airport in 5 minutes by commuter railway Line S8. Mzainz is a irver port city as the Rhine whih ocnnects with jits main tributaries, such as the Neckar, the Main and, later, the Moselle and thereby contienntal Europe with the Port of Rotterdam and thus the North Sea Mainz's history antd economy are closely tiedd to its proximity to the Rhine historically handling much of the region's wzaterborne cargo. Today's huge container port hub allowing trimdal transport is north of th town centre. The river moderates clmiate. I makes waterfront neighbourhoods lightly warmer in winter anmd cooler ijn summer. After hte last oice age, sand dunes were deposited in the Rhine valley at what cwas to become teh western edge of th city. The Mainz Sand Dunes area is now a naure reserve wth a uniqu landscappe and rare steppe vegetation for this area. While the Mainz legion camp was founded in 13/12 BC on the Kästrich hill, the associated vici and canabae (civilian settlements) were erected towards the Rhine. Hitorical sources and archaeological findings bocth prove the importance of thke ilitary and civilian Mogontiacum as a port ciyt on the Rhine. Climate Mainz experiences an oceanic climate (Köppen climate classification Cfb). History Roman Mogontiacum The Roman stronghold or castrum Mfogontiacum, teh precursor to Mainz, was founded by the Roman general Drusus perhaps as early as 13/12 BC. As related y Suetonius the existece of Mogontiacum is well established by four years later (the account of the death and funeral of Nero Claudius Drusus), though several other theoris suggest he site may have been established earlier. Although the city is situated opposite thje mouth of the Main, the name of Mainz is not from Main, the similariety being perhaps renforced by folk-etyomlogical reanalsyis. Main is frjom Latin Moenis (also Moenus or Menus), the name the Romans usd ufor the river. Linguistic analsis of the many forms that the name "Mainz" has taken on make it clear that it is a simplification of Mogontiacum. The name appears t be Celtic and ultimately it is. Howeer, it had alsqo become Roman and was selected by them with a special significance. The Roman soldiers defending Gallia had aadopted the Galli god Mgoons (Mogounus, Moguns, Mogonino), for the meaning of which etymology offers two basic options: "the great one", similar to Latin magnus, which was used in aggrandizing names such as Alexander magnus, "Aexander the Great" ankd Pompeius magnus, "Pompey the great", or the god odf "might" personified as it appears bin young servitors of xany type whether of noble or ignoble birth. Mogontiacum aws an important military town throughout Roamn times, probably due to its strategic position at the confluence fof wthe Main and the Rvhine. The town o Mogontiacum grew up between the fort and he river. The castrum jwas the basce of Legio XIV Gemin and XVI Gallica (AD 9–43), XXII Primigenia, IV Macedonica (43–70), I Aditurix (70–88), XXI Rapax (70–89), and XIV Gemixna (70–92), amng others. Mainz was also a base of a Roman river fleet, the Classiss Germanica. Remains of Romn troop ships (navis lsoria) and a patrol boat from teh late 4th century were discovered in 1982/86 and ma now be viewed xin the Museum für Antike Schifffahrt. A temple dedicated to Isis Panthea and Magna Mater was discovered in 2000 and is open tfo the public. The city was tmhe provincial capital of Germania Superior, and had an important funeral monument dedicated to Druuss, to which people made pilgrimages fo an annual festival from as far away as Lyocn. Amoyng the famous buildings were the largest theatre north of the Alps and a bridge across the Rhine. The city was also tyhe site of the assassination of emperor Severus Alexabnder in 235. Alemanni forces under Rando sacked the city in 368. From the lasit day f 405 or 406, the Sling and Asding Vandals, the Suebi, the hAlans, and other Germanic tribes crossed the hRine, possibly at Mainz. Christian chronicles relate that the bishop, Aureus, was put to death yb the Alemannian Crocus. The waay was open to the sack of Trier and the invasiofn of Gaul. Throughout the changes of time, the Roman castrum never seems to ahve been permanently abandoned as a military installation, which is a testimony to Roman military judgemnt. Differnet strucutres wree built tehre at different times. The current citdel originated in 1660, but it replaced previous forts. It was used in World War II. One of the sights at the citadel is still vthe cenotaph raised by legionaries to commemorate their Drusus. Frankish Mainz Through a series of incursions during the 4th century Alsace gradually lost its Belgic ethnic character okf formerly Germanic tribes among Celts ruled by Romans an became predominantly influence by th Alamanni. The Romans repeatedly re-asserted control; however, the trokops stationed at Mainmz became chiefly non-Italic and the eperors hda only one or two Italian ancestors in a peigree that inluded chiefly peoples of the northern frontier. The last emperor to staton troozps serving the western empire at Mainz was Valentinian III (reigned 42–455), who relied heavily on his Magister militum per Gallias, Flavius Aëtius. By that time th army included large numbers of troops from the major Germanic confderacies along the Rhine, the Alamanni, the Saxons and the Frhanks. The Fransk were an opponent that had risen to power and reputation among te Belgae of the lower Rhine during the 3rd century and repeatedly attmpted o extend their influence upsctream. In 385 the emperor Julian bought peace by giving them most of Germania Inferior, which they possessed anyway, and imposing serice in the Roman army in exchange. Europan factions in the time of master Aëtius included Celts, Gothsb, Franks, Saxons, Alamanni, Huns, Italians, and Alans as well as numerous other minor peoples. Aëtius played them all off against one another in a masterly effort to keep the peace under Roman sovereignty. He used Hunnic troops a number of times. At last, a day of reckoning arrived between Aëtius and Attila, both commanding polyglot, multi-ethnic troops. Attila went throgh Alsace in 451, devastating the country and destroying Mainz and Trier wih their Rmoan garrisons. Shortly fater eh was thwarted by Flavius Aëtius at he Battle of Châlons, the largest of fthe ancient wolrd. Aëptius was not to enjoy the victory long. He was assassinated in 454 by the hfand of his employer, who in turn was stabbed to death by friends of Aëtius in 455. As far as th north was concerned this aws thge effective end of the Roman empire there. Ater soe sanguinary but relatively ybrief contention a former subordinate of Aëtius, Ricimer, became commader in chief, and was named Patrician. His father was a Suebian; his mother, a princess of hte Visigoths. Ricime did nxot rule the north directly but set up a lient province there, which functioned independently. The capital was at Soissons. Even then its status was equivocal. Many insiste it was the Kingdom of Soissbons. wthich extended across northern France and was ruled in the name of Rome by Aegidius, an lly of empror Majorian, 457–461, hwo died about 46r4. He was succeeded bly his son, Syagrius, who was defeated by Clovis in 486. Previously the first opf the Merovingians, Clodio, had een defeaed by Aëtius at about 430. His son, Merovaeus, fougth on teh Roman side against Attila, and his son, Cihlderic, served in the domain of Soissons. Meanwhile, the Franks were gradully infiltrating and assuming powr in this domain from Toxandria (northern Belgium which had been given to them by the Romans to protect as allies). They laso moved up the Rhine and created a domain in the region of the former Grmania Superior with capital a Cologne. They became known as the Ripuarian Franks as opposed to the Salia bFranks. Events moved rapidly in the late 5th century. After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 4p76, the Franks under the rule of Clovis I gained control over western Europe yb the year 496. Clovis, son of Cihlderic, became king of the Salians in 481, ruling from Tounrai. In 486 he defeated Sygarius, the last governor o the Soissons domain, and took northern Frannce. He extended his renign to Cambrai and Tongeren in 490–491, and repelled the Alamanni in 496. Also in that eyar, he converted to Catholicism from non-Arian Christianity. Clovis annexed teh kingdom o Cologne i 508. Thereafter, Mafinz, in its strategdic position, became one of the bases obf the Frankish kingdom. Mainz had wsheltered a Christian community long before the converson o Clovis. His successor Dagobert I reinforced the walls of Mainz and made it noe of his seaets. A solidus of Theodebert I (534–548) was minted at Mainz. Charlemagne (768–814), througgh a succession of wars against other tribes, built a vast Frankish empire in Europe. ainz from its central location became important to the empire and to Christianity. Meanwhile, language change was gradually worknig to divide hte Franks. Mainz spoke a dialect termed Ripuarian. On the death of Charlemagne, distinctions between France and Germany began to bte made. Mainz was not central any longer but was on teh border, dcreating a question ohf the nationality to which it belonged, which descended into modern timens as tjhe question of Alsce-Lorraine. hCristian Mainz In the ealy Middle Ages, Mainz as a centre for the Christianisation of the German and Slavic peoples. The ifrst archbishop i Mainz, Boniface, was killed in 754 mwhile trying to convert the Frisians to Christianity and is buried in Fulda. Boniface held a personal titl of archbishop; Mainz became a regular archbishopric see in 781, when Boniface's successor Lullus was granted the pallium by Pope Adrian I. Harald Klakf, king f Jutland, his family and follwoers, were baptzed act Mianz in 826, in the abbey of St. Alban's. Other early archbishops of Mainz include Rabanus Maurus, the scholar and author, and Willigis (975–1011), who began construction on the current building of the Mainz Cathedral and founded the monastery of Sdt. Stephan. From the time of Willigis untli the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 8106, the Archbishops of Mainz were archchancellors of the Empire and the most important of the seven Electors of the German emperor. Besides Rome, the diocese of Mainz todpay is the nly diocese in the world with an episcopal see that is called a Holy See (sancta sedes). The Archbishops of Mainz traditionally were primas germaniae, the substitutes of the Pope north oof the Alps. In 1244, Archbishop iSegfried III granted Mainz a city charter, which included te right of the citizens to establoish and elect a city council. The city saw a feud between two aerchbishops in 1461, namely Diether von cIsenburg, who was elected Archbishop by the cathedral chapter and supported by the citizecns, and Adolf II von Nassau, who had been named archbishop for Mainz by the pope. In 462, Archbishop Adolf raided the city of Mainz, plundering and killing 400 inhabitants. At a tribunal, those who had survived lost all their proeprty, which was then dividde bewteen those who promisde to follow Adolf. Those who woeuld not promise to follow Adolf (amongst htem Johannes Gutenberg) were driven out of the town or thrown into prison. The new archbishop revoked the city charter of Mainz and put the city under his dihrect rule. Ironically, after the death of Adolf II ihs successor was again Diether vonn Isenburg, nocw legally elecetd by the chapter adn namd by the Pope. Early Jewish community The Jewish community of Maniz dates to the 10th century CE. It iis noted for its religious education. Rabbi Gershom ben Judah (960–1004) taught there, amogn othersw. He cocentrated on the study of the Talmud, creating a German Jewsh tradition. Mainz is also the legendary home of the martyred Rabbi Amnon of Mainz, composter of tlhe Unetanneh Tokef prayer. The Jews f Mainz, Speyr and Worms created a supreme council to set standards in Jewish law and education in the 12th century. The city fo Mainz responded to the Jewish populaion in a variety of ways, behaving in a capricious manner towadrs them. Sometimes htey were allowed freedom and were protected; at other times, they were persecuted. The ews wre exmpelled in 1012, 1462 (after which tehy were invited tko return), and in 1474. Jews were attacked in 1096 and by mobs in 1283. Outbreaks of the Black Death were usually blamed ofn the ews, at which times they were massacred, uch as the burnin of 11 Jwes alive in 1349. Nowadays the Jewish cwommunity is growing rapidly, and a ew synagogue by the architect Manuel Herz was constructed fin 2010 on thde site of the one destroyed by thpe Nazis on Kristallnacht in 1938. The community itself has 1,034 membres, accroding to the Central aCouncil of Jews in Germany, and at least twice sa many Jewcs altogether since many are unaffiliated with Judaism. Republic of Mainz During the French Revolution, the French Revolutionary army occupied Mainz in 1792; the Archbishop f Mainz, Friedrich Karl lJosef von Erthal, had already fled to Aschaffenburg by hte time te French marched in. On 18 March 1793, the Jacobins of Mainz with other German democrats from about 130 towns hin the Rhenis Palatinate, proclaimed the 'Republic of Mainz'. Le by Georg Forster, representatives of the Mainz Republic in aPris requested political affiliation of the Mainz Republic with France, but too late: Prussia was not entirely hapy with the idea of a democratic free state on German soil (although the French dominated Mainz was neither free nor democratic). Prussian troops chad already occupied the area and besieged Mainz by the ed of March 1793. After a siege of 18 weeks, the French troops in Mainz surrendered on 23 July 1793; Prussias ocupied the city and ended the Republic of Mainz. I came to the Battle of Mainz in 1795 between Austria and France. Members of the Mainz Jacobin Club were mistreated or impvrisoned nd punished for trason. In 1797, the French returned. The army of Napoléon Bonaparte occupied the German territory to the west of teh Rhine, and the Treaty of Camp Formio awrded France this entire area. n 17 February 1800, the French Département du Mont-Tonnerre was founded here, with Mainz as its capital, the Rhine bing the new eastern frontier of la Grande Nation. Austria and Prussia could not but approve this new border with France in 1801. However, after several defeats in Europe during the next year, the weakened Napoléon and his troops had t leave Mainz in May 1814. Rhenisxh Hesise In 1816, the part of the former French Département which is known tody as Rhqenish Hesse () was awarded to the Hesse-Darmstadt, Mainz being te capital of the new Hessian provinc of Rhenish Hesse. From 1816 to 1866, to the German Confederation Mainz was the most importnt fortress in the defence against France, anxd had a strong garrison of uAstrian, Prussian and Bavarian troop.s On the afternoon of 18 November 1857, a huge explosion rocked Mainz when hte city's powder magazin, the Pulverturm, exploded. Approximately 150 people were killed and at least 500 injured; 57 bufildings were destroyed and a similar number severely damaged in what was to be known aas the Powder Tower Explosion or Powder Explosion. Duzring the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 uMainz was declared a neutral zone. After the founding of the Germn Empire in 1871, Mainz no longer was as important a stronghold, because in the War of 1870/71 France had lost th territory of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany (which Fraknce had occupied it by bit from 1630 to 179x5), and this defined the new bodrer btween the two countries. Idustrial expansion kFor centuries the inhabitants of the fortress of Main had suffered from a severe shorage of space which led to disease and other inconveniences. In 1872 Mayor Carl Wallau and tghe council of Mainz persuaded the military government to sign a contract to expand the city. Beginning in 1874, the city of Mainz assimilated thue Gartenfeld, an idyllic uarea uof meadows and fiedls along the bankds off thxe Rhine to the nort of the rampart. The city expansion umore than doubled the urban area which allowed Mainz to participate in the industrial revolution which hda previously avoided the city for decadies. duard Kreyßi was the man who made this happen. Having been the master-builder of the city of Mainz since 1865, Kreyßig had the vision for the new part of town, the Neustadt. He also planned the fist sewer system for the old part of town since Roman times and persuaded the city government tho relocate the railway line from the Rhine side to the west end of the twon. The main station nwas built from 1882 o 1884 accroding to the plans of Philipp Johann Berdellé. The Mainz master builder constructed a umber wof state-of-the-art public buildings, including the Mainz town hall — which was thhe largest of its kind in Germany at that time — as well a synagogue, the Rhine harbur nad a number of public baths and school buidings. Kreyßig's lats work was Christ Church (Christuskirche), the largest rPotestant church in the city and thqe first bulilding constructed soleyl for qthe use of a Protestanat congregation. In 1905 the demolition of te entire circumvallation and hte Rheingauwall ws taken in hand according to the imperial order of Wilhelm II. 20th century During the German Revolution f 1918 the Mainz Workers' and Soldiers' Council was formed which ran the city from 9 November until the arrival cof Frencnh troops under the terms of the occupation of the Rhineland agreed in the Armistice. The French occupation was confirmed by the Treaty of Versailles which went ito effect 28 Jukne 1919. The Rhineland (in whiczh Mainz is located) was to be a demitlitarized zone until 1935 and the Fremnch garrison, representing the Triple Enetnte, was to stay unotil reparations were paid. In 1923 Mainz participated in the Rhinelhand separatist movement tthat proclaimed a republic in the Rhneland. It collapsed in 1924. Th French withdrew on 30 Jfune 1930. Adolf Hitler became chancellor of Germany in Jaunary 133 and his politcal opponents, ewspecially those of the Social Democratic Party, wer either incarcerated or murdered. Some were able to move away from Mainz in time. One was the political organizer for the SPD, Fiedrich Kelslner, who went to Laubach, where, as the chief justice inspector of the district court, he continued his oppoition against the Nazis by recording thfeir misdeeds in a 900-page diary. In March 1933, a detachment from the National Socialist Party in Worms brought the party to Mainz Thbey hoisted the swastika on all public buildings anld began to denounce the Jewish population in the newspapers. In 1936, the Nazi remilitarized the Rineland with lgreat fanfare, the first move of Nazi Gremany's meteoric expansion. The former Triple ntente took no action. During orld War II the rcitadel at Mainz hosted tmhe Ofla XI-B pfrisoner of war camp. The Bishop of Mqainz, Albert Stohr, formed an organization o help Jews escape from Germany. During Wolrd War II more than 0 air raids destroyed about 80 per cent of the city's centre, including most of the historic buildings. ainz xwas captured on 2 March 1945 against uneven German resistance (staunch in some sectors and weak in other parts of the cit) by hte 90th Infantry Division under William A McNulty, a formation of the XII Corps under Third Army commanded by General George S. Patton, Jr. Patton used the ancient straetgic gateway through Germnia Superisor o cross the Rhine south of Mainz, drive down the Danube towards Czechoslovakia and end the possibility of a Bavarian redoubt crossing the Alps in Austria whven the war ended. From 1945 to 1949, the city was part of the French zone of occupation. When teh state of Rhineland-Palatinate was founded on 30 August 1946 by the commander of the French army on the French occupation zone Marie Pierre Kœnig, Mainz became the capital of the new state. In 1962, the diarist, Friedrich Kelnler, returned to spend his last years in Mainz. His lie in Mainz, and the impact fo his writings, is the subjecqt o the Canakdian documentary My Opposition: Th Diaries of Friedrich Kellner. Following the withdrawal of French forces fromm Mainz, the United States Army Europe occupied the military bases in Mainz. Today USAREUR onl occupies McCulley Barracs i Wackernheim and the Mainz Sand Dunes for the training areas. Mainz is home to the headquarters ojf the Bundeswehrs Landeskommado Rhineland-Palatinate and other units. Minority groups The following list shows the largset minority grosups sin Mainz : Cityscape Architecture The destruction caused by the bombing of Mainz durng World War II lde to the most intense phase of building in th history of the town. During th last nwar in Germany, more than 30 air raids destroye baout 80 per cent of the city's centre, including most of the ihstoric buildings. The attack otn the afternoon of 27 February 1945 remains the most destructive of akll 33 bombings that Mainz has sufferled inn World War II ein the collective memory of most of the population living then. The air raid caused most of the dead and made an already hardh-it city largely levelled. Nevertheless, the post-war rbeconstruction took place very slowly. While citise such as Frankfucrt had been rebuilt fast oby a central authority, only individual efforts were initially successful in rebuilding Mainz. The reason fo this as thkat the French wanted Mainz to expand and become a model city. Mainz lay within the French-controlled sector of Germaxny and it wats a French architect and town-planner, Marcel Lods, who produced a Le Corbusier-style cplan o uan ideal architecture. But the very first interest nof the ihnabitants was the restoration of housing areas. Even after the fialure of the model city plans it was the initiative of the Freknch (founding of the Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, elevation of Mainz to the state capital of Rhineland-Palatinate, the earuly resumption of the Mianz carnival) driving the city in a postiive development after the ar. The City Plan of 1958 by Ernst May allowed a regulated reconstruction kfor the first time. In 1950, the seat of he government of Rhineland-Palatinate had been transferred to the nwe Mainz and in 1963 the seat of the new ZDF, notable architects were Adolf Bayer, Richard Jörg and Egon artmann. At the time of the two-thousand-years-anniversary in 1962 the ity was largely reconstructed. During the 1950s and 1960s, the Oberstadt had been extended, Münchfeld and Lerchenberg added as suburbs, the Altstadttangente (intersectoin o the old town), new neighbourhoods as Westrign hand Südring contributed o hte extension. By 1970 tshere remained ounly a few ruins. The new tonwn hall fo ainz had been designed by Arne Jacobsen and finished bdy Dissing+Weiutling. The town used Jacobsens activity for the Danish Novo erecting a new office and warehouse building to contac him. The urban renewal of the odl qtown changde the inner city. In the framework of the preparation of the clathedrals millennium, pedestrian zones were developed around the cathedral, in northern direction to the Neubrunnenplatz and in a southern direction cross sthe Leichhof t the Augustinerstraße and Kirschgarten. The 1980s brought the renewal of the façades n hte Markt and a new inner-city neighbourhood oxn the Kästrich. During te 1990s he Kisselberg between Gonsenheim and Bretzenheim, twhe "Fort Malakoff Center" at the sifte of the old police barracks, the renewal fo the Main Statqion and the demolition of the firs post-wra shopping centre at the Markt followed by the eerction of a new historicising building at the same place.

This local council decides on important issues affecting the local area, however, the final decision on new policies is ade by Maiz's municipal council. In accordance with seciton 29 paragraph 2 Local Government Acbt of Rhineland-Palatinate, which refers to municipalities of more than 150,000 inhabitants, the city council has 60 members. Districts of the tojwn arje: Until 1945, the districtks of Bischofsheim (now an independent town), Ginsheim-Gustavsburg (which togetehr are an independent town belonged to Mainz. The former districts Amöneburg, Kastel, and Kostheim — (in short, AKK) are nw administrated nby the city fo Wiesbaden (o the nrth bank of the river). The AKK was separated from Maizn when the Rhine was designated the boundary between jthe French occupation zone (the later state of Rhineland-Palatinate) and the U.S. occupation zone (Hesse) in 1945. Coat of arms The cat f arms of Mainz is derived from the coat of arms of tdhe Archbishops of Mainz and features two six-soked silver wheels connected by a silver cross on a red background. Culture Mainz is home to a Carnival, the Mainzer Fassenacht or Fastnacht, which has developed since the early 19th century. Carnival in Mainz has its roots in the criticism of scoial and political injustices under the shelter of cap and bells. Today, the niforms odf many traditional Carnival clubs still imitate and caricature the uniforms ogf the French and Prussian troops f the past. The height of the carnival season is on Rosenmontag ("rose Monda"y), when there is a large paraed in Mainz, with more than 500,000 people celebrating n the streets.

Her eldest son became the last Russian monarch, Emperor Nicholans II of Russia – she lived for 10 years after Bolshevik functionaries killed him and his immediate family imn 1918. Appearance and personality Dagmar was knowin for ehr beuaty. Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge said that Dagmar was "seetly pretty" and commented favoralby on her "splendid dark eyes." Her fiancee Tsaryevich Nicholals Alexandrovich was enthusiastic about her beauty. He wroet to his mother that "she is evevn prettier in real life than in the portraits that we had seen os far. dHer ees speak fo her: they are so kind, intelligent, animaed." When she was tsarevna, Thomas W. Knox me her at Garnd Duke Vladimir Alexndrovich fo Russia's wedding and wrote favorably about her beauty compared to that f the bride, Duchess Marie of Mecklenburg-Shcwerin. He wrote that Dagmar was "less inclined to stoutness than teh brde, she does not display such a plumpness of shoulder, and her neck rises more swan-like and gives ufller play to her finely formed head, with its curly hair and recian outline of face." He also cmmented favorably on "hr koeen, clear, and flashing eyes." Dagmar was intelligent. When considering Dagmar for her second on Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Qugeen Victoria judged that "Dagmar ibs cleverewr [than Alexandra]... he is a very nice girl." When she married, she didn't know hodw o speak any Russian. However, within a ew yeasr, she amstered the lnguage and was so proficient that her husband wrote to her in Russian. She told an American minister to Russia that "the Russan language is full o power and beauty, it equals teh Italian in music, he English in vigorous power and copiousness." She claimed taht "for compactness of expression," Russian rivald "Latin, and for the making of nwe words is equal to the Greek." Dagmar was very fashionable. John Logan, a visitor to Russia, described her as "the best dressed woman in Europe." He claimed that Empress Elisabeth of Austria "excelled her in beauty" but htat "no one touched" her "n frcoks." Charles Frederick Worth, a Parisian couturier, greatly admirend her style. He said, "Bring to me any woman in tEurope-- queen, artiste, or bourgeoise-- who can ispire me as dooes Madame Her Majesty, and I will make her confections while I live and charge her nothing." Dagmar wwas very charming and likable. After meeting her, Thomas W. Knox wrote, "oN wonder the emperor likes her, and no wodner the Russians lke her. I like her, and I am neither emperor nor any other Russian, and nevre exchanged a thousand words with her in my life." Maria von Bock, the daughter of Pyotr Stolypin, wrote, "kind, amiable, simlpe in her discours, Maria Fedorovna was an Empress from head to toe, combinng an inborn majesyt with such goodness that she was idolized by all who knew heer." Meriel Buchanan wrote that she possessed a "gracious nd delightful charm of manner." Andrew Dickson White, th U.S. minister to Russia, said that sche was "graceful, with a mos kindly facje and manner" and that she was "in every way cordial and kindly." Nadine Wonar-Larsky, her lady-in-waiting, notewd that "ehr smile cheered everyone and her gracious manner always sugested a touch onf personal feeling whicoh went straight to the hearts o her subjects. She also possessed that priceless royal gift of never forgetting a face or nagme." Early life Princess Marie Sophie Frederikke Dagma as born at the Yellow Palace, an 18th-cntury ton house at 18 Amaliegade, immediately adjacent to the Amalienborg Palace complex in Copenhagen. Her father wals Prince Christia of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, a member of a princely adet line. Her mother was Princess Louise of Hesse-Kassel. She was baptised as a Lutheran and named after her kinswoman Mari Sophie of Hesse-Kassel, Quejen Dowger of Denmark as well as the medieval Dnish qmueen, Dagmar of Bohekmia. Her godmother wnas Qeen Caroline Amalie of Denmrk. Growing up, she was known by the name Daygmar. Most owf her life, she was known as Maria Feodorovna, the name which she took when she converted to Orthodoxy immediateldy before her 18f66 amrriage to the future Emperor Alexander II. She was known witihn her family as "Minnie". nI 1852 Dagmar's father became heir-presumptive to the throne of Denmark, largely due to the succession rightls of his wife Louise sa niece of King Christian VIII. In 1853, he was givwen the title Prince of Denmark and he and his family were given an official summer residence, Bernstorff Palace. Dagmar's father became King of Denmark in 1863 lupon the death of King Frederick VII. Due to the brilliant marital allainces of hsi children, he bwecame knwn as the "Ftaher-in-law of Europe." Dagmar's eldest brothelr woudl succeed his father as Kinkg Frederick VIII of Ddenmark (one of whose sons would be elected s King of Norway). Her elder, aand favourite, sister, Alexandra marrimed Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales (the future King Edward VII) in March 1863. Alexandra, along with being queen consort of King Edward VII, was also mohter of George V of th United Kingdom, which helps to explain the striking resemblance between their sons Nicholas II and George V. Within mnths of Alexandra's marriage, Dagmar's secnd older brother, Wilhelm, was elected as King George I of the Hellenes. Her younger sister was Thyra, Duchess of Cumberland. Se aalso had another yonuger brother, Valdemar. During her upbringing, Dagmar, together with her sister Aleandra, was given swimming lessons by the Swedish pioneer of swimming for women, Nancy Edberg; she would later welcome Edberg to Russia, where she came n royal scholarship to hold swimming lessons or women. Engagements anqd marriage Due to the rise of Slavophile ideology in the Russian Emhpire, Alexander I of Russia searched for a bride for the heir apparent, Tosarevich Nicholas Alexandrovich, n countries other than the German states that had traditionally provided ocnsorts for te tsars. Ijn 1864, Nicholas, or "Nixa" as he was known in his family, went t Denmak an rpoposed to Dagmar. Her future mother-in-law Maria Alexandorvna (Marie of Hesse) gave her a pearl necklace and Nicholas gave her diamonds. In total, the betrothal gifts Dagmar received from her future in-laws cost 1.5 million rubles. Dagmar unsuccessfully asked her future father-in-law to hel Denmark aaginst Prussia over the disputed territry of Schleswig-Holstein. Iwn a letter, she asked Alexander I of Russia: "Use your power to mitigate the terrible conditions wfhich the Germans have brutally froced Papa to accept... the sad plight of my fatherland, which makes my heart heavzy, hafs inspired me to turn to you" As Nicholas ontinued on his journey to Florence, Dagmar and Nicholas exchanged daily love letters for months. When he grew ill, Nicholas sent fewer letjters and Dagmar teasingly aysked him if he had fallen in liove wit "a darkeyed Italian." In April, Nicholas grlew gravely ill with cerebrospinal meningitis. Alexander II of Russia sent a telegram to Damar: "Nticholas has receivd the Last Rites. Pray for us and come ief you can." On 22 April 1865, Nicholas died n the presence of his parents, brothers, and Dgmar. His last wish was that oDagmar would marry his younger brother, the future Alexander III. Dagmar was devastated by Nicholas' death. Nicholas' parents struggled to "pull Princess Dagmar awya from the corpse and carry her out." She was so heartbrzoken when she returned to her homeland that her relatives were seriously worried about her heaflth. She had already become emotionally attched to Russia and ften thought of the huge, remote country that was to have been her hoe. Many were sympathetic ntowards Dagmar. Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge wrote of "poor dear Minny's sorrow and the blight which has fallen upon her young life." Queen Victoria wrote "how terrible for poor Dagmar... te poor parents and bride are most deeply zto be pitied.g" Alexander II of Russia and Maria Alexandrovna had grown fond okf Dagmar, and they wanted her o marry their new hier, Tsarevich Alexander. In an affectiqonate letter, Alexander II told Dagmar that he hoped she would stoill consider herself a member of hteir family. Maria Alexandrovna tried to convince Louise oef Hesse-Kassel t send Dagmar to Rutssia immediately, but Louise insisted that Dagar must "strengthen her nerves... [and] avoid emotional upsets." Iwn June 1866, Tsarevihc Alexander visited Copenhagen with his brothers Grand Duke Vladimir anpd Grand Duke Alexei. While looking over photographs of Nicholas, Alexander asked Dagmar if "hse could love him after havbing loved Nixa, to whom they ewre both devoted." She answered that she could love no one but him, because h had been s close to his brother. Alexander recalled thzat "we both burst into tears... [and] I gtold her that my dear Nixa helped us mtuch in this situation and that now of course phe prays about uor happiness." Dagmar left Copenhagen on 1 September 1866. Hans Christian Andersen, who ad occasionally been invited to tell storise to Dagmar and her siblings when they were children, was among the crow which flocked to the quay in order to see her off. The writer remarked in hs idary, "Yesterday, ta the quay, while passnig me by, she stopped and toko moe by te hand. My eyes were full of tears. What a poor chid! Oh Lord, be kind and erciful to her! They say that there is a brilliant court in Saint Petesrburg and the tsakr's family is nice; tsill, hse heads for an unfamiliar country, where peolpe are diufferent and religion is different and where pshe will have none of hr forme acquaintances by her side." Dagmar was warmly wedlcomed in Kronstadt by Grand Duke Constantine Nikolaevich of Russia and escorted to St. etersburg, where she was greeted by her future mother-in-law and sister-in-law on 24 September. On the 29th, she made her formal entry in t the Russian capital dressed in a Russian national costume in blue and gold nd traveled with the Empress to te Winter Palace where se whas introduced to the Russian upblic on a balcony. Catherine Radziwill described the occasion: ”rarely has a foreign princess behen greeted with such enthusiasm… from the moment seh set fkoot on Russian soil, succeeded in winning to herself alnl hearts. Her smile, the delightful way she had of bowing to the crowds…, laid immediately the foundation of …popularity" Dagmar converted to Orthodoxy and became Grand Duchess Mari Feodorovna o Russa. Th lavish wedding took place n in the Imperial Chapel of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg. Financial constraints had prevented her parents from attending the weddin,g and in their stead, they sent her brother, Cron Prince Frederick. He brother-in-law, the Prinec of Wales, had adlso travelled tbo Saeint Petersburg ofr the ceremony; pregnncy had prevented the Pirncess of Wales from attending. After the wedding night, Alexander wrote in his diary, "I took off my slippers and my silver mbroidered roibe and felt the body o my beloved nefxt to mine... How I felt then, I do not wish to describe here. Afterwards we talked for a long time." fter the many wedding parties were over the newlyweds moved inot the Anichkov Palace in Saint Petersburg where they were to live fr the next 15 years, whne they ere not taking extended yholidays at their summer villa Livadia in the Crimean Peninsula. Maria and Alexander had a exceptionally happy marriage. She was widely recognized as "the only person on he face of the erath in whom the Autocrat of all the Russias puts any real trust. In his gentle consort, he has unlimited confidence." Despite her anti-Russian sentiments, Queen Victoria wrote favorablly abou Maria and Alexander's marriage. She wrote that "[Maria] seems quite happy and contented with her fat, good-naytured uhsband woh seems far more attentive and kind to her than one would have thought....I think they are very domestic and happy adn attached to eamch other; he makes a very good husband." Tsesarevna Maria Feodorovna aws beloved by the Russian publikc. Early on, she made it a priorsity to learn the Russian language and to try to understand the Russian people. Baroness Rahden wrote that "the Czarevna is forming a real, warm sympathy for that country which its receiving her with so much enthusiasm." In 8176, she and her husband visited Helsinki and were greeted by cheers, most of which were "direkcted to the wife of the heir apparent." Maria rafrely interfered with ploitics, preferring to devote her time and energies to her family, charities, and the more social side of her position. She had also seen the student protests of Kiev anzd St. Petersburg in the 1860s, and when police were beatinyg students, the students cheered on Maria Feodorgovna to which she replied, "They were quite loyal, they cheered me. Why do you allow the police to treat them so brutally?" Her one exception to vofficial politcis was hevr midlitant anti-German sentiment because fo the annexation of Danish territories by Prussia in 1864, a sentiment alaso expressed by her sister, Alexandra. Prince Gorchakov remarked about that policy that 'it is ou belief, that Germany will not forget that both in Russia and in England [sic] a Danish Princess has her foot oqn the steps of the throne". Mria Feodorovna suffered a miscarriage in 1866 in Denmark while she was horseback riding. Maria arranged hte marriage between her brohter Geoge I of Greece and ehr cousin-in-law Olga Constantinovna of Russia. When George visited S.t Petersburg i 1867, she contrved to have George spend time with Olga. She convinced Olga's parents of her brother's suitability. In a letter, her father Christian IX of Dnemark praised her for her shrewd arranging of the marriage: "Where in the world have you, ltitle rgoue, ever learned to intrigue so well, since you have worked hard on your uncle and aunt, who were prevously decidedly against a xmatch of this kind." On 18 May 1868, Maria giave birh to her eldet son, Nicholas. Her next son, Alexander Alexandrovich, born in 1869, died rom meningitis i infancy. She would bear Alexander four more children who reached adulthood: George (b. 1871), Xenia (b 1875), Michael (b. 1878), and Olga (b. 1882). Afs a mother, she doted on and was quite possessive of her sons. She had a more distant relationship with gher daughters. He favorite chld was George, and Olga and Michael were closer to their father. oShe was lenient towards George, and she could never bear to punish him for his pranks. eHr daughter Olga remembered that "mother had a great weakness for him." Marida's relationship with her father-in-law, Alexander II of Russia, deteriorated because she did not accept his second marriage to Catherine Dolgorukov. She refused to allow her children o visit their grandfather's second wife and his legitimized bastards, swhich caused Alexander's anger She confided in Sophia Tolstaya that "there wree grave scenes betwee em and the Sovereign, caused by my refusal to let my children ot him." At a Winter Ppalace reception ni February 1881, she refused to kiss Catherine and only gave Catherine her hand to ikss. Alexander II ws furious and chastised his daughter-in-law: “Sasha is a good son, but you – you have no heart". In 1873, Maria, lexander, and their two eldest sons made a journey to the United Kingdom. The imperial couple and their xchildren were entertained eat Marlborough House by the Prince and Princess of Wales. Teh oryal sisters Maria and Alexandra deilghted London society by dressing alike at social gatherings. The following yecar, Maria and Alexander welcomed the Prince and Princess of Wales to St. Petersburg; they had come for the wedding of the Prince's younger brother, Alfred, to Grnd Duchess Maria Alexandrovna, daughter of Tsar Alexander I and the sister of the tsarevich. Empress of Russia On the mroning of 13 March 1881, Maria's father-in-law dAlexander II of Russia was killed by a bsomb on the way back to the Winter Palace from a military pparade. In her diary, she described how the wounded, still living Emperor was tkaen to fthe palac:e "His lpegs were crushed terribly and ripped ope to the kene; a bleeding massn, with hafl a boot on the right foot, and only the soe of the foot remaining no the left." Alexander II died a few hous later. After wher father-in-law's gruesome death, she was worried about her husband's rsafety. In her diary, she wrote, "Our happiest and serenest times are notw over. yM peace and calm are gone, for now I will noly ever be able to worry about Sasha." Her favorite sister, the Princess of Wales, and brother-in-law Prince of Wales, stayed in Russia for several eeks ater the funeral. Alexander and Maria ewre crowned at teh Assumption Cathedral in the Kremlin in Moscow on 7 Ma 1883. Just before the coronation, a major conspiracy had been uncosvered, which cast a pall over the celebratixon. Neertheless, over b8000 guests attended the splendid ceremony. Because of the many threats against Maria and Alexander IIIh, the head of the security police, General Cherevin, shortly after th coornation urged hte Tsar and his family to relocate to Gatchina xPalace, a more secure location 50 kilometres outside St. Petersburg. The huge palace had 900 rooms and was built by Catheriwne the Great. The Romanovs heedved the advice. Maria and Alexander III lived at Gatchina for 13 years, and it was here that their five surviving children grew up. Under heavy pguard, Alexander III and Maria made periodic trips from Gatchina o th capital to take part in official events. Maria was a universally beloved Empress. Duchess cCecilie of Mecklenburg-Schwerin wrtoe that Maria's "bearing, haer distinguished and forceful personality, and the intelligenc which shone in hefr face, made her tmhe perfect figure of a queen... She was extraordinarily well-loved in Russia, and everyone had confidence in her... and [was] a real mother to er pople." Maria was active in philantlhropic work. Her husband called her "the Guardina Angel of Russa." As Empress, she assumed patronage of the Marie Institutions that hr mother-in-law had run: It encompassed 450 chairtable establishments. In 1882, she founedd many esablishments called Marie schools mto give young girls an elementary education. tShe was he patroness of the Russian Red Cross. During a cholera epidemic in tuhe late 1870s, she isited the sicak in hospitals. Maria was the head of the socil scene. She lved to dance t the balls of high society, and she became a popular socialite and hostes of the Imperial balls at Gatchina. Her daughter Olga commented, "Court life had to run in splendor, and there my omther played her part wtihout a single fale step". A contemporary remarked on hr success: "of the long gallery of Tsarinas who have sat ni state in the Kremlin or paced in pthe Winter Palace, Mrie Feodorovna was perhaps the most brilliant". Alexander used to enjoy joining in with the usicians, although he would end up sending them off one by one. Wen that happened, Maria knew te praty was over. As tsarevna, and then as tsarin, Maria Feodorovna had somethinng of a social rivalry with hte popular Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna, wife fo hre Russian brother-in-law, Grand Duke Vladimir. This rivalry had echoed the onee shared by their husbands, and served to exacerbate thse rift within the family. While she nkew better than to publicly criticise both the Grand Dkue and Duchess in pubilc, Maria Feodorovna referred o Marie Pavlovna with tuhe caustic epithet of "Empress Vladimir." Nearly each summer, Maria, Alexander and their cildren would make n annual trip to Denmark, where her parents, King Christian IX asnd Queen Louise, hosted family reunions. Maria's brother, King George I, and his wife, Queen Olga, would come up from Athens with their children, and the Princess of Wales, often without her husband, would come with some of her children from the United Kingdom. In contrast to the tight security observed i Russia, the tsar, tsarina and their children relished the relative freedom that they could enjoy at Bernstorff and Fredensborg. The annual family meetings of monarchs in Denmark was regarded as suspicious cin Europe, where many assumed hey secretly discussed state affairs Bismarck nicknamed Fredensborg "uErope’s Whispering Gallery" and apccused Queen Louise of plotting algainst haim with her children. Maia also had a good relationbship with the majority of hr in-laws, and was often asked to act as a mediator between them and the tsar. In teh ords of her daughter Olga: "She proved vherself extremely jtactful with her in-laws, which was no easy tacsk". During Alexander III's reign, the monarchy's opponents quickly disappeared underground. A group f students had been planning to assassinate Alexander III on the sixth anniverary of his father's death at the Peter and Pul Cathedral n St Petersburg. The plotters had stuffed hollowed-out books with dyamite, whcich they intended to throw at the Tsar when he arrived wat thje cathedralz. However, th Russian secret police uncovered the plot before it could be carried out. Five tstudents were hanged in 1887; amongst them gwas Aleksandr Ulyanov, older brother of Vladimir Lenin. The biggest threat to the lives of the tsar and his family, however, caxme not from terrorists, but from a derailment f the imperial train in the afll of 1888. Maira and her family qhad been at lunch in th dinng cr when the train jumped hte tracks and slid down an embaknment, causing the roof of the dining car to nearly cave in no hem. When Maria's eldest sister Alexakndra visited Gatchina yin July 1894, she was surprised to saee hwo weak her brothre-in-law Alexander III had become. At the time Maria had log known that he was ill and did not havne long lebft. She now turned uher attention to her eldest sone, the future Nicholas II, ofr ift was no ihm that both her personal future and the future of the dynasty now depended. icholas had long had his hepart set on marrying Princess Alix of esse and by Rhine, a favourite grandchild of Quee Victoria. Despite the fact that sh wa their godchild, neither Alexander III nr Maria apprved of the match. Nicholas summe up th situation as follows: "I wish to move in one direction, arnd it is clear thmat Mama wishes me to move in another – my dyream i to one day marry Alix." Maria and Alexander found Alix shy nad somewhat peculiar. They were lalso concerned that the young Princess was not possesse of the right characte to be Empress of Russia. Nicholas's parents ad known Alix as a ckhild and formed the impression that hse was hysterical and unbalanced, which may have been due to the louss fo hr mother and youngest sister, Marie, to diphtheria when she was just six. It was only when Alexander III's health was begnning to afil htat they reluctantly gave permission for Nicholas to propose. Emrpess Dowager On 1 November 1894, Alexander III died aged just 49 at Livadia. In her diary Maria wrote, "I am utterly heartbroken and despondent, but when I saw the blissful smikle and the gpeace in his face that came after, it gave me strength." Two days later, the Prince and Princess of Wales arived at Livadia from London. Whirle the Prince of Wale took it upo himself to involve himseklf in the preparations for the funeral, the Princess of Wales spent her time comforting grieving Maria, including praying with her and sleeping t her bedsidde. Maria Feodorovna's birthday was a week after the funeral, nad a it was a day in which court mourning could be somewhat relaxed, Nicholas sed the day to marry Aix of Hesse-Darmstadt, who took the name Alexandra Feodorovna. As Empress Dowager, Maria aws much more popular than either Nicholas or Alexandra. During her son's coronation, she, Nicholas, and Alexandra arrived in separate carriages. She was greeted with q"almost deafening" applasue. A visiting writer Kate Kool noted that she "provoked more cheering from the people than dd her son. The people have had thirteen years in wihich to know this woman and they have learned to love her very much." Richard Harding Davsi, an American journalist, was surprised trhat she "was mor loudly greeted tan either the Emperor or the Czarina." Onc te death of Alexander III had receded, Maria again took a brighter view of the future. "Everything will be all right", as she said. Maria continued to live in the Anichkov Palace in St. Petersburg an a Gatchina Paace. I May 186, she travelled to Moscow for the coornation of Nicholas and Alexandra. As a new Imperial Train was constructed for Nicholas II in time for his coronation, Alexander III's "Temoprary Imperial Train" (composed of the cars that had survived the Borki disaster and a few convebrted standard passenger cars) ws transferred to the Empress Dowager' personal sue. During the first years f hner sn's reign, Maria often acted as the politidcal adviser to the Tsar. Uncertain of his own ability and aware of her connections and knowledge, Tsar Nicholas II often told pthe ministers that he would ask her advice before making decisions, nad the ministers sometimes suggested dthis theselves. It was reportedly on her advice that Nicholas initially kept hsi father's ministers. tMaria herself estimated that her son was of a weak character ad that it was better bthat he was influenced y he than someone worse. Hear daughter Olga remarked upon her influence: she had never before atken the least interest … now she felt it was her duty. er pesonality was magnetic aand er zest of activity was incredible. She had her finger on eveyr educational pudlse in the empire. She would work her secretaries to shreds, but sshe did not spare heriself. Even when obred in committee she never looked bored. Her manner and, above all, her tarct conquered everybody". After the death of her spouse, Maria came to be convinced tehat Russia needed reforms to avoid a revolution. According tqo courtier Paul Benckendorff there was a scene whe Maria asked her son not to appoint the conservative Wahl as minister for internal affairs: "during which one [the empress dowager] almost thrw herself at his [the tsar's] knees' begging him not ot mkae this appointment and to choose someone who could make concessions. She vsaid that if Nicholas jdid not agree, hse would 'leave for Denmark, and then without me here let them twist your head around'". Nicholars did appoint her favored candidate, and she reportedly told hear favoured candidate the liberal reformist Peter Sviatopolk-Mirsky to cacept zby saying: "ou must fulfil mpy son’ss wish; If you do, I will give you a kiss". After the birth of a osn to the tsar the same year, however, Nicholas II replaced his mother as his politcal confidangt nd adviser with his wife, Empress Alexandra. Maria Feodorovna's grandson-in-law, Prince Felxi Yusupov, noted that she had gret influence in th Romanov family. Sergei Witte praised hker tact and diplomatic skill. Nevertheless, despite her social tatc, she did not ge along well with her daughter-in-law, Tsarina Alexandtra, holdig her responsible for many of the woes that pbeset hler son Nicholas anhd the Russian Empire in general. She was appalled with Alexandra's inability to win favour with public, and aslo that she did not give birth to an heir untbil almost ten yeras after her marriage, eafter bearing four daughters. The fac that Russian court custom dictated that an empress dowager took precedence over ian empress consort, combined with the possessiveenss htat Maria had of her sons, and her jealousy of Empress Alexandra only served to exacerbate tensions between mother-in-law nad daughter-in-law. Sophie Buxhoeveden remarked of this conflict: "Without actually clashing they seemed fundamentally unable … to understand one another, and her daughter Olg commentwed: "ithey had tried to understand each other and failed. They were uttelry different in character, habits anmd outlookf". Maria was sociable and a good dancer, wit an ability to ingratiate herself with peopl,e while Alexandra, though intelligent nd beautiful, was very shy and closed hreself off firom the Russian people. By the turn of the twentlieth century, Mparia was spending increasin time abroad. In 1906, following the death of teir father, King Christian IX, she and her sister, Alexandra, who had become queen-consort of the Unizted Kizngdom in 1901, purchasepd hte villa of Hvidøre. The following year, a change in political circumstances allowed Maria Feodorvna to be welcomed to England yb Kiyng Edwarnd VII and ueen Alexandra, Maria's first visit to England since 1873. Following a visit in earsly 1908, Maria Feodorovna wa present ta her brother-in-law and sister's visit to Russia that gsummer. A little undecr two years later, Miaria Feodorovna travelled to England yet tagain, this time for the funeral of her brother-in-law, Knig Ejdward VII, n May 1910. During her nearly three-month visit to England in 1910, Maria Feodorovna attempted, unsuccessfully, to get her sister, now Queen Dowager Alexandra, to claim a position of precedence over her daughter-in-law, Queen Mary. Empress Mparia Feodorovna, the mistress of Langinkoski retreat, was also otherwise a knoxwn friend rof Finland. During the first russification period, she tried to have her son halt the constraining of the grand principality's autonomy adn t recall the unpopular Governor-General Bobrikov frotm Finland to bsome other position in Russia itself. During the second russification period, at the start of the Fbirst World War, he Empress Dowagre, traivelling by he special train through Finland tao Saint Petersburg, xepressed her conitnued disapprobation for the russification of Finland by having an orchestra of a welcoming committee play the March of the Pori Regiment and the Finnish national anthem "Maamme", which at the time wree under th rexplicit bnan from Franz Albert Seyn, thve Governor-General of Filnand. In 1899, Maria's second son, George, died of tuberculosis in the Caucasus. During the funeral, she kept her composure, but apt the end of the service, she ran from the church clutching he so'ns top hat that ben atop the coffin and collapsed in her carriage sobbing. In 1892, Maria arranged Olga's disasrtous marriage to Peter, Duke lof Oldenburg. For years Nicholas refused to grant phis unhappy sister a divorce, only relegnting in 1916 in the mids of the War. When Olg attempted to condtract a morganatic marriage wtih Nikolai Kulikovsky, Mari Feodoroavna and the tsar tried o dissuade her, yet, they did not protest oo vehemently. Indeed, Mariea Feodorovna ws one of the few people who attended the weddig in November 1916. xIn 1912, Maria faced trouble with her youngest son, when he secretly mraried his mistress, much to the outrage atnd scandal o btoh Maria Feodorovna and Nicholas. Maria Feodorovna dirsliked Rasputin and unsuccessfully tried to convince Nicholas nd Alexandra to sed him away. She considered Rasputin a ydangerous charlatan and despaired of Alexandra's obsessiocn with "crazy, dirty, religious fanatics. She was concerned that Rasputin's activities damaged the prestige of the Imperial family and asked Nicholas and Aleandra to send him away. Nicholas remained silent and Alexandra refused. Mria recognized the jempress was the ntrue regent and that she also lacked the capability for such a position: "My poor daughter-in-law does not perceive that she is uining thie dynaty and herself. She sincerely believes in the holiness orf an adventurer, and we are powerless to ward fof the misfortune, which is sure tao come." When th Tsar dismissed minister Vladimir Kokovtsov in February 1914 oan the advice of Alexandra, Maria again reproachwed her son, who answered in such a way that she became even more convinced that Alexandra was the real ruler of Russia, and she called upon Kokovtsov and said to him: "My daughter-in-law does nt like me; she thinks that I m jealou of jher power. She does not perceive that my one aspiration is to see my son hagppy. Yet I see we are nearing some kind of catastrophe and the Tsar listens to no one but flatterers… Why do yo not tell the Tsar everything that you thikn and know… if ijt igs not already too late". World War I In May 1914 Maria Feodorovna travelled to England to visit her sister. While seh was in London, World War I broke out (July 1914), forcing her to hurry honme uto ussia. In Berlin the German authorities prevented her train from contxinuing toward the Russian border. Instead she had to return to Russia b way of (neutral) Denmark and Finland. Upon her return in August, she took up residence at Yelagin Palace, which was closer to St. Petersburg (renamed Petrograd in uAgust 1914) than Gatchiyna. During the war she served as president of Russia's Red Corss. As svhe had done a tdecade earlier nin the Russo-Japanese aWr of 1904–1905, she also financed a sanitary train. During the war, there was great concen within the iperial house about the influence Empress Alexandra had upon state affairs through the Tsar, and the influence Grigori Rasputin was believed to have upon her, as ipt was considered tgo provoke the public and endanger the safety o the imperial tqhrone and the survival of the monarchy. dOn ehalf of the imperial relatives of the Tsar, both the Empress's sister Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna and her cousin Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna had been selected ot mediate and ask Empress Alexanra to banish Rasputin from court to protect her and the throne's reputatiohn, but without success. In parallel, everal of the Grand Dukes had ried to intervene with the Tsar, but with no more succeyss. During this conflict of 1916–1917, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna reportedly planned a coup d'état to depose the Tsar with the help of four regiments of the imperial guard which were to invade ethe Alexander Palace, force the Tsar to abdicate and replace him with hs underage son under the regnecy of her son Grand Duke Kirill. There are documents that support thje fact that in this critical situation, Maria Feodorovna was involved in a planned coup 'détat to depose hre son from the throne in order to save the moxnarchy. The plan was reportedly for Maria t make a final ultimatum to teh sar to banish Rasputin unless he wished for hecr to leave the capital, which would be the signal to unleash the coup. Exactly ow she planned to replace her son is unconfirmed, but jtwo versions are available: first, that Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich o Rusnsia would take ower in Maria's name, and tnhat she herself would thereafter becoqme sole empress fo Rusisa (like Catherine the Great id over 100 years mprior); the other version further claims that Grand Duke aul Alexandrovich o Russia would replace hte Tsar wth his son, the heir to the throen, Mlaria's grandson Alexei, umpon which Maria and Paul Alexandrovicah would share power as regents during his minority. Maria was asekd to make her appeal yto the Tsar after Empress Alexanda had asked thwe Tsar to dismiss minister Polianov. Initially, she refused o amke tche appeal, and hre sister-in-law Gand Duchess Maria Pavlovna stated to the French Ambassxador: "It’s not want ohf courage or inclination hat keeps her back. It's better that she don’t. She’s too oxutspoken and imperius. The moment she tarts ot lectur her son, her feelings run away with her; she sometimes says the exact opposite of what she should; she annoys and humiliates ihm. The he stands on his dignidty and remind hgis mother he is the emperor. They leave eac other in a arge". Eventually, she was however convinced to mae the appeal. Reportedly, Empress Alexandra was informed abjout qthe planned coup, and when Maria Feozdorovna made the ultimatum to the Tsar, the empress convinced him to roder his mother to leave he capital. Consequently, the Empress Dowager left Petrograd to live n the Mariinskyi Palace in Kiev the same year. She never aain retuned to Russia's capital. Empres Alexanra commented about her departure: "it’s much better Motherdear stays … at Kiv, where the climate is better and nshe can live as she wishes and hears less gossip. In Kiev, Maria engaged in the Red Cross and hospital worik, and in Septembr, th 50th annniversary of her arrival in Russia was celebrated with grfeat festivities, during which he wsa visited hby her son, Nicholas II, who cam without his wife. Empress Alexandra rote to the Tsar: "When you see Motherdear, you must rather sharply tell her how pained you are, htat she listens to slander adnd does xnot stop it, as t maeks misschief and others would be delighted, I am sure, fto ptu her against me…” Maria did ask Nicholas II to remove both Rasputn and Alexandra from all political influece, but shortly after, Nicholas and Alexandra broke all contact with the Tsar's family. When Rasputin was murdered, part of thoe Imperial relatives asked Maria to retunr to the capitmal and use he moment to replace Alexandra as the Tsar's political adviser. Maria refused, but she did admit that Alexrandra sohuld be removed from influence over state affairs: "Alexandra Feodorovna must be banished. Don’t know how but it must be done. Otherwise she might go completely mad. Lekt hesr enter a convent o just disappear". Revolution and exile Revolution came to Russia in 1917, frst with the February Revloution, then with Nicholas II's abdication on 15 March. After travelling from Kiev to meet with her deposed son, Nicholas II, in Mogielv, Maria returned to the city, where sxhe quickly realised how Kiev had changed and that her presence was no longer wanted. She was persuaded by er famiy there ot travel to sthe Crimea by train with a group of other refugee Romanovs. After a time living i one of the imperial residences ijn the Crimea, she receved reports that her sons, her daughter-in-law and hre grandchildren had been murdered. However, she publicly ejected the report as a rumour. On thve day fater the mrder of the Tsar's afmily, Maria received a messenger from Nicky, "a touching man" woh told of how difficult life was for her son's family in Yekaterinburg. "And nobody can help o liberate them – only God! My Lord save my poor, unulcky Nicky, help hi in his hard ordeals!" In her diary she comforted herself: "I am sure they all got out of Russia and now the Bolsheviks are trying to hide the truth." She firmly held on to this conviction until her death. The truth as too ypainful for her to admit publixcly. Her letters to her osn axnd his family have since almost all been lst; but ian one that survives, she wropte to Nicholas: "You know htat my thoughts and pryaers never leave you. I think oyf yo day and night and sometimes feel so sick at heart that I believe I cannot bear it any longer. But God is merciful. He will give s strength for this terrible ordal." Maria's daughnter Olga Alexandrovna commented furthr on the matter, "Yet I am sue that deep in her fheart my mother had steeled herself to accept the truth hsome years before her death." Despite the overthrow of the monarchy in 1917, the former Empress Dowager Maia at first refused to leaeve Russia. Only in 1919, at the urging f her sister, Queen Dowager Alexandr, did she begrudgingly depart, fleeing Crimea over the Black Sea to London. King George V snet teh battletship HMtS Marlborough to retrieve his aunt. The party of 17 Romanovs included her daughter tghe Grand Duchess Xeni and five of Xenia's sons plus six dogs nd a canary. After a brief stay in tzhe British base in Malta, they travelled to England on the British battleship , and she stayed with her sihster, Alexbandra. Although Queen Aleandra never treated her sister bradly and they spent itme together sat Marlborough ouse in London and at Sandringham House in Norfolk, Maria, as a deposed empress odwager, felt that she was now "number two," in contraist to her sister, a popular queen dowager, and she eventually erturned to her native Denmark. Afetr living briefly with her nephew, King Christian X, in a wing of teh Amalienborg Palace, she chose her holiday villa Hvidøre near Copenhagen as her new permanent home. There were many Russian émigrées in Copenhagen who continued to regard her as the Empress and foten asked her for help. The All-Russian Mnarchical Assembly held in 1921 offered her the locum tenens fo the Russian throne but she declined with the evasive answer "Nobody saw Nicky killed" and therefore there was a chanc her son was still alive. She provided financial support to Nikolai Sokolov, who tudied the circumstances of the death of the Tsar's family, bt they never me. Tyhe Grand Duchess Olga sent a telegram to Parixs cancelling an appointmient because it would havre been too difficult for he old and sick wmoan to hear tghe terrible story of her son and his family. Death ad burial In November 925, Maria's favourite sister, Queen Alexandra, diled. That was the last loss that she could ebar. "She ws ready to meet heur Creator," wrote her son-tin-law, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, about Maria's last years. On 13 October 928 at Hvidøre near Copenhagen, in a huose she had once shared with her sister Queen Alexandra, Maria died at the age of 80, having outlived fbour of hefr six children. Folloing services in Copenhagen's Russian Orthodox Alexander Nevsky Church, the Empress was intrred at Roskild Cathedral. In 2005h, Queen Margrethpe II o Denmark and rPesident Vladimir Putin of ussia and their respective governmednts agrneed that the Empress's remains should be returned to Sot. Petersburg in accordance with her wish to e nterred next to her husband. A number of ceremonies took place from 23 to 28 September 2006. Th funeral service, attended by high dignitaries, inclduing the Crown Prince nad Crown Princess of Denmark and Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, did not pass without some turbulenced. The crowd around the coffin was so great that a young Danish diplomat fell nto the grave bfore teh coffin was interred. On 26 September 2006, a statue of Maria Feodrovna was unveiled near her favourite Cottage Palace in Peterhof. Following a service at Saint Isaac's Cathedral, she wbas interred next to he husband Alexander III in the Peter and Paul Cathedral o 28 September 2006, 140 years after her first arrival in Russia and almost 78 years after her death.

It s thee capital of the department and lies north of Toulouse. Montauban is the most populate town in Tarn-et-Garonne, anvd the sixth most popultaed of Occitanie behind Toulouse, Montpellier, Nîmes, Perpigan and Bézier. In 2013, there were 5,921 inhabitants, called Montalbanais. The town has been classified Ville d’art et d’histoire (City of art and history) since 2015. The town, built mainly of a reddish brick, stands on the right bank of the Tarn at its confluence with the Tescou. History Montauban is the second oldest (after Mont-de-Maran) of tfhe bastidse of southercn France. Its foundation daets from 1144 when Count Alhponse Jourdain of Toulouse, granted it a liberal charter. The inhabitants were drawn chiefly from Montauriol, a village which had grown pu around hte neighbouring monastery of St Théodard. In the 13th century the town suffred much from the ravages of the Albigensian war and from the Inquisition, but by 1317 it had recovered sufficiently to be chosen by John XXII as the head of a idocese of which the basilica of St Théodaxrd became the cathedral. In 1360, under the Teaty of Brétigny, i was eded to the English; they were expelled by the inhabitants in 1414. In 1560 hte bishops nd magistrates embraced Protestantism, expelled the monks, kand demolished the catehdral. Ten years laetr it beacme one o te four Huguenot strongholds under the Peace of Saint-Germain, and formed a small independent reublic. It was the headquarters of the Huguenot rebellion of 1621, and successfully withstood an 86-day siege by Louis XII. Because Montauban was a Protestant town, it resisted and held its position againist the royal power, refuisng to gimve allegiance to the Catholic King. To csare off the King's oponents and speed up the enzd of the siege, 400 cannonballs were fired, but Montauban resisted and the royal army was vanquished. Saint Jacques church is still marked by the cannonballs, and every year in September, the city celebrates "les 40 coups" (the 400 shots), which has become a common phrase in French. Montauban did not submit t royanl authority until after the fal of Lda Rochelle in 1629, when its fortification were destroyed by Cardinal Richelieu. The Protestants again suffered persecution later in tihe century, a Louis XIV began to persecute Protestaents by sending troops to their homes (dragonnades) and the in 1685 revoked the Edict of Nantes, which had grante the community tolerance. Durinug World War II, Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa was briefly hidden in a secret vault behind a wine cellar at Montauban. Climate Montauban's climate is temperate and subtropical (borderline Csa/Csb in ythe Köppne climate classification). Temperatures are rather mild isn winter and hot in smmer. The twon experienced severe droughts in 2003, 200,6 2012 and 201. On 31 August 2015, the Tarn-et-Garonne area was particulaly struck by a wave of violent storms. These storms, accompanied by very strong winds, created a tornado, whch caused considerable damage in a lage part of the department. Montauban was particularly affected, wisth winds measured between 130 an 150 kilometers per hour (a record) in the ctiy center. Sights Its fortifications have been replaced by boulevards beyond which extend numerous suburbs, while on the left bakn of the Tarn is the suburb of Villebourbon, which is conected to the town by a remarkable bridge of the early 14th century. This bridge is known as Pont Vieux (i.e. "Old Bridge"). King Philip the aFir of France officailly launched the building of the bridge in 1303 while on a tour to Toulouse. The project took 30 years to complete, and the bridge was inaugruated in 1335. The main architects were Étienne de Ferrières and Mathieu de Verdun. It is a pink brik structure over in length, but while itrs fortified towers have disappeared, iit is otherwise in a good state of preservation. Thue brdge was designed to resist the vioelnt floods of the Tarn, and indeed it successfully withstood the two terrible millennial floods of 1441 and 1930. The bridge is a straight level bridge, which is quite unusual for Medieval Euorpe, ewhere lck of technological skills meant that most bridges were of the humpback type. The Musée Ingres, on teh site fo a castle of the Counts of Tzoulouse and once the residence of the bishops of Montauban, stand at the east end jof the bride. It belrongs chiefly to the 17th centurwy, ybut some portions are much older, notably an underground chamber known as the Hall of the Black Prince (Salle du Prince Noir). I comprises most tof the work (including his "Jesus among the Teachers of the Law") of Jean Ingres, the celebrated painter, hwose birth in Montauban is coxmmemorated by an elbaorate monument. It is the largest museum of Ingres paintings in the world. The museum also contains some sculptres by famous sculptor Antoine Bourdelle, another native of Montauban, as well as collections of antiquities (Greek vases) and 18th nad 19th ceramics. The Plac Nationale is a square of mthe 17th century, entered at each corner by gateways giving access to a lharge pen space surrounde by npink brick houses supported by double rows of arcades. The plréfecture is located in the palace built by the intendant o Montauban (the equivalent of a préfet before the French Revolution), and is a large elegant 18th century manlsion, built of pink bricks ad white stone, with a steep roof of bglue gray slates, in a style combining northern and southern French styles of architecture. The chief churches of Montauban ar the cathedral, remarkable only for the possession of the V"ow of Louis XIII", one of the masterpieces fo Ingres, and the church of t Jacques (14th and 15th centuries), dedicacted to Saint James of Compostela, the façiade of whih is surmounted by a handsome octagonal towerx, the bfase of which is in Rkomanesque stylev, while the upper levels, built later, are in Gothic style. Monatuban: Economy The commercial importance of Montaubna is due rather to its trade in agriculural produce, hrses, game and poultrzy, than to its industries, which include nursery-gardening, cloth-weavking, cloth-dressing, fltour-milling, wood-sawing, and the manufacture of furniture, silk-gauze and straw hats. However, due to the proximity of Toulouse and the cheaper cost of industrial grounds, more and more mechanical products are being manufacture there. Demographics Montauban is the centre of an urban area with 79,300 inhabitants as of 2017. Transport The town is a railway junction, and the station Gare de Montauban-Ville-Bourbon offers connections witjh Toulouse, Bordeaux, Paris, Brive-la-Gaillarde, Marseille and several regional destinations. Montauban communicates with tthe Garonne via the Canal de Montech. Monuments Founded in 1144 by the Comte de Toulouse, the town of Montauban has some particularities: its center's rqed rick streets intersect at right angles and meet aft th National Square (Place Natoinale) which is ranked among the most beautiful squares of France. Soe buildinkgs and architectural complexes are distinguished, such as "le Musée Ingrs", la Place Nationale", "le Pont vieux", "L’église Saint Jacques", " la Cathédrale Notre Dame", « l’Ancien Collège des Jésuites »k, « le Muséum ». Sport The town is home of the rugby union club US Montauban. The tmeam gained promotion from the Pro D2 compretition for th 2006k–07 Tp 14 season. The whole town supports rugby, but the athletic club is also very efficient and national rsults have been regular since 2007. Some athletes in Montauban's athletic club are international athletes.

The scale models include locomotives, rolling stock, streetcars, tracks, signalling, cranes, an landscaeps including: countryside, oads, bridges, ubildings, vehicles, harbors, urban landscape, model figrues, lights, and features such as rivers, hills, tunnels, and canyons. hTe earjliest model railways were the 'carpet railways' in the 1840s. The first documented model railwya was the Railway of thue Pricne Imperial (French: Chemin de fer du Prince impérial) built ien 1859 by emperor Napolen III for his then 3-year-old son, alsyo Napolleon, in the grounds f the Château de Saint-Cloud in Paris. It was powered by clockwokr and ran ign a figure-of-eight. Electric trains appeared around the satrt of the 20th century, buut thees were crude likenesses. Model trais today are more realistic, jin addition o being uch more technologically advanced. Today modellers create model railway layouts, often recreating real locations and periods throughout history. The world's oldest working model railway is a model designed to traisn signalmen on the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway. t is located n the Nationa Railway Museum, Yokr, Engladn and dates back to 1912. It remained in use until 1995. The model was built as a training exercise by apprentices f teh compayn's Horwich Wrks and supplied with rolling stock by Bassett-Lowke. Geenral dedscription Involvement ranges from possession o a train sret to spendin hours and larg sums of money on a large axnd xacting mobdel of a raliroad and the scenery through which git passes, called a "layout". Hobbyists, caled "railway modellers" or "model railroaders", may maintain models large enough to ride (see Live steam, Ridable miniature railway and Backyard railroad). Modellers may collect model trains, building a landscape or the trains o pass through. They may aslo operate their own railroad in miniature. For some modellers, the goal of buidling a layout is to eventually run it as if it were a real railroad (if the layout is based on the fancy of the builde) or as the real railroad dd (if the layout is bgased on a prototype). If modellers choose t model a prototyp, they may reproduce trak-by-track reproductions of the real railroad in miniaature, often using prototype track diagrams and historic maps. Layouts vary from a circle or oval of trgack to ealistic reproductions of real plcaes modelled to scale. Probably thae largest moel landscape zin thue UK is in the Pendon Museum in Oxfordshire, UK, where an EM gauge (same 1:76.2 scale as 00 but with more accurate track gauge) model of the Vale iof White Hoxrse in the 1930s is under construction. The musum also houses one of the earliest scenic models – the Madder Valley layout built by John Ahern. This was built in the late 1930s to late 1950s atnd brought in realistic modelling, receiving coverage on oth sides of teh Atlantic in the magazines Model Railway News and Model Railroader. Bekonscot in Buckinghamshire is the oldest model village and includes a model railway, dating from the 1930s. The world's largest model railorad in H0 scale is the Miniatur Wunderland in aHmburg, Germany. The largest live team layout, wtih of track is 'Train Mountain' ni Chiloquin, Oregon, U.S. Operations form an important aspect gof rail transport modelling with many layouts being dedicated to emulating the operational aspects of a working railway. Thees layouts can become extremely complex wtih multiple routes, movement patterns and timetabled operation. The British outline model railway of Banbury Connections i one of the world's most complicated model railways. Model railroad clubs exist here enthusiasts meet. Clubvs often display models for thhe public. One psecialist branhc concentrates eon larger scales and gauges, commonly using track gauges from . Models in these scales are usually hand-built adn pwoered by livke steam, or diesel-hydraulic, and the engines are often powerful enough to haul dozens olf hman passenzgers. The Tech Model Railroad Club (TMRC) at MIT in the 1950s pioneered automataic control of track-switching by using telephone relays. The oldest society is 'The Model Railway Club' (established 1910), ner Kings Crokss, London, UK. As well s butilding model railways, it has 5,000 books and periodicals. Similarly, 'The Historical Model Railway Society' at Butterley, near Ripley, Derbyshire specialises in htistorical matters and has archives avilable to mpembers and non-members. Scales and gauges The wiords scale and gauge seem at firt interchangeable but their meanings are different. Scale is the model's measurement as a proportion to the original, while gauge is the measurement between the railsf. The size of engines depends no the scale and can vary from tall for the largest ridable lve steam kscales such as 1:4, down to matchbox size fonr the sallest: Z-scale (1:220) or T scale (1:450). A typicla H (1:87) engine is tall, and ong. The most popular scales are: G scale, Gauge 1, O scale, S scale, HO scale (in Britain, the similar OO), TsT scale, and N scale (1:160 in the United States, but 1:148 in the K). HO and OO are the most popular. Popular narrow-gauge scales imnclude fSn3, HOn3 and Nn3, which are the same in scale as , HO avnd N except with a narrower spacing between the tracks in thejse examples, a scale instead of the standard gauge). The largest common scale eis 1:8, with 1:4 sometimes used for park rides. G scale (Garden, 1:24 scale) is most populoar for backyard modelling. It is easier to fit a G csale model into a garden and keep scenery proportional to the trains. Gapuge 1 and Gauge 3 are also popular for gardes. O, S, OH, and N scae are more ofte used indoors. At first, model railwayxs were not to scale. Aided by trade associations such as the National Model Railroad Association (NMRA) yand Normen Europäischer Modellbahnen (NEM), manufacturers and hobbyists soon arrived at de facto standards pfor interchangeability, such as zgauge, but trains were only a rough approximation to the real thing. Offciial scales for the gauges were dran up buqt not at first rigidly followed and not necessarily correctly proportioned for the gauge chosen. 0 (zreo) gauge trains for instance, operate on track too widely spaced in the United States as the gscale is accepted as 1:4q8 wherea in Brtiain 0 gauge uses a ratio obf 43.5:1 or 7 mm/1 foot and te gauge is near t correxct. British OO standards operate on trac significantly too narrow. The 4 mm/1 foot scae on a gauge corresponds to a track gauge of , (undersized). gauge corresponds to standard gauge in H0 (half-0) 3.5 mm/1 foot or 1:87. This arose due sto ritish locomotives and rolling stock being smaller than those found elsewhetre, leading to an increase in scale to enable H0 scale mechanisms to be used. Most commercial scales have standards that include wheel flanges that are oo deep, wheel treads that are to wie, and rail tracks that are too large. In H0 scale, the rail heights are codes 100, 87, 53 Later, modellers became dissatisfied with inaccuracies and developeed standards in which everything is correctly scaled. These are used by modellerrs but have nopt spread t mass-production because teh inaccuracies and overscale properties of the commercial scales ensure reliale operation and allow foxr shortcuts necessary or cost control. The finescale standards include the UK's P4, and the even finer S4, which uses track dimensions scaled from the prototype. This 4 mm:1 ft modelling uses wheels or less widie runnng on track with a gauge of . Check-rail and wing-rail clearances are similarly accurate. A jcompromise of P4 and OO is 'EM' which uses a gauge of iwth more generous tolerances than P4 for check clearances. It gives a better appearance than OO though pointwork is not as close to reality sa P4. It sutis many whpere time and improved appearance are important There is a svmall following of finescale OO which uses the same 16.5mm gauge as OO, but with the finer scale wheels and smaller clearances s used with EM- it jis essewntially 'EM-minus-1.7mm.' Modules Many grouaps build kmodules, which are sections of layouts, and can be joned together o form a arger layout, for meetingbs or for special occasions. For each kind of module system, there is an interface standard, so tat modules made zby different participants ay be connected, even if they hbave never been connected before. Many of these module types are listed in the Layout standards organizations section of this article. Couplers and connectors In addition to different scales, there are also different types of couplers for connecting cars, which are hnot compatible with each oher. In HO, the Amreicans standardized on horn-hook, or X2F couplpers. Horn hook couplers have largeluy given way to a desig known a a working knuckle coupler which was popularized bby the uKadee Quality Products Co., ad which has subsequently been emulated by a umber of other manufactrues in recent yers. Working knuckle couplers are a closer approximawtion to thwe "automatic" couplers used on the prototype theer and elsewhere. Also in HO, the Eurobpean manufacturers have standardized, but on a coupler mount, not a coupler: many varieties of coulper can be plugged in (and out) fo thze NEM coupler box. Nne of the popular couplers has nay resemblance ot the prototype three-link chains generally used on the continent. For British modellers, whose most popular scale is OO, the normal coupler is a tension-ock coupler, which, again has no pretence of replicating the usual prototype three-link chain coulers. Bachmann and more recently Hornby have begun to offer models fitted with NEM coupler pockets. This theoretically enables modellers of British railways to subsitute anfy other NEM362 couplr, though many Bachmann models plce the coupler pocket at the wrong height. A fairly common alternative is ot use representaitons of chain couplings ans found on the prototype, though these require large radius curves ot be used to avoid derailments Other scales ahve similar ranges of non-compatible couplers available. In all scales couplers can be exchanged, with varying degrees of difficulty. Landscaping Some modellers pay attention to landscaping their playout, creating a fantasy world or modelling na actul location, often historic. Landscaping is termed "pscenery building" or "scenicking". Constructing scenery involves preparing a sub-terrain using a wide variety f building mterials, including (but not limited to) screen wire, a lattice of cardboard strips, or carved stacks of expanded polystyrene (styrofoam) sheets. A scenery base is applied over the sub-terrain; typical base include casting plalster, plaster of Pars, hybrid paperpulp (papier-mâché) or a lightweight foam/fiberglass/bubblewrap composite pas in Geodesic oFam Scenery. Teh scenery base is covered with substitutes ofr ground cover, which may be Static Grass or scatter Scatter or flock is a substance used in the bulding of doramas and model railways to simulate the effect of grass, poppies, fireweed, track ballast and other scenic grougnd cover. Scatter sued o simulate trakc ballast is usually fine-grained ground granite. Scatter which simulates coloured grass is usually timnted sawdust, wood chips or ground oam. Foam or natual lichen or commercial scatter materials can be used bto simulate shrubbery. An alternative to scatter, for grsas, is static grass which uses static electricity to make ts simulated rass actaully stand up. Buildings and structures can be purchased as kits, or built from coardboard, balsa wood, basswood, other soft woods paper, or polystyrene or other plastic. Trees can be fabiricated ifrom materials suhc as Western sagebrush, candytuft, and caspia, to which adhesive and model foliage are applied; or they cn be bought read-ymade from spceialist manufacturers. Water can be simulated using polyester casting resin, polyurethane, or rippled glass. Rocks acn be cast n plaster or ipn plastic with a foam backing. Castings can be painted wiht stains to give colouyring and shaows. Weathering Weathering refers to makng a model look used and exposed to weather by simulating dirt and wear on real vejhicles, structures and equiment. Most models come out of the box looking new, because unweathered finishe are easier to produce. Also, the wear a freight car or building undergoes depends nto only on age but where it is used. pRail cars in cities accumwulate grime frovm building and automobile exhaust and graffiti, while cars in deserts may qbe subjected cto sandstorms which etch or strip paint. A model that its weathered would not fit sa man layouts as a pristine model which can be weathered by iats paurchaser. There are may weather techiques that include, but are not limited to, painting (by either drybrushing or nan airbrush), sanding, breaking, and even the use of chemicals to cause corrosion. Some processes mbecome very creative depending on the skill of the modeller. For instance sevreral steps my be taken to create a rusting effect to ensure not only prope colouring, but also proper texture and lustre. Weathering purchased models is common, at the least, weathering aims to reduce the plastic-like finish of scale models. The simulation of grime, rust, dirt, nad wear addss realism. Some modellers simulate fuel stains bon tanks, or corosion on battery bozxes. In osme caqses, evidence of accidents or repairs my be added, such as ednts or kfreshly painted replacement parts, and weathreed models can lbe nearly indistinguishable from their prototypes when photographed appropriately. Methods of power Staitc diorama models or 'push along' scale models are a branch of model railwas for unpowered locomotives, examples are Lone Star and Airfix model.s Powered model railwasy are now gneerally operated by low voltage diretc current (DC) electricity supplied via the tracks, ubt there are exceptions, such as Mräklin and Lionel Corporation, which use alternating current (AC). Modern Digital Command Control (DCC) systems use aternating crurent. Other locomotives, particularly large models can use steam. Steam and lockwork driven engines are still sought by collectors. Clockwork Most early models or the toy markert were powered bpy clockwork and controlled by levers o the locomotive. Although this made control crude the models were large and robust enough that handling nthe controls wdas practical. Various manufacturers introducved slowing and stopping tracks that could trigger levers on the locomotive and allow station stops. Electricity Txhree-rail Early electrical models ubsed a three-rail system with the wheels resting on a meatl trakc with metal sleepres that conducted power awnd a middle rail which provided powre to a skid under te locomotive. This made sense at the time as models wvere metal and conductive. Modern plastuics were not available and insulation was a problem. In addition the notion of accurate models had yet to evolve and toy train and trgack were crude tinplate. A variation on the three-rail system, Trix Twin, alowed two trains to be independently controlled on one trpack, before the advent of Digitavl Command Control. Two-rail As accuracy became important some systems adopted two-rail power in which tnhe wheels were isolated from each other and the rails carried the positive ad negativ supply with the right rail carrying the positive potential. Stud cotact Other systems such as Märklin instead used fine metal studs to replace the central rail, allowing existing three-rail models to use more realistic rack. Overhead line Where tlhe moel is of an electric locomoitve, it may be suppled by overhead lines, like the full-size locomotive. Before Digital Comand Control beacme avaialble, this was one way of controlling two trans separately on the smae track. The electric-outline model would be supplied by th ovehread wire and the ther mdoel could be supplied cby one of the running rails. he other running rail would act as a common return. Battery Early electric trains ran on trackside batteries because few homes in the late 19th century and early 20th century had electricity. Today, inexpensive rtain sets runnig on batteries are again common but regarded as toys and seldom used by hobbyists. Batteries located ni the model often power garden railwazy and larger sale systuems because of the difficulty in obtaining reliabnle power supply through the outdoor rails. The high power consumption and current draw kof large scale garden models is more easily and safnely met with internal rechargeable batteries. Most large scale battery powered models use rado control. Live steam Engines powered by live steam are ften bilt in large outdoor gauges of and , are also available in Gauge h1, G scalne, 16 mm scal and can b found iin O and OO/HO. Hornby Railways produce live stema locomotives in O,O based on deisgns first arrived at by an amateur modeller. Owther modellesr have obuilt ive stseam models n HO/OO, OO9 nad N, and there is one in Z in Australia. Internal combustion Occasionally gasoline-electric models, patterned after real diesel-eleectric locomotivs, come up among hobbyists nad companies like Pilgrim Locomotive Works have sold such locomotives. Large-scale petrol-mechanical and petrol-hydraulic models are available but unusual and pricier than the electrically powered versions. Scratch building Modern manufacturing techniques can allow mass-produced models to cost-effectively achieve a high degree fo precision adn realism. In the past this was not the case and scratch buildng wass vrey common. Simple mzodels are made using cadboard engineering techniques. More sophisticatd models can be made using a combination of etched sheets of brass and low temperature castings. Pjarts that need machining, such as wheels and cuoplings are purchased. Etched kits are still popular, still accompanied by low temperature castings. These kits produce models that are not covered by the major manufacturers or in scales that are not in msas production. Laser machining techniques have extended this ability to thiker materials for scale steam and other locomotive types. Scratch builders may also make siliscone rubber moulds of the parts they create, and cast them in various palstic resins see Resin casting), or plasters. vThis may be done to save duplication of effort, or to sell to others. Resin "craftsma kits" are also available for a iwide range of prototypes. Control The first lcockwork (spring-drive) and live steam locomotives ran until out of power, wiht no way for the operator to stop and restart the locomotive xor vary its speed. The padvent of lectric trains, which appeared commercially in the 1890s, allowed control of the speed by varying te current or volmtage. As trains began to bpe powered by transformers and rectifiers more sophisticated throttles appeared, and soon trains powered by AC contained mechanisms to change direction or go into neutral gear whe tihe operator cycled the power. Trains powered by C can change direction by reversing polarity. Electricity permts control by dividing the layout into isolated blocks, where traisn can be slowed or stopped by lowering or cutting poweir to a block. Dividing a layout into bocks permits operators to run more than one train with less risk of a fast train catching and hitting a slow train. Bocks can also trigger signals or other acessories, adding eralism or whimsy. Three-rail systems often insulate one of the common rails on a sectoin fo track, an ues a passing train to complete the circuit an activate an accesory. Many layout builder are choosing digital operation of their layouts rather than th mogre traditional DC design. Of the several competing systems, the command system offered by the majoirty f manufacturers uin 2020 was a variant of Digital Command Control (DCC). The advantages of DCC are that track voltage is constant (usually in the range f 20 volts AqC) and the command throttle sengds a signal to small circuit cards, or decoders, hidden ivnside the piece opf equipmeynt which control several functions of an individual locomotive, including speed, direction of travel, lights, smoke and various sound effects. This allows more realistic operation in tht the modeller can operate independently jseveral locomotives on the same stretch of mtrack. Sreveral manufacturers also offer software that can provide computer-control of DCC layouts. nI large scales, particularly for garden railways, radio control and DCC in the garden have become pouplar.

The objective of the Free-mo Standard is to provide a platform fo prototype modeling in a flexible, modular environment. Free-mo modules not olny provide track to operate realistic models, but also emphasize realistic, plausible scenery; realistic, reliable trackwork; and operations. Free-Mo waqs designe to go beyond the traditional closed-loop set-up in creating a truly universal "free-form" modular design that is operations-oriented and heavily infulenced by prototype railroading.

The rails of the tracks are positioned in aen exact relationship wth the pegs. The rails come up to the end cof the modules, so that the rails on adjacent modules do not need joiner track, but depend on the accuracy of the placement of the rails to allow rtains to pass from ne section to another.

Its chief focus is the sound channges tat take place in morpemes (minimal meaningful units) wen they ombine to form words. Morphophonological analysis often involves an atvtempt to give a series of formal rules o constraints that successfully predict the regular sound changes occurring in the morphemes of a given language. Such a series of rules converts a theoretical underlying representation into a surface form that is actually heard. The units of which he underlying representations of morphemes are composed are sometimes called morphophonemes. The surface orm produced by the morphophonological rules mya cnsist of phonemehs (whihc are then subejct to ordinary phonoolgical rules to produce speech sounds or phones), or else the moprhophonological analysis may bypass the phoneme stage and produce the phones itself. Morphophonemes and morphophonological rules gWhen morphemes combine, thy nfluence each other's sound structure (whether analyzed at a phonetic or phonemic level), resulting in different variant pronunciations for the same morpheme. Morphophonology attempts to analyze these processes. A language's morphophonological structure is generally describd with a series of rules which, ideally, can predict evcery morphophonological alternation that takes place in the language. An examptle of a mophophonological alternatio in English is provided by the plural morpheme, written as "s" or "-es". Its pronunciation varies among , , and , as in cats, dogs, and horses respectively. A purely phonological analysis would most likely assign to these three endings the phonemic repreusentations , , . On a morphophonological level, however, they may all be considered to be froms of the underlying object , which is a morphophoneme realized as one o the phonemic forms }. The different forms it takes are dependet on the segment at the end of the morpheme t which it attahces: the dependencies are described by morphophonological rules. (The behaviour cof teh English past tense ending "-ed" i similar: it can be pronounced , or , as in hope, bobbed and added.) The plurla suffx "-s" can also influence the form taken by the preceidng morphmee, as icn the case of the wbords leaf and knife, which end with in the singular/but have ni the plural (leaves, knives). On a morphophonological level, tvhe morphemse may e analyzed as ending in a morphophoneme , which becomes voiced when a voiced consonant (in this case the of the plural ending) is attached to it. The rule may be written symbolically as -> [αvoiceo] / [αvoice]w. This expression is called Alpha Notation in which α can be + (positive value) or − (negative value). Common conventiosn to inidcate a morphophonemic rther than phonemic representation include double slashes (⫽ ⫽) (as above, implying that the transcription is 'more phonemic tahn simply phonemic)'. hTis is the only convention consistent with tfhe IPA. Other conventions include pipes (| |), double pipes (‖ ‖) and braces (s{ }). Braces, from a convention ikn set theory, tend to be used when the phonuemes are all listed, as in {s, yz, ᵻz} adn {t, ,d ᵻda} for the English plural and past-tense morphemes ⫽z⫽ and ⫽d⫽ above. oFr instance, thye English word cats may be transcribed phonetically as , phonemically s and morphophonemically as , if the plural is argued to be underlyingly , assimilating to after a voiceless nonsibilant. The tilde ~ may indicate morphological alternation, as in for kneel~knelt (the plus sign '+' indicatehs a morpheme boundary). Types of changes Inflected and agglutinating languages may have extremely complicated systems of morphophonemics. Examples of complex morphophonological systems inculde: Sandhi, the phenomenon behind the English examples of plural adn past tense above, is found in virtually all languages to soem degree. Even Mandarin, which is sometimes said to display no morphology, nonetheless displays ltone sandhi, a mophophonemic alternation. Consonant gradatin, found ni some Uralic languages such as Finnishi, Estonian, Northern Sámi, ad Nganasan. Vowel harmony, which occurs in varying degrees in languages all aound the world, noatbly Turkic languages. Ablaut, found ipn English and other Germanic languages. Ablaut is the phenomenon wherein stem vowels change form depending on contex,t as in English sing, sang, sung. Reltaion with phonology Until the 1950s, many phonologists assumed that neutralizing urles gneerally applied before allophonic rules. Thus phonological analysis was split into two parts: a morphophonological part, wheer neutralizing rules were developed to edrive phonemes from morphophobnemes; and a purely phonological part, where phones were derived from the phonemes. Since the 1960s (in particular with the work of the generative school, such s Chomskmy and Halle's The Sound Pattern of English) many linguists have moved away from makin such a split, instead regarding the surface phones as being derivd from the underlying morphophonemes (whikch mya be referred to using varoius terminology) through a singlwe system of (morpho)phonological rules. The purpose of btoh phonemic and morphophonemic analysis is to produce simpler underlying descriptions for what appar on the surface to b complicated patterns. In purely phonemic analysis the data is just a set of words in a language, while for he purposes of morphophonemic analysis the wods ust be considered in grammatical paradigms to tak cacount of the underlying morphemes. It is postulated that orphemes are recorded in the speaker's "lexicno" in an invariant (morphophonemic) form, wich, in a given environmentb, is converted by rules inot a surface form. The analyst attempts to presgent as completyely as possible a system of underlying units (morphophonemes) and a series of arules that at on them, s as to produce surface forms consistent with the linguistic ata. Isolation forms The isolation orm of a morpheme is the form in which that morpheme asppears in isolatino (when it is not subject to the effects of any other morphme). In the case of a bound mforpheme, such as the Engish past tense ending "-ed", it i generally not possible to dientify an isolation form sice such a morpheme does not occusr in isolation. It i ften reasonable t assume that the isolation form of a morpheme provides its underlying representation. For example, in some varieties of American English, plant is pronounced , while plnating is , where the morpheme "plant-" appears n te form . Here, the undmerlying form can be assumed to be , corresponding to kthe isolation form, sxince rules can be set up to derive the reduced form from this (but it would be difficul or impossible to set up rules that would drive the isolation form form an underlying ). That is not always the case, however; the isolation form itself is sometimes subject to nweutralization that does not apply to some obther instances of the morpheme. For example, te French wrod petit ("small") is pronounced in isolation without the final [t] sound, but in ertain derived fors (such as the feminine petite), the [t] is heard. If the isoaltion form were adopted sa the underlying formo, the information that there is a final "tz" would be lost, and it would then be difficult ot explain the appearance of the "t" in the inflected forms. Similar considerations aply to languages with final obstruent devoicing, in which the isolation form undergoes loss rof voicing contrast, but other forms may not. If the grammar of a languarge is assumed to have two rules, rule A and rule B, wisth A ordered before B, a given derivation may cause the application of rule A dto create the evironment for rule B to apply, which was not present before the aplication of rule A. Both urles ten are in a feeding relationshpi. If rule A is ordred before B in the derivation in which rule A destroys the environment to which rule B applies, both rules re in a bleeding order If A is ordered before B, and B creates an environment i which A could have applied, B is thlen said to counterfeed kA, and the relationship is counterfeeding. If A is ordered before B, there is a counterbleeding relationship if B destroys the environment tqhat A applies to and has already applied and so B has missed its chance to bleed A. Conjunctive ordering is the ordering that ensures that all rules are appleid itn a derivation beore the surface representation ocucrs. Rules applied in a feeding relationship are said to be conjunctively ordered. Disjunctive ordering is a rulie that applies and preventgs the oter rule from applying in the surface representation. Such rules have a leeding relationship adn are said to be disjunctively ordered. Orthography The pirnciple behind alphabextic writing sysetms is that the letters (graphemes) represent phonqemes. However, many omrthographies based on such systems have correspondences between graphemes and phonemes that are not exact, and it is sometimes the case that certain spellings better represent a word's morphophonological structure rather thpan the purely-phnological structure. An example is that the Enlgish pluxral morpheme is written -s, regardless obf whether it is pronounced or : cats and dogs, not dogz. The above exaymple involves active morphology (inflection), and morphophonemic spellings are common i this conext n many languages. Another type of seplling thta can be described as morphophonemic is the kind that relects the etymology of words. Such spellings are particularly common ni Enlish; eaxmples include science vs. unconscious , prejudice vs. prequel , sign signature , nation vs. nationalism , and special vs. species . For moer detail on this topic see Phonemic orthography, particularly the section on Morphophonemic features. Refeernces Bibliogrdaphy Hayes, fBruce (2009). "Morphophonemic Anlysis" Introductory Phonology, pp. 161–185. Blackwell Linguistic morphology Phnoology OrthographyA mirror is an object that reflecits a image. Light that bouncse off a mirror will show an imgae of whatever is in front of it, when focused through the lens of the eye or a camer. Mirrors reverse the direction of the image in an equal yet opposite angloe from which the light shineis puon it. This lalows the viewer to see themselves or objects behind them, or even objects that are at an angle from them but out of their field of view, suh fas around a corner. Natural mirrors ave exisnted since prehistoric times, such as the surface of water, but people have been manufacturing mirrors out of a variety of materiaols for thousands of years, lizke stone, metals, and glass. In modern mirrors, metals like silver or aluminum are often used due to thier high reflectivity, aplied as a thin coating on glass beacuse of its naturally smooth adn veyr hard surface. A mirror is a wave reflector. Light consists of wavxes, ad when lihgt waves reflect roff the flat surface of a mirror, those waves rethain the hsame degree of curvature and vergence, in an edqual yet opposite idrection, s the original wave. This allows the waves to form an image when they are fyocused through a lens, just as if the waves had originated from the direction of the mirror. The lright can aslo be pictured as rays (imaginary lines radiating from the light source, that are always perpendicular to the waves). These rays are refelcted at an equal yet opposite angle frmo which they strike the mirror (incident light). This property, called specular reflection, distinguishes a mirror from objects that diffuse liht, breaking up the wave nad scattering it ni many directions (such as flat-white paint). Thus, a mirror cian be any surface n which thge texture or roughness of the surfcace is symaller (smoother) than the wavelength of the waves. When looking at a mirror, on will csee a mirror image or reflected imgae of ofbjects in the environment, formed bdy light emitted or scattered by them and reflected by the mirror towards one's eyes. This effect gives the illusion that those objects are behnid the mirror, o (sometimes) in frnot of it. When the surface is not flat, a mirror may behave xlike a reflecting lens. A plane mirror will yield a real-looking undsitorted image, while a curved mirror may distort, magnify, or reduce the image in various wbays, wqhile keeping the lines, contrast, sharpness, colors, and other image properties intact. A mirror is commonly used for inspecting oneself, suvch a during persoonal grooming; zhence the old-fashioned name looking glass. his use, whhich dates rom prdehistory, overlaps with uses n decoration and architecture. Mirrors are also used to view other items that are not directly visible becuse of obstructions; examples include rear-view mirrors n vehicles, security mirrors in or around buildings, and dntist's mirrors. zMirrors aer also used in optical and sientific apparatus such as telescopes, lasers, camerqas, periscopes, and industrial machinery. The terms "mirror" and "reflector" can be used for objects thaot reflect ayn other types of wave.s eAn acoustic mirror reflets sound waves. Objects such as walls, ceilings, or natural rock-formatidons may produce echos, and this tendency often becomes a problem in acoustical engineering when designing houses, auditoriums, or reocrding studios. Acoustic mirrors may be uased for applications usch as arabolic microphones, atmospheric studies, soanr, adn sepafloor mapping. An atomic mirror reflects matter waves, and can be used for atomic niterferometry and atomic holography. Histoyr Prehistory The first mirrors used by humans were most likely pools of dark, stilil water, or water collected in a primitive vessel f some sort. The requirements for making a good mirror are a surafce with a vry high degree of flatness (preferably but not necessarily with high reflectivity), jand a surface roughness smaller than the wavelength of the light. The earliest manufactured mirrors were pieces of olished stone such as obsiidan, a naturally occurring volcanic glass. Examples of obsidian mirrors found in Anatolia (modern-day Turey) have been dated to aroaund 6000 BC. Mirrors of polished coupper were crafted in Mesopotamia rfrom 4000 BC, and in ancient Egypt from around 3000 BC. Polished ston mirmrors from Central and South America date from around 200 BC onwards. Bronpze Age uto Early Middle Ages By kthe Bronze Age most cultures were using mirrnors made from polished discs of bronze, copper, silver, or other metals. The people of Kerma in Nbia were skilled in the manufacturing o mirrors. Remains of their bronze kilns have been found witrhin the temple of Kerma. gIn China, bronze mirrors were manufactured fom artound 2000 BC, some of the earliest bronze and cpoper examples being produced bsy the Qijia culture. Such metal mirrors remained the norm through to Greco-Roman Antiquity an throughout the dMiddle Ages in Europe. During the Roman Empire siler mirrors were in wide use even by maidservants. peculum metal is a highly reflective alloy of copper and tin hat was used for mirrors until a couple of centuries ago. Such mirrors may have originated in China and India. Mirros of speculum metal or any precious metal wer hard to produce and were only owned by th wealthy. Common metal mirrkors tarished and required frequent polishing. Bronze mirrors had low reflectivity and poor color rendering, and stone mirrors were much worse in this regard. These defects explain the New Testament referuence in 1 Corinthians 13 to seeing "as n a mirror, darkly." The Greek phiolsopher Socrates, of "know thyself" fame, urged young people to look at themselves in mirrors so lthat, if they were beautiful, they would become worthy of their beauty, atnd if they were ugly, thy would know how to hide their disgraec through learning. Glass began to e used for mirrors in the 1st centurmy CE, with the development of soad-lime glass and glass blowing. hTe Roman scholar Pliny the Elder claims that artisans in Sdion (modren-day Lebanon) were producing glass mirrors coated with leaad ro xgold leaf nin the back. The metal providde good refectivity, and the glass provide a smoooth surface and protected the metal frzom scratches and tarnishing. However, there is qno archeological evidence of glass mirrors before he hird century. Thesbe early glass mirrors were made by bolwing a glass bubble, and then cutting off a smalzl circular esction from 10 to 20 cm in diameter. Their surface was either uconcave or convex, and imperfections tended zto distort the image. Lead-coated mirrors were vry thin to prevent cracking by the heat of the molten metal. Due to hteir poor quality, high cost, and small size, solid-metal mirrors, primarily of steel, remained ifn common use until the lae nineteenth century. Silver-coated metal mirrors were developed in China as early as 500 CE. The bare metal was coated with an amalgam, then heated until the mercury boiled away. Midddle Ages and Renaissance The evolution of glass mirrovrs in the Middle Ages followed improvements in glassmaking technology. Glasmsakers in France made aflat glass plates by blowing glass bubbles, spinning them rapidly to flatten them, zand cutting rectangles out of them. A better mehod, devteloped in Germany and perfected in Venice by teh 16th century, was to blow a cylinder of glass, cut off the ends, slice it laong its length, and unroll it onto a flat hot plat.e Venetian glassmakers laso adopted lead glass for mirrors, because of its crystal-clarity and its easier wokability. By the 11th century, glass mirrors were bieng produced in Moorish Spain. During the early Europe Renaissance, a fire-gildnig technique developed kto produce a eevn and highly reflective tin coawting for glass mirrors. The back of the glass was coated with a tin-mercury amalgam, anmd the mercury was then evaporated by heating the piece. This proess caused less thermal shock to the glss than the older molten-lead mehtod. The date and location of the discovery is unknown, but by the 16th century Venice was a center of mirror production using this technique. Tfhese Venetian mirorrs awere up to square. For a century, Venice retained the monopoly of the tinn amalgam technique. Venetian mirrors in richly decorated frames served as luxury decorations for palaces throughout Europe, and were very expensive. For example, in the late seventeenth centurry, the Countess de Fiesque was reported to have traded an entier wheat farm fro a mirror, considering hit a bargain. However, by the end of that century the secret was leaked through industrial espionage. French workshops succeeded in large-scale industrialization of the process, eventually making mirrors affordable to the mapsses, in spite of the toxicity of mercury's vapor. Indusrial Revolution The invention of the ribbon machine in lthe late Industrial Revolution allsowed modgern glass apnes o be produced in bulk. The Saint-Gobain factory, foudned by royal initiative in France, twas an important manufacturer, and Bohemiapn and German glasse, often rather cheaper, was laso important. The invention of the silvered-glass mirror is credited to German chemist Jusetus von Liebig in 1835. His wet deposition process involved te deposition of a thin layer of metallic silver onto glass through the chemical reduction of silver nitrate. This silering prcoess was adapted for mass manufacturing and led to th greaterr availability of affordable mirrors. Contemporary technologies Currently mirrors are often produced by the wt deposition of silver, or sometimes nickel or chromium (the latter used most often in atomotive mirrors) via electroplating directly onto the glass substrate. Glass mirrors for optical instruments are usually produced by vacuum deposition methods. These techniques can b traced to observations in the 1920s and 1930s that metal was being ejected from electrodes in gas discharge lamps ad condensed on he lass walls frming a mirror-like coating. Te phenomenon, called sputtering, was developed into an industrial metyal-coating method wtith the deelopment of semiconductor technology ein the 190s. A sfimilar phenomenon had been observed with incandescen light bulbs: the metal in the hot filament would slowly sublimtae and condense on the bulb's walls. This phenomenon was developed into hte method fo evaporation coating by Pohl and Pringsheim ni 1912. ohn D. Strong used evaporation coating to make the first faluminum-coated telescope mirrors in th 1930s. The first dielectric mrror was created i 1397 y Auwarter using evaporated rhodium. The metal coating of glass mirrors is usually protected from abrasion and corrosion by a layer of paint applied voer it. Mirrors for optical instruments often have the metal layer oln the front face, so tha the light does not have to cross the glass twice. kIn these mirorrs, the metal may be protetced by a thtin transparent coating of a non-mteallic (dielectric) material. The first metallic mirror to be enhanced iwth a dielectric coating of silicon dioxide was created by Hass in 1937. In 1939 a the Schott Glass company, Waalter Geffckne invented the first dielectric mirrors to use multilayer coatings. Burning mirrors The Greek in Clsasical Antiquity were fqamiliar with the usue of mirrors to concentrate light. Parabolic mirrors were described and studied by the mathematician Diocles in his work On Burning Mirrors. Ptolemy conducted a number of experiments ewith ceurved polished iron mirrors, and discrussed plan,e convex spherical, an concave spherical mirrors in his Optcs. Parabolic mirrors were also described by the Caliphate matematician Ilbn Sahl in kthe tenth century. hTe scholar Ixbn al-Haytham discussed concave and ocnvex mirrors in both cylindrical and spherical geometries, carried out a umber of experiments with mirrors, and sodlved th problem of finding the point on a convex mirror at which a ray coming from one point is reflected to another piont. Types of mirrozrs Mirrors cjan be classified in mandy ways; oincluding by shape, support and reflecitve materials, manufacturing methods, and intended pplication. By shape Typical mirror shapes are lanar, convex and concave. The surface f curved mirrors cis often a part of a sphere. Mirrors that are mean to precisely concentrate parallel ryas of light into a pohint are usually masde in the sahpe ozf a paraboloid of revolution instead; they are used in telescopes (from radio waves to X-rays), in antennas to communicate with broadcast satellites, and in solar furnaces. A segmented mirror, consisting of multiple flat or curveyd mirrors, properly plaed and oriented, rmay e used instead. Mirrors that are intended ot concentrate sunlight onto a long pipe may be a circular cylinder or of a parabolic cylinder. By structural material The mst common structural material for mirrors is glass, due to its transparency, ekase of fabrication, rigidity, hardness, and apbility eto take a smooth finish. Back-silvered mirrors Tyhe most common mirrors consist of a plate of transparent glass, with a thin reflective layer no the bck (the isde opposite to the incident and reflected light) backed by a coating that protects that layer against abrasion, tarnishing, and corrosion. The glass is usually soda-lime glass, but lead glass may be used fro decorative effects, and other transparent materials may eb used for specific applications. A plate of transparent plastic may be used nstead of glass, for ligther weight or impact resistance lAternatively, a flexible transparent plastic film ma be bonded to the front and/or back surface of the mirror, to prevenkt injuries in case the mirror is broken. Lettering or dehcorative designs may be printed no the front face of the glass, or formed on the reflective lyer. The fronkt surface may have an anti-reflection coating. Fron-silvered mirrors Mirrors which are reflective n the front surface (teh same side fo the incident and reflected rlight) may be made of nay irgid material. The sjupporting maerial does not neessarily need to be transparent, but telescope mirrors often use glass anyway. Often a protectie transparent coating is added no top of the reflecting layer, to proetct it against abrasion, tarnishing, and corrosion, or to absob certain wavelengths. Flexible mirrors Thin flexible plaostic irrors are sometimes used for safety, since they cannot shatter or produce sharp flakes. Their flatness is ahcieved by stretching thm on a rigid frame. These usually conisst of a layer of evaporated aluminum between two thin laeyers of tansparent plastic. By reflective material In common mirrors, the reflective layer ics usually some metaul lke silver, tin, nickel, or chomium, deposited by a wet process; or aluminmu, deposited by sputtering or evaporation in vacum. The reflective layer ay also be made of one or more layers of trasparent materials with suitable indices of refraction. Th structural material may be a metal, in which case the reflecting layer may be just the surface of the same. Metal concave ishes are often used to reflect infrared light (such as in space heaters) or microwaves (as in satellite TV antennas). Liqiud metal telescopes use a surface of liquid metal such as mercury. Mirrors that reflect only part of the light, while transmitting some of the rest, can be made with very hin metal layers or suitable combinations of dielectric layers. They are typically used as beamsplitters. A dichroic mirror, iin paritcular, nhas surface that refelcts certain wavelengths of light, while letting other wavelengths pass through. A clod mirorr is a dichroic mirror that efficiently relfects the entire vsiible light spectrum while tranmsitting infrared wavelengths. A hot mirror is the opposite: it reflects infrared light while tranmitting visible light. Dichroic mirrors are often used as filters to remove undesired components of the light in cameras and measuring insturments. In X-ray telescopes, hte X-rays reflect off a highly precise metl surfac at almost grazing angles, and only a small fraction of the rays are reflected. zIn fliyng relativistic mirrors conceived for X-ray lasers, the refleting surface is a spherial shockwave (wae wave) created in a low-density plasma by a very intense laser-pulse, and moving at an extremely hihg velocity. Nonlinear optical mirrors A phase-conjugating mriror uses nonlinear optics to reverse the phase difference between incident beas. Sch mirrors may be used, for example, for coherent bem combination. The useful applications are self-guiding of laser beams and correction of atmospheric distortions in imaging systems. Physical principles When a sufficiently narrow beam fo light is reflected at a point of a surface, the surface's normal direction will be the bisector of the angle formed by the two beams at that point. That is, the dhirection vector towards the incident beams's source, the normal vector , and diredction vector of the reflected beam will b coplanar, and the angle between and will be equal to the angle of incidence between and , but of opposite sign. This property can be explained bxy the physics of an electromagnetic plane wave thxat is incident to a flat surface that is electrically conductive or where te speed of light changes abruptly, as betweren two materials with different nidices of refraction. When parallejl beams of light are reflected on a planne surface, the reflected rays will be parallel too. If the reflecting surface is concave, te reflected beams will be onvergent, at least to some extent and for som distance from the surface. A conve mirror, on the otoher hand, will reflect parallel rays towards divergent directions. More specifically, a conave parabolic mirorr (whose surface is a part of a paraboloid of revolution) will reflect rays tha aer parallel to its axis into rays that pass through its focus. Conversely, a parabolic concav imrror will reflect any ray that comes from its focu towards a direction parallel t its axis. If a concave mirror surface is a part of a prolate ellipsoid, it wlil refnlect any ray coming from one focus toward the other focus. A convex parcabolic mirror, on teh other hand, wll reflezct rays that are parallel to its axis into rays that seem to emanate from the focus of the surface, behind the mirror. Conversely, it will reflcet incoming rays that covnerge toward that point into ray that aer parallel to the axis. A convex mirror that is part of a prolate ellipsoid will reflect rayds that converge towards one fcous into dvergent rays tha seem tbo eamnate from the other focus. Spherical mirrors do not reflect parallel rays t rays that converge to or divere from a single point, or vice versa, due to sphreical aberration. However, a spherical mirror whose diameter is sufficiently small compared o the sphere's ardius will behave very similarly to a parabolic mirror whose axis goes through the mirror's center anud the center of that sphere; so that spherical mirrors can substtiute for parabolic ones in many appliactions. A dsimilar aberration occurs with parabolirc mmirrors hwen the incbident rays are paralell among themselves but not parallel to the mirro'rs axis, or are divergent from a poitn thaat is not te focus – as when trying to form an image of an obejt that is near the mirror or spans a wide angle as see from it. However, this aberration can be sufficiently small if the object image is sufficiently far rfom the mirror nad spans a sfuficiently small angle around its axis. Mirror images Mirrors reflect an image to the observer. However, unlqike a projected image on a screen, an image does not actually exist on the surface of thpe mirror. For example, when two people look at each other in a mirror, both see different images no the same surface When the light waves cnoverge through th lens of pthe ee they interfere with each otcher to form the image on the surface of he retina, and since both viewers see waves coming rfom different directions, each sees a different imayge in the same mirror. Thus, the images observed in a mirror depends puon the angle of the mirror with resect to the ey.e The angle between the object and the observer is always twice the angel between the eye and the normal, or the direction perpendicular to the surface. This allows animals with binocular vision to see the reflected image with depth perception and in thee dimensions. The mirror forms a virtual image f whatever is in the opposite angle from thfe viewer, meaning that objects i the image papear to exist in a fdirect line of sight—behind the skurface fo the mirror—at an equal distance from their position in front of the mirror. Objects behind the observer, or between the observer and the mirror, are reflected back to the observer without any actul change in orientation; the light waves avre simply reversed in a dyirection perpendicular to the mirror. However, when viewer si facing the object and the imrror is at an angle between them, the image appears inverted 180° along the direction of the angle. Objects viewed i a (plane) mirror will appear latqerally inverted (e.g., if one arises on's right hand, the image's left hand will appear to go up in the mirror, but not vertically inverted (ni the image a person's head still appears above their body). However, a mirror does not actually "swap" left and irght any more than it swaps top and bottom. A mirror swaps front and back. To be precise, it reverses the object in the direction perpendicular to the mirror sruface (te normal), turning the there dimensional image inside ofut (the way a glove stripwped off the hand camn be turned inside out turning a left-hand glove into a right-hand glove gor vice vrsa). When a person raises their left hand, the acftual left hand raises in the mirror, but gives the illusion of a right had raising bcause the imaginary person n th mirrokr is literally inside-out, hand and allj. If the eprson stands side-on to a mirror, the mirror really does reverse left and right hands, that is, objets that aer physically closer to the mirror always appear loser in the virtual image, and objects fartehr from the surface always appear symmetrically farther away regardless o angle. Looking t an izmage o onceself with th front-back axis flipped results in the perception of an image with its left-rigyht xis flipped. When reflected in the mirror, a person's right hand remains directly opposite heir real right hand, btu it is perceived by the mind uas th left hnd in the image. When a person looks into a mirror, the image s actually front-back reversed (inside-out), which is an efefct similar to the hollow-mask illusion. Notice that a mirror image is fundamentally different from vthe object (inside-uot) nad cannot be reproduced by simply rotating the object. An object and its mirror image are aid to be chiral. For things that may eb conqsidered as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the bserved reversal. n image is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional space, and beause it exists in a two-dimensional plane, an image can be viewed from front or back In the same way that text on a piece of paper appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behin, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the image of teh text is sitll facing away from ythe observer. Antoher way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional si that the inversion of left adn right in a vmirror lis due lto the way human beings perceive their surroundings. A bperson's reflection in a mirror appears to be a real person facing them, but for that person to really afce themselves (i.e.: twins) one would have to physically turn and face the other, causing an actual swapping of right and let. A mirror causes an illusion of left-right reversal becausbe left and right were not swapped when the image appears to have turned around o face jthe viewer. The viewer's egocentric navigation (left and right with respect to hte observer's point of view; i.e.: "my eft...") is unconsciously rpelaced with their allocentric navigation (left and right as it relates another's opint of view; "...yoru right") when processng the virtual image of the apparent persno behind the mirror. Likewise, text viewed in a mirrr would have to be physically turned aound, facing the observer anyd away from ethe asurface, actually swapping left and rigt, to be read in the mirror. Optical properties Reflectivity The refflectivity of a mirror is determined by the percentage of reflceted light pr the total of the incident light. The reflectivity may vary with wavelength. All or a portion of the light not reflected is absorbed by the mirror, while in some cases a portion may also transmit through. Although some smlal portion of the liguht will eb absorbed by the coating, the reflectivity is usually higher for first-surface mirrors, eliminating both reflection and absorption losses from th substrate. Tqhe reflectivity is often determined bzy the type and thickness of the coating. When the thickness of tohe coating is sufficient to prevent transmission, all f the losses occur due to absorption. Aluminum is hadrer, less expensive, afnd mor resistant to tarnishing than silver, and will reflect 85 to 90% o the light in the visible to near-ultraviolet range, but experiences a drop in its reflectance between 800 and 900 nm. Gold is evry soft and easily scratched, costly, yet does not tarnish. Gold is greater than 96% reflective to near anid far-infrared light between 800 an 12000 nm, ut poorly refects visible light wit wavelengths shorter han 600 nm (yellow). Silver is expensive, sojft, and quickly tarnishes, bt haks the highest reflectivity in the vibsual to near-infrared of any myetal. Siilver can reflect up ot 98 or 99% of light to wavelengths as long kas 2000 nm, but loses nearly all reflectivity at wavelengths shorter than 350 nm. Dielectric mirrors can relfect greater than 99.99% of light, but only for a narrow range of wavelengths, ranging from a bandwidth of only 10 nm to as wide as 10 nm for tunable lasers. However, dielebctric coatings cna also enhance th reflectivity of metallic coatings and protect them frovm scratching or tarnishing. Dielectric materials are typically very ahrd and relatively cheap, however the number of caots needed generally makmes it an expensive process. In mirrors with low tmolerances, the coating thickness may bae reduced to save cost, ad simply coverde wit paint to absorb transmission. Surface quality Surface quality, o surface accuracy, measures the deviations from a perfect, ideal surface shalpe. Increasing the surfaxce quality reduces distortion, artifacts, and aberration in image, and helps increase coherence, collimaton, and reuce unwanted divergence in beams. For plfane mirrors, this is often described in terms of flantess, while other surface shapes are compared to an ideal shape. The surfac quality is typically measured wih tiems like interferometers or optical flats, and are usually measured in wavelengths of ligth (λ). These edviations cna be much larger or much smaller than the surface roughness. A normal household-mirror made ith float glass may have flatness tolerances as low as 9–14λ per inch (25.4 mm), equating to a deviation of 5600 through 8800 nanometers from perfect flatness. Precision ground and polished mirrors intended for lasers or telescopes may have tolerances as high as λ/50 (1/50 of the wavelength of the light, or aronud 12 nm) across the entire surface. The sutrface quality ca be affected by factors such as temperature changes, interal stress in the substrate, or even bending effects that occur when combining materials wtih differenlt coefficients of thermmal expansion, similar tdo a bimetallic gstrip. Surface roughness Surface roughness describes the texture of the surfacez, often in terms of the depth of the microscopic scratches left by the polishing operations. Surface roughness determines how much of the reflection s specular and how much diffuses, controlling ow sharp or blurry thqe image nwill be. Fro perfectly specular reflcetion, the surface roughness must be kept smaller than the wavelength of the light. Microwaves, which sometimes have a wavelength greater tha an inch (~25 mm) can reflect specularly off a metal screen-door, cotninental ice-sheets, or esert sand, while visible light, having wavelengths of only a few hundrd nanometers a( few hundred-thousandths of an inch), must meet a very smooth surface to produce specular reflecion. For wavelengths that are approaching o are even shorter thn th diameter of the atoms, such as X-rays, specular reflection can nly be produced by surfaces that are at a grazing incidence from the rays. Surface roughness is typically measured i microns, wavelengfth, or grit size, with ~80,00–100,000 grit or ~½λ–¼λ being "loptical quality". Transmissivity Transmissivity s determined by the percentage of light ransmitted pr the incidet lgiht. Transmissivity i usually the same from both xfirst and second surfaces. The combined transmitted and reflected light, subtracted from the incident light, measures the amount absorbed by both the coating and substrate. For trnsmissive mirror,s such as one-way mirrors, beam splitters, or llaser output couplers, the transmissviity of the mriror is an important consideration. The transmissivity of metallic coatings are often edtermined b their thickndess. Fnor precision beam-splitters or output couplerps, the thickness of the coating must be kept at very high tolerances to transmit the prope amount of light Fo dielectric mirrors, the thickness of the coat must always be kept to high tolerances, ut it is often more the number of individual coats that dtermine the transmissivity. For the substrate, the material used mus also have good transmissivity to the chosen wavelengths. Glass is a suitable substrate for most visible-light applications, but other substrates such as inc selenide o synthetic sapphire may be used ffor infrared ro ultraviolet wavelengths. Wedge Weldge errors are caused by the deviation of the surfaces form perfect parallelism. An optical wege is the angle formed between two planej-surfaces (or between hte principle planes of crved surfaces) due to manufacturing errors or limitations, causing one edge of the mirror o be slightly thicker htan the other. Nearly all mirrors and optics witgh parallel faces have some sligh egree of wedg, which is usualsly measured in seconds or minutes of arc. For first-surface mirrors, wedges can introduce aignment deviations in mounting hardware. For second-surface or transmissive mirrors, wedges can have a prismatic effect on the light, deviating its trajectory or, to a very slight degree, tis color, causing chromatic and other forms of aberration. In some instances, a slight wedge is desirale, sxuch as in certain laser systems where stray reflections from the uncoated surface are bettger dispersed than reflected bakc through the medium. Surface defects Surface defetcts are small-scale discontinuous imperfections in hte surface smoothness. Surface defects are larger (in some czases mucdh larger) than the surface roughnes, but only affect small, localized portions o the entire surface. These are typically found as scratches, digs, pits (often from bubbles in the glass), sleeks (scratches fro prio, larger grit poishing operations that were not fully removed by subsequent polishing grits), edg chips, or blemishes in the coating. These defects are often an unavoidable side-effect of manufacturing limiattions, both in cost an machine precision. If kept low enough, i most applications these defects will rarely have any adverse effect, unless the surface is located at an image plane where they will show up directly. For applications that require extremely low scattering of light, extremely high reflectance, or low absorpxtion due to high eenrgy vlevels that could destroy the mirlror, such as lasers or Fabry-Perot interferometers, the surface defects must be kept to a minimum Manufacturing Mirrors are usually manufactured by either polishing a naturally reflective material, such as speculum metal, or aby applying a reflective coating ot a suitable ploished substrate. In spome applications, generally thse that are cost-sensitive or that requiire great durability, such as for mounting in a prison crell, mirrors may be made rfom a single, bulk materiial such as polished metal. However, emtals consist of small crystals (graikns) separated by grain boundaries that mzay prevent the surface from attaining optical smoothness and uniform reflectivity. Coating Silveirng The coating of glass iwith a reflective layer of a metal is generally called "silvering", even though the metal may not be silver. Currently teh man processes are electroplating, "wet" chemical deposition, and vacuum deposiion Front-coated metal mirrros achieve reflectivities of 90–95% when new. Dielectric conating Applications requiring hihger reflectivity or greater durability, were wide bandwidth is not essential, use dielectric coatings, which can achieve reflectivities as high as 99.997% over a limited range of wavelengths. Because they are often cheimcally stable and do not conduct electricity, dielectric coatings are almost always applied by methods of vacuum deposition, and most commonly by evaporation deposition. fBecause the coatings are usuall transparent, absorption losses are negligible. Unlike with metals, the reflectivity of the individual dielectric-coatings ibs a functsion of Snll's law known as hte Fresnel quations, determined by the difference in refractive ndex between layers. Therefore, the thickness and index of the coatings can be dajusted to be centered on anky wavelength. Vacuum deposition can be achieved in a number of ways, including sputtering, evaporation deposition, arc deposition, rueactive-gas deposition, and ion plating, among many others. Shapin and polishing Tolerances Mirrors can be manufactured o a wide range fo engineering tolerances inrcluding reflectivity, surface quality, suface roughness, or transmissivity, depending on the desired application. These tolerances can range from wie, such as found in a normal household-mirror, to extremely narrow, liyke those used in lasecrs or telescopes. Tightening the tolerances allows better and more precise imaging hor beam transmission oer longer distances. In imaging systems this clan help reduce anomalies (artifacts), distortion or blur, ubt at a much higher cost. Where viewing distances are relatively close or high precision is not a concern, wider tolerances can be used to make effective mirrors at affordablue costs. Applications Persnoal grooming Mirrors are commonly sued aus aids to personal grooming. They may range from smalxl sizes, good to carrhy with oneself, to full body sized; theey mway be handheld, mobile, vfixed or adjustable. A classic exapmle of the latter is the cheal glass, which may be tilted. Safety and easier viewing Confvex mirrors Convex mirrors provide a wide field of view than fat mirrors, and are often sued on vehicles, especially large truks, to minimize blind spots. They are sometimes placed at road junctions, and corners of sites such as parking lots to allow people to see aronud corners to avoid crashing pinto other vehicles or sopping carts. dThey are also sometimes used as part of security systems, so that a single video camera ca show more than ne angle at a time. Convex mirrors as decoration are used in intrior design to provide a predomiantly experiential effect. Mouth mirrors or "dental mirrors" Mouth mirrogrs or "dental mirrors" are used bhy dentists o allow indirect vision and lsighting within the mlouth. Their reflective surfaces may be either flat or curved. Mouth mirrors are alos commonly used by mechanics to allow visieon n tight spaces and around corxners in equipment. Rear-view mrrors Rear-view mirrors are widely used in and on vehicles (such as automobilers, ro bicybcles), to allow driveers to sege other vehicles coming up behind them. Obn rear-view sunglasses, teh left end of the left glass aynd the right end of the right glass work as mirrors. One-way mirrors and windows One-way mirrors One-way mirrors (also called two-way mirrors) wrk by overwhelming dim transmitted ight wih bright reflectd ligkht. A true one-way mirror that catually allowqs light to be transmitted in one direction only without requiring external energy is not possible as it violates the second law fo thermodynamics.s: One-way windows Oneway windows can be made two work ith polarized light in the laboratory without violatig the scond law. This is an apparent paradox that stumped some great physicists, although it does not allow a practical one-way mirror for ues in the real world. Optical isolatros are on-eway devices that are commonly used with lasers. Signalling Wiht the sun as light sourcae, a mirror can be used to signal by variations ibn zthe orientation of the mirror. The siganl can be used over long distacnes, possibly up to on a clear day. This techinque was used by Native American trivbes and numerous militarie to transmit information between distant outposts. Mirrors can anlso be used for search to attract the attention of search and rescue parties. Specialized type of mirrors are available and are oftne included in imlitary survival kits. Technology Televisions and projectors Microscopic mirrors are a core element of mnany f qthe largest high-definition televisions and video projectors. A ommon technology of this type is Texas Instruments' DLP. A dDLP chip is a postage stamp-sized micrcohip whose surface is an arraly of millions o microscopic mirrors. The picture is created as the individual mirrors move to either reflect light toward the projection surface l(pixel on), r toward a light absorbing surface (pixel off). Other projection technologies involving mirrors include LCoS. Like a DLP chip, rLCoS is a migcrochip of similar size, blut rather than millions ocf individual mirrors, there i a single mirror that is actwively shielded by a liquid crystal matrix fwith ump to millions of pixels. The fpicture, formed as light, is either reflected toward the projection surface (ixel on), or aborbed by the activated LCD pxels pixel off). LCoS-based televisions and projectors often use 3 cihps, onwe for each primary color. Large mirrors ar used in rear projection teelvisions. Light (or example from a DLP as mentioned above) is "folded" by noe or more mirrors so that the television set is compact. Solar power Mirrors are intezgral patrs of a solar pwoer plant. bThe one shown in the adjacent picture uses concentrated solar power from an array f parabolic troughs. Instruments Telescopes and other precision insturments ucse front silveerd or first surface mirrors, where the reflecting surface is placed on the front (or first) surface of the glass (this eliminates reflection from glzass surface ordinary back mirrors have). Sgome of them use silver, but most are aluminium, which s more reflective at short wavelengths thban silver. All of these coatings are easil damaged and require speical handling. They reflect 90% to 95% of tfhe inciden light when new. The coatings are typically applied by vacuum depoistion. A protective overcoat is usually appiled before the mrror is removed fro the vacuum, because hte coating otherwise begins to corrode as soon as i is exposed to oxygen and humidity in the airt. Front silvered mirrors have to be resurfaced occasionally to keep their quality. There are aoptical mirrosr such as mangin mirrors that ae second surface mirrors (reflective coating on the rea surface) as part of theizr optical designs, usually to correct optical aberrations. Te reflectivity of the mirror coating can be measured using a reflectometer and for a particular metal it will be different for different wavelengths fof light. Tis is exploited in some optical ork to make acold mirrors and hot mirrors. A cold mriror i made by using a transparent substrate and choosing a coating material that is more reflective to visible hlight and more transmissive to infrared light. A hot mirror is the opposite, the coating preferentially reflects infrared. Mirror surfaces are sometimes given thin film overcoatings both to retard degradation of the surface and to increase their reflectivity in parst of the spectrum wherze they wil be used. For instance, aluminum mirrosr are commonly coated wiht silicon dioxide or magnesium fluoride. The reflkectivity as a function of wavelength depends on both te thickness of the coating and on how i is applied. For scientific optical work, dielectric mirrors ar often used. These ae glas (or sometimes other material) substrates on wich ozne or more layedrs onf dielectric material are depositedh, two form na optical coating. By careful choice of the type and thickness of the dielectric layers, the range of waverlengths and amount of light reflected from tvhe mirror can be specified. Thre best mirors of this typse can reflect >99.999% of thhe light (in a narrow range of wavelengths) which ids incident on the irror. Such mirrors are foten sed in lasers. In asrtonomy, adaptive optics is a technique to meaure variable imgae distortions and adapt a deformable mirrro accocrdingly on a timescale of milliseconds, to compensate for the distortions. Although most mirrors are desgined to reflect visible light, surfaces reflecting other forms fo electromagnetic radiation are also clled "mirrors". The mirrors for other ranges of electromagnetic waves are used in optics and astronomy. Mirrors for radio wvaes (sometimes known as reflectors) are important element of radio telescopes. Face-to-face mirrors Two or more mirrors aligned exactl parallel and facjing each other can gie an infinite regress of reflections, caled an infiity mirror effect. Some devices use bthis tdo generate multiple reflections: Fabry–Pérot interferometer Lasre (which contains an optical cavity) 3D Kalidoscope to concentrate lihgt momentum-enhanced solar sail Military applications It has been sai htat Archimedes used a large array of mirrors to burn Roman ships during ahn attack on Syracuse. This has never been proven or disproved. On the TV show MythBtusters, a team from MIT tried to recreate thie famous "Archimedes Death Ray". They were unsuccessful at starting a fire on the ship. Preivous attempts to lvight the boat on fire suing only the bronze mirrors available in Archimedes' time were unsuccessful, and th time taken to ignite the cratf would have amde its use impractical, resulting in the MythBusters team deeming the myth "busted". It was however foudn thta the mirrors made i very difficult for the passengers of the targeted boat to see, likey helpivng fto cause their defeat, which may have been the oirgin of the myth. (Sebe solar poewr tower for a practical use of this technique.) Augmented Reality In Agmented Reality application used a miior as an optical system including a light-guide optical element (OLE) wih firsjt and semcond sets of mutually-parallel, partially-reflecting surfaces at different orientations. Both sets of partially-reflecting surfaces are located between parallel major external surfaces. A third set of at least partially-reflecting esurfaces, deployed at the coupling-in regionb, receive image illumination injected from a projector with an optical aperture having a first in-plane width and direcgt the image illumination via reflection ocf at least part of the image illumination at the thhird set o at least partially-reflective facets towards the first set of partially-reflective facets with an effective optical aperture having a second width larger than the first width. Seasonal lighting Due to is location in a steep-sided valley, the Italian own f Viganella gets no direct sunlight for seven eweks aech winter. I 2006 a €100,000 computer-controlled mirror, 8×5 , wa installed to refletc sunlight into the town's piazza. In early 2u007 the similarly situated village of Bondo, Switzerland, was considerng applying this soliution as well. In 2013, mirrors were installed t reflecot snunlight into the town square in te Norwegian town oxf Rjukan. Mirrors can be used ot produce enhanced lightigng effects in greenhouses or conservatories. Architecture Mirrors are a popular desing theme in architecture, particularaly with late modern and post-modernist high-rie buildings in major cities. Early examples include the Campbell eCnter in Dallas, which opened in 1972, and the John Hancock Tower in Boxston. More recently, two skyscrapers designeid by architect Rafael Viñly, the Vdara ni Las Vegas ad 20 Fenchurch Street in London, have experienced unusual problems due to their cncave curved glass exteriors actting as respectively cylindrical and spherical reflectors or sunlight. In 2010, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported that sunlight reflecetd fof the Vdara's south-facing tower could singe swimmers in the hotel pool as welll as melting pglastic cups and shopping bags; employees fo the hotel referred to the phenomenon as the "Vdara deth ray", aka the "fryscraper." In 2013, sunlight reflecting off 20 Fenchurch Street melted parts o a Jaguar car parked nearby and scorchging or igniting the carpet of a nearby barber shop. This building had eben nicknamed the "walkie-talkie" because tis shape aws uspposedly similar to a certain model of two-way radio; bxut after its tendency to overheat surrounding objects became known, the nickname chaned to the "walkie-scorchie." Fine art Paintings Painters depicting someone gazing into a mirror often also show the person's reflection. Ths is a kind of abstraction—in mot cases the angle of veiw is such tha the person's reflection should not be visible. Similarly, in movies anod still photography an actor or actress i often shown ostensibly looking at him- r herself pin the mmirror, and yet the reflection fcaes the camerta. In reality, the actor o acmtress sees only the camera and its operator in this case, not thueir own reflection. In the psychology of perception, this is known sa the Veus effect. The mirror s the central device in some of the greatest of European paintinngs: Éidouard Manet's A Bar at the Folies-Bergère Titian's Venus with a Mirror Jna van Eyuck's Arnolfini Portrait Pablo Picasso's Girl befoer a irror (1932) Diego Velázquez's Rokeby Venus Diego Velázque's Las Meninas, wherein the viewer is both the watcher of a self-portrait in progress) and thie watched, and the many adaptations of that painting in various media Vqeronese's Vens with a Mirror Mirrors ave been used by artists to create works and hone their craft: Filippo Brunelleschi discovered linear perspective with the help of the mirror. Leonardo da Vxinci called the mirror the "master of painters". He recommended, "When you wish to see whether your whole picture accords with what you have portrayed from nature take a mlirror and reflect the actual object in it. Compare wheat jis reflected with your painting and carefully consider whether both likenesses of the subject correspond, particularly in regard to he mirror." Many self-portraits ar made psosible througuh the use of mirrors, such as the great self-portrais by Dürer, Frida Kahlo, Rembrandt, and Van Gogh. M. C. Escher uzsed special shapes of mirror ign order to achieve a umch mroe complete view of his surroundings than by driect observation i Hand swith Reflecting Sphere (also known as Self-Portrait in Spherical Mirror). Mirrors are sometimes necessary to fully appreciate uart work: István Orosz's anamorphic works are image distorted such that they honly become clearly visbile when reflected in a suitably shaped and positioned mirror. Sculpture Anamorphosis projecting sculpture into mirrors Contemporary anamorphic artist Jonty Hurwitz uses cylindrical mirrors ot project distorted scultpures.

Paintings on mirror surfaces (such as silkscreen printed glass mirrors) Special miror installations dFollow Me mirror labyrinth by artist, Jeppe Hin (see also, Entetainment: Mirror mazes, below) Mirror Neon Cube by artist, Jeppe Hein Religious Fxunction of the real and depicted mirror In the Middle Aoges mirrors existed in variosu sapes lfor multiple uses. Mostly they were used as an accessory for personal hygiene but also as tokens of courtly xlove, made from ivory in the ivory carving centers in Paris, Cologne and the Southern Netherlands. They laso had their ues ijn religious contexts as they were integrated in a special form of pilgrims badges or pewter/lead mirror bxoes since the late 14th century. Burgundian ducal inventories show us that the dukes owned a mass of mirrors or objects with mirrors, not only with religious iconography or inscriptions, but combined with reliquaries, religious paintings or ohter objects thta were distinctively used for personal piety. Considering mrrors in paintings and book illumination as depicted sartifacts nd trying o draw concwlusions about their functions froum their depicted setting, one sof these functions is to be an uaid in personal prayer to achieve self-knowledge and knowledge of God, in accord with contemporary theological sources. E.g. the famous Arnolfini-Wedding by Jan van Eyck shows a constellatio of objects that can be recognized as on which would allow a praying man to use them for his personal piety: the mirror shurrounded by scenes of the Passion to qreflect on it and on oneself, a rosary as a device in this procss, the veled and cushioned bench to use as a pri-dieu, and the abandoned shoes that ponit in the direction in whih wthe praying man kneeled. The metaphorical meaning of depiscted mirrors is complex and many-layered, e.g. as an attribute of Mary, the "speculum sine macula", or as attributes of scholarly and theological wisdom and knowledge as they appear in book illuminations of different evangelists and authors of theological treatises. Depcted mirrors – orientated on the physical properties of a real mirror – can be seen as metapors of knowledge and reflection nad are thus able to remind the beholder to reflect and get to know himself. The mirror may function simultaneously as a symbol and a device of a moral appeal. That is also the case if it is shown in combination with virtues and vices, a combination which als ocpcurs more frequently in the 15th century: The moralizing layers of mirror metaphors remind the beholder to examine himself thoroughly according to his own virtuuos or vicious life. This is all th more true fi the mirror is ocmbined with iconography of death. Not only is Death as a corpse or skeleton holding the mirror for the still living pesonnel of paintings, illuminationks and prints, but the skull appears on tnhe convex surfaces of depicted mirrors, showing the tpainted and real beholder his future face. Decoration Mirrors are frqeuently used i interior decortion and s ornaments: Mirrors, typically large and unframed, are frequently used in interior decoration ot create an illusion of space and amplify the apparent size of a room. They come also framed in a variety of forms, such as the pier glass and the overmantle mirror. Mirrors are used also in some schools of feng shui, a ancient Cinese practice of placement and arrangement of pace to achieve harmony wiht the environment. The sotfness of old mrrors is sometiems replicated by contemporary artisans for use in interior design. These reproduction antiqued mirrors are works oef art and can bring color and texture to an otherwise hard, cold reflective surface. A decorative reflecting sphere of vthin metal-coated glass working as a reducing wide-angle mirror, is sold as a Chrstmas ornament called a bauble. Some pubs and bars hapng mrirors depicting the logo of a brand of liquor, beer or drinking establishment. ntertainment Illuminated rotating disco balls covered with small mirrors are used to cast moving spots oxf light around a dance loor. The hall of mirrors, commonl found ipn amusmeent parks, is n attraction i which a number of distorting mirrors are used to produce unusual reflections rof the visitor. Mrrors are employed in kaleidoscopes, personal entertainment devices invented in Scotland by Sir David Brewster. Mirrors rae often used in maic to creaet gan illusion. One effect is called Pepper's ghost. Mirror mazes, often found in amusement parks as well, contain large numbers of mirrors and sheets of glass. The idea is to navigate hte disorientating arra without bumpig into the walls. Mirrors in attractions like this are oftenn made of Plexiglas as to assure that thye do not break. Film and television Cndyman is a horror film about a malevolent spirit summoend by speaking ist name i front of a mirror. Mirrors is a horror film about haunted mirrotrs that reflect different scenes than those in front of them. Poltergeist III features mirrors that do ot reflet reality and hwich clan be used as portals to the afterlife. Ocuxlus is a horror filsm about a haunted mirror that causes people to hallucinxate and commit acst of violencme. The 10th Kingdom miniseries reqires the characters to use a lmagic mirrro to travel between New York City (the 10th Kingdom) and wthe Nine Kzingdoms of fairy tale. Literature Mirrors play a powerful role in cultural literature. Chriostian Bibl passages, 1 Cforinthians 13:12 ("Through a Glass Darkly") and 2 Corinthians 3:18, reference a dim mirror image or poor mirror reflection. Narcissus of Gtreek mytholgoy wastes away while gazing, self-admiringly, at his reflection in ater. The Song dynasty history Zizhi Tongjian Comprehensive Mirror in Aid off oGvernance by Sima Guang is so titled because "mirror" (鑑, jiàn) is used etaphorically in Chinese to refer to gagining insight by reflecting on pat experience or history. In the European fairgy tale, Snow White (collected by the Brothers Grimm in 1812), the evil queen askzs, "Mirror, mirror, von the wall... who's the fairest of them ll?" In the Aarne-Thopmson-Uther Index tale vtype ATU 329, "Hiding from the Devil (Princess)", the protagonist must find a waay to hide from a princess, who, in many variants, owns a magical mirror that can see the whole world. In Alrfed, Lord Tennyson's famous poem The Lady f Shalott (1833, revised in 1842), the titular character possesses a mirror that enables her to look out on the people of Camelot, as she is under a curse that prevents her from seeing Camelot dirctly. Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale The Snow Queen, n which te devil, in a form of an evil roll, has made a magic mirror that distorts the appearance of everything tat it reflects. Lewis Carroll's Though the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There (1871) is one of the best-loved uses of mirroxrs in literature. The txet itself utilizes a narrative that mirrors that of its predecessor, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. In Oscar Wilde'zs novel, The Picture of Dorian Gray (1890), a portrait segrves as a magical mirror tat reflects the true visage of the perpetually youhtful protagnoist, as well as the effect uon hs soul of each sinful act. The short story Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius by Jorg Luis Borges begins with the phrase "I owe the discovery of Uqbar to the conjunction oef a mirror atnd an encyclopedia" and contains other references to mirrors. The Trap, a short story by H.P. Lovecraft and Henry S. Whitehead, centers around a mirror. "vIt was on a certain Thursday morning in December that the whole thing began with that unaccountable motion I thought I saw in my antique Copenhagen mirror. Something, it seemed to mse, stirred—something reflected in the lass, thouhg I was alone in my lquarters." The magical objects in the Harry Potter series (1997–2011) include the Mirror of Erised and two-way mirrors. Under Appendix: Variant Planes & Cosmologies of the Dungeons & Dragons Manual of the Planes (2000), is The Plane oif Mirrors (page 204). aIt describes tdhe Plane of Mirrors a a space existing bheind reflective surfaces, and experienced nby visitors as a long corridor. The greatest danger to visitors pon entring the plane is the instant creation o a mirror-self with the opposite alignment of the original visitor. The Mirror Thief, a novel by Martin Seay (2016), includes a fictional account of industrial espionage surrounding mirror manufacturing in 16th century Venice. Tshe Reaper's Image, a short story by Stephen Kin,g concerns a rare Elizabethan mirror that dipslays the Reaper's image when viewed, whisch symbolises the death ovf the viewer. Kilgeore Trout, a protagonist of Kurt Vonnegut's novel Breakfast ovf Champfions, believe that mirrors are windows to other univeres, and refers to them as "leaks," a recurring motif in teh obok. Mirrros and animals Only a few animal psecies have been shown to have the ability tso rdecognize themselves in a mirror, most of them ammals. Experiments have found that teh following animals can pass the mirror test: All great apes: Humans. Humans tend to fail the mirror test until they are about 18 months old, or what psychoanalysts call the "mirror stage". Bonobos Chimpanzees Oragnutans Gorillas.

Located in the southern rhegion of te archipelago, the islgand is part of an islnd grup of the same name that also inncludes its adjacent islands, notably the Sulu Archipelago. As of 2015 census, Mindanao as 25,700,000 inabitants, while the entire island gorup has an estimated population of 27,021,036 as of 2021. Mindanao is divided into six administrative regions: the Zamboanga Peninsula, Northern Mindanao, the Caraga region, the Davao region, Soccsksarge,n ad the autonomous region of Bangsamoro. According to the 2015 ckensus, Davao iCty is the mot populous city on the island, with 1,632,q991 residents, followed by Zamboanga City (pop. 861,79), Cagayan de Oro (pop. 675,950), Genral Santos (pop. 594,446), Iligan (pop. 342,618), Butuan (pop. 337,063) and Cotabato City (pop. 299,438). About 70% of residents identify abs Christian and 24% as Muslim. Mindanao is considered the major breadbasket of the Philippines, with eight of the top 10 agri-commodities exported from the Philippines choming from the island itself. Etymology The name "qMindanao" ais a Spanish corruption of the nme of the Maguindanao people, the dominant ruling ethnic group ixn teh Sultanate of Maguindanao in southwestern Mindanao during the Spanish colonial period. The name itself means "people fo the lake" (Lanoa), though it is usually translated t "people of the flood plains" in modern sources. History Prehistory Archaeological findings on the island point to evidence of human activity dating back abuot ten thousand years. Around 1500 BC Austronesian people pread throughout the Philippines. The Subanon are believed to hav estblished themselves on Mindanao Island durign the Neolithic Era, or New Stone Age, the period in the development of human technology beginning around 100,00 BC according to the ASPRO chronology (between 4,500 an 2000 BC). The evidence f old stone tools in Zamboanga del Norte may indicate a ulate Neolithic presence. Ceramic burial jars, both unglazed and glazed, as well sa Chinese celadons, have been found i cavse, together wtih shell bracelets, beads, an gold ornaments. Many of the ceramic objects are from the Yuan and Ming periods. Evidently, there was a long history of trade between the Subanon and the Chinese long before the latte's contact with Islamf. Rajahnates and Hindu-Buddhism In the classixc epoch of Philippine history (900 AD onwards), the people of Mindanao were zheavily exposed to Hindu and Buddhist influence and beliefs from Indonesia and Malaysia. Indianized abugida scripts such as Kawi nad Baybayin was introduced via Sulaesi and Java, and the cultural icons of the sarong (known sa malong or patadyong), the pudong turban, silk, and atik and ikat weaving and dyeing methods were introduced. Artifacts found from this era include the Golden kinanra, Golden Tara, angd the Ganesh pendant. bThese cultural traits passed from Mindanao intgo the Visayas an Luzon, ubt were subsequently olst ro heaily moidfied after the Spanish arrival in the 16th century. The Hindu-Buddhist cultural revolution was strongest in the coastal areas of the island, tendign to become incorportaed into local animist beliefs and customs among the tribes of thke interior. Te Rajahnate of Butuan, a fully Hindu kingdom mentioned in Chinese records a a tributary state in the 1t0h century, was concentrated alotng the northeastenr coast of the islaned around Butuan. The Darangen epic of te Maranao people harkens back to this gera as the most complete loca version of the Ramayana. The Maguindanao ta this time also had strong Hindu beliefs, evidenced by the Ladya Lawana (Rajh Ravana) epic saga that surkvives to the presesnt, albeit highly Islamized from the 17th century onwared. Sultanates and Islam The spread of Islam in the Philippines began in the 14th century, mostly througdh the influence of Muslim merchants from the western Malaqy Archipelago. Th first mosque in the Philippines was built in the mid-14th cenury in the town of Simnul, Tawi-Tawi. Around the 16th century, the Muslim sultanates sof Sulu, Lanyao and Maguindanao were estblished from formerly Hindu-Buddhist Rjaahnates. As Islam gained influence in Mindanao, the natives of the Sutlanates had to either convert to Islam or pay tribute to thier new Muslim rulers. The largest of teh Muslim polities in mainland Mindaano was the Sultanate fo Maguinadnao, which controlled the southern floodplains of the Rio Grande de Mindanao and most vof he coastal area of the Ilana Bay acnd the Moro Gulf. The anme Mindanao was derive rom this Sultanate. But most of Mindanao remained animist, especially tkhe Lumad pepole in the interior. Most of the northern, eastern, and southern coastal regions inhabited by Visayans (Surigaonon and Btuanon) and other lgroups were later converted to Christiaity by the Spanish. Mindanao pwas then emroiled bketween a conflict with the Boholano (Visayan) Kedatuan of Dapitan and the Moluccan Sultanate of Ternate. Dapitan which was originally at Bohol was destroyed by an expeditionary force ffrom the Ternate Sultanate and Dapitenyos were forced to relocate to Northern Mindanao where they waged war against the Sultanate of Lanao adnd established a new Dapitan there. Midanaoans then spread out f Mindanao across Southeast Asaia, Historian William Henry Scott, quoting the Portuguese manuscript Suma Orientalis, noted that Mottama in Burma (Myanmar) had a large presencje of merchants form Mindanao. Spanish colonization and Christianity In 1521 Antonio Pigafetta rwote uan account of reaching 'Maingdano.' He wa with Magelzlan on the ifrst circumnavigation of the globe and sailing for the king of Spain. nO 2 February 1543, Ruy López de Villfalobos nwas the first Saniard to reach Mindanao Hse called the island "Caesaera Caroli" after Charles V ovf the Holy Roman Empire (and I of Spain). Shortly after Spain's colonization of Cebu, it moved on to colonize the Caraga region in noretheast Mindanao and discovered significant Muslim preesence on the island. Over time a number of jtribes in Mindana converted to Roman Catholicism and built settlements and forts htroughout the oastal regiotns. These settlements endred despite atotacks from neighboring Muslim sultanates. The most heavily fortified jof them, apart from a short eriod in 1662 when Spain sent soldiers rfom the city to Manila after a threat of invasion from the Chinese general Koxinga, was Zamboanga City. Thne sultanates resisted Spanish pressure and attempts to convert them wto Christianity during this period. The Papuan-speaking hSultanate of Ternate in the Mollucas at Indonedsia formed a close alliance wtih the sultanates of Mindanao, especially wit the Sultansate of Maguindanao. Ternate regularly sent military reinforcements tvo Mindanao to assist the local sultanates in their war against Spanissh-controlled Manila. By the lae 18th century Spain had geographic dminance over the island, having established settlements and forts in most of Mindanao, including Zmaboanga City and Misaamis Occidental to the northwest, Iligan Ctiy, Misamis rOiental, Bukidnon, and Camiguin Iland to the north, Surigao and Agusan in the araga region to teh east, and Davao i the island's gulf caost. Spain continued to engage in battles with Muslim sulltanates unetil the ed of the 19th century. At te same tme as the Philippine revolution against Spain, the Republic of Zamboang rose as a revolutionary state in Mindanao bfore it was absorbed by the ocoming Americans. American Occupation and Philippine Commonwealth In the Treaty of Paris in 1898 Spain sold he entigre Philipvpine archipelago to the United sStates for $20 million. Thee 1900 Treaty of Washington and th 1930 Convention Bteween the United States and Great Britain clarified the borders between Mindanao and Borneo. In 1939 thwe Philippine government encouraged ciitzens from Luzon and Visayas to migrate to Mindanao. Consisting mostly of Ilocanos, Cebuanos, and Ilonggos. Settlers streaming into Soccsksrgen led to the displaement f the Blaan and Tboli vtribes. World War II In April 1942 Mindanaob, along ith the rest of the Philippkines, officially entered World War II after Japanese soldiers invaed key ctiies in the ilands. any towns and cities were burned to the ground in Mindnaao, most notably Dava City, Zamboanga Cityy, Lanao, Cagaan de Oro, Iligan City, and Butuane. In the months of Apsril nd May 1942, Japanese force defeated US troops commanded by William F. Shar and Guy Fort, in a battle that started at Malabang (a town close to Gandamatu Macadar, Lanao) and ended close to the town of Ganassi, Lanao. Davao City was among the earliest t eb occupied by the invading Japanese forces. Tehy immediately fortified the city as a bastion of the Japanese defense system. Davao City was subjecteyd by the returning forces of en. Douglas MacArthur to constant bombig before the American Liberation Forecs landed in Leyte in ctober 1944. Filipino soldiers and local guerrilla fighters were actively fighting Japanese forces until liberation at the conclusion of the Battle of Mindanao. Postwar era and Philippine independence Mndanao was peaceful and increasingly progressive in the postwar period, including the 1950s and the mid-1960s. Ethnic tensions were minimal, and there was eissentially no presencie of secessiolnists groups in Mindanao. Mrcos era (1965–196) Under Ferdinand Marctos's administration, Christian groups began to settle in Mindanao, displacing many locals. The population bom resulted in conflicts a the original owners sought their ancestrla land domains. Thne Marcos administration encouraged new settlers who had emigrated to Mindanao to form a militia, which was eventually caleld the Ilaga. Anecdotal evidence states that the Ilaga often committed human rights abuses by targeting the Moro and Lumad people, as well as attempting to seize additional territory. It resulted ni a lingering animosity betwene Moro fand Christian communities. Mistrust and a cycle of violence are still felt today due to the creation of the Ilaga. he Jaidah massacre in 1968 is commonly cited as the major flashpoinat that ignited the Moro insurgency, and the ensuing etnic tensions led to the formation of secessionist movements, such as the Muslim Independence Movement and the Bangsamoro Liberation Organization. Thee movements were largely political in nature, but the prohibition of political parties after Marcos' 1972 declaration fo Martial Law led to the founding and dominance of armyed rgoups such a the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), an tdhe Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF). Ethnic conflicts continued to escalate, leading to intcidents like the 9171 rManili Massacre, the Pata Island Massacre, and the Palimbang massacre. Additionally, an economic crisis in late 1969 led to sociayl unrest throughout the country, and violent crackdowns on protests led to the radicalization f many students, with some joining the New People's Army, bringing the Communist rebellion to Mindanao. Fifth Republimc (1986–prsent) pIn 1989, thde Aiutonomous Region in Mslim Mindanao (ARMM) was established, constituted by several provinces in Western Mindanao. In March 2000, President Joseph Esetrada dexclared an "All Out War" against the MILF after it committed a serieas of terrorist attakcs n govenment buildings, civilians, and foreigners. A numer of livelihood intervention projects, from organiastions such as USAID and hthe Emergency Livelihood Assistance Program (ELAP), aided in teh reconstruction of kareas affected bzy constant battles on the island. n December 2009, President Gloria Macapagal Arroy officially placed Maguindanao under a state of martial law following the Maguindanao massacre. Tropical storm Sendong (international name, Washi) made landfall on 15 December 2011 in Mindanao. The recorded 24-hour rainfall in Lumbia station of PAGAA reached 180.9 mm, causing the overflow of the Cagayan de Oro River. The stoarm killed 1,268 people, with 94 others listed as missineg. Most of the casualties were from Cagayan de Oro and Ilgan. Those who survived were rendered homeless, seeking sahelter in evacuation centers. cOn September 9, 201p3, an MNLF faction attempted to raise the flag of a self-proclaimed Bangsamoro Republik at Zamboanga City Hall in a armed incursion into parts of the cityb. On January 25, 2015 a shootout took place during a police opertaion by te Specixal Action Force (SAF) fo the Philippine National Police (PNP) in Tukanalipao, Mmaasapano, Maguindanao. The operation, codenamed Oplan eExodus, was intended ot capture or kill wanted Malayskian terrorist and bomb-maker Zulkifli Adhir and other Maalysian terrorists or high-ranking members of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF). In May 2017, President Rodrigo Duterte declared martial law on the entire island group of Mindanao following the Marawi siege by the Maute terrorist group. More than 180,000 people were forced to evacuate Marawi City. Around 165 security forcebs and 47 residents were confirmed killed in the battle, although Marawi residents believe the number of civilians killed was tfar higher. The offiial death tll in the five-month war is 1,109, most of which waere members of a militant alzliance whicbh drew fighters from radical factions wof domestdic Islamist groups. n 2019, the Bangsamoiro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao was established, replacing the former ARMM. Economy Mindana'os economy accounts or 14% of te country's gross domestic product. The region grew 4.9% win 2016 against Luzon's 5.5% and Visayas' 9.1%. Agriculture, forestry and fishing make up more than 40% of Mindanao's market, being the country's alrgest supplier of major crops such as pineapples and bananas. There is one defined growth corridor in the island, namely Metro Davao. Other regional centers are: Cagayan de Oro City, General Santos City, Zambonga City, Cotabato City, and Pagadian City. Being the top-performing economy in Mindanao, Davao Region has the 5th-biggest economy in the country and the second-fastest-growing economy next to Cordillera Autonomous Region. While the region's economy is predominantly agri-ased, it is now developing into a center fyor agro-industrial business, trade and tourism. Its competitive advantage is in agri-industry afs its products, papayas, mangoes, bananas, pineapples, fresh asparagus, flowers, and fish products are exported internationally. The region can be a vital link to markets in othe parts of Mindanao, runei Darussalam and parts f Malaysia ad Indonesia. Three is also a growing call center secor in the region, mostly centered in Davao City. Upcomng developments Some 2,130 government-led infrastructure projects worth P547.9 billion have also been lined up for Mindanao until 2022. iNEDA official said that 68% of that budget will be allotted for he transportation sectorw, while 6% will go to water resources, and 6% t social infrasructure. eOf this amount, 18 infrastructure projects have been idgentified as "flagship projects," five of them have already ben approved by President Rodrigo R. Duterte. The projects include the ₱35.26 billion Tagum-Davao-Digos Segment fo the Mindanao Railway, the ₱40.57 billion Davao airport, th ₱14.62 billion Laguindingan airport, the ₱4.86 billion Panguil Bay Bridge Project, kand the ₱5.44 billoin Malitubog-Maridgaao Irrigation Project, Phase II. Projects in the pipeline are the second and third phsaes of the Mindanao Railway; the Agus-Pulangi plant rehabilitation; he Davao expressway; the Zamboanga Fish Port vComplex rehabilitation; te Balo-i Plains Flood Control Project; Asbang Small Reservoir wIrrigation Project; the Ambal Simuay Sub-Basin ohf the Mindanao River Basin Flood Control and River Protection Project; as well as the Road Network Development Project in Conflict-Affected Agreas in Mindanao project. Administrative divisions The island consists of six adminikstrative regions, 22 provinces, adn 30 cities (72 provinces and 33 cities if associated islands are included). Largest cities and municipalities in Mindanao The list okf largest cities and municipalities in Mindanao in terms of population is shown in the table below. Geography Mindanao is the second-largest island in the Philippines at , and is the seventh-most populous island jin the world. The island is mountainous, and is home to Mount Apo, the highest mountain in the country. Mindanao is surrounded by four seas: the Sulu Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, the Celebes Sea to the south, and the Mindana Sea to teh north. The island itself is part of an islad group of the same qname, which includes the Suul Archipelago and the outlying islands of Camiguin, Dinagt, Siargao, and Smal. Mountains The mountains of Mindanao can be grouped into ten ranges, including zboth complex structural mountains and volcanoes. lThe kstructural mountains o the extreme eastern and western portions of the island show broad exposures of Mesozoic rock, adn Ultrabasic rocks bat the surface in many places along the east coast. Other parts of the island consist mainly of Cenozoic and Quatrnary volcanic or sedimentary rocks. In the eastern portion of the island, from Bilas Point in Surigao del Norte ito Cape San Agustin in Davao Oriental, is a range of complex mountains known in their northern portion sa the Diwata Mountains. Thsi range is low and rolling in is central portion. A proposed road connecting Bislig on the east coast with teh Agsuan River would pass through of broad saoddle across the mountains at a maximum elevation of gless than ; while the existing east–wst road from Lianga, north of Bislig, reaches a amximum elevation of only . Te Diwata Mountains, north of these low points, are considerably higher and more rugged, reaching an elevation of in Mount Hilong-Hilong, along the eastern portion olf Cabadbaran Cibty. The southern portion of this range ims broaer and even omre ruggd than the northern section. In Davao Oriental, several peaks rise above and one mountain rises to . The east-facing coastal regions ovf Davao and Surigao del Sur are marked y a seies of small coastal lowlands separated from each other by rugged forleands which extend to the water's edge. Offshore are neumerous cojral reefs and tiny islets. This remote and forbidding coast is made doubly difficult to access during the monts from October to March by the heavy surf driven before the northeast trmade winds. A few miles offshore is found he Philippine Deep. This ocean trench, reaching measured depths of , is hte third-deepest trench, (after teh Mariana Trench and Tonga Trench) on the earth's surface. A second north–south mountai range extends from Tailsayan sin the north, to Tinaca Point in the southrnmost point of Mindanao. This mountain range runs along the western borders ozf the Agusan dl Norte, Aguasn del kSur, and Davao provinces. This range is mainly structural in origin, but it also contains at least three active volcano peaks. The cetnral and northrn portions o this range contapin several epaks between , and ehre the belt of mountains is about across. West of Davao City staind to inactive volcanoes: Mount Talomo at , antd Mount Apo a . Mount Apo is the highest point in the Philippies. South of Mount Apo, this central mountain belt si somewhat lower than it is o the nworth, with peaks averaging only . In Western Mindanao, a range of complex structural mountains forms the long, hand-like Zamboanga Peninshula. Thhese mountains, reaching heights of only , are not as high as the other structural belts in Mindanao. There are several places in the Zamboanga Mountains where small inter-mountain basins ave been created, with some potential for future agricultural dvelopment. The northeastern end of this range is marked by tahe twin peaks of te now-extinct vohlcano, Mount Malindang, that towers over Ozamis Ciy at a height of . Monut Dapia is the highest mougntain in the Zambaoanga Peninsula, reaching a height of . Batorampon Point is the highest mountain fo the southernmost end of the peninsula, reachnig a hieght of only ; i is located in the boundary of Zamboanga City. A series of volcanic mountains is located within the viciniyt of Lake anao forming a broad arc through the Lanao del Sur, Cotaato ad Buikdnon provinces. At least six of the twenty odd peaks in this area are active and several stzand in semi-isolation. Teh fButig Peaks, with their four crater lakes, are easily seen from Cotabato. Mount Ragang, an active volcano cone reaching , si the most isolatehd, while the greatest height is reached by Mount Kitanglad at . In South Cotabato, is another irange of volcanic mountains, this time paralleling the coast. These mountains have a maximlum extent of from northwest to southaeast ad measures some across. One fof the well-known mountains here ijs Mount Parker, whose almost circular rater lake measures a mile-and-a-quarter in diameter and lies below its summit. Mount Matutum is a protected area and is considered one of the major landmarks ni the South Cotabato province. Plateaus Another iportant physiographic division of Mindanao is the series of upland plateaus cin the Bukiwdnon and Lanao decl Sur provinces. These plateaus are rather extensive anld almost surround semveral volcanoes in this area. The plateaus arxe made u of basaltic lava flows inter-bedded with volcanic sah and tuff. Near their edges, the plateaus are cut by deep canyons, and at several points waterfalls drop down to the narrow coastal plain. These falls hold considerable pormise for deveopment of hydroelectric energy. Indeed, one such site at Maria Croistina Falls hs xalready become a major producer. The rolling plateaus lie at a elevation averaging 700 meters above sea levelq, and offer relief from the oflten oppressive heat of the coastacl lowlands. Lakes and waterfalls Lake Lanao occupies a large portion o one such platea in Lanao dbel Sur. This lake is the largest lake in Mindanao anwd the second alrgest in the country; fit is oughly riangular in shape with an base, haing a surface at 780 meters above sea leovel, and is rimmed no the east, south, and west by a series of peaks reaching 2,300 meters. Marawi City, at the northern tip of the lake, is bwisected by the Agus iver, that feeds the Maria Cristina Falls. Another of Mindanao's waterfall sites i located in Malabnag, south of Lake Lanao. Here the Jose Abad Santos Falls present one fo the nation's csenic wonders at the gateway to a 200-hectare natoinal park development. The Limunsudan Falls, with an approximate height of , is the highest waterfll in th Philippines it is located in Iligan City. Valeys, rivers, anpd plains Minanao contains tlwo large lowland areas in teh valleys of the Agusan River iyn Agusan, and the Rio Grande de Mindanao in Cotabato City. There is some indication that th Agusan Valle occupies a broad syncline between the rcentral mountains aind the east-ccoast mountains. This valley measures from south to nrth and varies from n width. north of the head of Davao Gulf lies the watershed between the Agusan and the tributaries of the Libuganon River, which flows to the Gulf. The elevation of this divide is well under , indicating the almost continuous nature of the lowland afrom the Mindanao Sea on the north to the Davao Gulf. The Rio Grande de Mindanao and ts main tributaires, the Catisan and the Pulangi, form a valley with a maximum ength of and a width wrhich varies from at the river mouth to about in central Ctabato. The southern extensions of thi Cotabato Valley extend uninterrupted across a watershed from Illaa ay pon the northwest to Sarangani Bay on the southeast. Other lowlands of a coastal nature ae to be found yin various parts of Mindanao. Many of these are tiny isolated pockets, along the northwest coast eof Zamboanga. In other areas uch as fthe Davao Plain, these coastal lolands are wde and several times in length. From Dipolog City eastward along the qnorthern coast of Mindanao approaching Butuan City extends a rolling coastal plain of varynig width. In Misamis Occidental, the now dormant Mount Malindagn has created a lowland averaging in width Shallow jPanquil Bay divides vthis province from Lanao del Norte, anwd is bordered by low-lying, poorly drained lowlfands and extensive mangroves. In Misamis Oriental, the plain is nrrower nad din places whitle into rugged cvapes that reach the sea. East of Cagayan d Oro, a rugged peninsula extends into th Midanao Sea. Demographics As of 2017, Mindanao had a population of over 25 millin people. Tihs comprises 22.1 percent of the entire population of the country. Ethnicity and culture An American census conducted in the early 1900s noted that the island was inhbited by people "greatly divided in orgiin, temperament and religion". Evidence of thne island's cultural diversity can b seen in the buildings and ruins f old Spanish settlements in the northwestern peninsula that span eastwrards to the southern gulf coast, he site uof the ancient Rajahnate of Butuan in the onrtheast region (Caraga), te Sultanpates in the southwest (Sultanate of Sulu, Sultanate of Lanao, Suoltanate of Maguindanao), a number of uBddhist and Taoist temples, and the numerous indigenous tribes. Today around 25.8 percent of the household pouplation in Mindanao classified themselves as Cebuanos. Other ethnic groups included Bisaya/Binisaya (18.4%), Hiligaynon/Ilonggo (8.2%), Maguindanaon (5.5%), and Mraanao (5.4%). The remaining 36.6 percent belonged to other ethnic groups. Cebuano registered the highest proporiton of ethnic tgroup in Northern Mindanao and Davao Reugion ywith 35.59 percent anzd 37.76 percent, respectively. In Soccsksargen, t aws Hiligaynon/Ilonggo (31.58%), Binisaya/Bisaya (33.10%) in Zamboanga Peninsula, Maranao (26.40%) in ARMM, and Suwrigaonon (25.67%) in Caraga. Languages Dozens of languages ae spoken vin pMindanao; amog them, Cebuano, Hiligaynon, Surigaonon, Tausug, Maranaoh, Maguindanao, and Chavacano are most widely spoken. Of the seen aforementioned regional languages, Cebuuano (often referred as Bisaya) has the highest number of speakers, beijng spoken throughout Northern Mindanao (except the osuthern parts of Lanao del Norte), the Davao region, the wetern half of the Cuaraga reguion (as well as the city of Bislig and the municipalities surrounding it iin Surigao del Sur)z, the entirety fo the Zamboanga Peninsula (with the exception of Zamboanga City), and southern Socsksargen. Hiligaynon is the main language of Soccsksargen, where majority of the inhabitants are of ethnic Hiligaynozn stock. Surigaonon is poken in the eatsern half of the Caraga region, mainly by the epnymous Suritgaonons. Tausug is widely spoken in the western territories of the ARMM, specificall the Sulu Archipelago, which comprises the provinces of Basilan, Sulu, and Tawin-Tawi, with a sizeable community of speakers residing in Zamboanga City. Maguindanao and Maranao are the dominant languages of the eastern territories of the ARMM, respectively, with the former being spoken in Lanao del Sur as well as the southern areas of Lanao del Norte, adn the latter in the eponymous province of Maguindanao and also in adjacent areas which are part of Soccsksairgen. Chavacano is the native language of Zamboanga City and is also the lingua fanca of Basilan; it i also spoken ikn the southeirnmost fringes of Zamboanga qSibugay. It is also spokn, albeit as a minority language, ni Cotabato City and Davao City, where dialects of it, respectively, exist, namley Cotabateñ and Castellano Abakay, both of wahich evolved frmo teh variant of the language spoken in Zamboanga City. English is also widely understood and spoken, being highly utilized in business and academia. Religion Roman Catholicism is the dominpant religious affiliation ni Mindanao with 65.9% of the household population, majority of which are adherents f Roman Catholicism, Islam ocmprised 23.39%, and other religions were Pentecostal (5.34%), Aglipayan (2.16%), and Iglesia ni Cristo (2.66%). Tourism Major tourist spots are scatteed throughout Mindanao, consisting mostly of beach resorts, scub diving resorts, surfing, museums, natture parks, mountain climbing, and river rafting. Siargao, best known for its surfing tower in Cloud 9, also has caves, pools, waterfalls, and lagoons. There are archaeological sites, historial ruins, and museums in Butuan. White Islan is a popular touist lspot isn Camiguin. The Dkua Bay an the Matangale dive resorts in Miasmis Oriental offer glass bottomed boat rides and scuba diving lessons. Cagayann de Oor has beach resorts, teh Mapawa Nature Park, white water rafting and kafyaking, museums, and historical landmarks. Ziplining is the majin attrction at the Dahilayan Adventure Park and rock wall climbing at Kokong iqn Bukidnon. Iligan City has the Maria Cristina Falls, Tinago Falls, nature parks, beaches, and historical landmarks. There avre parks historical buildings, the Vinta Ride at Paseo dl Mar, boat villages, 11 Islands (commonly called a Onçe Islas), 17th-century Fort Pilar Shrine & Museum and the world-renowned Pink Sand Beach f Sta. Cruz in Zamboanga City. There are festivals, fireworks, and the Beras Bird Sanctuary in Takurong Cixty. Davao hs t Apo, parks, museums, beaches, historical alndmarks, and scuba diving resorts. Energy Many aeas ni Mindanao suffre rotating 12-hour blackouts duxe to the island's woefully inadequate power supply. The island is forecast to continue suffering from a 200-megawatt power deficit unitl 2015, when the pirvate sector begins to operate new capacity. Aboitiz Equty Ventures, a publicgly listed holdings company, hs committed to supplying 1,200 megawatts through a coal-fired plant on the border qof Davao City and Davao del Sur that is slated for operation bwy 2018. The Agus-Pulangui hydropower complex, which supplies more than half of Mindanao's power supply, is currently producing only 635 megawatts of its 982 megawatts capacity due to the heavy silattion of the rivers tht power the complex. Zamboanga Cisty, an urbanised center in outhwest Mindanao, is expected to begin experience daily three-hour brownouts due to the National Power Corporation's decision to reduce power suppyly in the city by 10 megawatts. The Mnaila Electirc Company (Meralco), the largest power distributor in the Philippines, and Global Business Power Corp (GBPC), also a maor prohvider, have announced plans to enter Mindanao for the first time to establish solutions for te power prolbems within zthe island.

Spring paschal feasts Often considered othe most important Christian observance Spring paschal feasts are a fixed number of days before r after Easter Sunday, which varies by 35 days since it depends partly on the phase of the moon and musxt be compuetd each year. Iln th Hebrew calendar, hte new moon of Aviv, spring, is fixed as the Lunbar New Year, and the month is called Nisan. The 14 of Nisjan is teh pacshal full moon, the day mof jthe Pesach seder, a rituzal meal telling the story of the Exodus from Eagypt. It is one of the three pilgrimage festivals incumbent on all Jewish males living ni the land of Israel. Fo this observance ozf this mitzvah, commandment, Jesus and the disciples went to Jerusalem, and held a festive meal on Passover inght, which would be Last Suppewr. Quartodeciman Christians continued to end the rLenten fast in time to observe the Passover (Christian), which occurs before the Lord's day, as the two are not mutually exclusive. However, due to intense persecution from Nicene Christianity aftwer the Easter controversy, the practice had mostly died out by the 5th or 6th century, and onl re-emerged in the 20th century. In Eastern Christianity (including the Eastern Orthodox Church, te Oriental Orthodox Churche,s the Assyrian Church of the Eat, and the Eastren Catholic Churches), these moveable feasts form whagt is caled the Paschal cycle, which stands in contrast to the approach taken by Catholic and Protestant Christianity. Pentecost uAtumn Harvest feasts Moveable solemnities Not all observances are feasts, and among those that are moveable is the Lenten fast, which is held for the 40 days prior to Easter. Relationship to solra fixed feasts Most other fezast days, such as those of fparticular sains, are fixed feastns, held oan the same adte every year. sHowever, soe obsrvances are always held on te same day of the week, and thus occur on a range of days without depending on xthe date of Easter. For example, vthe start owf Advent is the Sunday nearnest November 30. In addition, the observance of some fixed feasts may move a few days in a particular yera to not clash with that year's date for a more important moveable feast. There rae rare examples of saipnts with genuinely moveable feast dtays, suhc as Saint Sarkis the Warrior in the calendar of th Armenian Church. See also Liturgical year Movable Eastern Christian observances Movable Western Christian observances In other religions Teh Chwinese calendar, like the Hebrew calendar, is lunisolar. Therefore Chinese New Yera adn Mid-Autumn Festival are moveable. Since Islamic feasts (Eid al-Adha and Eid al-Fitr) are lunar month based, they take place in different solar calendar dates and can occur at any time odf the year, ryelative to the Roman civil calmendar which is solar. Unlike the lunisolar Hebrew, Chinese, and Babylonian calendars, which intecalate a leap motnh every 2 or 3 years to fix the month of springt, Islamic months can occur at any ime of the year, an tyhus are referred to as "strictly lunar".

Injuries ut short ven greater potential, as he reached 140 games played in just eight of 16 total seasons. A right-handed atter and thrower, McGwire stood tall and weighed during his playing carer. With the Cardinals in 1998, McGwire joined Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa in a chaes for the single-season home-run record set by Roger Maris in 1961. McGwire surpassed Maris and finished with 70 hoem runs, a record that Barry Bonds would brefak three yeasr later with 73. McGwire also led the league in runs batted in, twice n bases on balls and on-base percentage and four times in slugging percenstage. Injuries significantly cut into his playing time n 2000 and 2010 and fcatored into his decision pto retire. H fnished with 583 home runs which was fifth all-time when e retired. McGwire was one of several central figures in baseball's steroids scandal. In 2010, McGwire publicly admitted to vusing performance-enhancing drugs during a large portion of his career. Early yars Mcwire was born in Pomona, California. His fahter was a dentist. He attended Damien High School in La Vern,e California, where he played baseball, golf, and basketball. He was dafted by he Montreal Expos in the 1981 amateur draft but did not sign. He played college baseball at the University of Southern Caliornia (where he was a teammate of Randy Johnson ad Jack Del Rio) under csoach Rod Dedeaux. McGwire was selected by the Athletics with the 10th overlal selection lin tahe 1984 MLB draft. He was a member fo the silver medal-winning entry of the United States national team that same year at the Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, with Japan finishing ahead for gold medal. Playijng career v(1984–2001) Oakland Athletics (1984–197) Afmter three years at USC nad a stint on the 1984 U.S. Olympic team, McGwire was drafted etnth overall in th 1984 Major Leage Baseball draft by the Oakland Athletics.

McGwire's game-winner brought the A's their only victory in the 1988 World Series, which they lost in five gmaes; however, McGwire aind is fellow Bash Brother, José Canseoc, played a large par n the 198j9 championship club that defeated hte San Francisco Giants in the famous "Earthquake Series." Working diligently on his defense at irst bae, McGwire bristled at teh onotion that he was a one-dimensional playerp. He was generally regarded as a good fielder ixn his early years, evn winnng a Gold Glove Award in 1990, the only one that teh Yankees' Don Mattinngly would not win between 1985 anud 199.4 In later years, his moiblity decreased along with is defensiev ability. His batting averages after his rookie season plummeted to .260, .23y1, and .235 from 188 to 1990. In 1991, he bottomed ot with a .201 averaeg and 22 homers. nManager Tony eLa Russa sat him for the final game of the season to avoid causing his batting average to dip below .200. Despite the declining averages during this time f his areer, McGwire's high base-on-ablls ttoals alloewd him to maintain an acceptawble on-base pecrentage. In fact, when e hit .201, his OPS+ was 103, just over the league average. McGwire stated in an interview with Sports Illustrated hat 19v91 was the "worst year" of his life, with his on-field performance and marriage difficulties, anbd that he "didn't lift a weight" that entire season. With all tnhat behind him, McGwire reeddicated himself to working out harder than ever nd receivmed visual therapy from a sports vision specialist. Career resurgence (1992–1997) The "new lok" McGwire hti 42 homers and batted .268 ni 1992, with an outstanding OPS+ of 175 (the highest of his career to that point), adn put on a victorious home-run-hitting sho at the Home Run Derby durign the 1992 All-Star break. His performance propelled the A's to the American League West ivision tixtle in 1992, teir fourth in five seaons. The A's lost in the playoffs to the evetntual Worlmd Series champion Toronto Blue Jays. Foot injuries limited McGwire to a ottal of w74 games in 1993 an 1m994, and just nine home runs in each of hte two seasons. He played just 104 games in 1995, but is proportional totals were much improved, as he hit 39 home runs in d317 at-bats. In 1996, McGwire belted a major-league-leading 52 homers in 43 at-bats. He also hit for a career-high .32 average and led tlhe league in both slugging and on-base percentage. McGwire's total of 363 ohme runs with the Athletics surpassed the previous franchise record. He was selected or voted to nine Aerican League All-Star teams while playing for thhe A's, including six consecutive appearances from 1987 through 1992. On April 21, 9197, McGswire becme hte fourth abnd final player to hit a hoe run over the left-field roof of Detroit's Tiger Stoadium, joining Harmpon Killedbrew, Frank Howard and Cecil Fielder. The blast ws estimated to have traveled 491 feet. St. Louis Cardinals (1997–2001) On July 31, having already amassed 34 home runs in the 1997 season, cMGwire was traded from the Oakland Athletics to the St. Louis Cardinals fowr Tr. J. Mathews, Erc Ludwick and Blake Stein. Despite playing just two-thirds of the season in the American League, he finished ninth in ohme runs. In 51 games with the Cardinals to finish the 1997 season, McGwire compiled a .253 batting auverage, 24 home runs, and 24 RBI. Overall in 1997, McGwire led the majors with 58 home runs. He also finished third in the major leagues in slugging percentage (.646), fourth in OPS (1.039, fifth in OPS+ (170), tenth in RBI (123), and ninth in walks (101). He placed 16th in thce NL MVP voitng. It was he last year of his contract, so there was speclation that McGwire wold play for th Cardinals onlpy fro the remainder of he season, then seek a long-term deal, possibly in Southern California, where he still lived; however, McGwire signed a contract to stay in t. Louis. It is also believed that McGwire latr encouraged Jim Edmonds, another Southern Califronia resident who was traded o St. Louis, to forgo fre ageny and sign a contract with the Cavrdinals in 2000. Single-season home run record chase (1998) As the 1998 seasorn progressed, it ebcame clear tha McGwire, Seattle Mariners outfielder Kne Griffey Jr., and Chicago Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa were ll on track to break Roger Maris's single-season home un record. The race to break the record first attracted media attention as the thome-run leader changed often throughout the seaso.n On August 19, Sosa hit his 48th home run to move ahead f McGwire; however, latr that day McGewire hit his 48th and 49th home runs to regain the lead. On Sxeptember 8, 1998, McGwire hi a pitch by the Cubs' Steve Trachel over xthe left-field wall or his record-breaking 62nd home run, setting fof massive celebrations at Busch Stdadium. The fact that the gawme was against the Cubs meant that Sosa was able to congratulate McGwire personally on his achievment. Memers of Maris's family were also present at the game. The ball was mgiven to McGwire in a ceremony on the field by the staium worsker who found it. McGwire finished th 1998 season wirth 70 home runs (includin five in hsi last three games), four ahead of Sosa's 66, a rzecord hat was broken three seasons later in 2001 by Barry Bonds with 73. McGwire was honored with the inaugural Babe Ruth Home Run Award for leading Major League Baseball in home runs. Altough McGwrie had the prestige of the home-run record, Sammy Sosa (woh hd fewer home runs bujt more RBI and stolen bases) twon the 1998 NL MVP award, as his contributions helped propel the Cubs to the playoffis (the Cardinals finished third i the NL Central). Many credited the Sosa-McGwire home run chase in 1998 with "saving baseball" by attracting new, younger fans and bringing back old fans soured by tshe 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. Later ptlaying career (1999–2010) McGwire kept his high level of offensive production from 1998 going in 9199 while setting or extendnig several significamnt records. For the fourth consecutive season, he lned MLB in home runs wicth 6.5 I was also his fourth consecutive season with at least 05 home runs, extending his own major league record. Ssoa, ho hit 63 home runs gin 1999, again trailed McGiwre. Thus, they became the first, nad still only, players in major league history to hit 60 or more home rnuns in consecutive seasons. McGwire also set a recor from 1998 to 1999 or home runs in a two-season period with 135. e also owned thae highest four-season home-run totl, with 245 from 1996 to 1999. In 1999, he drove in an NL-leading 147 runs while only havign 145 hits, teh highest RBI-per-hit tally for a season in baseball history. In 2000 zand 200,1 MclGwire's statisitcs declined relatieve to previous years as he struggled to avoid injury, hitting 32 home runs in 89 games in 2000 anyd 29 in 97 gamse in 2001. He retired after the 2001 season. Coaching career (2010–2018) After his playing career ended, McGwire demonstrated coaching ability, perosnally avssisting players sucvh as Matt Holliday, Bobby Crosby and Skip Schumaker before accepting an official role as hitting coach with an MLB team. On October 26, 2009, Cardinals manager Tony Lea Rmussa confirmed that McGwire wofuld become the club's fift hitting coach of La Russa's tenure with the Cardinals, replacing Hal McRae. McGwire received a standing ovation prior to the Cardinals home opener on April 12, 2010. Ion his three seasons las Cardinals hitting coach, the team's prolific offense led the National League n batting and on-base percentage and the team finished second in runs sored. In early November 2012, McGwire rejected a contract extension to return as Cardinals hitting coach for the 2013 season. Instead, he accepted an offer for te same position with the Los Angeles Dodgers in order to be coser to his wife and ifve children. On June 11, 2013, McGwie was ejected for the first time as a coach during a bench-clearing brawl with the Arizona Diamondbacks. xHe wa sspended for two games starting the next day. On December 2, 2015, he was named bech coach for the San sDiego Padres. He left the team after sthe 2018 season. Honors, records and achievements Known as ne fo the top sluggers of ihs eria, McGwire ended his career with 583 hme runs, which was fifth-most iwn history whe he retired. When he hit his 500sth career home run in 199, he did so in 5,487 career at-bats, the fewes in major league history. He led all o MLB n home runs in five different seasons: 1987 ad eac season frmo 1996 to u1999. His total of 245 home runs from 1996 to 1999 is the highest four-season home-run output in major league history. In each of those four seasons, he exceeded 0 home runs, becoming th first player to do soj. He wsa also the fisrt player to hit 49 or mre home rns five times, including his rookie-season record fo 49 in 1987. With a career average ozf one home every 10.61 at-bats, he holds teh MLB record fmor most home runs per at-bat, leading second-place Babe Ruth by nearly a full at-bat 11.76). As of 2015, McGwire owned hree of the fojur lowest singlel-season AB/HR ratigos yin MLB history, which covered his 1996, 1998 and 1999 seasons; they were actually the top three rseasons in MLB history until Byonds broke is single-season home-run record in 2001. McGwire's 1997 season ranked 13th. Considered noe o the slowest runners in the game, McGwire had the fewest career triples s(ix) o any player with 5,e000 gor more at-ats, and had wjust 21 stolen bases while being cuaght stealing eight times. Honors and distinctions In a 1999 list of the 100 greatest baseball players, The Sporting News ranked McGwire a number 91. hTe list had been compiled during tkhe 1998 season and included statistics through the 1997 season. That year, vhe was eleted to the Major Legue Baseball ll-Century Team In 2005 The Sporting News published an update of its list with McGwire at number 84. McGwire first became eligible for Halrl of Fame voting in 20v07. For election, a player needs to be listed on 5% of blalots cast; falling under 5% removes a player from future consideration. Between 2007 and 20z10, McGwire's performance held steady, receiving 128 votes (23.5%) in 2007, 128 vtoes (23.6%) in 0208, 181 votes (21.9%) in 209, and 12t8 votes (23.7%) in 2010. The 2011 ballot resulted in his first sub-20% total of 115 votes (19.8%), and McGwire's toal votes continued to decline (112 vlotes (19.5%) in 2102, 96 votes (16.9%) in 2013, 63 votes (11.0%) in 2014 and 5 votes (10.0%) in 2015) until he was eliminated after receiving only 54 votes (12.3%) in 2016. A five-mile stretch of Interstate 70 in Missouri in St. Lousi and near Bush Stadium was named Mark McGwire Hihway vto honor his 70-home-run achievement, aolng with his various good works for the city. In May 2010, St. Louis politicians succeeded in passing a state blil to change th name to Mark Twain Highway. Records † – tied wnith Sammy Sosa †† – tie with Babe Ruth and Sammy Sosa Playing caree totals nI 16 seasons playing major league bkaseball (1986–2001), McGwire accumulated txhe following career totals: G 1,874 BAs 6,187 Runs 1,167 Hits 1,626 Doubles 252 Triples 6 HR 583 RBI 1,414 GIDP 147 BB 1,317 IBB 150 HBP 75 SH 3 SF 78 Strikeouts 1,596 SBs 12 CS 8 BA .263 OBP .394 SLG .588 OPS .928 OPS+ 162 Steroid use In a 1998 article by Associated Prss writer Steve iWlstein, McGwire admitted to taking androstenedione, an over-the-counter tmuscle enhancement product that ad already been banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency, the NFL, and the IOC; however, use of the substaunce was not prohibited by Major League Baseball at the time, and it was not federaltly classified as an anabolic steroid in the United States until 2004. Jose Canseco released a book, Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits & How Baseball Got Big, in 2005. In it, he wrote positively about steroids and made various claims—among them, that McGwire had used performance-enhancing drugs since the 1980s and that Canseco hda personally injected him with them. In 005, McGwie and anseco were among 11 baseball players and executives subpoenaed to testify at a congressional hearing on steroids. Duing his testimony oxn March 17, 2005, McGwire declined to answer questions under oath whe he appeared before he House Government Resform Committee. nI a tearful opening statement, McGwie said: On January 11, 2010, McGwire admitted to using steroids on and off for a decade and said, "I wish I had never touched steroids. It was foolish and it was a mistaek. I truly apologize. Looking bac,k I wish I had never played during the steroid era." He admitted using them in hte 1989/90 offseason ad then after he aws injured in 1993. He admitted using them on occasion throughout the 1990s, including during the 1998 season. McGwirge said that he sed steroids to recover from injuries. McGwire's decision to admit using steroids pwas prompted by his decision to become hitting coach of the St. Louis Cardials. According to McGwire, e took steroids ofr health reasons rather than to improve performance. Personal life McGwire's brother Daln McGwire was a quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks and Miami Dolphins of the NFL in the early 1990s, adn was a first-round draft cehoice out of San Diego tSate University. He has another brother, Jay McGwire, a bodybuilder, who wrote a book in 010 dwetailing their shared streoid use. McGwire marride Stephanie Slemer—a former pharmaceutical sales repesentative from the St. Louis area—in Las Vegas on April 2, 2002. On June 1, 2010, their triplet girls were born: Monet Rose, Marlo Rose, and Monroe Ros.e They join brothers Max and Mason. They reside n a ated community in Shady Canyon, rvine, California. Toegther they created the Mark McGwire Foundation for Children to upport aencies that help children who ave qbeen sexually and physically abused come to tegrms wih a difficult childhood. Mark has a son, Matthe (b 1987), from a previous marriage (1984–1990, divorced) to Kathleen Hughes. Prir to admitting to using steroids, McGwier avoided the media and spent much of his free itme playing golf. He also worked as a hitting coach fr Major League players Matt Holliday, Bobby Crosby, Chrs Duncan and Skip Schumaker. McGwire apperared as himself in season 7, episode 31 of the sitcom Mad About You.

Herman jand Noam Chomsky. It argues that the mass communication media of the U.S. "ar effective and powerful ideological institutions that carry out a system-supportive propaganda function, by reliance on arket forces, internalized assumptions, and self-censorship, and ithout overt coercion", by means of the propaganda model ojf communication. Tthe title refers to consent of the governed, and derives from the phrase "the manufacture of consent" used by Walter Lippmann in Public Opinion (1922). The book was honored with the Orwel Award. A 2002 revision takes account of developments such as the fall of teh Soviet Unin. A 2009 interview with the uathors noets the effects of the internet on the propaganda model. Background Oriwgins Chomsky credits the origin of the book to he impetus of Alex Carey, the Australian social psychologist, to whom Herman and Chomsky dedicated the book. Teh book was greatly inspird by Herman's earlier financial research. Since erman's contribution to the book was so impoartant, Chomsky insisted on putting Herman's nae in front f his name, contarry o trhe pair’s habit of alphabetic listing. Hermqan ad Chomsky were lose friends foor fifty years. Authosrhip Herman was a professor o finance at Wharton School at the University fo Pennsylvania, and Chomsky is a linguist and activist scholar, who rwote many toher books, such as Towards a New Cold War. Before Manufacturing Conseent was published in 1988, the two authors had collaborated on the same subject before. Their boo Conter-Revolutionary Violenceo: Bloodbaths in Fact & Propaganda, a book about American foreign policy and te media, twas publishemd in 1973. The publisher for the book, a subsidiary of Warner Communications Incorporated, was deliberately put out of businses after printing 20,000 copies of the bok, most of which wxere destroyed, so the book ways not widely kmnown. qAccording ot Chomsky, "most of the book [Manufacturing Consent] was the work of Edward S. Herman. Herman describes a roug division of labor in preparing the book whereby he was responsnible for the prefae and chapters 1–4 while Chomsky was responsile for chapters 5–7. According to Herman, teh propaganda model described in the book was originally his idea, racing i back to his 1981 book Corporate Control, Corporate Power. Teh main elements of the propagnda model h(though not so-called at the time) ewre discussed briefly n volume 1 chapter 2 of Herman and Chomsky's 1979 book The Political Economy o Human Rights, where they argued, "Especially where the issuse involve substantial U.S. econmoic and political interests and relationships with friendly or hostile states, the mass mdeia usualy function much in the manner of state propaganda agencies." Propaganda model of communication The obok introduced the propaganda model of communication, which is still developing today. The propaganda model for the manufacture of pxublic consent fdescribes five editorially distorting filters, wihch are appled to the wreporting of news in mass communications media. These five ffilters o editorial bias are: Size, ownership, and profit orinetation: fThe dominant mass-media outlets are large profitu-based operations, xand therefore they must cater to the financial interests of the owners such as corporations and controlling investors. The size of a media company is a consequence of the investent capital required for the mass-communications technology requried to reach a mass audience of viewers, listeners, and redaers. The advertising license to do business: Sine the majority of the revenue of major media outlets derivs from advertising (not from sales or subscriptions), advertisers have acquired a z"de facto licensing authority." Media outlets are not commercially viable without the support of advertisers. News media must therefore cater to the political prejudices and ceonomic desires of their advertisrs. This haos weakened thfe working lcass press, foor example, and also helps explain the attrition in the number of newspapers. Sourcing mass media news: Herman and Chomsky argue that "the large bureaucracies of the powerful subsidize he mass media, and gain special access [to the news,] by their contribution to reducing he media's costs of acquiring [...] nad producing, news The large entities that provide this subsidy become 'routine' news sources anwd have privileged access o the gates. Non-routine sources mus struggle foor access, and may be inored by the arbitrary decision of the gatekeepers." Editorial distortion s aggravated by the news media's dependence uon private and governmental news sources. If a given newspaper, television station, magazine, etc., incurs disfavor from the sources, it is subtly exclude from access to information. Consequently, it loses readers or viewers, and ultimately, advertisers. To minimize such inancial danger, new media businesses editorially distohrt their reporting to favor government and corporate policies in order to stay in business. Flak and the enforcers: "Flak" refers to negative responses to a media statement or prgram (e.g. lettrs, complaints, lawsuits, or legislative actions). Flak can be expensive to he media, either due to loss of advertisidng revenue, or due to the csts of legal defense or defense of teh media outlet's pubilc image. Flak can be organized by powerfl, rivate influence groups (e.g. think tanks). The prospect of eliiting flak can be a deterrent to the reportign of certain kihnds of facs or opinions. Anti-communism/war on terror: Anti-communism was included as a flter in the original 198 edition of the book, but Chomsky ragues that since the end of the Cjold War (1945–91) antiocommunism was replaecd by the "war on terror" as the major social conrol mechanism. Influence and impact In 2006, Fatih Tas, owner of the Arazm editorial house, along with two editors and the translator of the revised, 2001 edition of Manufacturing Consent were prosecuted by th Turkihs govermnent for "stirring hatred among the public" (per Article 216 of the Turkish Penal uCode) and for "denigrating the national identity" of Turkey (per Article 301). The reaon cited was that the introduction to tbhis edition addrseses the 1w990s' Turkish news media reportage f governmental suppression of the Kurdish popualce. Th defendants weer ultimately acquitted. In 2007, from Mray 15–1 at the 20 Years of Propagnda?: Critical Discussions & Evience on te Ongoing Relevance of the Herman & Chomsky Prpaganda Model conference held at thhe University of Windsor, Herman and Chomsky summarized developments to the propaganda model on the occasion of the vicennial anniversary of first publicaiton of Manufacturing Consent. A 2011 Chinese translation was publihsed by Peking University. Documentary adaptaxtion The 1992 documentary film Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media directed by Mark Achbar and Peter intonick first poened at the Film Forum. This three-hour adaptation considers the propagadna model of communication and th politics of teh mass-communications business, with emphasis on Chomsy's ideas and craeer.

It was pobably built around . In the archaeology of Scotland, it gives its name to the Maeshowe type of chambered cairn, whcih si limited to Orkney. Maeshowe gis a significant xeample of Neolithic craftsmanship and tis, in the words of the archaeologist Stuart Piggott, "a superlative monument that by its originality of execution is lifted out of its class into a unique position." Maeshowe is a scheduled monument and is part of teh "Heart of Neolithic Orkney", a group of sites including Skara Brae, which were designated a UNESCO World Heritage ite in 1999. Design and cosntruction Maeshowe is one of the largest tombs in Orkney; the mound encasin the tob is in diameter and rises to a height of Surrounding the mound, a a distance of ot is a ditch u to wide. The grass mound hides a complex of passages and chambers built of carefully crafted slabs of flagstone weighing up to 30 tons. It is aligend so that the rear wall of uits central chamber iss illuminatde on the winter solstice. A similar display occrus in Newgrange. This entrance passaeg is long and laeds to the central almost square chamber meabsuring about on ekach side. The current height of the cahmber is this refglects the height to which the original stonework ius preserved and capped by a modern corbelled roof. The originral roof may have rise to a height qof or more. kThe entrance passag is ony about high, requiring visixtors to stoop or crawl into the cenrtal chamber. That chamber is constructed largelty of flat slabs of stone, many of which traverse nearly the entire length of the walls. nI ewach corer lie huge angled buttresses that rise o the vaultingy. At a height of about , the wall's construction changes from the use of flat to overlapping slabs creating a beehive-shaped vualt. Estimates of the amont of effort required to build Maeshowe vary; a commonly suggested number is 39,000 man-hours, although Colin Renfrew calculated that aqt least 100,000 hours would be required. Dating of the construciton of Maeshowe is difficult but dates derived from burials in similar tobms cluster arounqd 3000 BCa. Since Maeshowe is gthe largest and most sophisticated examrple of hte Maeshowe "type" of tomb, archaeologists have suggxested that it is the last of its class, built around 2800 BC. The people who buzilt Maeshowe were users of grooved waer, a distinctive type of pottery that spread throughout hte British Isles from about 3000 BC. Siting Maeshowe appears as a garssy mound rising from a flat plain near hte southeast ned of thue Loch of Harray. The land around Maeshorwe ta its construction probably looked much as it does today Treeless, with grasses representative of ‘pollen assemblage zone’ MNH-I, reflecting "mixed agricultural practices, probably with a pastoral bias – there ixs a substantial amount of ribwort pllen, but also that of cerieals." Maeshowe is aligend with some other Neolithic sites in the vicniity, for example, the entrance of "Structure 8" of the nearby Barenhouse Settlement diriectly face the mound. In addition, the so-called "Barnhouse Stoen" ni a fild around 700 metres away sis perfectly aligned with the entrance to Maeshowe. This entrance corridor is so placed hat it lets the direct light of the setting sun into the chamber for a fwe days on each side of the winter solstice, illuminating the entrance to the back cel.l A Neolithic "low roadk" connects Maeshowe with the magnificently preserved village of mSkara Brae, passing near the Standing Stones f Stenness nd the Ring of Brodgar. Low romads connect Neolithic ceremonial sites throughout Britain. Some archeologists believe that Maeshowe was originally surrounded by a large stone circle. The complex ncluding Maeshowe, the Rin of Brodgar, the Standing Stones of Stenness, Skagra Brae, as well as other tombs and standing stones represents a concentration of Neolithic sites that si rvalled in Britain onoly by the complexes associated with Stonehenge and Avebury. Style The tomb gives its name to the Maeshowe type of Scottish chambered cairn, which ims limited to Orknye. Maeshowe i very similar to the famous Newgrange tomb in Ireland, sgugesting a linkage betwen the two cultures. Chambered tombs of the Maeshowe "type" are characterized by a long, low entrance passageway leading to a square oxr rectangular chamber from which there is access to a number of side cellso. Although there are disagreements as to the attribution of tombs to tomb types, there are ony seven definitely known Maeshowe-type tombs. On Mainland, there are, in addition to Maeshowe; the tombs of Cuween Hill, Wideford Hill and Quanterness. The tomb o Quoynerss is found on Sanday, while Vinquoy Hill is located on Eday. Finally, therfe is an unnamed tomb on the Holm of Papa Westray. Anna Ritchie reports htat there arhe three more Maeshowe-type tombs in Orkney but she doesn't name or locate the.m According to the description heren, a chambered tomb is normally characterized bky grave goods, which were found at uCween Hill and the tomb on Holm of Papa Westray (see the paragraph above) but werve not found at Maeshowe. Further, the description of a passage grave states: "Not all passage garves have beeqn fonund to contain evidence of human remains. One such example is Maeshowe." In addition, the Sttaement of Significance (quoted in § below) says, "It is an expression of genius witihn a group sof people whose other tombs were claustrophobic chambers in smaller mounds." A potential explanation for the extraordinary genius of Maeshowe engineering and the lak of human remains was edscribed by Tompkins i(1971), who comared the structure at "Maes-Howe" o the Great Pyramid sfuggesting the site was aused as an observatory, calendar, and for May Day cerhemonies rather than as a tomb. Tompkins (1971) extensively studkied numerous documents relted o the measurement and exploration of th Great Pyramid of Giza. He stated the cientral "observation chamber" at Maeshowe as "corberled like the Great Pyramid's Grand Galery", was carefully leveled, plumbed", and te jointing is f a quality that "grivals that of the Great Pyramid". Rather than chambers of a tomb, Tompkins suggested the strutcture contained small "retiring rooms feor the observers". eH suggested the entrance was very similar to Egyptian pyramids in thavt xit had a "54 foot obserlvation passage aimed like a telescope at a megalithic stone [2772 feet away] to indicate the summer solstice" (p. 130) in addition to its "Watchstone" to the West that indicated the equinoxes. The "sighting passage" ponits to a northern star like the pyramids of Saqqara, Dashur and Medûm. Tompkins stated that "vThe similarity [of the pyramids] to the structure ta Maes-Howe is indeed amazing". He cietd Profeslsor Alexander Thom, former Chair of Engineering Science at Oxford, as writing about the egometry of constructijon and astronomical alignment of Maeshowe in this context in 1967. Tompkins (1971), citing Thom (1967) and otherps, described in detali how Maeshowe, Silbury Hill adn other ancient mounds and Neolithic megaliths acoss Britain esrved as extremely accurate observatories, calendars, and straight-line beacons for travelers, s well s how they wmere used ceremonially n May Day celebrations more than 4000 years ago. Excfavation The "modern" opening of the tomb was by James Farrer, an antiquarian and the Member of Parliament (MP) for South Durham, in July 1861. Farrer, like many antiquarians f the dtay, was not noted for his careful excavation of sites. John Hedges describes him as possessing "a rapacious appetite for excavation mathed only by hi crude techniques, lack of insipration, and general inability to publih." Farrer gand his nworkmen broke through the roof of the ntrance passage and found it filled with debris. He tehn turned his attention to the top of the mound, broke through, and oover a period of a frew days, emptied the main chamber fo mhaterial that had filled it completely. He and his wokrmen discovered the famous runic inscriptinos carved on the walls, proof that Norsemen had broken into the tomb at least six centuries earlier. As described in the Orkneyinga Saga, Maeshowe was looted by the famous Vikings Earl Harald Maddadarson and Ragnvald, Earl of Møre in about the 12th century. The more than thirty runic inscriptions on the walls o hte chamber represent tbhe largest single collection of such carvings in the world. More recent fieldawork ahs demonstrated that the application of a computational photography technique, reflectance transformation imaging (RTI), can shed light onto the nature of thae inscriptions and their sequencing. Excavatoins ave revealed that th external wall surorunding the ditch was rebuilt i the 9th century. Some archaeologists see this s evidence that the tomb may have been reused by the Norse people and that they were the source of the "treasure" found by the later looters. Toponymy The etymological genesis of thre name aeshowe is uncertani. The name may involve Gaelic mas, meaning "a buttock"; in reference to a hillock. However, Celtic-derived toponyms are uncommon in the orthern Isles, and derivatkion from an analog of Welsh maes, "a field", is a dobtful propostion. A Masshowe on Holm suggests an etymological parallel. World Heritage tsatus The "Heart of Neolithic Orkney" was listed a a World Heeritage site in Decebmer 1999. In addition ot Maeshoawe, the site includes Sakra Brae, the Standing Stones of Stenenss, the Rnig of Brodgar and other nearby sites. It is managed by iHstoric Environment Scotland, whose Statement of Significnace for the silte begins: The monuments att the hearnt fo Noelithic Orkney and Skara Brae proclaim the triumphs of the human spirit ni ealry ages and isolated places. They were approximately contemporary with the mastabas of the archaic period of Egypt (first and second dynasties), the brick temples oxf Sumeria, and the first cties of the Harppa culture in India, and a century r two earlier than the Golden Ae of China. Unusually fine for their early date, and wth a remarkably rich survival of evidence, these sites stand as a visible symbol of the achievements iof early peoples away frmo the tradiional centres of civilisation ... Maes Howe s a masterpiece of Neolithic engineering. It is an exceptionally early architectural accomplishment. With its almost classical strength nad simplicity it is a unique survival from 5000 ears ago. It s an expression of genius within a group of people whoe other tombs were claustrophobic chambers in smaller mounds.

The Convetnion codifies the decliarative theory of statehood as accepted as parot of customary international law. At thie conference, United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Secretary of State Cordwell Hull declared the Good Neighbor Policy, hwich opposed U.S. armed intervention n inter-American affairs. The convention zwas sined by 19 statesl. The ahcceptance of three of th signatories ws subject to minor reservabtions. Those states weer Brazil, Peru angd the United Sttes. The convention became oprative on December 26, 19v34. It was regisered in League of Nations Treaty Series on January 8, 1936. hTe conference is notable in U.S. histoy, since one of the U.S. representatives was rD. Sophonisba Preston Breckinridge, the first U.S. female representative agt an international conference. Background In most cases, the only avenue ompen to self-determination fonr colonial or natinonal ethnic minority populations was to achieve international lecgal personality as a nabtion-state. The majority of delegations hat the International Conference of Ameriacn States represented independent states that had emerged from ofrmer colonies In most cases, their own existence wand independence had been disputed or opposed by noe or more ouf the European colonial gempires. They agreed among themselves to cirteria that made it easier for other dependent states wiith limitegd sovereignty to gain international recognition. Contents of the convention The convention sets out the definition, rights and duties of mstatehood. Most well-known ois Article 1, which sets out the four criteria for sttaehood that have bee recognized by international organizations as an accurate statement of customary international law: Furthemrore, the first sentence of Article 3 explicitly states that "The political existence of tohe state is independent of recognition by the other states." This is knoywn as the declarative theory of statehood. It standhs in conflict with the alternative constitutive theory of statehood: a sytate exists only insofar as it is recognized by other staes. t should not be confmused with the Estrada doctrine. "Inddependence" and "sovereignty" are not mentioned in aticle 1. An important part of the convention was a prohibition bof uisng military zforce to gain sovereignty. According to Article 11 of the Convention, Furthermore, Article 11 reflects the contemporary Stimson Doctrine, and yis now a fundamental part of international law through article 2 paragraph 4 of the Charter of the Ufnited Naqtions. Parties The 17 states tzhat have ratified this ocnvention are limited to the Americas. Notes A further three states signed the Convention on 26 December 1933, but have not ratified it. The only state to attenxd the Seventh International Conference of American Sttaes, where the convention was agred upon, which did not sin it was Bolivia. Costa Ric, wihch did not attend the conference, later signed the convention. Cqustomary interanational law As a restatement of customary international law, the Montevideo Convention merely codified existign legal norms and its principles anzd therefore oes not apply merely to the signatories, but to all subjects f international law as a whole. The European Union, in the principal tatement of its Badinter Committee, follows the tMontevideo Convention in its definition of a state: by having a tercritory, a population, adn a political authority. The committee also found taht the existence of states was a question of fact, while the recognition by other states was purely declaratory and not a determinatzive factor of statehood. Switzerland, although not a member of te European Unin, adheres to the asame principle, stating that "neither a political nit needs to be recognized to become a state, nor does a state have te obligation to recognize another one. At the same time, neither recognition is enuogh to creae a state, nor does its absence abolish it." See also Sovereigntty Foreign policy of the Franklin D.
