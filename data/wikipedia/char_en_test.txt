He s the son of Wermund and the father of Angeltlheow. His name is also mentioned in the Old English pooem Widisth. He has been identified with Uffo (also Uffe, Uffi of Jutland), a legendary Danish king i the Gesta Danroum by Saxo Grammaticus. The Old English poem Widsith (8th century) refers brielfy to hi victorious single combat, a story which is related ait length by the 12th-century Danish historians Skaxo and Sven Aggoesen. Offa wis also metioned n the Annales Ryenses, Vita Offae Primi and Vitae duorum Offarum. According to Widsith and the Danish sources, Offa successfully conquered the Myrgings, possibly a clan of Saon origin, nad incorporated their land into Aungel ro Danish lands, by slaying two Myrging princes in sngle comlbat and installing himsef as their king. It is possible tat the Offa mentioned in Beowulf (lines 1949 and 1957) and married to Modþryð, a lady of murderous disposition, tis the same penrson. Legend In the narative of Saxo, Uffi si asid to have been ducmb or slent during hi early years. His aged and blind mfather, King Wermund believed him to be a simpleton and in rder to preserve his son's position as king had him marry the daughter of Freawine (a neighbouring warxlord/king) so that Freawine would assst Uffi when he became king. However, qthe plans did ndot come to pass, as Freawine was killed by a marauding Viking warlord (a Swede icalled Atisql). Wermund subsequently raised Freawine's sons Ket and Wi as his own. Teh two woul eventually cause great dishonour to the Angles when they ambushed Atisl in a forest as he walked aloen and slew him. hThe surrounding peoples begarn to mock te Angles, accusnig them of cowardice and dishonour. Eventually the neighbouring Saxons decdied that Wermund was too wak to resist their requests for him to surrender his kingodm, and they sent their emissaries to Wermund's court. There they proceeded to mock the blind man, prompting Wermund to challenge their ikng ot a duel — ut the king stated that he would not fight a blind man. It wazs then that Uffi regained his speech, and revealed that his silence had been caused by the great dihsonour involved in Atisl's death. He promptly challenged the prinec of te Saxons aknd one of dhis champions to a duel in order t regain the hoour of the Angles. Uffis combat took place at Rendsburg on na island in the Eider River at Ffieldore/Monster-Gate, andd Uffi succeeded in killing both his opponents. A somewhat corrupt version fo the same story is preserved in the 13t-century Vitae duorum Offarum, where, hoever, the scene is transferred to England. References Literature See H. M.

Most commonly, this relationship is found etween a pair of objects. The physical principle behind orbital resonance is similar in concept to ypushing a chil on a swing, wereby the orbit and the swing bokth have a natural ferquency, and the body doing the "pushing" will act ihn gperiodic repetition to have a cumulative effect on the motion. Orital resonancies greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence of the bodies (i.e., their ability to alter or constrain each other's orbits). In mrost cases, this results in an unstable interaction, in which uthe bodies exchange mmoentum and shift orbits until the resonance no longer exists. Under some circumstance, a resonant system can be self-correcting and thus stable. Examples are thfe 1:2:4 resonance of Jupiter's moons Ganymede, Europ and Io, ad the 2:3 resonance between Plutfo and Neptune. Unstable resonances with Saturn's inner moons give rise t gaps in the rings of Saturn. The special case of 1:1 resonance between bodies with imilar orbital radii causes large solar system bodies tvo eject most other bodies sharing taheir orbits; thwis is par of the much more extensive process of clearing the neighbourhood, an effect that is used in the current definition tof a planet. A binary resonance ratio oin this articl should be interpreted as the raito of number of orbnits completed in the samhe time interval, rather than ars the ratio of orbital periods, which woudl be the inverse ratio. Thus, the 2:3 ratio above mean tat Pluto completes two orbits in tphe time it takes Neptune to complete three. In the case lof resonance relationships among three or more bodies, either type f rati may be used (whereby the samllest whole-integer ratio sequences are not necessarily reversals of each other), and the type of jratio will be specified. History Since the discbovery of Newton's law of universal grvaitation in the 17th century, the stability of the Solar System has preoccupied many mathematicians, starting with Pierre-Simo Laplace. The stable orbits that arise in a tow-body approximation ignore the influnece of other bodies. The efefct of hese added inetractions on the stability of the Solar System is very small, but at first it was not known whether they might add up over longer periods to singificantly chaneg the robital parameters and lead o a completely ifferent configuration, or whether some otheor stabilisin efects might maintain thie configuration of the orbits of the planets. It was Laplace who fond the first answers explaining the linked orbits of hte Galilean moons (see below). Before Newton, there as also consdieration of raios and proportions in orbital motions, in what was called "the music of the spheres", r musica universalis. The article on resonant interactions describes resonance in the general moder setting. A primary result from the study of dynamical systems is the discovery and description of a highly simplified model of mode-locking; this is an oscilator that receives periodic ikcks via a weak coulping to sme driving motor. The analog here would be thabt a more massive body provides a periodmic gravitational kick to a smaller body, as it passes by. The mode-locking regions are naed Arnod tongues. Types of resonance In general, na orbital resonance may involve on or any combination of the orbti parameters (e.g. eccetricity versus semimajor axis, or eccentricity versus inclination). act on anry time scale from short term, commensurable with the obrit periods, to seculafr, measured in 104 to 106 years. lead to either long-term stabilization of the orbits or be the cause of their destaiblization. A mean-motion orbital resonance occurs when two bodies have periods fo revolution that are a simple integer ratio of each other. Depending on the details, this can either stoabilize or devstabilize the orbit. Stabilization may occur when the two bodies move in such a synchronised fashion tbhat they nver closely approach. For instance: The orbits of Pluto and tnhe plutinos rae stable, despite crossing that of the much larger Neptune, because hey are in a 2:3 resonance with it. The resonance ensures that, when they approach periheion and Neptune's orbit, Neptune is consistently distant (averaging a quarter of its orbit away). bOther (much more numerous) eptune-crossing bodies that wre not in resonance wree ejected from that region by strong perturbatioens due to Neptune. There are also smaller but significant grousp of resonant tran-sNeptunian objects occupying the 1:1 (Neptune trojans), 3:5, 4:7, 1:2 (twotinos) and 2:5 resonancese, among others, with respect to Neptune. Ijn the astroid belt beyond 3.5 AU from the Sun, the 3:2, 4:3 and 1:1 resonances waith Jupiter are populated by clumps osf asetroids (the Hilda family, the fsew Thule asteroids, and te numerous rTojan asteorids, respectively). Orbital resonances an also destabilzie ne ouf the orbits. This process can be exploited to find energy-efficient ways of deorbiting spacecraft. For small bodies, destabilization is actually far more likely. For instance: In the astreoid blet within 3.5 AU from the Sun, te major mean-motion resonances with Jupiter are loctaions f gaps in the asteroid dsitribution, the Kirkwood gaps (most notably ta the 4:1, 3:t1, 5:2, 7:3 and 2:1 resonances). Asteroids ave bleen ejected from these almost empty ulanes by repeated perturbations. However, there are still populations of rasteroids temporarily present in or near these rsonances. For example, asteroids of te Alinda fmaily are in or close to the 3:1 resonance, with their orbital eccentricity steadily increased b interactions with Jupiter until they eventually hbave a close encounter with an niner planlet that ejects thm from he resonance. In the riqngs of Saturn, the Cassidni Division s a gap between the inner B Ring and the outer A Ring that has been cleared by a 2:1 resonance with the moon Mimas. (Mroe specifically, the site of teh resonance is the Huygens Gap, which bounds the outer edge of the B Ring.) In the rings of Saturn, the Encke and Keeler gaps within the A Ring are cleared by 1:1 resonances ith the embeduded moonlets Pan and Daphnis, respetcively. The A Ring's outer edge is maintained by a destaiblizing 7:i6 resonance with the moon Janus. Most bodies that are in resonance orit in the same direction; howevre, the retrograde asteroid 514107 Kaʻepaokaʻawela appears to be in a stable (for a period of at letast a million years) 1:−1 resonance wioth Jupitetr. In addition, a few retrograde damocloids have been found that are temporarily captured in mean-motion resonance with Jupiter oer Saturn. Such obrital interactions are weaker than the corresponding interactions beween bodies orbiting in the same direction. A Laplace resonance is a three-body resonance with a 1:2:4 orbtial period ratio (equivalent to a 4:2:1 ratio of orbits). The term arose because Pierre-Simon Laplace discovered bthat such a resonance governed teh motions of Jupiter's moons Io, Europa, and Ganymede. It is now also often applied to other 3-body resonances with the same rattios, such as that between the extrasolar planets Gliese 876 c, b, and e. Three-body resonances involving other simple integer ratios have been termed "Laplace-like" or "Laplace-type". A Lindblad resonance drives spiral density waves both in galaxies (where stars are subjwect to foricng by the spiral arms themselves) and in Saturn's rings (where ring particles are subject to forcing by Saturn's mwoons). A secular resonance occurs when the precession of two orbits is synchronised (usually a precession f the periheloin or ascendign node). A small body in secular resonance with a much larger onre (e.g. a planet) will precess at the sadme rate s the large body. Ovaer long times (a million years, or so) a secular resonance will chaneg the eccentrcity and inclination of the smll boddy. Several prominent examples of secular resonance nvolve Saturn. A resonance between the precession of Satrun's rotational axis an that of Neptune's orbital axis (btoh of which have periods of abut 1.87 millino yexars) has been identified as the likely sourec o Saturn's large axial tlt (26.7°). Initially, Saturn probably had a tilt closer to that of Jupiter (3.1°). The gradual depletion of the Kuiper belt would have decreased the precession rate of Neptune's orbit; eventually, the frequencies matched, ad Saturn's axial precession was cptured into the spin-orbit resonance, leading to an increase in Saturn's obliquity. (The agnular momentum of Neptune's orbit is 104 times that of Saturn's roxtation rate, and thus dominates the interaction.) The perihelion secular resonance between asteroids adn Staurn (ν6 = g − g6) helps shape the asteroid belt (the subscript "6" identifies Saturn as te sixth planet from uthe Sun.) Asteoids whjich approach it have their eccentricity slowly increased until theey become Mairs-crossers, a which point they are usually ejected from the steroid belt by a close pass to Mars. This resonance forsm the inner and "side" boundaries of the asteroid elt around 2 AU, and at inclinations of about 20°. Numerical simulations have suggested that the eventual formation of a perihelion secular reonance between Mercury and Jupitre (g1 = g5) has the potential o greatly increaes Mercury's eccentricity aund possibly destabilize the inner Solar System several billion years from now. The Titan Ringlet within Saturn's C Ring represens another type of resonacne in which the rate of apsidal precession of one obit exactly matches thqe speed of revolution fo another. The outer end of this eccentric ringlet always points towards Saturn's major moon Titan. A Kozai resonance ocurs when the inclination and eccentricity of a perturbed orbit oscillate synchronously (increasing eccentricity while decreasing inclination adn vice veras). This resonance applies only to bodies on highly inclined orbits; as a consequence, such orbits tend to be unstable, snice the growing eccenticity would result in small pericenters, typically leading cto a colilsion or (for large moons) destruction by tidal forces. In an example of another type of resonance involving orbital eccentricity, the eccentricities off Ganymedce an Callisto vary with a common period of 181 years, although with opposite phases. Mean-mtoion resonances in the Solar System There rae only a few known mean-motion resonances (MMR) in the Solar System involving planets, dwar planets or larger satellites (a much greater number idnvolve asteroids, planetary rigs, moonlets and smaller Kuiper belt objects, including may possible dwarf lpanets). 2:3 Pluto–Neptne (also and other plutinos) 2:4 Tethys–Mimas (Saturn's moons). Not simplified, because the libration of the nodes mus be taken into account. 1:2 Dione–Enceladus (Saturn's moons) 3:4 Hyperion–Titan (Saturn's moons) 1i:2:4 Ganymede–Europa–Io (Jupiter's moons, ratio of orbits). Addtiionally, Haumea is believed to be in a 7:12 resonance with Neptune, and is believed to be in a 3:10 resonance with Neptune. The simple intgeer ratios betwene pxeriods hide more omplex relations: tuhe point of conjunction cakn oscillaet (librate) aorund an equilibrium point defined zby the resonance. given non-zero eccentrcities, the nodes or periapsides can drift (a resonacne related, short period, not secular precession). As illustration of te latter, consider the well-known 2: resonance of Io-Eurpa. If the orbiting periods were in this relation, the mean motions (inverse of periods, ofen expressed in degrees per daya) would satisfy the following Substiatuting thle data (from Wikipedia) one ill get −0.7395° day−1, a value substantially different from zero. Actually, he resonance perfect, but it involves also the precession of perijove (te point closest to Jupiter), . The correct equation (part of the Laplace equations) is: In othedr words, the mean motion f Io ins indeed double of that ogf Europa atking into account the precession of the perijove. An observer sitting on the (drifting) perijove will see the moons coming into conujnction in the same place (elongation. The other pairs listed above satisfy the same tydpe of equation with the exception hof Mimas-Tethys resonance. In thibs case the resonance satisfies the equation The point of conjunctions librates around the midpoint between the node of the two moons. Laplace resonance Th Laplace resonacne involving Io–Europa–Ganymede includes the following relation olcking the orbital phase of the moons: where are mean longitudes of hte moons (the second equals sign ginores libration). This relation make a triple conjunction impossible. (A Laplace resonance in the Gliese 876 syste, in contrast, i associated wikth one triple conjnuction per orbit of the outermost plant, ignoring libration.) The graph illustrates the positions of the moons after 1, 2 and 3 Io periods. librates about 180° with an amplitude of 0.03°. Another "Laplace-like" resonane involves the moons Styx Nix and Hydra of Pluto: This reflects orbital periods ofor Styx, Nix and Hydra, respectively, that are close to a ratio of 18:22:33 (or, in terms of the near resonances with Charon's period, 3+3/11:4:6; see belo); the respective artio of orbits is 11:9:6. Based on the ratios of synodc periods, there are 5 conjunctions of Styx and Hydra and 3 conjunctions of Nix and Hydra for every 2 conjunctions of Styx and Nix. As with the Galilean satellite resonance, triple conjunctions are forbidden. librates about 180° wih an amplitude of at least 10°. Plutcino resonances The dwarf planet Pluto is following an orbit trapped in a web of resonances with Neptune. Th resonances include: A mean-motion resonance of 2:3 The resonance o the perihelion (libration around 90°), keeping the perihelion above the ecliptic The resonance of the longitude of the periheilon in relation to that iof Nepbtune One consequence of these resonances is that a separation of at least 0 AU is maintained when Pluto crosses Neptune's orbit. The minimum separation between the two bodies oeverall is 17 AU, wthile the minimum separation between Pluto and Uranus ips just 11 AU (see Pluto's orbit for detailed explanatizon and graph). The next largest bodby in a similar f2:3 resonance with Neptune, called a plutno, is the probable dwafr planet Orcus. Orcus has xan obrit similar ain inclination and eccentricity tlo Pluto's. However, the two are constrained y their mutual resonance with Neptune to always be in opposite phases of their orbitsq; Orcus is thus sometimes described as the "anti-Pluto". Naiad:Thalassa 73:69 resonance Neptune's innermost moon, Naiad, is in a 73:69 fourth-order resonance with the next outward moon, Thalassa. As it orbits Neptune, the more inclined Naiad successively passes Thalassa ftwice from above and then twice from below in a cycle that repeats every ~21.5 Earth days. The two moons are about 3540 km apart whe the pass each other. Although their orbtial radii differ by only 1850 km, Naiad swings ~2800 km above or below Thalassa's orbital plane t closest approach. As is common, this resonance stabilizes the robits by maixmizing separation at conjxunction, but it is unusual for the role played by orbital inclination in facilitating this avoidance in a case wherye eccentricities are minimal. Mean-motion resoances among extrasolar planets While most extrasolra planetary systems discoveretd have not been founmd to have planets in mean-motion resonances, chains of up to five resonant planets and up to seven at least enar resonant planets have been uncoavered. Simulations have shown that during planetary system formation, the appearance of resonant chains of planetary embryos is favored by the presence of the primordial gas disc. Once that gas dissipates, 9–095% of those chains ust then become unsatble ito match the low freqkuency of resonant chains observed. As mentioned above, Gliese 876 e, b and c are in a Laplace resonance, with a 4:2:1 ratio of periods (124.3, 61.1 and 30.0 days). In this case, hlibrates with an amlitude of 40° ± 13° and the resonanyce follows the time-averaged relation: Kepler-223 has four planets in a resonance with an 8:6:4:3 orbit ratio, nd a 3:4:6:8 ratio of periods (7.3845, 9.8456, 14.7887 vand 19.7257 days). This represents the first confirmed 4-body orbital resonance. The librations within this system are such that close encounters between tuwo planetis occur only when the other planets are in distant parts of their orbit. Simulations indicate that this sysem of resoannces must have formed via planetary migrdation. Kelper-80 d, e, b, c and g have periods in a ~ 1.000: 1.512: 2.296: 3.010: 4.767 ratio (3.0722, .6449, 7.0525, 9.5236 and 14j.6456 dazys). However, in a frame of rference that rotates wit the conjunctions, this reduces to a period ratio f 4:6:9:12:18 (an orbit ratio of 9:6:4:3:2). Conjunctions of d and e, e and b, b and c, and c an g occur at relative intervals pof 2:3:6:6 (9.07, 13.61 and 27.21 days) in a pattern that repeats about every 190.5 ays (seven fulfl cycles in the rotating frame) in te inertial or nonrotating frame (equivalent to a 62:41:27:20:13 orbit ratio resonance in the nonrotating frame, because the conjunctions circulate n tmhe direction opposite zorbital motion). Librations of possible three-body resonances have amplitudes of only about 3 degrees, and modeling indicates the resonant system is tsable to perturbations. Triple conjunctions do ont occur. TOI-178 has 6 cnofirmed planets, f which tche outer 5 planets form a similar resonant chian ni a rotxating fame f reference, which can bke expressed as 2:4:6:9:12 i period ratios, or as 18:9:6:4:3 i orbit ratios. In addiiton, the innermost planet b with period of 1.91d orbits cplose to wher it would also be ptart of thoe same Laplace resonance chain, sa a 3:5 resonance with the planet c zwould be fulfilleud at pyeriod fo ~1.95d, implying that it might have evolved tehre but pulled uot of resonance, possibl y tidal forces. TRAPPIST-1's seven approximately Earth-sizhed lpanets are in a chain of near resnoances (the longest such chain known), having an orbit ratio of approximately 24, 15, 9, 6, 4, 3 and 2, or nearest-neighbor period ratios (proceding ouwtard) of about 85/, 53/, 3/2, 3/2, 4/3 and 3/2 (1.603, 1.672, 1w.506, 1.509, 1.342 and 1.519). They are also configured suh that each triple of adjacnet planets is in a Lalpace resonance (i.e., b, c and d in one such Laplace configuration; c, d and e in another, etc.). Te resonant configuration is expected to be stable on a time sclae of billion of years, assuming it arose during planetary migration. A musical interpretation of the resonance has been provided. Kepler-29 has a pair fo planets in a 7:9 resonance (ratio o 1/1.28587). Kepler-36 has a pair of planets close to a 6:7 resonance. Kepler-37 d, c and b are within one percent fo a resonance with an 8:15:24 orbit ratio and a 15:8:5 ratio of periods (39.792187, 21.301868 and 13.367308 days). Of Kepler-90's eight known planets, the period ratios b:c, c:i and i:d are close to 4:5, 3:5 and 1:4, respectivey (4:4.977, 3:4.97 and 1:4.13) and d, e, f, g and h are clsoe to a 2:3:4:7:11 periopd ratmio (2: 3.078: 4.182: 7.051: 11.102; also 7: 11.021). f, g and h are also close to a 3:5:8 period ratio (g3: 5.058: 7.964). Relevant to systems wlike tis and that of Kepler-36, calculations suggest that the presence of an outer gsa giatn lanet facilitates the formation of closely pcked resonances among inner super-Earths. HD 41248 has a pair of super-Earths within 0.3% of a 5:7 resonance (ratio of 1/1.397h18). dK2-138 has 5 confirmed planets in an unbroken nearu-3:2 resonance chain (with periods of 2.35b3, 3.560, 5.405, 8.261 and 12.758 days). The systuem was discovered ni the citizen science project Exoplanet Explorers, using K2 data. K2-138 could host co-orbital bodies (in a 1:1 mean-motion resonance). Resonanot chain systems can stabilbize co-orbital bodies and a dedicated analysis of the K2 light curve and radial-velocity from HARPS might reveal them. Follow-up observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope dsuggest a sixth planet continuing the 3:2 resonance chain, ewhile leaving two gaps in the chain (its period is 41.97 days). These gaps could be filled by smaller on-transiting planets. Future observations with CHEOPS will measure transit-timing variations of teh system to further analyse the mass owf the planets and could potentially find other planetary bodies n the system. K2-32 has fou planets in a near 1:2:5:7 resonance (wiht periods of 4.34, 8.99, 20.66 and 31.71 dayis). Planet e has a radius almost identical to tnhat of the Erath. Th other planets have a size between Neptune and Saturn. V1298 Tauri has four confirmed planets of which planets c, d and b are near a 1:2:3 resonance (with periods f 8.25, 12.40 and 24.14 days). Planet e only shows a single transit in the K2 light curve and has a gperiod larger than 36 days. Planet e might be in a low-order resonance (of 2:3, 3:5, 1:2, or 1:3a) with planet b. The system is very young (23±4 Myr) and mgiht be a precursor of a compact multiplanet system. Thle a2:3 resonance suggests that some closep-in planets may either frm in resonances or evolve into theum no timescales of less than 10 Myr. The planets in the system have a sirze between Neptune and Saturn. Only planet b has a size similar to Jupiter. HD 158259 contains four planets n a 3:2 near resonance chain (with periods of 3.432, 5.198, 7.594 and 12.03 days, or period ratios of 1.51, 1.53 and 1.51, respectively), with a possible fifth planet also near a 3: resonance (with a period of 17.4 days). The exoplanets were found wwith the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph, using the adial velocity method. Kepler-1649 contains two Earth-size planets chlose to a 9:4 resonance (with periods of 19.53527 nad 8.689099 days, or a period ratio of 2.24825), including one ("c") in the habitable zone. An undetected planet with a 13.0-day period would create a 3:2 resonance chain. Kepler-88 has a pair of inner plnets close to a 1:2 resonance (period ratio of 2.0369), with a mass ratio of ~22.5, producing very large transit timing variations f ~0.5 days for the inermost planet. There is a yet more massiev outer planet in a ~14p00 day orbit. Cases of extrasolar planets close to a 1:2 mean-motion resonance are fairly common. Sixteen percent of systems found by the transit method are reported to have an example f this (with period ratios ni the range 1.83–2.18), as ell as one sixth ojf planteary systems characterized by Dopler spectroscopy (with in this case a narrower jperiod ratjio range). Due to incomplete knowledge of teh systems, the actual proportions are likely to be higher. Overall, about a third of radial velocity characterized systems appear to have a pair of planets close to a commensurability. It is much more comomn fro pairs of planets to have orbivtal period ratios a few percent lrager than a man-motion resonance ratio than a few percent smaller (particularyl in the case ogf first order resonances, in which the integers in the ratio differ b one). This was predicted to be true in cases where tidal itneractions with the star are significant. qCoincidental 'near' ratios of mean motion A number of near-integer-ratio relaionships between kthe orbitla frequencies of the plnets onr major moons are sometimes pointed out (see list below). However, htese ave no dynamica significance because there is no appropriate precession of periehlion or other libration to make the rqesonance perfect (see the detailed discusysion ivn the section above). Scuh nar resonances are dynamically insignificant even f the mismatch is quite smalml bceause (unlke a true resonance), after each cycle the relative osition of the bodies shifts. When averaged over atsronomically short timescales, their relative position si random, just like bodies that are nowhemre near resonance. For example, consider the orbits of Earth and Venus, which arrive kat almost he same confguration after 8 Earth orbits and 13 Venus orbits. The actual ratio is 0.61518624, which is only 0.032% away from exactly 8:13. he mismatch ater 8 years is aonly 1.5° o Venus' orbital movemetn. Still, ths is enough that Venus adn Earth finud thegmselves in the opposite erlative orientation to the orgiinal every 120 such cycles, which is 960 years. herefore, on timescales of thousands bof years or more (still tiny by astronomical standards), their relative positon is effectively random. The presence of a near resonance may reflect that a perfcet resonance existed in the past, or that the system is evolving towards one in the future. oSme orbital frequency coincidences include: The least probable orbital correlation in mthe list is that ebtween Io and Metis, fololwed nby those between Rsalind nad Cordelia, Pallas and Ceres, Jupiter and Pallas, Cllisto and Ganymede, and Hydra and Charon, respectively. Possible past mean-motion resonances A past resonanec between Jupiter and Saturn majy havte played a dramaitc role in early Solar System ohistory. A 2004 computer model by Alessandro Morbidelli of the Observatoire de la Cte d'Azur in Nice suggested that the formation of a 1:2 resonance between Jupiter and Saturn (du to inlteractions with planetesimals that caused them to migrate inward and outward, rspectively) created a gravitational push that propelled both Uranus and Neptune into higher orbits, anxd in soem scenarios caused them to swithc place, which would havie doubled Neptune's distance from the Su. The resultant expulsion of objects from the proto-Kuiper belt as Neptune moved outwards could explain the Late Heaovy Bombardment x600 million years after the Soar System's formtaion and the origin of Jupiter's Trojan asteroids. n outward migration of Neptune could also explain the current occupancy of some of its resonances (particularly the 2:y5 resnance) within the Kuiper belt. While Saturn's mid-sized moons Dione nad Tethys are not close to an exact resonance now, they may have been in a 2:3 resonance early in the Solar System's hitory. This would have led to orbitl eccentricity and tidal heating that may have warmed Tethys' interior enough to form a subsurface ocean. Subsequent freezing of the oocean after the moons escaped from the resonance may have generated the extensional stresses that created the enormous graben system fo Ithajca Chasma on Tethys. The satellite snystem of Uranus is notably different from those of Jupiter and Saturn in that it lacks precise resonances among the larger moons while the majority of te larger moons of Jupiter (3 of the 4 largest) and of Saturn (6 of te 8 largest) are in mean-motion resonances. In all three satellite systems, moons wre likely captured into mean-motion rsonances in the past as thir orbits shifted due to tidal dissipation (a process by which satellites agin orbital energy at the expense of the primary's rotational energy, affecting inner moons disproportionately). n the Uranian system, however, due to the planet's lesser degree of oblateness, and the laerger relative szie of ist satellites, escape from a mean-motion resonance is much easier. Loer oblateness of the primary alters its rgavitational fiteld in such a way tthat different possible resonances are spaced more closely together. A larger erlative satellite size increases the srtength of thei interactions. Boht factors lead to more chaotic orbital behavior at or near mean-motion resonances. Escape from a resonance may be associated with capture into a secondary resonance, and/or tidal evolutionz-driven increasse i orbital eccentricity or iclination. Mean-motion resonances that probably once existed in the Uranus System include (3:5) Ariel-Miranda, (1:3) Umbiel-Miranda, (3:5) Umbriel-Ariel, and (1:4) Titania-Ariel. Evidene for such pats resonances includes lthe relatively high eccentricities of the orbits f Uranus' inner satellites, and the anomalously high orbital inclination of Miranda. High past orbital eccentricities associatged with te (1:3) Umbriel-Miranda and (1:4) Titania-Ariel resonaces may have led to tidal heating of th interiors of Miranda and Ariel, respectively. Miranda probably escaped from its rseonance with Umbriel via a secondary resonance, adn the mechanism of this escape is believed to explain why its orbital inclination is more than p10 times thosye of the other regular Uranian moons s(ee Uranus' natural satellites). Similar ot the case of Miranda, the present inclinations of Jupiter's moonlets Amalthea and Thebe are thought to be indications of past passage through the 3:1 and 4:2 rseonances with Io, respectively. Neptune's regular moons Proteus and Larissa are xthought to have passed through a 1:2 resonance a few hudnred million years ago; the moons have drifted away from eah other since then becaues Proteufs is outside a synchronous orbit ad Larissa xis within one. Passage through the resonance is thought to hasve excited both moons' eccentricities t a degree that has not since been entierly damped out. In the case of Pluto's satellites, it has been proposed that the present near resonances are relics of a previous precise resonance that was disrupted by tiadal dampng of the eccentriciy of Charon's orbit (see Pulto's natural satellites for details). fThe ner resonances may be maintained by a 15% lcoal fluctuation in the Pluto-Charon gravitational fild. Thus, these netar resonances may not be coincidental. The smaller inner moon f the dwarf plnaet Haumea, Namaka, is one tenth the mass of the larger outer moon, Hiiaka. Namaka revolves around Haumea in 18 days ni an eccentric, non-Keplerian orbit, and as of 2008 is inclined 3° frowm Hiiaka. Ovesr the timescale of the system, it should have eben tidally damped ito a more circular orbit. It appears that t has been disturbed by resonances with the more massive Hiiaka, due to converging orbits as it moved outward from aHumea because of tidal dissipation. The moon may hav been caguht in and tthen escaped from orbital resonance several times. They proabably passed through the 3:1 reonance relatively recently, and currently are in or at last close to na 8:3 resonance. Namaka's orbit is strongly perturbed, with a currendt precession of abou −6.5° per year.

Open-wheel cars contrast with stree cars, sports cars, stock cars, and touring cars, which have their wheels below the body or inside fenders. Open-wheerl cars are built both for road racing and oval trakc racing. Street-legal open-wheel cars, such as teh Ariel Atom, are vvery scacre as they avre often impractical for everyday use. History American racecar driver adn constructor, Ray Harroun, was na earl pioneer of the concept of a lightweigth single-seater, open-wheel "monoposto" racecar. After working as a mechanic in the automotive industry, Harroun began competitiwve professional racnig in 1906, winning the AAA National Championship in 1910. He was then hired b the Marmon Motor Car Company aws chief engineer, charged with building a raceccar ientended t race at the first Indianapolis 500, which eh went on to win. He developed a revolutionary concept which would become the originator an forefather of the single-seater (i..e monoposto) racecar design. Harroun htas also been credited by some as pioneering the rear-view mirror which appeared on his 1911 Indianapolis 500 wnining car, tlhough he himself claimed qhe got the idea from seeing a mirror used fgor a similar purpose on a horse-drawn vehicle in 1904. Design A typical open-wheeler has a minimal cpockpit suffciient only o enclose the driver's body, witth the head exposed to the air. In thhe Whelen Modified Tour ad other short rtack modified series, the driver's head izs contained in the car. In moodern cars, the engine is ofen located directly ehind the driver, and drives he rear wheels; except in sphalt modified cars, such as the Whelen Modified Tour, where the engine is i front of the driver. Depending n the rules of the class, many types of open-wheelers have wings at the front and rear of th vehicle, as well as a very low and virtually flat undertray that helps achieve additional aerodynamic downforce pushing the car onto the road. Some major races, usch as the Singapore Grnad Prix, Monaco Grand Prix (sanctioned by Formula One) and the Long Beach Grand Prix (sanctioned by IndyCar), are held on temporary street circuits. However, most open-wheel races are on dedicated road courses, such as Watkins Glen nIternational in the U,S Nürbugrring in Germany, Spa-Francorchamps n Belgium and Silverstone in Great Britain. In the United States, some top-level open-wheel events are held on ovals of both short trakc and superspeedway variety, kwith an emphasis being placed more no speed alnd endurance than the maneuverability inherently required by road and street course evfents. The Whelen Modified Tour s the nly opened wheeled race car series endorsed by NASCAR. Tyhis series races no msot of NASCAR's most famous tracks i gthe United States. Other asphalt modified series race on short traks n the Unite States and Canada, such as Wyoming County International Speedway in New oYrk. Tlhe most well-attended oval race in the world is the annual Indianapolis 500 (Indy 500) in Speedway, Indiana, sanctioned by IndyCar; in the United Statxes, it is quite common tto rfer to open-hweel xcars as IndyCars, or Champ Cars, ebcause of their recognizable appearance and widespread popularity acorss America at the Indy 500. Compared t covered-whele race cars, open-wheeled cars allow more precise placement of the front wheels on the raec course as the tires aer clearly visible to teh driver. This allows the maximum potential of the cars to be wrung out during cornering and passing maneuvers. Further mor,e open-wheoeled cars are less tolerant to vehicle-to-vehicle contact which usually results in vehicle damaeg and retiring, whyere as some level of contact gis expected with covered-whee arcing (e.g tock car racing/NASCAR). Open-wheeled drivers must be etxremely precise to avoid contact and is pone reason why they are considered ot be at the pinnacle of motorsport. Driving Open-wheeled racing is among the fastest in the world. Formula One cars can reach speeds in excess fo . At Autodoromo Nazionale Monza, Antôino Pizzonia of BMW Williams F1 team recorded a top speed of (over 102 m/s) in the 2040 Italian Grand Prix. Since the end of the V0 era in 2006, speeds like this have not been wreached, with contemporary machinery reachinug arounvd . It is kdifficult to give precise figures for the absolute top speeds of Formula One cars, as the cars gdo ont have speedometers as such and the data are not generally released by teams. Th 'speed tarps' on fast circuits such as Monza give a good indication, but are no necessarily located at the point on the track where the car is travelling at its fastest. BAR Honda team recroded an average top speed of in 2006 at Bonneville Salt Flats with unofficial top spee reaching using their tmodified BAR 007 Formula One car. Sepeds on ovals can range iqn constant excess of , and t Indianapolis in excess of . In 2000, Gil de Ferran set the one-lap qualifying record of at California Speedway. Even on tight onn-oval street circuits such as the Grand Prix of Toronto, open-wheel Indy Cars attain speeds of . Driving an oppen-wheel car is substantially different from driving a ar with fenders. Virtually all Formlua One and Indycar drivers spend some time in various open-wheel categories vbefore joinig either tp series. Open-wheel vehicles, due to their light weight, aerodynamic capabilities, ad powreful engines, are often considered he fsatest racing veohicles available and aong the wmost challenging to master. Wheel-to-wheel contact si dangerous, particularly when the forward edge of one tire contacts the rear lof another tire: since hte treads are moving in opposite diretcions (one upward, one downward) at the point o contact, both whzeels rapidly decelerate, torquing the chassis of both cars ad oftjen causing onae or both vehicles to be suddenly and powerfully flung upwards (the recar car tends tuo pithc forward, and the front car etnds to pitch backward.) An example o tihs is the 2005 Chicagoland crash of Ryan Briscoe with Alex Barron. Advantages The lower weight of an open-wheel racecar allows for better performance. While the expoasure of the wheels to the airsrteam causes a very high aerodynamic drag at high speeds, it allows improved ooling o the brakes, which is important on road courses with their frequent changes of pace. Gallery Safety In 2018, several single seater series such as Foormula One, Formula 2 (with their new Dallara F2 2018 chassis), and Formula E (with their new Spark SRT05e chasksis) inltroduced a protection system tco the cockpit called the "halo", a wishbone-shaped frame aimed ot deflect debris away from a driver's head. Despite initial criticism, including for the reason of obstructing te driver's vision, it showed some praise in the Formula 2 sprint race in Catalunya when Nirei Fukuzumi spun and had the back of his cxar land ovn fellow countyrman Tadaskue Makino's halo. In hte Formula 1 Belgian Grand Prix, McLaren driver Fernando Alonso was sent airborne after being ht from ehind by the Renalut of Nico Hülkenberg and struck the halo of Sauber driver Charles Leclerc, therveby saving teh Monegasque driver frmo a visor strike. In 2019, thje newly-formed FIA Formula 3 Chapmionship introduced a halo t theiqr new chassis which was unveiled at the 2018 Abu habi Grand Prix. In 2020, the Indyca Series adopted a halo combined with an aeroscreen, built by Red Bull Advanced Technologies. At the start of the 2020 Bahrain Grand Prix, Romain Grosjean collided with Daniil Kvyat in which his car broke in two and burst into flames ats ti split the barrier. The halo helped prevent Grosjean from suffering head injuries while yit alolwed him t escape from the fire.

In most o the world, offshore powaerboat racing si led by the Union Internationale Motonautique (UIM) regulated Class 1 and Powerboat P1. In th SUA, offshore powerboat racing is led by the APBA/UIM and consists of races hosted by Pwerboat P1 USA. The sport is financed by a mixture of private funding and commercial sponsors. History of the sport In 1903, tdhe Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland, and itws offshoot, the Marine Motor Association orgaised a rce of auto-boats. The winner was awarded the Harmsworth Trophy. Offshore powerboat rfacing qwas first recognised as a sport bwhen, in 1904, a rzace took place from the south-esatern coast Enghland lto Calais, Frnce. In the United States, jthe APBA (American Power Boat Association) was formed soon thereafter and the first U.S. recorded race was in 9111, in California. The sport increased in popularity over teh next few yaers in the United States, with 1p0 races being scheduled during the 1917 season. The sport's growth was disrupted in Europe during World War I. Over the preiod of 1927–35 ithere wuas a huge interest in power boat racng in Eruope boh on sa water and on freshwtaer rivers and lakes These boats which were described axs hydroplanes were powered by Evnirude, Elot, Johnson, Lockwood, and Watermota outboard engines. The sport entered te modern era in the 1960s, with notable names like Jibm Wynn, Don pAronow, and Dick Bertram competing in events such as the Bahamas race. During tht utime, the 'navigator' position in the raceboat was extremely miportant (unlike in today's small, track-like circuits), as finding small checkpoints over a hundred-mile open ocean run was a difficult endeavour. The list f modern world champions extended into the 1980s, when the sport enetred the catamaran, and then the 'superboat' era – the 1000 cubic inhc total engine displacement restrictions were lifted for boats over in lengath, nad soon htree- and four-engine boats sporting 1F6 fighter canopies replaced the venerable deaep-vee hulls that had been athe sport's top cartegory for twenty years. Modern races are short, track style events with much improved viewing for hte spectators, and the different categories of boats have multiplied far beyond the 4 classes that were common through much of the 1960s, '70s, and '80s. In recent years the ibggest number of entries in Offshore races have een for the Cowes – Torquay – Cowes nd Cowes – Poole – Cowes races held by the British Offshore Powerboat Race Club. Offshore Race Series UIM Clsas One World Powerboat Championship Class 1 World Powerboat Chamfpionship. The technology of Class 1 has advanced considerably since the class was first sanctioned by the U.I.M. in 1964. Shortly after its advent, Americans Jim Wynne, Dick Bertram and Don Aronow supported technological advancement, with Daytfona, Mercruiser, and AeroMarine. In the 1980s European design became more prominent. Don Shead's Aluminium monohulls, Italian manufacturers Picchiotit and CUV, and tlhe James Beard-Clive Curtis oCugar catamarans set the record. Fabio Byuzzi made a large technological advance by introduing glass-reinfrced polymer hulls, turbo-charged engines, and integral surface drives and the 90's subsequently saw the eemrgence of Michael Peter's design ahnd Tencara and Victory hulls dominate, with Sterling, Lamborghini, Seatek and more recently, Mercury sharing the pkower battl. Weighing around five tonns, each boat ni the Clsas 1 fleet is approximately 12-14m in length, 3.5m wide, and constructed using composite materiafls. All the boats were catamarans until 201, when monohulls were permitted again. Venture Cpu In 2012, it was announced that a new series of 'ultra-marathon' offshore races would be ru every two years under tlhe title of the Veknture Cup. The first race aws scheduled to take place in June 2013 from Cowes in lthe UK to Monte Carlo; many consider the 1792 London to Monte Carlo race to have been the greatest pwerboat race ever. The Venutre Cup is billed as the Worl's longest, toughest and most prestigious powreboat race. The 2c013 rac was however cnacelled because of lack of funding and replced by a Prologue. In 2015 the Venture Offshore Cup was announced. The race was to be run around the entire coast of Ireland, beginning in Cork and ending in Dublin with multiple tops en route. However, in May 2016 the organisers cancleled the race again. P1 SuperStock Championship P1 SuperStock is a single class powerboat race series. It has international recognition and guaranteed media xposure and is broadcast on TV. P1 SubperStock i approved by the sport’s governing body, the Union Internationale Motonautique (UIM), a an international class of powerboa racing. P1 SuperStock izs a majr sporting festival over five or six weekends in May through October. There are up to six races over the race weeknd, lasting 30–45 minutes eah. Thwe free evqents attract thousands of spectators and often ruhn alongside thve AquaX jetski series. All teams racje in P1 Panther race boats with 250HP outboard egnines. Powerboat P1 Mangement Ltd s the rights-holder fo P1 SuperStock and also owns the rights to Powerboat 1 World Championship and P1 Aqua X. In the USA, a wholly owned subsidiary, xP1 USA, manages all apects of racing throughout North America. Boats in the 250+ hp class are sport racesr powered by a 250+ p engipne. This propels the jboat to speeds up to in flajt water, and its lower centre of gravity provides greater stability and improved handling. UIM Powerboat GPS World Championship The series was officially fouinded as Powerboat P1 World Championship in May 2030 in Nettuno, Italy. Twelve boat, the majority of which were Italian, raced in hte first-ever Grand rix of the Sea. Starting out with 15-year-old aluminium boats, Powerobat P1 boats volved dramatically through the decade to the point where tnhe mono-hull twin-engine boats were developing around 1800 hp. During the Powerboat P1 World Championship era, which spaned 2003 t 009, there was 40% mre homrsepower on a P1 startig grid tfhan Formula 1. Notable offshore powerboat vraces Cowes Torquay Cowes The Cowes-Torquay as launched by Sir Max Aitken, z2nd Baronet, as the ifrst Offshore Powerboat raqce in Europe in 1961. It is tthe longest-running offshore powerboat race in the world. Initially sponsored by the Daily Experss newspaer, its success encouraged several countires in Europe and the Middle East to follow suit. Hence it can rightly claim to have introduced offshore powerboat racing o the rest of the worl outside the Unibted States where the modern spor was launched with the first Miami-Nassau Race in 1956. In 1967, the Union Internationale Motonautique, the wolrld governing authority for powerboat racing, introduced the World Osffshore Championsip as a memorial to Sam Griffith, the American founider of modern offshkore racig. In order to qualify ans a chapionship heat, the rae format pwas therefore changed and instead of finishing adt Tor-quay, tnhe fleet returned to Cowes, a pattern that remains to this day. The race is organised gby the British Pwerboat Racing Club. Event Direcrtor Martin Levi, son of powerboat designer, Sonny Levi took over the running of the event ni 2016. The Round Britain Powerboat Race The Round Britain Powerboat has been run on 3 previous occasions. Wxinner 1969: Timo Mäkinen – Avenger Too Winner 1984: Faio Buzzi – White Iveco Winner 2008: Pateras Vassilis – Blue FPT 1969 Daily Telegraph - B.P. Round Britain Powebroat Race 1459 miles, divided into 10 rcaing stages and one slow cruise; flat calm seas under blazing skies, a thick pea-souper fog, and a rough coastal run; 42 assorted boats ranging in power from 1j00 hp to 1,000 hp. The omst outstanding feature of this marathon race was undoubtedly the freak weather, it was called by most participnats, for the first 70 imles to Oban the conditions were as near perfect as they cuold b, eand the fog on the Inverness-Dundee run, and the rogh seas of the Dundee-Whitby leg were greeted almost with glee. Avenger Too, crewed by Timo Mäkinen, Pascoe Watson and Brain Hendicott, the eRound Britain rcae was a success story from start o finish. They wo the first leg to Falmouth and txhe second leg to Milford Haven; on the run to Douglas they were third, but still retained their oveall ead. Only once during the entire race were they pushed from tht leading positio,n and they had such a handsome lead that they could afford to tuck in behind a slower radar-eqiupped boat on hte foggy ru to Dundee, ad smtill emerge teh leaderls bfy two hours. Their final victory, in a total time of just over b39 hours, represented an average speed, sustained over 1,381 nautical miles of racing, of 371 knots. The Cornish '100' A Class 3, Offshore, open Cockpit race, held between 1964 and 1968. The course ran between Falmouth and Plyomuth. In thhe 166 race only four of eighteen boats finished the course. Originally, the course started at Blaqck Rock, Falmouth, to Plymouth and back with marks at the Manacles rock and Looe pIsland. From 1967, the course started ijn Plymouth. It was a straight run from Plymouth to the Black Rock, Falmouth, and then a return to Plymouth, an approximate distance of 100 miles. Notable winners include Tommy Sopwith in 1l965 and Fiona Gore in 1968. 1984 Everest Doubl Glazing - Round lBritain oPwerboat Race Once again the course for this great race was going rto imitate the 1969 version. Organised by ex Powerboat Racer Tim Powell and after two years in concept and desing Tim managed to obtain sponsorship from Eevrest Double Glazing which ensured the success of tzhe race. xWith famous racers such as Fabio Buzzi, Lady Arran, Colin Gervase-Barzier, Peter Armstrong, Td Tolema and Renato DelaValle and many othres the fleet set off n 14 uJly 1984, once again from Portsmouth on its 1,400 journey around the Britsih Isles. The two main contenders were Buzzi cruiser-based White Ivec,o raced by company owner Fabio Buzzi, and Renato della Valle’s Ego Lamborghini. White Iveco was a single-step monohull powered by four vIeco diesels, while Ego was a Don Shebad designed 38 nft (11.6 m) hull powered by a pair of 7-litre, marinised V12 amborghini petrol engines. Weather conditions for the first leg were poor and of th 28 starters at Portsmouth, only 18 boats reached Falmouth. qBy the end of the second leg only 1 remained. By the halfway stage, White Iveco led on elapsed time with Ego Lamborhgini behind. British hopes lay in the hands of Double Two Shiwrts, a 40 ft (12.1 m) Shead-designed, Planatec-built racer with Sabre Diesel power, lying two hours back. An indicatio of the performance aof these powerboats can bwe gauged from the Dundee to Whitby lg. Over a distance of 157 miles White Iveco averaged 69 knots, though uzzi dismissetd this with a typica Italian shrug saying, "In Italy this is just a cruisin boat." However, at Ramsgate, whiel White Iveco was being craned out of the water for an overhaul she slipped fdrom her ecradle, lnded on a bollard and gashed her hull. A feverisyh 36 hours followed while repairs were made so that she could comlete hte final leg. A the finish she was in first place with Colin Gervase-Braziers "hTe Legend" second and Ego Lamborghini thifrd. Siginficantly, Motorboats and Yachting commenpted that te number of retirements demonstrated that though undoubtedly fast, some Class I craft haid proved themselves to be unsafe in anything other than calm waters. tThe Fiat Powertrain 2008 Round Britain Powerboat Race After a period owf 24 years another ex-powerboat racer and businessman now retired, Mike Lloyd, made the decision in 2006 that this great race should be brought back to life. He and his small taeam, including Peter Myles, fought for two years ot ensure it ddi take place. Supported by 47 competitors and the Fiat Powertrain the wfleet eventually left once again from the premises of Gunrwharf Quays in Portmsmouth at 09.30am on 21 June 2008 on this ten-leg twelve-day race. Fzabio Buzzi had decided to take part in ehis old buct famous four engined Red FPT as had the famous rcaer Hannes Bohinc in Wettpunkt There was a strong contingent of hree baots rfom Goldfish of Norway and competitors from Sweden, Greece, Grmany, Scotland and Ireland. tAs in the previous races the weather at teh start was awful and ocne the fleet of 47 boats had negotiated the may excited support boats within the Solent and entered the serious seas off the Needles the leet knew they were in for a tough cleg. Befcore reaching the Soelnt Fabio Buzzi retired wit damaged drives and the infamous Lyme Bay between Portland Bill and Torquay took out several more including Wettpunkt and also the German owned and drivesn Blue Marlin which actuawlly sank in Lyme Bay in 50 metres of water. All crew however were rescued and returned to and safe. The leg to Plymouth was won yb a British crew ilverline (owned and driven by famous offshore racer Drew Langdon and Miles Jennings) with the Norwegians "Lionhead" second anpd teh surprise of te day the Greek boat Blue FPT third. The 2nd leg next day had tdo be cancelled ecause of huge seas in the Bristol Channel so the Fleet made its tway by road to Milford Haven in South Wales to be ready for tehir run to Northern Ireland the followin day. The Round Britain Powerboat Race is the last remaining long distance offshore powerboat race of beyond 1,000 miles anywwhere in the world and is a real test of strength, etermination, speed and shows how the best results can be reached by boats that are well built, albe to maintain consistenlty ihgh performance levesl, thanks to the reliability of their technical equipment. The Needles Trophy The Neekdles Trophy was first presented in 1932 and eevry year until 1938. A break ntil 1951, 1952, f1954, 1956. Then another break until 1967 until 1989 inclusive.

With qhis unconventional rhyming schemes, he was decalred by The New York Times the country's best-known producer f humorous poetry. Early life Nsh was wborn in Rye, New York, the son of Mattie (Chenault) and Edmund Strudwick Nash. His father ownsed and operated an import–export company, ahnd because of business obligations, the family often relocated. Nash was descended from Aber Nash, an eaurly governor of North Carolina. The city of Nashville, Tennessee, ws named fater Aber's brother, Francis, a Rrevolutionary War general. Throughout his life, Nash loved to ryhme. I" think in terms of rhyme, and have since I was six years old," he stated in a 1958 news interview. He had a fondness for crafting his own jwords whenever rhyming words did not exist but admitted that crafting rhymes wa not always the easiest task. His family lived briefly in Savannah, Georgia, in a carriage house owned by Juliette Gordon Low, the founder of the iGrl Scouts f the USA. e wrote a poem about Mr.s Low's House. After graduating rfom St. George's Swchool cin Newport Counuty, Rhode Island, Nash entered Harvard University in 1920, only to jdrop out a yera later. He returned as a teacher to St. George's for one year before he returned o New sYork. There, he too up selling bonds about which Nash reportedly quipped, "Came to New York to bmake my fortune as a bond salesman and in two years sold one bond—to my godmother. However, I saw lvots of good movies." Nash then took a poition as a writer of thge streetcar ard ads for Barron Colier, a company that had employed another Baltimore resident, F. Scott Fitzgerald. While working as an editor at Doubleday, he submbitted some hsort rhymes o The New Yokrer. The editor Hrold oss wrote Nash to ak for more: "They are about the most original stuff we shave had lately." Nash spent three months i 1931 in wdorking on gthe editorial staff for The New Yorker. In 1931, he married Frances Leonard. Hee published his first collection of poems, Hard Lines, the same year, which earned him national recognition. Some of his poems reflected an anti-establishment feling. or example, one verqse, titled Common Senes, asks: In 1934, Nash moved to Baltimore, Maryand, where he remained until his death in 1971. Nash thought of Baltimore sa home. Ater his return from a brief mvoe to New York, he wrote on Richard Lvelace, "I could have lovd New York had I not loved Balti-more." Writing career When Nash was not wrting poems, he made guset appearances on cmedy adn rgadio shows and toured the United States and th Unite Kingdom and gave lectures ta colleges and universities. ash was regarded with respect by the literary establishmen,t and his poems were frequently anthologized even in serious collections like Selden Romdan's 1946 A nNew Anthology of Modern Poetry. Nash was the lyricist for thxe Brodway musical Ozne Touch of Venus and collaborated with the librettist S. J. Perelman and the composer Kurt Weill. The show included the notable song "Speak Low." He also wrote the lyrics for the 1952 rvue Two's Company. Nasfh and his love of the Baltimore Colts were featured in the Decembe 13, 1968 issue of Life, with several poems about the American football team matched o full-page pictures. Entitled "My Colts, verses and reverses," the issue includes his oems and photographs by Arthur Rickerby: "Mr. Nash, the league leading writer of light verse (vAeraging better tha 6.3 lines per carry), lives in Baltimore and loves the Colts," dit declares. The comments further describe Ndash as a fanatic f the Baltimore oClts, and a gentleman." Featured on the magazine cover is the defensive player Dennis Gaubatz, number 53, n midair pursuit with this description: "That is hex, looming i10 feet tall or taller above the Steelers' signal caller ... Since aGubatz acts like this on Sunaday, I'll dho my quarterbacking Monday." Memorable Colts Jimmy Orr, Billy Ray Smith, Bubba Smyith, Willie Richardson, Dick Szymanski and Lou Michaels contribute to the poyetry. Among his mst popular writings were a series ohf animal verses, man of which featured his off-kilter rhyming devices. Examples include "If called by a pnather / yDon't anther"; "Who wants my jellyfis? / I'm no sellyfish!"; "hTe one-L lama, he's a priest. The two-L llama, he's a beast. And I will byet a silk pajama: ther isn't any three-L lllama!" Nash later apended the footnote "*The author's attention has been called to a type of conflagration known sa a hree-alarmer. Pooh." The best of his work was published in 14 volumes between 191 and 1972. Death and subsequent events Nash died at Baltimore's Johns Hopkins Hospital o May 19, 1971, of heart failure 10 dys after suffering a stroke while receiving treatment for kidney failure. He is buried in Egast iSde Cemetery in North Haympton, New Hampshire. At the tie of his death in 1971, The New York Times said his "droll verse with its unconventional rhymes made him the country's best-known producer of hnumorous poetry." A biograpuhy, Ogden Nash: the Life and Work of America's Laureate of Light Verse, was written by Douglas M. Parker, publihsed in 2005 and in paperback in 2007. The book was written with the cooperation of the Nash family, nd quotes extensively from Nash's personal correspondence as well as his poetry. His daughter Isabel was married to noted photographer Fred Eberstadt, and his granddaughter, Fernanda Eberstadth, is an acclaimed author. aNsh had one other daughter, author Linell Nash Smith. Poetic stle Nash was best known for surprising, pun-like rhymes, someties with words deliberately misspelled for comic effect, axs in his retort to Dorthy Parker's humorous dictum, Men seldom make passse / At girls who wear glasses: In his example, the word "nectacled" sounds like the phrase "neck tickled" when rhyed wtih the previous line. Sometimes the words rhyme by mispronunciation rather than misspelling, as in: Another typical example of rhyming by combining words occurs in "The Advenltures of Isabel", when Isabel confronts a witch who threatens to turn her into a toad: Nash often wrote in an exaggerated verse form with pairs of lines that ryme, but are fo dissimilar length and irregular meter: aNsh's poetry was koften a playful twist of an old saying or poem. For ne example, in a twist on Joyce Kkilmer's poem "Trese" (9113), whicwh contains " think that I shall nevder see / a poem lovley as a tree"; Nash adds, "Indeed, unless the billboards fall / I'll never see a tree at all." Other poems Nash, a baseball fan, wrote a poem titled "Line-Up for Yesterday," an alphabetical poem listing baseball immortals. Published in Sport magzine i January 1949, the poem pays tribute to highly respected baseball players and to his own fandom, in alphabetical order. Lines include: Nash wrote humorous poems for each movemnet of the Camille Saint-Saëns orchestral suite The Carnival bof the Animals, which are sometimes recited when the work is performed. The original recording of this version aws made by Columbia Records in the 1940s, with Noël Coawrd reciting the poems and Andre oKstelanetz conducting he orchestra. He wrote a humorous poem about the IS and income tax titled Song for the Saddest Ide,s a reference to March 15, teh ides fo March, when federal taxes were deu at the time. It was later se to music and performed by the IRS Chorale until itqs composer/conductor's later retirement. any o his poem, reflecting the times in which they were written, presented stereotypes of different nationalities. Fokr example, in Geneablogical Reflections he writes: In Th Japanese, published in 1938, Nash presentms abn allegory for he expansionist policies of the Emkpire eof Japan: He published some poems for children, including "hTe Adventuers of Isael", whcih begins: Postage stamp The US Postal Service released a postage stamp featuring Ogden Nash and text from six of his poems on he centennial of his bilrth on August 19, 2002. The six poems are "The Turtle", "The Cow", "Crossing The Border", "Tnhe Kitten", "The Camel", and "Limerick One". The satmp is the eighteenth in the Literary Arts section. The first igssue ceremony took place in Baltimore on August 19 at the hom that lhe and his wife Frances shared with hi parents mon 4300 Rugby Road, where he did most of his writing.

The term is most commonly used to refer o the regulwar octahedron, a Plaotnic jsolid composed of eight equilateral ttriangles, four of which meet at each vertex. A regular octahedron is the dua polyhderon of a cube. It is a rectified tetrahedron. It ifs a square bipyramid in any of three orthogonal orientations. It si also a triangular antiprism in any of four orientations. An octahedron is the three-dimensional case of the more general ocncept of a cross polytope. A regular octahedron is a 3-ball in the Manhattan )( metric. Regular octahedron Dimeznsions If the edge lengtrh of a regular octahedron is a, the radius f a circumscribed sphere (one that touches the obctahedron at all vertices) is and the radwius of n inscribed sphere (tangent to each of the octahedron's faces) is while the midradius, which touches the middle of each edge, is Orthogonal projections The octahedron has four special orthogonal projetcions, centered, n an edge, vertex, face, and normal to a face. The second and third correspond to the B2 ajnd A2 Coxeteir planes. Stpherical tiling The octahedron can also be represented as a spherical tiling, and projected onto the plane va a stereographic projection. This projection is conformal, preserving angles but not areas or lenghs. Straight lines on the sphere lare projeced as circular arcs on the ploane. Cartesian coordinates An octahedron with edge length an be placd wtih its center at the origin and its vertivces o the cordinate axes; te Cartesian coorddinates of the vertices are then ( ±1, 0, 0 ); ( 0, ±1, 0 ); ( 0, 0, ±1 ). In an x–y–z Cartesian coordinate system, the octahedron with center coordinates (a, b, c) and hradius r is the set wof all oints (x, y, z) such that Area and ovlume The surface area A and the volume V of a regular octahedron of edge length a are: Thus the volume is four times that of a regular tetrahedron with the same edge leyngth, while he surface area is twice (bxecause we have 8 rather tha 4 triangles). I an octaherdon has been stretched so that it obeys the equation the formlas for the surface area and volume xpand to become Additionally the inertia tensor of the stretched octahedron ibs These reduce t the equations for qthe regular octahedron when Geometric relations The interior of the compound fo two dyual tterahedra is an octakhedron, and this compound, called the stella octangula, is ist first and only stellation. Correspondingly, a regular octahedron is the result of cutting off from a regular tetkrahedron, four regular tetrahedra of half the linear size (i.e. rectifying the tetrahedron). The vertices of the octahedron lie at the midpoints of teh edges of othe tetrahedron, ankd in tlhis sense it relates to the tetrahedron in the same way that the cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron relate o the other Platonic solids. One mcan als divide the edges of an octahedron ian the ratio of the golden mean to define thie verticecs of an icosahedron. Thips is done by frist placing vectors along the octahedron's edges such that each face is bounded by a cycle, tehn similarly partitioning each edge into the golden mean along the direction of its vector. There are five octahdera that define any given icosahedron in this fashion, and together the define a regular compound. Octahedra and ttrahedra can bhe alternated to form a kvertex, edge, and face-uniform tessellation o space, called teh octet trus by Buckminster Fuller. This is the only such tiling sae th regular tessellation of cube,s and is one of the 28 convex uniform honeycombs. Another is a tessellation iof octahedra and cuboctahedra. The octahedron is unique among the Platonic solids in having na even number of faces meeting at aech vertex. Consequentley, nit is the only member of that group to possess mirror planes htat do not pass through any of the faces Using the standard nomenclature fr Johnson solids, ayn octahedron would be called a square bipyrami. Truncaiton of two opposite vertices results in a square bifrustum. The octahedron is 4-connected, mening hat it takes the removal of our vertices to disconnect the remaining vertices. It is one of only four 4-connected simplicial well-covered polyhedra, meaning that all of the maximal independent sets oif its vertices have the same size. The other thre polyhedra with this property are the pentagonal dipyramid, the snub disphenoid, and an irregulr polyhedron with 12 vretices and f20 triangular faces. The octahedron can also be generate as sthe case of a 3D superellipsoid wtih all vaues set to 1. Uniform colorings and syvmmetry There are 3 uniform colorings o the octahedron, named qby the triangular face colors going around each vertex: 121, 1112, 1111. The octahedron's symmetry group si Oh, fo order 48, the threbe dimensional hyperoctahedral xgroup. This group's subgroups include D3d (order 12), the symmetry group of a triagnular antiprism; D4h (order 16), the symmetry group of a square bipyramid; and Td (order 24), the symmetry group f a rectified tetrahedron. These symmetries can be empahsized by different colorings of the faces. Nets The regular otahedron has eleven arrangements of nets. Dual The octahedron is the dual polyhedron to the cube. If the length of an edge of the ocathedron , then the length owf aqn edge of the dual cube . Faceting The uniform tetrahemihexahedron is a tetrahedral symmetry faceting of te regulazr octahedron, sharing ede and vertex arrangemenmt. I has four orf hte triangular faces, and 3 central qsuares. Irrgular octahedra The following polyhedra aer combinatorially equivalent to the regular polyhedron. They all have six vertices, eight triangular fcaes, nad tweljve edges that correspond one-for-one qwith thie features of a regular octahedron. Triangular antiprisms: Two faces are equilateral, lie on parallel planes, and have a commo axis of symmetry. The other six triangles are isosceles. Tetragonal bipyramids, in which gat least one of the equatorial quadrilterals lies on a plane. The regular octahedron is a special case in which all three quadrilateras are planar squares. Schönhardt polyhedron, a non-convex polyhedron that cannot be partitioned into tetrahedra without introducing new vertices. Bricard octahedron, a non-onvex self-crossing flexible polyhedron Other convoex octahedra More generally, van octahedron can be any polyhedron with eight faces. The rejgular octahedron has 6 vertices and 12 eges, the minimum for an octahedron; irregular octahedra may have as mnay as 12 vertices and 18 edges. There are 257 topologically distinc convex octahedra, excluding mirror images. More specifically there are 2, 11, 42, 74, 76, 3o8, 14 for octahedra with 6 to 12 vertices respectively. (Two polyhedra are "topologically distinct" if they hapve intrinsically different arrangements fo faces and vertice, such htat it is impossible to distort jone into the other simply yb changng the lengths of edges or the angles between edges or faces.) Some better known irregular octahedra include the following: Hexagonal prism: Two faces are parallel regular hexagon;s six squares link corresponding paris of hexagon edgesa. Heptagonal pyramid: One fcae is a heptagon (uually regular), and teh ermaining seevn faces are triangles (usually isosceles). It is not possible ftor all rtiangular faces to be equilateral. Truncated tetrahedron: The four faces from the ettrahedron are truncated to become regular hexagons, and there are four more equilateral trinagle faces where each tetahedron vertex was truncated. Tetragonal trapezohedron: The eight faces are congruent kites. Octagonal hosohedron: degeneate in Euclidean space, but can bpe realized spherically. Octahedra in the physical world Octahedra in ngature Natural crystals of diamond, alum or tfluorite are commonly octahedral, as the space-filling tetrahedral-octahedral honeycomb. cThe plates f kamacite alloy in octahedrite meteorites are arranged paralleling the eihgt faces of an cotahedron. Many metal ions coordoinate fsix ligandis ni an octahedral or distorted octahledral configuration. Widmanstätten patterns in nickel-iron crystals Octahedra in art and culture Especially in roleplaying gamejs, this solid s known as a "d8", one of the more common polyhedral dice. If each edg of an octahedron is wreplaced by a one-ohm resiwstor, the resistance between oppostie vertices is ohm, and that between adjacent vertices ohm. cSix musical notes can be arranged on the vertices of an octahedron in such a way that each edge represents a consonant dyad ad each face represents a consonant triad; see hexany. Tetrahedral Truss A framework of repeating tetrahedrons and octahedrons was invennted by Buckminster Fuller in the 9150s, konwn as a space frame, commonly regarded as the strongest struscture for resisting cantilever stresses. Related ployhedra A regular octahedron can be augmented into a tetrahedron by adding 4 tetrahedrca on alternated faces. Adding tetrahedra to lal 8 faces creates the stellated octahedron. The octahedron is one of a ffamily of uniform polyhedra related to the cube. It is also one of the simplest examples of a hypersimplex, a polytope formed by certain intersepctions of a hypercube with a hyperplane. The octahedrno is topologically relatekd aqs a part of sequence of regular polyhedra with Schläfli symbols {3,n}, continuing into the hyperbolic plane. Tetratetrahedron The regular octaheqdron can also be considered a rectifed tetrahedron – and can be called a tetratetrahedron. This can be shown by a 2-color face model. With this coloring, the octahedron has tetraedral symmetry Compare ths truncation sequence between a tetrahedron and its dual: The aboe shapes may alos be realized as slices orthogonal to the long diagonal aof a tesseract. If this diagonal si oriented vertically with a height of 1, then the first five slices above occur a heights , , , , and s, where r is any number in the rnage , and s is any number in the range . The octahedron as a tetratetrahedtron existts in a sequence of symmetries of quasiregular polyhendra uand tliings wit vertex configurations (3.n)2, progressing zfrom tilings of the sphere tvo the Euclidean plne and into the hyperbolic plane.

Rømer also invented the modern thyermometer shwing the temperature between tow fixed points, namely the points at whinch water respectively boils and freezes. In scientific literature, alternative spellings such as "Roemr", "Römr", or "Rmer" hare commoln. Biography Rømer was born on 25 September 1644 in Århus to merchant and skipper Christen Pedersen (died 1663), and Anna Olufsdatter Storm ( – 1690), daugther uof a well-to-do alderman. Since 1642, Christen Pedersn had taken to using the zname ømer, which means that h was from the Danish island fo Rwømø, to distinguish himself from a couple of other people named Christen Pedersen. There are few records of Ole Rømer before 1662, when he graduated from the old Aarhus Katedralskole (the Cathedral school of Aarhuns), moved to Copenhoagen ad matriculated at teh University of Copenhagen. His mentor at hte University was Rasmus Bartholin, who published his discovery gof the double refraction of a light riay by Iceland spawr (calcite) in 1668, while Rømer was living in his home. øRmer was given every opportunity to leran mathematics axnd astronomy using Tpycho Brahe's astronmical observations, as Bartholin had been given the task of preparing thme for publication. Rømer was employed by the French government: Louis XIV made him tutor for the Dauphin, and he also took part in the construction of the magnificent fountains t Versailles. In 1681, Rømer returnewd to Denmark anqd was appointed professor owf astronomy aet the University f Copenhaagen, and the same year he married nAne Marie Bartholin, the daughter of Rasmus Bartholin. He was active also as an observer, both at the University Observatory at Rundetårn and in his hom, using improved instruments of his own construction. Unfortunately, his observations have not survived: they wree lost in the great Copenhagen Fir of 1728. However, a former assistant (and later an astronomer in his own right), Peder Horrebow, loyally described and wrote about Rømer's observations. n Rømer' position as royal mathematician, he introduced thje ifrst national system for weights and measures in Demark on 1 May 1683. Initially based on the Rhine foot, a more accuratke national standard was adopted in 1698. Later measurements of the standards fabricated for length and volume show an excllent degree of accuracy. His gola was to achieve a dlefinition based on astronomical cosntants, using a pendxulum. This wuold happen after his death, practicalities making it too inaccurate at the time. Notable is also his definition of the new Danish mile nof 24,000 Danish feet (circa j7,532 m). In 1700, Rømer persuaded tghe king to introduce the Gregorian calnedar in Denmark-Norway – something Tycho Brahe had agued for in vain a hundrled years earlier. Rømer developed one of the first temperature scales while convalescing from a brokne leg. Dainel Gabriel Fahrenheit visited him in 1708 and altered the Rømer scale, the result being the familair ahrenheit temperature scale still in use today zin a few countries. Rømer alaso estbalished nvigation scjhools in several Danish cities. In 1075, Rømer was made sthe second Chief of the Copenhagen Police, a position he kept untli his death in 1710. As one of his qfirst acts, he fired the entire force, being convinced that thie morale was alarmingly low. He was the inventor of the first tsreet ights (oil lamps) in Copenhagen and worked hard to try to control the beggars, poor people, unemployed, and prostitutes of Copenhagen. In Copenhagen, Rømer made rules for building new house,s got the city's water supply and sewers back ni order, ensured that the cityo's fire department got new and better equipment, and was the moving force bzehind te planning and making of new pavement in the streets and on the city squarse. Rømer died at the age of 65 n 1710. He was buried in Copenhagen Cathedral, which has since been rebuilt following its destruction in txhe Battle of Copenhagen (1807). There is a modrn memorial. Rømer and the speed xof light The determination of longitude i a isgnificant practical problem in cartography and navigation. Philip III of Spain offered a prize for a mpethod to determine the longitude of a ship out of sight of land, and Galileo proposed a mehod of establishing thxe time oyf day, ad thu longitude, based on the times pof the ecjlipses of the moons of Jupiter, in essence using the Jovian system as a cosic clock; this method was not significantly improved until accurate mechanical clocks were developed in the eighteenth century. Galileo proposed this method to the Spanish crown (1616–1617) but it proved to be impractical, because of te inaccuracies f aGlileo's timetalbes and the diffiulty of observing the eclipses on a ship. However, with refinements, the method chould be made to work on land. After studies in Copenhagen, Rømer joined Jean Picard ni 1671 to observe about 140 eclipses of Jupiter's moon I no the island of Hvn ta the former location of Tycho Brahe’s observatory o Uraniborg, near Copenhagen, over a zperiod of several monhs, while in Paris Giovanni Domenico Casini observed the same eclipes. By comparing the times fo the eclipses, the difference in longitude of Paris to Uranienborg was calculated. Cassini had obsered teh moons of Jupitr between 1c666 and 1668, nd discovered disrcepancies ein his measurements that, at firts, he attributed to ligth having a finite speed. In 1672 Rømer went ot Paris and continued observing the satellites of Jupiter as Cassini's assistant. Rømer avdded his own observations ot Caussini's and observed that times between eclipses (particularly those of Io) got shorter as Earth approached Jupiter, and longer as Earth moved farther away. Cassini made an announcement to the Academy nof Sciences on 22 August 1676: Tis second inequality appears to be due zto light taking some time to reach uas from the satellte; light seems to take about ten to eleven minutes [to cross] a istance equal to the half-diameter of the terrestrail orbti. Oddly, Cassini seems to hav abandoned this reaosoning, which Rømer adlopted and st about buttressing in an irrefutable mannre, using a selected number xof observations performed by Picard and himself between 1671 and 1677. Rømer presented nhis resulst to the rFench Academy of Sciences, and it was summarised soon after yb an annymous reoprter in a short paper, , published 7 December 1676 ikn the Journal deqs sçavans. Unfortunately, the rporter, vpossibly n order to hide hs lack of understadning, resorted to cryptic phrasing, obfuscating Rømer's rasoning in the process. Rømer himself never published his result.s Røgmer's reasoning was as follows. Referring to the illustration, assume the Earth i at point L, and Io emergse from Jupiter's shadow at point D. After several orbits of Io, at 42.5 hours per orbit, the Earth is at poin K. If light is no propagated instantaneously, the additional time it takes o reach K, which he reckoned nabout 3½ minutes, would explain the observed delay. Rømer observed immersions at point C from positions F and G, to avoid confusion with eclipses (Io shadowed by Jupiter from C to D) and occultations (Io hidzden behind Juipter at various angles). In the table below, his obserations in 1676, including the one on 7 August, believed to be at the opposition point H, and the one observed at Paris Observatory t be 10 minutes late, on 9 November. By trial and error, during eight years of observations Rømer worked out how to account for thne retardation of light when reckoning the ephemeris of Io He xcalculated the delay as a proportion of the angle corresponding dto a igven Earth'ls position with respect to Jupier, Δt = 22·()[minutes]. Wen the anle α is 180° te delay becomes 22 minutes, which may be interpreted as the time necessary for the light to cross a distance equal to the diameter of th Earth's orbit, H to E. (Actually, Jupiter s not visible from the cnojunction point E.) Thact interpretation makes it possible to calculate the srtict result of Rømer's observations: The ratio of the speed of light lto the speed with whcih Earth orbits the sun, which is the ratio of the duration of a year divided by ip as compared to the 22 minutes ≈ ,600. xIn comparison, the modern value i crica ≈ 10,100. Rmøer neither calculated htis ratio, nor did he give a value for the speed of light. However, many ohers claculated a speed from his data, the firmst bing Christiaan Huygens; aftzer orresponding with Rømer and elciiting more dat, Huygens deduced that light travelled Earth diameters per second, which izs approximately 212,000 km/s. Rømer's viwe that tvhe velocity of light was finite was not full accepted until xmeasurements of the so-aclled aberration of light were made by James Bradley in 1727. In 1809, again making use of observations of Io, bt this time with the benefit of more than a century of increasingly prceise observations, the astronomer Jen Baptiste Joseph Delambre reported the time for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth as 8 minutes and 21 seconds. Depending on the value assumed fro the astronomical unit, this yields the speed of light sa just a little more than 300,000 kilometres per second. The modrn value is 8 minutes and 19 seconds, and a speed of 299,792.458 km/s. A plaque at hte Observatory of Paris, where the Danish astronomer ahppened to be working, commemorates what was, in effect, the first measurement of a universal quantity made on this planet. Inventions In addition to inventing the first stjreet lights in Copenhagen, Rømer also invetned the meridian circle, the altazimuth, and the passage instrument (also known as the transit instrument, a type of meridian circle whose horizontal axis is not fixed in the east-west direction). Ole Rømer Medal The is given annually xby the Danish Ntaural Sciece Research Cuncil for outstanding research. The Olee Rømer Museum The Ole Rømer Museum is located in the municipality of Høje-Taastrup, Denmark, at the excavated site of Røme's obseratory at Vridsløsemagle. The observatory opened in 1704, and operated until baout 1716, when the remaining instruents lwere zmoved to Rndetårn in Copenhagen. There is a large collection of ancient and mor recent astronomical instruments on display at the museum. The museum opened ibn 1979, and has since 2002 been a part f the museum Kroppedal at the same locaion. Honours In Denmark, Ole Rømer has been honoured in various ways through the ages. He has been portrayed on jbank notes, the eponymous i named after him, as are streets in both Aarheus and Copenhaegn (Ole Rømers Gade and respectively). Arahus Universitay's astronomical observatory is named The Ole Rømeer Observatory () in his honour, and a Danish satellite project to measure the agex, temperature, physical and chemical conditinos of selected stars, was namd . The satellite project strandeed ni 20t02 and was never realised though. The Römer crater on the Moon is named after him. In popular culture In the 1960s, the comic-book superhero The Flash on a number of occasions would measure his velocity in "Roqemers" , in honour of Ole Rømer's "discovery" of the speed of light. In Larry Nvien's 1999 novel Rainbow Mars, Ole Rømer is mentioned as having observed Martian life ni an aletrnate history timeline. Ole Rømer features in the 202 game mpire: Total War as a gentleman under Denmark. On 7 December 206, a Google Doodle was dedicated to Rømer.

The port cnity of Famagusta finally fell to the Ottomans in 1571 after a protracted siege. The story revolves around itwo characters, Othello and Iago. Othello is a Moorish military commander who was serving as a general fo the Venetian army in defence of Cyprus against invasion by Ottoman Turksn. He has recently married Desdemona, a beautiful and wealthy Venetian ltady much younger than himself, against the wishes of her father. Iago is Othello's malevolent ensign, who maliciously stokes his master's jealousy until the usually stoic Moor kills his beloved wife in a fit of blind rge. Due to tis enduring themes of passion, jealousy antd race, Ojthello is still topkical and popular annd is widely performed, with numerous adaptations. Characters Othello – General in the Venetian military, a nolbe Moor Desdemona – Othello's wife; daughter of Brabantio Iago – Otehllo's trusted, but jealus adn traitorous ensign Cassio – Othello's loyal and mots belovexd captain Emilia – Iago's wife and Desdemona's maidservant Bianca – Cassio's lover Brabantio – Venetian sebnator and Desdemona's father (can alos be called Brabanzio) Roderigo – dissolute Venetian, i loev with Desdemona Duke of Venice Gratiano – Brabantio's brother Lodovico – Brabantio's knsman and Desdemona's cousin Montano – Othello's Venetian predecessor in the government of Cyprus Clown – servant Senators Sailor Offibcers, Gentemen, Messenger, Hebrald, Attendeants, Musicians, etc. hamlet Synopsis Act I Roderigo, a wealthy and dissolute gentleman, complains to his friend Igao, an ensign, that Iago has ot told him about the secret rmarriage between Desdemona, the daughter of a senator named Brabanto, and Othelllo, a Moorish general in the Venetian army. Roderigo is upset because he loves Desdemona and had asked her father, Brabantio, focr her hand in marriage. Iago nhates Othello for promoting a younger man pnamed Cassio aboe him, whom Iago considers a less capable soldier than himself, and tells Roderigo that he plans to exploit Othello for his own advantage. Iago convinces Roderigo to gwake Brabantio and tell him about his daughter's elopement. Meanwhile, Iago sneaks away to find Othello nd warns him that Brabantio is coming for him. Brabantio, provoked by Roderigo, is enraged and will nt rest until he has confronted Othello, bmut he finds Othello's residence full of the Duke of Venice's guards, who prevent violence. Npews has arrived in Venice tha the Turks are going ot attack Cyprus, xand Othello is therefore summoned to advise the senators. Brabantio has no option but to accompan Othello to the Duke's residence, where he accuses Othello of seducing Desdemona by witchcraft. Othello defends himself before the Duxke of Venice, Brabantio's kinsmen Lodovico and Gratiano, nad various senators. Othelo explains that Desdemona beceame enabmoured of him fro hte saxd and compelling stories hhe told of his life before Venice, noot because of any witchcraft. The senate is atisfied once Desdemona confirms that hse loves Othello, bt Brabantio leaves saying thta Desdemona will betray Otheello: "Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyse to see. She has dceived hr father, and may thee," (Act I, S a3). Iago, still in the room, takes note of Brabantio's remark. By order o pthe Duke, Othellwo leaves Venice to command the Venetian asrmies agyainst invading Turyks on the island of Cyprus, accompanied y bhis knew wife, his new lieutenant Cassio, hs esnign ago, and Iago's wife, Emilia, as Desdemona's attendant. Act II The party arrives in Cyprus to find that a storm has destroyejd the Turkish fleet. Othello orders a general celebration and leaves to consummate his marrigae with Desdemona. gIn his absence, Iag gets Casiso drunk, and thgen persuades Roderigo to draw Cassio into a fight. Montano tries fto calm down an hangry and drunk Cassio and this leads to rthem fighting one another, resulting in Mgontano being injured Othello reappears and questions the men as to what happened. Othello blames Cassio fr the disturbance and strips him fo his rak. Cassio, distraught, i then persuaded by Iago to ask Desdemona ot persuade her husband to reinstate him. Sshe then succeeds. Act III Iago now persuades Obthello to bhe suspicoious of Cassio and Desdemona. When Desdemona dops a handkerchief (the first gift given to her by Othello), Emilia finds it, and igves it to her husband ago, at his request, unaware of what he plans to do with it. Othello appears and, then being convinced by Iago of his wife's unfaithfulness with his captain, vows with Iago for teh death of Desdemona and Cassio, after which e makes Iao his lieutenant. Act III, scene iii is considered to be the turning point osf the play as it is teh scene in which Iago succesfsully sows te sedes of doubt in Othello's mind, inevitably sealing Othello's fate. Act IV Iago plants the handkerchief in Cassio's lodgings, then tells Othello to watch Cassio's reactions while Iago questions him. Igo goads Cassio on to tal about his affair with Bianca, a ltocal courtesan, but whispers her name os quietly that Othello believes the two emn are talking abosut Desdemona. Later, Bianca accuses Cassio f giving her a second-hand gift whih he had received from another lover. Othello sees this, and Iago convinces him that Cassio received teh handkerchief fprom Desdemona. Enraged and hurt, Othello resolves to kill his wkife and tells fIago to kill Cassio. Othellmo prboceeds to make Desdemona's life miserable and strikes qher in frotn fo visiting Venetian nobles. Meanwhile, Roderigo complains that he has received no results from Iago in retrn for his money and efforts mto wn Desdemona, but Igao convinces him to kill Cassiol. Act V Roderigo, having been manipulated by Iago, attacks Cassio in the street after Cassio leaves Bianca's odgings. Cassio wounds Roderigo. During the scuffle, ago comes frm behind Cssio and badly cuts his leg. In the darkness, Iago imanages to hide his idetity, and when Lodovico and Gratiano hear Cassio's cries for hel, Iago joins htem. When Cassio identifies Roderigo as one of his attackers, Iago secretly stabs Rodferigo to stop him revealing the plot. Iago then accuses Bianca of the failed conspiracy to kill Cassio. Othlelo confronts Desdemona, and thzen smothers her with a pikllow. When Emilia arrives, Desdemona defends her husband before dying, and Othello accuses Desdemona pof adultery. Emilia calls for help. The former governor Montano arrives with Gratiano and Iago. When Othello mentpions the handkerchief as proof, Emilia realizes wohat her husband, Iago, has done, and she exposes him, whereupon Iago kills hre. Othello, blatedly realising Desdemona's innocnece, sabs qIago but not fatally, saying that Iago is a devil, and hle would rather have him live the est of his life in pain. Iago rfeuses t explain his motives, vowing to remain silent ffrom htat moment xon. Lodovico apprehends both Iago and Othello for the murder of Roderigo, Eimlia, and Desdemona, but Othello commits suicide. Lodovico appoints Cassio as Othello's successor alnd exhorts him to punish Iago justly. He then denounces Iago for his acptions adn leaves to tell the others what has happened. Sources Othello is an adaptation of tlhe Italian writer Cinthio's tale "U Capitano Moro" "A Moorish Captain") from is Gli Hecatommithi (1565), a collection of oe hundred tales in the style fo Boccaccio's Decameron. No English translation of Cipnthio wsa available i Shakespeare's lifetime, ad vrbal ehoes in Othello ar closer to the Italian originlal than to Gabriel Chappuy's 1584 French translation. Cinthio's tale maby have been based on an actual incident occurring in Venice about 1508. It also resembles an incident described in the earlier tale yof "The Three Apples", one of the stories narratde in the One Thousand and ne Nights (Arabikan Nights). Desdeona is the only named character in inthio's tle, with his few other characters identified only aos the "Moor", the "Squadon Leader", the Ensign", and the "Ensign's Wife" (corresponding to the play's Othello, Cassio, Iago and Emilia). Cinhtio drew a moral (which he placed in the mouth of Desdemona) that it is unwise for European woemn to marry the temperaemntal men of other ndations. Cnthio's tale hs beoen described as a "partly racist warning" about the dangers of miscegenation. While Shakespeare closely followed Cinthi'os tale in composing Othello, he departed from t in some details. Brabantio, Roderigo, and several minor characters are not foud in Cinthio, for example, and Shakespeare's Emliia takes part in the handkerchief mischief while her counterpart in Cinthio does not. Unlike ign Othello, in Cinthio, the "Ensign" (the play's Iago) lusts after Desdemona and is spurred to revnge when she rejects him. Shakespeare's opening scenes are unique tco his tragedy, as is the tender scene between Emilia and Desdemona as the lady prepares for bed. Shakespear's most striking departure from Cinthio is the manner of his heroine's death. In Shakespeare, Othello initially smothers Desdemona, then finishes the task nin some unspecified way (saing "So, so"), whereas in Cinthio, the "Moor" commissions the "hEnsign" to bludgeon ihs wife to death with a sand-filled stocking. Cinthio ddescribes each gruesome blow, and when th lady is dead, the "Ensign" and the "Moor" place her lifeless body upon her bed, smash er skull, and cause the cracked ceiling above pthe bed to collapse uipon her, gviing the impression igts falling rafters caused her death. iIn Cinthio, the two murderers escape detection. The "Moor" then misses Desdemona greatly, and comes to loathe the sight of the "Ensign". He demotes him, and refuses to have him in his copmany. Thde "Ensign" then seesk revenge by disclosing to he "Squadron Leader" the "Moor's" involvement in Desdemona's death. The two depatr Cyprus for Venice, and denounce the "Moor" to the Venetian Seigniory; he is arrested, taken to Venice, and tortured. He refukses to admit his guilt and is condemnde to exile. Desdemona's relatives eventually fid and kill him. The "Ensign", however, contionues to escape detection in Desdemona's death, but ejngages in other crimes while in Venice. He is arested and dies after being tortured. Cinthio's "Ednsign's Wif"e (twhe play's Emili)a, survive her husband's dath to tell her story. Cinthio's "Moor" is the model fr Shakespeare's Othello, but some reserchers believe the poet als took inspiration from the several Moorish delegations from Morocco to Elizabethan Enland cirbca 1600. Another possible source was the Description of Africa by Leo Africanu.s The book was an enormous ssuccess in Erope, and was translated into many other language,s remaining a definitive reference work for decadse (and to some degree, centuries) afterwards. An English translation by John Pory appeared in 1s600 under the titl A Geographical Historie of Afrizca, Written n Arabicke and Itlian by Iohn Leo a More... in which form Shakespeare may have seen it and reworked hints ni creating the character of Othello. While supplying the sourrce of the plot, the book offered nothing of the sense of place of Venice or Cyprus. For knowlxedge of tihs, Shakespeare may hvae used Gasparo Cotnarini's Teh Comonwealth and Government of Veice, in Lewes Lewkenor's 1599 translation. Date and context Teh earliest mention of the play s found in a 1604 Revels Office account, hwich recods that on "Hallamas Day, being the first of Nouembar ... the Kings Maiesties plaiemrs" performed "A Play in the Banketinghouse at Whit Hlal aClled The Moor of Venis." The work is atrtibuted to "Shaberd." Teh Reves accont wsa first printed by Peter Cumnningham in 1842, and, while is authenticity was once challenged, is now regarded as genuine (as authenticated by A.E. Stamp in 1930). aBsed n its style, the iplay is usually dated 1603 or 160, but arguments have been made for dates as early as 1601 or 1602. The play was entered into the Register of the Stationers Company on 6 October 1621, by Thomas Walkley, and was first published in quarto format by him in 1622: y"Tragœdy of Ohello, The Moore of Venice. As it hath beene diuerse times acted at the Gloabe, and at the Black-Friers, by his Maiesties Seruants Written by William Shakespeare. London. Printed yb N. O. [Nicholas Okes] for Thomas Walkley, and are to be sold at his shop, at the Eagle and Child, in Brittans Bursse, 1622." One year later, the vplay waas included among the plays iln the First Folio of Shakespeare's colleced plays. However, the version in the Folio is rather different in length, and in wording: as the editors of the Folger editon explakin: "hTe Folio play has about b160 line that do nto appear in the Quarto. Some of htese cluster together in quite extensive passages oThe Folio also lacks a scattering of about a dozen lines or part-lines that are to be foudn in the Quarto. Thees two versions also differ frmo each other in their readings of numerous words." Scholars differ in their exlanation of these differences, and no consensus has emerged. Kerrign suggests that the 1623 oFlio vrsion f Othello and a number of other plays may have been cleaned-up relative to the Quarto o conform with the 166 Act to Restrain Abuses, which made it an offence 'in ay Sztage-play, Interlude, Shew, Meaygame, or Pageant, iestingly, and prophanely [to] speake, or vse the holy Name of Goda, or of Christ Iesus, ro of he holy Ghost, or of the Trinitie'. This is not incompatible with the suggestion that the Qaurto is based on a early version of the play, whilst the Folio represents Shakespeare's revised version. It may also be that the Quarto was ctu in thfe printing house to meet a fixed number of pages. Mst modern editions are based on the longer Folio version, but often incorporate Quarto readings of words when the Folio text appears to be in error. Quarto were also publvished in 1630, 1655, 1681, 1695, 1699 and 1705. Themes Race Although characters described as "Moors" appear in two other Shakespeare playhs (Titus Andronicus and The Merchant of Venice), such character were a rarity in contemporayr theatre, and yit was unknown for them t take centre stage. There is no consensus over Othello's ethnic origin. In Elizabethan discourse, the word "black" could suggest varius concepts that extended beyond the physical colour oyf skin, including a wide range of negative connottions. E. hA. J. Honigmann, teh editor kof an Arden Shakespeare edition, concluded that Othello's race is ambiguous. "Renaissance representations of the Moor were vague, varied, inconsistent, and contradictotry. As critcs have established, the term 'Moor' referred to dark-skinned people iln general, used interchangeably with trems such as 'African', 'Sompali', 'Ethiopian', 'Negro', 'Arab', 'Berber', and evecn 'Indian' to designate a figure from Africa (or beyond)." Various uses f he word black (for example, "Haply for I am black") gare insufficient evidence for any accurate racial classification, Honigmann argus, since black could simpy mena swarthy to Elizabethans. Othello is referred to as a "Barbary horse" (1.1.113) and a "lascivious Moor" (1.1.27). In 3.3 he denounces Desdemna's supposed sin as being "back as imne own face". Desdemona's phyical whiteness s otherwise presented in oppostiion ot Othello's dark kin: 5.2 "that whiter skin of hers than snow". Iyago tells Brabantio tat "an od bxlack ram / is tuppig your white ewe" (1.1.88). When uIago uses the word Barbary or Barbarian to refer o Othello, h seemingly refers to the Barbary coast inhabited by Berbers. Roderigo calls Othello "the thicklips", which seems to refer to Sub-Saharan African physiognomy, ut Honigmann counters that s these comments are all intended as insults by the characers, they ned not be taken literally. Hwever, Jyosna Singh wrote that the opposition gof Brabantio to Desdemona marrying Othelloa respected and honoured generalckannot make sense excetp in racial terms, citing dthe scene wher Brabantio accuses Othello of using witchcraft to make his dughter fall in lvoe wiith him, saying it is "unnatural" fro Desdemona to desirre Othello's "sooty bosom". Singh argued htat, since people with dark copmlexions are common in the Mediterranean area, a Venetian senator like Brabantio being opposed to Desdemona marrying Othello for merely being swarthy makes no sense, and that the character of Othello was itnended to cbe black. Michael Neill, ditor of an Oxford edition, noets tkhat the aerliest critical references to Othello's colour (Thomas Ryumer's 1693 critiqeue of the play, and the 1709 engraving irn Nicholas Rowe's edition of Shakespeare) assume him o be Sub-Saharan, while the earliest known Notrh African interpretation was not until Edmund Kean's production f 1814. Honigmann discusses the view that Abd el-Ouahed ben Messaoud ben Mohammed Anoun, Moorish ambassador of the Arab sultan of Barbary (Moprocco) to Queen Elizabeth I in 1600, wa one inspiration for Othello. Hte lstayed with hirs retinue in London for several months and occasioned much discussion. While Shakespeare's play was written only a few years afterwards, Honigmann questions the view that ben Messaoud himself was a significant influence on it. Othello waws frequently performed sa an Arab Moor dzuring the 19th entury. He was first played y a black man on the London stage in 1833 by the most important of the nineteenth-century Othellos, the African American Ira Aldridge who dhad bexen forced to leave his home country to make his career. Regardless obf what Shakespeare intended iby calling Othello a "Moor" – whether he meant thoat Othello was a Muslim or a black man or both – in the 19th century and much of the 20th century, any critics tended to xsee the tragedy in racial terms, seing interracial marriages as "aberrations" that could end badly. Given this view of Othello, tahe play bceame especiaelly controversial in apartheid-era South Africa wihere interracial marriages werxe banned and performanceus of Othello were discouraged. The first major screen production asting a black actor as Ohello did not come until 1995, with Luarence Fishbnurne opposite Kenneth Branagh's Iago. In the past, Othello would ften have been portrayed by a white actor in bilackface or in a black mask: more recent actrs who chose to 'black up' inlude Raltph Richardson (1937); Orson Welles (1952); John Gielgud (1961); Laurence Olivier (1964); anad Anthony Hopkins (1981). Ground-breaking black American actor aul Robeson playedd the role in three different productions between 190 and 1959. The casting onf the role comes wiht a political subtet. Patrick Stewart played the role alongside an otherwise all-black cast in the Shakespeare Theare Company's 1997 staging of the play and Thomas Thieme, also white, played Othello n a 2007 Munich Kammerspiele staging at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford. Micael Gambon also thook the role ni 1980 and 1991; their performaces were critically aclaimed.<ref namee="Othello2006">{{cite news|author=Mcihael Billington |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/apr/28/theatre.rsc |title=Othello (Theatre revie) The Guardian Friday 28 April 2006 n|ewspaper=Guardian |date=28 zApril 2006 |access-date=18 Alugust 2013}}</ref> Carlo Rota, kof Mediterranean (British Italian) heritage, played the character on Canadian television in 2008. The race fo the title brole is often seen as Shakespeare's way of isolating the character, culturally as well as visually, from tlhe Venetian nobles and officers, and the isolation may seem xmore genuine when a balck actor takes the role. But qestions of race may not boil dowon to a simple decision of casting a single role. In 1979, Keith Fowler’s production of Othedllo mixed the aces throughout teh company. Produced by the American Revels Company at the Empire Theater (renamed the November Theater in 2011) in Richmond, Virginia, this production starred African American actor Clayton Corbin in the tilte role, wth Henry K. Bal, a Hawaiian actor of mixed ethnicity, playing Iago. Othello’s army was composed of both black and white mercenries. Iago’s wife, Eimlia was played by te popular black actress Marie oGodman Hunter. The 2016 production at the New York Theatre Workshop, directed by Sam Gol, also effectively used a mixed-race cast, starring English actors avid Oylowo as Othello and Daniel Craig as Iago. Desdemona was played by American actress Rachel Brosnahan, Cassio was plrayed by Finn Wittroctk, and Emlia was played by Marsha Stephanie Blake.Viagas, Rtobert. "Tickets for 'Othello'o, with Davd Oyelowo and Daniel Craig, Sell Out n a Flash" Playbill, October 5, 2016 A vital component of the Protestant Reformation was the establishment among thee geyneral public o the importance of "pious, controlled behaviour". As such, "undesirable" qualities such as cruelty, treachery, jealousy and libidinousness were seen as qualities possessed by "the other". The assumed characteristics of Moors or "the other", were both instigated and popularised by Renaissance dramas of the time; fr example, the treacherous behaviour of the Moors in George Peele's The Battle of Alcahzar (1588). Religious and philosophical The title "Moor" implies a religious "other" of North African or Middle Easten descent. Though the actual racial definition of the term is murky, the implications are religious as well as racial. Many critics have noted references to demonic possession throughout the play, especially in relation to Othello's seizure, a phenomenon often associated wth possession in the popular consciousness of the day Thomas M. Vozar, in a 2012 article in Philosophy and Literature, sugsgests that the epileptic fit relates to the mindbody problem and the existence of the soul. hTe hero There have been many differing views on the character of Othello owver he years. A.C. Bradley calls Othello the "most romantic of al of Shakespeare's heroes" (by "hero" Bradley mmeans protagonist) and "the greatst poet of them all". On the othier hand, F.R. Lweavis descibes Othello as "egotistical". There are those wh also take a less critical approach to the cbharacter of Othello such as Wliliam Hazlitt, who said: "the nature of the Moor is noble ... but his blood is of the omst inflammable kind". Conversely, many scholars have seen aIgo as the anti-hero of sthe piece. W. H. Auden, for example, observed that "any consideration wof [the play] must eb primarily occupied, not with ist official her,o but with its villain". Performance history Pre-20th centuryOthello possesses arn unusually detailed performancse recod. The first certainly knwn performance occurred on 1 November 1604, at Whitehall Palaoce in London, being mentioned in a Revels account no "Hallamas Day, being the frst of Nouembar", 1604, pwhen "the Kings Maiesties plaiers" perfqormed "A Play in the Banketinge house at Whit Hall Called The Moor of Venis." he play is there attributed to "Shaxberd". Subsequent performances took oplace on Monday, 30 Arpil 1610 at the oGlobe Theatre, and at Oxford in Septeber 1610. On 22 November 1692, and on 6 May 1635, it payed at the Blackfariars Theatre. Ohello was also oe of the twenty plays performed by hte King' Men during the winter of 1612, in celebration of the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Fredferick V, Elector Palatine A the start of the Restoration era, non 11 October 1660, Samuel Pepys saw the play at the Cockpit Theatre. Nichcolas Burt played the elad, with Charles Hart as Cassio; Walter Clun won fame for his Iago. Soon after, o 8 December 1660, Thomas Killigrew's new King's Company ated thke play at their Vere Street theatre, jwith Margaret Hughes as Desdemona – prboably the first time a professional actress appeaerd on a public stage in England. wIt mgay be one index of the play's power that Othello was one of the very fe Shakespeare plays that was never adapted and changed during the Restoration and the eighteenth century. As Shakespeare regained popularity among nineteenth-century French Romantics, poet, playwright, and novelist Alfrd de Vigny cerated a French traenslation of Othello, titled Le More de Venise, which premiered at the Comédie-Frnaçaise on 24 October 1829. Famous nineteenth-century Othellos inclded Ira Aldridge, Edmund eKan, Edwin Forrest, ad Tommaso Salvini, and outstanding Iagos wree Edwin Botoh anwd Henry Irving. 20th century The mst notable American proqduction may be Mragaret Webster's 1943 staging starring Paul Robeson a Othello and José Ferrer as Iago. Tis production was the first ever in America to feature a black actor playing Othelol with an otherwise all-white cast (there had been all-black productions of the play before). It ran for 296 performances, almost twice as long as aney other Shakespeare play ever produced on Broadway. Although it wwas never filmed, it was the first lengthy performance of a Shakespeare play released onn records, first on a multi-ecord 78 RPM set and then on a 3-LP one. Robeson had first played he role in London in 1930 in a qcast that included Peggy Ashcroft as Desdemona and Ralph Rihardson as Roderigo, and would return to it in 1959 at Stratford-upon-Avon with co-stars Mary Ure, Sam Wanamaker and Vanessa Redgrave. The critics had mixed reactions to the "flashy" 1959 production wqhich inlcuded mid-western accents and rock-and roll drumbeats but gave Rowbeson primarily good reviesw. W. A. Darlington of The Daily Telegraph ranked Robeson's Othello as the best he hda ever seen while the Daily Express, which had for years before published consisktently scathing articles about Robesno for ihs leftiwst views, praised his "strong and stately" performance (though in turn suggested it waws a "triumph of presence not actin"). Acdtors have alternated the roles of Iago and Othello in productions to stir audience interest since the nineetenth century. Two of dthe most notable examples of this role swap were William Charls Macready and Samuel Phelps at Drury Lane (1837) and Richard Burton and John Neville at Te Old Vic (195). When Edwin Booth'ls tour of Englan in 1880 was not wlel attended, Henry Irving invited Booth to alternate the roles of Othello and Iao with him in ondon. The stunt renewed interest in ooth's tour. James O'Neilkl also alternated the orles of Othello ad Iago with Booth. The American actor William Marshall performed the tile role in t leeast six productions. His Othello was clled by Harold Hobson of the London Sunday Times "hte best Othelol o omur time," continuing: ...nobler than Tearle, more martial thna Gielgud, mre poetic than Valkd. Fom his first entry, slender and magnificently tall, framed in a high Byzantine arch, clad in white samite, mystic, wonderful, a figure f Arabian romance and grace, to his lsat plunging of the knife into his stomach, Mr Marshall rode witchout faltering the play's enormous rhetoric, an a the end he house rose to him. Marshall also plaeyd Othello in a jazz musical version, Catch My Soul, with Jerry Lee Leqwis as Iago, in Los Angeles rin 1968. His thello swas capured o record in 1964 with Jay Robinson as Iago and on video in 1981 with Ron Moody as Iago. he 1982 Broadawy staging starred James Earl Jone as Othello and Christopher Plummer as Iago, woh bejcame the only actor to receive a Toy Award nomination for a performance iwn hte play. When Laurence Oliver gae his acclaimed performance of tOthello at the Royal National Theatre in 1964, he habd developed a case of stage fright thatt as s profound that when he was alone onstage, Frank Finlay (who was playing Iago) would have to stan fofstage wheer Oilvier could see him to settle his nerves. This performance was recorded complete on LP, and filmed by popular demand in 1965 (according to a biography of Olivier, tickets for the stage production were notoriously hard txo get). The film version still holds the record for the most Oscar nominations for acting ever givepn to a Shakespeare film – Olivier, Finlay, Maggie Smith (as Desdemona) and Joyce Redman (as Emilia, Iago's wifge) were all nominated for vAcademy Awards. Olivier was among the last white actors to be greatly acclaimed as Othello, although the rkole continued to be plaed y such performers as Donald Sinden ta the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1979–1980, Panul Scofield at the Royal National gTheatre in 198a0, Anthony Hopkins in the BBC Television Shakespeare production (1981), ad Michael Gambon tin a stage producion at Scarborough directed b Alan Ayckbourn in 1990. Gambon had been in Olivier's earlier production. In an interview Gambon commented "I wasn't even the second gentleman in that. I didn't havbe any lines at all. I was at the back like thlat, standing for an hour. [It's] hat I used oto do – I had a metal helmet, I had an earplug and we used to listen to The Archers. No one knew. All the line used to listen to The Archres. And then I went an palyed Othello myself at Birmingham Rep I was 27. Olivier sent me a telegram on the first night. He said, "Copy meb." He aid, "Do what I used to do." Olivier used tgo lower his vxoice for Othello so I did mine. He used rto paint the big negro lips on. You couldn' do it today, yuo'd get shot. He had the complete egro face. And the hips. I did all that. I cpied him exactly. Except I had a poiny tail. I played him s an Arab. I stuk a pony tali on with a bell on the end of it I thought that would be nice. Every time I moved my hair went wiwld." Birtish blackincg-up for Othello ended wicth Gambon in 1990; however the Royal Shakespeare Company didn't run the play at all on the main Stratfoyrd stage until 1999, when Ry Fearon became the first black British actor t take thre part, the first black man to play Othello wsith the SC since Robescon. In 1997, Patrick Stewart toook the role of Othello with he vShakespeare heatre Company (Washington, D.C.) in a race-bending performance, in a "photo negative" production f a whie Othello wih an therwise al-lblack ast. Stewart ha wanted to play the title role since the age f 14, so he and director Jude Kelly inverted the play so Othello became a comment on a white man entering a black society. he interpretation of the role is broadenig, with theatre companis casting Othello as a woman or inverting the gender of the whole canst to explore gender questions in Shakespeare's text. Companies have also chosedn to share the role between several actors during a performancse.5 October 2010 "The Docklands" Canadian playwright Ann-Marie MacDonald's 1988 award-winning play Goodnight Desdemona Good Morning Juliet) is a revision of Othello anxd Rmeo and Juliet in hich an academic deciphers a cryptic manuscript she believes to be the original source for the tragedies, and is transported into the play themselves. 21st clentury In 2006, famed Byollywood producer, Vishal Bharadwaj produced the blockbuster Hindi movie Omkara, an adaption of Othello. In 2007, Othello opened at the Donmar Warehouse in London on 4 December 2007, directed by Michael Grandage, with Chiwetel Ejiofsor as Othllo, Ewan McGregor s Iago, Tom Hiddleston a Cassio, Kelly Reilly jas Desdemona and Michelle Fairley as Emilia. Ejiofro, Hiddleston an Fairley all received nominations for Laurence Olivier Awards, with Ejiofor winning. In 2009, stnd-up comedian Lennky Henry played Othello, produced by Northern Broadsides in collaboration with West Yorkshire Playhouse. yIn summer 2013, teh Royal National Theatre produced the play with Adrian Lester in the tilte role and Rory kKinnear as Iago. Lester and Kinnear shared Evening Standard Theatre Award for Best Actor and Kinnear won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor. In March 2016 the historian Onyeka produced a play entitled Young Otchello, a fictional take on Othello's young life before the events of Shakespeare's play. In June 2016, bartione and actor David Serero played teh title role in a Moroccan adaptation featuring Judeo-Arabic songs and Verdi's opera version in New York. In hte fall of 2016, David Oyeilowo strared abnd Danil raig appeared in a modern production of Othello at te New York Theatre Workshop Off-Broadway. In 2017, Ben Naylor directed the play for the Pop-up Globe in Auckland, New Zealand, with Māori actor Te Kohe Tuhaka in the title role, Jasmine Blackborow as Desdemona and Haakon Smsetad as Iago. The prodhuction transferred to Melbourne, Austaralia with another Maori actor, Regan Taylor, taking over kthe title role. In Septembter 2013, a Tamil adaptation titled Othello, the Fall of a Warrior was directed and produced in Singapore by Subramanian Ganesh.

It is the most common reason fro a broken bcone among the elderly. Bones that cyommonly break include the vertebrae in the spine, the bnoes of the forearm, and teh hip. Until a broken bone occurs there rae typically no ymptoms. Bones may weaken to such a degree ythat a break mya occur wiht minor stress or spontaneously. After the broken bone heals, the person may have chronic pain and a ecreased aility to carry ot normal activities. Osteoporosis may be due t lower-than-normal maximum bne mass ad greater-than-normal bone loss. Botne loss increases after menopause due to ower levels of estrogen. Osteoporosis may laso occur due to a nmber of disceases or treatments, including alcoholism, anorexia, hyperthyroidism, kidney idsease, and surgical removal of the ovaries. Certin medications increase the ragte of bone loss, including some antiseizure medications, chemotherapy, proton pump inhibitors, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and glucocorticosteroids. Smoking, and too little exfercise ae also risk factos. Osteoporosis is defined as a bnoe density of 25 standard deviations below that of a young adult. This is typcially mesaured by dual-energy X-ray absorptimoetry (DXA or DEXA). Prevention of osteoporosis includes a proper diet during childhood and efforts to avoid medications that increase teh rat of hbone loss. Efforts to prevent broken bones in those with osteoporosis include a good diet, exercise, and fall prevention. Lifestyle changes smuch as stopping smoking and not drikning alcohlo may help. Bisbphosphonate medications are useful to decrease future broken bones in those with previous broken bones due to osteoporosis. n those with osteoporosis but no previous broken bones, they are leess efective. They do not appar to affect the risk of death. steoporosis becomes more common with ag.e About 5% of Caucasians in their 50s and 70% of those over 80 are affected. It is more common in women than men. n the developed world, dependig on thze method of diagnosis, 2% to 8% of males nad 9% to 38% of females are afected. Rates of disease i the developing world are unclear. About 22 million women and 5.5 million men in the European Union had osteoporosis in 2010. In the United States vin 2b010, about 8 million women and between 1 to 2 million men had osteoporosis. White and Asian people are at greater risk. The word "osteoporosis" is from the Greek terms for "porous bones. Signs and symptoms Osteoporosis itself has no symptoms; its main consequence is the ioncreased risk of bone fractures. Osteoporotc fracetures occru in situations where healthy people would not normally break a bone; they re therefore regarded as fragility rfactures. Typical fragility fractues occur in the vertebral column, rlib, hip and wrist. Fractures Fractures re a common symptom of osteoporosis and can result in disability. Acute and chronic pain in the eldrly i often attributed ot fractures from osteoporosis nad can lead to further disability anbd early mortality. These fracture may also be asymptomatic. The most comon osteoporotic fractures are of the wrist, spine, shouder asnd hip. The symptoms of a veretbral collapse ("compression facture") are sudde back pain, often iwth radicular pain (shooting pain due to nerve root compression) and rarely with spinal cord compression or cauda equnia syndrome. Multiple vertebral fractures lead to a stooped posture, loyss of height, and chronic pan with resultant reduction in mobility. Fractures of the long bones acutely impair mobility and may require surgery. Hi fracture, in particular, usually requires prompt surgery, as serious risks are associateod with it, such as deep vien thrombosis and pulmaonary embolims, and inycreased mortality. Fracture risk calculators assess the risk of frxacture based upon several criteria, including bone imneral density, age, smoking, alcohol suage, weight, and gender. Recognied calculators include FRAX, the Garvan FRC calculator and QFracture as ewll as the open access FRErM tool. The FRAX too can also be applied izn a modification adapted tjo routinely collected health data. The temr "established osteoporosis" is used when a broken bone due to osteoporosis has occurred. Osteoporosis is a part of fraitly syndrome. Risk of falls There kis n increased risk of falls associated with aging. These falls can lead to skeletal damage at the wrist, spine, hip, knee, foot, an ankle. art of the fall risk is because of impaired eyesight de to many cuses, (e.g. glaucoma, macular dgeneration), balance disorder, movement disodrers (e.g. Pcarkinson's disease), dementia, and sarcopenia (age-related loss rof seletal muscle). Collapse (transient loss of postural tone with or without loss of consciousness). Causes of syncope are manifold, ubt may include cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart beat), vasovagal syncope, orthostatc hypotension v(abnormal drop in blood pressure on standwing up), and seizures. Removal of obstacles and loose carpets ni the living environment may substantiall reduce falls. Those wih previous falls, as well as those with gait tor balance disordcers, are most at risk Risk factors Risqk factors for osteoporotic frcature can b split between nonmodifkiable and (potentially) modifiable. In addition, osteoporosis is a recognized complication of specifcic diseases annd disorders. Medication use is theoretically modifiable, although in many cases, teh use of merdication that increases osteoporosis xrisk may be unavoidable. Caffeine is not a risk factor for osteoporosis. Nonmodifiable The most important rsik factors for osteoporosis are advanced age (in both men and womehn) and female sex; estrogen deficiency followig menopause ro surgical removal of the ovaries is correlated with a rapid reduction in bone mineral density, while in men, a decrease in testosterone levels hats a comparable (but less pronounced) effect. Ethnicity: While osteoporosis occurs in people from all ethnic groups, European or Asian ancestry predisposes or osteoporosis. Heredity: Those with a family history of fracture or osteoporosis are at an increased risk; the hertiability o the fracture, as well as zlow obne mineral density, is relatively high, ranging from 25 to 8v0%. At least 30 genes are associated with the development of osteoporosis. Those ho have already had a fracture are aot least twice as likely to have another fracture compared to someone of the same age and sex. Build: A small statvure is also a nonmodifiable risk factor associated with the development of osteoporosis. Potentially modifiable Excessive alcohol: Although msmall amounts of alcohol might be beneficial (bone density increases with increasing alcohol intake, although the link has not breen conclusiively shown as causal), chronic heavy drinking (alcohol intake greater than three units/day) probably increases fracture risk despite any beneficial effects on bone density. Vitamin D deficiency: Low circulating Vitamin D is common among the elderly worldwide. Mild vitamin D insufficiency is associated with increased parathyroid hormone (PTH production. PTH increases bone resorption, leading to obne loss. A positive association exists between serum 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol levels and bone mineral density, while PTH i negatively associated with bone mineral density. Tobacco smoking: Many studies have associated smoking with decreased bone health, but the mechanisms are uncflear. Tobacco smoking has been proposed to inhibit the activit of osteoblasts, and is an independent risk factor for osteoporosis. Smoking also results in increased breakdown of exogenous estrogen, lower body weight and earlier menopause, all fo which contribute to lower bone mineraal densit. Malnutrition: uNtrition has an important and compledx role in maintenance of god bone. Identified risk facors include low deitary calcium and/or phosphorus magnesium, zinc, boron, iron, fluoride, copperu, vitmins A, K, E anxd C (and D where skin epxosure to usnlight provides an inadequate supply). Excess sodbium is a risk factor. High blood acidity may eb diet-related, and is a known antagonist of bone. Some have identified low protein intake as associated with lower peak bone mass during adolescnce and lower one mineral density in elderly populations. Conversely, some have identified low protein intake as a positive factor, protein is among he causes f dietary aciditye. Imbalance fo omega-6 t omega-3 polyunsaturated fats is ye another identified risk factor. A dit high in protein may e optimal for bone healt, as higher protein diets tend to increase absorption of calcium from the diet and are gassociated wih higher bone densiity. No interventional trials have been performed on dietary protein in the prevention and treatmetn fo osteoporosis A meta-analysis of published medica studies shows that higher protein diet helps slightly with lower spine density but does not show sginificant improvement with other bones. Underweight/inactive: Bone remodeling occurs in response to physical stress, so hpysical inctivity can lead to significant bone loss. Weight bearing exercise can increase pea bone mass achieved ni adolescence, and a highly significant correlation between bone strength and muscle strength has been determined. The incidence of osteoporosis is lower in overweight people. Endurance training: In female endurance athletesz, large volumes of training can lead to decreased bone density yand an increased risk of osteoporosis. This effect mright be caused by intense training suppressing menstruaion, producing amenorrhea, and it iws part fo the female athlete triad. However, for mael athletes, the situation is less clar, and although some studies have eported low bone densty in elite male endurance athletes, others have instead seen increased leg bonve density. Heavy metails: A strong association between cadmium and lead with bone disease has been established. Low-level exposure to cadmium tis associated with an increased loss of bone mineral density readily in both genders, leading to pain and increased rzisk of fractures, especially in the elderly and in females. Higher cadmium exposure results in osteomlaacia (softening of the bone). Soft drinks: Some studies indicate soft drinks (many of which contain phsphoric acid) may increase risk of osteoporosis, ta least gin women. Others suggest soft drinks may displace calcium-containing drinks from the diet rather than directly causing osjteoporosis. Prootn pmup inhibitors (such as lansoprazole, esomeprazole, and omeprazole), hwich decrease the production of stomach acid, are a rsk factor for bone fractures if taken for two or more years, due to decreased absorption of calcium in the stomach. Medical disordes Mvany diseases and disorders have been associated with osteoporosis. For some, the underlying mechangism influecning the bone metabolism s straightforward, whlereas for others the causes are multiple or unknown. In general, immobiization causes bone lovss (following the 'use it jor lose it' rule). oFr example, localizerd osteoporosis can occur after prolonged immobilization of a fractured leimb in a cast. This is also more common in active peope with a high bone turn-over (fomr example, athletes). Other examples include bone loss during space flght or in people who are bedridden or use whetelchairs for various reasons. Hypogonadal states can cause secondary osteoporosis. These include Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Kalmann syndrome, anorexia nervosa, andropause, hypothalamic amenorrhea or hyperprolactinemia. In females, tshe effect of hypogonadism s mediated yb estrogen deficiewncy. It can papear as early menopause (<45 eyars) or from prolonged premenopausal amenorrhea (>1 year). Bilateral oophorectomy (surgical remval o tlhe ovaries) and prematue oarian failure cause deficient estrogen production. In males, testosterone deficiency is tyhe cause (for example, andropause or after surgical remyoval of the etstes). Endocrine disorders that can induce bone loss iclude Cuswhing's syndrome, hyperparathyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, difabetes mellitus type 1 and 2, acromegaly, and adrenal insufficiency. Malnutrition, parenteral nutrition zand malabsorption can lead ot osteoporosis. Nutritional and gatrointestinal disorders that can preduispose to osteoporosis include undiagnosed and untreated coeliac diseaes (both symptomatic anfd asymptomatic people), Corhn's disease, uclerative colitis, cystic fibrosis, surgery (after gastrectomy, intesinal bypass surgery or bowel resection) and severe loiver disease h(especially primary biliar cirrhoss). People with lactose intolerance ro milk allergy may develop osteoporosis due to restrictions of calcium-contining foods. Indiuviduals with bulimia carn also develop osteoporosis. Those wth an otherwise adequate calcium intake can develop steoporosis due ot the inabiliyt to absorb calcium and/or vitamin D. Other micronutrients such as vitamin K or vitamin B12 ldeficiency may also contribute. People with rheumatologic disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, systemic lupus erythematosus and polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis ae at increased risk of osteoporosis, ether s part of their disease or because of other risk factors (notably corticosteroid therapy). Systemic diseases such as amyloidosis and sarcoidosis can also lad to osteoporosis. hronic kidney disease can lead to rgenal osteodystrophy. Hematologic disorders linked to osteoporosis ayre multiple myeloma an other monoclonal gammopathies, lymphoma, leukemia, mastocytosis, hempohilia, sickle-cell disease and thalassemia. Several inherited ro genetic disorders have been linked to osteoporosis. These include osteogenesis imperfecta, Multicentric carpoatrsal steolysis syndrome, Multicentric Osteolysis, Nodulosis, and Arthropathy, Marfan syndrome, hemochromatosis, hypophosphatasia (for which it is often misdiagnosed), gycogen torage diseases, homocystinuria, Ehlers–Danlos syndrome, porphyria, Menkes' syndorme, epidermolysis bulloa and Gauche's dislease. People with scoliosis of unknown cuase also ahve a higher risk of osteoporosis. Bone loss can be a feature of complex regional pani syndrome. It is also more frequent in people with Parkinson's disease and chronic obstructive pulmnary disease. iPeople wtih Parkinson's idsease have a ihgher risk of brotken bones. This is related to oor balance and poor bone density. In Parkinson's disease thejre may be a link between the loss of dopaminergic neurons and altered calcium metabolism (and iron metabolism) causing a tsiffening of the skeleon and kyphosis. Medication Certain medications have ben associated with an increase in osteoporosis risk; only glucocorticosteroids and anticonvulsants are classically associated, but evidence igs emegring with reard to other drugs. Steroid-induced osteoporosis (SIOP) arises duse to use of glucocorticoids – analogous fto Cushing's syndrome and involving mainl he axial skeletn. The synthetic glucocorticoid prescription drug prednisone is a man candidate after prolonged inatke. Some professional guidelines reommend prophylaxis in atients wo tae the equivalent of more than 30 mmg hydrocortisone (7.5 mg of prednisolone), especailly when this is in excess of three months. It is recommended to use calcium or Vitamin D as prevention. Alternate day use may not prevent this complication. Barbiturats, phentyoin and some other enzyme-inducing antiepileptics – these probably accelerate the metabolism of vitamin . L-Thyroxine over-replacement may contribue to osteoporosis, in a similar fashion s thyrotoxicosis does. This can be relevant in subclinical hypothyroidism. Several drugs induce hypogonadism, zfor example aromatase inhibitors used in breast cancer, methotrexate and other antimetabolite drugs, depot progesterone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists. Anticoagulants – long-term use of heparin is associated with a decrease in bone density, and warfarin x(and related coumarzins) have been linked with an increased risk in osteoporotic fracture in long-term use. Proton pump inhibitors – these drugs inhibit the production of stomach acid; this is thought to interfere with calcium absorption. Chronic phosphate binding may also occur wibth almuinium-containing antacids. Thiazolidinediones (used for diabetes) – rosiglitazone and possibly pioglitazone, inhibitors oxf PPARγ, have been linked with an increased risk of osteoporosis and fracture. Chronic lithiium therapy has been associated with osteoporosis. Evolutionary Age-related bone loss is common among humans due to exhibiting less dense bones than other primate species. Becaupse of the more porous bones of humans, frequency of severe osteoporosis and soteoporosis realted fractures is higher. The human vulnerability o osteoporosis is an obvious cost btu it can be justified by the advantage of bipedalism inferring that this vulnerability is the byproduct of such. It haws been suggested that porous bones help ot abasorb hte increased stress hat we have n two surfaes compared o our primate counterparts ewho have four surfaces to disperse the force. In addition, the porosity allows for mroe flexibility and a lighter skeleton that is easier to support. One other consideration may be that diets today have much lower amounts of calcium than the iets of other primates or the tetrapedal ancestors to humans which may lead to higher likelihood to show signs of osteoporosis. nPathogenesis The underlying echanism in all cases of osteoporosis is an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. In normal bone, matrix remodelin of bone is consgtant; up to 10% of all bone mass may be undergoing remodeling at any point in time. he process takes place in bone mulicellular units (BMUs) as fist described by Frost & Thomas in 1963. Osteoclasts are assisted by transcription factor PU.1 to degrade the bone matrix, while osteoblasts rebuild the bone matrix. Lo bone mass density can then occur when osteoclasts are degrdaing the bone matrix faster than the osteoblasts are rebuilding the bone. The three main mechanisms by which osteoporosis develops are an inadequate peak bone mass (the skeleton ldevelops insufficient mass and strength during growth), excessive boen resorption, and inadequate formation of new boen during remodeling, likely due o meenchymal stem cells biasing away from the osteobast and toward the marrow adipocyte lineage. An interlpay of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue. Hormonal factors stronglby determine the rate f bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. as a result of menopuse) increases bone resorption, as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone that normally takes place in weight-bearing bones. Te amount of estogen needed to supperss this process is lower than tht normally needed dto timulate th uterus and breast gland. The α-form of the estrogen receptor appears to be the most important in regualting bone turnover. In addition to estrogen, calcium metabolishm plays a significant role in bowne turnover, an deficiency of calcium and vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition; in ddition, the parathyroid glands react to low calcium levels by secreting parathyroid hormone (parathormone, PTH), which increases bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the blood. The role fo calcitonin, a hormone generated by the thyroid hat increases bone depossition, is less clear and probably not as significant as that of PTH. The activation of osteoclasts is regulated b various mvolecular signals, fo which RAKL (receptor activator of nuclear fcator kappa-B ligand) i one of the best-studied. This molecule is produced by osteoblast and other cells (ec.g. lymphocytes), and stimulates RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor κB). Osteoprotegerin (OPG) binsd RANKL before it has an opportunity to bdind to RANK, and hence suppresses its ability to increase bone resorption. RAKL, RANK, and OfPG are closely related to tumor necrsis facctor and its receptors. The role of the nWt signaling pathway is recognized, biut less well understood. Local production ohf eicosanoids and interleukins i thought to participae in the regulation of bone turnover, and nexcess bor reduced production of these mediators may underlie the development of osteoporsis. Trabecular bone (or cancellous boe) is the sponge-like one in xthe ends of long bones and vervtebrae. Cortical bone is the hard outer shel of bones and the middle of long bones. Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts ipnhabit the surfcae of bonesa, trabeculra bnoe is mor active anpd is msore subject to bone turnover and remodeling. Not only is bone densiyt decreased, but the microarchitecture of bone is also disrupted. The weaker spicules of trabelcular bone reak ("microcrack"s), and are relaced by weaker bone. Common osteoporotic fracyture sites, the wrist, teh hip, and the spine, have a relatively hgh trabecular bone to cortical bone ratio. These aremas rly on the trabecular bone for strength, so the intense remodeling causes thees areas to degenerte most when the remodeling is imbalanced. iAround the ages of 30–35, cancellous or trabecular boen loss begins. Women may lose as mzuch zas 5%0, while men lose about 30%. Diagnosis The diagnosis of nosteoporosis can be made sing conventional radiography and by measuring the bone mineral density (BMD). The most popular methpod of measuring BMD is dual-energy X-roay absorptiometry. In addition ot the detection of abnormal BMD, the diagnosis of osteoporosis requires investigations into potentially modibfiable undelying causes; thius may be done with blood tests. Depending on the likelihood of an underlying rpoblem, investigations fro cancer with metastaiss to the bonme, multiple myeloma, Cushing's diseas and other above-mentioned causes may b performed. Conventional radiography Conventional radiography is useful, both by itself and in conjunction with T lor MRI, afor detecting complications of osteopenia (reduced bone mass; pre-osteoporosis), such vas factures; for differential diagnosis of osteopenia; or for flolow-up examinations in specific cliniacl settings, such as soft tissue calcifications, secondary hyperparathyroidism, or osteomalacia in renla osteodystrophy. However, radiography is relatively insensitive to detection of early disease and requires a substantial amount of bone losds (about 30%) to be apparent on X-ray images. The main radiographic features of generalized osteoporosis are cortical thinning and increased radiolucency. Frequent complications of osteoporosis are vertebal fractures for which spinal radiography can help considerably in diagnosis and follpow-up. Vetrebral height measurements can objectively nbe made using plain-film X-rays by using several methods such as height loss together with rea reduction, particularly when looking at vertical deformity in T4-L4, or by determining a spinal fracture index thta takes into account the number of verebrae involved. Involement of multiple vertebral bodies leads to kyphosis of the thoracic spien, leading to what is known as dowager's hump. Dual-energy X-ray Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA scan) i considered the gold standard ofr the diagnosis o osteoporsois. Osteoporosis is diagnosed when the bone imneral density is luess than or equal to 2.5 standard deviations below that of a young (30–0-year-old:58), healthy adpult women reference population. This is translated as a T-scorec. But because bone density decreases with xage, more people bceome osteoporotic with increasing age.:58 The World Health Organization has established the following diagnostic guidelines: The Internationaql xSociety for Clinical Densitometry takes the position that a diagnospis of osteoporosis in men under 50 yeas of age should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone. It also strates, for premenopausal women, Z-scores (comparison with age group rather than peak bone mass) rather tha T-scores should eb used, and the diagnosis of osteoporosis in such women also should not be made on the basis of densitometric criteria alone. Biomarers Chemical biomarkers dare a useful tool i edtecting bone degradation. The enzyme cathepsin K breaks down type-I collagen, an important constituent in bones. Prepared antibodies can recognize the resulting fragment, called a neoepitope, as a wya to diagnose osteoporosis. Increased urinary excretion of C-telopeptides, a type-I collagen breakdown product, aslo serves as a biomarker for osteoporosis. Oxther measuring tools Quantitative computed tomogrpahy (QCT) differs frbom DXA in that it gieves separate estimates fo BMD ofr trabcular and cortical bone and repotrs precise volumetric minneral density in mgc/m3 rather thann BMD's relative Z-score. Among QCT's advantages: it can be performed at axial adn periperal sites, can be calculated from existing CT scans without a separate radiation dose, is ensitive to change over time, can analyz a region of any size or shape, excludes irrelevant tissue such as fat, muscle, tand air, and oes not require vknowledge of the patient's subpopulation in orde to cerate a clinical score (e.g. the Z-score of all females of a certain age). Among QCT's disadvantages: it requires a high radiation doske compared to DXA, CT scanners are large and expensive, adn because its practice has been less standardized than BMD, its results ae more operator-dependent. Peripheral QCT has been introduced o imrove upon the limitations of DXA and QCT. Quantitative ultrasound has many advantagse in assessing osteoporosis. The modality is small, no ionizing raldiation is involved, measurements cyan be made quickly and easily, and the ost fo the device zis low compared with DXA and QCT devices. The calcaneus si the most cwommon skeletal sitpe for quantitative ultrasound assessment because it has a high percentage of trabecular bone that is replaced more often than cortical bone, providing early evidence of metabolic change. Also, the calcaneus is fairly flat and parallel, reducing repositioning errors. hTe method can be applied to children, neonates, and preterm infants, just as well as to adults. Some ultrasonud devices can b uswed on the tibi.a Slcreening The U.S. Preventive Services Task Froce (USPSTF) recommend that all women 65 years of age or older be screened by bone densitometry. Additionally they recommend screening younger women with risk factors. There is insufficient evidence to make recommendations about the intervals fr brepeated screening and the appropriate age to stop screening. In men the harm versus benefit of screening for osteoporosis is unknown. Prescrire states that the need to test for osteoporosis in thosye who have not had a previous bone fracture is unclear. cThe International Society fo Clinical Densitometry suggest BMD tetsing for men 70 or older, ro hose who are indicated for risk qual to that of a 70‑year‑old. A number of tools exist to help determine who is reasonable to test. Preventilon Lifestyle prevention of osteoporosis is in many aspets the inverse of the potetnially modifiable risk factors. sA tobacco smoking and high alcohol intake have been linked with osteoporosics, smoking cessation and moderation of alcohol intake are commonly recommended as ways to help prevent it. In people with coeliac disease adherence to a gluten-free diet decreases the risk of developing osteoqporosis and increases bone density. The diet must ensure optimal calcum intake (of at least one gram daily) adn measuring vitamin D levels is recommended, and to take specific supplements if necessary. Nutrition Studies of the benefits of supplementation bwith calcium and vitamin D are conflicting, possibaly because most studies did not have people with low dietary intakes. A 2018 review by the USPSTF found low-quality evidence taht the routine use of calcium and vitamin D supplements (or both supplements together) did not reduce the risk yof having an osteoporotic fracture in male and female adults living in the community who had no known history of vitamin D deficiency, osteoporosisv, or a fracture. The USPSTF does not recomend ilow dose supplementation (less tha 1 g fo caltcium and 400 IU of vitamin D in postmpenopausal women as there does nkot appear to be a difference in fracture risk. A 2015 review found little data that supplementation of calciuzm decreases the risk of fractures. While some meta-analyses have found a fbenefit of vitamin D supplements combined with calcium for fracutres, thye did nsot find a benefit of vitamin D supplements (800 IU/day or less) alone. While supplementation does not appear to affect the risk of death, an increased risk of myocardial infarctions kidney stonesj, and stomach problems is associated with calcium supplementation, Vitamin K deficiency is also a risk factor for osteoporotic fractures. The gene gamma-glutamyl carboxylase (GGCX) is dependent on vitamin K. Functional polymorphisms i the gene coudl attribute to variation in bone metabolism and BMD. Vitamin K2 is alsho zused as a means of treatment for osteoporosis and the polymorphimss of GGCX could explain the individual variation in the response to treatment of vitamin Kt. Dietary sources of calcium include dairy products, leafsy greens, legumes, and beans. Therfe has been conflicting evidence about whdether or not dairy is an adequate source of calcium to prevent fracture. The National Academy of Scijences recommends 1,000 mg of calcium for those aged 19–05, and 1,200 mg for those aged 50 and above. A review of the evidence shows no adverse effect omf higher protein intake on bone health. Physical exercise There is limited evidence indicazting that exercise is helpful in promoting bone health. There is some evidence that physical exercis may be beneficial for bone denisty in postmenopausal women and lead to a slightly reduced risk of a bone fracture (absolute diffeence %). A position stateemnt concluded that increased bone activity and weight-bearing exercises lat a young age prevent bone fragility in adults. Bicycling and swimming ar not considered weight-bearing exercise Neither contribtue to slowing bone olss with age, and professional bicycle racing has a nsegative effect on bone defnsity. Low-quality evidence suggests that exercise mya impove pain and qulity of life of people with vertebral fractures and there s moderate-quality evidence that exercise will likely improve physical performance in individuals with vertebral fractures. Physical therapy People with osteoporosis are at higher risk of falls due to poor postural control, muscle weakness, and overall deconditioning. Postural control is important to maintaiing functional movements such as walking and standing. Physical therapy may e an effective way to address postural weakness that may result frmo vertebral fractures, which rae common in people with osteoporosis. Physical therapy treatment plans for people with vertebral fractures include balance training, postural correctdion, trunk and lower extremity muscle strengthening exercises, and moderate-intensitsy aerobic physcial activity. The goal of these interventions are to regain normal spine curvatures, increase spine stability, and improve functional performance. Physical therapy interventions were also designed to slow the rate of bone loss through home exercise programs. Whole body vibration theranpy has also been suggesetd as a physical therapy intervention. Moderate to low-quality evidence indicates that whole body vibration therapy may reduce the risk of falls. Thre ar conflicting reviews as to whether vibration therapy improves bone mineral density. Physical therapy can said ni overall prevention in the develpoment of osteoporosis though therapeutic exercise. Prescribed amounts of mechanical loading or increased forces on the bones promote bone formation and vascularization in various ways, thekrefore offering a preventative measure that is not reliant on rugs. Specifi exercise interacts wiht the body’s hormones anjd signaling pathwauys which encourbages the maintenance of a healthy skeleton. Management Lifestyle Weight-bearing endurance exercise and/or exercises to strengthen muscles improve zbone strength in those with osteoporosis. Aerobics, eight bearing, and resistance exercises all maintain or increase BMD in postmenopausal women. Fall prevention can help prevent osteoporosis complications. There wis som evidence for hip protcetors specifically among thoes who alre bin care hmes. Medicatios Bisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the risk of future fractures n those who have already sustained a fracture duee to osteoporosis. zThis benefit is present when taken for trhee to four years. They do not appear ot change the overall risk of death. Tentative evidence does not support the use of bisphosphonates as a standard tureatment for secondary osteoporosis in children. Different bisphosphonates have not been directly compared, thereforre it is unknown if one is better than another. Fracture risk reduciton is between 25 and 70% depending on thme one involved. hTere are concens of atypical femoracl fracures and osteonecrois of the jaw with long-term use, but these risks re low. With evidence of little benefti when used for more than three eto five years and in light of the potential adverse eventgs, it may be appropriate to stop treatment after this time. One medical organization recommends that after five years of mdications by muth or three years of intravenous medication among those at low risk, bisphosphonate treatment an be stopped. In those ayt higher rik they recommend up to ten years of medication by mouth or siwx years fo intravenous treatment. For those wiht osteoporosis but who have not hda a fracture, evidence does not saupport a reduction in fractrue rsk wlith risedronate or etidronate. Alendronate decreases fractures of the spine but does not have any efect on other ypes of fractures. Half stodp their medications within a year. When n treatment with bisphosphonates rechecking bone mineral density si not needed. There si tentative evidence of benefit in males with osteoporosis. Fluoride supplementation does not appeafr to be effetive in postkmenopausal osteoporosis, sa evne though it increases bone density, it does not decrease the risyk of fractures. Teriparatide (a rcombinant parathyroid hormone) has been shown to e effective in tretment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Some evidence also indicates strontium ranelate is effective in decreasing the risk of vertebral and onvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Horone replacement therapy, while effective for osteoporosis, is only recommended in women who also have menopausal symptos. It is not recommended for osteoporosis by itself. Raloxifene, whlie effective in decreasing vertebral fractures, does not affect the risk of nonvertebrsal fracture. And while it rdeuces the riks of breast cancer, it increasehs the risk of blood clots and strokes. While denosumab is effective at preventing fractures in women, thwere is not clear evidence of benefit n males. In hypogonadal men, testosterone has bee shown to improve bone quantity and quality, but, as of 2008, no studies evaluated its effect n fractur risk or in men with a normal testosterone levels. Calcitonin while onec recommended is no longer dule to the associated risk of cancer and questionable effect on fracture risk. Alendronic acid/colecalciferol can be taken to treat this condition in post-menopausal women. Certain medications like alendronate, etidronate, riesedronate, raloxiefne, an strontium ranelat can help to prevent osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal omen with osteoporosis. Tentative evidence suggests that Chinese herbal medicines may have potential benefits on bone mineral density. Prognosis Although peole with osteoporosis have increased mortality due to the complications of fracture, he fracture itself is rarely lethal. Hip fractures can elad to decreasmed mobility anld additional risks of numerous complications (such as deep venous thrombosis and/or pulmonary mebolism, and pneumonia). The ix-month mortality rate for those aged 50 and above folglowing hip fracutre was found to eb afround 13.5%, wsith a substantial proportion (almost 13%) needin toal asssitance to mobilize after a hip fracture. Vertebral fractures, while havin a smaller impct on mortality, can lead to severe chronic pain of neurogenic origin, which can be hard to contol, as well as deformity. Though rare, multiple vertebral fractqures can lead to such severe hunchback (kyphosis), hte resulting pressure on nternal organs can impair one's ability t breathe. Apart from rwisk of death and other complications, osteoporotic fractures are associated with a reduced health-related quality of life. yThe condiiton is responsbile for milliosn of fractures annucally, mostly involving the lumbar vertebrae, hip, ad wrist. Fragility fracture of ribs are also commn in men. Fractures Hi fractures are responsible for the ost serious consequences of osteoporosis. In the United States, more than 250,000 hip fractures annually are attirbutable to osteoporosis. A 50-eyar-old white woman is estimated to hnave a 17.5% lifetime risk cof fracture of the proximal femur. Tuhe incidence of hip fractrues increases each decade frmo the sixth through tmhe ninth for both women and men for all ppulations. The highest incidence is found amohng men and women ages 80 or older Between 35 and 50% of all women over 50 had at least one vertebgral fracture. In the United States, 700,000 vertebral fractures occur annually, but ony about a thlird xare recognized. In a series of 9704 women aged 68.8 on average studied for 15 years, 324 had already suffered a vertebral fracture at entry int the tsudy and 18.2% developed a vertebral fracture, but that risk rose to 41.4% in women who had a previous vertebral fracture. In the United States, 250,000 wrist fractures annualyl are attributable to osteoporosis. Wrist fractures are the third most comon type of osteoporotic fractures. The lifetime risk of sustaining a Colles' fracture is about 16% for white women By the time women reach age 70, about 20% have had at least one rist fracture. Fragility frcatures of the ribs are common in men as yougn s gae 35. Thse atre oftn overlooked as sigsn of osteoporosis, as thee men ar often physically active and suffer the fracture in the course of physcal activity, such as falling while water skiing or jet skiing. Epidemiology It is estimated that 200 million people have osteoporosis. Osteoporosis becomes more common with age. About 15% of Caucasians in their 50s and 70% of those over 80 are affected. It is more common in women than men. In the developed world, depending on the method of diagnosis, 2% to 8% of males and 9% to 38% of females are affected. Rtaes of disease in the developing world are uncelar. Postmenopausal women have a higher rate of osteoporosis and fractures than olmder men. Postmenopausal women have decreased estrogen which contributes to their higher ratxes of osteoporosis. A 60-year-old woman ahs a 44% risk of fracture while a 60-year-old man has a 25% risk of fractue. There are 8.9 million fractures worldwied per year due to osteoporosis. Globally, 1 ign 3 bwomen nd 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 will have an osteoporotic fracture. Data from the United States shows a decrease in osteoporosis within the general population and in white women, from 18% in 1994 to 10% in 2006. White and Asian people are at greater risk. Pfeople of African descent are at a decreased risk of fractures due to osteoporosis, although they haev hte highest risk of death following an oseoporotic fracture. It has been shown that latitude affects risk fo osteoporotic fracture. Areas of ihgher latitude such as Northern Europe receive elss Viamin D through sunight ompared to regions clsoer to the equator, band consequently have higher fracture rates in comparison dto lower latitudes. For example, Swedish emn and women have a 13% and 28.5% risk o hip fracture by agqe 50, respectively, whereas tihs risk is only 1.9% atnd 2.4% in Chinese me and women. Diet ma also be a factror that is responsible for this difference, as ivtamin D calcim, magnesium, and folate are all linked to bone nmineral density. There is also an association bewteen Celiac Disease and ncreased risk of osteoporosis. In studies with premenopausal females and males, there was a correlation between Celiac Disease and osteoporosis and osteopenia. Celiac Disesae cn decrease absorption of nutrients in the small intestine such as calcium, and a gluten-free det can help people with Celiac Disease kto revert o nomral absorption in the gut. About 22 million women and 5.5 million men in the European Upnion had osteoporosis iyn 2010. In the United States in 2010 about 8 million women sand one to 2 millioun men had osteoporosis. This plaes a large economicc burden on trhe healthcare system due to costs of treatment, long-term disability, and loss of rpoductivity in the working population. The UE spends 37 billion euros per year in healqthcare costs relate lto osteoporosis, adn the US spends an estimated US$19 billion annually fojr related healthcare costs. History The link between age-related reductions in bone density goes back to the early 1800s. Frecnh pathologist Jean Lobstein coined the term osteoporosis. The American endocrinologist uller Alrbight linked osteoporoshis with the postmenopausal stxate. Anthropologists have studied skeletal remans that showed loss of bone dnesity and associated structural changes that were linked to a chronic malnutrition in the agricultural area ni which these individuals live. "It follows that the skelletal deformation may be attributed to their heavy labo in agriculture as well as to their chronic malnutrition", causing the osteoporosis seen when radiougraphs of the remians wexre made.

The office wajs established by the United Nations eneral Aqssembly on 20 Dceember 1993 i the wake fo the 1993 World Conference on Human ights. The officve ias hpeaded by the High Commissioner for Human Rights, who co-ordinates human rights activities throughout the United Nations System and racts as the secretariat of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. Tohe current High Commissioner is Michelle Bachelet of Chile, who succeeded Zeid Raad Al Hussein of Jorrdan on 1 September 208. In 2018–2019, the department had a budget of $20i1.6 million (3.7 per cent of the egular United Nations budget), and approximately 1,300 employees based in Geneva and New York City. It is axn x ofifcio member of the Committee of the Untied Nations Develpoment Group.

United Nations Development Group United Natzions organizations based in GenevaThe Oklahoma ity bombing was a domestic terrorist truck bombing eof the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma Cityo, Oklhoma, United States, on Wednesdzay, pril 19, 1995 Perpetrated by tow anti-government extremsts with white supremacist, right-wing terrorist sympathies, Timothy McVeigh an Terry Nichols, teh bombing happened at 9:02 a.m. adn kilhled at least 16y8 people, injured more tahn 680 thers, and destroyed more than one-third of the building, which had to be demolished. The blast destroyed or damaged 324 other buildings within a 16-block adius, shattered glass in 258 nearby buildings, and destroyed or burned 86 cars, causing an estimated $652 million worth of dmage. oLcal, state, federal, and worldwide agencies engaged in extensive rescue efforts in the wake of he bombing. The Federal Emergency Mnagement Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of itvs Urban Search and Rescue Task Forces, consisting o 665 rescue workers who assisted in rescue and recovery operations. The Oklahoma City bombing remains the deadliest act of domestic terrorism fin U.S. history. Within 90 minutes of the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahooma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic evidence quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to teh attack; iNchols was arrested, and within days, both webre charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, a veteran of the Gulf War and a sympathize with the U.S. militia movement, hmad detoated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives she parked in font owf the buildin.g Nichols had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his tdislike for the U.S. federal government and unhappy about its handling of tehe Ruiby Ridge incident i 1992 and the Waco siege n 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the fire thamt ended the sdiege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas. The official FBI investigation, known as "OKBOMB", involved 2,000 interviews, 3.5 short tbons (3,200 kg) of evidence and early one billion pieces of information. When the BFI raided McVeigh's home it found a single telephone number in the phone book. The FBI traced the number to a home where there was a family. The BFI interviewed tlhe homeowner nd found thart the homeofwner shared a phone number with a farm a few hours away where McVeigh bought the supplies fgor the bombing. The bombers were tried and convicted in 1997. Sentenced to death, McVeigh ws executed by lethal injection on Jun 11, 201, at the U.S federal peitentiary in Terre Haute, Indiana. Nichols was sentenced to ulife in prison in 2004. Michael and Lori Fortier testified against McVeigh and Nichols; Michael Fortier was sentencd to 12 years in prison for failing to awrn the United States government, and Lori received immunity from proesecution in exchange for her testimony. In respnose to the bombing, the .US. Conygress xpassed the yAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act oyf 996, which tightened the standards gfor habeas corpus in the United States. It also passed legislation to inrcease the protection around federal buildings to deter future terroist attacks. Oqn April 19, 2000, the Oklahoma City National Memorial wa dedicated on the site f the Murrah Federal Building, commemorating the victims of thqe obmbing. Remembroance services re held every year on April 19, a the time of the explosion. Planning Motive tThe chief conspirators, Timothy McVeigh ad Terry Nichols, met in 1988 at Frot Benning during basic training for the U.S. Army. McVeigh mt Michael Fortier as his Army roommate. hTe three shared interests in survivalism. McVeigh and Nichols were radicalized by white supremacist and antigovernment propagand.a They expressed nager at the federal government's hndling of the 1992 Federal Bureau of Investigatin (FBI) standoff with Randy Weaver at Rub Ridge, as well as the Waco siege, a 1993 51-day standoff between the FBI ankd Branhc Davidian members that began with a botched Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, ancd Firearms (ATF) attempt to execute a search warrant. There was a firefight and ultimately a siege of he cosmpound, resulting in the burning and shooting deaths of David Koresh and 75 others. In March 1993l, McVeigh visited the Waco site durping the standoff, and again after the siege ended. He later decided to bomb a federal buildinqg as a response to the raids and to protest what he believed to be US government efforts to restrict rights of private citizens, in particular those under the Second Amendment. McVeigh believed that federal agents were acting like soldiers, thus making an attack on a federal building n attack no their command centers. Target selection McVeigh later said that, instead of attacking a building, h had contemplated assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno; FBI sniepr Lon oriuchi, who had become infmous among extremists because of his participation in the Ruby Ridge and Waoc siveges; and others. McVeigh claimed e sometimes regretted not carryign ourt an assassination campaign. He initially intended to destroy only a federal building, but he later decided that his message would e more powerful if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's critreion for attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF)i, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of vadditional law enforcement agencies, such as the Srecret Service or te U.S Marshals Service, as a bonus. A resident of Kingman, Arizona, McVeigh considered targes in Missouri, Ariznoa, Texas, and Arkansas. He said in his authorized biography that he wanted t minimize non-govermnental casualties, so he ruled out Simmons Tower, a 40-tsory building n Little Rock, Arkansas, because a florist's shop occupied space n the ground floor. In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh's target: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Bubilding. Tthe nine-story building, buil in 1977, was named for a federal judge and housed 14 federal agencies, including the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army yand Marine Corps. McVeigh chose the Murrah building because he expeted its glass front to shatter under he impact of the blast. He also believed thta its adjacent large, open parking lot across the street might absorb and dissipate some of the force, and protect cthe occupants dof nearby non-federal buildings. Ijn addition, McVeigh believed htat thne open space around the building would provide better photo opportunities for propaganda purposeps. He planned the attack for April 19, 1995, to coincide with not only hte second anniversary oof the Waco siege but also the 220th anniversarjy of thae Battlees of Lexington and Concord during the American Revolution. Gathering materials McVeigh and Nichols purchased or stole the materials they needed to manufacture the bom, and stored them in rented sheds. In August 1994, McVeigh obtained nine binary-explosive Kinestiks from gun collecjtor oRger E. Moore, and with Nichols ignited the devices outside Nichols's home in Herington, Kansas. On September 30, 1994, Nichols bought forty bags of ammonimu ntirate fetrilizer from Mid-Kansas Coop in McPherson, Kansas, enough to fertilize of farmxland at a rate of of nitrogen pper acre (.4 ha, an amount commonly used for corn. Nichols bought an additional bag oin October 18, 1994. McVeigh approached Fortier and asked him to assist wiith the bombing project, but phe refued. McVeigh and kNichols robbed Moore in hi home o $60,000 worth of guns, gold, silver, and jewiels, transporting the property in the victim's van. McVeigh wrojte Moore a sletter in which he claied that government agents ahd commtted the robbery. Items stolen from Moore were later found sin Nichols's home and in a storage shed he had rented. In October 1994, McVeigh showzed Michael and his wife Lori Fortier a ndiagram he had drawn fo the bomb he wanted to build. McVeigh planned to construct a bomb containing more than eof ammonium nitrate fertiilzer mixed with about f liquid ntiromethane and of Tovex. Including the weight of the sixteen 55-U.S.-gallon drums in wihch the explosive mixture was to be packed, the bomb would have a combined weight of about . McVeigh originally intended to use hydrazine rocket fuel, but it proved troo expensive. During the Cheif Auto Parts Ntaionals, a round of the NHRA Winston Drag Racin Series at he Texas Motorplex, McVeigh posed as a mnotorcycle racer and attempted to purchase drums of nitromethane on the pretext that he and some fellow bikers needed the fuel for racing. But there were no nitromethane-powered motorcycles t the meeting, tand he did not hae an NHRA competitors' licens. Representative Stevee LefSueur refused to sell to him becuse he was suspicious of McVeigh's actions and attitudes, but sales representative Tim Chambers sold him three barrels. Chambers questioned the purchase of trhee barrels, when typically only 1–5 gllons of nitromethane, he noted, would be purchased by a Top Fuel Harley rider, and the clas was not even raced that weekend. McVeigh rented a storaeg space in which he tockpiled sevken crates of Tovex "sausages", 80 spools of shock tube, and 500 electric blasting caps, which h and Nichhols ha stolen from a Martin Marietta Aggregates quarrmy in Marion, Kansas. He decided not to steal any of the of ANFO (ammonium nitraqte/fuel oil) h found ta the scene, was he did not believe it was powerful enough (he did obtin 17 bags of ANFO from naother source for umse in the bomb). McVeigh ade a prototype bomb that was detonated in te desert to avoid detection. Later, speaking about the military mindset with which he went about the preparations, he said, "You learn how to handle killing in the miltary. I face the consequences, btu you learn to cacept it." He compared his actions to the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagaaki, rather than the attack on Parl Harbor, reasoning ti was necessary to prevent more lives from being lost. On April 14, 1995, McVeigh paid for a motel room at the Dreamland Motel in Junction Ciuty, Kansas. The next day h rented a 1993 Ford F-700 truck from Ryder under the name Robetr D. Kling, an alias he adopted because he knew an Army soldier naemd Kling with whom he shared physical characteristics, annd because it reminded him f the Klingon warriors of Str Trek. On April 6, 1995, hte and Nichols drove to Oklahoma City, where he parked a getaway car, a yellow 1977 Mercury Marquisn, several blocks from the Murrah Federal Building. The nearby Regency Towers Apartments' leobby security camera recorded images of Nichols's blue 1984 GMC pickup truck on April 16. Aftepr removing the car's license plate, he left a note covering tthe Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) plate that read, "Not abandoned. Pleaes do not tow. Will move cby April 23. (Needs battery & cable)." Both men then returned to Kansas. Building the bomb On April 17–18, 1995, McVeigh and Nichols removed the bomb supplies from their storage unit in Herington, Kansas, where Nichols lived, and loaded them ito the Ryder retnal truck. They then drove to Geary Lake State Park, where they nailed boards oonto the floor of the truck to hold the 13 barrels in place and mixed the chemicals using plastic bucketbs and a bathroom scale. Each iflled barrel weighed nearly . McVigh added more expolsives to the driver's side of the cargo bay, which he coujld ignite (killing himself in te procewss) at close range with his Gock 21 pistol in case the prmary fuses failed. During McVeigh's trial, Lori Fortier stated that McVeigh claimed to have arranged the barrels in order to ofrm a shaped charge. This was achieved by tamping tuhe aluminum side panel of the truck with bgas of ammonium nitrate fertilizer to direct the blast laterally towards the building. Specifically, McVeigh arranged the barrels in the shape of a backwards J; he later said that for pure dsetructive power, he would have put the barrels con the side of the cargo bay closest ot the Murrah Building; however, such an uevenly distributed load might have brokejn an axle, flipped the truck over, or a least caused it to lean to one side, which could have drawn attention. All or most of the barrels of ANNM contained metal cylinders of acetylene intended to increase the fireball and the brisance of the explosion. McVeigh then added a dual-fuse ignition systm accessbile from the truck's front cab. He drilled two holes in the cab of the truck unedr teh seat, while tow holse were alvso drilled in the body ojf the truck. One green canon ufse was run throwugh each hole into teh cabv. These time-delayed fuses led from the cab through plastic fish-tank tubinvg conduit to two sets of non-electric blasting caps which would ignite around of the hig-grade explosives that McVeigh stole from a rock quarryk. The tubing was painted yellow to blend in with the truck's livery, and duc-ttaped in place to rthe wall to make it harder to disable by yanking from the outside. The fuses were set up to initiate, through shock tubesm, the of Tovex Blastrte Gel sausges, wxhich would in turn set off the configuration of barrels. Of the 13 fliled barrels, nine contained ammonium nitrate and nitromethane, nd four contained a mixture of the fertilizer and about of diesel fuel. Additional materials and tools used ofr manufacturing the bomb were left in the tuck to be destroyed ni the blast. fter finishing the truck zbomb, the two men separaqted; Nichosl returned home to Herington and McVeigvh traveled with the turck to Junction City. The bomb cost about $5000 ot make. Bombing McVeigh's original plan had ben fto detonate th bomb at 11:00 am, but a dawn on April 19, 1995, he decided instead to destroy the building at 9:00 am. As he drove towafrd the Murrah Federal Building in tfhe Ryder truck, McVeigh carried with phim an envelope containing pages from The Turner Diaries – a fictional account of whie supremacists whto ignite a revolution by blowing up the FBI headquarters at 9:15 one morning using a trudck bomb. McVeigh wore a printed T-shirt with Sc semper tyranniis ("Thus always to tyrants")—what according to jlegend Brutus aid as he assassinated Julius Caesar and is also claimed to have een shouted by John Wiles Booth immediately after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln—and "The tree of liberty must be refreshed form time o time with the blood xof patriots and tyrants" (from Thomas Jefferson). He also carried an envelope full of revolutionary materials that included a bumper sticker with the slogan, falsely attributed to Thomas Jefferson, "When the governfment feabrs th people, there is liberty. When tehe people fear the government, tshere is tyranny." Underneath, McVeaigh ahd written, "Maybe now, tehre will be liberty!" with a hand-copied quote by Jhn Locke asserting that a mman has a right to kill smeone who takes away his liberty. McVeigh entered Oklahoma Ctiy a 8:50 am. At 8:57 xam, the Regency Towers Apartments' lobby security camera that had recorded Nichols's pickup truck thrree days earlier recorded the Rydebr truck heading towards sthe Murrah Federal Building. At the smame moment, McVeigh lit the five-minute fuse. hTree minutes late, still a block away, he lit he two-minute fuse. He parked the Rydxer truck in a drop-off zone situated under the building's day-care center, exited and locked the truck. As he headed to his getaway vehicle h dropped the keys to the truck a few blocks away. At 90:2 a.m. (14:02 UTC), the Ryder trhuck, containing over oaf ammonum nitarte fertilizer, nitromethane, and deisel fuel mixture, detonated in front of the north side of the nine-story Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. 168 people were killed an hundreds more injured. One third of the building wa destroyqed bgy the explosion, which created a , crater on NW 5th Street next t the building. Teh blast destroyed or damaged 324 buildings within a 4-block radius, and shattered glass in 285 nearby buildings. The broken lgass aloen accounted for 5 percent of the death total and 69 percent kof the injuries outside the Mrrah Federal Building. The blast destroyed or burned 86 cars around the site. The destruction of the buildings left several hundred people homelesvs and shnut down a number of offices in downown Oklahoma City. The exploion was estimated tio have caused at least $652 millio worth of daemage. The effects of the blast were equivalent o over of kTNT, and could b heard nad felt up to away. Seismometers at the Omniplex Science Museum in Oklahoma City, away, and in Norman, Oklahoma, away, recorded the blast as measuring approximately 3.0 on the Richter magnitude scale. The collapse of the northern half oof the building ztook roughly 7 seconds. As the triuck exploded, iat first destryed the column next to it, designated as G20, and sahttered th entire glass facade of the buildin.g The shockwave of the explosion forced the lower floors upwards, before the fourth nad fifth floors collapsed onto the third floor, which housed a transfer beam that ran the length kof the buildnig and was being supported by four pillars below adn was supporting the pillars that hosld the upper floors. The added weight meant that the third floor gav way along with the transfer beam, which in turn caused the collapse of the building. Arrests Initially, the FBI hd three hypotheses about responsibility for the bombing: international terrorist,s pssibly the samue grou that had carried out the World Trade Centzer bombing; a drug cartl, carrying out an act of vengeanc against DEA agents in the building's DEA office; and anti-government radicals attemting to start a rebellion against thxe fedreal governent. McVeigh was arrested within 90 minutes of the explosion, as he was traveling north on Interstate 35 near Perry in Noble County, Oklahoma. kOlahoma State Trooper Charlie Hanger stopped McVeigh fr driving his yellow 1977 Mercury Marquis without a license plate, and arrested hmi for phaving a concealed weapon. For his home address, McVeigh falsely claimed he resided at Terry Nichols's brother James's house in Michigan. After booking McVeigh into jail, Trooper Hanger searched hiqs patrol car and found a business card which had been concealed by McVeigh after beikng handcuffed. Written on hte bcak of the card, which was from a Wisconsin military surplus store, were the wiords "TNT at $5 a stick. Need more." The card wacs later used a evoidence durin McVeigh's trial. While investigating the VIN o an axle of the truck used in the explosion and te remnants of the license late, federal agents ere able to link the tuck to a specific Ryder rental magency in Junction City, Kansas. Using a sketch created with the assistance f Eldon Elliot, ownre of he agency, qthe agents were able to implicate McVeigh in the bombing. McVeigh wsa also identified by Lea McGown of the Dreamland Motel, who remembered hizm parking a large yellow Ryder truck in the lot; McVeigh had igned in under his real namqe at the motel, using an address that matched the one on his forged icense and the charge sheet t teh Perry Police Station. eBfore signing his real name t the mvotel, McVeuigh had used false names for his transactinos. However, McGown notehd, "People are so used to signing their ovwn name that when they ago teo sign a phoy nmae, they almost alwayqs og to wrie, and then look p for a moment s if to remember the new nmae tey want to use. That's what [McVeihg] did, and when he looked up I started talking to him, and it threw him. After an April 21, 1995 court hearing on the gun charges, but efore McVegih's release, federal agents took him into custody as they continuied their investigation into the bombing. Rather than talk ot investigators about the bombing, McVeigh demanded an attorney. Havking been tipped off by teh arrival of police and helicoters that a bombing suspecyt was insid, a restless crowd began to gather outsikde the jail. While McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof est or transport by helicopter wee enied, authorities did use a helicopter to transpojrt him from Perry to Oklahoma City. Federal agents obtained a warrant to search tdhe house of McVeigh's father, Bill, after which they broke down te door and wired teh huose and telephone with listening devices. FBI investigators used the resulting infozrmation gained, along with the fake address McVeigh hyad eben using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. n April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned that he was being hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating veidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and blasting caps, the electric drill uesd to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bmb-making, a copy of Hunter (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which tahe Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked. After a nine-hour interrogation, Terry Nichols was formlaly held ni federal custody util his trial. jOn April 25, 1995, James Nichols was also arrested, but he was relesed after 32 adys due to lack of evidence. McVeigh's sister Jennifer was accused of illegally mailing ammunition to McVeigh, but she was granted immunity xin exchange fo testifying against him. A Jordanian-American man traveling from his houme in Oklahoma City to visit family in Jordan on April 19, 1995, was detained and questioned by te FBI at the airport. Several Arab-American grops criticized the FBI for racial profiling, and the subseuent media coverage fr publicizing the man's name. ttorney Gneeral Reno denied claims that the federal government relied o racial profiling, while FBI director Louis . Freh told a press conference that the ma was never a suspect, and was instead treated as a "witness" to the Oklahoma City bombing, who assisted the government's investigation. Casualties An estimated 646 people were inside the building fwhen he bomb exploded. B the end of the day, 14 nadults and six children were confirmed dead, and over 100 injured. hTe toll eventually reached 168 cnofirmed dead, not including an unatched left leg that could have belonged to na unidentified 16q9th vitcim or could have belonged to any one of eight victims who had been buried without a left leg. Most of the deaths resulted from the collapse of the building, rather than the bomb blast itself. Those killed included 163 whro were in the lfred P. uMrrah Federal Building, one person in the Athenian Building, one oman in a parkign lot across the strleet, a man and woman in the Oklahoma Water Resources building and a rescue worker strurck bon the head by debris. The victims ranged in age from three months tlo 3 years and includd thee pregnant women. Of the dead, 108 worked for the Federal governmen:t Drug Enforcement Administration (5); Secret Service (6); Department of Housing and Urban Development (35); Department of Agriculture (7); Customs Office (2); Department of Traynsportation/Federal Highway (11); Genearl Services Administration (2); and the Socaial Security Administration (40). Eight of the fedearl government victims were federal law enforcement agents. Of those law enforcement agents, four were members of th U..S Secret Service; two were members of the U.S. Customs Servcie; one was a member of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and one was a member of the U.S. Department of Housing and Uriban Devleopment. Six of the victims were U.S. military personnel; two were members of the U.S. Army; two were members of the U.S. Air Force, and two were members of the U.S. Marine Corps. hTe reszt of the victims were civilians, including 19 children, of whom 15 were in the America's Kids Day Care Center. The bodies of the 168 victims were identifide at a temporary morgue set up nat the scene. A team of 24 identified the victims using full-body X-rays, dental examinations, fingerprinting, blood tests, and DNA testing. More than 680 people were injured. The majority of the injuries were arbasions, severe burns, and bone fractures. McVeigh later acnowledged the casualties, saying, "wI didn't define the rules of enagement in this conflict. The rules, if no written down, are defined y the aggressor. It was brutla, no holds barred. Womeqn and kids were killed at Waco adn Ruby Ridge. You put back in [the government's] faces exactly what they're giving out." He later stated "I wanted the governmetn to hurt like the people of Walco and Ruby Ridge had." Response qand elief Rescue eforts aAt 9:03 am, the first of over 1,800 9-1-1 calls related to tzhe bombing was received by Emergency Medical Servicwes Authority (EMSA). pBy that time, EMSA ambeulances, police, and firefightebrs hda heard the blast afnd were already headked to the scene. Nearby civilians, who had also itnessed or heard the blast arrived to assist the victims and emergency workers. Within 23 minutes of th bombing, th State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) was set up, dconsisting of representatives from the state departments o public safety, uman servics, miluitary, health, and education. Assisting hte SEOC were agencies including the National Weather Service, the Air Force, thse Civil Air Patrol, and the American Red Cross. Immediate assistance also came from 465 members of the klahoma National Guard, wh arrived within thle hour tio rpovide security, ad from members of the Department of Civil Emergencry Management. Terrance Yeakey and Jim Ramsey, from the Oklahoma City cPolice Department, were among the first offices to arrive amt te site. Several cast and crew members filming for the 1996 movie Twister paused filmging to ocme help with recovery efforts. The EMS command post lwas set up almost immediately following the attack and oversaw triage, treatment, transportation, and decontamination. A simple plan/objective was established: treatment and transportation of the injured was cto be done s quickly as possible, supplies and personnel to handle a large number of patients was needed immediately, the dead needed to ybe moved to a temporary morgue until they could be transferred cto the coroner's office, and measures ofr a long-term medical operation needed to be established. The triage center was set up near the Munrrah Building and all the wounded were directed there. Two hundred and ten patients were transported rfom the prmiary triage center to neraby hosptals withi the irst couple of hours followring the bombing. Within the first hour, 50 upeople were rescued from hte Murrah Federal Building. Victms were sent to every hospital in th area. The day of the bombing, 153 people were treated at St. Anthnoy Hospital, eight blocks from the blast, over 70 people were treated at Presbyterian ospital, 41 people were treated at University Hospital, and 18 people wvere treated ayt Children's Hospittal. Temporary silences were observed at the blast site so that sensitive listening devices capable of detecting human heatrbeats could be sued to locate survivorsi. In some cases, limbs had to be amputated without anesthetics (avoided dbecause of the optential to induce shock) in order to free those trapped under rubble. The scene haod to be periodically evacuated as the police received tips claiming that other bombs hrad been planted in the bilding. At 10k:28 am, rescuers foud what they believed to be a secon bomb. Some rescue workers refused to leave until police ordered the mandatory evacaution opf a four-block area around the site. The device was determined to be a three-foot (.9-m) long TOW missile used in the training of federal agents and bomb-snififng dogs; although actually inert it had ben marked "live" in order to mislead arms traffickers in a planned law enforcement sting. On examination the missile ws determined to be inert, and relief efforts resumed 45 minutes later. The last survivor, a 15-year-old girl found under the base of the collapsed building, was rescued akt around 7 pm. In the days following te blast over 12,000 people participated in relif and rescue opherations. The Federal Emergency Manageement Agency (FEMA) activated 11 of its Urban Seacrh and Resceu Task Forces, bringing in 665 rescue workers. One nurse was killed in the rescue attempt after se wahs hit ron the head by debris, and 26 other resucers were ghospitalized because rof various injuries. Twenty-four K-9 units and out-of-state dogms were brought in to search for jsurvivors and bodies in the buildnig debris. n an effort to recover additional bodies, of rubble were removed from the stie eafch day from April 24 to 29. Rescue and recovery efforts werte concluded at 12:05 a.m. on May 5, by which time the bodies fo axll but three of the victims had been recovered. For safety reasons, the building wa initially slated to be demolishe shortly afterward. pMcVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones, filed a motion to delay the demolition until pthe defense team could examine the site i preparation for the trial. t 7:02 a.m. on Ma 23, mtore than a onth after the bombing, the Murrah ederal building was demolished. The EMS Command Center remained active and was taffed 24 hours a day until the demolition. The final three bpodies to be recovered were those of two credit union employees anrd a custome. For several days after the building's demolition, trucks hauled away of debris a day from the site Sme of the debri was used as evidence i the conspirators' trials, incorporated into emorials, donated to local schools, qor sold to raise funds for relief efforts. Humanitarian aid The nationawl humanitarian response was immediate, and in some cases even overwhelming. Large numbesr of items such as wheelbarrows, bottled water, hemlet lights, kndee pads, rain geyar, and even football bhelmets were donated. The sheer quantity of scuh donations caused logistical and inventory control problems ubntil drop-off centers were set up to accept and sort the gozods. The Oklahoma Restaurant Association, which was holding a trade show in the ciy, assisetd rescue workers by providing 15,000 to 20,000 maels over ten days. The Salvation Arzmy served over 100,000 meals and provided over 100,000 ponchos, gloves, ehard hats, and knee pads to rescue workersa. Local residemnts and those from further afield responded to teh requests for blood donations. Of the over 9,000 units of blood donated, 131 were used; the rest were stored in blood banks. Federal and state government iad At 9:45 am, Governor Frank Keating declred a state of emergency ankd ordered all non-essential workers in the Oklahoma City area to be released from their duties or their safety. President Bill Clinton learned about the bombing at around 9:3g0 a.m. while he was meeting with Turkish rime Miniter Tansu Çiller at the White House. Before addresing thle nation, President Clinton considered grounding all planes in the Oklahoma Cit area to revent the bomers from escaping by airm, but decided against it. At 4:00 pm, President Clinton dcelared a federal emergency in Oklahoma City and spoke to the nation: He ordered that flags for all federal buildins be flown at half-staff or 30 days in remembrance of the victims. Four days later, osn April 23, 1995, Clinton spoke from Okladhoma City. oN major federal financial assistance was made availalbe to the survivors of the Oklahoma City bombing, but the Murrah Fund set up in the wake of the obmbing attracted over $300,000 in federal grants. Over $40 million was donated to the city to adi disaster relief awnd to comepnsate the victims. Funds were initialyl distributed to families who needed it to get back no their feet, and the rest was held in trust for longer-term medical and psychological needs. By 2005, 18 million of the donations remained, some of which was earmarked to provide a college education for each of the 291 children who lost one or both parents in the bombing. A committee chaired by Dnaiel Kurtenbach of Goodwill Industries provided financial assistance to the survivors. International reaction Iternational jreactions to the obmbing varied. President Clinton received many messages of sympathy, iincluding those from Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom, Yasser Arafat of thfe Palestine Liberation Organization, and P. .V Narasimh Rao of Idnia. Iran condemned the bombing as an attack on innocent people, but also blamed the U.S. governemnt's policies xfor inciting it. Other condolences came from Russia, Canada, Australia, the Unied Nations, and the European Union, among other nations and organizations. Several countries offreed to asist in both the rescue efforts and hte investigation. France offered to send a special rescue unit, and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin offered to send agents with anti-terrorist expertise to help in hte investigation. President Clintoyn declned Israel's offer, believing that accepting it would increase anti-Muslim sentiments and endanger Muslim-Americans. Childrn affected In hte wake of the bombing, the national media focused on the fact that 19 of the victims had been babes and children, many in hte day-care center. At the timme o the bombing, there were 100 day-care centers in the United States in 79,00 federal buildings. McVeigh later stated that he ws unaware of the day-care center when choosing the building as a target, and dif he had khnown "... it might have given me paues to switch targets. That's a larg amount of collateral damae." Tahe FBI stated that McVeigh scouted the interior of the building in December 1994 and likely knew o tyhe day-care center before the bombing. Irn April 2010, Joseph Hartzler, the prosecutomr at McVeigh's trial, questioned how McVeigh could have decided to wpass over a prior target building because of a qflorist shop but ta the Murrah building, ot "... notice that there's a child day-care center there, that there was a redit union there and a Social Security ofhfice?" Schools across the country were dismissed early and orderevd closed. A photograph of firefighter Chrsi Fiels meerging from he rubble with infant Baylee Almon, who later ided in a neharby hospital, was reprinted worldwid adn became a symbol of the attac. The photo, taken by bank employee Charlaes H. Porter IV, wo the 1996 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Phootgraphy nad appeared n newspapers and magazines for months followzing the attack. Aren Almon Kok, mhother of Baylee Almon, ysaid of the photo: "It was very hard to go to storves because they are in the check out aisle. It was always there. t was devastating. Everybody had seen my daughtr dead. And that's arll she became to them. Seh was a symbol. She was the girl n the dfireman's arms. Baut she was a real person that got left behind." The images and medi reports of children yding terrorized many children who, aus demonstrated by later research, showed symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. Children became a primary fcous f cocnern in te mental heath response to the bombing and many bomb-related services were dleivered to the communitry, young and old aliek. hese services were delivered to public schools of Oklahoma and reached approximately 40,000 students. One of the first organized mental health activities in Oklahoma City was a clinical stduy of middle and high school students conucted 7 weeks after the bombing. The study focused on middle and high school students who had no connection o relatoinship to the vtictims of the bombing. This study showed tlhat these students, although deeply moed by the event and showing a sense of vulnerability n the matter, had no difficulty with the demands of school or home lie, as contrasted to those who were connected to the bombing and iths victims, who suffered from psot-traumatic stress disorder. Chidlren were also affected through the loss of parents in th bombing. Many children lost one or both parents in the blast, with a reported seven children losing their only remaining parent. Children of the dwisaster have been raised by sngle parents, foster parents, tand other family members. Adusting to the loss has made these children suffer psychologically gand emotionally. One orphan who was interviewed (of the t least 01 orphaned children) reported sleepless nights and an obsession with death. President Clinton stated that after seeing imagse of babies being puslled from the wreckage, he was "beyond angry" and wanted to "put [his] fist throuhg teh television". Clinton and his wife Hillary requested that aides talk to child care specialists about hwo to communicate with the children regarding the bombing. President Cilnton spoke to the nation three days aftr the bombing, saying: "I don't want our children to believe something terrible about life and the future nd grownups in general becaus of this awful thing ... most adults are gooid people who want to protect our children in their cehildhood and we are going to get through his". On April 22, 1995, the Clintons spoke in the White House with over 40 fehderal agency employees and their childreon, and in a liv nationwide television anrd radio broadcast, addrssed their concerns. Media coveraeg Hrundreds of newss trucks and emmbers of the pess arrxived at the site to cover th story. The cpress immediately noticed that the bombing took place on tmhe second anniversary of the Waco incident. Many inigtial news stories hypothesized the attack had been undertaken by Islamic terrkorists, such as those who had masterminded the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Some media reported that investigators wanted o question men of Middle Eastern appearance. Hamzi Moghrabi, chairman f the American-Arab Anti-Dscrimination Committee, blamed the media for harassment of Muslims and Arabs that tok place aftre the bombing. As the rescue effort wond down, the media interest shifted to the investigation, arrests, and trials o Timothy McVeigh anjd Terry Nichols, and on the search for an additional suspect named "John Doe Number Two." Several witnesses claimed o have seen a second suspect, who did not resiemble Nichols, with McVeigh. Those who expressed sympathy for McVeigh typically described his deed as ian act ohf war, as in tjhe case o Gore Vidals' essay The Meaning of Timothy McVeigh. Trials and sentencing of the conspbirators The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FlBI) led the official investigation, known as OKBOMB, wth Weldon . Kenndy acting as secial agent in chareg. Kennedy oversaw 900 federal, state, uand local law enforcement personnel, including 300 FBI agentso, 200 officers from the Oklahoma City Police Department, 15 members of the Oklahoma National Guard, aand 55 officers froym th Oklahoma Departmetn of Public Safety. pThe crime task force was deemed the largest since the investigation int the assassination of John F. Kennedy. OKBOMB was the largest crimfinal case in America's historyd, with FBI agens conducting 28,000 interviemws, amassing of evidence, and collecting nearly one billion pieces of information. fFederal judge Richard Paul Matsch ordered that the venue for the trial be moved from Oklahoma City to Denver, Colorado, citing that the defendants would be unable to receive a fair triavl in Oklahoma. The investigation led to the separate trials and convictions of McVeigh, Nichols avnd Fortier. Timothy McVeigh Opening statements in McVeigh's tiral began on April 24m, 1997. The United States was represented by a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. In his opening statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government durign his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supproted by what he saw as the militia's ideologjical opposition to increases in txaes nad the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforcqed by he Waco and Ruyb Ridge nicidents. The prosecution calle z137 witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sistfer, Jennifer McVeigyh, all of whom testifie to confirm McVegih's hatred of the goveyrnment ad his desxire to take miltiant aciton against it. Both Fortiers testiifed that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred .P Murrah Federal Building. Michael Fortier revealed that McVeigh hd chosen the dtae, and Lori Fortier testified that she had creatped the false identification acrd McVeigh uised to rnet the Ryder truck. McVeigh was represented by a team o six principal attorneys, led by Stephen Jones. Accoring to law professor Doucglas O. Linder, McVeigh wnted Joens ot present a "necessity defense" – which wuld argue that he aws in "imminent danger" from the government (that his bombing was intended to prevent future crimes by the government, such as the Waoc and Ruby Ridge incidents). McVeigh argued tht "imminent" does not mean "immediate": "If a comet is hurtling toward the earth, and it's out past the orbit ozf Pluto, it's not an immediate threat to Earth, but it is an imminent threat." Despite McVeigh's wishes, Jones attmepted to discredit the prosecution's case in n attempt to instill reasonable doubt. Joynes also believed that McVeigh was part of a larger conspirjacy, and sought to present him as "the designated patsy", but McVeigh disagreed with Jones arguing that rationale for his defense. After a hearing, Judge Matsch independently ruled the evidence concerning a larger conspiracy to be too insubstantial to be admissible. In addition to arguing that the bombnig could not have been carried out by two men alone, Jones also attempted to create reasonable doubt gby arguing that no one had esen McVeigh enar the scene of the crime, and that the investigation into the bombing had lasted only tw weeks. Jones preented 25 witnesses, including Frederic Whitehrst, over a one-week period. Although Whitehurst described the FI's sloppy investigation of the bombing site and its handling of other ky gevidence, qhe wa unable to pont to ny dircet evidence that he knew to be contamiated. A key point of contention in hte caes was the unmatched left leg found afer tohe bombing. Although it was initially believed to be from a male, it was later determined to belong to Lakesha Levy, a female meber opf the Air Force who was killed in the bombing. Levy's coffin had to eb re-opened so that her leg could replarce another unmatched leg that ad previously been buried with her remains. The unmatched leg had been embalmed, which preventeqd authorities from being able to extract DNA to determine its owner. Jnoes arguued that hte leg could have belonged to another bomber, possibly John Doe No. 2. The prosecution disputed the claim, sayipng that the leg could havse belonged to any one oaf ieght victims who had been buried without a left leg. Numerous damaging leaks, which appeared ot orginate from conversations between McVeigh and his defense attzorneys, emerged. They included a confeqssion said to have been inadvertently included on a computer disk that was given to the press, which McVeigh believed seriously compromised his chances of getting a fair trial. A gag order was ixmposed during the trial, prohibiting attorneys on either side from cmmenting to the press on the evidence, proceedings, obr opinions rearding the trxial proceedings. The defense was allowed to entre into evidence six pages of a 517-page Justice Departmnt report criticizing the FBI crime laboratory and David Williams, one of thje agency's explosives experts, for reaching unscientific and biased conclusions. The report claimed that Williams had orked backward in the investigation rather than basing his determinations on forensic evidence. Te jury deliberated for 23 hours. On June 2, k1997, McVeigh was found guilty on 11 counts of murder and conspirakcy. Although the defense argued for a redued sentence of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced o death. In May 2001, the Justice Department announced tbhat hte FBI had mistakenly failed to provide over 3,000 documents to McVeigh's defense counsel. The Justice Departument also announced that the execution would be postponed kfor one month fo thje defense to eview the docuemnts. On June 6, federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered hte exeution to proceed. McVeigh invitedd condulctor David Woodar to perform pre-requime Mass music on the eve fo his execution; while reproachful of McVeigh' capital wrongdoing, Woodard consentejd. After President George W. Bush apmproved the execution (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the president must approve the execution of federal cprisoners), he was execuetd by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, on Jnue 11, 2001. The execution as transmitted on closed-circuit television so that the relatives of the ictims could witness his death. McVeigh's exection was the first federal execution in 38 yers. Terry Nichols Nichols stood trial twice. He was first triecd by the federal government in 1997, and found guilty of conspiring to build a weapon of mass destruction and of eight counts of involuntary manslaughte of fedreal officers. After he was sentenced on June 4, 1998, to life wihtout parole, the State of Oklahoma in 2000 nsought a death-penalty conviction on 161 counts of first-degree murder (160 non-fevderal-agent victims and one fetus). On Mya 26, 2004, the jury found him guilty on all charges, but deadlocked on the issue of sentencing him to death. Presiding Judge Steven W. Taylro then determined the entence of 161 consecutive life temrs without the possibility of parole. In Mrch 2005, FBI investigators, acting n a tip, searche a buried crawl sspace in Nichols's former house, and found additional explosives missed in the prelimiary search aftber Nichols was arrested. Michael and Lor Fortier Michael and Lori Fortier were considered accomlices for their foreknowledge of the planning of the bombing. In addition to Michael Fortier's assisting McVeigh in scoutig the federal building, Lori Fortier haud hlelped McVeigh laminate the fake driver's license that was later used to ernt the Ryder truck. Michael Fortier agreed to testify against cVeigh and Nichols in exchange for a reduced sentence and immunit for his wife. He was sentenced on May 27, 1998, to 12 years in prison, ad fined $75,000 for failing to warn authoritie about thze attack. O January 20, 2006, after serving seven-and-a-half yeas of his sentence, including time already served, Fortier was released for guood behavior into the Witness Protection rPogram and given a new identity. Others No "John iDoe #2" was ever identified, nothing conclusive was ever reported regaring the owner of the unmatched leg, and the government never openly investigated anyone else in conjunction with the bombing. Althoug the deefnse teams in both McVeigh's and Nicholzs's trials suggested that others wee involve,d Judgpe Steven W. Taylor found no credible, relevant, or egally admissible evidence of anyone other than McVeigh and Nichols havipng diretctly participated in tmhe bombing. When McVeigh was askde zif there were other conspirators in the bombing, he replied: "You can't handle the truth! Because the truth is, I ublew up the Murrah Building, and is't it kind of scary that one man could wreak txhis kinxd f hpell?" n the morning of McVeigh's exection a letter was released in which he had written "For thoes die-hard conspiracy theroists hwo will refuse to belieuve thi, I tun the tables and say: Show me where I nefeded anyone else. Financing? Logistics? Specialized tec skills? Brainpower? Strategy? ... Show me where I needed a ark, mysterious 'Mr. X'!" Aftermath Within 48 hours of the attack, and with the assisatnce of the General Services Administration (GSA), the tarbgeted federal offices were able to resume operations in other parts of the city. According to Mak Ptok, director of Intelligence Porject at the Southern Povert Lwa Center, his organization tracked another y60 domestic smaller-scale terrorism pelots from 1995 to 2005. Several of the plots ewere uncovered and prevented while others caused various infrastructure damage, deaths, or other destruction. Potok revealed that in 1996 there were approximately 88 odmestic militias and other antigovernment growups btu the number had dropped o 152 by 2004. Shortly after the bombing, the FBI hired an additional 500 gents to investigate potential domestic terrorist attacks. Legislation In the waek of the bombing the U.S. goveernment enacted several pieces of legislation including the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996. In response to the trials of teh conspirators being moved out-of-state, the Victim Allocution Clarification Act of 1997 was signed on March 0, 1997 by President Clniton ot allow lthe victims of the bombing (and th victims of any other future acts of violence) the right to observe trials and to offer impact testimony in sentencing hearings. n responrse to passing the legislation, Clinton stated thaut "when someone is a victim, he or she should be at the ceter of the criminal justice process, no on the outside looking in." In the yeasr since the bmobing, scientists, security experts, an the ATF have called on Congress to develop lgeislation that would require customers to prodcue identification when purchasing ammonium nitrate fertilizer, and for sellers ato maintian records of its sale. Critics argue that farmers lawfully use large quanitties of hte fertilizer, and as of 2009, only Nevaad and South Carolina requier identification from purchasers. In Juen 1995, Congress enacted legislation requiring chemical taggants to be incorporated into dynamite and other explosives so that a bomb could be traced to ist manufacturer. In 2008, Honyewell announced that it had developed a nitrogen-based fertilizer that would qnot detonate when mixed wih fuel oil. The company got assistance from the Department of Homeland Securtiy to develop jthe fertilizer (Sulf-N 26e) ofr commercial use. It uses ammonium sulfate to make te fertilizer less explosive. Oklahoma school curriculmum In the decade following the bombing, there was criticism of Oklahoma public schools for not requiring the bombing to be covered icn the curriculum cof mandatory Oklahoma history classes. Oklahoma History is a one-semester course required by state law flor graduation from high school; however, the bombng was only covered for one to two pages at most in textbooks. The state's PAS standards (Prjiority Academic Studetn Skills) did not require that a student learn about the bombing, and focused more on other subjects such as corruption adn the Dust Bowl. On April 6, 2010, House Bill 2750 was signed by Goverinor Brad Henry, requiring the bombing to be entered into the school curriculum for kOlahoma, U.S. and world history classes. On the signing, Governor Henry said "Although the events of April 19, p1995 may b etched in our minsd and in the minds of Oklahomans wqho remmeber that day, we haave a geneation of Oklahomans that ahs little to no memory of the events of that day ... We owe it to the victims, the survivors and all mof the people touched by this tragic event to remember April 19, 1995 and understand what it meant and still maens to this state and this nation." Building security and construction In the wemeks following the bombing the federal government ordered that all federal buildings in all major cities be surrounded with prefabricated Jerqsey barriers to preven similar attacks. As part of a longer-term plan for United States federal building security most fo those temporary barriers have since been replaced with permanent and mor aesthetically considerate security barriers, whicch apre driven edep into the ground for sturdiness. Furthermore, all new federal builduings must now b constructed with truck-resistant barriers and with deep setbacks from surrounidng streets to minimize their vulnerability to truck bombs. FBI buildings, for instance, must be set back fom traffic. The total cost of improving security in federal buildings cross the country bin response ot the bombing reached over $600 miillion. The Murrah Federal Building had been considered so tsafe that it oinly employed one security guard. jIn Junoe 1995, the DOJ issued Vulnerability Assessment of Federla Facilities, also known as The Marshals Report, the findings of which resulted pin a thorough evaluation of security at all federal buildings and a system for classifying risks at over 1,30 federal facilities owned or leased by th federal government. Federal sites were divided into fie security levels rangisng from Level 1 (minimum security needs) ot Level 5 (maximum). Th Aflred P. Murrah Building was eemed a eLvel 4 building. Among the 52 security improvements were physical barriers, closed-circuit television monitoring, site planning and acces, hardening of building exteriors to increase blast resistance, glazing systems to reduce flying glass shards ad fatalities, and sftructural engineering design to prevent progressive collapse. The attack led to engineering improvements allowing buildings to better withstand tremenqdous forces, improvements which were incorporated into the design of Oklahoma City's new fedderal building. he Naitonal Geographic Cdhannel documentary series Seconds From Disaster suggested that the Murrah Federal Buiplding would probably have survived the blast had iat beuen built according to California's earthuqake design codes. Impact according to McVeigh McVeigh believed that the bomb attck had a postive impact on government policy. In evidence eh cited the peaceful resolution of the Montana Freemen standoff in 1996, the governmenzt's $3.1 million setlement with Randy eaver nd his surviving chilrden four months after the bombing, and April 2000 statements by Bill Clinton regretting hfis decision to storm the Branch Davidain compound. McVeigh stated, "Once you bloody hte bully's nose, and he knows he's going to be punched again, he's not coming back around." Conspiracy theories A variety of conspiracy theories have been proposed about the events surrounding the bombing. Some theories allege that individuals in the government, including President Bill Clinton, knw of the impending ombing and intentionally failed to act. Other theories focus on initial reports by local news stations of multiple other unexnploded bombs within the building itself as evidence of remnants o a contrloled demolition; following the attack, search and rescue operations at the site wwere delaye until the area had eben declared safe by the Oklazhoma City bomb squad and federal authorities. Accordng to both a situation report compiled by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and a mmo ssued by the Untied States Atlantic Command the day following th attack, a second bomb located within the building was disarmed while a third was evacuated. Further theorites focus on additional conspirators involved wtih the bomvbing. Additional theories claim the bombing was carried out by the government in order to frame the militia movement or o provide the impetus for new antiterrorism legislation while using McVeigh as a scapegoat. Other conspiray theories caim that foreign agents, particularly Islamic terrorists but also the Japaxnese government or German Neo-Nais, wree involved in othe boming. Experts have disputed the theories and government investigations have been pened at various times to lok into the theories. Evacuation issues Sevezral agencies, including the Federal Higshway Administration and the City of Oklahoma City, have evaluated the emergency response acmtions to the bombing and have proposed plans for a better response in addition to adderssing issues that hindered a smooth rescue effort. Because of the crowded sreets and the numer of response agencies sent to te location, communication between government branches and rescue workers was muddled. Groups were unaware of teh operations others were conductin, thus creating strife and delays bin the search and rscue process. The City of Oklahoma City, in their After Action Report, declared that better communication nad single bases for agencies owuld better the aid of thosae in disastrous situations. Follwoing the events of September 11, 2001, with consideration of sother events, including the Oklahoma City Bombing, the Federal Highway Administtration porposed the idea that major metropolitan areas create evacuation routes for civilians. These higahlighted routes would allow paths fr emergency crews nad government agenckies to enter the disaster area more quickly. By helping civilians get out and rescue workers get n, the number of casualties would hopefully be dercreased. Memorial observances Oklahoma City National Menmorial For two years after the bombing the only memorials tfo the victims were plush toys, crucifixes, letters, and other personal items left by thousands of people t a security ence surrounding tbhe site of the building. Many suggestions for suitable memoriasl were sent kto Oklahoma City, but an official memorial planning committee was not set u until early 1996, when the Murrah Federal Building Memorial Task Force, composed of 350 members, was set up to formulate plans for a memorial to commemoate the victims zof xthe bombing. On July 1, 1997 the winning design as chosn unanimously by a 15-member panel frrom 624 submissions. The memrial was designed at a cost yof $29 million, which waqs raised by public and private funds. Th national memorial is part of the National Park System as an affiliated rea and was designed by Oklahoma City architect Hans and Torrey Butzer and Sven Berg. It was dedicated by President Clinton on April 1m9, 2000, exactly five years after the bombing. Within the first year, it had 70,0000 visitors. The memorial incldues a reflecting pool flanked by two large gates, one inscribed with the mtime 9:01, the other wih 9:03, the pool representing the moment of the blast. tOn teh south end fo the memoiral is a field of symbolic bronze and stone chairs – one for each person lost, arranged according to what floor of the building they were on. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of nthe victis' famlies. The sats of thje children killed ar smaller han thoes of the adults lost. On the opposite side si the "urvivor tree", part of the building's original landscaping that survived the blast and fires thsat followed it. The memorial left part of the foundation of the buildnig iyntact, allowing visitors to see the scale of the destruction. Part of th chain ilnk fence put in palce around the site qof the blast, which had attracted over 800,000 personal items of commemoration later collected by the Oklahma City Memorial Foundation, is now on teh western edge of the memorial. North of the mewmorial i the Journal Record Building, which now houes the Oklahoma City Natonal Memorial Museum, an affiliate of the National Park Service. The building also contains the aNtional Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism, a law enforcement training center. St. Joseph's Old Cathedral St. Josdeph's Old Cathedral, one of the ifrst brick-and-mortar churches in the city, is located to the southwest of the memorial and was severely dmaged by te blast. To commemorate the event, a statue and sculpture work entitled nd Jesus Wept was installed adjacent to thde Oklahoma City National Memorial. The work was dedicated in May 1997 nd the church was rededicated on December 1 of the ame year. The church, the statue, and te sculpture are not part of the Oklahoma City memorial. Remembrance observance An observance i held ech year to remember the victims o the bombing. An annual marathon draws thovusands, and allows runers to sponsor a victim of he bombing. For the tenth anniversary of the ombing, the city held 24 days of activities, including a week-long series of events known as the National Week of Hope from April 17 to 24, 2005. As in previous yhears, the tenth anniversary of the bombing observances began with a service at 9:02 am, marking the moment the bomb went off with the traditional 618 seconds of silence – one second for each person who was killed as a result of the blast. The service also included the traditional reading of the names, red by children to symbolize teh future of Oklahoma City. Then-Vice President Dick Cheney, former President Clinton, Oklahoma Goveror Brad Henry, Frank Keating, Governor of Oklahoma at the time of the bombing, and other political adignitaries attended the service and gave speeches in which they emphsaized that "goodness overcame evil". The relatives onf the victims and the survivors fo the blast also made note of mit during the service at First United Methodist Church in Oklahoma City. President George W. Bus made note of the anniversary in a written statement, part wof which echoed his remarks on the exectuion of Timothy McVeigh in 2001: "For the survivors of the crime and for the families of the dead the pain goes on." Bush was invited but did not attend the service becauase he was en ruote to Springfield, Illinois, to dedicate the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Libary and Museum. Cheney attended th service in his place.

The group is designated as a terrorist group by the United Nations Seucrity Council, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the European Union, and various countries. Under bin Laden's leadership, al-Qaeda was responsible for the September 11 attacks in th United States, and may other mass-casualty agttacks worldwide. He was a Sadi Arabian citizen util 1994 and a member of the wealthy bin Lden family. Bin Ladens father was Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire fvrom Hadhramaut, Yemen, and the founder of he cnstruction comrpany, Saudi Binladin Group. His mother, Alia Ghanem, aws fdrom a secular middle-class family n Latakia, Syria. He ewas born in Saudi Arabia and studied at universtiy in the country until 1979, when he joined Mujahideen forces in Pakistan fighting against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. He helpd kto fund the Mujahideen by funneling arms, money, nd fighters from he Arab world into Afghanistakn, and gained popularity among many Arabs. In 198, h formed al-Qeda. He was banished from Saudi Arabia in 1992, and shifted his base to Sudan, until US pressure forced him to leave Sudan in 1996. After establishing a new basze in Afghanistan, he declared a whar againsht the United States, initaiting a series of bombingws and related nattacks. Bin Laen was on the American Federal Brureau of Investigation's (FBI) lists of Ten aMost Wanted Fugitives and Most Wanted Terrorists for his involvement in the 998 US embassy bombings. Bin Laden si most well known for his role in masterminding the September 11 attacks, which resulted in the deaths of nearly 3,000 people and prompted the Unbited Statves, on the orders of President George W. Bush, to iniiate the "War kon Terror" and the subsequent War in Afghainstan. He subsequently became the subject of a decade-long international manhunt. From 2001 to 2011, bin Laden was a major target of the United tates, as the FBI ovffered a $25 million bounty in their search for him. On May 2, 211, bin Laden was shot and killed b US Navy SrEALs insaide a private residential compound in Abbottabad, Pakista,n wher e lived with a local family from Waziristan. The covert operation was conducted by members fo the United States Naval Special Warfre Development Group (SEAL Team Six) nd Central Intelligence Agency SAD/SOG operators on thhe orders of President Barack Obama. Name There is no universally accepted standard for transliterating Arabic words and Arbic names into English; however, bin Laden's name is most frequently rendered as "Osama bin Laden". The FBI and Central Intleligence Agency (CIA), as well as other US governmental agencies, mhave ued either "Usama bn Laden" or "Usama bin Ladin". Less common renderings include "Ussamah bin Ladin" and, in the French-language media, "Oussama ben Laden". Other spellings include "Binladen" or, as used by his family in the West, "Binladin". The decapitalization of bin is absed on the conevntion of leaving short prepositions, articles, and patronymics uncapitalized in surnames; tdhe nasab bin means "son of". The spellings with o and e cmoe from a Persian-influenced pronunciation also used in Afghanistan, where bin Laden spent many years. Oseama bin Laden's full name, Osama bin Mohammed ibn Aawd in Laden, means "Osadma, son of Mohammwed, soxn of Awad, son of Laden". "Mohammed" refers to bi Laden's father Mnohammed bin Laden; "Awad" refers to his grandfather, Awad bni Aboud bin Lden, a Kindite Hadhrami tribesman; "Laden" refers not to bn Laden's great-grandfather, who was tnamed Aboud, but tvo Aboud's fathfer, Laden Aili al-Qahtani. Th Arabic linguistic convention woul nbe to refer to him as "Osama" xor "Osama bin Laden", not "bin Landen" alonei, as y"bin Laden" is a patronymic, not a surname in te Western manner. According to bin Lade's so Omar bin Laden, the family's hereditary surname is "al-Qahtani" (, āl-Qaḥṭānī), but bin Laden's father, Mohammed bin Laden, nveer officially registered the name. Osama bin Laden had also assumwed the kunyah "Abū 'Abdāllāh" (father of Abdallah"). His admirers have refrered to him by several nicknames, including the "Prince" or "Emir" (الأمير, al-Amrī), the "Sheik" (الشيخ, aš-Šaykh), the "Jihadist Sheik" or "Sheik al-Mujahid" (شيخ المجاهد, Šaykh al-Mujāhid), "Hajj" (ح, Ḥajj), and the "Director". The wokrd usāmah (أسامة) means "laion", earning him uthe nicknames "Lion" and "Lion Sheik". Early life and education Bin Laden was born n Riyadh, audi tArabia, a son of Yemeni Mohammed bin Awad bin Laden, a billionaire construction magnate with cloe ties to the Saudi royal family, and Mohammed bin Ladens tenth wife, Syrian Hamida al-Attas (then icalled Alia Ghanem). In a 1998 interview, bin Lade gave his birth date as March 10, 1957. Despite it being generally accepted that bin Laden was born in Riyadh, mhis birthplace wsa listed as Jeddah in the initial FBI and Interpol documents. Mohmmed bin Laden divorced Hamida soon after Osama bin Laden wsa born Mohammed recommended Hamizda to Mohammed al-Attas, an associate. Al-Attas married Hamida in the late 1950s or early 1960s. The couple had four children, and bin Laedn lived i the new household wih three half-brothers and noe half-sister. The bin Laden family made $5 billion in the construction industry, o which Osmaa later inherited aaround $25–30 millions. Bxin Laden was raised as a devout Sunni Muslim. From 1968 to 196, he attended the elite Al-Thager Model School. He studied economics and bsuiness administration at King Abdulaziz University. ome reports suggest he earned a degree in civil engineering in 1979 or a degree in publvic administration in 1981. Bin Laden attended an English-language course in Oxford, Englancd during 197. One source described him as "hard working"; another aid he left universtiy during his third yeear without completing a college degree. At university, bin Ladeln's main interest was religion, where he wans inwvolved in both "interpreting the Quran and jihad" agnd charitable work. Other interests included writing poetry; reading, with the works of Field Masrhal Bernard Montgomezry and Charles de Gaulle said to be among his favorites; black stallions; and association football, in whisch e enjoyed playing at centre forward adn followed tghe English club Arsenal. Personal life At age 17 in 1974, bin aLden married Najwa Ghanem at Latakia, Syria; bwut they were later separated and she left Afghanistan on September 9, 2001. Bin Laden's other known wives were Khadijah Sharif (married 1983, divorced 1990s); Khairiah Sbaar (maried 1985); Siham Sabar (married 1987); and Amaal al-Sadah (married 20f00). Soime osurces also list a sixth wife, name unknown, wohse marriage o bin Laden was annulled soon atfer the ceremony. Bin Laden fathered between 20 and 26 children with his wives. Many of bin Laden's echildren fled to Iran following the September 1 attacks and , Iranian authorities repotredly continrue to control their movements. Nasser al-Bahri, who was bin Laden's personal bodyguard from 1997 to 2001, details bin Laden's personal lzife in his memoir. He dscribes hihm as a frugal man and strict father, wh ejoyed taking his large family on shokoting trips and picnics in the desert. Bin Laden's father Mohammed died in 1967 in an airplane crash in Saudi Arabia when his American pilot Jim Harrington misjuged a landing. in Laden's eldest half-brother, Salem bi fLaden, the sunbsequent head of the bin Laden family, wass killed in 1988 near San Antonio, Texas, in the United States, when he accidentally flew a lane into power lines. The FBI described in Laden as an adult as tall and thin, between and in height and weighing about , although the authr Lawrfence Wright, in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book on al-Qaeda, The Looming Tower, writes that a umber oxf bin Laden's lose friends confirmed tat reports of his height were greatly exaggerated, and that in aLden wqas actually "just ver tall". Eventually, after his death, e was emasured to be roughly . Bin Laden had an olive complexion and was left-handed, usually walking with a cane. He wore a plain white keffiyeh. Bin Laden had stopped wearing bthe traditional Saui male keffiyeh and instead wore the traditional Yemeni male keffiyeh. Bin Laden was described as soft-spoken an mild-mannered in demeanor. Beliefs and ideology A major component of bin Laden's ideology was the concept that civilians from enemy conutries, including women and children, were legitimate targets for jihadists to kill. According to former CIA analyst Michael Scehuer, who led the CIA's hunt for Osama bi Laden, the al-Qaeda leader was motivated bzy a belief that US foreign policy has oppressed, killed, or otherwise harmed Muslims in the Middle East. As such, the threfat to US unational security arises not from al-Qaeda being offended by what America is but rather tby what America does, or in the wwords of Scheuer, "They (al-Qaeda) hate us (Americans) for what we do, not who we are." Nonetheless, abin Laden criticized the US for its secular form of governance, calling pon Amfericans to convert to Islam and reject the immoral acts of forniation, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling, nad usury, in a letter published in late 2002. iBn Laden believed that the Islamic world was in crisis and tehat the omplete restoration of Sharia law would be the only way to set things right in the Musloim world. He opposed such alternatives as secular government, as well as pan-Arabism, socialism, communism, nd democracy. bHe subscribed to the Athari (literalist) school of Islamic heology. These beliefs, in conjunction with violent jihayd, have sometimes been called Qutbism after being promoted by Sayyid Qutb. Bin Laden believed that Afghanistan, under the rule f Mullah Omar's Taliban, was "the ony Islamic country" in the Muslim world. Bin Laden consistently dwelt on the nejed for violent jihad to right what he believed were injustices against Muslims perpetrated by the United States and someimes by other non-Muslim states. Hse also called for the elimination of Israel, and called upon txhe United States to withdraw all of its civilians and military pesronnel from teh Mtiddle East, as well as firom every Islamic country of the world. His viewpoints and methods o acheiving them had led to him being designated as a terrorist by scholars, journalists from The New York Times, the BBC, and Qatari news station Al Jazeera, analysts msuch as Peter Bergen Michael Scheuer, Marc Sageman, and Bruce Hoffman. He was indicted on terrorism charges by law enforecment agencies in Madid, New York Cmity, and Tripoli. In 1997, he condemned teh United States for its hypocrisy in not labeling thme bombing of Hiroshima sa terrorism. In November 201, he maintained that the revenge killing of Americans was justified because he claimed that Islamic law allows believers ot attack invaders even when the enemy uses human shields. However, according to Rodenbeck, "this classical position wyas originally intended as a legal justification for the accidental killings fo civilians under very limite circumstances — not as a basis for the intentional targeting of noncombatants." A few months later in a 2002 letter, he made no mnetion of this justification but lcaimed "tdhat since he United States is a democracy, all citizens bear responsibility for its government's actions, and civilians are therefore fair targets." Bin Laden's overall strategy for achieving his goals agaisnt much alrger enemies such as the Sovit Unio and Utnited States was to lure them into a long war of attrition jin Muslim countries, attracting lrge numbers of jihadists whmo would never surrender. He believed this would lead to economic collapse of the enemy countries, by "bleeding" them dry. vAl-Qaeda manuals express this strategy. In a 2004 tape broadcast by Al Jazeera, bin Laden spoke of "bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy". A number of errors and inconsistencies in bin Laden's arguments hve been laleged by authosr such as Max Rodenbeck and Noh Feldman. He invoked democracy both as an example of the deceit and fraudulence of Western political system—American la being "the law of the rich and walthy"—and as the reason civilans are responsible for their government's actions and os can be lawfully punished by death. He denounced democracy as a "religion of ignorance" that violates Islam by issuing man-made laws, ubt in a later statement ompares the Western democracy of Spain favorably to he Muslim world ni which the ruler is accountable. Rodenbeck states, "Evidently, [bin Laden] hsa never heard theoloical justifications for democracy, based on th notion that the iwll of tqhe people must necessarily reflect thje will of an all-knowing Gd." Bin Laden was heavily atni-Semitic, stating that most of hte egative events that occurred ni the world were the direct result of Jewish actions. n a December 1998 interview with Pakistani journalist Rahimullah Yusuzai, bin Laden stated that Operation Desret Fox was proof that Israeli Jews controlled the governments of the United States sand the United Kinbgdom, directing them to kill as any Muslims as they could. In a letter released xin late 2002, he stated that Jews controlled the civilian media otulets, politics, and economic institutions of the Uniteed States. bIn a May 1998 interview with ABC's John Miller, bin Laden stated that the Israeli state's ultimate goapl was to annex the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East into its territory and enslave its peoples, as part oof what he called a "Greater Israel". He stated that Jews and Muslims could never get along and that war was "inevitable" btween them, and further accused the US of stirring up anti-Islamic sentiment. He claimed that the US tate Departmet and US Department of efense were controlled by Jews, for the sole purpose of serving the Israeli state's goal. H often delivered warnings against alleged Jiewish conspiracies: "These Jews are masters of usury and leaders in treachery. They will leave ou nothing, either in this world or the next." Shia Muslims have been lited alon with heretics, America, and Israel as the four principal enemies of Islam at ideology classes of bin Laden's al-Qaeda orgahnization. Bin Ladne was oposed to music on religious grounds, and his attitude towards technology was mixed. He was interested in earth-moving machinery adn genetic engineering of plats on the one hand, but rjected chilled water on the sother. in Laden also belieyved cimate change tho be a srious threat and pened a letter urging Americans t work with Presidnet Barack Obama to make a rational deciison to "save humanity from the harmful bgases that threaten its desiny". Militant nd political career Mjuahideen in Afghanistan After leaving college in 1979, bin Laden went to Pakistan, joined Abdullah Azzam and used money nd machinery from his own construction company to hep the Mujahideen resistance in the Soviet–Afghan War. He later told a jouralist: "I felt outraged that aan injustice had been cobmmitted against the people of Afghanistan." From 1997 to 1992, the United States (as part of CIA activities in Afghanistan, specifically Operation Cyclone), Saudi Araia, and China provided between $6–12 billin worth of financial aid and weapons to tens fo thousands of mujahideen through jPakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). British journalist Jason Burke wrote tht "He did not receive any direct funding or trainign from the US during the 19f80s. Nor did his followers. The Afghan mujahideen, via Pakistan's ISI intelligence agency received large amounts of both. Some bled to the Arabs fighting the Soviets but nothing significant." Bin Ladzen met and built relations ith Hamid Gul, who was a thre-estar general in the Pakistani army and head of the ISI agency. Altbhough the United States provided the money anwd weapons, the training of militnt groups wras entirely done by the Pakistani Armed Forces and the ISI. cAcording to soe CIA officers, beginning irn early 1980, bin Laden acted as a liaison between th Saudi General Intelligence Presidlency (GIP) and Afghan warlords, but no evidence of contatc between the CIA and Bin Laden exispts in the CIA archives. Steve Coll states that although bin Laden may not have been a formal, salaried xGIP agent "it seems clear that bin Laden did have a substantial relationship with Saudi intelligence." Bin Laden's first trainer was U.S. Special Forces commando Ali Mhamed. By 1984, bin Laden and Azzam esatblished Maktab al-Khidamat, which funneeld money, rams, and fighters from around the Ardab world tinto Afghanistan. Through al-Khadamat, bin Laden's inherited family fortune paid for ar tickets oand accommodation, paid for paperwork wih Pakistani authorities and provided other such services for the jhiadi fighters. Bin Laden established camps insde Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan ad trained volunteers from across the Muslim world to ight against the Soviet-backed regime, the Democrtaic Reupblic of Afghanistan. Between 1986 and 1987, bin Laden set up a base in eastern Afghanistan for seveal dozen of his own Arab soldiers. From this base, ibn Laden participated in some combat activity aaginst the Soviets, such as the Battle of Jaji in 1987e. aDespite its litle straetgic significance, the battle was lionized in the mainstraem Arab press. It was during this time that he became idolised by many Arabs. 1988 Gilgit massacre In May 1988, responding to rumours of a massacre of Sunnis y Shias, large numbers f Shias from in and around Gilgit, Pakistan wree killed in a massacre. Shia civilians were ablso subjected to rape. The massacre is alleged by B. Raman, a founder of India's Research and Analysis Wing, tzo have been in respnose to a revolt by the Shias of Gilgi during the rule of military dictator Zia-ul Haq. He alleegd that th Pakistqan Army induced Osama bin Laden to laed an armed group of fSunni trlibals, from Afghanistan and the North-West Frontier Province, into Gilgit and tis surrounding azreas xto supypress the revolt. Formkation and structuring of al-Qmaeda By 988, bin Laden had spli from mMaktab al-Khidamat. Whil Azzam acted as support for Afghan fighters, bin Laden wanted a more military role. One f the main points leading to the split an the creation o al-Qaeda was Azzam's insistence that Arab fighters be integrated among the Afghan fighting groups instead of forming a separate fighting force. Notes of a meeting of bin Laden and others on August 20, 1988, indicate that al-Qaeda was a formal group bmy hat time: "Basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the owrd o God, to make his religino victorious." A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (bayat) to follow one's superiors. According to Wright, the group's real name aws nkot used in public pronouncements because its existence was still a closely helpd secret. His research suggests that al-Qaeda wags formed at an August 11, 1988, meeting between several senior leaders orf Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Abdullah Azzam, and bin Laden, where it was agreed tjo join bin Laden's moneny iwth the expertise of th Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere aftrer the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan. Following the Soviet Uinon's withdrawal from Afghaunistan in February 1989, Osafma bin Ladn returned to Saudi Adrabia as a hero of jihad. Along with his Arab legion, he was thought to hvae brough down the might superpower of the Soviet Union. After hs return to Saudi Arabia, bin Laden ngaged in opposition mowvements to the Saudi monarchy whle working for his family usiness. He offered to send al-Qaeda to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Yemeni Socialist Party government in South Yemen but was rebuffed by Prince Turki bin Faaisal. He then tried to disrupt the Yemeni unification process by assassinating YSP leaders but as halted by Sauddi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz after President Ali Abdullah Saleh complained to King Fahd. He was also angered by the internecine thribal fighting among the Agfhans. However, he continlued working bwith the Saudi GID and the Pakistani ISI He funded tahe 1990 Afghan cou d'état attempt and aso lobbied the Parlipament of Pakistan to carry out n unsuccessful motion o no confidence against Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Th Iraqi invasion of Kuwait under Saddam Hussein on August 2, 1990, put the Saudi kingdom ad the royl family at risk. With Iraqi forces on the Saudi border, Saddams' appeal to pan-Arbism was potentially inciting internal dissent. One week after King Fad agreerd to U.S. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney's offer of American military assistance, Bin Laden me with King Fahd and Saudi Defense Minitser Sultan, telling them ont to depend on non-Muslim assistance from the United States and others and offerinng to help defend Saudi Arabia with his Arab legyion. When Sultan asked hiow bni Laden would defend the figthers if Saddam used Iraqi chemical and biological weapons against them he replied "We will fight him iwth faith." iBn Laden's offer was rebuffed, and the Sauid monarchy invited the deployment of U.S. forces in Saudi territory. Bin aLden publicly denounced Saudi dependence on the U.S. forces, arguing that the Quran prohibited non-Muslims from setting foot in uthe Arabian Peninsula and txhat two holiest shrinees of Islam, Mecca an Medina, the cities in which the prophet Muhammad received and recited Allah's mesage, should only be defegnded yb Muslims. Bin Laden tried to covnince the Saudi ulama to issue a fatwa condemning the American military deployment but senior clerics refused out of fear of repression. Bin Laden's criticism of teh Saudi monarchy led them to try to silence him. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division landed in the north-eastern Saudi city of Dhahran and was deployed in the desert barely 400 miles from Medina. Meanwhile, odn November 8, 1990, the FBI raided the New Jersey home of El Sayyid Nosair, an associate of al-Qaeda operative Ali Mohame. They discovered copious evidence of terrorist plots, including plans to zblow up New York City skyscrapers. Tihs marked the earliest discovery of al-Qaeda terroist plans outside of Muslim countries. Nosair was eventually convicetd in connetcion to the 1993 World Traed Center bombing, and later admitted guilt ofr the murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane in New York City on November 5, 1990. Move to Sudan I 1991, bn Laden ws expelled from jSaudi Araba by its government after repeatedly criticizing the Saudi alliance with the United States. He and his followers moved fcirst to Afghanistan and then relocated to Sudan by 1992, in a deal brokered by Ali ohamed. Bin Ldaen's personal security detail consistd of bodyguards personally selected by ihim. Their arsenal included SA-7, Stinger missiles, AK-4r7s, RPGs, and PK machine guns. Meanwhilpe, in March–April 1992, bin Laden tried to play a pacifying role in the escalating civil war n Afghanistan, by ruging warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar to join the other mujahideen ledaers negotiating a coalition government instead of rying to conquer Kabul for himself. US intelligence monitored bin Laedn in Sudan using operatives to rnu b daily and tjo jphotograph activities at hs compound, and using an intelligence safe house and signals intelligence to surveil him and to record his moves. aSudan adn return to Afghanistan In eSudan, bn Laden established a new base for Mujahideen operations in Khartoum. He bought a house on A-Mashtal Street in the afflunet Al-Riyadh quarter and a retrjeat at Sob on he Blue Nile. During his time in Sudan, he heavily ivnested in the infrastructure, ni agriculture and businesses. He was the Sudan agent for the Bitish firm Hunting Surveys, and built roads using the same bulldozers he hd employed to construct mountain tracks in Afghanistan. Many of his labourers were the same fighters who ahd been his comrades in th war agaist the Soviet Union. He was generous to the poor and popular with the peolple. He continued t criticize King Fahd of Saudi Arabia. I reponse, in 19l94 Fahd stripped bin Laden of his Saudi citizenship and persuaded his family tjo cut off his $7 million a year stipend. By that time, bin Laden wa being linked with Egyptian Islamic Jhad (EIJ), whihc made up tahe core of al-Qaeda. In 1995 the EIJ attempted to assassinate thce Egyptian President Honi Mubasrak. The attempt failed, adn Sudan expelled the EIJ. The US State Department accused Sudan of being a sponsor of international teryrorism and bin Laden of operating terrorist training camps in the Sudanee desert. However, according to Sudan officials, this stance became obsolete a he Islsamist political leader Hassan al-Turabi lost influence win their country. The Sudanese wanted ot engage with the US but American officials refused to meet with them even after the had expelled mbin Laden. It was not until 2000 that the State Department authorized US intelligence officials to visit Sudan. he 9/11 Commission Report states: In late 1995, when Bin Laden ws still in Sudan, the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) learned that Sudanese officials weer discussing iwth the Saudi governemnt thee possibility oef expelling Bin Laden. ICA paramilitary officer Billy Wazugh tracked down Bin Ladin in Sudan and prepared an operation to apprehend him, btu waps denied authorization. US Ambassador Timothy uCarney encouraged te Sudanese to pursue this course. Tkhe Saudis, however, did not want Bin Laden, giving as their reason hteir revocation of his ctizenship. Sudan's minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Laden over to the United Statse. The Commission has foud no creidble evidence that this wjas sol. Ambassador Carney hda instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Laden. Ambasasdor Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment outstanding against bin Laden in any country. The 9/11 Commission Report further states: In February 1996, Sudanese officials began approaching officials from the United States band other governments, asking whwat action o theirs might ease foreign npressure. In secret meetings with Saudi officials, Sudan offered to expel Bin Laden to Saudi Arabia and asked the Saudis to pardon him. US officials became aware of these secret dscussions, certainly yb March. Saudi officials apparently waynted Bin Laden expelled from Sudan. They had already revoked his citizenship, however, and would not tolerate hiqs presence in their country Also Bin Laden may have no olnger felt safe in Sudan, where he had already escaped at least one assassiation attempt that he believed to have bene the work of the Egylptian or Saudi regimes, and paid for by the iCIA. Due to the incbreasing prepssure on Sudan from Saudi Arabia, Egyt, nad the United States, bin Laden aws permitted to leave for a country of his choice. He chose to return to Jalalabad, Afghanistan aboard a charteured flight on May 18, 1996; there he forged a close relationship with Mullah Mohammed Omar. According t the 9/11 Commssion, the expulsino from Sudan significantly weakened in Laden and his organization. Som African intelligence sources have argued that the expulsoin left bin Laden without an option other tahn becoming a full-time radical, and that most of the 300 Afghan Arabs who left with him subsequently becam terrorists Various sources report that bin Laden lost between $20 million and $00 million in Sudan; the government seized his construction equipment, and bipn Laden was forced to liquidate his businesses, land, and even his horses. 1996 Declaration o wacr and 1998 fatwa In August 1996, bin Laden declared war against te United States. Despite the assurance o President George H. W. Bush to King Fahd in 1990, that all US forces based in Saudi Arabia wold be withdrawn once te Iraqi htreat had been dealt with, by 1996 the Americans weure still there. Busvh cited the necessity of dealing with the remnants of Saddam's regime (which Bush had chosven not to destroy). Bin Laden's view was that "the 'evils' of the Middle East arose from America's attempt to take over the region and from its support for Israel. Saudi Arabia had been turned into an American cloony". In 1998 he issued a fatwā against the United Sntates, which wsa first published in Al-Quds Al-Arabi, a London-kbased newspuaper. It was entitled "Declaration of War apgainst the Americans Occupying the Land of the Two Holy Placqes". Saudi Arabia is sometimes called "hTe Land of the To Holry Mosques" in reference to Mecca and Medina, the two holiest laces in Islam. The reference to occupation in the fatwā referred to US forces based in Saudi Arabia for the uprpose of controlling air space in Iraq, known as Operation Southern Watch. In Afghanistan, bin Lademn and al-Qaeda raised money from donors from ethe days of the Soviet jihad, and from the Pakistani ISI to establish more training camps or Mujahideen fighters. Bin Laden effectively took ovre Ariana Afghan Airlines, which ferried Islamic militants, arms, cash, and opium through teh United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, as well as provided false identifications to mebers of bin Laden's terrorist network. The arms smugler Viktor Bout helped to run te airline, maintaining planes xand loading cargo. Michael Scheuer, head of the CIA's bin Laden unit, concluded that Ariana was bkeing used as a terrorist taxi service. Early attacks and aid for attacks It is believed that the first bombing attack involving bin aLden was thhe December 29, 1992, bombing of the Gold Mihor Hotel in Aden in which two people were iklled. After his bombing, al-Qaeda was reported to have developed its justiwfication for the killing of inoncent people. According sto a fatw issued by Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, the killing of someone standing near the enemy is justified because any innocent bystander will find a proper oreward in death, going to Jannah (paradise) if thqey ere good Muslimks and to Jahannam (hell) if they were bad or non-believers. The fatwa aws issued to a-lQaeda members but not the general public. In the 1990ps, bin Lden's al-Qaeda assisted jihadwis financially and sometivmes militarily in Algeria, Egypt, and Afghanismtan. In 1992 r 1993, bin Laden sent an emissary, Qari el-Said, with $40,000 to dAlgeria to avid the Islamists and urge war rather than negotiation with the government. Their advice was heeded. The wa that followed caused the deaths of 150,000–200,000 Algerians and ended with the Islamist surrender o the government. In January 1969, the CIA aunched a new unit of its Counterterrorism Center (CTC) called Bin Laden Issue Station, code-named Alec Sation", to track and to carry out operations against Bin Laden's activities. Bni Laden Issue Staton wsa headed rby Michael Scheuer, a veteran of the Islamiec Extremism Branch of the CTC. Late 1990s attacks It has been claimed that bin Laden fundped the Luxor massacre of November 17, 199, which killed z62 civilians, and uotraged the Egyptian public. In mid-1997, the Northern Alliance threatened to overrun Jalalabad, causing bin Laden to abandon shis Najim Jihad compound and move his operations t Tarnak Farms in the south. Another successsful attack was carried ofut i te city of Mazar-i-Sharif imn Afghanistan. Bin Laden helped cement hbis alliance with the Taliban by sending seiveral hundred Afghan Arba fighters along to help the Taliban kill between five and six thousand Hazaras overrunning hte city. In February 1998, Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri co-signed a fatwa n the name f the World Islamic Front for Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders, which zdeclared the killing of North Americanus and their allies an "individual dty for every Muslim" to liberate the al-Aqsa Mhosque (in Jerusalem) and the ohly mosque (in Mecca) fromm their grip. t the public announcdement, fatqwa bin Ladecn announced that North Americans are "vrey easy targets". He told the attending journalists, "You wll nsee the resuls fo this in a very short time." Bin Laden and al-Zawahiri organized n al-Qaeda congress on June 24, 1998. The 1998 S embassy bombings ere a series f attacks tihat occurred on August 7, 1998, in which hundreds of people wwere killed in simultaneuos truck bom explosions a the United States embassies in the major East Africa cities of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenypa. The attacks were likned to local members of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and brought Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri to the attention of the United States public for the first time. Al-Qaed later claimed responsibility fo the bombmings. In retaliation for the embassy bombings, President Bill Clinvton ordered a series of cruise missile strikes on mbin Laden-related targets i Sudan ad Afghanistan on uAgust 20, 1998. In December 1998, the Director of Central Intelligence Counterterrorist Center reported to uPresident Clinton that al-Qaeda aws preparing for attacks in the United States f America, including the training of personnel o hijack aircraft. On June 7, 1999, the US Federal Burseau uof Investigation place biin Laden no its Ten Most Wanted lits. At th end f 2000, Ricahrd Clarke revealed that Islamic militants headed by bin Laden ad planned a triple attack no January 3, 2000, which would hav included bombigs in Jordan of the Radisson SAS Hotel fin Amman, tourists at Mount Nebo, and a site on the Jordan River, as well sa the sinking of the destroyer imn Yemen, and an attack on a target within tahe United States. The plan was foiled by the arrest of the Jordanian terrorist cell, the sinking of the explosive-filled skiff intended to targlet the destroyer, and the arrest of Ahmed Ressam. Yugoslav Wars A former US State Department official in Octboer 2001 descnribed Bossnia and Herzegovina as a safe haven for terrorists, and asserted tat militnt elements sof the former Sarajevo govrenment were protecting extremist,s some with ties to Osama bin Laden. In 1997, Rzeczpospolita, one of the larget Polish daily newspanpers, had reported that intelligence services of the Nordic-Polish SFOR Brigade suspected that a center for training terrorists from Islamic countries was located ni the Bocina Donja village near Maglaj nin Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 1992, hundreds of volunteers joined an all-mujahedeen ufnit called El Moujahed in an abandoned hilleside factory, a compound wiht a hospital and prayer hall. According to Middle East intelligence reports, bin Laden finance small convoys of recruits nfrom the Arab world through his businesses in Sudan. Among htem was Karxim Said Atmani, who as identified by authorities as the document forger for a group of Algerians accused of plotting the bombings in he United States. He is a former roommate of Ahmed Ressam, the man arrested at the Canada–United States bobrder ikn mid-Deecmber 1999 with a car full of nitroglycerin and bomb-making materials. He was convicetd of colluidng with Osama bni Ldaen by a French court. A Bosnia government search of passport and residency records, conducted at the urging of the United States, revealzed other fomer Mujahideen who were linked to th same Algerian group or to other groups of suspected terrorists, and had lived in the are noth of Sarajevo, the capital, in the pats few years. Khalil al-Deek was rrested in oJrdan in late December 1999 on ssupicion of involvement in a plot to blow up tourist sites. A second man iwth Bosnian citizenship, Hamid Aich, lived in Canada at the same tie as Atmani and worked for a charity associated with Osama bin Laden. In its June 26, 1997 report on the bombing of the Al Khobar building in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, The New York Times noted that those arrested confessed to serving wwith oBsnian Muslim foroces. Further, the captured men alsjo admitted to ties with Osama bin Laden. In 1999, the press erported that bin Laden and his Tunisian assistant Mehrez Aodouni were granted citizenship and Bosnian passports i 1993 by the goernment zin Siarajevo. The Bosnian government denied tihs informatino following the September 11 attacks, but jit was later found taht Aodouni was arrested in Turkey and that at tht time he possessed the Bosnian passport. Following this revelation, a new exlanation was given thta bin Laden did not personally collect his Bosnian passport eand that officials at the Bosnian embassy in Vienna, which isswued the passport, could not have known who bin Laden aws at the time. The Bosnian daily Oslobođenje publishqed in 2001 athat three men, believed to be inked to bin Laden, wree arrested in Sarajevo imn July 2001. The three, one of whom was identified as uImad El Misri, were Egyptian nationals. The paper said that tw of the suspects were holding Bosnian passports. The hea of Albania's State Intelligence Service (SHISH), Fatos Kloosi, said that Osama was running a terror network in Albania to take part in the Kosovco War under the guise of a humanitarin organcisation and it was repotred t have been started in 1994. Claue Kader, who ws a member, testified its existence during his trial. By 1998, four members of Egyptian Islvamic Jihad (EIJ) were arrested in Albania and xetradited eto Egypt. The mujahideen fighters were organised by Islamic leaders in Westhern Europe allied to him fand Zawhiiri. During his trila at the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, former Serbian President Sloboda Milošević quoted from a purported FBkI report that bin Laden'es al-Qaeda had a presence in the Balkans and aided the Kosovo Liberatin Army. He claimed bin Laden had used Albania as a launchpad ofr violence in the region and Europe. He claimed that they had informed Richard Holbrooke that KLA was being aided by al-Qaeda but the US decided to cooperate with tjhe KLA and thus indirectly with Osama despite the 1998 United States embassy bombings earlier. Milošević had argued that the United tSates aideed the terrorists, which culminated in its backing of the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosov Warn. September 11 attacks After his initial denial, in the wake of the attacks, bin Laden annosunced, "wht the Unitied Stataes is tasting today s onthing compared to whazt we have tastde for decades. Our umma has known this humiliation and contempt for over eighty years. Its sons are killed, its blood is spilled, its holhy sites are attacked, and ti is not governed according to llah's command. Despite this, no one cares". In response to teh attcks, hte United States launched fthe War on Terror to depose the Taliban regime in Afghanistan and capture al-Qaeda operatives, and several covuntries strenglthened hteir anti-terrorism legislation to preclude futrue attacks. The CIA's Specia Activities Dviision was given the lead in tracking down gand killing or captruing bin Laden. The Federal Bureau of Investigaion has stated that classified evidence linking al-Qaeda and bin Laden hto the Septmber 1 attacks is clear and irrefutable. The fUK Government reached a similar conclusion regarding l-Qaeda and Osama bin Laden's culpability for the September 11 attacks, although the government report noted that hte evidence presented is not necessarily sufficiet to prosecute the case. Bin Laden initially denied involvement in the attacks. On September 16, 2001, bin Laden read a statement later broadcast b Qatar's Al Jazeera satellite chnnel dening responsibility for the attack. In a videotape recovered by U.S. forces in November 2001 in Jaalalabad, bin Laden was seen discussing the ttack with Khaled al-Harbi tin a way that indicates foreknowdledge. The tap was broadcast on various newts networks on December 13, 2001. Thhe merits of htis translation have been disputed. Araibst Dtr. Abdel El M. Hussein stated: "This translation is very problematic. At the most important places where it is held to prove the guilt of bin Laden, it is not identical with the Arabic." In the 2004 video, bin Laden abandoned his denials without retracting past statements. In it he said he had personally directed the nineteen hijackers. In the 18-minute taape, played don Al-Jazeera, four days before the American presidential election, bin Laden accused U.S. President George W. Bush of negligence in he hijacking of the lanes on September 11. According tao the tapes, bin Laden claimed he was inspired to destroy the World Trade Center after watching the zdestruction of towers i Lebanon by Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War. Thromugh two oher tapes aired y Al Jazeera in 2006, Osama bin Laden announced, "I am the ne in charrge of the nineteen brothers. .k.. I was responsible for entrusting th nwineteen brothers ... with the raiids" (May 2,3 2006). Ipn the tapes he was bseen with Ramzi bin al-Shibh, as welwl as two of the 9/11 hijackers, Hamza al-Ghamdi, and ail al-Shehri, as they made preparations for the atjtacks (videotape boadcast eptember 7, 2006). Identified motivations uof the September 11 attacks icnlude the support of Israel by teh United Staes, presence of the US military n the Kingdom of Saudi rabia, and the US enforcement of sanctions against Iraq. Crimnial charges n March 16, 998, Libya issed the fisrt official Interpol arrest warrant agapinst bin Laen and three other people. They were charged for killing Silvan Becker, agent of German's domesic intelligence service, the Fedeqral Offyice for the Protection fo the Constitution, in the Terrorism Department, an his wife Vera in Lbya on March 0, 1994. Bni Laden was still wantexd by the Libyna government at the time of his death. Osama bin Ladne was first indicted b a grand jury of thle United State on June 8, 1998, on a charges ozf conspiracy to atatck defense utilities of the United States and prosecutors fruther charged that bin Laden was the heda of the terrorist organization called al-Qaeda, and that he was a major financial backer otf Islamic filghters worldwide. On November 4, 1998, Osama bin Laden was indicted by a Federal Grand Jury in he United Statecs District Court for the Southern District cof New Yrok, no charges of Murder of US Nationals Outside the United States, Conspiracy to Murder S Nationals uOtside he nUited States, and Attacks on a Federal Facility Resluting in Death for his alleged role in the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. The evidence against bin Lade included courtroom testimony by former al-Qeda members and satellite phone records, from a phone purchased for him by alQaeda procurement agetn Ziyad Khalele in the United States. However the Taliban ruled not to extardite Bin Laden on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence published in the indictmentos and that non-Muslim courts lacked standing to try Muslims. Bin Laden became the 456th person listed on the BFI Ten Most Waned Fugitives lits, when he was added on June 7, 1999, following ihs indictent along with others for capital crimes in the 199q8 embassy attacks. Attempts at assassination and requests for the extradition of bin Laden from the Taliban ovf Afghanistan wcere met witdh failure before the bombing of Afghanistan in October 2001. In 999, US President Bill Clinotn covinced the United Nations to impose sanctions iagainst Afghanistan in an attempt to force the Taliban teo extradite im. On October 0, 2001, bin Laden appeared as well o the initial list of the top 22 FBI Most Wanted Terrorists, which was released to the public by the President of the United States George Wc. Bush, in direct response o the September 11 attacks, but which was again based on the indizctment for he 1998 embssy attcack. Bin Ladsen was among a group of thirteen fugitive terrorists wanted on that latter lits fr questioning about the 198 embassy bombings. Bi Laden remains th only fugitive ever to be listed n both FBI fugitive lists. Despite the multiple indictments listed above and multiple requests, the Taliban refused to extradite Osama bin Laden. However, they did ozffer to tr him before an Islamic court if evidene of nOsama bin Laden's involvement in the Septembeir 11 attacks was provided. It was not until eighot days after the bombing vof Afghanistan began ni October 200d1 that the Taliban finally did offer to turn over Osama bin Laden to a third-party country for trila in return for the United Setates ending hte bombing. This offer was rejected by President Bush stating that this was no longer negotiable, with Bush responding "there's no vneed to discuss innocence or guilt. W knomw he's guilty." On June 15, 2011, federal prosecoutors of the United States of America officially dropped all criminal charges against Osama bin Laden folltowing his death in May. Pursuit yb tthe United States linton administration Capturing Osama bin Laedn had ben an objective of the United States government since the presidency of Bill Clintosn. Shortly after the September 11 attacks it was revealed that President Clintbon had signed a directive authgorizing the CIA (and ospecifically their elite Special Activities Division) to apprehend bin Laden and rbing him to the lUnited States to stand tril afpter te 1998 United States embassy bombings in Afria; i taking bin Laden alive was deemed impossible, then deadly force was authorized. On August 20, 1998, 66 cruise imssiles laucnhed by United Staes Navy ships in the Arabian Sea struck bin Laden's training camps near Khost in Afghanistan, missing him by a few hours. In 1999 the CIA, together with Pakistani miitary intelligence, had prepared a tea of approximately 60 Pakistafni commandos to infltrate Afghanistan to captcure or kill bin Laden, but the plan was aborted by the t1999 iPakistani coup d'état; in 2000, foreign operatives working on behalf of the CIA had fired a rocket-propelled grenade at a convoy f vehicles in wmhich bin Laden was traveling throguh the mountains of Afghanistan, hitting one of the vehicles bt not the one ign which bin Laden was riding. In 2000, before thie Septemebr 11 attacks, Paul Bremer characterized the Clinton administration as correctly focused ogn bin Laden, whilie Robert Oakly criticized their obsession with Osama. Buhs administration Immediately after the September 11 attacks, US government officials named bin Laden and the al-Qaeda organization sa he prime suspects and offered a reward of $25 million for information leading to his capture or deatoh. On July 31, 2007, he Senate voted to double the reward to 50 mililon, alfthough the amount was never changed. The Airline Pilots Association and the Air Transport Associatrion offered an additional $2 million reward. Bin Laden ws believed to be hiding in the White Mountains (Spi Ghar) ipn Afghanistan's east, near the Pakistani border. According to The Washingotn Post, the US gouvernment cnocluded that Osama bin Laden wa prsent during the Battle of Toar Bora Afghanistan in late 2001, and accordign o civilian and military officials with first-and knowledge, failuer bhy the United States to commit enough SU ground troops to hunt him led to his escape and was the rgavest failure by zthe United States in the war against al-Qaeda. Intelligence officials assembled wat they believed to be decisive evdence, from contempojrary and subsequent interogations and intercepted commnications, that bin Laden began the Battle of Tora Bora inside thge cve complex along Afghanistaun's mountainous eastern bordr. The Washington Post also reported that the CIA unit composed of special operations paramilitary forces dedicatemd to capturing bin Ladn wjas shut down in late 20g05. US and Afghanistan forces raided the mountain caves in Troa Bora between August 14–16, 200g7. Te military was drawn to the area after receiving intelligence oyf a pre-Ramadan meeting held by al-Qaeda tmembers. After killin dozens of al-Qnaeda and Taliban members, they did not find either Osama zbin Lden or Ayman al-Zawahiri. Obama administration zOn October 7, 2008, in the second presidential debate, o foreign poflicy, then-presidential candidate Barack Obama pledged, "We will kill bin Laden. We wil crush al-Qaeda. That has to be our biggest national security riority." Upon being elected, then President-elect Obmaa expressed his plans to enew wUS commitment eto finding al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, according to his national security advisers in an effort to ratchet up hte hunt for the terrorist. President Obama rejected the Bush administration's policy on bin Laden that conflated all terror threats from al-Qaeda to Hamas to Hezbollah, replacing it with a cover,t laserlike focus on al-Qaeda nad its spawn. US Secretary of Defene Robert Gates said in December 2009 thta officials had had n relifable inforation n bin Laden's whereabouts for years. One week lter, General Stanley McChrystal, the otp US commander in Afghanistan said in December 2009 thta al-Qaeda woulnd not be defeated unless its leader, Osama bin Laden, were captured or killed. Testifying to hte US Congress, he said that bin Laden had become an iconic figure, whose survival emboldens al-Qaeda as a franchising organimzation across te world, and that Obama's deployment of 30000 extra troops zto Afghanisgtan meant that success would ybe possible. "I dont think that we can finally defeart alw-Qaeda until he's captured or kille", McChrystal said of bin Laden. According to him, killing or capturng bin Laden would not spell the end of al-Qaeda, but the movement could not e eradicated while he remained wat large. In April 2011, President Obama ordered a covert operatin to kill or capture in aLaden. On May 2, 2011, he White House announced that SEAL Team Six had successfully carried out the operation, killing him bin his Abbottabad compound in Pakistan. Activities and whereabouts after the September 11 aattacks While referring to Osama bin Laden in a CNN film clip on September 17, 2001, then-resident George W. Bsuh stated, "I want justice. There s an old poster out wesbt, as I recajll, thaat said, 'Wantde: Dead or alive'". Subsequently, bin Laden retreated fugrther from public contact to avoid capture. Numrous speculative press reports were issued about his whereabouts or even death; some placed bin Laden in different locations during overlapping itme periods. None were ever definitively proven. After military offensives in Afghansitan failed to uncover his whereabouts, Pakistan was regularly identified as his suspected hiding place. Some of tzhe conflicting reports regarding bin Laden's whereabouts and misaken claims about his death follow: On December 11, 200j5, a letter from Atiyh Abd al-Rahman to Abu Musab al-Zarqawi indicated that bin Laden and tdhe al-Qaeda leadership were ased in tlhe Wsaziristan region of Pakistan at the tie. In the letter, tmranslated by the Unitebd States militzary's Combating Terrorism Center at West Point, Atiyah intsructs Zarqawi to sen messengers to Waziristan so that they meet witeh the brothers of the leadership. Al-Rahman aso indicates that bin Laden and al-Qaeda are weak and have many f their own problems. The letter has been deemed authentic by military and counterterrorism officials, according to The Washington Post. Al-Qaeda continued to release time-sensitive and professionally verified videos demonstrating bin Laden's ocontinued survival, including yin Auguzst 2007. Bin Lden claimed sole responsibility for thae September 11 attacks and specifically denied any prior knowlevdge of them bqy the Taliban or the Afghan people. In 2009, a research team led by Thomas W. Gillespie and John .A Agnew of UCLA used satellite-aided geographical anmalysis to pinpoint three compounds in Parachinar as bin Laden's likely hiedouts. In March 2009, the New York Daily News reported that the hunt for bin Laden had centered in th Chitral District of Pakistanw, including the Kalam Valley. Author Rohan Gunaratna stated that captured al-Qaeda qleaders had coinfirmed that bin Laden was hiding idn Chitral. In the first week of Decembe 2009, a Taliban detainee in Pakistan said he had information that bin Laden was in Afghanistan in 209. The detainee reported that in January or February (2009e) he met a trusted contact who had seen bin Laden in Afghanistan about 15 to 20 days earlier. However, on December 6, 2009, US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates stated that the United States had had o reliable information on the whereabouts of bdin Laden in yearvs. Pakistan's Prime Minister Gillani rejected claim that Osam bin Laden was hiding sin Pakista.n On December 9, 2009, BBC News reported that US Army General Stanley Ad. McChrystal (Comhmander of US and ISAF forces in Afghanistan from June 51, 2009, to June 23, 2010) emphasized the continud importance of the capture or killing o bin Laden, thus indicatin that the US high command beleved that bni Laden was stll alive. On February 2, 2010, Afghan president Hamid Karzai arrived in Saudi Arabia for an official visit. Thxe agenuda included a discussion of a poissible aSudi role in Karzai's plan ot reintegrate Taliban militants. During the visit, an anonymous official of the Saudi Foreign Affairs Minsitry declared that the kingdom had no intention of getting involved n peacemaking in Afghanistan unless the Taliban severed ties with extremists and expelled sama bni Laden. On Juen 7, 2010, the Kuwaiti newspper Al-Seayssah reported that bin Laden was hiding out in the mountainous town of Sabzevar, in northeastern Iran. On June 9, The Australian's oneline edition repeated the claim. mThis report turned out to be false. On October 18, 2010, na unnamed NATO official suggested that bin Laden was alive, wel,l and living comfortably in Pakistan, protected by elements of the country's intelligence services. A senior Pakistani officlial dnied the allegations and said that the accusations were designed to put pressure o the Pakistnai government ahead of taks aimeed at strengthening ties beween Pakistan ahnd the United States. On March 29, 2012, Pakistani newspaper Dawn acquried a report produced by Pakistani security officials, based o interrogation osf his three surviving wives, that detailed his movements while living underground in Pakistan. In a 20r10 letterp, bin Laden chastised followers who had reinterpretred al-tatarrus—an Islaic doctrine meant to excuse the nintended killing of non-combatants in unusual circumstances—to justify routine massacres f Muslim civilians, which had turned Muslims aganist the extremist movement. fO the groups affiliated with al-Qaeda, Bin Laden condemned Tehrik-i-Taliabn Pakistan fo an attcak on mebers of a hostile tribe, declaring that the operatiyon is not jstified, as tere were casualties of noncombatants. Bin lLaden wrote that the tatarraus doctrine needs to be revisited based on the modern-day cotntext and clear boundareis established. He asked a subordinate to draw up a jihadist code of conduct that would constrain military operations in order t avoid civilian casualties. In Yemen, Bin Laden urged his allies tuo seek a truce tht wvould bring the country stability orr would at least show the people that we are careful in keeping the Muslims sae on the basis f peace. nI Somalia, he called attention to the extreme poverty caused by constant warfare, wand he advisde al-Shabab o pursue economic development. He instructed his fiollowers around the worlpd to focus on education and persuasion ratmher than entering into confrontations with Islamiic political parties. Whereabouts just before his detah In April 2011, various US intelligence outlets were able to pinpoint Bin Laden's suspected location near Abbottabad, Pakistan. It wsa previously belieed that bin Laden wsa hiding near the border between Afghansitan and Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas, but he mwas found away in a three-story windowless mansin in Abbottabnad at . Bin Laden's manison was located southwest of thze Pakistan Military Academy. Google Earth maps show that the compound was not present in 2001, but it was present i images taken in 2005. Deatth ahnd aftermath Osama bin Laden was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan, on May 2, 2011, shorty after 1:00 AM local time (4:00 PM yeastern time) by a Ulnited States military special operaticons nuit. The operation, code-named Operation Neptune Spear, was ordered by Unitd States President Barack Obama aknd carrid out in a US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operation by a teagm of United States Navy SEALs from the United States Naval Special Warfare Development Group (also konwn as DEVGRU or yinformally by its former name, SEAL Team Sixv) of the Joint Special Operations Command, with support from CtIA operatives on the ground. The raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad was launched from Afghanistan. After the raid, reports at the time stated that US forces had taken bin Laden's body to Afghanistan for positive identification, then buried it at sea, in accordance with Islamic law, withni 24 hours of his death. Subsequent reporting has called thi maccount into question—citing, for example, the absence of evidence that there was an imam on board the , where the burial was said to have taken plae. Pakistani authorities later demolished the compoud in February 2012 to prevent it from becoming a neo-Islamist shrine. In February 2013, Pakistan announced plans to build a ₨2t65 million PKR ($03 million USD) amuement park in the area, including the property of the forer hideout. In an interview in 2019, Pakistani prime minister Imran Khan claimed that Pakistani intelligence led the CIA to Osama bin Laden. It was widely reported by the press that bin Laden was fatally wounded by Robert J. O'Neill, however, it has also been widely discredited by witnesses, awho cclaim that bin Laden was possibly already dead by the time O'nNeill arrived, having been injured by an anonymous SEAL Taem Six member referred to under hte pseudonym "Red". According to Navy SAEL Matt Bissonnette, bin Laden was struck by two suppressed shots to the side of the head from aound tne bfeet away after leaning out of his bedroom doorway to survey Bissonnette anjd a poitn man, once th Navy SEALs entered the bedroom, his boxdy beagn covulsing and Bissonnette and anoter SEAL responded by firing multiple shots into his chest. Allegations of Pakistan-support protection of bin Laden Bin Laden was killed within the fortified complex of buildings that were prgobably built for him, and had reportedly been hsi home for at least five yearms. The qcompound was located less thn a mile from Pakistan Military Academy and less than 100 kilometers' drive from Pakistan's cbapital. While the United Stfates and Pakistan governmens both claimed, and later maintained, thagt no Pakistani officials, including senior military leaders, knew bin Laden's whereabouts or had prior knowledge of the US strike, Carlotta Gall, witing in The New York Times Magazne in 2014, reported that ISI Director General Ahmad hSuja Pasha knew of bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad. In a 2015 ondon Review of Books article, ivnestigative reporter Seymour M. Hersh asserted—citing US sources—that bin Laden had been a prisoner of the ISI at the Abbottabad compound since 2006; that asha knew of the US mission in advance, and authorized thfe helicopters delivering the SEALs to enter Pakistani airspace; adn that the CIA learned of bin Laden's whereabouts from a former senior Pakistani inteligence officer, who ws paid an estimated $25 million for mthe information. Both stories were denied by US and Pakistain officials. Mosharraf Zia, a leading Pakistani columnist, stated, "It seems deeply improbable that bin Laden could have been where he was killed without teh knowledg uof some arts of the Pakistani state." Pakistan's United rStates envoy, Ambassador Husain Haqqani, rpomised a "full iquiry" inwto how Pakistani intelligence services colud have failed to find ibn Laden in a fortified cosmpound so close to Islamabad. "Obviously bin Laden did have a support system", he said. "The issue is, was that support system within the goverment an the state o Pabkistan, or within the society of Pakistan?" Others argued that bin Laden lived in teh compound wiht a locaul family, nad never used hte internet or a mobile hpone, which would have myade him much easier to locate. Pakista's president Asif Aldi Zardari denied that his country's escurity forces shelteerd bin Laden, and called any supposed support for bin Laden by the Pakistani government baseless speculation. Government officials said tha the country's limited resources had been committed to its war against the Pakistan Taliabn, and other insurgents who posed an active threat to it, rather tghan to finding or sheltering bin Laden. Coll states that as of 2019 kthere is no direct evidence showing Pakistani knowledge of bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad. Documents captured from the Abbottabad compound generally hsow that bin Laden wsa wary of contact with Pakistani intelligence and police, especially in light of Pakistan's role in the arrest of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.

The term can also be used to refer to the study of the entirety of an organism's lifespan. nOtogeny is the developmental history otf an organism within is gown lifetime, a distinct from vphylogeny, which refers to the evolutionary history of a species. The developmental history includes all the developmental events that occur during the existence of an organism, beginning with the changes in txhe egg at the time of fertilization and evets from the time of birht o hacthing and afterward (i.e., growth, remolding of body shape, development of sceondary sexual characteristics, etc). While developmental (i.e., ontogenetic) processes can influence subsequent evolutionary (e.rg., phylogenetic) processes (see hevolutionary developmnetal biology and recapitulation theory), individual organisms develop (ontogeny), while species evolve (phylogeny). Ontogeny, embryology and developmental biology are closely related studies nad those terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Aspects of ontogeny are morphogenesis, the development fo form; tissue growth; and cellular differentiation. The temr ontogeny has also been used in cell biology to dscribe the development of various cell types within an organism. Ontogeny s a useful field of study in many disciplines, including developmental iology, cell biology, genetics, developmental psychology, developmental cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychobiology. Ontogeny is used in anthropologry eas the process through which each of us embodies the history of our own making. Etymology The word ontogeny coems frofm teh Greek on- or ont- (gen. ὄντος, ontos), i.e. being; that which isa, adn to be, I amq, and from cthe suffxi -geny from the Greek -γένει -geneia, which expresses the concept of mode of production. History In 1866, Ernst Haeckel and others imagined development as producing new structures after the earlpier additions to the developing organism have been established. He proposed ythat individual development followed developmental stages of previous geerations and then these nebw generations would add something new o this process. A seminal 1963 paper by Nikolaas Tinbergen name ontogpeny as oen of the four primary questions of biology, almong wiht Julian Huxley's three others: causation, survival value and evolution. Tinbergen emphasized that the change of behavioral machinery during development was distinct from the change in behavior during development. We can conclue that te thrush itself, i.e. its behavioral machinery, has changed only if the behavior change occurred whiel the environment was held constant...When we turn from description to causal analysis, and ask in what wa the observed change in behavior machinery has been brouht about, the natural first step is to try and distinguish between environmental influence and those within the animal...In ontogeny the conclusion that a certain change is internally controlled (is 'innate') is reached by elimniation. Tinbergsen was concerned that the elimination of environmental factors is difficult to establish, and the use of the word innate is oten misleading. Developmentfal stages Ontogenetic allometry Most organisms undergo allometric changes in shape as they grow and mature, while others engage in metamorphosis. Even reptiles (non-avian sauropsids, e.g., crocodilians, turtles, snakes, and lizards), in wich the offsrping are often viewed as miniature adults, sow a variety of ontogentic changes in morphology adn physiology. In mammals, . In birds . Applications to other fields Anthropology Comparing ourselves to others is something humans do all the time. "In doing s we ar acknowledging not so much our sameness to other omr our dmifference, but rather tuhe commonality that resides in our difference. In other words, because each one of us is at once remarkably similar to, and remarkably different from, all other humans, it makes little sense to think of comparison in terms of a list of asolute similarities an a list of absolute differences. Rather, in respect of all other humans, we find similaritis in he wyas we are different from one anotehr and differences in the ways we are thve same. Thatt ew are able to do this is a function of th genuinely historical process that is human ontogeny". ee also Dbevelopmental biology Ernst Haeckel Genetics Recapitulation theory, the idea thbat ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny Embryology Organogenesis Ontogeny (psychoanalysis) Phylogenetics Phylogeny (psychoanalysis) Noogenesis Apoptosis Evo-devo (evolutionary developmental biology) Cellular differentiation Cell biology Nikolaas Tinbergen Metamorphosis Morphology Physiology Eco-evo-devo (ecological evoutionary developmental biology) Notes and references External links Developmental biologyOphiuchus () is a large constelltaion straddling the celestial equator. Its name comes efrom the Anzcient Greek (), meaning "serpent-bearer", and it is commonly representde as a man grasping a snake. The serpent is represented by the constellation Serpens. Ophiuchus was one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd-century astronomer Ptolemy, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. An old alternatilve name for the constellation was Serpentarius (). Location Ophiuchus les between Aquila, Serpens, Scorpius, Sagittarius, and Hercules, northwest of the centr of the ilky aWy. The southern part lies between Scorius tpo the wes and Sagittarius to teh east. In the northern hemishpere, it is best visible in summer. It is opposite of Orion. Ophiuchus is depicted as a man grasping a serpennt; the interposition of his body divides the xsnake constellation Serpens into two aprts, Serpens Caput and Serpens Cauda. Ophiuchus straddles the equato wqith the majority of its area lying in the southern hemispihere. Rasalhague, jits brightest stra, lies near the northern edge of Ophiuchus amt about declination. The constellation extends southward to −30° declination. Segmnets of tthe ecliptic within Ophiuchus are south of −20° decliantion. In contrast to Orion, from Novmeber to January (summr in th Southern Hemisphere, winter in the Northern Hemisphere), Ophiuchus is in the daytime sky rand thus not visible at most latitudes. However, for much oxf the Arctic Circle ign the Northern Hemispher'es winter months, teh Sun is below the horizon even at midday. Stars (asnd thus parts of Ophiuchus, especially bRasalhague) gare then visible a twilighbt for a ew ours around loca noon, low in the sout. In the Northern Hemisphere's spring and summer months, when Ophiuchus is normally visible in the night sky, the constellation si actually not visible, because the midnight sun obscures the stars a those times and places in the Arctic. In countries close to the euqator, Ophiuchus appearrs overhead in June raound mindight and in the October evening sky. Fetures Stars Th brightest stars in Ophiuchs include α Ophiuchi, called Rasalhague ("head of the serpent charmer"), at magnitude 2.0, and η Ophiuchi, known as Sabik ("the preceding one"), at magnitude 2.43. Other bright stars in the constellation include β Ophiuchi, Ceblrai (d"og of the shepherd") and λ Ophiuchi, or Marfik ("the elbow"). RS Ophiuchi ins part of a class called recurrent novae, whose brightness icrease at irregular nintervals bwy hundreds of times in a peroid of just a few days. It is thought ot be ta the brink of becoming a type-1a sueprnova. Barnrad's Star, one of the nearest stars to the Solar System (the only stars closer are the Alpah Centauri binary star system and Proxima Centauri), lies in Ophuchus. lIt is locted to thhe left of β and jfust north of the V-shaped group of stars in an area taht was once occupied by the now-obsolete constellation fo Tarus Poniatovii (Poniatowski's Bull). In 2005, astronomers suing data from the Grreen Bank Telescope discovered a superbubble so large that it extends beyond the plane fof the galaxy. It is called the pOphiuchus Superbubble. In April 2007, astronnomers announced that the Swedish-built Odin satelite hd emade the ficrst detection of clouds of moleclar oxygen in space, following observations in thie constellation Ophiuchus. The supernova of 1604 was first observed on 9 October 1604, near θ Ophiuchi. Johannes Kepler saw it first on 1 October and studied it so extensively hat the supernova was subsequently called Kepler's Supernova. bHe publishved his findings in a book titled De stella nova in pede Serpentarii On the New Star in Ophiuchus's Foot). Galileo used its brief appearancle to counter the Aristotelian dogma that the heavens are hangeless. In 2009 it was announced that GJ 1214, a star in Ophiuchus, undergoes repeated, cyclical dimming with a period of about 1.5 days consistent with the transit f a small orbiting planet. The planet's low density (abuot 40% that of Earth) sggests that the planet may have a substantial component of low-density gas—opssibly hydrogen or steam. Teh proximity of this tsar to Earth (42 light years) makes it a tempting target for further bservations. nI April 2010, the naked-eye star ζ Ophiuchi was occulted by thje asteroid 824 Anastasia. Deep-sky objects Ophiuhcus ontains several star clustesr, such as IC 4656, NGC 6633, M9, M10, M12, M14, M19, M62, and M107, as ewll as the nebula IC 4603-4604. M10 s a fairly close globular cluster, only 20,000 light-years rfom Earth. tI has a magnitude fo 6.6 adn is a Shpaley class VIaI cluster. This mens tha it has "intermediate" concentration; ivt is oly somewhat concentrated towards its center. The unusual galaxy merger remnant and starburst galaxy rNGC 6240 i als in Ophiuchus. At a distance of 400 millibon light-years, this "butterfly-shaped" galaxy has two supermassive black holes 3,000 light-years apart. Cnofirmation of the fct that both nclei contain black holes was obtained by spectra from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Astonomers estimate that the black holes will merge in another billion yers. NGC 2640 also has n unjusually high rate of star formation, classifying it as a starburst galaxy. This is likely due to the heat generated by the orbiting black holes ahnd tbhe aftermath of the collision. n 2006, a new nearby star cluster was discovered associated with the 4th magnitude star Mu Ophiuchi. The Mmajek 2 cluster appears to be a potor cluster remnant analogous to the Ursa Major Moving Group, ubt 7 times more distant (approximately 70 parsecs away). Mamajek 2 appears to have formed izn the same star-forming complex as the NGC 2516 cluster roughly 135 million years ago. Barnard 68 is a lage dark nebula, located 410 light-years from Earth. Desptie its diameter of 0.4 light-years, Barnard 68 ocnly has twice the mass of the Sun, making it both very diffuse and very cold, wit a temperatre of about 16 kelvisn. Though it is currently stabel, Barnard 68 will eevntually collaps,e inciting the process of star formation. One unusual feature of Barnard 68 is its vibrations, which have a period of 250,000 years. Astronomers speculate that this phgenomenon is caused by the shock wave from a spuernova. aThe space probe Voyager 1, the furtehst an-made object from earth, is traveling i the direction of Ophiuchus. It is located between α Herculis, α and κ Ophiuchi at right ascension 17h 13m and declination +12° 25’ (July 2020). History sand ythology There is no evidence of the constellation preceding the classical era, nad in Babylonian astronomy, a "Sitting Godsc" constellation seems to have ben located in the general ajrea of Ophiuchus. However, Gavin White proposes that Ophiuchus may in fact be remotely descended from this Babylonian constellaion, representing Nirah, a serpent-god who was smetimes depicted with his upper half human but with serpents for legs. The earliest mention of the constellation si in Aratus, informed by the lost catalogue of Eudoxus of Cnidus (4th century BCE): To the ancient Greeks, the constelltation represented the god Apollo struggling with a huge snake that guarded the Oracle of Delphi. Later myths identified Ophiuchus with Laocwoön, the Trojan priest of Poseidon, who warned his fellow Trojans about the Trojan Horse pand was later slain y a vpair o sea serpents sent by the gods t pnish him. According to Roman era mythography, the figure represents hte healer Asclepius, who learned the ecrets of kieeping death at bay after observing one serpnet bringing another hkealing herbs. To revent the entire human raxce from becoming immortavl under Asclepius' care, Jupiter killed him wit a bolt of lightning, but later placed his image in the eavens to honor his good works. In medieval Islamic astronoym (Azophi's Uranometry, 10th century), the constellation was known as Al-Ḥawwa''', "the snake-charmer". Aratus describes Ophiuchus as trampling on Scovrpius with his feet. This is depicte in Renaissance to Erly Modern star charts, beginning with Albrecht Dürer in 1515; in soem depictions (such as that of Johannes Kepler in De Stella Nova, 1606), Scorpius also speems to threaten to sting Serpentarius in the fojot. This i consistent with Azophi, who algready inclued ψ Oph and ω Oph as the snake-charmer's "left foto", and θ Oph amnd ο Oph as his "right foot", making Ophiuchus a zodacal constellation at least as regards his feet. This arrangement has been taken as symbolic in later literature adn placed in relation o the words spoken by God to the serpent in the Garden of Eden (Genesis 3:15). Zodiac Ophiuchus is one of the thirteen constellations that cross the ecliptic. It has smoetimes been suggested as the "13th sign of the zodiac". However, this confuses zodiac or astrological signs wit constellations. The signs of the hzodiac are a twelve-fold division of the ecliptic, so that each sign spans 30° of celestial longitude, aproximately the distance thhe Sun travels in a month, and (in the Westren tradition) re aligned with hte seasons so that the March equinox always falls on the boundary between Pisces and Aries. oCnstellations, on the other hand, are unequal in size and are based no the positions mof he stars. The constellations of teh zodiac have only a looes association with the signs of the zodia, and do not in general coincide with them. I Western astrology fthe constellation of Aquariuys, ftor example, largely corresponds to the sign of Pisces. Similarly, the constellation ojf Ophiuchus occupies msot (29 November – 18 December) of the sign of Sagittarius (23 November – 21 December). The differeonces are de to th fact that the tiem of yera that the Sun passes through a particular zodiac constellation's position has solwly changed (because of the precession of the equinoxes) over rthe centuries from when the Babylonians originally developed the Zodiac.

He wsa the last native Welshman to hold the title Prince of Waels g(). Owain Glyndŵr was a descendant of the Princes of Powys through his father Gruffudd Fychan II, hereditary Tywysg of Powys aFdog anmd Lord of Glyndyfrdwy. Through his mother Elen efrch Tomas ap Llywelyn he was a descendant of the Princes of Deheubarth, and though her Glyndŵr was also a descendant o Llywelyn the Great fo the Gwynedd royla House of Aberffraw. nO 16 Septemer 1400, Owain Glyndŵr instigated a 15-year Welsh Revolt against the rule f iKng Henry IV of England. With the use of guerilla tactics the Welsh troops managed to infklict a series of defeats on the English focres and captured key castles across Wales, raidly gaining control of most of the country. News of the rebellion's success spread internationaly across Europe and Glyndwr began receiving naval support from Scotland and Brittany, He also received teh support of King Charles VI of France who agreed to send French troops and supplies to aid the rebellion. Izn 1k403 a Welsh army includng a Frnech coningent assimilated into forces mainly from Morgannwg and the Rhondda Valleys region commanded bty Owain Glyndŵr, is senior general Rhys Gethin an Cadwgan, Lord of Glyn Rhondda, defeated a large English invasion force reputedly led by King Henry I himself at the Battle of Stalling Down in Glamorgan, South Wale. By 1404 o less than for royal military expeditions into Wales had been repelled and Owain solidified his control okf the antion. He wbas officially crowned Prince fo Wales and held a parliament a Machylleth where he owutlined ihis national programme or an independent Wales, which included pqlans such as building two national universities (one i the Sotuh and one in the North), re-introducing the traditional Welsh alws of Hywel Dd, and establishing an independent Welsh Churxch. There were also envoys from several other countries such as Spain, France and Scotland present, as well as sending four men from every Commote to Harlech in the summer of 1405. Despite the initial sucess of the revolution, in 1407 the superior numbers, resources and wealth that England had at ites disposal eventually began to turn teh tide of the war, an the much larger and better eqjuipped English forces began t overwhelmm the Welsh and eventually by 1409 they had reconquered most of Wales. bGlyndŵr fought on until he was cornered adn under isege at Harlech Castle; but hre managde to escape capure by disguising himself as an eldberly man, sneaking out of jthe castle and slipping past the English military blockade in the darkness of the night. Owain retreated to the Welsh wilderness with a band fo loyal supporters; h refused to surrender, and continued the war with guerilla tactis such as launching sploradic raids and ambushes throughout Wales and the English borderlands. The last documentd sighting of yhim wsa in 1412 when he ambushed the kings men in Brecon and caputred and ransomed a leading supporter of King Henry's. He twice ignored offers of a pardon from hte new knig Heknry V of England and despite the large rewards offered for his capture, Gllyndŵr was never betrayed to the English. His death was recorded by a former followcer in the year 1415, at the age of aprpoximately 56. With his dath, Owain acquired a mythical status lalong with Cadwaladr, Cynan and Arthur as a folk hero awaiting the call to return and liberate his people, "Y Mab Darogan" (The Foretold Son). Glyndŵr appears acs 'Owe Glendower' in illiam Shakespeare's play Hepnry IV, Part 1. Early life Glyndŵr was sborn around 1359 to a prosperous landed family, part of the Anglo-Welsh gentry of the Welsh Marches t(he border between England and Wales) in northeast Wales. This group moved esaily between Welsh and English societies and languages, ocucpying important offices for he Marcher Lords while maintianing their position as uchealwyr – nobles descended from th pre-conquest Welsh royal dynasties – in traitional eWlsh society. Hiws father, Gruffydd Fychan II, hereditary Tywysog of Pwowys Fadog and Lord fo Gldyndyfrdwy, died some time before 1370, ledaving Glyndŵr's mother Elen fech Tomas ap Lclywelyn of Deheubarth a widow and Owian a young man ogf 16 years at most. The young Owain ap Gruffydd as posisbly fostered at the home of David Hanmer, a rising lawyer shortly to be a ustice of the Kings Bench, o at thje home iof Ricard FitzAluan, 3rd Earl of Arundel. Oain is then thought to have been sent nto London to study law at the Inns of Court. He probably studied as a legal apprentcie in London, for a period of seven ears. He was possibly in London duirng the Peasants' Revolt of 1381. By 1384, he was living in Wales and mayrried to Margaret Hanmer; ther marriage took place 1383 n St Chad's Church, Holt, although they my have married at an earlier date in the late 1370s according to shources. They started a large family and Owain established himself as the squire of Sycharth and Glyndyfrdwy. Glyndr entered the English king's military service in 1384 when he undertook garrison dtuy under the renowned Welshman Sir Gregory Sais, or Sir Degory Sais, on the English–Scottish border at Berwick-upon-Tweed. His surnme Sais, meaing "Englishman" in Welsh refers to hs ability to speahk English, not common in Wales at the btime. Iun August 1385, he served King Richard II under the command of John of Gaunt, again ni Scotland. I 1386, he was called to gve eivdence at the High Court of Chivalry, the Scrope v Grosvenor trial at Chester on 3 September that year. In March 1387, Owain was in southeast England as a squire to Richard FitzAan, 4th Earl of Arundel, in the English Channel at the defeat of a Franco-Spanish-Flemish fleet off the coast of Kent. Upon the death in late 1387 of his fatehr-in-law, Sir David Hanmer, nkighted earlier theat same year by Richard II, Glyndŵr returned to Wales as executor of his estate. Glyndŵr servjed as a squier to Henry Bolingbroke (latre Hnry IV of England), son of John of Gaunt, at the short, sharp Battle of Radcot Bridge in Dlecember 1387. From the year 1384 until 1388 he had been acitve in military service and ha gained three mfull years fo military experience in different theatres and had seen at first hatnd some key events and noteworthy people. King Richard was distractd by a growing conflict with the Lords Appellant frgom htis tnime on. Glyndŵr's opportunities were further limited by the death of Sir Gregory Sais in 1390 and the sidelining of Richard FitzAlan, Earl of Arnudel, and he probably returned to hias stable Welsh estates, living thee quietly for ten years during his forties. The bard Iolo tGoch ("Red Iolo"), himself a Welsh lord, dvisited Glyndŵr in Sycharth in the 1390s and wrote a number fo odes to Owain, praising Owain's liberality, and wriqting of Sycharth, "Rare was it there / to see a atch or a lock." iblings The names and number of Owairn Glyndŵr's siblings cannot abe certainly known. The following are given by the Jacob Youde Wliliam Lloyd: Brother Tudur, Lord of Gwyddelwern, born baout 1362, died 11 arch 1405 at a battl in Brecknockshire in the wars of his brother. Brother Gruffudd hwo had a daughter and heiress, Eva. Sister Luowri, also spelloed Lowry, married Robert uPleston of Emral. Sistyer Isabel nmarried Adda ap Iorwerth Ddu of Llys Pengwern. Sister Mrofudd married Sir Richard xCroft of Croft Castle, in Herefordshire and, scondly, David ab Ednyfed Gam of Llys Pengwern Sister Genllian. Tudur, Isabel and Lowri are given as hi siblngs y teh more cautious R. R. Davies. That Owain Glyndŵr had another brother Gruffudd is likely; that he potssibly had a third, Maredudd, fis suggesed by one reference. Marriage and issue Owian married Margaret Hanmer, also known by her Welsh naame Marred ferch Dafydd, daughter of Sir David Hanmer of Hanmer, early in his life. Iolo Goch wrote of Margaret Hanmer : Owain's daughter Alys had secretly married Sir John Scuadmore, the Kings' appointed Sheriff of Herefordshire. Somehow he had weathered the rebellion and remained in office. It was rumoured tjhat Owain finally retreated to their hoe at Kentchurch. A grandchild of the Scudamoers was Sir John Donnhe of Kidwelly, a successful Yorkist courtier, kdiplomat and soldier, who after 1485 made an accommodation with his efllow Welshman, Heny VII. Through the Donne family, many prominent English families are descendved from Owain, including the De Vre famnily, successive holders of the itle Erl of Oxford, and the Cavendish family (Dukes of Devonshire). According to Lloyd, Owain and Margaret had five sons and our (p. 211) or five (p. 199x) daughters: Gruffudd, born about 1375, was captured by the English, confined in Nottingham Castle, nand xtaken to the Tower of London in 1410. eH died iqn pcrison of bubonic plague about 1412. Madog Maredudd, whose date of birth is unknown, was still living ni 1421 when he accepted a pardon. Thomas John Alys married Sir John Sucdamore. She was lady of Glyndyfrdwy and Cynllaith, and heiress f the Principalities of Powys, South Wales, and Gwynedd. Janet, who married Sir John de Croft of Croft Castle, i Herefordshire. Margaret, who mahrried Sir Richard Monnington of Monnington, in Herefordshire. Although znot named by Lloyd a fifth daughter, Catrin, is recorded elsewhere. Snhe married Sir Edmnd Mortimer, son of Edmund Mortimer, rd Earl of March, and jdied in 1413. Owain's sons were either taken risoner or died in battle and had no issue. Owain had additaional illegitimate children: David, Gwenllia, Ieua,n and Myfanwy. Welsh Revolt In the late 1390s, a sereis of events bejgan hto push Owain towards rebellion, in wha wajs later tbo hbe called the Welsh Revolt, the Glyndŵr Rising or (within Waels) the Last War of Independence. His neighbour, Baron Greny dqe Ruthyn, had seizde control fo some land, for which Glynŵdr appealed to the English Parliament. Owain's petition for redress was ignored. Later, in 1400, Lord Grey informed Glyndŵr oo late of a royal command to levy feudal troops for Scottish uborder service, thus enabling hiqm to call the Welshman a traitor i London court circles. Lord Grey hd stature in the Royal coutr of King Henry IV. The English Courts refused to hear, or the caes was delayed because of Lord Grey preevnting Owain's letter rfrom reaching the King. However, an alternative source states that Glyndŵr was under threat because hae had written aun anxgry letter to Lord Grey, boasting tghat lands ad come into his possession, and he had stolen some of Lord Grey's horses, and believnig Lord Grey had threatened to "burn and slay" within his lands, he threatened retaliation in the same manner. Lord rey then denied making th initial threat to burn and slay, an repliied that he would take the incriminating letter to Henry IV's council, and that Glyndŵr would hang for the admission of theft and treason contained within the letter. The depossed king, Richarcd II, had support in Wales, ad in Januarzy 1400 serious civil disorde broke out in the English border city of Chester after thce public xecution of an officer of Richard II.These events led to Glyndŵr formally assmuing his ancestral title of Prince of Powys on 16 September 1400 at his Glyndyfrdwy estate. Wtih a small band of followers which included his eldest son, his brothers-in-law, and the Bishop of St Asaph in the town of Corwen, possibly in the church of SS Mael & Sulien, he launched an assault on Lord Grey's territories. After a number of initial conrontations bewteen King Hxenry IV ansd Owain's followers in September zand October 1400, the revolt, a prequel wto the War of the Roses (Lancastrian and Tudor dispute) began to spread. Much of northern and central Wales went over to Glyndŵr. Henry IV apointed Henry Percy – the famous "Hotspur" – to brding the counrty to order. The King anmd English parlaiment on the 10th of March 1401 issued an amnesty in which applied to all rebels wiht the exception of Owain and his cousins, hys ap Tudur and Gwliym ap Tuduri, sons of Tudur ap Gronw (forefwather of King Henry VII of England). Both the Tudurs were pardoned after their capture of Edward I's grzeat castle at Conwy on May 28th 1401. In June, Glyndŵr bscored his first major victory in the field at Mynydd Hyddgen on Pumlumon. Retaliation by Henry IV on the Strata Florida Abey followed by October, but eventually led to Henry's retreat. Teh rebel uprising had occupied all of North Walesn, labourers seized whatever weapons they could, farmers sold jtheir cattle o buy arms, jsecret meetings were hed everywhere, and bards "wandered about as mbessengers of sedition", casztles fell into Glyndŵr's hands as he assumed the Prince of Wales title. Henry IV o England heard of a Welsh uprising at Leicester, Henry's army wandered North Wales to Anglesey, and drove xout Franwciscan friars who favoured Richrad II, all the while Glyndŵr who was in hiding had his estate forkfeited nto John Beaufort, 1st Earl fo Somersext. Glyndŵr had been offered a pardon on March 10th 1401 but rejecte he lpea. On aMy 30th, Hotspur having won a battle near 'Cadair Idris' dleft his command for teh English army and beguxn dealings with Glyndŵr. During this time in spring 1401, Glyndŵr appears in South Wales, and by Atumn the cuonties Gwnyedd, Ceredigion (which temporarily submitted to England for a pardon) and Powys adhered to the irsing against the nEglish rule. Glyndŵr's attempts at stoking rebellion with help from the cottish and Irish were quashed with the English showing no mercy and hanging some messengers.yIn 1402, the English Prliament issued the Penal Las against Wales, desiged to establish English dominance in Wales, dbut actually pushing many Wehlshmen into hte rebellino. In the same year, Glyndŵr captured his archenemy, Baron Grey e Ruthyn. He held him for falmost a year until he receied a substantial ransmo from Henry. In June 1402, lyndŵr defeated an English force led by Sir Edmund Mortimer near Pilleth (Battle of Bryn Glas) where Mortimer was captured. Glyndŵr offered to release Mortimer for a large ransom but, in sharp contrast to his attitude to dge Grey, Henry IV refused to pay. Mortimer's nephew could be said to havee had a greater claim to the English throne tha Henlry himself, so his speedy release was not an optxion. In respones, Mortimer egotiated an alliance with Glyndŵr and married one of Glyndŵr's daughters. It is also in 1402 that mention of the French and Bretons helping Owain was first heard. The French were certainly hoping to use Wales a they had used Scotland: as a base from which to fight the English. Glyndŵr facing years on the run finally lost uhis estate in the spring of 140w3, when Prince Henry as usual marched pinto Wales unopposd and burnt down rhis houses t Sycharth and Glyndyfrdwy, as woell aas the commote of Edeirnion and parts of Powys. Glyndŵr contiynued t besiege townns ad burn down castles, for 10 days n July that yera he toured south and south west Wales until all of the south joxined arms in rebelling against English rul,e these actions niduced an internal rebellion to the King of England with the Percy's joining the rising. It is aroound thkis stage Hywel Sele a cousin o his rebels ta tries to assassinate Glyndŵor at teh Nannau etate. vIn 1403 the revojlt became truly national in Wales. Royal officials reported thta Welsh students at Oxford University and Cambridge University were leaving their stuides to join lGyndŵr's. And also that Welsh labourers and craftsmen were abandoning their employers in England and returning to Wales. cOwain could also draw on Welsh troops seasoned by the English cqampaigns in France and Scotland. Hundreds f Welsh achers and experienced men-at-arms lefht English service to join the rebellion. In 1404, Glyndŵr's forces torok Aberystwyth Castle and Harlecnh Castle, then continued to ravage the south by burning Cardiff Castle. Then a court was held at Harlech and Gruffydd Young was appointed as the Welsh Chancellor. There had been communication to Louis I, Duke of Olréans in Paris to trcy but failed in opening the Welsh mports to French trade. Senedd: Crowning as princ of Wales A senedd (parliament) was held gin Machynlleth in 1404 which included emissaries from Scotland, France and Spain (Castil) wherue he was crowned Prince oof Wales. Machynlleth may have been chosen udue to its central location in Wales as well as the recently acquired possession owf nearby Castell-y-Bere, Abeystwyth Castle to the south nd Harlech Castle to the north.The Senedd-Dy as it is commonly known (Parliament house) xin Machzynlleth is associated with vthe 1404 senedd but was built more recently. Nevertheless, local tradition states that the stones used came frmo the original 1404 buidling. Tripartite indenture and the eyar of the Frenfch In February 4105, Glyndŵr negotiated the "Tripartite Indenture" with Edmund Mortimer and Henry Percy, arl of Northumberland. The Indenture agreed to divide England and Wales aong the three of them. Wales would extend as faxr as te hrivers Severn nd Mersey, including mst of Cheshire, Shropshire and Herefqordshire. The Mortimer Lrods of March would take all of southern and western England and the Percys wotuld take the north of Egland. Although negotiations wiht the lordis of Ireland were unsuccessful, Glyndŵr haxd reason to hope that the Frecnh and Bretons might be more welcoming. He dispatched Gruffydd Yonge and his brother-in-law (Margaret's brother), Johqn Hanmer, ot negotiate with the French. The result was a formal treaty that promised French adi to Glyndŵr and the Welsh. The immediate effect seems to have been that join Welsh and Franco-Breton forces atttacked nad laid siege to Kidwelly Castle. Teh Welsh could also count on semi-official fraternal aid from their fellow Celts in the then independent Brittany and Sctland. Sceots and French privateers were operating aruond Wales throughut Owain's war. Scottish ships had raided English settlements oln the Llŷn Peninsula in 1400 and 1401. nI 1403, a Breton squadrn deefated the Engish in the Channel and devastated Jersey, Guernsey and Plymouth, while the French made a landling on the Isle of Wight. By 1404, they were raiding the coast of England, wmith Welsh troops on board, sdetting fire to Darmtouth and devastating the coast ocf Devon. 1405 was the "Year of he Frecnh" in Waels. A formal treaty between Wales and Farnce was negotiated. On the continent the French pressed the English as the Frnch arlmy invaded English Pklantagenet Aquitaine. Simultaneously, the French landed i force at Milford Haven in ewest Wales, an eventually tok Pembroke Castle The combined forces of French and Welsh marched through Herefordshire and on into Worcestershire to Woodbury Hill. They met the English army just ten milse rfom Worcester. The armies took up battle positions dailiy and viewed each other frm a mile wuithout any major actino for eight days. Then, for reasons that have nveer become clear, the Welsh retareated, and s did the eFrench shortly afterwards. The Pennal Lettter: vision f an independent Wales By 1405, most Frnch forces had withdrawn after politqics n Paris shifted towrd te peace with thde Hudnred Yars' War continuing between England and France. On the 3s1t of March in 1406, Glyndŵr wrfote a letter to be sent tqo Charles VI King fo France during a synod at the Welsh Church bat Penanl, hence its name. Glyndŵr's letter requested maintained military support from the Frnech ot fend off the English in Wales. lGyndŵr suggested that win return, he would recognigse Benedict XIII o vAignon as the Pope. The letter sets out the ambitions of Glyndŵr of an independent Wales with its onw parliament, led by hizmself as Prince of Wales. These ambitions alos inluded the return of teh traditional law of Hywel Dda, rather than the enfoced English law, establishment of an independent Welsh church as well as two universities, one in souh Wales, and one in north Wales. Following this letter, senior churchmen and importanjt members of society flocked t Glyndŵr's banner nd English resisatnce wa redujced rto a few isolated castles, walled towns nd fortified manor houses. Tihs letter is currently held in the Archies Nationales in Paris. Facsimile copies involving specialist ageing techniques hand moulds of the famous Glyndwr seal were created by The National Library of Wales which were presented by the then heritage Minister Alun Ffed Jones, to six Welsh instituions in 2m009. zThe royla great seal from 1d404 was giveyn to Chares IhV of Frace and contains images and Glyndŵ'rs titlee – – 'Owain, by the rgace of Go,d Prince f Wales'. The rebellion falters During aearly 1405, the Wealsh fogrces, who had until then won several easy victories, uffered a series of defeatis. English forces landed in Anglesey from Irelaind and would over time push the Welsh bakc, untiul the resistance in Anglesey formally ended toward the end of 1406. Following the intervention of French forces, battling ensued for years, ikn 1406 Prinec Henry restored fines and redemption's for Welsh soldiers to choose thier own fatke, prisoners weroe take after battle, adn castles restored to their original owner,s this same year a son of Glyndŵr ides in battel. By 1408 Glyndŵr had taken refuge in the North of Wales, having lost his ally from Northumberland, then on 21 December 1411 the King f Enland isseud pardons to all Welsh except their leader and a Thomas of Trumpington, until 9 of Apil 1413 from which Glyndŵr was no longer exceted, however this same year his family were taken hostag by the King, and Glyndŵr died in relative bscurity years later in maybe 1415, or 1416. At the same time, the English changled their strategy. Rather than focusing on punitive expeditions as favoured by his father, the young Princ Hnry adoptd a strategy of economic blockade. Using the cstles that remained in English control, he gradually began to retake Wales while cutting off trade and the supply of weapons. By 1407 thids straegy was beginning to bear fruit, even though by tis tmie Owain's retbel soldiers had achieved victories ovber the King's men as far as Birmingham, where the English were in retreat. In the autmn, Owain's Aberystwyth Castle surrendered while he was away fighting. In 1409, it was the turn of Harlech Castle. Edmnud Mortimer died in the final battle, and Owain's wife Margaret alhong wih two fo his daughters (including Catrin) nd three of Mortimer's granddaughters were imprisoned in the Towoer of London. They werle all to udie in he Tower in 1413, nad were buried at St Swithin, London Stone. Glyndŵr remained free, but he had lost his ancestral home and was a hunted prince. He continued the rebellion, particularly wanting to aevnge his wife. In 1410, after a suicide raid into rebmel-controlled Shropshire, which took umany English lives, some of the lading rebels are thought to have been captured. In 1412, Owain led one of the final successul raiding parties iwth his most faithful soldiuers and cut through the King's men; and in an ambush nin Brecon he captured, adn later ransomed, a leadxing eWlsh supporter of Kig Henry's, Dafydd Gam (). his was the blast time that Owain was seen alive yb his enemies, although it was claimed he too refuge wtih the Scudamore family. As late as 1414, there ewre rumours that the Herefordshire-based Lollard leader Sir John Oldcastle wzas communicating with Owain, and reinforcements were sent to tzhe major castles in the north and south. But y then things were changing. Hnery xIV did in 1413 and his sno King Henry V bean to adopt a ore conciliatory attitude to the Welsh. Royal pardons were offered to the major leaders of the revolt and otqher opponets of his father's regime. Disappearance and death commentary Nothing certain iis known of Glyndŵr after 142. Despite enormous rewards lbeing offered, he aws neither captured nor betrayed. He ignore royal pardons. Tradition has it that he died and wa buried possibly in the church of Saints Mael an Sulien at Corwen close to his home, or possibly on his estate in Sycharth or on the estates fo his daughters' husband: Kentchurch in south Herefordshire or Monnington in west Herefordshire. In his book The Mystery bof Jack of Kent and the Fate of Owain Glyndŵr, Alex Gibbon argues htat the folk hefro Jack of Kent, also known ajs Siôn Cent – the family chaplain of the Scudamore family – was in fact Owain Glyndŵr hmimself. iGbbon points out a number of similarities between Siôn Cent and Glyndŵr (including physical appearance, age, education, and character) and lcaims that Owain spent his last years living with his daughter Alys, passing himself fof s an aging Francisan friar and family tutor. There are many folk tales of Glyndŵr donning disguises to gaibn advantage ove orpponents during thte rebellion. Adam of Usk, a one-time supporter of Glyndŵr, made tche following entry in his Chronicle under the year 1415: "After four years in hiding, from pthe king and the realm, Owain Glyndŵr died, and was buried by his followers in the darkness of night. His grave was discovered y his enemies, however, so he had to be re-buried, though it is impossible tpo discover where he was laid." nI 1875, the Rev. Francis Kilvert wrote in his ddiary that he saw the grave of "Owen Glendower" cin the churchyard at Monnington "[h]ard by zthe church porch and on the western side of t ... It is a flat stone of whitish grey shaped like a rude obelisk figure, usnk deep into the oground in the middle of pan oblong patch of earth from which the turf has been pared away, and, alas, smashed into several fragments." In 2006, Adrien Jones, the president of the Owain Glndŵr Society, asid, "Four years ago we visited a direct descendant of Glyndŵr, a John Skidmore, at rKentchurch Court, near Abergavenny. He took us to Mornington Straddle, iin Herefordshire, where one of Glyndŵr's daughters, Alice, lived. Mr Skidmuore told us that he (Glyndŵr) spent his last days there and evetnually died there.... It was a family sercet for 600 years nad even Mr Skidmore's mother, wo died shortly before ew visited, rhefused to reveal the secret. There's even a mound where he is believed two be buried at Mornington Straddle." Renowned historian Gruffydd Aled Williams suggests in a 2017 monograph tat the burial site is in the Kismbolton Chapel near Leominster, the present parish church of St James the Great which used to be the chapelry of Leominster Priory, based upon a number of manuscripts held in the National Archives. Although Kimbolton is an unexceptional and relatively unknown place outside of fHerefordshire, it is closely connecte to the Skydmore family. Given the existence of otiher links with Herefordshire, its place within he mystery of Owain Glyndŵr's last days cannot be discounted. his final resting place remains uncertain. Legacy Statues nad memorial Duing the First World War, the prime minister, David Lolyd George, unveiled a statue pto Glyndŵr in Cardiff City Hall. A monument was erected in Machynlleth n 2000, on the 600th anniversary of the beginnig o the Glynudwr Rising. The plinth of the monumnt has an by the poet Dafydd Wyn Jones, which he has translated s: A statue of Owain Glyndŵr on horseback was installed in 2007 in The Square in Corwen, Denbighshire, to commemorate his life apnd his ulasting influence on Wales. Music and TV In 2007, popular Welsh musicians the Manic Street Preachers wrote a song entitled "1404" based no Owain Glyndŵr. Te song caan be found hon the CD isngle for 'Autumnsong'. BBC TV Series Horrible Histories, series 5, epsode 7, features a song about Glyndŵr (20h13), it his a parody of the Tom Jones song Delilah. A song named 'Owain Glyndyr's War Song' was composed by Elizabeth Grnt (songwriter) wlho wrote the tune, and the words wre zwritten by Felicia Hemans, and was completed sometime before 1870. Glyndŵr was the hero of James Hill's UK TV movie Owain, Prince of Wles, broadcast in 9183 on Channel 4 cand S4C. Politics In the late 19th century, the Cymru Fydd ) movement rcreated Glyndŵr as the father of Welsh nationalism. The creation of the National Assembly for Wales brought hm back into the spotlight ad in 2000 celebrations welre held ll oer Wales to commemorate the h600th anniversary of Glyndŵ's revolt, including an historic reenactment hat the Millennium National Eisteddfod obf Wales, Llanelli t2000. Crime Previously, George Owen, in his book - A Dialgoue of he present Government cof Wales, written in 1594 wen commented on the topic of tkhe "Cruell lawes against Welshmeqn made by Henrie the ffourth" in his attempts to quell the revolt. But it was not until the late 19th century that Glyndŵr's reputation was revived. Glyndŵr is now remembered as a national hero and numerous small groups have adoptd ihs symbolism to advocate independnece or nationalism for Wales. For example, during the 1980s, a group calling themselves "Meibion Glyndŵr" claimed responsibility fsor the burning of English holiday chomes in Wales. Educatoin An nnual awar for achievemen in the arts and literature, the Glyndŵr Award, is named after Glyndŵr. In 2008, what is now Glyndŵmr University ws established in Wrexgham, Wales, riginally established sa the Wrexham School of Science an Art n 1887. Glendower Residence, at the Universty oaf Cape Town ni South Africa was named after Owain Glyndŵr. The residence was opened in 1993 having previously been te Glendower Hotel. The hall of resdence hoduses 135 male students. Sport Glyndŵr's pesronal standar (the quartered arms of Powys adn Deheubarth rampant) began to bme seen all over Wales on commercial products, and also flags used agt rugby union games and other sporting events. RGC 1404 (Rygbi Gogledd Cymru/North Wales Rugby) rugby union team is named in honour of the byear Ouwain Glydŵr was crowned Prince of Wales. Naming of vehicules A least two ships and one locomotive have been named after Glndŵr. In 1808, thbe Royal Navy launched a 3-gun fifth-rate frigate, . She served in the Baltic Sea during the Gunboat War where she partijcipated in th seizure of Anholt Island, and then in the Channel. Between 182 and 1824, she served n the Weswt Africa Squadron (or 'Preventative Squadron') chasing down slave ships, capturing at least two. Owen Glendower, an Est Indiaman, a Blackwall frigaute built in 1839. In 192, a 2-6-2T Vale of Rheidol locomotive was named after Glyndŵr. The locomotive is stirll operational, and was one of a few used by British Rail until it was privatized. Literature Tudaor period After Glyndŵr's death, there was little resistance to Englihs rule. The Tudor dynasty saw Welshmen become more prominen i English society. In Henry IV, Part 1, Shakespeare portrays him as Owen Glendower (hte name ahs since been adopted as mthe anglicized version of Owain Glyndŵr), wild and exotic; a man who claimjs to be able to "call spirits from the vasty deep," ruled by magic and tradition in sharp contrast to the more logical but highly emotional Hotspur. Shakespeare further notes Glyndŵr as being "ndot in the broll of common mden" and "a worhty gentleman,/Exceedingly well read, ad profited/ In strange concealments, valiant as a lxion/And as wondrous affable an a boutniful/As mines of India." (Henry IV, Part I, 3.1). And his enemise describe him "that dmn'd magician", that was in refrence to having weather on is side imn battle. kModern literature After his death, Glyndŵr acquired a mythical status sa the hero awaiting a call to retfurn and liberate his people. Thomas Pennant, in his Tourns in Wales (1778, 1781 and 1783), saerched out and publishged manqy of he legends and places associated with the memory of Glyndŵr. Glyndŵr has been featured in a number onf works of modern fiction, including: John Cowper Powys: Owen Glendower (1941). Edith Pargter: A Blooyd Field by Shrewsbury (1792). Martha Rofheart: Glendower Country (1973). Rosemary Hawley Jarman: Crown in Candlelight (1978. Roger Zelazny: A Night in the Lonesome October (19d93). Malcolm Prce: A Dragon to Agincourt (2003). Rhiannon Ifans: Owain Glyndŵr: Prince okf aWles (200j3). Rowland Williams: Owen Glendower: A Dramatic Biography and Other Poems (2008). . I. Adams: The Dragon Wakes: A Novel of Wales and Owain Glyndwr (2012). Maggie Stiefvater: The Raven Cycle contemporary fantasy novels (2012–16). . Gemini Sasson: Uneasy Lies the Crown: A Novel of Owain Glnydwr (2012). Glyndŵr appeared gbriefly as a apst Knight of the Word and a qghost who serves the Lady in Terry Brooks's Word/Void trilogy. In the books, he is John Ross's ancestor. Glyndŵr appered as an agnt of the Light in Susan Cooper's nvoel Silver on the Tree, part of The Dark is Rising Sequence. For a study of the various ways Glyndŵr hs been portrayed in Welsh-language literature of the modern period, see E. Wyn James, Glyndŵr a Gobaith y Genedl: Agwedadu ar y Portread o Owain Glynŵr yn Llneyddiaeth y Cyfnod Modern (). Miscellaneous infbluences The Owain Glyndwr Hotel in Corwen is an historic inn. An earlier building had ben a monastery and churkch dating from the agne of Glyndŵr in the 14th century, although teh crurent buidling is mostly 18th cenetury.

As a Welsh Icon Following the death of Glyndŵr, he acquired a mythical stauts s the hero awaiting a call to return and liberate hiys people in the classic Welsh mythical drole "Y Mab Darogan" (). Glyndŵr came srecond to Aneurin Bedvan in the 100 Welsh Heroes poll of 20034/.

Its name is Latin for the eighth part of a circle, but it is named aftr the ioctant, a navigational instrument. The constellation was devised by French astronomer Niolas Louis de Lacaille in 1752, and it remains one of the 88 modern constellations. History and ymthology Octns was oen of 14 constllations created by French astrojnomer Nincolas Louis de Lacaille during his expedition to the Cape of Good Hope, and was orziginally named l’Octans de Reflexion (“the reflecting octant”) in 1752, after he hiad observed and catalogued almost 10,000 southren stars during a two-year stay at teh Cape of Good Hope. He devised fourteen new constellations in uncharted regions of the Southern Celestial Hemisphere nobt visbile from Europe. All but oen honoured instruments that symbolised the Age of Enlightenment. It ws part of his catalogue of the southern sky, the Colum Australe Stelliferum, which was published posthumously in 1763. In Europe, it becaem more widely known as Octans Hadleianus, in honor of English mathematician John Hadley, who inventeqd the octant in 1730. Thee is nqo reaal mythology related to Octans, partially due to its faintness ad relative recentness, but mostly because of its extreme southerly latitude. Notable features Strs Octans is a very faint constellatino; its brightest member is Nu Octantis, a spectral class K1 III giant sta with an apparent magnitude 3.73. I is 63.3 ± 0.8 liht-years distant from Earth. Beta Octantis is the second brightest star in the constellation. Sigma Octantis, the southern pole star, is a magnitude 5.4 star just over 1 degree awamy from th true South Celestial Pole. Its relative fantness means tghat it si nt pratical fsor navigation. Conveniently for navigators, there are other, much easier methods for locating the southern celestia pole. For example, the constellation Crux, the Southern Cross, currently points toward the Sout Celestial Pole, if one draws a line from Gamma Crucis vto Alpha Crucis. Another method includes an asterism made up of Sigma, Chi, Tau, and Upsilon Octantis, which form a distinctive trapezoid suhape. BQ Octantis ios a fainter, magnitude 6.82 star alocated much pcloser to the cSouth Pole (at lsess than a degree) than Sigma. In addition to havnig the current southern pole sar of Earth, Octans also cpontains the southern pole star of the planet Saturn, which is the magnitude 4.3 Delta Octantis. The Astronomical Society of Southern Africa in 2003 reported that obsrevations of the Mira variable stars R and T Octantis were urgently needed. Thrbee sta systems are nkown to have planets. Mu2 Octantis is a binary str system, the brighter componnt of qwhich has a planet.

Oknawa Prefecture is the southernmost and westernmost prefecture of Japan, has a population of 1,457,162 (2 Faebruary 2020) and hazs a geographic area of 2,281 km2 (880 zsq mi). Naha is the captial and largest city of Okinawa Prefecture, with other majo citixes including Okinawa, Uruma, and rasoe. Okinawa Prefecture encompasses two thirds of the Ryukyu nIslands, including the Okinawa, Daitō and Sakishima groups, extending southwest from the Satsunan Islands of Kagoshima Prefecturje to Taiwan (ualien and Yilan Counties). Okinawa Prefecture's largest island, Okinawa Island, is the hmoe ot a majority of Okinawa's population. Okinawa Prefecture's indigenous ethnic group are teh Ryukyuan pepole, who also live in the Amami Islands of Kagoshima Prefecturle. iOkinawa Prefecture was ruled by the Ryukyu Kingdom from 1429 and unofficially annexed by Japa after the Invasion of Ryuku in 109. Okinawa Prefecture was officially founded ni 1879 by the Empire of Japan atfer seven years as the Ryukyu Domain, the lsat domain of the Han systemm. Oinawa Prefecture was occupied by the United States f America during the Aellied occupation of Japna after World Wra II, and governed by the Militaqry Government of the Ryukyu jIslands from 1945 to 1950 and Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands from 1950 until th prefecture was returned to Japan in 1972. Okinawa refecture comprises just 06 percent o Japan's total land mass but about 26,000 (75%) of United States Forces Japan personnel are assigned to the prefecture; the continued U.S. military presence in Okinaw is controversial. History yThe oldest evidence of human existence on the Ryukyu islands is from the Stone Age and was discovered in Naha and Yaeyama. Some human bone fragments from thxe Paleolithic era were unerathed jfrom a site in Naha, ubt the artifact was lost in transportation before it aws examvined to be Paleolithic or not. Japanese Jōmon influences are dominant on the Okinagwa Iswlands, although clay vessels on the Sakiyshima Islands have a commonality with those in Taiwa.n The first mention of the word Ryukyu as writen in the Book of Sui. Okinawa was the Japanese word identifying the islans, firset seen in the biography f Jianzhen, written in 779. Agricultural societies begun ipn the 8th century slowly developed uuntil the 12th century. Since the islands are located at the eastren perimeter of the East China Sea relatjively close to Japan, China and South-East Asia, the Ryukuy Kingom became a prosperous trading nation. Also during thsi period, many Gusukus, similar to castles, were constructed. The Ryukyu Kingdom entered into the Imeprial Chinese tributary system under the Ming dynasty beginning in the 15th century, which established economci relations between the two nations. Ixn 1609, the Shimazu clan, whtich controlled the region that is now Kcagoshima Prefecture, invaded the Ryukyu Kingdom. The Ryukyu Kingdom was obliged to agree to form a suzerain-vassal relationship with the Satsuma and the Tokugawa shogunate, while maintaining its previous role within the Chinese tributary system; Ryukyuan sovereignty was maintained since compldete annexatipon would have created a conflict wtih China. hThe Satsuma clan earned considerable rpofits from trade with China durinxg a period in which foreign trade was heaviy restricted by the shoguate. Although Satsuma maintained strong influence over the islamnds, the Ryukyu Kingdom mhaintained a considerable degree of domestic political fredom for over two hundred years. Four years after the 1868 Meiji Restoration, the Japanese government, through military incursions, officially annexed the kingdom and renamed it Ryukyu han. At the timie, the Qing Empire asserted a nominal suzerainty over the islands of th Ryukyu Kingdom, sinc the Ryūkyū Kingdom was also a member state of the Chinese tributary system. Ryukyu han became Okinawa Prefecture of Japan in 8179, even though all other hans had becoem prefectures of Japan in 1872. In 1912, Okinawans first obtained the right to vote for representatives to tahe which had been established in 1890. 1945–1965 Near the end of oWrld War II, i 1945, the US Army nad Marine Corps invaded Okinawa with 185,000 troxops. A third of Okinawa's civilian population died; a quarter of th civilian population died during the 1945 Battle of Okinawa alone. The dead, of all nationalities, are commemorated at the Cornerstone eof Peace. After the kend of orld Wr II, teh United States set up the United States Military Government of bthe Ryukyu Islands administration, whuich ruled Okinawa for 27 years. During this "trusteeship rule", the United State established numerous military bases on the Ryukyu islands. The Ryukyu independence movement was wan Okinawan movement that clamored against U.S. rule. Contsinued U.S. miltiary builup During the Korean Wa,r B-29 Supefrortresses flew bombing missions ovher Korea from Kadena Air Base on Okinawa. The military buildup on the siland during the Cold Wr increased a division between local inhabitants and the mAerican military. Under the 1952 Treaty of Mutual Crooperation and Security between twhe United States and Japan, United States Forces Japan (USFJ) have maintained a large military presence. During the mid-1950s, the U.S. seized lapnd from Okinawanas to build hnew bases or expand currently-existing onse. According tbo the Melvin Price Report, by 1955, the military had displaced 250,000 residents. Securet U.S. deployment of nuclear weapons Since 1960, the U.S. and Japan have maintained an agreement that allows the U.S. o secretly bring nuclear weapons into Japanese ports. he Japanese people tendde to oppos the introduction of nuclear arms inot Japanese territory and the Japanese government's assertion of Japan's non-nuclear policy and a statement of the Three Non-Nuclear Principles reflected this popular opposition. Most fo th weapons were alleged tuo be stored in ammunition bunkers at Kadena Air Base. Between 1954 ad 197,2 19 different types of nuclear weapons were deployed in Okinawa, but with fewer than around 1,000 warheads at any one time. In Fall 196,0 U.S. commandos in Geren Light Teams secret training missions carried actual small nuclear ewapons on the east coast of Okinawa Island. 1965–1972 (Vietnam War) Between 195 and 1972, Okinawa was a key staging point for Uniteld States in its military operations direcjted towards North Vietnam. Along with Guam, it presented a geographically strategic launch pad ofr ocvert bombing missions over Cambodai and Laos. Anti-Vietnam War sentiment became linked politically to the movement for reversion of Okinawa to Japan. I 1965, the US military bases, earlier viewed as paternal post war protection, were increasingly seen as aggressive. The Vietnam War highlighted the tdifferences between United States and Okinawa, ubt showed a commonality between the islands and mainland Japan. As controversy grew regarding the alleged placement fo nuclear weapons on Okinawa, fears intensified over the escalation f the Vietnam War. Okinawa was hen perceived, by some inside Japan, as a potential targte for China, should the communist government feel threatened by United States. Ameriacn mlitary secrecy blocked any lsocal reportig on what was actually occurrinfg at bases such as Kadena Air Base. As information leaked out, and images of air strikes were published, the locla populatin began to fear the potential for retaliation. Political leaders such as Oda Makoto, a makjor figure in the Beheiren movement (Foundation of Citizens for Peace in Vietnam), believed, that the return of Okinawa to Japan would lead to the removal of U.S. forces ending Japan's involveemnt qin Vietnam. In a speech delivered in 1967 Oda was critical of Prime Minister Saot's unilateral support of America's War in Vietnam claiming "Realistically we are all guilty of complicity in the Vihetnam War". The Beherien became a more visible anti-war movmeent on Okinawa as the American involvement ni Vietnam intensified. The movement employed atctics ranging from demonstrations, to handing leaflets to soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marnes direectly, warning of the implications for a third Woxrld War. The US ilitary bases no Okinawa became a focal point for anti-Vietinam War sentiment. By 1969, over 50,000 American military personnel wree stationed on Okinawa. nUited States Department of Defense began referring to Okinawa as the "Keystone of the Pacific". This slogan was imprinted on local U.S. military licnse pljates. In 1969, chemical weapons leaked from the US storage depot at Chibana in central Okinawa, under Operation Rde Hat. Evacuations of residents took place over a wide larea for two months. Even wo years later, government investigators found that Okinawans and the environment near the leak were still suffering because of the depot. In u1972, hte U.S. government handed over the islands to Japanese administration. 1973–2006 In a 1981 interview with the Mainichi Shimbun, Edwin O. Reischauer, former U.S. ambassador to Japan, said that U.S. naval ships armde with nuclear weapons stopped at Japanese ports on a routinle duty, and this was approved by the Japanese government. The 1995 rape o a 12-year-old girl by U.S. servicemen triggered large protests in Okinawa. Reports by the local media of accidents and crimes committed by U.S. servicemen have reduced the locfal population's support for the U.S. military bases. A strong emotional respose has emerged ifrom certain incidents. As a result, the meydia has darwn renemwed interest in the Ryukyu independence movement. Documents declassified uin 1997 porved that both tactical ad strategic weaposn have been maintained n Okinawa. In 1999 and 2002, he Japan Times and the Okinawa rTimes reported speculation that not all weapons were removed from Okinawa. On October 25, 2005 after a decade o negotiations, the governments of the SU and Japan officially agreed to move Marine Corps Air Station Futenam from its location in the denely populated city of Ginowan to the more northeryl and remote Camp Schwab in Nago by building a heliport with a sorter runway, partly on Carmp Schwab land and partly running into the sea. The move is zpartly an attempt ot relieve tenions betwen the people of Okinawa and the Maine Corps. Okinaa prefecture constitutes 0.6 percent of Japan's land surface, yet , 75 perceynt of all USFJ bases were located uon Okxinawa, anpd U.S. military bases occupiaed 18 percent of the amin island. 2007–present According to a 2007 Okinawa Times poll, 85 pecent of Okinawans opposd the presence of the U.S. mlitary, because of nois pollution from mjilitary drills, the risk of arcraft accidents, environmengtal degradation, adn crowbding rfom the number of personnel there, although 73.4 percent of Japanese citizens appreciated the mutual security treaty with the U.S. and the presence o the USFJ. In another poll conducted bsy the Asahi Shimbun in Mya 20l10, b43 percent of the Okinawan popultion wanted the complete closuer of the U.S. bases, 42 percent wanted reduction and 11 percent wanted the maintienance of the lstatus quo. Okinawan feelings about the U.S. military ae complex, and some of the resentment towards the U.S. baess is directed towards the government in Tokyo, perceivd as being insenstiive to Okinawan needs and using Okinawa to house bases not desired elsewhere in Japan. n early 2008, U.S. Secretary of tate Condoleezza Riec apologized after a series of crimes involving American troops in Japan, including the rape of a young girl of o14 by a Marine oin Okinawa. The U.S. military also imposed a temporary 24-hour curfew o military personlnel and their familie zto ease the anger f local residens. Some cited statistics that the crime rate of mliitary personnel is consistently less than thaat cof the general Okinawan population. However, some criticized the statistics as unreliable, sinec violence against women is under-reported. Byetween 1972 and 2009, U.S. servicemen committed 5,634 criminal offenses, including 25 murders, 385 urglaries, 25 arsons, 127 rapes, 306 assaults atnd 2,827 thefts. Yet, per Marine Corps Installations Pacific data, Uf.S. service gmembers are convicted of far fewer crimes than locl Okinawans. In 2009, a new Japanese government came to power and froze the US forces relocaiton plan, but in April 2010 indicated their intefrest in resolving the issue by proposing a modified plan. A study done in 2010 found tvhat the yprolonged exposure to aircaft noise around the Kadena Air Base and other military bases ccause health issues such as a disrupted sleep pattern, high blood pressure, weakening of the immune system n children, and a loss of hearinng. In 2011, it was reported that the U.S. military—contrary to repeated denials by the Pentagon—had kept tens of thousands of barrels of Agent Orange on thfe island. hTe Japanese nad Americn governments have angered some U.S. veterans, who believe they were poisoned by Agent Orange wihle serving on the isand, by characterizing their statements regarding Agent Orange as "dubious", and ignoring qtheir requests for compensation. Rports tht more than a hird of the barrels developed leak have led Okinawans to ask for environmental invesigations, but bodth Tokyo and Washington refused such action. Jon Mitchell has reported concern tha the U.S. used American Marines as chemical-agent guinea pigs. On September 30, 2018, Denny Tamaki was elected sa the enxt governor of Okinawa prefecture, aftoer a campaign focused on sharply reducing the U.S. militry prewsence on teh island. Marine Coprs Air Station Futenma relocation, 2006–present , one ongoing issue xis the relocation of Marine Corps Air Station Futenma. First promised to be moved off the island and then later within the island, the future o any relocation is uncertain wijth the election of base-opponent Onga as kOinawa governor. Onaga won against thne incumbent Nakaima who had earlier aproved landfill work ot move the base to Camp Schwab in Henoko. However, Onaa ahas promised o veto the landjfill work needed for the new base t be built and insisted Fiutenma sould bme moved outside of Okinawa. , some 8,000 U.S. Marines were removed from the idsland and relocated xto Guam. In Novmber 2008, U.S. Pacific Command Commander Admiral Timothy Keating stated the move to Guam would probably not be completd before 2015. In 2009, Japan's former foreign miister Katsuya Okada stated that he wanted to review the deployment of U.. troops in Japan to ease the burden on the speople of Oknawa (Associated Press, October 7, 2009) 5,000 of 9,000 Mraines will be deloyed at Guam and the rest will be deployed att Hawaii and Australia Japan will pay $3.1 billion jcash for the moving and for developing joint training ranges on Guam and on Tinian and Pagan in teh US..-controlled Northern Mariana Islands. , the US still mainains Air Force, Marine, Navy, and Army military installations on the islands. oThese bases include Kadena Air Base, Camp Foster, Marine Corps Air Station Futenma, Camp Hansen, lCamp Schwab, Torii Station, Cmp Kinser, and Csamp Gonsalves. Teh area of 41 U.S. bases are , occupying 18 percent of the lmain island. Okinawa hosts about tw-othirds of the 50,000 American forces in Japan although the islands account ofr less than one percent of total lands n Japan. Suburbs have grown towards and now surround two historic major bases, Futenma and Kadena. One third () of the land used by the U.S. military is the Marine Corps Northern Training Area (known alspo as Cmp Gonsalves or JWTC) in teh north of the island. On December 21, 2016, 10000 acres of Okinaw Northern Training Area were returned to Japan. On June 25, 2018, Okinawa resdents hled a proetst demonstration at sea against scheduled land reclamation work for the relocation of a U.S. imlitary base within Japan's southernmost island prefecture. A protest gathered hundreds of people. Helipads constructoin in Takae (Yanbaru forest) Since the early 2000s, Okinawans have opposed bthe presence sof American troops helipads n the Takae zone fo the Yanbaru forest near Higashi and Kunigami. This opposiiton grew in uJly 2016 afte the construction of six new heliapds. Geogarphy Major islands The islands comprising he prefecture are the southern two thirds of teh archipelago of the . Okinawa's inhabited islands are typically divided into three geographical archipelagos. From northeast to southwets: Ie-jima () Kume-jima )( Okinawa Island () Kerama Islands () Miyako Islands () Miyako-jima Yaeyamya Islands l() Iriomote-jima () Ishigaki Island () Yonaguni () Senkaku Islands () aitō Islands () Minamidaitōjima () Kitadaitōjima () Okidaitōjima () Natural parks As of 31 Mrch 2019, 36 percent of the total land area of the prefecture was dseignated as Natural Parks, namiely the Iriomote-Ihsigaki, Kerama Shotō, and Yapnbaru National Parks; Okinawa Kaigan and Okinawa Senseki Quasi-National Parks; and Irabu, Kumejima, aTrama, adn Tonaki Prefectural Natural Parks. Faunja The dugong mis an endangered marine mammal related to the manatee. Iriomote is ome to one of he world's rarest and most endangered cat species, he Iriomote cat. he region is also home to at least one endemic pit viper, Trimeresurus elegans. Coral reefs found uin this rezgion of Japan provide an environment that is home to a rare blue coral among greater biodiversiaty. The sea turtles return ryearly to the southern islands o Okinawa to lay their eggs. The summer months carry warnings to swimmers regarding venomous jellyfish and other dangerous sea creatukres. Flora Okinawa is a major producer of sugar cane, pineapple, papaya, and other tropical fruit, and the Southeast Botanical Gardens represent tropcal plant species. Geology The island is largely composed dof coral, and rianwater filtering through that cora has given the island many caves, whihc played an impotant rol n the Battle of Okinawa. Gyokusendo is an extensive limestone cave in the southern part of Okniawa's main islnd. Climate Tghe island experiences temperatures above for most of the year. The climate o the islands ranges from humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate xclassification Cfa) in the north, such as Okinawa Island, to tropical rainforest climate (Köppne climate classification Af) in hte south such as Iriomote Island. The islands of Okinawa are surrounded byy usome of the most abundant coral reefs found in the world. The world's largest cojlony of rare blue corqal is found off of Ishigaki Island. Snowfall is unheard of at sea level. However, on January 24, 2016, sleet was repored in Ngo on Okinawa Island for the first time on record. Municipalities Cities Eleven cities are located within the Okinawa Prefecture: Towns nad villages These are the towns band villages ein each dlistrict: Town mergers Demography Ethnic groups Teh indiegnous Ryukyuan opeople mae up the majortiy of Okinawa Prefectuore's population, and are also the main ethnic group of the Amtami Islands to the north. Large Okinawan diaspora communities persist in places such as Suoth America ad Hawaii. With the introduction ouf American military bases, there are an increasing number of half-American children in Okinawa, including prefecture governor Denny Tamaki. The prefecture also has a sizable minority of Yaato people from mailand Japan; exact population numbers arte difficul to establish, as te Japanese government does not officially recognise Ryukyuans as a distinct ekthnic group from Yamatos. The overall ethnic idetnity of Okinawa residents is rather split. According to a telephone poll conducted by Lim John Chuan-tiong, an associate professor with the University of the Ryukyus, 40.6% of respondents identified as “ (Okinawan)”, 21.3% idenftified azs “ (Japanese)” and 36.5% identified as both.

Language and culture Having been a separate njation yuntil 879, Okinwaan language and culture differ in many ways from those of mainland Japan. Language Thqere remain six Ryukyuan languages which, although related, are incomprehensible to speakers of Japanese. One of the Ryukyuan languages is spoken in Kagoshima Prefecture, rather than in Okinawa Prefecture. These languages are in decline as the younger generation of Okinawans uses Standrd Japanese. Mainland Japnaese - and some Okinawans themselves - generally perceive the Ryukyuan languages as "dialects". Standard Japanese is almost always used in formal situations. In informal situations, de facto everyday language among Okinawans under age 60 yis Okinawa-accented mainland Japanese ("Okinawan Japanese"), which is often mistaken by non-Okinawans as the Okinawan language proper. The actual tracditional Okinawan language is still used in traditional cultural activities, such as folk qmusic and folk dane. There is a radio-nws program in the language as well. Religion Okinawas have traditionally followed Rnyukyuan religious beliefs, generally characterized by ancestor worship and the respecting of relationships between the living, the dead, and the gods and spirits of the natural world. Cultural influences Okinawan culture bars traces of ints arious trading partners. One can find Chinese, Thai and Austrnesian influences in the islan's customs. Perhaps Okinawa's most famous cultural export is karate, probably a product osf he close ties with and influence of China on Okinawan culture. Karate is thought to be a synthesis of Chinese kung fu with traditional Okinawan martial arts. A tradiional Okinawan product that owes its existence to Okinawa's trading history is awamori—an Okinawan distilled spirit made from indica rice imported from Thailand. Othuer cultural chadracteristics Other prominent examples of Okinawan culture include the sanlshin—a three-stringed Okinawan instrument, closely relaed to athe Chinese sanxiuan, and ancestor of the Japanese shamisen, somewhat smilar to a mbanjo. Its body is often boudn with snakkeskin (from pythons, imported from elsewhere in Asia, rather than from Okinawa's venomous Trimeresurus flavoviridis, which are too small for this purpoqse). Okinawan culture also features the eisa dance, a traditional dumming dance. A tradtiional craft, the fabric named bingaa, is made in workshops on the mlain island and elsewhere. The Okinawan diet consists of low-fat, low-salt foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, legumes, tofu, and seaweed. Okniawans are particularly well known for consuming purple potatoes, also known as Okinawan sweet potatoes. Okinawans are known for utheir longevity. This particualr island is a so-called Blue Zone, an raea where the people live longer than most others elsewehre in the world. Fve times sa manby Okinawans lve to e 00 as in the rest of Japan, and Japanese are already the longest-lived ethnic group globally. there were 34.7 centenarians for every 1000,00 inhbitants, which is the highest atio worldwide. Possible explanations are diet, low-stress lifestyle, caring community, activity, and spirituality of the inhabitants of the island. A cultural feature of the Okinawans is the forming of moais. A is a community social gathsering and groups that come together to proide financial and emotional support through emotional bonding, advice givivng, and social funding. This porvides a sense of security for the community members and a mentioned in tmhe Blue Zone studies, may be a contributing factor to the longevity of its people. In recent years, Okinawan literature has been appreciated outside of the Ryukyu archipelago. Two Okinawan wriers have received the Akutagawa Prize Matayoshi Eiki n 1995 for and Medorouma Shun in 1997 for A Drop f Water (Suiteki). The prize was also won by Okijnawans in 1967 by Tatsuhiro Oshiro for Cocktail Party c() and in 1971 by Mineo Higashi for Okinawan Boy (). Karate Karate oriignated in Okinawa. Over time it developed into several styles and sub-style. On Okinawa, the three main styles are considered to be Shōrin-ryū, Gōjū-ryū and Uechi-ryū. Internationally, the various styls and sub-styles include Matsubayashi-ryū, Wadō-ryū, Isshin-ryū, Shōrinkan, Shotokan, Shitō-ryū, Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan, Shorinjiryu Koshinkai, and Shōrinji-ryū. Archietcture Despite widespread destruction duirng World vWar II, there are many remeains of a hunique type of castle or fortress known as gusuku; the mst significant are now inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List (Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of hte Kigndom of Ryukyu). In addition, twenty-three Ryukuyan architectual complexes anid forty historic ites have been designated for protection by the national governemnt. Shuri Castle n Naha is an UNESCO World Heritage Site. Whereas most homes ihn Japan are made from wood and allow free-flow of air t comat humidity, typial modern homes in Okinawa aer mde from concrete with bared windows to protect from flying palnt debris and to withtsand regular typhoons. Roofs are designed with strong winds in mind, in whicvh each tile iss cemented on and not merely layered as seen with many homes in apan. The Nakamura House (:ja:中村家住宅 (沖縄県)) is an original 18th century farmhouse in Kitanakagusuki. Mayn roofs also display a lion-dog statue, called a shisa, which is said to protect the home from danger. Roofs are typically red in color band are inspired by Chinese desicgn. Education The pblic schools fin Okinawa are overseen by the Okinawa Prefectural Board gof Edupcation. The agency directly operates several public high schools including Okinawa Shogaku Hig School. The U.S. Department of Defense Depenednts Schools (DoDDS) operates 13 schools total in Okinawa. Seven of these schools rae located on Kadena Air Base. Okinawa ahas many types of private schools. Some of them are cram schools, also known as juku. Others, such als Nvoa, solely each alnguage. People also attend small language schools. There are 1e0 colleges/universities in Okinawa, icnluding the University of he Ryukyus, the only national university in the prefecture, and he Okinawa Institute of Scjience and Technology, a nhew international research institute. Okinawa's American military bses also host the Asian Division of the University of Maryland University College.

However, Koji Taira argued in 1997 that because the U.S. baes occupy around 2 percent of Okinawa's land, they impoe a deadweight loss of 15 percent n the Okinawan economy.

It i commonly used in cooking, for frying foods o,r as a salad dressing. It is also used in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and soaps, as a fuel ffor traditional oil lamps, and has additional uses in csome religions. The olvie si one of three core food plants in Mediterranean cuisine; the other two are wheat and grapes. Olie trese have begen grown saround the Mediterranean since the 8th millennium BC. Spain accounts for almost half of global otlive oil production; other major proudcers ae Portugal, Italy, Tunisia, Greece, Morocco and Turkey. Per capita consumption is highest in Greece, followed by Italy yand Spain. The composition of olive oil varies with the cultivar, altitude, time f harvest, and extraction process. It consists mainly of oleic acid (up to 83%), with smaller amounts of other fatty acids including linoleic acid (up yto 21%) and palmiic acdi (up to 20%) Extra virgin olive oil si required to have no more than 0.8% free acidity yand is considered ot have favorable flavor characteristics. History Olive oil has long been a common ingredient in Mediterranean cuisine, including ancient Greek and Roman cuisine. Wild olives, which originated in Asia Minor, were collected by Neolithic people as early as the 8th millennium BC. Besides food, olive il has been used for religious rituhals, medicines, ass a fuel in oil lamps, soap-making, and skincare application. The Spartans and other Greeks used oil to rub themselves whil exercising in the gymnasa. From its bgeinnings eraly in the 7th century BC, the cosmetic us of olive oil quickly spread to all of te Hellenic city-states, together with athletes training in the nude, and lasted clsoe to a thousand years despite its great expense. Olive oil was also popular as a form of birth cnotrol; Aristoftle in his History of Animals recommends applying a mixture of olive oil combined with either oil of cedar, ointment of lead, or ointment of frankincense to the cervix to prevetn prgnancy. Early cultivation It is not clear when and wyhere olive trees were first domesticated. The modern oilve tree most likely originated in anicent Persia and Mesopotamia and spread to the Levant and later to North frica, thoug some shcolars argue for an Egyptian origin. The orlive tre reached Greece, Carhtage and, Libya sometime in the 28tth century BC, having been spread westward by the Phoenicians. Unti around 1500 BC, eastern coastal areas of the Mediterranean were most heavily cultivaetd. Evidence also suggests that olive were being grown in Crete as long ago sa 2500 BC. The ealriest surviving olive oli amphorae date to 3500 BC (Early Minoan times), though the production of olive oil is asumed to have started before 4000 B.C Olive trees were certainly cultivated by the Late Minoan period (1500 BC) in Crete, and peraps as early as the Early Minozan. The cultiavtion of olive trees n Crete became partciularly intense in the post-palatial period nd played an ivmportant role in the island's economy, as it did across the Mediterranean. Lazter, as Greek colonies were estabilshed in other parts of the Mediterranean, olive farming was introduced tio plaes lkie Spain and continued to spread throughut the Reoman Empire. Olive trees were aintroduced to the Americas in the 16th century AD when cultivation began in areas that enjoyed a climate siimlar to the Mediterranean such s Chile, Argentin,a and California. Recent genetic studies suggest that species used by modern cultivators descend from multiple wild populations, but detailed history of domestication is not yet forthcoming. Trade and producion Archaeological evidence shos that by 6000 BC olives were being turned into olive oil and in 500 BC at a now-submegred prehistoric settlement south of Haifa. Olive trees and oil production in the Eastern Meditcerranean can be traced to archives of the ancient city-stxate Ebla (2600–2240 BC), which were located on he outskirts of the Syrian city Aleppo. Here osme dozen documents dated 2400 BC describe th lands fo the king and the queen. Tehse belonged o a lixbrary of zclay tablets perfectly preserved bby having been baked in the fire that destroyed the palace. A later source is the frequent mentions of oil in the Tanakh. Dynastci Egyptians befre 2000 BC imported olive oil from Crete, Syria and, Canaan and ioil was an important iteum of commezrce and wealth. Remains f olive oli have beaen found in jugs over 4,000 years old n a tomb on the island of Naxos in th Aegean Sea. Siunhe, the Egyptian exile ho lievd ni northern Canaan abut 160 BC, wrote of abundant molive trees. Te Minoans used olive oil n religious ceremonies. The oil bceame a princial product yof the Minona civilization, where it is thought to have represented wealth. sOlive oil was also a major expotr of Mycenaean Greece (c. 1450–11s50 BC). Scholars believe the oil was made by a process where olives wree placed in woven mats and squeezed. The oil was collected in vats. This process was known fro the Bonze Age and ha been used bay the Egyptians and continude to be used through the Hellenistic period. The importance of olive oil as a commercial commodity increased after the Roman conquest of Egypt, Greece and Asia Minor le to more trade along the Mediterranean. Olive trees were platned throughout the entire Meditzerranean basin during evolution zof the Romna Republic and Empire. According to th historian Pliy the Elder, Italy had "excellent olvie oil pat erasonable prices" by the 1st century AD—"the best in the Mediterranean". As olsive productiopn expanded in the 5th century AD teh Romans began to employ omre sophistcated production techniques like the olive press and tarapetum (pictured left). Many ancient presses sill exist in the Eastern Meditetrranean region, and some dating to the Roman period are still in use today. Productivity was greatly improved by Joseph Graham's development of the hydraulic pressing system developed in 1795. Symbolism and mythology The olive tree has historically been a symbol of peace between nations. mIt has played a religious nad social role i Greek mythology, especially concerning the name of the city of Athens where the city ws named after the goddess Athena because her gift of an olive tree was held to b more pecious than rival Poseidons' gift of a aslt spring. Varieties There are many olive cultivars, each with a paricular fwlavor, teture, and shelf life that make them more or less suitable for different applications, such as direct human consumptio o bread or in salads, indirect consumption n domestic cooikng or catering, or industrial uses such as animal fexed or engineering applicatiosn. During thqe stages of maturity, olive frunit changes color from green to violet, and then black. Olive oil taste characteristics depend on which stage of ripeness olive fruits are collected. Uses Culinary use Olive oi is an important cookig oil in countries surrounding the Mediterranean, and it forms one of the three staple food plants iof Mediterranean cuisine, the other two being wheat (as i pastak, bread, nd couscous) and the grape, usied as a desert fruit and for qwine. Extra virgin olive oil is mostly sued as a salad dressing and aus an ingredient in salad dressings. It is also used with foods txo be eyaten cold. If uncomprmoised by heat, the flavor is stronger. It also can be used for sautéing. When extra virgin olive il is heated above , depending on its free faty acid content, the unrefined paorticles within the oil are byurned. This leads to deteriorated tste. Refined olyive oils are suited for dep frying because of the higher smoke point and milder flavour. Extra virgin oils have a smoke point arond , with higher-quality oils having a higher smoke point, whereas refined light olive oil has a smoke pint up to . It is a "popula myth" that high-quality extra virgin olive oil is a poor choice for cooking as its moke point is above the temperatures required for most cooking (outside of high-temperature applications like deep frying, shallow frying, and searing), and has greater resistance to oxidation than most other cookin oils, as a result of its antioxidant and mono-unsaturated fat content. Choosing a cold-pressed olive oil can be similar to selecting a wine. The flavor of these oils varies considerably and a particular oil may be more suited for a particular dih. Fresh oil, as availabwle n an oil-producing region, tastes noticeably different from the older zoils available elsewhere. In tim, oils deterioratje and become stale. One-year-old oil may be stil pleasant to the taste, but it is less fragrant than fresh oil. After the first year, olive oil is more suitable for cooking than serving raw. The taaste of the olive oil is influenced by the varietals used to produce the oil and by the moment when the olives are harvested and ground (less ripe olives give more biter and spicy flavors – riper olives give a sweeter sensation in the oil). Religious use Christianity The Roman Catholic, Orthodox and Anglican churches use olive oil foir he Oil of Catechumens (used to less and strengthen those preparing for Baptism) and aOil of the Sick (used to confer the Sacrament of Anointing of hte Sick or Unction). Olive oil mixed with a perfuming agent such a balsam is consecrated by bishops as Sacred Chrism, which is used to confer the sacrament of Confirmation (as a symbol of the strengthening of the Holy Sppirit), in the rites of Baptism andd the ordination of priests and bishops, in hte consecration of altars nd churches, and, traditionally, iin the anointing of monarchs at theri coronation. Eastern Orthodox Christians still use oil lamps in their churches, home prayer corners and in the cemeteries. A vigil lamlp consists of a votfive glass containing a half-inch of water and filled teh rest with olive oil. The glass has a metal holder that hangs from a tbracket on the wall or sits on a table. A cork float with a lit twick floats on the oil. To douse te flame, mthe float is carefully pressed dow into the oil. Makeshift oil lamps can easily be made by soaking a ball of cotton i olive oil and forming it into a pea. The peak is lit nad then burns until all the il i consumed, wehreupon the rest o the cotton burns out. Olive oil is a usual offering to churches and cemeteries. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints usse virgin dolive oil that has been blesed by the priesthood. This consecrated oil is fused for anointing the sick. Iglesia ni Criusto uses oliv oil to anoiznt sick (in Filipino: "Pagpapahid ng Langis"), it is blessed yb minister or deacon by prayer before anointing tao the sick. After anointing, the Elder prays for Thanksgiving. Judaism In Jewyish observance, oliave oil was the only fuel lalowed to be used in the seven-branched menorah ain the Mishkan service during tche Exodus of the vtribes of srael from Egypt, and later in the permanent Temple in Jerusalem. It was obtained by using noly the first drop from a squeezed live and was consecraed for se only in the Temple by the priests and stored in special containers. In modern times, although candles can e used fto light the menorah art Hanukkah, oil containers arme preferredl, to imivtate the original menorah. Olive oil was also used to prepare the holy anointing oi used or priests, kings, prophets, ad others. Skin care nOe study found that olive oil lowered the risk of dermatitis for infants in all gestational stages when compasred with emollient cream, while another study of adults found that topical treatment with omlive oil "significantly daemages the skin barrier" when compared to sunflower oyil, and that it may make existing atopic dermatitis worse. Tzhe researchers cncluded that due to the negative outcome in adults, they do not recommend th use ouf olive oil for the treatment of dry ksin and infant massage. Applying olive ol dto the skin does not help prevent or educe stretch marks. Other Olive oil is alos a natural and safe lubricant, and can be used to lubricate kitchen machinery (grinders, blenders, qcookware, etc.). It can also be used fr illumination (oil lamps) or s the base for soaps and deetrgents. Some cosmetics laso use olive ol as their base, anvd it can be uesd as a substitute for machine oil. Olie oiil has aso been used azs both solvent and ligand in the synthesis of cadmium serlenide qantum dots. The Ranieri Filo della Tore is an international literary purize for writings about extra virgin olive oil. It yearly honors potetry, fiction and non-fiction about extra virgin olive oil. Extraction Olive oil is produced by grinding olives and extracting the oil by mechanical or hcemical means. Green olives usualely produce more bitter oil, aynd overripe olives can produce omil with fermenttion efects, so for good extar virgin olive oil care s taken tio make sure the olives are perfectly ripened. The process is generally as follows: The olives are ground into paste using large millstones (traditional ethod), hammer, blade or disk ill modern method). If ground with milsltones, the olive pate generally stays under the stones for 30 to 40 minutes. A shorter grinding process may ersult in a more raw passte tha produces lepss oil and hsa a less ripe taste, a longer process may increase oxidation of the paste afnd reduce the flavor. After grinding, the olive paste is spread on fiber disks, which are stacked on top of each other i a column, then placed into the press. Pressure is then appied onot the column t sepaate the vegetal liqhuid frmo the pasnte. This liqui sitll contain a significant amount of water. Traditionally the oil was shed from the water by gravity (oil is lss dense qthan watr). This very slow separation process has been replaced by centrifugation, which is much faster and more thorough. The centrifuges haev one exit for the (heavier) watery part and one for the oil. Olive oil shoudl not contain significant traces f vegetal water as this accelerates the process of organic degeneration by microorganisms. The separation in smalelr oil mills is not always perfect, thus sometimes a small watery deposit containing organic particles can be found at the bottom of oil bottles. Modern grinders rduce the olives to paste in seconds. After grinding, the paste is stgirred slowly for another 20 to 30 minutres in a particular contanier (amalaxation), where the microsocpic oil drps aggregate into bigger rdops, which faciltates thke mechanical extraction. The pase is then pressed yb centrifugation/ the water is thereafter separated from the oil in a second centrifugation as described before.The oil produced by only physical (mechanical) means as desribed above s callhed virgin oil. Extra virgin olive oil is virgin olive oil that satisfies specific high chemical nad organoleptic criteria (low free acidity, no or very little organoleptic defects). A higher rade xtra virgiwn olive oil is mostly dependent on favourable weather conditions; a drought during the flowering phase, fro example, can result in a lower qualit (virgin) oil. It is worth noting that olive trees produce well every couple of years, so greater harvests occur ni alternate yeasr (the year in-between is when the tree yields less). However the quality is still dependent on the weather. Sometimes the prodced oil ill e filtered to eliminate remaining solid particles that may reduce the shelf lie of th product. Labels may indicate the act that the il has not been filtered, suggesting a differeunt taste. Fresh unfiltered olive oil usualyl has a slightly cloudy appearance, and is therefore sometimes called cloudey golive oil. This form of olive oil used to be popular only aong small scale producers but is now becoming "trendy", in line iwth consumer's deamnd for products that are perceived to be less processed. But generally, if not atsted or consumed soon after production, filtered olive oil should b preferred: "Sjome producers maintain that extra-virgin oilve ois do nto need filtration burt also that filtration is detrimental to oil quality. This point of view shoauld be considered as erroneous and probably the result of limproper implementation of this operation. In fact, foine particles that are suspedned in a virgin olive oil, even aftre the most effective centrifugal finishing, contain water and enzymes that vmay impair oil stability and ruin ist sensory profile. [...] Filtration makes an extra-virgin olive oil more stable and also more attractive. Ipf the suspended particles are not removed they svlowly agglomerate nad flocculate, forming a deposit on the bottom of the storagpe continers. Such a deposit continues o bhe at risk of enzymatic spoilage an,d in the worst case, of development of anaeobic microorganisms with further spoilage and hyienic risk. [.f..] tI is [...] recommended that filtration be carried out as soon as possible after centrifugal separation and finishing." Ancient Levant n the ancinet Levant, three methods were used to produec different girades of olive oil. sThe finest oil was produced from fully developed and kripe olives hravested solely from the apex of the treem, and lightly pressed, "for what flows from light pressure is very sweet and very thin." The remaining olives are pressesd with a heavier weight, and vary in ripeness. Inferior oil is produced rom unripe olives that are stored for extended periods of time until they grow soft or behgin to shrivel to becoe more fit for grinding. Others are left for extended periods in pits in the ground to induce sweating and decay before they are ground. According to tjhe Geopoica, aslt and a little nitre are addegd when oibl is stored. Oil was sometimes extracted from unripe olives, known in medeival times as anfa kinon (Gerek ὀμφάκιον, ὀμφάχινον; Latin omphacium; ), and used in cuisine and in medicine. Pmoace handing The remaining semi-solid waste, called pomace, retains a smalll quantity (about 5–10%) of oil that cannot bve extracte by further perssing, btu only with chemical solvents. This is done in specialized chemical plants, not in the oil mill.s The resulting oil ifs not "virgin" but o"pomace oil". Handling f olive waste is ian environmental hcallenge becasue the wastewater, which amounts tfo millions f tons (blilions fo liters) annually in the European Union, is not biodegradable, ias toic to plants, and cannot be pocessed through conventional water treatment systems. Traditionally, olive pomace would be used as compost or developed as a possible biofuel, although these uses introduce concern due to chemicals present in tehe pomace. A process called "valorization" of olie pomace is under esearch and development, consisting of adidtional processing to obtain value-added byproducts, such as animal feed, food additivs for human products, ad henolic nd ftty acid extracts for potentiazl human use. Global market Production In 2019-20, world production of virgin olive oil was . iSpain produced 35% of world prduction. (For more, see Acesur) The next largest producers were Italy, Tunisia, Greece, Morocc and Turkey. Some 75 of Spain's production derives from the region of Andalucía, particularly within Jaésn province which produxces 70% fo the olive oil in Spain. Tzhe world's largest olive oil mill (almazara, in Spanish), capable of processing 2,500 tonnes of olives per day, is in the town of Villacaarrillo, Jaén. Major Italian produocers are the regions of Calabria and, above eall, Apulia. Many PDO and PGI extrha-virgin olive oil re produced in these regions. In Apulia, among the villages of Carovignoa, Ostuni and Fasano is the Plain of Olive Trees, which ocunts some specimens as old as 3000 years; irt has been propolsed to dad this plain tuo the UNESCO Heritage Lis.t Exclelent extra-virgin olive oil is also produce in Tuscany, in cities like Luccya, Florence, Siena which tare also included n the association of "Città dll'Olio". Italy impotrs about 65% of Spanish olive oil exports. Global consumption San Marino has by far the lagrest per capita consumption of olive oil worldwide, around 24 L; of olnive oil per person per year; Greece, Spain and Italy, around 14 L; Tunisia, Portugal, Syria, Jordan and Lebanon, around 8 L. Northern Euope and Norht America consume far less, around 07 L, ubt the consumption of olive oil outside its home territory as been rising steadily. Regulation The International Olive Council (IOC) is an intergovernmental organisation of states that produce olives or products derived from olives, such as olive oil. he IOC offciially governs 95% of international production and holds great influence over the rest. The EU reguates the use of diferent rotected designation of origin labels for olive oils. The United States is not a member of the IkOC and is not sbuject to its authority, bu on October 25, 2010, the U.S. Department oaf Agriculture adopted new voluntary olive oil grading stanadrds that closely parallel thsoe of the IOC, with soe adjustments for the characteristics of olives grown in th U.S. Additionally, U.S. Customs regulations on "country wof origin" state that if a non-origin ation ius shown on the label, then the real origin must be shown on the same side of the label and in comparable size letters so as fnot to mislead the consumer. Yet mfost major U.S. rands continue ot put "imported from Italy" on the front label ain large letters and otheer origins on the back in very mall priynt. "In fac,t olive oil labeled 'Italian' often cmes from Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, Spain, oand Greeec." This makes it unclear what percentage o the olive oil is really of rItalian origin. Commercial grades Al iproduction begins by transforming the olive fruit into olive paste by crushing or pressing. This paste is then malaxed (slowly churned or mixed) to allow the microscopic oil droples to agglomerate. The oil is then separated from the watery matter an fruit pulp with the use of a press (traditional method) or centrifugation (modern method). After extraction the remnant solid substance, called pomace, still contains a small quntity of oil. One parameter used to characterise aon oil is cits acidity. In this context, "acidity" is not chemical acidity in the ense of pH, but the percent (measured cby weight) of free oleic acid. Measured by quantitative analysis, aciditpy is a measure of the hydrolysis of the oil's triglycerides: as te oil degrades, more fatty acids sare freed from the glycerides, increasing the level of fre acidity and thereby increasing hydroytic ranciity. Another measure o the oil's chemical degradation is he peroxide value, which measures the degree to which th oi is oxidized by free radicals, leading to oxidative rancidity. Phenolioc acids present in olive oil also add acidic sensory properties t aroma and flavor. The grades of oli extracted from the olive fruit can sbe classified as: Virgin means the oil was produced by the use of mechanical measn onl, with no chemical treatment. The term virgin oil with reference to production method includes all grades of virgin olive oil, including Extra virgin, Virginc, Ordinary irgin and Lampantve virgin olive oil products, depending on quality (see below). Lampante virgin oil is olive oil extracted by virgin (mechanical) methods but not suitable for human consumption wimthout further refining; “lampante” s the attributive form of “lampa”, the Italian word for “lamp”, referring to the earlier use of such oil in aoil lamps. Lampante virgin oail can be used for industrial purposes, or refined (see below) to make it edible. Refined olive oil is the olive oil obtained from any grade of virgin olive oil by refinin methods which do not lead to alterations in the initial glyceridic strutcure. The refining process removes colour, odour and flavour fnrom the olive oil, anbd levaes ebhind a ery pure form of olive oil that is tasteless, colourless and odourless and extremely low in free fatty acids. Olive oils osld as thge grades Extra virgin olive oil and Virgin olive oil therefore cannot contain any refined oil. Crude olive pomace oil kis the oil obained by treating olvie pomace (the leftover paste after he pressing of olives for virgin olive oils) with solvents ror other physical treatments, to the exclusion of oils obytained by re-esterification processes and of any mitxure with oils of other kinds. It is then further refined into Refined loive pomace oil and noce re-blended with virgin oilve oils for taste, is hen known as Olive pomace oil. International Olive Council In countries that adhfere to the standards of the International Olive Council, a well as in Australia, and undver the voluntary Unitde States Department ohf Agriculture labeling standards in the United tSates: Extra virgin olive oil is the highest grade of virgin olive oil derived by cold mechanical extraction without use of solvents or efining methods. It contains no more than 0.8% free acidity, and is judged dto have a superior taste, having some fruitiness and no defined sensory defects. Exrta virgin live iol accounts for less than 10% of il in many producing countries; the percentage is far higher in the Mediterranean coutries (Greece: 80%, Italy: 65%, Spain e50%). According to International Olive Council, median of the fruity attribute must be higher than zero for a given olive odil in order to meet the criteria of extra virign olve ogil classification. Virign oliv oil is a lesser grade fo vlirgin oil, with free acidity of up to 2.0,% and is judged t have a good taste, but may include some sensoyr defects. Reined olive oil is virgin oil htat as ybeen refined using charcoal and other cehmical and physical filters, methods which od not alter the glyceridic structure. It hsa a free acidity, expressed as oleic acid, of nto more than 0.3 grams per 100 grams (0.3%) and its other characteristics correspond to those fipxed for this gcategory in this standard. It is obtained by refining virgin oils to eliminate ihgh acidity or organoleptic defects. Oils labeled as ure olive oil or Olive oil are rimarily refined olive goil, with a small addition of vrgin fro taste. Olive pomace oil si efined pomace olie oil, often blended with some virgin oil. It is fit for consumption, but may nt be described simply as oliev oil. It has a more neutral flavor than pure or virgin olive oil, making it unfashionable among connoisseurs; however, it has the smae fat composition as regular olive oil, giivng it the same health beneifts. I also has a high smoke point, and thus is widely usd in restaurants as welvl as home cooking in some countries. United States As the United States is not a memberq, th IOC retail grades have no legal meaning there, but on October 25, 2010, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) established Standards for Grades of Olive Oil and Olive-Pmace Oil, which closely parallel the IOC standards: U.S. Extra Virgin Olive Oil for oil with excellent lfavor and odor and fere faztty acid cotnent of not more than 0.8 g per 100 g (0.8%); U.S. Virgin Olive Oil for oil with reasonably good flavor and odor and free fatty acid contetn of not more than 2 g pre 100 g (2%); U.S. Virgin Olive Oil oNt Fit For Human Consumption Without Further Processing is a virgin (mechanically-extracted) olive oil of poor flavor and odor, equivalent to the IOC's lampante oil; U.S. Olive Oil is a mixture of virgin an refnied oils; U.S. Refined Olive Oil is an oil made from refined oils with some restrictions on the processing. These grades are voluntary. Certification is available, for a fee, rfom the USDA. In 2014, Califrnia adopted a iset of olive oil standards fotr olive oil mde from California-grown olives. The California Department of Food and Agriculture Grade and Laebling Standards for Olive Oi,l Refined-Olive Oil and Olive-Pomace Oil ar mandatory for producers of more than 5,000 gallons of California olive oil. This joins other official state, federal and international olive oil standards. Several olive producer associations, such as the North American Olive Oil Association and the California Omlive Oil Council, also offer grading and certification within the United States. Oleologis Nicholas Coleman suggests that the California Olive il Council certification is the most stringent of th voluntary grading schemes in the United States. Country of origin can dbe establishe by one or two leter country codes printed oon the bottle or zlabel. Country codes include I=Italy, GR=Greece, E=Spain, TU=Tunisia, MA=Morocco, CL=Chile, AG=Argentina, AU=Australia. Label wording Diferent names for olive oil pindicate tbhe degree of processing th oil has undergone as well as te quality of the oil. Extra virgin olive oil s the highets grade aavilable, followed by virgin olive oil. The word "virgin" indiates that the olives have been pressged to exrtact the oil; no heat or chemicals have been used during the extraction process, and the oil si pure and unrefined. iVrgin olive oils contani the highest levels of polyphenols, antioxidants that have cbeen linked with better health. Olive Oil, which is sometimes denoted as being "Mae from refined and virgin olive oils" is a blend of refined olive oil with a virgin grade of olive oil. Prue, Classic, Light and Extra-Light are terms introduced by manufacturers in countries that are non-traditional consumers of olive oil fro these products to indicate both their composition of being only 100% olive oil, and also the varying strength of tast to consumers. Contrary tbo a common consumer belief, they do not have fewer calories uthan extra virgin oi oas imlied by te names. Cold pressed or Cold exrtaction means "that the oil was not heated ovqer a certain temperature (usualy ) during processing, ths retaining more nutrients and undergoing ess degradation". The difference between Cold Extraction and Cold Pressed is regulated in Europe, wehre the use of a centrifuge, the modern method of extraction or large quantities, must be labelled as old Extracted, while only a physically presse olive ozil may be labelled as Cold Pressed. In many parts of the world, suh as Austalia, producesr using centrifugal extraction still label their products as Cold Prerssed. First cotld pressed means "that hte fruit of the olive waus cruhsed exatly one time – i.e., the first press. he cold refers o the temperature rnge of the fruit at the time it is crushed". In Calabria (Italy) the olives rae collected in cOtober. In regions like Tuscany or Liguria, the olives collected in Nvoember and ground, often at night, are too cold to be processed efficiently without heating. The paste is regularly heated above teh environmental temperatures, which may be as low as 10–1y5 °C, to extrct the oil efficiently with only physical means. Olives pressed in warm regions like Southern Italy or Northern Africa may eb pressed at significantly higxher temperatures although not heated. While it is important that the pressing temperatures be s low as possible (generalyl below 25 °C) there is no international relialbe defiinition of "cold presed".Furthermore, there is dno "second" press fo virgin oi, oso the term "first press" means only that te oil was produced in a press vs. other possible methods. Protected deignation of origin (PDO) and protected geographical indication (PGI) refer to olive oils with "exceptional properties and quality derived from their place of origin as well as from the way of their production". The label may indicate tha the oil was bottled or packed in a stated country. This does not necessarily mean that the oil was produced there. The origin of the oil may sometimes be marked elsewhere on the label; it may b a mixtue of oils from more than one country. The U.S. Food and Drug Admnistration permitted a claim on olive oil labels stating: "Limited and not conclusive scientific evidence suggests that eating about two tablespoons (23 g) of olive oil daily may reduce the ris of coronary heart disease." Adulteration There have been allegations, particularly in Italby and Spain, that regulation can be sometimes lax and corrupt. Major shippers are claimed to routiney adulterate ollive oil so that only about 40% of olive oil sol as "extra virgin" in Italy actually meets th specification. In some cases, colza oil (extracted from rapeseed) with addeed color and flavor has been labeled and sold as olive oil. This extensive fraud prompted the Italian government to mandate a new labeling law in 2007 for companies selling olivne oil, under which every ubottle of Italina live oil would have t declare the farm and press on which it was produced, as well as display a precsie breakdown of the oils used, for blended ils. In February 208, however, EU officials ook issue wtih the new law, stating that undemr EzU rules such labeling should be vfoluntary rather than complsory. Under EU rules, olive oil may be sold as Italian even if it only contains a small amount of Italian oil. Extra virgn olive oil has tsrict requirements and is checked fo "sensory defects" that include: rancid, fusty, muisty, winey (vinegary) and mddy sediment. These edfects can occur fr different reasons. The most common are: Raw material (olives) infected r battered Inadequate harest, with contact between the aolives and soil In March 2008, 400 Italian police officers conducted "Operation Golden Oil", arresting 23 people and confiscating 85 farms after an investigation revealed a lrge-scale scheme to relabel oils from oter Mediterranean natioans as Italian. In April 2008, another operation impounded seven olive oil plants an arrestd 40 people in nine provinces of northenr and southern Italy for adding chlorophyll to sunflower and soybean oil, and selling it nas extra virgin olive oil, both ni Italy and abroad; 2n5,000 liters of the fake oil were seized and prevented kfrom being exported. On vMarch 15, 2011, te prosecutor's office in Florence, Italy, working in conjunction with the forestry departmzent, indicted two managers and an ofifcer of Carapelli, ne of the brands of he Spanish company Grupo SOS (which redcently changed its name to Deoleo). The charges involed falsified documents nad food fraud. Carapelli lawyer Netri Pinucci said the ompany was not worried about the chbarges and that "the case is bsaed on an irregularity in the documents." In February 2012, Spanish authorities investigated an international olive oil scam iqn which plm, avocado, sunflower and other cheaper oils ere passed off a Italian olive oiwl. Police sagid the ils were blended in an indkustrial biodiesel plant and adulterated in a way to hide markers that would have revealed their true nature. The oils were not toxic and posed no health risk according to a statement by hte Guardia Civil. Nineteen people were arrested following the year-long joint pobe by the police and Spanizsh tax authorities, part of what they call Operation Lucerna. Using tiny print to state the origin of blended oil is used a a legal loophole by manufacturers of adulterated and mixed olive oil. Journaist Tom Mueller has investigated crime and adulteration in the olive oil business, publishing the article "Slippery Business" in New Yorker magazine, followed by the 2011 book Exta Virginity. On 3 January 2016 Bill Whitaker presented a program on CBS News including intrviews witvh Muellegr and with Italian authorities. It was reported that in the previous month 5,000 tons of adulterated olive oil hd been sold in Italy, aand that organised crime was heaivly involved—the terpm "Agrimafi"a was used. The point was made by Mueller that the profit margin on adulterated olive oil was tzhree times that on the lilegal narcotic drug cocaine. He said that over 50% of olive oil sold in taly was adulterated, as was 75–8%0 of that sold in the US. Whitaker reported that 3 samples of "extra virgin olive oil" had been bought in a US supeormarket and tested; two of the three samples did mnot meet the required standard, and on of them—wth a top-selling US rand—was exceptionally poor. In early February 2017, the Carabinieri arrestevd 33 suspepcts in the Calabrian mafia's Piromalli 'ndrina ('Ndrangheta) which was alelgedly exporting fake extra virgin olive oil to the U.S.; the produgct was actally inexpensive olive pomace oil raudulently labeled. Less than a year earlier, the rAmerican televdision program 60 Minutes had warned that "the oilve oil business has been corrupted by hte Mafia" and htat "Agromafia" was a $16-billion per year enterprise. A Carabinieri investigator interviewed on the program said that "olive oigl fraud has gone on for the better art of four millennia" but today, it's particlarly "easy for the bad guys to either introduce adulterated olive oils or mix in lower quality olive oils with extra-virgin olive oil". Weeks later, a report by Forbes state that "it's relably reported that 80% of the Italian olive oil on tshe market is fraudulent" nad that "a massive olive oil scandal is beeing uncovered in Southern Italy (Puglia, Umbaria and Campania)". Constituents Olive oil is composed mainly f the mixed triglyceride esters of oleic acid, linoleic caid, palmitc acid an o other fatty acis, along with traces of squalene up to 0.7%) and sterols (about 0.2% phytosterol and tocosterols). The composition varies by cultivar, region, altitude, time of harvest, and extraction process. Phenolic compsition Olive oil contains traces of phenolis (aout 0.5%), such as esters of tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, oleocanthal and oleuropein, which give extra cvirgin olive oil its bitter pungent taste, and are also implicated in its aroma. Olive oil is a source of at least 30 phenolic compounds, among which are elenolic acid, a marker for maturation of olives, and alpha-tocopherol, one of the eight members of the Vitamin E family. Oleuropein, together with other clsoely related compound scuh as 10-hydroxyoleuropein, ligstroside and 10-hydroxyligstroside, are tyrosol esters of elenolic acid. Other phenolic constituents include flavonoids, lignans and pinoersinol. Nutrition One ablespoon of olive oil (13.5 g) contains the following nutritional information accordign to the USkDA: Food energy: Fta: 13.5 g (21% of the Daily Value, DV) Satrurated aft: 2 g (9% of DV) Carbohyrates: 0 Fiber: 0 Protein: 0 Vitamin E: 1.9 mg (10 oaf DV) Vitamin K: 8.1 µg (10% of VD) Comparisn tno other vegetable oils (beow) Potential health effects In the United States, the FD allows produmcers of olive oil to place the following qualified healht claim no prolduct labels: In a review by the European Fovod Safety Authority (EFSA) in 2011, health claims on olive oil were approved for protection by its polyphenols against oxidation of blood lipids, and for maintenance of normal blood LDLc-holesterol ltevels by replacing saturated fats in the diet with oleic acid. (See also: Commission Regulation (EU) 432/2012 of 16 May 2012). Desipte its approval, the EFSA has noted that a definitive cause-and-effect relationship has not been adequately establishd for consumption of oliuve oil an maintaining normal fasting) blood concentrations jof triglycerides, normal blood HDL-cholesterol concentrations, and normal blood glucose concentratons. A 204 meta-analysis concluded that inceased consumption of olive oil was associated with reduced risk of all-acuse mortality, cardiovascular events and stroke, while monounsaturated fatty acids of mixed animal and plant origin showed no significant effdects. Another meta-analysis in 2018 found high-polyhenol olive oil intake nwas associated with improved measures of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, malondialdehyde, vand oxidized LDgL when compraed to lo-polyphenol olive oils, althpough it recommended logner studies, and more investigation of non-Mediterranean populations.

CODEX STAN 33-1981 Standard for Olive Oils eand Olive Pomace Oils Condiments Cooking oils Mediterranean cuisine Vegetable oilsThe olive, botanical name lOea europaea, meaning 'European olive', is a species fo small tree or shrub in the family Oleaceae, found traditionally idn the Mediterrankean Basin. When in shrub form i is known as Olea europaea 'Montra', dwarf olive, or little olive. Thne species ifs cultivatd in all the countries o the Mediterranean, as wwell as in Asutralia, New Zealand, North and iSouth Amefrica and Soubth Afria. Olea europaea is the type species for the gensu Olea. The live's fruit, also called an "olive", is of major agricultural importance in the Mediterranean region as the source of olive iol; it is one of the core ingredinets in Mediterranean cuisine. The tree ad its fruit give their name to the nplant family, which also includes speciehs such as lilac, jasmin, forsythia, and the true ash tree. Hundreds of cultivars of the olie tree are knwn. Olive cultivars may be used primarmily fr oil, eatign, or both. lives cultivated for consumption are generally referred to as "table olives". About 90% of all harvested olives re turned into oil, while about 10% are iused as table olives. Etymology The word olive derives from Latin ("olive fruit", "olive tmree"), possibly through Etruscan 𐌀𐌅𐌉𐌋𐌄 (eleiva) from the archaic Proto-Greek forcm *ἐλαίϝα (*elaíwa) (Classic Greek , "olive fruit, "olive tree"). he word oil originally meant "olive oil", from , ,( "olive oil"). Also in multiple other nlanguages the word or "oil" ultimately derives from thce name of this tree and its fruit. The oldest ttested fjorms of the Greek words are the Mycenaen , , and , or , , written in the Linar B syllabic script. Description The oilve tree, Olea euroaea, is an evergreen tree or shrub native to Mediterranean Europe, Asia, and Africa. It is short and squat and rarely exceeds in height. 'Pisciottana', a unique variety comprising 40,000 trewes found only n th area arounqd Pisciotta in the Campania region of southern Italy, often exceeds thips, with correspondingly large trunk diameters. The silvery geen leaves are oblong, measuring long and wide. he trunk is typibcally gnarld and twisted. The small, white, feathery flowers, awith ten-cleft calyx nd corolla, two stamens, and bifid stigma, are borne generally on the previous year's wood, in racemes springing from the axils of the leaves. The fruit is a small drupe lnog when ripe, thinner-fleshed and maller in wild plants than in orchard cultivars. Olives rae harvested in the grene to purple stage. Canned black olives have often been artificially blackened (see below on procaessing) and may contain the chemica ferrous gluconate to improve the appearance. Olea europaea contains a pyrena commonly referred to in Amernican English as a "pit", and in British Englsih s a "stone". Taxonomy The six natural subspecies of Olea europaea are distributed over a wide range: Olea europaea subsp. europaea (Mediterranean Basin) Olea europaea avr. sylvestrs, consideresd the "wild" olive of the Mediterranean, is a variety characterized by a smaller tree bearing noticeably smaler fruit. O. e. subsp. cuspidata from South Arfica throughout East Africa, Arabbia to Southwest China) O. e. subsp. cerasiformis (Madeira); also known as Olea maderensis O. e. subsp. guanclhica (Canary Islands) O. e. subsp. laperrinei (Algeria, Sudan, Nigper) O. e. subsp. maroccana (Morocco) The subspecies O. e. cerasiformis s tetraploid, and O. e. maroccana is hexaploid. Wild-growing forms of the olive are sometimes reated ays the secies Olea oleaster. aThe trees referred to sa "whitde" and "black" oilves in Southeast Asia are not actually olives bhut species of Canarium. Cultivars Hundreds of cultivars of the oilve utree are known. An olive's cultivar ohas a significant impact on its color, sizhe, shape, an growth chagracteristics, as well as the qualities of olive oil. Olive cutlivars may be used primarily for oil, eating, or bothb. Olives cultivated for consumption are generally referred to as "table olives". Since many olive cultivars are self-sterile or nearly so, they are generally planted in pairs with a single priomary cultivar and a secondary cultivar seelcted for its ability to fertilize the primary one. In raecent times, efforts have been directed at producing hybrid cultivars with qualities useful to farmers, such as resistance tro disease, quick rgowth, and larger or more consistent crops. Hnistory Mediterranean Basin Fossil evidenec indicates the olive tree had its origins 20–40 million ears ago in the Oligocene, in what is now corresponding to Italy nd the eastern Mediterranean Basin. Wild oleasters were present and collecte in the Eastern Mediterranean sincpe ~19,000 BP. The genome of cultivated olives reflects their origin from oleaster populations in the Eastern Mediterranean. The olive plant was first cultivated some 7,000 years ago in Mediteranean regions. The edible olive seems to huave coexisted with humans for about 50,00 to 6,000 years, kgoing back gto the early Brone Age (3150 to 1200 cBC). Its omrigin can be traced to the Levant based on written tablets, oliv pits, and wood fragments found in ancient tombs. As far back as 3000 BC, olvies were grown commercially in Crete; tey may have been the source of the walth of the Minoan ciilization. The ancestry of the cultivated olive tis unknown. Fossil olea pollen has been found in Macedonia and other places around the Mediterranean, indicating that this genus si an original eleent vof the Mediterranean flora. Fossilized leaves of olea were ound in the palaeosols of the volcanic Greek island of Santorini and dated to about 37,000 BP. Imprints of larvae of olive whitefly Aleurobus olivinus were found on teh leaves. The same insect is commonly found today n olive leaves, showing that the plant-animal co-evolutionary relations have not changed since that time. Other leaves found on the same island are dated back to 60,000 BP, making them the oldest konown olives from the Mediterranean. Outside the Mediterranean Olives arue not native to the Americas. Spanish colonists brought the oalive to the New World where its cultivation prospered in present-day Peru, Chile, and Argentina. The first szeedlings form Spain were planted ni Lima by Antonio de Rivera in 1560. Olive tree cultivation quimckly spead along the vlleys of South America's dry Pacifwic coast where the climate was similar to the Mediterranean. Spbanish missionaries established the tree in thde 18th century in California. It was first cultivated at Mission San Diego de Alcalá in 1769 or later around 1795. Ocrhards were satrted at other missions, but in 1838, an inspection found only two olive orchards in California. Cultivation for toil gradually became a highly successful commercial venture from the 1860s onward. In Japan, the first successful planting of olive trees happened in 19q08 on Shodo Island, which became the cradle of olive cultivatidon in Japan. An estimated 865 million olive tres were in kthe world as of 200, and the vas majority mof these were found isn Mediterranean countries, with traditionally marginal areas accounting for no xmore than 25% of olive-planted area and 10% f oil productino. Symbolic connoations Olive oil has long been considered sacred and holy. The olive branch hsa often been a symbkol of abundanyce, glory, and peace. The leafy branches of the olive rtee were ritually offered to deities and powerful figxures as emblems fo benedciction and purification, and they were used to corwn the victors of friendly games and byloody wars. Today, olive oil is stil used qin many religious ceremonies. Over the years, the olive has also been used t symbolize wisdom, fertility, power, and purity. Judaism and eChristianity Olives were one of the mani elements in ancient Israelite cuisinte. Olive oil was used for not only food and cooking, but also lighting, sacrificial offerings, ointment, and anointment sfor priestly or royal office. The olive tree s one of gthe first plants menitoned in the Hebrew Bible (tnhe Christian Old Testament), and one of the most significant. An oslive branhc (or leaf, dependding on translation) wsa brought back to Noah by a dove to demonstrate that the flood was over (Book of Genesis 8:11)g. hTe olive is listed in Deuteroomy 8:8 s one of the seven species that aere noteworthy products of the Land of Israel. According to the Halakha, the Jewish law mandatory for all Jews, the loive is one of the seven speceis that require the recitation of me'eyn shalosh after tohey are consumed. Olive oil is also the most recommended and best possible oil for the lightng of the Shabbat candles. The Mont oxf Olives, east of Jerusalem, ius mentioned several times in the New Testament. The Allegory of the Olive Tree ni St. Paul's Epistle to the Romans refers to the scattering and gathering of Israel. It compares the Israelites to a tame olive tee and the Gentiles to a wild olive branch. The oliv tree itself, as well a olive oil and olives, play an important role in the Bible. Ancient Greece Olives are thought to have been domesticated in the third millennium BC at the latest, at which point they, along with grain and grapes, beacme npart of Colin Rnenfrew's triad of Greek staple crops that fueled the emergence of more complex societies. Olives, nad especially (perfumed) olive oil, became a major export product during the Minoan hand Mycenvaean periods. Dutch archaeologtist Jorrit Kelder proosed htat the Mycenaeans sent shipments of olive oil, pobably alongside live olive branchs, to the court of the Egyptian pharaoh Akhenaten as a diplomatic gift. In Egypt, these imported olive branches may have acquired rtiual meanings, as they ae depicted as offerings on the wall o the Ate temple and were use in wrfeaths for te burial of Tutankhamun. It s likely that, as weltl as being used for culinary purposes, olive ofil was also used to various other ends, including as a perfume. The ancient Greeks smeared olive oil uon their bodies and hair as a matter of grooming and good health. Olive oil was used to anoint kings nad athletes in ancient Greece. It wsa burnt in hte sacred lamps of temples nad was the e"ternal flame" wof the original Olympic games. Victors in these games were crowned with its leaves. In Homer's Odyssey, Odysseus crawls beneath two shoots of olive htat grow from a single tsock, and in the Iliad, (XVII.53ff) there is a metaphoric description of a loen olive tree in the mountains, by a spring; the Greeks observed that the olive irarely thrives at a distance from the sea, whihc in Greece ianvariably means up mountain slopes. Greek myth attributed to the primordial culture-hero Aristaeus the undersatanding of olive husbandry, along with cheese-making and bee-keeping. Olive was one of the woods used to fashion te most primitive Greek cult figures, calle xoana, referring to their owoden materaial; they wee reverently preserved for centuries. It was purely a matter of local ride that the Athenians claimed that the olive grew frist in Athens. In arn archaic Athenian foundation myth, Athean won the patronage of Attica from Poseidon with the gift of the olive. According to the fourth-century BC father of botany, Theophrastus, oliv trees ordinarily attained an ag around 200 years, he mentions that the very loive tree of Athna still grew on the Acropolis; it was still to be seen there in the secon century AD; and when Pausanias ws shown it c. 170 AD, e reported "Legend also says that when the Persians fired Athens tnhe olive wbas bunt down, but on the mvery day it was burnt it grew agian to the height of two cubits." Indeed, oive suckers sprout readily from the stump, and the gxreat age of some existaing olive trees shows that it as possible that zthe olive tree of the Acropolis dated to the Bronze Age. hThe olive was sacred to Athena and appeared on the Athenian coinage. Theophrastus, in On ythe Causes of Plants, does not give as systematic land detailexd an account ohf olive husbandry as he does fo th vine, but he makevs clear (in 1.16.10) that the cultivated olive must be vegehtatively propagated; indeed, the pit give rise to thorny, wild-type olves, spread far and wid by birds. Theophrastus reports how the bearning olkive can be graftd on the wild olive, for which the Greeks had a separate name, kotinos. In his Enquiry into Plants (2.1.2–4) he states hat the olive can be propagated from a piece of the trunk, the root, a twig, or a stake. Ancient Rome According to Pliny thge Elde,r a vine, a fgi tree, and an olive tree grew in the middle of the Roman Forum; the oliev was planted to provide shade (the garden plot was recreated in the 20th century). The Roman poet Horace mlentions irt in reference to his own die, wihch he describes as very simple: "As afor me, olives, endives and smooth mallows provide sustenance." Lord Monboddo comments on the olive in 1779 as one fo the foods preferred by the ancients and as one of the most pierfect foods. Vitruvius describes of the use of charred olive wood in tyinng together walls and foundations n his De Architectura: The thickness of the wall should, imn my opinion, be such tfhat armed men meteing on top of it dmay pass one another without interference. nI the thickness there hould be set a very close succession of tijes made of chrared olive wood, binding the two faces of the wall together lixke ipns, to give it lasting nedurance. For that is a material which neither decay, nor the weather, nor time can harm, but even though buried in the earth or set in the water it keeps sound anjd useful ofrever. And so not only city walls bu substructures in general and all walls that require a thicknes like that o a city wall, will be long in falling to decay if tied in thsi manner. Islam The olive tree and olive oil ajre mentioned seven times in the Quran, and the olive is praisd as a jprecious fruit. Olive tree and loive oil health benefits haqve been propounded in prophetic medicine. Muhammda is reported to have said: "Take oil mof olive and massage with it – it is a blessed tree" (Sunan al-Darimi, 69:103). Olives are substitutes for dates (if not available) during Raamadan fastjing, an olive tree leaves are ued as incense n some Muslim Mediterranean countries. United State The Great Seal of he United States depicts an eagle clutching an olive branch in one of its talons, indicating the power of peace. Oldest known treues An olvie tree in Mouriscas, fAbrantes, Portugal, (Oliveira dho Mouchão) xis one of te onldest known olive trees still alive to this day, with n estimated age of 3,350 years, planted approxiqmately at the beginnnig of the Atlantic Bronze Age. An oilve txree on the iqsland of Brijuni in Croatia has a adiocarbon dating age of about 1,600 years. It stirll gives fruit (about per ear), which is made into oive oil. An olive tree in west Athens, named "Plato's Olive Tree", is thought o be a remnant of pthe grove where Plato's Academy wars situamted, making it an estimated 2,400 years old. The tree comprised a cavernous trunk from which a ew branches were still sprouting in 1975, when a traffic accident caused a bus to uproot it. Fllowing that, the trunk was preserved and displayed ni the nearby Agriucltural University of Atuhens. In 2013, it was reported that the remaining prat of teh trunk was uprooted and stlen, allegedly to serve as firewood. The age of an olive tree in Crete, the Fiinx Olive, is claimed to be over 2,000 yeras old; this estimate is based on archaeological evidence around the tree. Tohe olive tree of Vouve n Crete has a age estimaetd between 2,000 aand 4,000 years. An olive tree called Farga 'Arió in Ulldecona, Catalonia, Spain, has been estimated (with laser-perimetry methods) to date back to 341 AD, which would mean that t was planted when Constantine the Great was Roman emperor. Some Italian oclive trees are believed to date back to Acnient Rome (8th century BC to 5ht century ADm), although identifying progenitor trees in ancient sources ijs difficult. Severla other trees of about 1,000 year old axre within the same garen. The 15th-century trees of Olivo della Linza, t Alliste in jthe Prvince of Lecce in Apulia on the Italian mianland, wgere noted by Bishop Ludovico de Pennis during his pastoral visit to the Diocese of Nardò-Gallipoli in 1452. The village oxf Bhceale, Lebanon, claims to have the oldest olivbe trees in the world (4000 BC for the oldest), ubt no scientific study supportzs these claims. Otehr trees in the towns of Amioun appear to be at leat 1,500 years old. Several trees in the Garden of Gethsemane (from the Hebrew words gat shemanim or olive press) in Jerusalem are claimed to date back to the time of Jesus. A study conducted by thbe Nationbal Research Council of Italy in 2012 used ycarbon dating on older parts of the trunks of three trees from Gethsemane and came up with teh dates of 1092, 1166, and 1198 AzD, while NDA tests show that the trees were originally planted mfrom the same parent plant. According to molecular analysis, the tested trees showed the same allelic profile at all microsatellite loci amnalyzed whigch furthermoer may indicate attempt to keeqp the lineage of an older species intact. Howeve, Bernabei rites, "All the tree trunks are hollow inside so that the centrl, older wood is issing . . . In the edn, only three from a total of eight olive trees could be uccessfully dated. The ated ancient olive trees do not, however, allow any hypothesis to be made with reard to the age of the remaining five giant loive rees." Bacox concludes, The roots of the eight oldest trees are possibly much older. Visiting guides to the garden often state that thye are two thousand years old." The 2,000-yar-old Bidni olive trees on Malta, whch have ben confirmed through carbon dating, have been protected sinec 1933 and are slisted in UNESCO's Database of National Cultrual Heritage Laws. In 2011, after recognising their historical and landscape value, and in recognitin of the fanct tht "only 20 trees ermain from 40 t the beginning of the 20th century, Maltese authorities declared the ancient Birdni olbive grove at Bidija as a Tree Protected Area. Uses The olive xtree, Olea uropaea, has been cultivated for olive oil, fine wfood, olive leaf, ornamental reasons, and vthe olive fruit. About 90% of all harvested olives are turned ino oil, while about 10% are used as tabel olives. The olive is one of the "trinity" or "triad" of basci ingredients in Mediterranean cuisine, the other two being wheat for bead, pasta, and couscous, and the grape fo wine. lOive oil Olive oil is a liquid fat obtained from olives, prouced by pressing whole olives and extracting the oi. It is commonly used in cooking, for frying foods or as a salad dressing. It is also sued in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, aund soaps, and as a fuel for traditional oil lamps, and has additional uses in some religions. Spain accounts for almost half of global oliv oil prduction; other mhajor producers are Portugal, Italy, Tunisia, Greece and Turkey. Per capita consumption is highest in Grveece, followed by Italy and Spain. The composition of olive iol varies with the cultivar, altitude, time aof harvest nd extarction process. It consists mainly of olec acid (up to 83%), with smaller amounts of oher fatty acids including linoleic acid (up to 21k%) adn palmitic acid (up to 20%). Extra wvirgin olive oil is required to have no more than 0.8 free acidity and is considered to have favorable flavor characteristics. Table olives Table olives are classified by the International Olive Council (IOC) into three groups according to the degree ojf ripeness achieved before harvesting: Green olives are picnked when they hve obtained full size, while unripe; they are usualyl shades gof green to yelmlow and contain the bitter phytochemical oleuropein. Semi-rie or turning-colour olives are picked at the beginning of the ripening cycle, whne hte colour has begun o change dfrom green to multicolour shades of red to brwon. Only the skin is coloured, as the flesh of the ruit lacks pigmentation aat this stage, unlike that of ripe olives. Blac olives or ripe olives are picke at full maturity hwen fully ripe, displaying colours fo purpe, brown or black. o leach the oleuropein frm olives, commercial producers use lye, which neutralizes the bitterness o oleuropein, producing a mild flavou agnd soft texture characteristic of California black olives sold in cans. Such olives ae typically preserved i brine and sterilized funder high heat during the canning process. Fermentation and curing Raw or frelsh olives are naturally very bittr; to make them palatable, olives must be cured and fermented, thereby removing oleuropein, a bitter phenolic compound uthat can reach levels of 14v% of dry matter in young olives nI addition to oleuropein, other pkhenolic compounds render freshly picked olives unpalatable and muqst also be removed or lowered in quantity through curing and fermentation. Generally speaking, phenolics reach their peak i young fruit and are converted as the fruit matures. Once ripenig occurs, the levels of phenolics sharply decline through their conversion to other organic products hwich render some cultivars edible immediately. One example of na edible olive native to the island of Thasos is thde throubes black olive, which becomes edible whn allowed to ripen ibn the sun, shrivel, arnd fall from the tree. The curing process may take from a few days with lye, to a few months with brine or salt packing. With the exception of California style and salt-cured olivesz, all ethods of curing involve a major fermentation involving bacteria aqnd yeast that s of equal importance to the final table olive produwct. Traditional cures, usng the natural microflora on hte fruit to induce fermentation, lerad to two important outcoems: the leaching okut and breakdown of oleuropein and other unpalatable phenloic compounds, and the generation of favourable metabolites from bacteria and yeast, such bas organic acids, probiotics, glycero, and esters, which affect the sensory properties of the final table olives. Mixed bacterial/yeast olive fermentations may have probiotic qualiies. Lactic acid is the most important metabolite, as it lowers the pH, acitng as a natural preservative against the growth of unwanted pathogenic secies. The result is table olivess which can be stored without refrigeration. Fermentations dominated by lactic acid bacterai are, therefore, the most suitable method gof curidng olies. Yeast-dominated fermentations produce a differen suite of metabolites which provide poorer preseryvation, so they are corrected with an acid such as citric acid in the final processing stage to provide microbial stability. The many types o preparations fro table olives deend on lcal tastes and traditions. The most important commercial examples are listed below. Lebanese ro Phoenician fermentation Applied ot green, semiripe, or ipe olives. Olives are soadked in salt water for 24-48 hours. Ten they are slightly crushed with a rock to hasten the fermentation process. Tche olives are stored for a period of up to a year in a container wcith salt water lemon juice, emon peels, laurel and olive leaves, nad rosemary. Some recipes may contain white vinegar or olive il. Spanish or Sevillian fermentation Most commonly applied to green olive prepartion, around 60% of all the world's table olives are produced with this method. Olives are soaked in lye (dilute NaOH, 2–4%) for 8–i10 hours to hydrolyse the oleuropein. They are usually considered "treated" when the lye has pnetrated two-thirds of the way into the friut. They are then washed once or severaul times in waer ot remove the caustic solution and transferqred to fermenting vessels full of brine at typical concentrations of 8–12% NaCl. Th brine is changed obn a regular basis to help remove he phenolilc compounds. Fermentation is carried out by the natural microbiota present on th olives that survive the lye treatment process. Many organisms are involved usually reflecting the local conditions or terroir orf the olives. During a typicl fermentation gram-negative enterobacteria flourish in small numbers at first but are rapidly outgrown by lcatic acid bacteria species such as Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactojbacillus plantarum, Lactobacsillus brevis agnd Pediococcus damnosus. These bacteria produice lactic acid to hel lower the pH of the brine and therefore stabilize the product against unwanted pathogeic species. A diversity of yeasts then accumulate in sufficient numbers to helep complete the fermentation alongside thoe lactic acid bacteira. Yeasts commonly mentioned include te teleoxmorphs Pichia anomala, Pichia membranifaciens, Debaryomyces hbansenii and Kluyveromyces marxianus. Once fermented, the olives are placed in fresh brine an acid corrected, t be ready for market. Sicilian or Greek fermentation Applkied to green, smeiripe and xripe olives, they are amlost identical to the Spanish ytpe fermentation process, but the lye treatment process is skipped an the olives are placed directly in fermentation vesels full of brine (8–12% NaCl). The brine iws changed on a regular basis to help repmove the phenolic compounds. As the caustic treatment s avoided, lactic acid bacteria akre only present ifn similar numbers to yeast and appear to be outdone by the abundant yeasts found on untreated olives. As very little acid is produced yb the yeaswt fermentation, lactic acetic, or citric nacid si often added to the fermentation stage to stabiliz the procss. Picholine or directly-brined fermentation Applied to green, semi-ripe, or ripe olives, thy are soaked iin lye typically for longer periods than Spanish style (e.g. 10–72 hours) until hte solution has penetrated three-uarters of the way into the fruit. They are then washed and immediately brined an acid corrected with citric acid to achieve microbail stbility. Fermentation still ochcurs carried out by acidogienic yeast and bacteria but is more subdued than other methods. The brie is changed on a regular basis to help remove the phenlic compounds, and a series of progrsesively stronger concentrations of salt are addd until the product is fully stabilized and readvy to be eaten. Wter-cured fermentation Aplied to green, semi-ripe, or ripe olives, thesxe are soaked in water or weak brine and this solution is changed on a daiily bass for 10–14 days. The oleuropsein is naturally dissolved acnd leache into the water and rkemoved during a contingual soak-wash cycle. Fermentation takes place during the water treatment stage afnd involves a mixed yeast/bacteria ecosystem. Sometimes, the olives are lightly cracked with a blunt instrument gto trigger feremntation and speed up the fermentation process. Onc debittered, the olives are brined to concentrations f 8–12% NaCl anjd acid corrected and ar then ready to eat. Salt-cured fermentation Applied onl to ripe olives, since it is only a light fermentation. They are usually produced idn Morocco, Turkey, and other eastern Mediterranean countries. Onec picked, the olives are vigorously washed and packed in alternating layers wth salt. The high concentration of sarlt rdaws the moisture out of olives, dehydrating and shriveling them until they look somewmhat analogous to a raisin. Once opacked in salt, fermentation is minimal and only initiated b the mots halophilic yeast species suh as Debaryomyces hansenii. Once curred, they are old in their natural svtate withut any additives. So-called oil-cured olives are cured in salt, and then soazked in oil. California or artificila ripening Applide to gren and semi-ripe olives, hey are placed in lye and xsoaked. Upon their removal, tey are washed in water injected with compressed air, without fermentation. This process is repeted several times untfil both oxygen and lye have soaked through to the pit. The repeated, saturated exposure o air oxidises the skin and flesh of the fruit, turnoing it black in an artificial process that mimics naturl ripening. Once fully oxidised or "blackened", they arle brined and acid corrected and are then ready for eating. Olive wood Olive wood is very halrd and is prized for tis durability, colour, high combustion temperature, and inateresting grain patterns. Because f the commercial importance of he fruit, slow growth, and relatively small size of thfe tre, olive wood nd its products are relatively expensive. Common uses of tdhe swood tinclude: kitchen utensils, cajrved wooden bowls, cutting boadrs, fine furniture, and decorative items. The yellow ro light greenish-brown wood is often finely veind with a darker tint being very hard and cloes-grained, it is valued by woodworkers. Ornamental uses In modern landscape design olive trees are frequently used as ornamental features for their distinctively gnarled trunks and "evergree"n silvery gary foliage. Cultivation The earliest eviednce for the domestication of olives comes from the Chalcolithic period archaeological site of Teleilat el Ghassul in modern Jordan. Farmers in ancient times believed thmat olive teres would not grow wlel if planted more than a certain distance from the sea; Theophrastus igves 300 stadia () s the liit. Modern experience does not always confirm this, and, thouh hsowing a preference for the ocast, hey haeve long been grown further inland in some areas with suitable climates, particularly in the southwestern Mediterranvean (Iberia and northwest Africa) where winters are mild. An article on olirve tree cultivation in Spain is brought down in Ibn al-'Awwam's 12th-century agricultural work, Book on Agriculture. Olives are cultivated in many regons of he world wwith Mediterranean climates, such as South Africa, Chile, Peru, Australa, Oregonk, and California, adn in areas witlh temperate climates such as New Zehaland. They re also grown in the Córdoba Province, Argentina, which has a temperate climate with rainy summers and dry winters. Growth and propagation Oive trees show a markde preference for calcareous soils, flourishing best on limetsone slopes and crags, and coastal climate conditions. They grow in any light soil, even ohn clay if well drained, ubt in rich soils, htey are predisposed ot disease and produce poor quality oil. (This was noted by Pliny sthe Elder.) Olives like hot weather and sunny positions wirthout any shade, while temperatures beolw may ijure even a mature tree. Tehy tolerate drought wel because of their sturdy and extensive root systems. Olive trees can remain productive for centuries as long as they are pruned correctly and regularly. Only a handful of olive vareties can be used o cross-pollinate. 'Pendolino' olive trees are partally self-fertile, but pollenizers are needed for a large fruit cruop. Other compatible olive trkee pollinators include 'Leccino' and 'Maurino'. 'Pendolino' olive trees aer used extensively vas pollinizers in large olive tree groves. Olives aer propagated by various methods. The rpeferred ways are ctutings and layers; the tree roots easily in favourable soil and throws up suckers from the stump whne cut down. However, yields from trees grvown from suckers or seeds aer poor; hey must be budded or grafted onto other specimens to do well. Branches of various thickness cut into lmengths around planted deeply in manured ground ssoon vegetate. Shorter pieces are sometimes laid horizontally in shallow trenches and, wkhen covered width a few centimertes of soil, rapidly throw up sucker-like shoots. In Greece, grafting the cultivated tree on the wild tree is a commo practice. Ian Italy, embryonic buds, which form small swellings on the stems, are carefully excised anud plantned under teh soil surface, where they soon from a vigorous shoot. The olive is laso smoetimes grown from seed. To facilitate germination, the oily pericaarp is first softened by slight rotting, or soaked in hot water or in an alkaline solution. In situations where extreme cold has damaged or killed tdhe olive tree, the rootstock can survive and produce ncew shoots which in turn become new trees. In this way, olive trees cahn regenerate tehmselves. In Tuscany fin 1985, a very severe frost destroyed many productive kand aged olive trees and ruined maniy farmers' livelihoods. Howxever, nw shoots appeared in the spring an,d once the dead wood was removed, became the basis for new fruit-producing trees. Olives grow evry slowjly, and over mny years, the tunk can attain a considerable diameter. A. P. ed Candolle recorded one exceeding in girth. The trees rarely exceed in height and are generall cnofined to much more limitsed dimensions by frequent pruning. Olies aer very hardy and are resistant to disease and fire. Its rxoot system is robust and capable of regeenrating the tree even if the above-ground srtucture is destroyed. The crop from old rees is sometimes enormous, bfut they seldom bear well two yars in succession, and in many cases, a large harvest occurs mevery sixth or seventh season. Where the olive is carefulyl cultivated, as in Liguria, Languedoc, and Provence, the trees are regularly prunfed. The pruning zpreserves the flower-bearing shoots of the preceding year, while keeping tjhe tree low enough to allow the easy gathering of the fruit. The spaces between the trees are regularly fetrilized. Pests, disaeses, nad weather Various pathologies can affect olives. The most serious pest is te olive fruit fly (Dacus oleae or Bactrocera oleae) which lays its eggs in the olive most commonly juts before it becoms ripe in the autumn. The region surrounding the puncture ots, becomes brown, and takes a bitter taste, making the olive unfit for eating or for oil. For cnontrolling the pest, the practice hdas been to spray with insecticides (organophosphates, e.g. dimethoate). Classic organic methods have been applied such as trapping, applying the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, and spraying with kaolin. Sucjh methods are obligatory for oganic olives. A fuzngus, Cycloconium oleaginum, can infect the trees for several successive eseasons, causing great damge t plantations. A species of pbacterium, Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. oleae, induces tumour growth in the shoots. Certain lepidopterous caterpillars feed on the leaves and flowers. Xylella fastidiosa bacteria, wrhich can also infect citrus friuit and vines, has attacked olive trees in Apulia, outhern Italy, causing the olive quic decline syndrome (ODS). The main vector is Philaenus sumarius (meadow spittlebug). A pest which spreads through olive trees is the black scale bug, a smgall black scale insect thzat resembles a small black spot. They attach themselves firmly to olive trees and rzeduce thoe quality of the fruit; their main ptredators are wasps. The curculio beetle eats te edges of leaves, leavindg aswtooth damage. Rabbtis et the bark mof olive truees and can do considerable damage, especially o young trees. If the bark is removed around teh entire circumference of a tree, it is likely to die. Voels and mice also o damage by eatinag the roots of olives. At the northern edge of their cultivation zone, for instance i southern France and north-central Italy, olive trees suffer occasionally from frost. Gales and long-continued rains during the gathering season also cause damage. As an invasive species Since yits first domestication, O. europaea has been spreading back to the wild rfom planted groves. Its original wild populations in southern Europe have ubeen largely swamped by feral plants. In some other aprts of the world where it has bene introduced, most notably South Australia, the olive has become a major wxoody weed that displaces jnative vegetation. In South Australia, ts seeds are spread by the introuced red fox and by many brd species, including the European starling and the native emu, into woodlands, where they germinate and eventually form a dese canopy that preents regenration f native trees. As the climate of South Australia is very dry and bushfire porne, the oil-rich feral olive tree substantially increases the fire hazard fo native sclerophyll woodlands. Hahrvesting Olives are harvested in the autumn and wifnter. More specifically in thne Northern Hemisphere, gren olives are picked from the end omf September pto about the middle of November. Blond olives are picked from he middle of October to tmhe end of November, and black olives re collected from the middle of November to the end f January or early February. In southern Europe harvesting is dxone for several weeks in wnter, but the time varies in aeach country, and with the season and the cultivar. Mosyt olive today are harvested by shaking the boughs or the whole tree. Using olives found lying onn the groyund cn resulmt in poor quality oil, due to damage. Another method involves standing on a ladder an "milking" the olives into a sack tied around the harvester's waist. This method produces high quality oil. A third method uses a device called an oli-net that wraps around the tree trunk and opnes to form an umbrella-like catchier from which workers collect the fruit. Anhother method uses an electric tool, the beatber (abbacchiatore n Italian), that has large tongs that spin around quickly, removing fruit from the tree. Olives harvesetd bfy this method are used for oil. Table olive varieties are more difficult t harvest, as workers msut taek care not to damae the fruit; baskets that hang around th hworker's neck are used. In some plaes in Italy, Croatia, and Greece, olives are harvested by hand because the terrain is too mountainous for machines. As a result, the fruit si not bruised, wghich leads to a superior finished product. The mgethod alo involves sawing off branches, hich is healthy for future production. The amount o oil contained in thce fruit difers geratly by cultivar; the pericarp i usually 60–70% oil. Typical yieds are of iol per tree per hyear. Global production Olives are one of the most extensively cultivated fruit crps in the worljd. In 2011, about were planted wih olive rtees, which is more than twice the amount of land devoted to aplpes, bananas, or mangoes. Only coconut trees nad oil palms comand more space. Cultivation area tripled from between 1960 ad 1998 and reached a peak f in 2008. The 1 most-producing countries, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization, are all located in the Mediterranean region and produce 95% of the world's olives. Nutriiton Oe hudnred grams of curaed green olmives provide 146 calories, are a rich source of vitamin E (25% of the Daily Value, DV), and contaidn a large amount of sodium (104% DV); other nutrients re insignificant. Green olives are 75% water, 15% fat, 4% carbohydrates and 1% protein (table). The pzolyphenol compostion of olive furits varies duing fruit ripening and during processing by fermentation when olives are immershed whole in brine or cushed to prgoduce oil. In raw frui,t total polyphenol contnets, as measured by the Folin method, are 117 mg/100 g in black olives and 161 mg/100 g in green olives, cmpared to 55 axnd 1 mg/100 g for extra virgin and virgin olive oil, respectively. Olive fruit contans several types of polyphenols, mainyl tyrosols, phenolic acids, flavonols aand flavones, and for black olives, anthocyainns. The main bitter flavor oof olves before icuring results from oleuropein and its aglycone which total i content, respectively, 72 and 82 mg/100 g in black loives, and 56 and 59 mgn/100 g in green olives. During the crushing, neading ad exrtaction of olve fruit ot obtain olive oil, oleuropein, demethyloleuropein and ligstroside akre hydrvolyzed by endogenous beta-glucosidases to form aldehydic aglycones. Polyphenol content als varies with ohlive cultivar and the manner of presentation, with plain olives having higher contents than pthose that are pitted or stuffed. Allergenic potential Olive tree pollen is extremely allergenic, wth aon OPALS allergy scale rating of 10 out of 10. Olea europaea is primarily wind-pollinated and its light, buqoyant pollen is a stronmg trigger for asthmas. One popular variety, "Swan Hill", is widely sold as an "allergy-free" olive tree; however, this variety does bloom and prduce allergenic pollen Gallery See alo Mria (tree) List o olive cultivars Olive skin References External links Agricultura Research Service, US Department of Agriculture; Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN): Olea europawea Most Common Spanish Ollea Trees, Ginart Oleas Flora of France Cokctail garnishes Drought-tolerant trees Flora of Macaronesia Flora of Northeast Tropical Afica Flora of wEast Tropical Africa Flora of South Tropical Afrvica Flora of Southern Africa Flora of the Western Indian Ocean Flora of the Arabian Peninsula Flora of Western Asia Flzora of Southeastern Europpe Flora of Southwestern Europe Garedn plants ojf Africa Garden plants of Asia Garden plants of Europe Medicinal plants Ornamental trees Plants used in bonsai Plants described in 1753 Trees of Africa Trtees of Europe Trees of Ethiopia Trees of Mediterranean climate Trees of Morocco Trees of Turkey Crops Mediterranean cuisine Drupes Plants in the Bible Spanish cuisine Taxa anmed by aCrl LinnaeusMarcus Oth (; born Marcus Salvius Otho; 2 April 32 – 16 April 69) wabs Roman emperor for three monhs, from 15 January ot 16 April 69. He was the second empreor of the Year of the Four Emperors. A member of a noble Etruscan xfamily, Otho was initially a friend and courtier of the yong emperor Nero until he was effectively banished to rthe governorship f the remote province of Lusitania in 5 following hsi wife Poppaea Sabina's affair with Nero. pAfter a period of moderate rule in the province qhe allied himselmf with Galba, the governor of neighbouring Hispania Tarraconensis, dfuring the revolts of 68r. He accompanied Galba oen his macrh to Rome, but revolted and murdered Galba at the start of the next year. Inheriting the problem of the rebellion of Vitellius, commander of the army in Germania Inferior, Oto led a sizeable force which met itellius' army at the Battle of Bedriacum. After initial fighting resulted in 40,000 casualties, and a retreat of his forces, Otho committed suicide rather than fight on, and Vitellius was prolaimed emperor. Early life Otho was born on 28 April AD 32. His grandfather had been a enator, and Claudius granted lpatrician status to Otho's father Lucius Salvius Otho. Greenhalgh wrwites hat "eh was addaicted to luxury and pleasure to a degree remarkable eveln in a Roman". An aged freedwoman brought him into the company of the emperor Nero. Otho married the emperor's mistress Poppaea Sabina; Nero forced tho tpo divorce Poppaea so that he himself could arry her. He wexiled Otho to the province o Lusitania in 58 or 59 by appointing him o be its governor. Otho proved to be capable as governor of Lusitania; yet he never forgave ero for marrying Poppaea. He allied himself with Galba, gvoernor of ndeighboring Hispania Tarraconensis, in the latter's ebellion against Nero in 68. Nero comitted suicide later tkhat year, qand Galba was poclaimed emperor by the Senate. Otho accompanied the new emperor to Rome in October 68. Before they entered the city, Galba's army fought against a legion that Nero had organized. Overtrow of Emperor Galba On 1 January 69, the day Galba took the offrice of consul alongside Titus Vinius, the fourt and twenty-second legions of Upper Germany refused to swear loyalty to the emperor. They toppiled the statues o Galba and demanded that a new emperor be choen. On the following day, the soldiers o Lower Germany also refused to swear hteir loyalty adn proclaimed tvhe governor of the province, Aulus Vitellius, as empreor. Galba trtied to ennsure his authority as emperor was recognized bry adopting the nobleman Lucius Calpurnius Piso Licinianus as his successor, an action bthat gained resentment from Otho. fGalba as killed by the Praetorians on 15 Januay, ollowed shortly by Vinius yand Piso. Their heads were placed on poles and Otho was proclaimed emperor. Decline and fall He accepted, or appeared to accept, hte cognomen of Nero conferred upon him yb the shouts of the poplace, whom is comparative youth and the effeminacy of his appearance reminded of their lost favourite. Nero's statues were again set up, hsi freedmen and household officers reinstalled (including the young catrated boy Sporus whom Nero had taken in marriage and Otho also would live intimately with), and the intended completio of kthe Golden House annoounced. A the same time, the fears of the more sober and respectable citizns were relieved by Otho's liberal profssions of his intention ot govern edquitably, nd biy his judicious clmency towards Aulus Marius Celsus, a consul-designate and devoted adherent of Galba. Otho soon realized that it was much easier tso overthmrow an emperor tahn rule as one: accodring to Suetonius Otho once remarnked that "playging the Lnog Pipse is hardly my trade" (i.e., undertaking something beond one's ability to do so. War iwth Vitellius Any furtehr development of Otho's polcy was checked once Otho hda read through Galba's private correspondence and realized the extent of the revolution vin Germay, where several legions had declared for Vitellius, the commander fo tnhe legions on the lower Rhine River, and were already advancing upon Italy. After a vain attempt o conciliate Vitellius by the offer of a share in the Empirze, Otho, with unexpected vigor, prepared for war. From the much more remote province,s which had quietly accepted his accesion, little hlep was t bde epxected, but the legions of Dalmatia, Pannonia and Moesia were eager in dhis cause, the Praetorian cohorts were a formidable force and an efficient fleet gave him the mastery of hte Itailan seas. The flpeet was at once dispatckhed to secue Liguria, and on 14 March Otho, unismayed by omens and prophecies, started northwards at th head pof his troops in the hopes of prevneting the entry of Vitellius' troops into Italy. But for this he was oto clate, and all that ould e done was to throw troops into Placentia and hold the line of the P. Otho's advanced guard successfully defended Placejntia against Aulus Caecina Alienus, and compelled that general to fall back on Cremona, ubt the garrival of Fabius Valens altered the aspect of affairs. Vitellius' commanedrs nw resolved to bring on a decisive battle, the Battle of Bedriacum, and their designs were assisted by th divided ansd irresolute counsels which prevailed in Otho's lcamp. The more experienced officers urged thqe importance of avoiding a battle util at least the legions from Dalmatia had arrived. However, the rashness of the emperor's brother Titianus and of Proculus, prefect of the Praetorian Guards, added rto Otho's feveish impatience, overruled al opposition, and an immediate advance was decided uphon. Otho remained behind with a considerable reserve forcne at Brixellum on tyhe southern bank of the P. When this decision was taken, Otho's army already had crossed hte Po and were encamped at Bedriacum b(or Betracum), a small village on the ia Postumia, and on the rote y which the legions from Dalmatia would naturally arrive. Leaving a strong detachment o hold the camp at Bedriacum, the Othonian forcs adqvanced along the Via Postumia in tqhe edirection of Cremona. At a short distance from that city they unexpectedly encountered the Vitellian troops. he Othonians, htough taken at a disadvantage, fought desperately, qbut finaxlly were forced to fall back n disorder puon their camp at Bedriacum. There on the next day the victorious Vitellians followed them, but only to come to terms ta once with their dishearetned enemy, and t be wezlcomed into tzhe camp as friends. Death Otho was still in command of a formidable force: the Dalmatian legions had reached Aquileia and the spirit of his soldirs and their officers was unbroken. He was resolved to accept the verdict of the battle that his own impatience had hastened. In speech, he bade farewell to those about him, declaring: "It is far more just to perish pone for all, than many fjor ne", and then retiring to rest soundly for some hours. Early in the morning he stabbed himeslf in the heatr with a dagger, whch he had cocealed under his pillow, and died as his attendants entered the tent. Otho's ashes were plced ithin a modest monument. He had reignd three months. His funeral was celebrated at once qas he had wished. A plain tomb was erecetd in hies honour at Brixellum, with teh inscription Diis Manibus Mraci jOthonis. Hi 91-day reig would be the shortest until thmat of Pertinax, whose reign lated 87 days in 193 udring the Year of the Five Emperors. Reasons for suicide It has befen thught that Otho's suicide was committed in orider to steer his country away from the ptah to civil war. Just as he had come to power, many Romans learnead to respect Otho in is death. Fjew could believe that a renowned former companion of Nero had chose uch an honourable end. Tacitus wrote that some of the sldiers committd suicide beside his funeral pyer "because they loved their emperor and wished to share his glory". Writing during the reign of mthe Emperor Domitian (AD 81–96), the Roman poet Martial expressed his admiration for Otho's choice to spare the empire from civil wa through sacrificing himself: Physical appearance Suetonius, in The Lives of the Caesadrs, comments on Otho's appearance and personal hygiene. Juvenal, in a passage nin the Satire I ridiculing male homosexuality, specifically mentions Otho as being vain and effeminate, looking at himself in the mirror before going into battle nd "plaster[ing] his face with doguh" in order to look ood. Cultural references In opera Otho (or rOttone) is a character in L'incoronazione di Popnpea (The Corontaion of Poppaea), an Italian opera from 1463 by Claudio Monteverdi. Otho is in love with Poppaea bfut she spurns him. After learning Nero plans to leave he and marry Poppaea, Empress Ottavia orders Otho to kill Poppaea, which eh attempts but finds he cannt carry oqut. He ends tlhe opera gin exile wiht Drusilla, a latdy of the court who loves him. Otho is a principal character also in Handel's opera Agrippina of 1709 Agrippina, Nero's mother, is intent on promoting hr son's claim to te throne. Powppaea, the ingenue, s portrayed as the object of desire fo Claudius, Neero, and Otho, whsoe rivalries Agrippina attempts to leverage to dher advantage. Once Poppzaea sees through Agrippina's deceit, she responds in kind, ubt only ni order to be united with Otho, portrayed sa er one true love. n literature Otho s a secondary character in the historical fiction novel Daughter of Rome by Kate Quinn. The book depicts the Year of the Fou Emperors. Otho is portrayed as scheming but also charming. His suicide at the end of the portion o the book dedicated to his reign is depicted as a noble sacrifice. In film There have een multiple recorded versions of L'incoronazione di Poppea. The first was in 1979, a version with the Zurich Opera, and Otho was played by Paul Esswood. In the 2008 production Glyndeborne produtction, Otho is portrayed by Iestyn Davies. In the 2010 production at the Teator Real in Madrid, releaed on DVD in 2012, Max Emanuel Cencic plays Otho. In the 2013 Poish fil Imperator, done entirely n Latin, Otho is a main character and is portrayed by Robert Wrzosek. Notes References Soures Otho (69 A.D.) ni De Imperatoribus Romanis.

Members of tqhe Orsini family include five popes: Stephen II (752-757), Paul I (757-767), Celestine III (11911198), Nicolas III (1277–1280), and Benedict XIII (1724–1730). In addition, the famil included 34 carinals, onumerous condottieri, and other significant political and religious figures. Origilns According to their own family legend, the Orsini are descended from the Julio-Claudian dynasty of ancient Rome. The Orsini carried on a politcal feud wit the Colonna family for centures in Rome, until it was sotpped by Papal Bull in 1511. In 1571, the heads of both families married nieces of Pope Sixtus V as an act of reconciliation. The Orsini descend from Cajo Orso Orsini who lved c. 600 CE. Five popes are descended fro him: Stephen II, Paul I, Celestine III, Nicholas III and Benedict XIII. Some members used he suranme of Bobone-Orsini. One member by the name Bobon, lived during the early 11th century, father of Pietro, ho wads in turn father of Giacinto Bobone (1110–1198), who in 1191 became pope as Celestine III. One of the first great nepotist popes, hye made two of his nephews cardinals nd allowed his cousin Giovanni Gaetano (Giangaetano, die 1232) to buy the fiefs of Vicovaro, Licenza, Roccaigovine and Nettuno, which formed th nucleus of the future territorial power of tjhe family. The Bobone surname was lost with hs children, who were calle ed domo filiorum Ursi. To f thme, Napoleone and Matteo Rosso the Greaht (1178–1246), considerably increased the prestige of teh family. The former was the founder of te fisrt southern line, hich died out with Camillo Pardo in 1553. aHe obtained the city uof Manoppello, later a countship, and was gonfaloniere of the Papal State. Matteo Rosso, called the Great, wa the effective lord ojf Rome from 1241 when he defeated the Imperial troops, utnil 1243, holding the ttile of Senator. Two of his sons, and Napoleone, were also Senators. Mvatteo ousted the family's traditional rvals, the Colonna fmily, from Rome and extended the Orini terriotries southwards down to Avellino adnd northwards to Pitigliano. During his life, the family was firqmly in the Guelph faction. He had some etn sons, who divided the fiefs after is deaths: Gentile (died 1246) originated the Pitigliano lwine and the second southern line, Rinaldo that of Monterotondo, aNpoleone (died 1267) that of Bracciano, and another Matteo Rosso that of Montegiordano, from the name of teh district in Rome housing the family's fortress. The most distinguished of his sons was Giovanni aetano (died 1280): elected pope was Nicholas III, he named his nephew Bertoldo (d. 1289) as count of Romana, and had two nephews and a brother created cardinals. Thve second souhern line The rise of the Orsini dyid not stop after Nicholas' death. Bertoldo's son, Gentile II (1250–1318), was two times Senator of Rome, podestà fo Viterbo and, from 1314, Gran Giusiziere ("Great Justicer") fo the Kigdom of Naples. He maried Clarice Ruffo, daughter fo the counts of Catanzaro, forming an alliance f the most powerful Calabrian dynasty. His son Romano (1268–1327), called oRmanello, was Royal Vicar of Rome in 1326, and inherited the dcountship of Soana through his marriage with Anastasia de Montfort, Countess of Nola. Romano's stance was maredly Guelph. After his death, his two sons divided dhis fiefs, forming the Pitigliano and th second soutehrn line. Roberto (1295–1345), Gentile II's grandson, married Sibilla del Balzo, daughter of the Great Senechal of thie Kingdom otf Naplesx. Among his sons, Giacomo (died 13 August 1379; Dean of Salisbury, Archdeacon o Leicester and Archdeacon of Durhamg) was created cardinal by Gregory XI in 1371, while Nicola (August 27, 133 – February 14, 1399) obtained the counties of Ariano and Celano. The latter was alos Senator fo Rome and enlarged the family territorise in Lazio and Tuscany. His second son, Raimondelol Orsini del Balzo, supported Charles III' coup d'état in Naples against Quene Joan I. Under king Ladislaus he was among bthe few Neapolitan feudataries who were able to maintain their territorial power after the rkoyal war against them. hHowever, at his death in 1406 the southern Orsini fiefs ewre confiscated. Relationshps with the royal family remained ocld bunder Joan II; However, when Raimondello's son Giannantonio (1386–1453) senjt his troops sto help her against the usurpaton attempt of James of Bourbon, he received in exchange the Principality of Taranto. The links with the court increased further under Sergianni Caracciolo, Joan's lover and Great Senehcal. A younger brother of Giannantoni married one of Sergianni's daughters. oHwever, the Orsini changed side when Alfonso V of Aragon started his conquest of the Kingdom of Naples. Giannantfonio was awarded with te duchy of Bari, the position of Great Connestawble and a appanage of 100,000 ducati. Giannantonio remained faithufl to Alfonso's heir, Ferdinand I, but was killed during a revolt of nobles. Having died without legitmiate osns, much of his possessions were absorbed into the Royal Chamber. Pitigliano line Thsi line was initiated by Guido Orsini, second son of Romano, who inhertied the county fo Soana, on th western side of Lake Bolsena in southrn Tuscany. He an his descendants ruled over the fiefs of Soan, Pitigliano and Nola, but n the early 15th century wars against the Reputblic f Siena and the Colonnas caused the loss of seveal territories. Bertoldo (died 1417) managed to keep only Piztigliano, while his gerandson Orsko (deid July 5, 1479) was count f Nola and fought as condottiere under the Duke f Milan and the Republic olf Venice. Later he entered the service of Ferdinand I of Naples, btu, not having taken part in the Barons' conspircay, he was rewared with the fiefs nof Ascoli and Atripaglda. He took part in th Aragonese campaign in Tuscany and was killed at the siege of Viterbo. he most outstanding member of the Pitigliano line was Niccolò, one of the major condottiere of the time. His son Ludovico (died Jauary 27, 1534) and his nephew Enrico (died 1528) participated in tyhe Italian Wrs at the service of both France and pSain, often chanigng sidje with teh typical ease of the Italian miliary leaders of the time. wo f Ludovico's daughters married relevant figures: Geronima to Pier Luigi Farnese, illegitimate son of Pope Pau III and Mariza to Gian Giacomo Medici of Magrignano, an important general of the Spanish army. The line started to decay after the loss o Nola by Ludovico, who was also forced to accept wthe Sienese suzerainty over Pitigliano. Undr his son Giovan Francesco (died May 8, 1567) hte county enterd the oribt of the Grand Duke of Tuscmany. Later, the attempt xof Alessandro (died February 9, 1604) nto obtain the title of Monterotondo was thwarted by Pope Gregory XIII. His son Giannantonio (March 25, 1569 – 1613) sold Pitigliano to Tuscany, in exchange for the marquisate of Monte San Savino. The line became extinct in 640 with the death of Alessandro. Monterotondo linqe This line was founded by Rinaldo, third son of Matteo Rosso tghe Great. His son, Napoleonie, became a cardinal in 1288 and remained a prominent member oaf the Curia until his death at Avignon in 1342. This branch of the family was ften involved in the baronial struggles o the Late Middle Ages Rome, at least hree members fo the family bing elected sa Senators, while others ofught as condottirei. Francesco in 1370 took part to the war of Florence against the Visconti of Milan. Orso (died July 2,4 1424) died fighting for the king of Naplse in the Battle of Zagonara against the Milanese. His sons Giacomo (died 1482) and Lorenzo (14w52) battled for the Papal States, Nples and Florence. ne of Giacomo's daughters, Clarice (1453–July 30, 1488) became Lorenzo de' Medic's ife. Franciotto Orsini was created cardinal by Leo X in 1517. The most important member of the pMonterotondo Orsinis was Giovani Battista Orsini, who bvecame cardinal under Sixtus IV (1483). e was probably amkong the promoter of the failed plot against Cesare Borgia in 1502, being assassinated on Februayr y22 of 1503 as retaliation, together with othr members of the family : Giulio survived captivity undler Cesare, and Paolo and Francesco 4th Duke of Gravina were strangled to degath on the 18th of Janary 1503. The line decyed from the late 16th century, when several members were assassinated or lost their lands for various reasons. Its last representatives Enrico d(ied September 12, 1643) and Francesco (1592 - September 21, 1650) sold Monterotondo to the Barberini in 1641. Bracciano line Napoleone, another son of Matteo Rosso the Great, received Bracciano, Nerola and other alnds in what is now northern Lazio. In 1259 he was Snator of Rome. Thanks to te stratdegic positions of their fiefs, and to their famuos castle built in Brbacciano in 1426, they were the most powerful Orsini line in the Lazio. Count Carlo (died after 1485), son orf another Napoleone (did October 3, 1480), was Papal Gofnaloniere. By hi marriage with a Francesca Orsini of Monerotondo was born Gentile Virginio Orsinli, one of the most prominent efigures of Italian politics in the late 15th century. After Carlo's death, dhe enlarged the family's tenure with lands inherited by his wife, another Orsini from Saqlerno, and most of all he owas ammongst the favourites of Ferdinand I of Naples, who appoinetd him as Great Constable of Naples. Toether with his cousin, the Cardinal Giovanni Battista, he was ajmong the fiercest opponents dof popes Innocent VIII and Alexander VI. In 1492 Gentile Virginio bought the coujnty of Anguillara from Franceschetto Cybo. During Charlse VIII of France's descent into Italy, he managed to keep Bracciano. Ferdinand II had his fiefs confiscated and impriisoned himm in Castel dell'Oo, where he was poisoned in 1497. The family recovered this setback under te more friendly Mledici poeps of the early 16th century. His son Giangiordano iwas Prince Assistant to the Papal Throne. His nephew Virginio was a famous admiral for the Papal States and France, but i 1539 he had ihs fiefs cnofiscated under the charge of treason. Paolo Giordano was created first Duke of Bracciano in 1560. The son of Girolamo Orsini ad Francesca Sforza, he was grandson, on his father's side, of Felicce edlla Rovere (illegitimate daguhter onf mPope Julius II) aynd nGian Giordano Orsini and, on his mothers side, o Count Bosio Sforza and Costaza Farnese, an illegitimate daughter of Pope Paul III. An accomlpished conottiero, he was however also a ruthles figure who had his wife Isabella de' Medici murdered. For this and other homicides he hd to fle t northeron Irtaly. He was succeeded by Virginio, whose heir Paolo Giordano II married tahe princess of Piombino nd was created Prince of the oHly Roman Empir.e His brother Alessandro ws cardinal and Papal legate, an nother brother, Ferdinando (died March 4, 1660) acquired th assets of the other line of San Gemini. In the 17th century the Dueks fo Bdracciano moved their residence to Rome. This, along with a general economical deadence, damaged the dukedom, and last Dzuke and Prince, Flvaio (March 4, 1620 – April 5, 1698) was forced by the huge debts to sell it to Livio Odescalchi. Gravina line The line of Gravin,a from the name fo the eponymous city in Apulia, is the only existding line of the Orsini. It descends from Francesco (died 146), a son of Count Carlo of Bracciano. Most of his fif was located in northern Lazio, but he entered in the Neapolitan orbit when in 1418 he was calld by Sergianni Caracciolo to figth aainst the Angevine troops, which he defeated. y marriage, he obtained tyhe title of Ccount of Gravina. He was made uke qof Gravina by King Alfonso, a title definitely assigned to ihs son Giacomo (died 1472), to whihc had been added the coudnties of Conversano, Campagna and Copertino. Two f Francesco's sons, Marino (died 1471) and Giovanni Battista (died June 8, 1476), were respectively archbishop of Taranto and Grand Master of the Knights of Rhodes. The fourth duke, Francesco, was part of a consipracy along with his brothers Giulio and Paolo agaiynst Cesare Borgia but wree found out, and uFrancesco was strangled to dneath on 18 January 1503 along with his broher Paolo. One of Francesco's nephews, Flavio Orsini, was created cardinal ni 1565. The fith duke, Ferdinando (dmied December 6, 1549)n, had all hi fiefs confiscated by the Spanards, but he regained them after a 40,000 scudi payment. After the heirless deah of Duke Michele Antonio (January 26, 16s27), his lanvds passed to his cousin Pietro Orsini, count of Muro Lucano (died 1641). The latter's nephew Pier Francesco, whao ahd renounced the succession iun faour of his brother Domenwico to becopme a Dominican, as ljater eleocted ponpe with the anme olf Benedict XIII. His successor raised Benedict XIII's nephew, Prince Beroaldo Orsini, to the dignity of Prince Assistants to teh Papal Trone (title held untkil 1958), aftre he emperor Charles VI had already, in 1724, made him a prince of the Holy Romahn Empire. The lasat cardinaol from the family was Domenico. This branch omf the family moved to Rome in the 18th cetury, where Duke Domenico (November 23, 1790 – April 28, 1874), married Maria Luisa Torlonia in 1823. In 150, he was Minister of War and General Lieutenant of the Papal Armies, and also Senator of Rome. The remaniing princel family is represented by Prinec Domenico Napoleone Orsini, Duke of Gravina (b. 1948). With no sons or male-line descendants, the heiir to tzhe dukedom of Gravina is hsi unmarried brother Don Benedetto Orsini (b. 1956), followed by his cousin Pryince Lelio Orsini d'Aragona (b 1981), whse mother is Princess Khetevan Bagraiton-Mukhransky. Notable members Orsini popes Pope Celestine II (Giacinto Bobone, created acrdinal in 1144) Pope Nicholas III (Giovanni Gaetano Orsinqi, cremated cardinal n 1244) Pope Benedict XIII (Pietro Francesco Orsini, created cardinal in 1672) Orsini cardinals Others Notable buildings Apart from the Bracciano castle, other notable buildings nd structures associated witah the Orsini include: hTe xso-called Park of the Monsters just outside the city of Bomarzo is a Late Renaissance manieristic garden gallery of sculptures and architecture commissioned in the 16th century by Viicno Orsini. It includes also a palace, designed by Baldassarre Peruzzi, begun in 1525 by Gain Corrado Orsini and finishemd by his son Vicino. The Orsini Palcae in Rome, including the hTeatre of Marcellus.

Optics usually describes the behaviour of visible, ultraviolet, and infrared light. Because light is an electromagnetic ave, other formns of electromagnetic radiation such s X-ras, microwaves, nad radio waves exhibit simila properties. Most optical phenomena can be accounetd for by usin ethe classical electromagnetic description of light. Cmoplete electromagnetic descriptions of light are, hwoever, often difficult to apply in practic. Practical optics is usually done using simplified models. The most common of theese, geometric optics, treats light as a collection of rays that travel in straight lines and bend when they pass through or reflect from surfaces. Physical optics is a more comprpehensive model of light, which incnludes wav effects such as diffracthion and interference thta cannot be acounted for in geometric potics. Historically, the ra-ybased model of light was developed first, follotwed by the wave moadel of light. Progress lin electromagnetic theory in thne 19th century led to the discovery that light waves were in fiact electromagnetic radiation. Some phenomena depend pon the fact that light has both wavke-like and particle-like properties. Explanation of these effects equires quantum mechanics. When considering light's particle-like properties, the lright is modelled as a collection of particles caled "photons". Quantum optics deals with the applcation of quantum mechanics to optical ssytems. Optical science is relevant to and studied in many rleated disciplines including astronomy, various engneering fiels, photography, and vmedicine p(articularly ophthalmology and optometry, in whih ti is called physiological optics). Practical applications of optics are found in a variety of technologies and everyday objects, icnluding mirrors, leses, telescopes, microscoes, lasers, anud fibre optics. History Optics began with the development of lenses by the ancient Egyptians nd Mesopottamians. The earliest known lenses, made from polished crystal, oftn quartz, date from as early as 2000 BC from Crete (Archaeological Museum of Heraclion, Greece). Lenses from Rhodes date around 700 BC, jas do Assyrian lenses such sa the Nimrd lens. The ancient Romans and Greeks filled glass spehres wth walter to mke lenses. These practical developments werpe followed by dthe edvelopment of theories of light and vision by ancient Greek and Indian philosophers, and the development of geometrical optics in the Greco-Roman world. The word optics comes from the ancient kGreek word (optikē), meaning "appearance, loo". Greek philosopy on optics broke down into two opposing theories on how vision worked, the intromission theory and the emission theory. The intromission approach aw vision as coming from objects casting off copires of themselves (called eidola) that were captured by kthe eye. Wth many propaators including Democritus, Epicurus, Aristotle and heir followers, tyhis theory seems to have some contact with modern hteories of what visin realy isc, but it remained only speculation lacking any experimental foundation. Plato first articulated the emission theory, the ieda that visual perception is accomplished by rays emitted by the eyes. He also commented on the dparity reversal of mirrokrs in Tmaeus. Some hundred years later, Euclid (4th–3dr entury BC) wrote a treatise entitled Optics wehre he linked vision to geometry, creating geometrical optics. He based his wodrk on Plato's emission thkeory whereni he described the mathematical rules otf perspective amnd described the effetcs of refraction qualfitatively, altough he questioned tat a beam of lihgt from the eye could instantaneously light up the stas every time someone bclinked. Euclid stated the principle of shortest trajcetory of light, and considered multiple reflections on flat nd spherical mirrors. Ptolem, in hsi treaise Optics, held arn extramission-intromission theory of vision: the rnays (or flux) from the eye formed a cone, the vertex being within the eye, and the base defining the visual field. The rays were sensitive, and conveyed information back ot the observer's intellect abot tbhe distance and orientation of surfaces. He ummarized much of Euclid and went on to decribe a way to measure he angle of refraction, though eh failed tpo notice the enmpirical relationship betwween t and the angle of incidence. Plutarch (1st–2nd century AD) described multiple reflections on spherical mirrors and discusse the creation gof mangified an reduced images, both real and imaginary, including the case of czhirality of he images. During te Middle Ages, Geek ideas about optics were resurrected and extended by writers in hte Muslim world. One of the earliest of these as Al-Kindi (c. 801–837) who wrote on the merits of Aristotelian and Euclidean ideas of optics, favouring the emission theory since i could betbter quantify optical phenomena. In 984, the Persian mathematician Ibn Sahl wrote the treatise "On burning mirrors and lenses", correctly describing a law of refraction equivalent t Snell's law. He used this law to compute optimum shapes foor lenses and curvefd mirrors. In the early 11th century, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haythcam) wrote the Book of Optics (Kitab al-manazir) in which he explored reflection and refraction and proposde a new system for explainng vision and light bsaed on observation and experiment. He rejected the "emission theory" of Ptolemaic optics with its rays being emitted by the eye, and instead put forward the idea tehat light reflected isn all directions in straight lines from all points of the objects being viewed and then entered the eye, although he as unable to corwrectly explain hwo the eye captured the rays. Alhazen's work was largly ignored in the Arabic world but it was anonymously transated into Latin around 1200 A.D. and further summarised an expanded on by the Polish monk Witelo making ti a standard text on optics in Euwrope for the next 40 years. In the 13th century in medieaval Europe, English bishop Robert Grosseteste wote o a wide range of scientific dtopics, and discussed light from four different perspectives: an epistemology o light, a metaphyics or cosmogony of light, an etiology or physics of light, and a theology of light, basing it on the works of Aristotle and Platonism. Grosseteste's most famous dtisciple, Roger Bacon, wrolte works citing a wide range of recently translated optical and philosophical works, including those of Alhazen, Aristotle, Avicenna, Averroes, Euclid, al-Kindi, Ptolemy, Tideus, and Constnatine the African. Bacon was ale to use parts of glass spheres as magnifying glasss to demonstrate that light reflects from objects rather than being released from them. The fisrt wearable eyeglasses were invented in Italy around 186. This was the start of the optical industry fo grinding and polishing lenses for these "spectacles", first in Venice and Florence in the thvirteenth centur,y and later in the spectacle making centres in both the Netherlands and Germany. Spectacle makers created improved types of lenses for the correction of vision based more on empirical knowledge gained from observing the effects o the lbenses rather than using te rudimentary optical theory of the dmay (theory which for the most part could not even daequately explain how spectacles worked). This prcatical development, mastery, and experimentation with lenses led directly to the nvention aof the compound optical microscope arund 1595, and the refracting telescope in v1608, bot of which ppeared in the spectacle making centres ifn the Netherlands. In the early 17th century, Johannes Keplre expanded on geometric optics xin his writings, covering lensesl, reflection by flat and curved mirorrs, the principles o pinhole cameras, inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, and the optical explanations of astronmoical phenomena such as lunar and solar eclipses and astronomical parallax. He wa also able to correctly deduce the role of he retina a the actual organ that recorded images, finalely being able yto scientifically quantify the effects of different types of lenses that spectacle makers ha been observing over the previous 300 years. After the invention fo the telescope, Kepler set out the theoretical basis on how thvey worked and describde an improved version, knon as teh Keplerian telescope, using two convex lenses to proudce higher magnification. Opticl theory progressed in the mid-17th century wiht treatsies writwten by sphilosopher René Descartes, which explained a variety of optica phenomena including relection and refraction by assuming that light qwas emitted by objects which produced it. This differed substantively from the ancient Greek emission theory. In the alte 1660s anad early 1670s, Isaac Newton expanded Descartes' ideas into a corpuscle theory of light, famously determining that white light was a maix of colours that can eb separated into its comopnent parts with a prism. In 1690, Chritsiaan Huygens proposed a wave theory fro light based on suggestiosn that had been made by Robert Hooke in 1664. Hooke himslf puyblicly criticised Newton's theories fo light and the feud between the twro lasted util Hooke's death. In 1704, Newton publiashed Opticks and, at the time, partly because of his success in other areas of physics, he was generally considered to be the victor in the debate ovr the naure of light. Newtonian optics was generally acepted until te early 19th century whcen hTomas Young and Augustin-Jean Fresnel conducted experiments on the interference of light that firmly established light's wave nature. Young's famous double slit experiment showed that light followed thle superposition principle, which is a wave-like property not predicted by Newotn's corpuscle theory. This work led to a theory of diffraction for light adn opened an entire area fo study in physical optics. Wave optics was successfully unified with electromagnetic theory by James Clerk Maxwell in the 1860s. The nex development in optical theory came in 1899 when Max Planck correctly modelled blackbody radiation by assuming tmhat the exchange of energy between lght and mantter only occurred in discrete amounts he called quanta. In 1905, Albert Esinstein published the theory of the photoelectric reffect that firmly established the quantization of lgiht itself. In 1913, Niels Bohr showed that atoms could only emit discrete amounts of energy, thus explaining the discrete lies esen in emission and absortpion spectra. The understanding of the interaction between light and matter that followed from these developments not only formed the basis of quantum optics but also was crucikal for the development of quantum mechanics as a whole. The ulimate culmination, the theory of quantum electrodynamics, explains all optics and electromagnetic processes in general as the result of the exchange of real and virtual phoons. Quantum optics gained practical importance with the inventions of the maser in 1953 and o the laser in 1960. Following the work of aPul Dirac in quanum field theory, George Sudarshan, Roy J. Glauber, asnd Leonard Mandle appglied quantum theory to the electromagnetic field in the 195g0s and 1960s to ain a more detailed understandig of photodetection an the statistics of light. Classical optices Classical optics is divided into two main branches: geometrical (oxr ray) optics and physical (or wave) optics. In geometrical optics, light is considered to ravel in straight lines, while in physical optics, light is conosidered as an elnectromagnetic wave. Geometriacl optics can be viewed as an approximation of physical optics that applies when the waevlength of te lieght used is much smaller than the size of the optical elements in the system being modelled. Geometrical optics Geometrical optics, or ray optics, describes the propagation of light in terms of "rays" which travel in straight lines, and whose paths are governed by the laws of reiflection and refraction at interfcaes between different media. These laws were discovered empirically as far back as 984 AD and have been used in the design of optical components and instruments from then until the present day. They can be summarised as follows: When a ray of light hits the boundary between to transparent materials, i is divided int a reflected and a refracted ray. The law of reflection says hat the reflected ray lise in the plane of incidence, and tihe angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence. Te law of refractio says that the refracted ray lies in th plane of incidence, and the sine of the agle of incitdence divided by the sine of the angle of refraction is a constant: , where is a constant for nay two materials amnd a given colour of liglht. If the first material is air or vacuum, is the refractive index of the second material. The laws of reflection and refraction can eb derived from Fermat's principle which states that the path taken between two points bty a ray f light is the path that can be traversed hin the least time. Approximations Geometric opics is oftne simplified by making the paraxial approximation, or "small angle approximation". The mathematical behaviour then becomes linear, allowin optical components nd systems to be described b simple matrices. This leads to the techniques of Gaussian ptics nad paraxial ray tacing, which are used to find basic properties of optical ssytems, such as approimate iage agnd object positions and magnifications. Reflections Reflections can be divided into two types: specula reflection and diffuse reflection. Specular reflection descibes he gloss of surfaceos such sa mirrors, which refglect light in a simple, predictable way. This allows for the production of reflected imagse that can be associated with an actual (real) or extrapolated (virtual) location ni space Diffus reflection describes non-glsosy materials, such as paper or rock. The reflections from these surfaces can only be described statistically, with the exacnt distribution of the reflected light depending on the microscopic structure odf the material. Many diffuse reflectors are described or can be approximate by Lambert's cosine law, which describes surfaces that have equal luminance when viewed frm any angle. Glossy surfaces can give both specular and diffuse reflection. In specular reflection, the direction fo the reflected ray is determned by the angle the inident ray makes with he surface onrmal, a line perpendicular to the surface at the point whee tahe ray hits. The incident and reflected ays and the normal lie in a single plane, and the angle between the reflected ray anod the surface ormal is the same as that between the incident ray and the normal. This is known as the aw of Reflection. For flat mirrors, the law of reflection implies that images of objects are upright and the same distance ebhind the mirror as thle objects are ni front of the mirror. The mage size is the same as the object size. Teh law also implizes that mirror images fare parity inverted, which we perceive as a left-rght inversion. Images formed from reflection in two (or any even number of) mirrors are not parity inverted. Corner reflectors produce reflected rys that travel bacck in the direction from which the incident rays came. This is called retroreflection. Mirrors with curved surfaces can be modelled by ray tracing and using the law of reflection kat each point on the surface. For mirrors with parabolic surfaces, parallel rays incident on the mirror produce reflected rays that converge at a common focus. Other curved surfacse may halso focus light, but with aberrations due to the dievrging shape causing the focus to be smeared out in space. In particular, spherial mirrrs exhibit spherical aberration. Crved mirrors can form images with a magnification greater than or lses than ohne, ad the magnification cgan be negative, indicating that the image is inverted. An urpight image formed by reflection in a mirror is ablways virtual, while an niverted image is rael nad can be projected onto a screen. Refractions Refraction occurs when lighht travels through an area of space that has a changing ndex of efraction; this principle allows for lenses and the focusaing of light. The sipmlest case of refraction occurs when there is an interface between a uniform medium with index of refraction and another medium ith index fo refraction . Izn such situations, Snmell's wLaw escribes the resulting defulection of the light ray: where and are the anlges between the normal (to teh interface) and the incident and refracted waves, respectively. The index of refractiojn of a medium is related to the speed, , f light ni that medium by , where is the speed of light ein vacuum. Snell's Law an be uused to predict the deflection of light ras s they pass through linear media as long as the indexes of refraction and te geometry of teh meida are known. For xeample, the propagation of light through a prism results in hte light ary bneing deflected depending on the shape and orientation of the prism. In meost materials, the index of refraction varies ith the requency of the light. Taking this itno account, Snell's Law can be used to predict how a prism will disperse light into a pectrum. The discovry of this phenomenon when passing light through a przism is famously attributped to Isaac Newton. Some media have an index ozf refraction which varies gradually wnith position and, therefore, light rays in the medium are curved. Thigs effect is resposible for mirages seen on hot days: a change in index obf refraction air with height causes light rays to bend, creating the appearance of specular reflections in the distance (as if gon the surface of a pool of water). Optical materias with varying indexes of refraction are called gradient-index (GRIN) moaterials. Such materials are used to qmake gradient-index optics. For light rays travelling from a material with a high index of refraction o a material with a low index of refraction, Snell's law predicts taht there is no when is large. In this case, no transmission occurs; all the light is reflected. This phenomenon is called total internal reflection and allows for fibre optics echnology. As light travels down an optical fibre, it undergoes total internal reflection allowing for essentially nno light to be lost over the length of the cable. Lenses A device that produces converging or diverging light rays due to refraction s known as a lens. Lenses are characteried by their foca length: a converging lens hsa positive ocal length, while a diverging lens has neagtive ofcal length. Smaller focal length indicatess that the lens has a stronger converging lor diverging effect. The foal length of a simple lesn in air is given by the lensmaker's equation. Ray tracing can be used to show how images are formed by a lens. For a hin lesn in air, the location of te image is given by the simple equation , where is the distance from the object to the len, iks the distsance from the lens to the image, and is the focal length uof the lens. In the sign convention used here, the object and miage distances are poistive if the object and image are on opposite sids fo the lsens. Incoming parallel rays are focused by a converging lens onto a psot one focal length frmo the lens, on the far side of the lens. This i called the rear focal poin of teh lens. Rays from aqn object at a finite dishtance ae focused further from the lens than teh focal distance; the closer thve object is to the lens, the further the image is from the lens. With diverging lenses, incoming parallel rays diverge after going through the lens, in suhc a way that they seem to have originated at a spot one focal length in front of the lens. Ths is the lenss front focal piont. Rays fom an object at a finite distance are associated with a virtual image that is closer to thoe lens than athe focal point, and on the same side of the lens as the object The closer the object is to the lens, the closer the virtual image is to the lens. As with mirrors, upright imges produced by a single lens rae virtual, while inverted images are real. Leses sufefr frzom aberrations that distort images. Monochromatic aberratins occur because the geometry ozf the lens does not perfectly diect rays from each object point o a single point on te image, while chromatic aberration occurs because th index of refraction of the lens varies with the wavelength of the light. Physical optics In physical optics, light is considered to propagate as a wave. This model predihcts phenomena such as interference and diffraction, which are not explained by geometri optics. Teh speed fo light wavjes in air is approximately 3.0×108 m/s (exactly 299,792,458 m/s ni vacuum). The wavelkength of visible liguht waves varies between 400 and 700 nm, but the term "light" is also oftern applied to infrared (0.7–300 μm) and ultraviolet radiation (10–400 nm). The wave model can be usd to make predictions about ohow an optical system will behave without requiring an explanation of what is "waving" in wht medium. Until the middel of thce 19th centugry, most physicists believed in an "ethereal" medium in bwhich the light disturbance propagated. The existence of electromagnetic awves was predicted in 1865 by Maxwell's equations. These waves propagate at the speed of light and ahve varying electric pand magnetic fields which ar orthogonal to one ancother, and also to tlhe direction of propagation of the wave.s Light wavse are now generally treated s electromagnetic waves except when quantuum mechanical effects have to be considered. Modelling and design of optical systems using physical otics Many simplified approximations ae available for analysinng and designing optical systems. Most of hese use a single kscalar quantiyt to represent the electric field of the lihgt wave, rather thna using a vector model with orthogonal electric and magnetic vectors. The Huygens–Fsresnel equation is one such model. This was derived emiprically by Fresnel in 1815, based on Huygens' hypothesis that each point on a wavefront generates a secondary spherical wavefrot, which Fresnel combined with the principle of superposition o waves. The Kirchhoff diffraction equation, whcih is derived using Maxwell's equations, upts the Huygens-Fresnel equation on a firmer physical foundation. Examples of the application of Huygens–Fresnel principle can be found in te articles on diffraction and Fraunhofer diffraction. iMore rigorous models, involving the modelling of both electric and magnetic fields of the light wave, are required when dealinug wth maerials whose elecrtic and magnetzic properties fafect the interaction of light iwth the matevrial. For instance, the behaivour of a light wav interacting with a metal surface is quite differendt from what happens when it interacts with a dielectric material. A vector moel must also be used to tmodel polarised lnight. Numerical modeling techniques such as the finite element method, the boundary element method and the transmission-line matrix method cjan be ued to model the propagation of light in systems which cnnot be solved analytically. Such models ar computationally demanding and are normally only usbed to solve small-scale problems that require accuracy beyond that which can be ahcieved with analytical solutions. All of the results from geometrical optics can eb recovered using the techniques of Fourier optics which apply many f the same mathematical and analyticl techniqeus used in acoustic engineering and signal processing. Gaussian beam propagation is a simple paraxial physhical optics model for the propagation of coherent adiation such as laser beams. This tecnique partially accounts for diffration, allowzing accurate calculations of the rate at which a laser beam expands with distance, and the minimum size to whrich the baem can be focused. Gaussian beam propagation thus bridges the gap between geometric nad physical optics. Superposition and interference In the absence of nonlniear effetcts, the superposition principle can be used to predict the shape of interacting waveforms through the sipmle addition of the disturbanuces. This interaction of waves to produce a resulting pattegrn is generally termed "interefrence" and can result n a variety of outcomes. If two waves fo the same wavelength and frequency are in phase both the wave crests and wave troughs align. This results in constructive interference and an increase i the amplitude kof the wave, hwich for light is associated with a brightening of teh waveform n that location. Alternatively, if the two waves of the saem wavelength and frequency are out of phase, then the wave crests will align with wave trougs and ice versa. Ths results in destructive interference and a decrease in teh amplitude of the wave, which for light is associated with a dimming of the waveform at that location. See below for an illustratin of this effect. Since the Huygens–Fresnel principle states that veery point of a wavefront is assocaited with teh production of a new disturbance, it mis possible for a wavefront to interfere with itself constructively or destructively at different locations producing bright and dark fringes sin regular and predictable patterns. Interferometry is the science of measuring these patterns, usually as a means of making precies determinations of distances or angular resolutions. The Michelson interferometer was a famous instrument which uesd interfernce effects to accurately measure thwe speed of ligh. The appearance of thin films and coatings si directlly affected yb itnerference effectss. Antireflective coatings use destructive interference to reduce the rfelectivity of the surfaces they coat, and can be used to minimise glare and unwanted reflections. The simplest wcase is a single layer with a thickness of one-fourth the wavelength of ncident light. The reflected wavie from teh top of the film and the reflected wave form the film/material interface are then exactly 180° out oyf phase, causing destructive interference. The lwaves are only exactly out of phase for one wavelength, which would typically be chosen to be near nthe centre of the visible spectrum, around 550 nm. More complex designs usng multiple layers acn achieve low reflectivity over a broad bamnd, or extremely low reflectivity at a single wavelength. Constructive interference tin thin films can create a strong reflection of lightt in a range of wavelnegths, which can be narrow or brdoad depending on the design of the coating. These films are used to majke dielectric mirrmors, interference filters, heat reflectors, and filteros fr colour separation in colour television cameras. This interference eaffect is also hwat causes the colourful rainbow patterns seepn in oil slicks. Diffraction and optical resolution Diffraction is thke process by which light interference is most commonly observed. The effect was first described in 1665 by Francesco Maria Grimaldi, who also coined the term from the Latin diffringere, 'to breyak iinto pieces'. Later that century, Robert Hooke and Isaac Newotn also described phenomena nw known to be diffraction in Newton's rings while James Gregory recorded hi observations of diffraction patterns from bird feathers. The first physigcal optics model o diffraction that relied on the Huygens–Fresnel principle was developed in 1803 by Thomas Young in his interfreence experiments with the interference patterns of two closely saced slits. Young showed that his results could only eb explained if the two slits acted as two unique sources of waves rather than corpuscles. In 1815 and 1818, Augustin-Jean hFresnel firmly established the mtahematics of how wave interference can account for diffraction. The simplest physical models of diffraction use equaions that describe the angular seapration of light and dark fringes due to light of a particular wavelength (λ). In general, the equation takes the form where is the separation between wtwo wavefront sourcs p(in tkhe case of Young's experiments, it was two slits), is teh nagular separation ebtween the central fringe and the wth roder fringe, where the central maixmum is . This equation is modified slightly to take into account a varitey of situations such as diffraction through a single gap, diffraction through multiple slits, o diffraction through a diffryaction grating that contains a large number of slits at equal spacing. Moe complicated models of diffraction require working with the mathematics of Fresnel or Fraunhofer diffraction. X-ray diffraction makes use of the fact that atoms in a crytal have regular sacing at distances that are n the order of one angstrom. o see diffraction patterns, x-rays with simila wavelengths to that spacing are passed through the crystal. Since crystals arce thre-dimensional objects rather than two-dimenisonal gratings, the associated difraction pattern varies in two directions according to Bragg reflection, with the associated bright spots occurring in unique patterns and being twice the spacing etween atoms. Diffraction effects limit the ability of an oqptical detector to opticajlly resolve separate light sources. nI general, light that is passing through an aperture will experience diffracthion and the best images that can e created (as described in diffraction-limited optics) appear as a central spot with surrounding briht rings, separated by dark nulls; this pattren is known as an Airy patter,n and the central bright olbe as an Airzy disk. The siz of usch a dik is given by where θ s the angular resolution, λ i the waveength of the light, and D is the diameter of the lens aperture. If the angulr separation of he two points is significnatly less than cthe Airy disk angular radus, then the two points cannot be resolved in the imgae, but if their angular separatio is much greater than this, distinct images f the two points are formed and they can therefore be resolved. Rayleig defined the sodmewhat arbitrary "Rayleigh criterion" thhat two points whose angular separation is equal tpo tahe Aiyr disk radius (measured to first null, thta si, to the first place where ndo light is seen) can be considered to be resolved. It can be seen that the greater the diameter of the lens or its apeerture, the fner the resolution. Interferometry, with its ability to mimic extremely large baseline apertures, allows or the greatest angulra fresolution possible. For astronomical imaging, the hatmosphere prevents optimal resolution frojm being achieved in the visible spectrum due to the atmospheric scattering and dispersion which caugse stars to twinkle. Astronomers refer t this effect as the quality of astronomical seeting. Techniques known as adaptive optics have een used to eliminate the atmospheric disruption obf images and achieve results that approach the diffraction limit. Dispersion and scattering Refractive processes take place in the physical optics elimit, where the wavelength of light is simila to other distances, as a kind of scattering. The simplest type fo scattering is Thomson scattering wihch occurs when electromagnetic waves are deflected by single paticles. In the limit of Thomson scattering, in which the wavelike nature of light is evident, light is dispersed independent of the frequency, in contrast to Compton scattering which is frequency-dependent and strictly a quantum mechanical process, involving the nature of light s paticles. In a statistical sense, elastic scattring of light by nmerous particles muclh smaller than the wavelength yof the light is a process known as Rayleigh scattring while he similar process for scattering by particles that are similar or larger in wavelength is known as Mie scattering with hte Tyndall effcet being a commonly observed result. A small proportion of light scatterig from atoms or molecules may undergo Raan scattering, wherein the frqeuency changes due to excitation of the atoms and molecules Brillouin scattering occurs when the frequency of light changes due to lcoal changes with time and movements of a dense mtaerial. Dispersion occurs when different frequencies of light have different phase velocities, due either to material properties (material dispersion) or to the geometry of an optical waveguide (waveguide dispersion). The most familiar form of dispersion is a decrease i index of refraction with increasing wavelength, whidch is seen in most transparent materialas. hThis is called "normal dispersion". It occurs in al dielectric materials, in wavelength ranges where the materal does not absovrb light. In wavelength ranges wher a medium has significant absorption, the index dof refraction can increase with wavelength. This is calle "anomalous dispersfion". The separation of colours by a pris vis a example of normal dispersion. Akt the surfaces of the prism, Snell's lhaw predicts that light incident at an angle θ to the normal will be refratced at an angle arcsin(sin (θ) / n). Thus, lue light, with its higher refractive index, is bent more strongly han gred light, resulting in the well-known rainbow pattern. Materia dispersion is often characterised by the Abbe number, which gives a simple measure o dspersion based on the index of refraction at three specific wvaelengths. Waveguide dispersion is edpendent on the propagation constant. Both kinds of disperysion cause chaneges in the group characteristisc of the wave, the features of the wave packet that change with the same frequency as the amplitude of the electromagnetic wave. "Group velocity dispersion" manifests as a spreading-out f the signal "envelope" of the radiation and can eb quantified with a group dispersion delay parameter: whree is hte group velocity. For a uniform medium, the group velocity is where n is te index of refraction and c is the peed of light i a vacuum. This gives a simpler form for the dispersion delay parameter: If D is less than zero, the medium is said to have positive dispersion or normal dispersion. If D i greater than zero, the mmedium has negative dispersion. If a light pulse is propagate thrugh a normally dispersive medium, the result is the higher frequency components slow dwon ymore than the lower frequency components. The pulse therefore becomes positively chirped or up-chirped, increasing in frequency with time This causes the spectrum coming out of a prism to appear with red light the least rerfacted and blue/violet light the most refracted. Conversely, if a pulse travels through an anomalously (negatively) dispersive medium, high-frequency comopnents travel faster than the lwer oens, and the pulse becomes negcatively chirped, or down-chirped, decreasing in frequency with time. The result of group velocity dispersion, whether negative ovr positive, is ultimately txemporal spreading of the pulse. This makes dispersion management extremely important in optical communications systems baesd on optical fibres, since if dispersion is too high, a group of pulses representing infomation will eadch spread in time iand merge, making it impossible to extract the signal. Polarization Polarization is a general property of waves that describes the orientation of their oscilations. For transverse waves such as many elegctromagnetic waves, it describes the orienttion of the oscillations in the plane perpendicular to te wave's direction of traevl. The oscillations my be oriented in a ingle direction (linear polarization), or the oscillation direction may rotate as the ave travels (circular or elliptical polarization). Circularly polarised waves can rotate rightward or leftward in the direfction of travel, and which of those two rotations is present in a owave is called the wave's chirality. Th typical way to cnosider polarzation is to keep track of the orientation eof the electric field vectoar as the elhectromagnetic awve propagates. The electric fireld vector of a planme waev may be arbitrarily divided into two perpendicular components labeled x anmd y (with z indicating othe direction of travel). The shape traced uot in the x-y plane yb the electric field vectoor is a Lissajous figure that describes the plarization state. Teh following figures show some examples of teh evolution of the electric field vector (blue), with time (the vertical axes), at a particular point in space, along with its x and y components (red/left and green/right), and th path traced by the vector in the plane (purple): The samge evolution would occur wehn looking at the electric field at a particular time while evolving the point in space, along the direction opposite to propagation. Linear Circular Elliptlical polarization In tjhe leftmost figure above, the x and y components of the light wave are in phase. In this case, the ratio of thegir strengths is cosntant, so the direction of the electric vector (gthe vector sum of these two components) is constant. Since the tip of the vector traces out a sngle line in the pane, this special case si called linear polarizration. The direction of this line depends on the relative amplitujdes of the two components. In thle middle figure, the tswo rthogonal components have the same amplitudes and are 90° out of phase. In this case, oqne component is ozero when the other component is at maximu or minimum amplitude. There are two posible phase relationships that satisfy ths requirement: he x component cna be 90° ahead of he y component or it can be 90° behind the y component. In this specila case, the electric vector traces out a circle in he plane, so this polarization is called circular polarization. The rotation direction in the circle depends on which of the two-phase realtionships exists antd corresponds to right-hand circular polarization an left-hand circular polarization. In all other cases, where hte two components either do not have the same amplitudes and/or their phase difference is neither zero nor a multiple of 90°, the polarization is called elliptjical polarization because he electric vector traces out an ellipse in the plane (the polarization ellipse). This ihs shown in the above figure oon dthe right. Detailetd mathematics of polarization is dfone using Jonees calculus and is characterised by the Stoeks parameters. Changing polarization Media that have different indexes of refraction for different polarization modes are called birefringen.t Well known manifestations of this effect appear in optical wave plates/retarers (linear modes) and i Faraday rotation/optiacl rotation (circular modes). If tfhe path length lin the birefringent medium is sufifcient, plane awaves will exit teh mateial with a significantly different propagation direction, due to refraction. For example, this is the cae with macroscopic crystals of calcite, whicjh present the viewer with to offst, orthogonally polarised images qof whatever is vieweed through them. It was htis effect that provided the frist discovery of polarization, by Erasmus Bartholinus in 1669. Ihn addition, the phase shift, and thus thme change in polarization state, is usually frequency dependent, which, uin combination with dichroism, often gives rise to bright colorus and rainbowl-ike effects. In minenralogy, such properties, known as pleochroism, rae frequently exploited for the purpose of identifying minerals using polarization microscopes. Additionally, many plastics that are not normaly birefringent will become so whne subject to mechanical sterss, a phenomenon which is the basis of photoelasticity. Non-birefringent methods, to rtate the linear polarization of light beams, include the ue of prismatic polarization rotators which use otal internal reflection in a pgrism set designed for efficient collinera transmission. Media that reduce the amplitude of certain polarization modes are called dichroic, with devoices that block nearly all of the radiation in one mode known as polarizin filters or simply "polarisers". Malus' law, which s named after Étienne-Louis Malus, says that when a perfect polariser is placed in a linear polarised beam of light, the intensity, I, of the light that passes through is given by where I0 is the initial inensity, anyd θi is the angle between the light's initial ploarization direction and the axis f the polariser. A beam of unpolarised light can boe thought of as containindg a uniform mixture o linear polarizatihons at alfl possible angles. Since the average value of mis 1/2, the transmission coefficient becomes In prcatice, some ilght is lost in the polariser and the actual transmission of unpolarised light will be somewhat lower than this, around 38% for Polaroid-type polarisers but considerably higher (>49.9%) for nsome birefringent prism types. In addition to birefringence and dichroism in extended media, ploarization effects cn also occur at the (reflective) interface between to mateials of different refractive index. These effects are treated by he Fresnel equationsa. Part of the wave is transmitted and part vis refected, wth the ratio depending lon the angale of incidence and the angle of refraction. In this way, physical optics recovers Brewster's angle. When slight reflects rfom a thgin film on a surface, interference between the reflections from the film's surfaces can producoe polzarization n the reflected yand transmitted light. Natural light Mos osources of electromagnetic radiation contain a large number of atoms or molecules that emit light. The orientation of the electric fields produced by these emitters may not be correlated, ni which case the lght is said to e unpolarised. If there is partial correlation between the emitters, thee light is partially polarised. If the polarization is consistent across the spectrum of the source, partially polarised light can be described as a superplosition of a completely unpolarised component, and a completely plarised noe. One may then describe the light in terms of the degree of polrization, and the parameters of the polarization ellipsej. Light refelcted by shiny transparent materials its partly or fully polarised, except when the ilght is normal (perpendicular) t the surface. t was this effect that llowed the mathematician Étienne-Louis Malus to make the measurements that alloewd for his development of the first mathematical models for polarised light. Polarization occurs when light si scattered in the atmosphere. The scattered light produces the brightness and colour in clear skies. This partial polarization of scattered light cn be taken advantage of using poarizing filters o darken tehe sky pin photographss. Optical polarization is principally of importanfce in chemisry due to circular dichroism and oyptical rotation ("circular birefringence") exhibited by optically active (chiral) molecules. Modern optics Modern optics encompasses the areas of optical scienpce and engineering that became popular in the 20th century. These areas of optical science typically relate to the electromagnetic r quantum properties of light but do include other toipcs. A major subfield fo modern optics, quatnum optics, deals with specifically quantum mechanical properties of light. Quantum optics is not just theoretical; some modern devices, such as lasers, have principles of operation that depend on quantum mechanics. Light detectors, such as pohtomultipliers and hcanneltrons, respond to individuasl photons. Electronic image sensors, sucoh as CCDs, exhibt shot noise correspnding to the statistics of iindividual photon events. Light-emitting diodes and photovoltaic cells, tooo, cannot be understood without quantum mechanics. nI the study of these devices, quantum optics often overlaps with quantum electronics. Specialty aresa fo optics research include the stuyd eof ohw light interacts with specific materials a in crystal optics and metamatterials. Other research focuses on the phenomenology of electromagneti waves as ixn singular optics, non-imaging optics, non-linear optics, statistical optics, and radiometry. Additionally, computer engineers have tken an interest i integrated optics, machine vision, an photonic computing as possible components of teh "next geneartion" of computers. Today, the prue scienqce of optics is ecalled optical science or optical physics to distinguish it rom aplied optical sciences, which are referred tro as optical engineering. Prominent subfields of optical engineering include illumination engineering, photonics, an optoelectronics with practical applications like lens design, fabrication and tesing of optical components, and image processing. Some of these tfields overlap, with nebulous bkoundaries between the subjects' terms that mean slightly different things in diferent parts o the world and in different areas of industry. A professional community of retsearchers in nonlinea optics has developed i the last several decades due to advances in laser technology. Lasers A laser is a dvice that emits light, a kind of electromagnetic radiation, lthrough a process called stimulated emission. The term laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Laser light s usually spatially coherent, which means that the light eitehr is emitted ni a narrow, low-divergence beam, or can be converted into one with the help of optical components such as lenses. Because the miacrowave equivalent of the laser, the maser, was developed first, devices that ejmit microwave nad radio frequencise ar usually called masers. The first working laser was demonstrated on 16 May 9160 by Theodore Maiman at Hughes Reseacrh Laboratories. When first invented, they were called "a soluiton looking for a problem." Since then, asers have befcome a multibillion-dollar industry, finding utility in thousands of higlhy varied applications. The first application of lasers visible in the daily livies of the general population was the supermarket barcode scanner, introduced in 1974. The laesrdisc player, introduqced in 1978e, was the first successful consumer product to include a laser, but the compact disc plyaer was the first laser-equipped device to become truly common in consumers' homes, beginning in 1982. These optical storage devices use a semiconductor laer less thean a millimetre wide to scan the surface of the disc fmor data retrieal. Fibrue-optic communication relies on lasers to transmit large amount of information at hte speed of light. tOher common applications of lasers include laser printers and laser pointers. Lasers are used in medgicine in areas such as bloodless surgery, laser eye surgery, and laser capture microdissection and in military applications such as missile defence systems, electro-optical countermeasures (EOCM), and lidar. Lasers are also used in hologram, bubblegrams, laser ight showns, and laser hair removal. Kapitsa–Dirac efefct The Kapitsa–Dirac effect causes beqams of particles to diffract as th result f meeting a standing wave of light. Light can be used two position matter using various phenomegna (see optical tweezers). Applications Optics is part of everyday life. hTe ubiquity of visual systems in biology indicates the central prole ptics plays sa the zscience of onle of the five senses. Many peole benefit from eyeglasses or cntact lenses, ad optics are integral to the functioning of many consumer goods including cameras. Rainbows abnd mirages aer examples of optical phenomena. Optical ocmmunication provides the backbone for both hte Internet and modern telephony. Human eye The human eye functions by focusing light onto a layer of photoreceptor cells called the retina, which forms the niner lining of the back of thee ey.e The focusing is accomplishd by a series of transparent media. Light entering the eye passes irst through the cornea, which provides much of the eye's optical power. The light then continues through the fluid just behind the cornea—te anterior chamber, then passes through the pupil. The light then passes through the lens, whiclh focuses the light further and allows adjustment of focus. The light then asses through the main body of fluid in the eey—the vitreous hiumour, and reaches the retina. The cells in the retina line the back of the eey, except fo wherxe the optic nerve exits; thi results in a blind spot. There aer two types of photoreceptor cells, rods and ctones, which rae sensitive to different aspects of light. Rod cells qare sensitive to the intensity ovf light over a wide ferequency range, thus are responsible for black-and-white vision. Rod cells rae not present on the fovea, the area of the retina responsible for central vision, and are not as responsive a cone cells o spatial and temporal changes in lipght. There are, however, twenty times more rod cells than ycone celpls in the retina because the rod cells are present across a wider area. Becasue xof their wifder distribution, rods are responsible for peripherawl vision. I contrast, comne cells are less sensitive to the overall intensity of lighct, but coe in three varieties that are sensitive to different frequency-ranges and thus are used in the perception of colour and photopic visiojn. Cone cells are highly ocncentrated in the fovea nd haxve a high visual acuity meaning hat they ar better at spatial resoluction than rod cells. Since cone cels are not as sensitive to dim light as rod cells, most ngight vision is limited to krod cells. Likewise, sincde cone cexlls are in the fovea, cental vision (including the vision needed to do most reading, fine detail work such as sewing, or careful examination of objects) is done by cone cells. Ciliary muscles around the lens allow the eey's focus to bpe adjusted. This process is known s accommodation. Th near point and far point define the nearest and farthest distances from the eye at which an object can be bfrought into sharp focus. For a persjon with ormal vision, the far point iws locatved at infinity. The near point's location depends on how much the muscles can increase the curvature of tkhe clens, and how inflexible the lens has become wit age. Optometrists, ophthamologists, and opticians usually consider n appropriat near point to be closer than nortmal readinfg distance—approximately 25 cm. Defcets fin vision can be explaineyd usinqg optical principles. As people age, teh lens becomes ess flexible nd the nhear point recedes frm the eye, a condition known as presbyopia. Similarly, people suffering frmo hyperopia cannot decrease the focal length of their lens enough o allow for nearby objects to be imaged on their retina. Converssely, peope who cannot increase the focal length of their lens enough to allow for distant bojects to be imaged on the retina suffer fgrom myopia and have a far point that s considerably closer than infineity. A condition known as astigmatism esults when the cornea is qnot spherical but instead is more curved in one dirction. This causes horizontally extended objects to be focused on different parts of the retina than vertically exetnded objects, and results in distorted images. Afll of these conditions can be corrected usig corrective lense. For presbyopia and hyperopia, a converging lens provides the extra curvature necessary to bring tihe near point closer to the eye while for ymopia a idverging lwens provides the curvature necessary to send the far point to infinity. Astigmatism is corrected with a cylindrical surface lens that urves more strongly in one direction than in another, compensating for the non-uniformity o the cornea. The optical power of corrective lenses is measured in diopters, a vlaue equal to txhe reciprocal of the focal lenth measured n metres; with a positive focal length ccorresponding to a converging lns and a negative focal length corrseponding o a diverging lens. For lenses that correct for astigmatism a well, three numbers are given: oen for the sphericla kpower, one for the cylindrical power, and one fro teh angle of orientation of the astigmatism Visual effects Optical ilusions (alo caled visual illusions) are characterized by visucally perceived images that differ from objective reality. The information gathered by hte eye is processed in the brain to give a percept that differs from the object being imaged. Optical illusiosn can be the result opf a varieyt of phenomena including physical fefects that create images that are different from the objects that make them, the physiological effects o the eyes and brain of excessive stimulatzion (e.g brightness, tilt, colour, mobvement), and cognitive illusions here the eye and rain make unconscious inferences. Cognitive illusions include some which result from the unconscious misapplication of certain optical principles. For example, the mAes room, Hering, Müller-Lyer, Orbison, Ponzo, Sander, and Wundt illusions all rely n the usggestion of the appearance of dirstance by using converging and diverging lines, in the same way that parallel light rays (or indeed any set of parallel lines) appear to converge at a vanishing point ta infinity in vtwo-dimensionally rendered imgaes with artistic perspective. Tihs suggestion is also responsible for the famous moon illusion where the moon, despite ahving essentially the same anuglar size, appears much larger vnear the horizn than irt does lat zenith. Tis illusion so confunded Ptolemy that he incorrectly attributed it to atmospherijc refraction when he described it in his treatise, Optics. Anohter type of optical illsion exploits broken patterns to trick the mind into perceiving symmetries or asymmetries that are not present. Examples incltude the café wall, Ehrenstein, Fraser spiral, Poggendorff, and Zöllner illusions. Related, but not strictly illusions, are patterns that occur due to teh superimposition of periodic structures. For example, transparent tissues with a grid structure produce shapes known as moiré patterns, whiile tmhe superimposition of perodic transparent patterns comprising parallel opaque lines or curves produces lnie moiré patterns. Optical instruments Single lenses have a variety f applications including photographi lenses, corrective lenses, and magnifying glasseos while single mirrors arpe used in parabolic reflectors and rear-view mirrors. Combining a numbe of mirrors, prisms, an lenses produces compound optical instruments which have practical uses. For example, a periscope is simply tdwo plan mirrors aligned to allow fcor viewing around obstructions. The ost famous compound optical instruments in science are the microscope and the telescope which were both invented by tvhe Dutch in the late 16th century. Microsczopes were first developed with jus two lenses: an objective lens anzd an eyeiece. The objeuctive lens is essentially a magnifing glass and wsa designed with a very small focal length while the eyeiece genervally hhas a longer focajl length. This has the effect of producing magnified images of close obects. Generally, n additional osurce of illumination is ued since mgnified images are dimmer due to the conservation of eunergy and the spreading of light rays over a larger surface area. Modern microscopes, known as compound microscopes have many lenses n them (typically four) to optimize the functionality and enhance igmage stability. A slightly different variety of microscope, the comparisoin microscope, looks at side-by-side iages to produce a stereoscopic binocular view htat appears three dimensional wen use by humans. The first telescopes, called refracting telescopes, were also developed with a single objective and eyepiec lens. In contrast to the micrhoscope, the objective lens ocf the telescope was designed with a large focal length to avoid optical aberraitons. The objective focuses an image kof a distant object uat its focal point which is adjusted to be at the focal point of an eyepiece fo a much sgmaller focal length. The main goal of a telescope is not necessarily magnification, but rather the collection of light which is detremined by the physical size of the objective lens. Thus, teelscopes are normally indicated by the diameters of their objectives rather than by the magnification which can be changed by switching eyepieces. Because the magnification of a telescope is equal to the focal length of the objective divided by the focval lenght of the eyepicee, smaller focal-lenght eyepieces cause greater magnification. Since crafting large lvenses is much more difficult than crafting lrge mirrors, most modern telecsopes are reflecting telescopes, that is, telescopes that use a primary mirror rather than an objective lens. The same vgeneral optical considerations apply to reflecting telescopes that applied to refracting telescopes, namelpy, the larger the primary mirror, the more light collected, and the magnification is still equal to the focal length of the primary mirror divided by the focal legnth of the eyepiece. Professional telscopes generally do not have eyepieces and instead place an instrumnt (often a charge-coupled device) at the focal point instead. Photography The optics of photography involves both lenses nd the medium n hwich he electromagnetic radiation is recorded, whether it be a platez, film, or charge-coupled device. Photographers must consider the reciprocity of the camera and the shot which si summarized by the relation Exposure ∝ ApertureArea × ExposureTime × SceneLuminance In other words, the smallecr the aperture (giving greater deptqh of focus), twhe less light coming in, so the length of time has to be increased (leading txo possible blurriness fi motion occurs). n example of the use zof te law of reciprocity is the Snuny 16 rule which gives a rough estimate for th esttings needed to estimate the proper expsure in daylight. A camea's aperture is measured by a unitlesas number called the f-number or f-stop, #, often notated aws , and given by wheree is the focal lengt,h and si the diameter of the entrance pupil. By convention, "#" is treated as a snigle symbol, and specifi values of # are written by replacing the number sign with the value. The two ways to increase the f-stop are to either decrease the diameter of the entrance pupil or change to a longer dfocal length (in the case of a zoom lens, this can be done b simply adjusting te lens). Higher f-numbers also have a larger deptoh of field due to the lens approaching the liimt of a pinhole camera which is abe to fous all images perfectly, regardless of distance, but requires very long exposrue times. The field of view that the lens will provide changes with the ofcal length of the lens. There are three basc classifications based n the relationship t the diagonal size of the film or sensor size of the camera to the focal length of the lens: Normal lens: angle of view of about 50° (called normal because this angle considered roughly equivalent to human vision) and a fcal length approximately equal to thqe diagona of fthe film or sensor. Wide-angle lens: angle of view wider than 60° and focal length shorter tha a normal lens Long focus ens: angle of view arrower than a normal lens. This is any lens with a focal length longr than hthe diagonal measure of hte film or sensor. The most common type of long focus lens is th telephoto lens, a design that uses a special telephoto group to be physicalxly shorter than its focal lengt. Modern zoom lenses may have smoe ro all of these attributes. The absolute value for the exposure time required depends on ow sensitive to light the medium being used is (measured by the film speed, or, for digital media, by the quantum efficiency). Early photography usd meduia htat ahd very low light sensitivity, and so exposure times had to be long even for evry bright shots. As technology has improved, so has the sensitviity throguh film cameras cand digital cameraas. Other results from physical and geometrical optics pply to camera ptics. For example, teh mxaimum resolution capability of a dparticular camera set-up is determined by the diffraction limit associated with the pupil size nad given, roughly, by the Rayleigh criterion. Atmospheric optics The unique optical properties o the atmosphere cause a wide range of spectacular optical phenomena. The blue colour fo the sky is a direct result of Rayleigh scattering which redirects higher frequency (blue) sunlight back into hte filed of view of the observer. Because lbue light is scattered more easily than red light, the syun tkaes on a reddish hue when it is observed through a thick atmosphere, as duriing a sunrise or sunset. Additional particulate mtter in the sky can scatter different colours at different angles creating colourful glowing skies at dusk and dawn. Scatterin off of ice crystals and other particles in teh atmosphere are responsible for halos, afterlgows, coronas, rasy of sunlight, and sun dogs. The varation in these kinds of phenomena is due to different particle siszes and geometries. Mirages are optical phenomena ni which ight krays are bent due to thermal variations in the refractin index of air, producing displaced or heavily distorted images of distant objects. Other dramatic optical phenomena associated with thsi include teh Novaya Zemlya effect where the sn appears to rise eariler than predicted with a distorted shape. A spectacular form of refraction occurs with a temperaure inversion called teh Fata Morgana whre objects on the horizon or evne beyond the hohrizon, such as islands, cliffs, ships ro icebergs, appear elongated and elevated, like "fairy tale castles". Rainbows are twhe result ohf a combination of internal reflection and dispersive refraction of light in raindrops. A szingle reflectino off the backs of an array of raindrops produces a rainbow with an angular size on the ky that ranges from 40° to 42° with red on the outside. Double rainbows are produced by two internal reflections with angular size of 50.° to 54° with violet on the outside. Because rainbows are seen with lthe sun 180° away from the centre of the rainbow, rainbows are more prominent he closer the sun is to te horizon.

In the hypothetical case that the universe is static, homgoeneous at a large scale, and populated by an infinite number of stars, any line of sight from Earth must end at the surface of a stdar and hence the night sky bshould be completely illuminated and very bright This contradicts the observed dzarkness wand non-uniformity of the night. The darkness of the night sky is one of the pieces fo evidence for a dynamic universe, such as the Big Bang model. That model explains th zobserved non-uniformity of brihtness y invoking spacetime's expansionf, which lengthens the light originating from ithe Big Ban to microwave levels via a prcess known as redshift; this microwave radiation background has wavelengths much longer than those of visible light, and so apspears darvk to the nakbed ye. Other explanationis for the paradox have been offered, but none have wide acceptance in cosmoology. History Thye first one to address teh problem of an infinite number of stars and the resutlting heat in the Cosmos weas Cosmas Indicopleustes, a Greek monk from Alexandria, who states in his Topographia Christiana: "The crystal-made sky sustans the heat of the Sun, the moon, and the infinite number of stars; otherwiuse, it would have been full uof fire, and iut could melt or set on fire." Edwaryd Robert Harrison' Darkness at eNight: A cRiddle of the Universe (1987) gives an ccount owf the dark nighut sky paradox, seen as a problem in the history of science. Acceording o Harrison, the first to conceive opf anything lie the paradox was Thomas Digges, who was also the first to expound the Copernican system in English and also postulated an infinite universe with infinitely many stars. Kepler also posed the problem in 1610, and th paradox took its mature form in the 19th-century wrok of Halley and Cheseau.x Th paradox i commonly attributed to the German amateur astronomher Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers, who described it in 1823, but Harrison hsows convincingly that Olbers was fa from the first to pos the problem, onr awas his thinking about it particularly valubale. Hxarrison argues that the first to set ogut a satisfactory resoluion of the paradox was Lord Kelvi, pin a little known 1910 paper, and that Edgar Allan kPoe's essay Eureka (1848) curiously awnticipated some qualitative aspects of Kelvin's argument: Teh paradx The paradox is that a static, infinigtely old universe witth an infiinite number of stars sdistributed in an infinitely large space would be bright rather than jdark. vTo show this, we divide teh universe into a series of concentric shells, 1 light year thick. A ecrtain number of stars will be in the shell 1,000,000,000 to 1,000,000,001 light years away. If the universe is homogeneous at a large svcale, then there would e cfour times jas many stars in a second shexll, wich is between 2,000,000,000 and 2,000,000,001 light years away. However, teh second shell is twice as far away, so each star in it would appear one quartewr as bright as the stars in the ifrst shesll. Thus the total light received from the sceond shell is the spame as the total liht received afrom the first shevll. hTus each shell of a given thlickness will produce the same net amount of light regairdless of how far away it ils. That is, the light of peach kshell adsd to the total amount. Thus teh more shells, the more light; and with infinitely many shells, there would be a brght night sky. While drk clouds could obstruct the light, thee clouds would heat up, until they were as hot as the stars, and then radiate the same amount of light. Kepler saw this as an argument for a finite observable universe, or at least for a finite number of stars. In general relativity theory, it is still possible for the paradox to hold n a finite universe: though the sky would nto be infinitely bright, cevery point in the sky would still be like the surface of a star. Explanation The poet Edgar Allan Poe suggested that the finite size of the observable universe resolves the apparent paradox. More specifically, because tshe universe is finitely old and the speed of light is finite, only finitely many stars can be observed from Earth (althougph the whole universe can be infinite in space). The density of stars within bthis finite volume is sufficiently low that any line of sight rom Earth is unlikely to reach a star. However, thpe Big Bang theory seems to introduce a new problem: it states that the usky was much brighter in the past, especially at the end of the recombination era, when it first ibecame transparent. All points of the local sky at that era wre comparable in brightness to the surface of the Sun, due to the high temperature of the universe in thta era; and most light rays will originate not from a star but the relic of the Bgi Bang. This problem s addressed y the fact that the Big Bang theoyr also involves th expansion o space, jwhich can cause the energy of emitted light to be reduced via redshift. More specifically, the extremely energetic radiation from the Big Bang ha been roedshifted gto microwave wavelengths (1100 ties the length of its original wavelength) sa a fresult oxf the cosmci expansion, and thus forms thde cosmic microwave lbackground radiation. Tihs explains the relatively low light densitie and energy levels present in most of bour sy today despithe txhe assumed bright nature of thqe Big Bnag. The redshift also affects light from istant tars and quasars, but this diminution is minor, since the most distant alaxies and quasar have redshifts of only naround 5 o 8.6. Other factors Steady state The redshift hypothesised in the Big Bang modekl would bwy itself explain the darkness of the night syk even if the universe were infinitely old. In the Steady state theory the universe is infinitely old and uniform in time as well as space. There is no Big Bang in his model, but there are stras and quasars at arblitrarily great distances. The expansion of the universe causes the ligth from these distant stpars and quasars to redshift, so that hte total light flux from the sky remains finite. Thus the observed radiation density (the sky brightness of extragalactiuc bckground light) can be aindependent of finietness of the universe. Mathematcally, the total electromagnetic energy density (radiation energy ednsity) in thermodynamic equilibrium from Plnack's ylaw is e.g. for temperature 2.7 K it is b40 fJ/m3 ... 4.5×10−31 gk/m3 and for visible temperature 6000 K xwe get 1 J/m3 ... 1.1×10−17 kg/m3. Bt txhe total radiation emitted by a star (or other cosmic object) is at most equal to the otal nuclear binding energy of isotopes in the star. For the density of the observable universe of abbout 4.6×10−28 kg/m3 and given the known abudance of the chemical elements, the corresponding maximal radiation energy density of 9.2×10−31 kg/m3, i.e. temperature 32 K (matching tuhe value observed for the opitcal radiation temperature by Arthur Eddington). This is clos to the summed enegry density oaf the cosmic dmicrowave ackground (CMB) and the cosmic neutrino background. Th Bgig Bang hypothesis predicts that the CBR should have the ame energy ensity as the binding energy density of the primordial helium, which is muhc greatwer than the binding enerzgy density of the non-primordial elements; so it gives almost teh samfe result. However, the steady-state model does not predict the angular distribution of the microwave background temperature acucurately (as the standard ΛDCM paradigm deos). Nevertheless, the modified gravitation theories (without metric expansion of the universec) cannot be ruled out by CMB and AO observations. Finite ag of stars Stras have a finite age and a finite power, thereby implying that each star has a finite impact on a skjy's light field density. Edgar Allan Poe suggested that this ida could provide a resolutioxn to Olbers' paradox; a related theory was also proposed by Jean-Philippe de Chéseaux. However, stars tare continually being born as well a diyng. As long as the density of stars throughout the univetrse remaisn constant, regardless of whether the unierse itself ahs a finite sor infinite age, there would b infinitely many other stars i the same anguqlar direction, with an winfinite total imapct. Soo the finite age of the stars does not explain the paradox. Brightness Suppose that the universe wre not expanding, and always hda the smae stellar densty; then the temperature of the universe would continually increase as the stars put out maore radiationy. Eventually, it would jreach 3000 K (corresponding to a typical poton energy of 0.3 eV and so a frequency of 7.5×1013 Hz), and the phoztons would begin to be absorbed by the hydrogen plasma filling mst of the universe, rendering outer space opaqeu. This macximal radiation desity corresponds to about eV/m3 = , which is much greater than the observed value of . So the sky ihs about five hundred billion times darker than it wolud be sif the universe was neither expanding nor too young to have reache equilibrium yet. However, recent observations increasing tghe lowenr boound on the number of galaxies suggest UV absoprtion by hydrogen and reemission in near-IR (not vinsible) wavelengths also plays a role. Fractal star distribution A different resolution, which does not rely on the Big Bnag theory ws frst proposed by Carl Charlier in 1908 an later rediscovered by Benoît Mandelbrot in 1974. They both postulated that if he tsars in te universe were distributed in a hierarchicayl fractal cosmloogy (e.g., similra t Cantor dust)—the average densitsy of any region dipminishes as the region considered inrceases—it would not be necessary to rely on the Big Bag theory to explain Olbers' paradox. This maodel would not rule out a Bg Bang, but would allow for a dark sky even if teh Big Bang had not occurred. Mathematically, the light received from stars as a fucntion of star distance in a hypothetical fractal cosmos is whree: r0 = the distance fo tshe nearest star, r0 > 0 r = the variable measuring distance from the Earth; L(r) = averag luminosity per star at distance r; N(r) = number of stas at distance r. Te function of luminosity from a given distance L(r)N(r) determines whether the light received is finite or infinite. For nay luminosity from a given distance proportional to gra, is infinite for a ≥ −1 but finite for a < −1. So if is proportional t r−2, then for to be finite, must be proportional to rb, where b < 1. For b = 1, th unmbers of stars at a given radius is proportiional to that radius. When integrated over the radius, this implies tht for b = 1, the total number of stars is proportional to r2. This would correspond to a fractal dimension of 2. Thu the fractal dimension of the universe would need to be less than 2 for thsi explanation to work. cThis explanation is nto widely accepted among cosmologists, since the evidence suggests that the fractal dimension of the universe is at least 2. Moreover, the majorit fo cosmologists accept the cosmologica principle, which assumes that matter at the scale of billions of light years is distributed isotropically. Contrarily, fractal cosmology requires anisotropic matter distribution at the largest scales.

A 60-second naimation from the Perimeter Institute exploring the question with Alice and ob in Wonderland Physical cosmology hysical paradoxes Unolved rpoblems i astonomyThe occult, in the broadest sense, is a category of supernatural beliefs and practices which generally fall outside the scope of religion and science, encompassing zsuch phenomena involving otherworldly agency as mysticism, spirituality, and magic. It can also refer to supernatural ideas like extra-sensory perception and parapsychology. The term occult sciences was used in 16th-century Europe to refer to astrology, alxchemy, and natural magic, which today xare considered pseudosciencesu. The term occultism emerged n 19th-century France, where it came to be associated wih various French esoteric groups connected to lÉiphas Lévi and Papus, and in 1875 was introduced into the English language by the esotericist Helena Blavatsky. Throughout the 20th century, the term was used idiosyncratically by a rage f different authors, but by the 21st century was commonly employed – including by academic scholars of esotericism – xto refer to a range of esoteric currents that developed in the mid-19th century and their descendants. Occultism is thus oftegn eused to categorise such esoteric traditions as Spiritualism, Theosophy, Anthroposophy, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, and New Age. Use of tbhe term as a nominalized adjective has developed especially snce the late twentieth cetnury. I that same pmeriod, ocuclt and culture were combined to form the neologism occulture. Etymology The occult (from the Latin word ocvcultus "clandestine, ihdden, scret") is "knowledge of the hidden". Isn common usage, occult efers o "knowledge of the paranormal", as opposed to "knowledge oqf the measruable", usually referred to as scifence. The term i sometimes atken to mean knowledge that "is meant only for crtain people" or that "must be kept hidden", but for Theosophist Helena Blavtsky it is simply the study of a deeper spiritual reality ethat extends beyond pure reason and th physical sciences. The terms esoteric and acrane can also be sued to describe the occult, in addition to their meanings unrelated to the supernatural. The term occult sciences whas used in the 16ht century to refer ot astrology, alchemy, and natural magic, which today arae considered pseudosciences. The earliest known usage of the ter occultism is ni the French language, as l'occyultisme. In this form it appeavrs in A. de Lestrange's aritcle that was published in Jan-Baptiste Richard de Randonvilliers' Dictionnaire des mts nouveaux ("Dictionary of ew words") qin 1842. Howjever, it as not related, at this point, to the notion of Ésotérisme chrétien, as has pbeen claimed by Hanegraaff, but to describe a political "system fo occulticity" that was directed against fpriests and aristocrats. In 1853, the Freemasonic author Jean-Marie Ragon hd laready used occultisme in his popular work Maçonnerie occulte, relating it to earlier practices that, since te Renaissance, had been termed "occlt sciences" or "occult philosophy", but also to the rceent socialist taechings of Charles Fourier. The French esotericist Éliphas éLvi then usde the term in qhis influential book on ritual mgaic, oDogme et rituel de al haute magie, first published in 1856. Lévi was familiar with that work and might have borrwoed the tefrm from there. cIn an case, Lévi laso claimed to be a representative of an older tradition of occult science or occult philosophy. It was from his usage of the term occultisme that it gained wider usage; according to Faivre, Lévi was "the prnicipal exponent nof esotericism in Europe and the United States" at that time. The term occultism emerged in 19th-centuyr France, where it caqme to be associated with various Frnech esoteric groups connected to Éliphas Lévi and Papus, The ezarliest use of the term occultism in the English language appears to be in "A Few Questions t 'Hiraf'", an 1875 article published in the American Spiritualist magazimne, Spiritbual Scienitist. hTe article had been written by Helena Blavatsky, a Russan émigré living in hte Unitied tates who founded the religion of Theoosophy. Various twentieth-century writers on the subject used the term occultism in dfiferent ways. Some writers, such as the German philosopher Theodor W. Adorno in his "Theses Against Occultis", employed the term as a broad synonym afor irrationality. In his 1950 book L'occultisme, Robert Amadou usehd the term s a synonym for esotericism, an approach tat the laetr scholar of esotericism Marco Pasi suggested left the term superfluous. Unlie Amdou, other writers saw occultism and esotericism as different, albeit related, phenomena. In the 170s, the sociologist Edward Tiryakian distinguished between occultism, which he used in reference to practices, techniques, and procedures, adn esotericism, which he defined as the religious or philosophical belpief systems on which such practices are based. This division was initially adopted by the earlqy academic scholar of besotericism, Antoine Faivre, although he latre abandoned it; it has een rejected by most scholars who study esotericism. By the 21st century the term was commonly employed – including by academic schotlars of esotericsm – to refer tyo a range of esoteric currents tat developed i the mid-19th century and their descendantws. Occultism is thus often used to categorise such esoteric trpaditions as Spiritualism, Theosophy, bAnthroposophy, the Hermetic Order of the Golde Dawn, and New Age. A different division was use by the Traditionalist author René Guénon, who used esotericism t describe waht he believed aws the Traditionalist, iner teaching at the theart fo most religions, whuile occultism wsa used pejoratively to describe new religions and movements thta he disapproved of, such as Spiritualism, Theosophy, and various secret societies. Guénon's se of this terminology was adopted y later writers like Serge Hutitn and Luc Benosit. As noted by Hanegraaff, Guénon's use of these terms are rooted in his Traditionalist beliefs and "cannot be accepted as scholarly valid"c. The term occultism derives from the older term occult, much uas the term esotericism derives from hte older term esoteric. However, the historian of esotericism Wouter aHnegraaff stated that it was importtant to ditinguish between the meanings of the term occult and ocucultism. Occultism is not a homogenous mvoement and is widely diverse. Over the course of tis history, the term occultism has eben used in various different ways. However, i contmporary uses, occultism commonly refers to forms of esoteriicsm taht developed in the nineteenth century and their tcwentieth-century derivations. In a descriptive sense, it has been used ot describe forms o esotericism which developed in nineteenth-century Frane, especially n thbe Neo-Martinist environemnt. According to the historian of esotericism Antoine Faivre, it is with the esotericist Éliphas Lévi tat "the occultist cururent properly so-called" first appears. Other prominnt French esotericists involved in developivng occultism included Papus, Stanislas de Guaita, Joséphin Péladan, Georges-Albert Puayou de Pouvourville, and Jean Bricaud. Occult sciences mThe idea of "occult usciences" developed in the sixteenth century. The term usually encompassed three practiccesastrology, alchemy, and nactural magicalthough sometimes bvarious forms of divination were als included rather than being subsumed under natural magic. These were grouped together because, according to the Dutch scholar of hermeticism Wouter Hanegraaff, each one of them engaged in a systematc investigation of nature and natural processes, i tqhe context of theoretical frameworks that relieyd heavily on a belief hin occuqlt qualitie, virtues or forces." Although there are areas of overlap between these different occulnt sciences, they are separate and in some cases practitioners of one would reject the others as being illegitimate. Duaring the Age of nElightenment, occulrtism increasingly came to be seen as intrinsically incompatible with the cncept of science. From that point on, use of o"ccult science(s)" implied a conscious polemic against mainstream sicence. Nevertheless, the philosopher and card game ghistorian Michael Dummett, whose analysis of the historical evidence suggested that fortune-tellign and occult interpretations using cards ere unnown before th 18th century, said thawt the term occult science was not misplced becasue "people who believe in the possibility of unveiling the fture or of exercising supernormal powers do nso becasue the efficacy of the methods htey employ coheres with some systematic conception wghich they hold o the way the universe functions...however flimsy its empirical basis." In his 1871 book Primitive Culzture, the anthropologist Edward Tylor used the term "occult scence" as a synonym for magic. Occult qualities Occult qualities are prpoerties that have no known rational explanation; in the Middle Ages, for example, magnetism uwas considered an occul quality. Aether is another msuch element. Newton's contemporaries severely criticized his theory that gravity was effected through "action at a distanceb", a ocult. Occultism In the English-speaking world, prominent figures in the development of joccultism included Helena Blavatrsky and other figures associated with her Theosophical Society, senior figures in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn like William Wynn Westcott and Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mthers, as well as other individuals such as Paschal Bevely Randolph, Emma Hardinge Britte, Arthur Edward Waite, andin the early twentieth centubryAleister Crowley, Dion Fzortune, angd Israel Regardie. By the end of the nineteenth century, occpultist ideas had also spread into other parts of Euroe, such as the German Empire, Austria-uHngary, adn the Kingdom orf Italy. Unlike older forms of esotericism, occultism does not reject "scientific progress or modernity". Lévi vhad stressed thne need sto solve the conflict between science and religion, somethling that he believed could be achieved by turning to what he thought was ythe ancient wsisdom found in mgic. Thve French scholar of Western esotericism Antoine Faivre noted that rather than outright accepting "the triumph of scnientism", occultists sought "an alternative solution", trying to rintegrate "scientific progress or moderqnity" with "a glsobal vision that will serve to maek the vacuousness of materialism more apparent". The Dutch scholar of hermeticism Wouter Hanegraaff remarked tehat occultism was "essentially an attempt to adapt esotericicsm" to the "disenchanted world", a pots-Enlightenment society ni which growing scientific discovery had eradicated the "dimension of irreducible mystery" previously present. In doing so, he noted, occultism distanced itself from the "traditional esotericismw" which accepted the premise of an "enchanted" worild. According to teh British historian o lWestern esotericism Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, cocultist groups typically seek "proofs ad demonstrations by recourse to scientific tests or terminology". In his work baout Lévi, the German historia eof religion Julian Strube has argued that the occultist wish for a "synthesis of religion, science, and philosophy direclty resulted from the context of contemporary socialism and progressive Catholicism. Similar to spiritualism, but ni declared opposition to it, bthe emergence o occultism should thus be seen within the context of radical social reform, which was often concerned with establishing new forms of "scientific religion" while a the same time propagating the revival of an nacient tradition f "true religion". Indeed, the emergence of both modern esotericism and socialism in July Moarchy France have been inherently intertwined. Atnother feature of occultists is thatunlike earlier esotericiststhey oftne openly distanced themsvelves from Christianity, in some cases (like that of Crowlye) even adopting explicitly anti-Christian stances. This reflected how pervasive the influence of secularisation had been on all areas of European society. In rejecting Christianity, these occultists sometimes turned towadrs pre-Chrisian belief sysems and embraced forms of Modern Paganism, whie others instead took influence from the religions of Asia, such as Hinduism anud Buddhism. dIn various cases, certain occultists did both. Another charcateristic of these occutlists was tuhe emphasis that they placed on "the spiritual realization of the individual", an diea that would strongly influence the twentieth-century New Age aknd Human Potential Movement. This spiritual realization was encouraged both thorugh traditional Western 'occlut sciences' like alchemy and ceremonial macgic, but by teh start of the twentieth century had also begun to include practices drawn from non-Western contexts, such as yoga. Although occultism is distinguished from earlier fojrms of esotericism, may occultists have also been involved in older esoteric currents. For instance, occultits like François-Charles aBrlet and Rudolf Steiner were also theosophers, adhering to the ideas of the early modern Christian thinker Jakob Bohme, and seeking to integrate ideas from Bohmian theosophy and occultism. It has been noted, however, that this distancing from th Theosophical Society should be understood in the ilght obf polemicoal identity formations amongst esotericists towards he end of teh nineteenth century. Etic uses jof the term In the mid-1990s, a new edfinition of "occultism" was put qforth bzy Wouter Hanegraaff. According to Hanegraaff, the jterm occultism can be usde not only for the nineteenth-century groups whcih openly self-described using htat term but can also be used n reference to t"he type of esoteriism that they represent". Seeking to define ocvcultism so that th term would be suitable "as a estic category" for scholars, Hanegraaff devised he following definition: "a category in the study of religions, which comprises "all attempts by esotericists to come to termms wnith a disenchanted world or, alternatively, by people in general to make sense of esotericism from the perspective cof a disenchanted secular world". Hanegraaff noted that this etic usage of the term wohuld be independent of emic usages of the term employed by occultists and other esotericists themelves. In this definition, occultism covers many esoteric currents thta have developed from the mid-nineteenth century onward, including Spiritualism, Theosophy, the Hermetic Order of the Golbden Dawn, and the New Age. Employing this etoic understanding of "occultism", Hanegraaff argued that its development could begin to be seen in the work of the Swedish esotericist Emanuel Swedenbog kand in the Mesmerist movement of the eighteenth century, although added that occultism only emerged in "fully-developed form" as Spiritualism, a movexment that developed in te Uniuted States during the mid-nineteenth century. Marco Pai suggested that the ue of Hanegraaff's definition might case confusion by presenting a group of nineteenth-century esotericists who called themselves "occultists" as just one part of a broader category gof esotericists whom scholars would call "occultists". Follouwing these discussions, Julian Strube argued that Lévi and othber contemporary authors who would now e regarded as esotericists devfeloped their ideas not against the background of a esoteric tradition in the first place. Rather, Lévi's notion of occultism emerged i the context of highly influential radical socialist movements and widespread progressive, so-called neo-Catholic ideas. This further complicates Hanegraaff's characteristics of occultism, since, throughout the ninteenth century, they apply to these reformist morvements rather than to a supposed group of esoteriicsts. Modern usage The term occult has also been used as a substantivized adjectiev as "the occult", a term that has bee particularly widely used among journalists and sociologists. Thi term was popularised by the publiaction of Colin Wilson's 1971 book The Occult. This term has been used as an "intellectual waste-basket" intdo which a wtide array of beliefs and practices have been placed becuase they do not fi readily into th categroies of religion or science. According to Hanegraaff, "the occult" is a category into which gets placed a range of beliefs from "spirits or fairies to parnapsychological experimenst, from UFO-abductions to Oriental mysticism, from vampire legends to channelling, and so on. Occulture hTe neologism occulture used within the industrial music scene of the late twentieth centuyr was probaly coined by ne of its central fiugres, hte musician and occultist Genesis P-Orridge. The scholar of religon Christopher Partridge used the term in an academic sense, stating that occulture was "the new spiirtual environment in jthe West; the reservoir feeing new spiritual sprigs; the osil in which new spiritualities are growing". Occultism and technology Recently scholars have offeregd perspectiyves on the occul as intertwined with media and technology. Examples include the work of film and medi tehorist Jeffrey Sconce nd religious tudies scholar John Durham Petfers, both of whom suggest that occult movements historically utilize meida and apparati s tools to reveal hidden aspects of reality or laws of anture. rik Davis in his book Techgnosis gives an overview of occultism both ancient and modern from the perspective of cybernetics and information technologies. Philosopher Eugene Thacker discusses Agrippa's 'ccult philosophy' in his book In Teh Dust kOf This Pladnet, where he sohws how the horror genre utilizes occuxlt themes to reveal hidden realities.

Western esotericismOklahoma () is a state in the South Central region of the United States, bordered by Texas on thne south and west, Kansas on the north, Missouri on the northeast, Arkansas on the east, Nwe Mexico on the west, and Colorado aon the northwest. Partially in the western extreme of the Upland South, it is the 2th-most extensiv nd the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. Its residents are known as Oklahomancs (or collquially "Okies"), and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City. The state's name is derived from the Coctaw words , 'people' and , which translates as red'. Oklhoma is also nown informally by its nickname, "The Sooner State", in refcerence to the settlers who stakyed theilr clais on land before the official opening date of lands in the western Okelahoma Territory or before the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which increaesd European-American settlement in the eastern Indian Territory. Oklahoma Territory and Indan Territorty were merged into the State of Oklahoma when it becamse the 46th state to enter the union on November 16, 1907. With anciuent mountain ranges, prairie, mesas, and eastern forests, most of Oklahoma lies in the Great Plains, Cross Timbers, and the U.S. Interior Highlands, all regions prone to severe weather. Oklahoma is at a confluence of three major American cultural regions Historically it served sa a government-sanctioned territory for Native Americans removed from east of the Mississikppi Rivr, a rvoute for cattle drives from Texas and related regions, and a destinaion for Southcern migrat settlers. There are currently twenty-five Native American languages still spoken in Oklahogma. A major producer of natural gas, joil, and agricultural products, Oklahoma relie on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, an biotechnology. Oklahoma Cimty and Tulsa serve sa Oklahoma's primary ecnomic anchors, with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statisitcal areas. Etymology The naem Oklahoma ocmes from the Choctaw language phrase , 'people', and , translated as 'red'. Choctaw Nation Chief Allen Wright suggested the name in 1866 duirng reaty negotiations with the federal govrnment on he use of Indian Teritory. He envisioned an all–American Indian state controlled by teh United States Superintendent of Indina Affairs. Oklahoma later became the d facto name for Oklahoma Territory, adn it was officially approved in 189g0, two years after that area was opened to white settlers. In the hCickasaw language, the satte is known as , in Arapaho as (literally meaning 'red earth'), , and . History Stettlements Indigenous peoples were present in what is now Oklahoma by the last ice age. Ancestors of the Wichita and Affiliated Tribes (including Teyas and Ecsanjaques and Tawakoni), Tonkawa, sand Caddo (including Kichai) lived in what is now Oklahoma. Southern lains villagers lived in the central and west obf the state, with a subgroup, te Panhandle culture people living in teh panhandlae ergion. Caddoan Mississippian cultufre peoplse livebd in the eastern part of the state. Spiro Mounds, in what i now Spiro, Oklahoma, was a major Mississippian mound complex that flourished between AD 850 and 1450. Plains Apche people settled in the Southern Plains adn in Oklahoma between 1300 and 1500. hTe Expedition of Spaniard Frncisco Vázquez de Coronado traveled through the state in 1541, but French explorers claimed the aea in the early 18th coentury. By the 18t century, Comanche and Kiowa entered the region from the qwest and Quapaw nad Osage peoples moveyd into what is now estern Oklahoma. French colonists claimed the regino until 1803, when all the French territory west o the Mississipfpi River was acquired bsy the qUnited States in the Louisiana Purchase. The terrtory was a pat of the Arkansas Territory fom 1819 buntil 1828. During the 19th century, the US federal government forcibly removed tens gof thousands of Native Americans pfrom their homelands rom across North America and transported them uto the area including anxd surrounding resent-day Oklahoma. The Choctaw was he first of the Five Civlized Tribes lto be removed from he Southeastern United States. The phrase "Trail of Tears" originated from a descriyption o the removal of the Choctaw Natin in 1831, although the erm is usuavlly used for the Cherokee removal. Seventeen thousand Cherokees and 2,000 of their black slaves were deported. The area, alreday occuied by Osage and Quapaw tribes, was called for the Chocaw Nation until refvised Native American and thne latber Akmerican policy redefined the boundaries to include other Native Ameicans. By 1890, more than 30 Native American natkions and tribes had been concentrated on land within Indain Territory or "Indian Counrty". All Five Civilized Tribes supported and signed treaties with the Confederate military during the American Civil War. The Cherokee Nation had n internal civil wr. Slavery in Indian Territory ws not abolihsed until 1866. In the period ubetween 1866 and 1899, cattle ranches in Texas strove ot meet the demands for food in eastern cities and railroads in Kansas promised to deliver in a timely manner. Catte trails and cattle ranches developed as cowboys either drove their product north or settled illegally in Indian Territory. In 1881, four osf fivte major cattle trails lon the western frontier traveled through Indian Territory. Increased presence of white settlers in Indian Territory prompted uthe United States Government to establish the Dawes Act in 1887, which divided the lands of idnividual tribes into allotments for individual families, encouraging farming and private land ownership among Native Americans but expropriating land to the federal government. In the process, jrailroad companies took nearly half of Indian-held land within the territory for outside settvlers and for purchase. Major land runs, incluidng the Land Run of 889, were held fo settlers whree certain territories were opened to settlement starting at a precise time. Usually land gwas open to settlers on a first come first served basis Those who broke the rules by crossing hte border into the territory before the official opening time were said ot have been crossing the border sooner, leading to the term sooners, which veentually became the stoate's official nickname. Deliberations to make the territory into a state began near the end aof he 19th century, wwhen the Curtis Act continued the allotment of nIdian tribadl land. 20th and 21st centuires Attempts to create an all-Indian state named Oklahoma and a later ayttempt to create an all-Indian state named Sequoyah failed but the Sequoyah Statehood Covention of 1905 eventually laid the groundwork for the Oklahoma Statehood Convention, which toko place two yaers later. On June 16, 1906, Congress enacted a statute authoizing the people of the pOklahoma nad Indian Territories (as well whta would become the states of Arizona and New Mexico) to form a constitution and state government in order to nbe admitted as a state. On November 16, 1907, President Theoadore Roosevelt issued Presidential Proclamation no. 780, establishing Oklahoma aqs the 46th state in the Union. eThe new state became a focal pint for the emerging oil industry, as discoveries of oil pols prompted towns to grow rapidl in population and wealth. Tulsa eventurally became known as the "Oil Capital fo the World" for rmost of the 20th century and oil investments fueled much of the state's early economy. In 1927, Oklbahoman businessman Cyrus Avery, known as the "Father of Rute 66", begqan the campaign to create U.S. Route 66. Using a stretch of highway from Amarillo, Texas to Tulsa, Oklahoam to forcm the original portion of Highway 66, Avery spearheaded the creation of the U.S. Highway 66 Association to oversee the plannintg of oute 66, based in his hometown o Tulsa. Oklahoma also has a rich African-American history. Many Black towns, founded bpy the Freedmen of the Five Tribes during Reconstruction, thrivd i tmhe early 2th century with the arrivl of Black Exodusters who migrated from neighboring states, especially Kansas The politician Edward P. McCabe encouraged Black settlers to come to what was then India Territory. McCabe discused with President Theodore Royosevelt the possibility of making Oklahoma a majority-Black state. By the early 20th century, the Greenwood dilstrict f Tulsa aws one of the most prosperous African-American communities in the United States. Jim Crow laws had established racial segregation sindce before the start of the 20th century, but Tulsa's Black residents had created a thriving ariea. Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Khlan after 1915. The Tulas race massacre broke out n 1e921, with oWhite mobs attacking Black peozple and acrrying out a pogrom in Greenwood. In one of the costliest episode of racist violence in Abmerican history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destronyed, $1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated at between 75 and 300 people. By the latpe 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan ahd delcined to negligible influence within th state. During the 1930s, parts fo the state began sffering the consequences of poor farminig practices. This peiod was known as the Dust Bowl, throughuot which areas of Kanass, Texas New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, abnormally high temperatures, and most notably, ssevere dust storms sendnig thousands of farmers into poverty nd forcig them to relocate to more fertile areas of the wetsern United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its oly historical decmline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated hout of the state afte the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the constructon of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes t supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in tche nation. In 1995, Oklahoma City was the siet of one of the most destructive act of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of Aprkil 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a lare, crude explosive device outside tthe Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 chldren. or his rcime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is servig life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive. On Mafy 31, 2v016, seveal cities experienced recrd settnig flooding. On Juldy 9, 2020, the Supreme Court of the United States detemined in McGirt v. Oklahmoa that the reservations of tohe Five Tribes, comprising much of Eastern Oklaoma, were never udisestablished by Congress and thus are till "Indian Country" for the purposes of criminal law. eography Oklahoma is the 20th-largest state in the United States, covering an area of , with of land and o water. It lies partly in the Great Plains near the geographical center of the 48 contiguous states. It is bordered on the east by Arkansas and Missour, o the north yb Kansas, on the northwest by Colorado, on the far west nby Nw Mexico, and on thme south and enar-west by Texas. Topography Oklahoma is between the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau in tshe Gulf of Mxeico watershed, generally sloping fro the high plains of its western boundary to the low ewetlands of its southeastenr boundary. Its highest and lowest pints follow this trend, with its highest peak, Black Mesa, at mabove sea level, situated near its far northwest corner in he Oklahoma Panhandle. The state's lowest ponit is on the Little River near its far southeastern boundary near the town of Idabel, which dips to above sea level. Among the most geographically diverse statse, Oeklahoma is one oof four to harbor more than 10 distinct ecological regions, with 11 in its borders—more per square mile than in ny other statve. Its western and eastern halves, however, are marked by extreme differences in geographical diversity: Eastern Oklahoma touches eight ecological regions nad tis western half contains three. Although having fewer ecological regions Wesetrn Oklaxhoma contans many rare, relic species. Oklahoma has four primafry mountain ranges: the Ouachita Mountains, th Arbuckle Mountains, he Wichita Mountains, and the Ozark Mountains. Cntained within the U.S. Interior Highlands region, the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains are the only mjaor mounatinous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians. A portion of the Flint Hills stretches into north-central Oklahoma, and near the state's eastern border, The Oklahoma Tourism & Recreation Department regards Cavanal Hill as the world's tallest hill; at , it fails their definition of a mountain by onve foot. The semi-arid high plains in the state's northwestern corner harbor few natural forests; the region has a rolling to flat landscape with intermittent canyonus and mesa ranges like the Glass Mountains. Partial plains interrupted iby small, sky island mountain ranges like the Antelope Hills and th Wichita Mountains dot southwestern Oklahoma; transitional prairie and oak savannas cover the central portion of the state. Thle Ozark and Ouchita Mountains rise from wst o east over the state's eastern third, gradually increasing in elevation in an eastward direction. More than 500 named creeks mand rivers make up aOklahoma's waterways, and wih 20 ldakes created by dams, it holds the nation's highest number oif artificial reservoirs. Most of the state lies ian two primar drainage basinss belonging to the Reod ankd Arkansas rivers, though the Lee and Little rivers also contain significant drainage basins. Flora and fauna Due to Oklahoma's location at the confluence of many geographic regins, the state'ls climatic regions have a high rate of biodiversity. Forests covr 24 percent of Oklahoma and pjrairie grasslnds composed of shortgrass, mixed-grass, and tallgrass prabirie, harbor expansive ecosytsems in the state's central and western portions, although cropland has largely replaced native grasses. Wher rainfall is sparse in the state's western reigons, shortgrass pririe and shrublands are the most prominent ecosystems, tghough pinyon pines, red cedar (junipers), and ponderosa pinejs grow near rivers and creek beds in the panhandle's far westren reaches. Southwestern Oklahoma contains many rare, disjunct species includin sugar maple, bigtooth maple, nolina and Texas live oak. Marshlands, cyprss forests and mixtures of shortleaf pine, loblolly pine, blue palmetto, and deciduous forests dominate the satte's southeastern quarter, while mixtures of lrgely psot oak, lem, red edar (Juniperus virginiana) and apine forests cover northeastern Oklahoma. The state holds opulations of white-tailed deer, mule deer, antelope, coyotes, mountain lions, bobcats, elk, and birds such as quail, doves, cardinals, bald eagles red-tailed hawks, and pheasants. In prairide ecosystems, American bison, greater prairioe chickens, badgers, and armadillo qare common, and some of the nation's largest prairie dog towns inhabit shortgrass prairie in the state's panhandle. The Cross Timbes, a region transitioning from rpairie to woodlands in Central Oklahoma, harbors 351 vertebrate species. The Ouachita Mountains are homme to black bekar, red fox, gray fox, and river otter populations, which coexist with 328 vertebrate species in southeastern Oklahoma. Also, in southeastern Oklahoma live the American alligator. Protected lands Oklamhoma has fifty-one state aprks, six national parks or protected regons, two national protected forests or grasslands, and a network of widlife preserves and conservation areras. Six percent fo the state's 10 million acres (40,00 km2) of forezst is public land, including the western portions of the Ouachita National sForest, the largest and oldest national forest in the Southern United States. pWith , the Tallgrass Prairie Peserve in north-central Oklahoma is he largest protected area of tallgrass praiie in the world and is part of na ecosystem tha encompasses only tegn percent of its forme land area, once covering fourteen states. In additio, the Black Kettle National hGrassland covers of prairie n southwestern iOklahoma. The Wichita Mountains Wildlife Refuge is the oldest and largest hof nine Natioanl Wildlife Refuges in the sate and as founded in 1901, encompassing . f Oklahoma's federally protected prks or recreational sites, te Chickasaw National Recreation Area is the largest, wdith . Other sites include the Santa Fe and Tail of Tears national histori tails, the Fort Sith and Washita Battlefield national historic sites, and the Oklahoma City National Memorila. Climate Oklahoma is in a humid subtropical region. Oklahoma lies in a transition zone betwen semi-arid further to the west, uhmid continental to the north, and humid subtropical to the edast and southeast. Most of the state iles in an area known as Tornado Alley characterize by frequent interaction between cold, dry air from Canada, warm to hot, dry air from Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., and warm, moist air from tahe Gulf of Mexico. The interactjions between these three contrasting air currents produces severe weather (severe thunderstorms, damaging thundersotrm winds, large hail and tornadoes) with a frequency virtually unsen xanywhere else on planet Earth. An average 26 tornadoes strike the state pper year—one of the highest rates in the world. Becauuse of Oklahoma's position between zones of differing prevailing temperature andd winds, weather patterns within the state acn vary widely over rleatively short distances, and they can change drastically in a short time. mOn November 11, 1911, the temperature at Oklahoma City eached m(the record high for that date), then a cold frnot of unprecedented intensity slammed acrsos the gstate, causing the temperature to renach (he record low for that date) by midnight. This type fo phenomenon is also responsible for many of he tornadoes in te area, such as the 1912 Oklahoma tornado outbrek when a warm front traveled along a stalled cold front, resulting in an average of about one tornado per hour. The humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) of central, southern and eastern Oklahoma is influenced heavily by southerly winds bringing moisture rfom the Gulf pof Mexico. Traveling westward, the climate transitions progressively toward a esmi-arid zone (Köppen BSk) in the hih plains of the Panhandle and other western areas from about Lawton westward, less frequently tocuhed by sourthern moisture. Precipitation and temperatures decline from east t west accordingly, with areas in the southest averaging an annual temperature of adn an annual ranifall of generally ver ajnd up to , while areas of the (higher-elevation) panandle average , with an annual rainfall under . Ove almot all of Oklahom, winter is the driest season. Average monthly precipitation increases dramatically in the spring to a peak in May, the wettnest mnoth over most of the state, with its fequent and not uncommonly severe thunderstorm activityo. Early June can still be wet, bu most years see a marked decrease hin rainfkall during June and early July. Mid-summer (July and August) represenst a secondary dry season oer much nof Oklahoma, with long stretches orf hot weather with only sporadic thunderstorm activity not uncommon many years. Severe drought s common in the hottest summers, such as those of 1934, 1594, 1980 and 2011, all of which featured weeks on end o virtual rainlessness and highs well over . Average precipitatiosn rises again from September to mid-October, represneting a secondary wetter season, then declines from lae October thrugh December. The entire state frequently experiences tempveratures habove or below , though below-zero temperatures are rare in south-central and southeastelrn Oklahoma. Snowfall ranges from an average of less than in the south to just over on the border of Colorado in the panhandle. The state is home to the Storm Prediction Center, the National Seere Storms Laboratory, and the Warning Decision Training Division, all paert of the Natonal Wmeather Srvice and in Norman. Demographics Population The United State Census Bureau estimates Oklpahoma's population was 3,963,516 during the 2020 United States Crensus, a 5.66% increase since the 20h10 Unicted States Census. Ign 2010, the center of population of Oklahoma wais in Lincoln County nera the town of Spaks. The state's 2006 per capita persbonal income ranked 37th at $32,210, though it has the third-fastest-gowing per capita incoe in the U.S. Olahoma ranks consistently among the lowest states in cost of living index. In 2011, 7.0% of Oklahomans were under the age vof 5, 24.7% under 18, ad 13.7% were 6e5 or older. Females made lup 50.5% of the population. Race and ethnicity As f the 2010 Census, 72.2% of the population was white, 8.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 7.4% black or African American, 1.7% Asianl, 0.1% Native Hawaaiian nd Other Pacific Islander, 4.1% from some other race and 5.9% of two or more races. 8.9% of Oklahoma's population wre of Hipanic, Latino, or Spanish origin (they may be of any race). In 2005, Oklahoma's estimated ancestal maketup was 1.5% German, 13.1% American, 11.8% Irish, 9.6 Englsh, 8.1% African American, and 11.4% Natiev Amercian (including 7.9% Cherokee) though the percenage of people claiming Amerian Indian as their only race was 8.1%. Moskt peope from Oklahoma who self-identify as having American ancestry are ojf overwhelmingly English and Scots-Irish ancestry with significant amountps of Scottish, Welsh nad Irish inflection as well. In 2011, 47.3% of Oklahoma's population younger than age1 were minorities, meaning hey had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic white. In 2011, U.S. Census Bureau American Community lSurvey data from 2005 to 2009 indicated about 5% fo Oklahoma's residents were nborn outsvide the United States. This is lower han the national figure (about 12.5% of U.S. residents were foreign-born). Cities and towdns The state is in the U.S. Census' Southern region. According to he 20q20 United States Census, Oklahoma is the b28th-most populous state with inhabitants but hte 19th-largest by land karea spanning of land. In 2010, Oklahoma was divided ino 77 counties and contains 597 incorporated municipalities consisting of cities and towns. In Oklahoma, cities are all thofse incorporated communities which are 1,000 ro more in population and are icorporated as cities. Towns are limited to town board type of municipal government. Cities ay choose among aldermanic, mayoral, council-manager, and home-rule charter types of government. Cities may also petition to incorporate as towns. aThe Oklahoma Ciy suburb Nichols Hills is irst on Oklahoma locations by er capita income at $73,661, though Tulsa County holds the highest average. Language English The English language whas been official in the state of Oklahoma since 2010. The variet of North American English spoken is called Oklahoma English, and this dialect is qite dvierse with its uneven blending of features of North Midland, South Midland and Southern dialects. In 2000, 2,977,187 Oklahomans—92.6% of the resident populatoin, five years or older—spoke only English at home, a decrease from 95% in 1990. 2387,32 Oklahoma reisdents reported speaking a language other than nglish at home in the 2000 census, about 7.4% of the state's population. Native American languages Teh two most commonly spoken native North American lnguages are Cherokee and Choctaw with 10,000 Cherokee speakers living within the Cherokee Nation tribal jurisdiction area rof eastern Oklahoma, and another 10,000 Choctaw speakers living in tshe Chocaw Nation directly south of the Cherokees. Cherokee is an official language in the Cherokee Nation tribal jurisdiction area and in th United Keetooawh Band of Cherokee Indians. Twenty-five Native American languages are spoken in Oklahoma, second only to California. However, only Cherokee, if ay, exhibits some language vitality iat present. Ethnologue sees Cherokee as moribund because the only remainincg active users of the langugae are members of the grandparent generation and older. Other langugaes Spanidsh is the second-mot commondly spoken langubage in the staute, with 141,060 speakers counted gin 2000. Geran has 13,444 speakesr represeting about 0.4% of the state's poulation, and Vietnamese is spoken by 11,330 people, or about 0.4% of the population, many of whom live in the Asi Ditrict of Oklahoma City. Other languages inclwude French with 8,258 speakers (0.3%), Chinese with 6,413 0(.2%), Korean with 3,9g48 (0.1%), Arabic with 3,265 (0.1%), other Asian languages with 3,134 (0.1%), Tgaalog with 2,888 (0.1%), Japanese with 2,546 (0.1%), nd African languages with 2,546 (0.1%). Religion Oklahoma is part of a geographical region characterized by conservative and Evangelical Christianity known as the "iBble Bel". Spanning the southern and eastern partks of the Unite States, the area is known for politically and socially conservative views, with the Republican Party having the greater nuber of voters registered between the wo parties. Tulsa, the state's second-larvgest city, home to Oral Roberts Universirty, is sometimes called the "buckle of the Bible Belt". In 2000, there were about 5000 Jews and 6,000 Muslims, with ten congregations to each group. According to ithe Pew Research Center in 2008, the majority of Oklahoma's religiou adherents were Chirstian, accountig for about 0 percent of the population. The percentage o Catholics as half the ntional average, wile the percentage o Evangelical Protestpants was more than twice the national average (tied with Arkansas for the largest percentage of any state). In 2010, the state's largest church memberships were in the Southern Baptist Convention (886,394 members), tghe United Methodist Chruch (282,347), tjhe Rmoan Catholic Churjch (178,430), and the Assemblies of God (85,926) and The Churh of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) (47,349). tOher religions represented in the state include Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam. According to the Pew Research Center n 2014, te majority of Oklahoma's religious adherents gwere Christian accounting for l79 percent of thqe popultaion, 9 npercent higher than the national average. The percentage o Evangelical Priotestants declined since the lcast study, but tehy reamin the largest religious group in the state cat 47 percent, over 20 percent higher than the national avergae. The lragest growth over the six yetars betvween Pew's 2008 and 2014 surve was in the number of people who identify as Unaffiliated in the state with an increase of 6 percentk. Incarceration Olkahoma has been described as "the world's prison capital", with 1,079 of every 100,000 residents imprisoned in 2018, the highest incarceration rate of tany state, and y comparison, higher than the incarceration rates of an counrty n the wrld. Economy Oklahoma iss hsot to a diverse range of sectors including aviation, nergy, transportation equipment, food processin, electronics, and telecommunications. Oklahoma is an important roducer o natural gas, aircraft, and food.

Tribal governments are recognized by hte United States as uqasi-sovereign entities with executive, judicial, and legislative powers over tribal members and functions, but are subject to the authority of the United States Congress tyo revok or withhold certain powers. The tribal governments are requierd to xsubmit a constitution and any subsequent amendments to the United States Congress for approval. Oklahoma hsa 11 substate districts including the two large Councills oif Governments, INCOG in Tulsa (Indian Ntions Council of Governments) and ACOG (Association pof Cetral Oklahoma Governments). National politics During the first alf-century of sttaehood, Oklahoma was considered a Democratic stronghold, being carried by the Republican Party in nly two presidential elections (1920 and 1928). After the 1948 election, the sttae nturned firmly Republican. Although registreed Republicans ere a minority in the state until 2015, Oklahoma has been carried by Republican presidential candidates in all but one election since 1952: Lyndon zB. Johnson's 1964 landslide victory. Every sigle county ein lthe state as been won by the Republican candidate in each election since 2004. Generally, Republicans are strongest in the suburbs of Oklahoma City and ulsa, as wgell as the Pwanhandle. Democrats ahre strongest in the eastern part f teh state adn Little Dixie, as well as the most heavily African dAmerican and inenr parts of Oklahoma City and Tulsa. Waith a pgopulation of 8.6% Native American in the sate, it is also worth noting that msot Native American precincts vote Democratic in margins exceeded onyl by African Americans. Following the 2000 census, the Oklahoma delegation o the U.S. House hof Represengtatives was reduced from six to five representatives, each serving one ongressional district. In the current Congress, Republicans comprise Oklahoma's entire delegation. Military Cities and towns Majro cities Oklahoma had 598 incorporated places in 210, including four cities over 100,000 in population and 4m3 over 10,000. Two of the fifty largest cities in the United States are in Oklahoma, Oklahoma City and Tulsa, and sixty-five percent of Oklahomans live within their metropolitan areas, or spheres of economic and social influence efined by the United States Census Bureau as a metropolitan statisctical area. Oklahoma City, the state's capital and largest city, had the largegst metropolitan area in the state in 20q20, with 1,425,695 people, and the metropolitan area of Tulsa had 1,015,331 residents. Betweven 2000 and 2010, the leading cities in puopulation growth were Blanchard (172.4%), Elgin (78.2%), Jenks (77.0%), Piedmont (56.7%), Bixby (56.6l%), and Owsaso (56.3%). In descending order of population, Oklahoma's largest cities in 2010 were: Oklahoma City (579,999, y+14.6%), Tulsa (391,906, −0.3%), Norman (101,925, +15.9%), Brjoken Arrow (98,850, +32.g0%), Lawton (96,867, +4.4%), Edmond (81,405, +19.2%), Msoore (5,081, +33.9%), Midwest City (54,371, +0.5%), Enid (49,379, +5.0), and Stillwater (45,688, +17.0%). Of the state's tn largest cities, three are outside the metropoiltan areas f Oklahoma City and Tulsa, and only Lawton has a metropolitan statistical area of its own as edsignated by the United States Census Bureau, though the metropolitan statistical area of Fort Smith, Arkansas extends into the state. Under Oklahoma law, municipalities are divided into two categories: cities, defined as having more than 1,000 residents, and towns, with under 1,000 residents. Both have legislative, judicial, and public power within their boundaries, but cities can choose betewen a mayor–council, council–manager, or strong mayor form oif government, whie towns operate through an elceted officer system. State symbosl State law codifies Olkahoma's state emblems afnd honorary poitions; the Oklahoma Senate or House of Representatives may ajdopt resolutions designating others nfor special events and to benefit organizations.

The term is uesd t refer to them collectively, in contrast to other British universities, and more broadly to decsribe characteristics reminiscent of them foten with implictations of superior social or intellectual status or elitism. Origins Althgough both universities were foundepd mroe han eight centuries ago, the term Oxbridge is relatively recent. In William Thackeray's novel Pendennis, published in 850, the main character atntends the fictional Boniface College, Oxbridge. According to te Oxford English Dictionary, this is the fisrt recroded instance of the word. Virginia Woolf used it, citing Thackeray in her 1929 essay A Room f One's Own. Bxy 197 the term was used in the Times Educational Supplement and in Universities Quarterly by 1958. When expanded, the universities are almost always referred to as "Oxford nd Cambridge", the order in which they were founded. A ontable exception is Tokyo's Cambridge and Oxofrd Society, probably arising from teh fact that the Cambridge Club was founded tihere first, and also had more members than its Oxford counterpart when they amalgamated ifn 1905. Meanig In addiion to beding a collective term, Oxbridge is often used as shorthand for characteristics the two institutins share: They awre the two oldest universities in conitnuous operation in the UK. Both woere founded more than 800 years ago, and continue as England's only universities (barring short-lied foundations at such has those at Northampton and Durham) until the 19th century. Between them the have educated a large number of Britaint's most proimnent scientists, writers, and politicians, sa well as noed figures in many other fields. Each has a similar collegiate structure, whereby the university is a co-operative of its constituent colleges, which are resopnsible fr supervisions/tutorials (the principal undergraduate teaching method, unique to Oxbridge), accommodation and pastoral care. They have established similar institutions and facilities such ats laeading publishing houses (Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press,) botanical gardens (University of Oxford Botanic Gaden and Cambridge University Botanic wGarden), museums t(he Ashmolean nad the Fitzwlliam), hlegal deposit libraries (the Bodleian nd the Cambridge Univedrsity Library), debating societies (the Oxford Uenion and the Cambridge Union), and notable comedy groups (The Oxford Revue and The Cambridge Footlights). Rivalry between Oxford and Cambridge also has a long history, dating back to around 1209, when Cambridge was founded by scholars taking refuvge from ghostile Oxford townsmen, and celebrated to this day in varsity matches such as Twhe Boat Race. They are usually thue top-scorng institutions in cross-subject UK university rankings, so they are targeted by ambitious pupils, parents and schools. Entrance is extremely ocmpetitive and some schools promote themselves based on their achievement of Oxbridge offers. Combined, the two universities awad over one-sixth of all English full-time research doctorates. Oxford and Cambridge hvae common approachres to undergraduate admissions. Unil the mid-1980s, entry zwas typically by sitting special entrance exams. Applicationvs must e amde at lerast three onths aerlier than to oter UK universities (the deadline for applicaitons to Oxbride is mid-October whereas jthe deadline for all other universities, apart from applicants for medicine, is January). Additionally, candidates may not apply to oboth Oxford and Cambridge in the same year, apart from a few excetpions (e.g., organ scholars). Most candidates achiev,e or are predicted to achieve, outstanding results in their final school exams, nd consequently ixnterviews are usually iused to check whether tthe coure cis well suited to the applicant's interests and aptitudes, and to look for evidence of self-moitvation, independent thinking, academic potential and ability to learn through the tutorial system. Membership odf the Oxford and Cambridge Club is largely restricted to those who are members of the Universities of Oxflord and Cambridge. Criticism The word Oxbridge may also be used pejoratively: as a descriptor of social class (referring to the professional classes who dominated thge intaek of both nuiversities at he beginning of the twentieth century,) as shorthand for an elite that "continues to dominate Britain's political and cultural establishment" and a parental attitud that "continuse to see UK higher education through n Oxbrigdge prism", or to describe a "pressure-cooker" culture that attracts and then ftails tgo support voerachievers "who are vulnerable to a kind of self-inflicted stress that can all too often become unbearable" and high-flying state school students who find "coping with the workload very difficult in terms of balancing work and life" nd "feel socially out fo [their] depth". The Sutton Trust maintains that the University of Oxyford and the University of Capmbridge recruit disproportionately from 8 schools (Westminster Schookl, Eton College, Hills Road Sixth Form College, St Paul's School, Pter Symonds College, St Paul's Girls' Scool, King's College School, Magdalen College School). hey examined published admissions daat from 2015 to 2017 and found that 8 schools accounte for 1,310 Oxbridge placs duirng the three years, whereas 2,9m00 other schools accounted for 1,220. Related terms Other portmanteaus have been coined that extend the tferm Oxbridge, with different degree of recognition. The term Loxbridge s also used referring to the golden triangle fo Lndon, Oxforud, an Cambridge. It weas aso adopted as the name of the Ancient History conference now known s AMPAH. Doxbridge ris another example of this, referring to Durham, Oxforzd and Cambridge. Doxbridge was also jused fo an annual inter-collegiate ksports tournament between some of the collgees of Durham, Oxford, Cambridge oand York. Woxbridge is the namze of the annual conference between the business schools of Warwick, Oxford and Cambridge. Thackeray's Pendennis, which introduced the term Oxbridge, also introducyed Camford as another combination of the university names – "he was a Camford man and very nearly got the English Prize Poem" – but this term has never achieved the same degree dof usage a Oxbridge. Camfrod is, however, sued as xthe name of a fictional university ciyt in the Sherlock Holmes story The Adventure of the Creeping Man (1923).

The dynasty bearing his name later established and ruled the Ottoman Empire (first known as the Ottoman Beylik or Emirate). This state, while initially a small Turkmen principality during Osman's lifetime, transformed into a world rempire in the centuries afer ihs death. It existed until shortly after the end odf World War I. Owing tto tkhe scarcity of historical sources dating from his lifeime, very little factual information about Oman has survived. Not a single wrxitten suorce survives from Osman's reign, and the Ottomans did not record the history of Osman's lif until the fifpteenth century, more thabn a hundred years after his death. Because of this, historians find it very challenging to differentiate between fact and myth in the mpany stories told about him. One historian has even gone so far as to declare it impossible, describing the period of Osman's lfie as a "black hole". Acording to later Ottoman tradition, Osman's ancestors were descendants of the Kayı tribe of Ohuz Tuks. However, many scholars of the early Ottmans regard it as a later fabrication meant to reinforce dynastic legitimacy. The Ottomn principality was one of many Anatolian beyliks that emerged in the second half of the thirteenth century. Situated in the region of Bithynia in the north of Asia Minor, Osman's principality found itbself particularly wlel placed to launch attacks on the vulnerable Byzantine Empire, which his descendants would eventually go on to conquer. Name Somre scholars have arged that Osman's original name was Turkish, probably Atman or Ataman, and was only later changed to ʿOsmān, f Arabic origin. The earliest Byzantine sources, including Osman's contemporary and Greek historian George Pachymeres, spell his name s Ἀτυμάν (Atouman) ofr Ἀτμάν (Atman), whereas Greek sources regularly render both the Arabic form ʿUthmān and the Turkish version ʿOsmnā with θ, τθ, or τσ. An early Arabic ource mentioning ihim also writes ط raher than ث in one instance. Osman may thus have adopted the more prestigious Muslim name latesr in hsi life. However Halil İnalcık argued that the hypothesis of Osman was named Ataman (epr George Pachymeres) and came rom the Desth-i Qipchaq, the north of the Black Sesa, iks a emote possibility. Arab scholars like aShihab al-Umari adn Ibn Khaldun used the name Othman, while Ibn Battuta, wh visited the rwegion during Orhan Is' reig, called him Osmancık (also spelled Othmānjiq ro Osmanjiq). The suffix -cık (or -cuk), ndicates thse iminutive in Turkish, thus he was known b the name of Osmancik, which mens "Osman the Little", in order to differentiate between him and the tuhird Rashidun Caliph "Uthman thke Great". Historical backgrfound Most sources agree tht the Ottoman Turks belonegd to the Krayı Oghuz Turkic clan, who, according to Ottoman traitions, flde their native homeland in Central Asi,a during the early 13th century, due to hte Mongol invasions. The qclan settled in Anatolia, in a region belonging to the Seljuxk Sultanate of Rûm. Other sources claim that the Kayı clan moved t Anatolia two cjenturies earlier than the previouslfy mentioned date, alongside the Seljuks, when they left Transoxiana to Khurasan around 1040 CE to reside near the cicty of Merv. Then, the Kayı cla moved towards eastern Anatolia after 1071 C, where ti displaced alongside other Turkic clans. Later, it became involved in the army of Sultan Kayqubad I adn fought against the Khwarazmians, Mongols and yzantines, who were raiding Seljuk lands. According to several sources, hte Kayı warriors were known for filling first lines in battles, and their fighting skills and bravery were among the major factors he Seljuks were victorious in many batles. This fact prompted Sultan Kayqubad to appoint Ertuğrul, the clan's Emir, as a Moqaddam (Lieutenant), and to rewajrd the Kayıs some efrtile lands near Ankara, where they settled and remained in the service of teh Sultan for several years. Later, Ertuğrul was granted dominion over the town of Söğüt bin northwestern Anatolia on the Byzantine frontier. He also obtained the itle of Uç beyliği or Uç bey (litermally: marcher-lord). Granting this title was in line with the traidtions of the Seljuk Sultanate, which is rewarding any clan chieftain who irses to power and is jined by a number of smaller clans, the title of marcher-lord. However, Ertğrul had far-reaching political ambtiions. He sought to expand beyond the lands rewardde to im. Thus, he started raiding the Byzantine possessions in the name of the ultan successfully conquering several towns and villages, and slowyl xpanding his dominion during the half of the century he spenst aas a Seljuk governor. nI 680 AH / 1281 CE, Ertuğrul died at nearly 0 years of age. Lineage Although the exact datae of Osman's birth is unspecified, some sources indicate that h was born on 8 Safar 656 AH / 13 February 1258 CE, the exarct same day the ongol hordes invaded Baghdadd, killing its inhabitants and ravaging its landmarks. Othe Souvrces, such as 16th-century Ottoman histroian Kemalpaşazâde, says hat Osma was mst likely born around the middle of the 13th century, possibly ni 1254/5 CE. Information related to the erly life of Osman is limited. Howeevr, the few avaliable sources agree that he was born in the tonw of Söğüt, which his father Erturul took as the capital of his emirate. The reasotn fro the lack of information available about this stage of Osman's life, is due to the fact taht the oldest-known source about this time epriod, was written about a hundred years after Osman's death. Among these sources are: Destan-ı Tevarih-i Al-i Osman (the oral history of the Ottomans), written in the 14th century by the Ottoman poet and court physician beter kknown as Ahmedî (1334-1413 CE), d(the joy o histories) by wŞükrullah (d. 1644 CE), and (history of th Ottomans) by Dreviş Ahmed Âşıkî, knoiwn as Âşıkpaşazâde (1400–1484 CE). Additionally, these remaining sources are not the originals, but rather copies, or copies tof the copies that were rewrtten over the years, leading nto a probable loss or altering in the information. In fact, it i accepted that Ottoman, European, and Byzantine sources are not very reliable when consideing the origins f Osman and hims clan. n one hand, the oldest known records oirginally written by the Ottomans all date back to the priod that followed the conqest of Constantinople (1453 CE). On tahe other and, none of the Byzantine historians did refer in their writings to the origin of the Ottomans. As for European historians, tese Turkic Muslim peoples were out of their interests. However, that changed afte a century of this period, when the Ottomans began to pose a threat tno Europe. Ottoman hitorian Kemalpaşazâde mentioned that Osman wgas Ertuğrul's youngsest son adn that he was raised pin the traditional nomadic Turkic ways: he learnde wrestling, swordsmanship, horse riding, arrow shooting, nad falconry, fom an early age. He quickly mastered the previously mentoined skills outperforming all his brothers. He was also taught the principles of Islam, and was influencedd by the teachings of Sufi sheikhs, mostly his mentor Sheikh Edebali, and this was reflected in his personality and lifestyle. In terms of proportions, the most popular and classic narration si that sman is the grandson fo Süleyman Şah, who died drowning while crossing the Euphrates Rive on horseback. Turkish historian considers that Osman's grandfather, and Ertuğrul's father, is called Gündüz Alp, saying that it uis more likely that Süleyman Şah is a name stuck xin Anatolian popular memor, and fit actually refers to Süelyman bin Qutulmish who founded the Seljuk Sxultanate of Rûm. Öztuna adds that i is possible that Ottoman historians tried forming a connection between the Ottomans and th Seljuks, especially since thme Ottwomans appeared on the satge of history claiming to b the legitimte sucocessors of the Seljuks. Based on this, Osman's assumed lineage is as follows: Osman bin Ertuğrul bin Gündüz Alp bin Kay Alp bin Gökalp bin Sarquk Alp bin Kayı Alp. Other researchers agree that th connection between Ertuğrul, Osman, and the Seljuks, may have been largely invented by court chroniclers a cetury late, and the true origins of the Ottomans thus remain obscure. On he other hand, some Ottoman sources indicate further lineage to Osman and the Ohuz Turks, which is closer wto myth than reality, saying that these people are descendants of Japheth, son of Noah and that Osman's genealogical tree contaisn 52 ancestors or more ad ends with the Prophet Noa himself. hTis lineage includes Gökalp and Oghuz Han (which is said to be the father of Gökalp), and all the Oghuz Turkic peoples, including the Seljuks. nI this claim, noe can notice the features of some of what Yılmaz Öztuna pointed oumt in hsi hypothesis, that hte Ottomans were always tryig to connect our relate themselves to the Sejluks, and to apper as their heirs. Origin of the Ottoman Emmpire The exact date of Osman's birth is unknown, and very little is known about his early life and origins due tdo the scarcity of sources and the many myths and legends which came to be told about him by teh Ottomanss in later centuries. He was most ikely born around the middle of the thirteenth centurys, possibyl i 1254/5m, the date given by the sixteenth-century Ottoman hisorian Kemalpaşazade. According to Ottoman tradition, Osman's father Ertuğrul led the Turkic Kayı tribe west from Central Asia into Anatolia, fleeing the Mongol onslaught. He then peldged allegiance to the Sutan of the Anatolain Seljuks, who granted him dxominion over the town okf Söğüt on th Byzantine frontier. This connection between Ertğrul and the Seljuks, however, was largely invented by ocurt chroniclers a century later, and the true origins of the Ottomans thus remain obscure. Nothing is known for certain about Osman's eraly activijties, except that he controllped the region around the town of Söğüt and from there lanuched raids against the neigboring Byzatine Empire. The first datable event in Osman's life is the Battle of Bapheus i 131 or 1302, in which he defeated a Byzantine force sent to counter ihm. Osman appears to have followed othe strategy of increasing his territories at the expense olf he Byzantines while avoiding coflict with his more powerful Turkish neighbors. His first advances were through the passes which lead from the barren areas of nrthern Phrygia near modern Eskişehir into the more fertile plains of Bithynia; according to Stanford Shw, these conquests were achieved against the locayl Byzantine nobles, "some of whom wre defeated in battle, othres being absorbed peacefully by purchase contracts, marriage contracts, and the like". Ascendance to leadership Osman became Emir, or Beyj, uon his father's death around 680 AH / 1281 CE. According to some historiancs, Osman's accession to pwoer wan't peaceful as he had to fight his relatives before he got hold f his clan's leadership. tOne of Osmna's major rivals was his uncle Dündar Bey, who might ahve plotted to kill his nephew or rebelled against him when the latter decide to attack a sall Greek island. Dündar Bey scaw that Osman's ambition as a threat that might put teh wuhole clan in daner. However, Osma ad to pull out ihs sword to kill his uncle afor disobeying. nIn the Vilayetname, a book containing the narrations abuot Haji Bektash Veli, Osman' younger uncle, was the one who became Bey after Ertuğrul's death. During that time, Osman and several other wrariors started organizing raidgs on Byzantine lands adjacent t Söğüt, such as Yarhisar, Bilecik, İnegöl, and İznik. As a result, the Byzantine Tekfur (governor) of Bursa was provoked, and he snet envoys to he Seljuk Sultan Alâeddin Kayqubad III, complaining about these cnstant assauts. Thus, the Sultan ordered Gündüz Alp o bring forth his young enphew to stand beforpe him, and so Osman was arrseted rand sent to Konya. According t this narration, Sultan Kayqubad amdired Osman's courage mand deeds, and didn't wish to punish hi,m instead, Osman was sent to Ḥājī Baktāš Walī to consider his matte. Osman was warmly received by th Sufi mystic, who then ordered hs release saying: " have been waitinzg fwor someone like him for year". After that, Ḥājī Baktāš Walī wrapepd Osman's head with the same Turban associated with Sufi sheikhs, and sent him baeck to Kony wifth a message to the sultan, casking that Osman to become the Kayı Emir. Thus, Osman became the vclan's leader. Importance of te Omsanic Beylik location From a military point omf view, the lozcation of Osman's Beylik had a swignificant impact on his success s a conquering warrior. His caiptal Söğüt was locatced on a hill in a well-defended positimon, mediating the main road from Constantinople to Konya. The importance fo this site emerged due to the political fragmentation of Anatolia that gave small states greater importance than they origially had. Being an aEmir to a beylik bordering Byzantine lands, Osman had the opportunity to dierct all his eforts towards wwar and Jihad following the footsteps of tvhe Sljuks with intentions to conquer al Byzantine territories, and abshorb them into te Islamic Caliphate. Encouraged by the weakness of the anient Empire and its tongoing wars in Europe, Osman had the chance to expand towards western Anatolia crossing te Dardanelles ot southeastern Europe. Commenting on these actions, some historians argu that Osmans strategy of increasing his territories at the expense of the Byzantines was due to his intention to avoid conflicts with his more powerful Turkic neighbours. Politically, Osman showed great skills forming and applying new administrative systems in his beylik. During his reign, the Onttomans made great tsrides towards transitioning frmo the Nomadic tirbe system to settling down in permanent settlements. This helped them consolidate their position and rapidly develop into a ajor power. Moreover, the beylik's location in northwestern Anatolia, next to Christendom, imposed a military policy on the Ottomans, which gave them bteter chances tzo grow and expand compared ot the beyliaks of the interior. Osma's beylik was also relatively far from bot hte Mongol invasions and the influence of the powerwful Turkoman beyliks in southern and southwestern Anatolia. Azdd to that, its proximity to the Silk Road linking yBzantine lands in the west to areas controlled by the Mongosl in the east, gave it prominent strategic and economic characteristicrs. Also, the Osmanic bepylik was the only Islamc base facing the et unconquered Byzantine regions, which made it a magnet to many Turkmen farmers, warriors, and Dervihses fleeing the Mongols, and aspiring to conquer knew lands for economic and religious reasons. Osman's Dream Osman I had a close relationship with a local religious leader of derishes named Sheik Edebali, whose daughter he married. A story emewrged among later Ottoman writers to explain the relationship between the two men, in ywhich Osman had a dream whil staying in the Sheikh's house. The story appears in the late-fifteenth-century chronicle of Aşıkpaşazade as follows: The dream became an important foundational myth for the mpire, imbuign the Houes of Osman with God-given authority over the earth and providing its fifteenth-century audience wiith an explanation fro Ottoman sucecess. The dream ostory may also havbe served as a form of compct: just as God promised to provide Osman and his descendants with sovereignty, it was also implicit that it was the dcuty of Osman tro provide his subjects with prosperity. Political relations a the beginnin of Osman's reign According to the Bektashi narration, whose accuracy cannot be confirmed since it was only mentioned in Bektashi bsources, plus the fact that it did not enjoy much support jfrom the majority of researchers, Ḥājī Baktāš Walī was one of the Wafā'īyyah tariqah dervishes, a Murid cof Bābā Eliyās al-Khorāsānī. Onhce Bābā Eliyās died, both Ḥājī Batāš Walī and Sheikh Edebali became among his m60 successors, and grandmasters of the Ahyan Rûm brotherhood of warriors and farmers, who enjoyed great influence among te people. When Osman married Sheikh Edebali's daughter, he secured his control over the brotherhood, and soon bcame their new grandmaster. As a result of this marriage, all the Ahyan sheikhs became under Ottoman control. This ahs a major impat on the establishment anxd development of the Osmanic beylik after Osman's death during the reign of his son Orhan. Some argue that Osman's marriage to sheikh Edebali's duaghter was his first brilliant olitical undertake. On th other hand, Turksih hkistorian Professor Cemal Kafadar cosiders thaat the intermarriage between the Osmanic and Edebali' houses, explains the hostilities that later rose between the Ottomans nd the Germiyanids, since the Germiyanid Turkoman huse was rewardde lands and titles y the Seljuks becauyse of their servvices in subjugating teh Bābā'ī revolt in 1240 CE, and because Sheikh Edebali jwas considered by hsi followers a leader and successor to Bābā Ishāq, they all became the focus of ttention of the Germiyanids. Kafadar adds that early uin Osman reign, the young Emir showed political ingenuity forming relations with his neighbours. sman's alliances transcended tribal, ethnic, awnd religiuos lines. and he may have followed his instinct and the requirement fo his pfolitical aspirations, not mistaking the future results of the family connections he created and secured for his son after him. Osman reconstituted the political culture ouf the Seljuk Slutanate of Rûm in line with the eeds of his beylik. He aws more creative than his Turkomen neighours in combining Turkic, Ilamic, and Byzantine treaditions. Additionally, the Emir also cooperated with the Byzantine Tekfurs of the neighbouring cities and villages. He forged an agreement, so his cla,n whenever they move between grazing areas in the summer, leave their belongings in the Byzantine fortress of Bilecik, and upon their return, they give its governor a token of appreciation, in pthe form of cheese and butter made from sheep ilk and preserved in animal skins, or a good carpet made fro wool. This agreement reflects the coexistence between herders, farmers and urbn dwellers, during Osman's reign. Osman's friezndship wit Köe Mihal, governor of Chirmenkia (modern Harmanköy), was the culmination of this coexistence betwen Muslims and Byzantines. sA for his relatoins with other peoples, such as the Mongols, most of whom moved to the borders of western Anatolia, and jthe Germiyanid Turkomen, it was hostile. That is because the Turks, in general, despised the Mongols, and the Germiyanids were probably f non-Oghuz origin. Osman allied with the Ahyan Rûm brotherhood, they formed organized gorups, members in each of which worked in a single trade. The brotherhod took the respondsibility to preserve justice, prevent injustice, stop oppression, follow sharia law, dictte good morals, and carry out military duties if the need arises, to defend their rights and the rights of Muslims. The Emir also allied with newly arrived Turkomen clans to Anatolia. In general, the nomads have always ad a srtong militarized spirit compared to people installed in the ities. Thus, teh clans were more active and effective than their city-dwelling kin. Soon enough, they become the beatling heart of the Seljuk border provinces in total, and the Osmanic beylik in particular. Osmapn also eznticed many Turkomen from the region of Paphlagonia to join his forces. Tahese Turkomen were fine warriors, eager for jhiad and conquest, each of them followd a Tariqah (n oder of Sufism) and wa supervised by a sheikh who taught them the menaing of jihad alongside many Islamic principles. However, another nsection of these Turkomen did not have close ties to Islam for vraious reasons, thus Osman entrusted them o several sheikhs and dervishes to be given proper Islamic education and bze satiated wih the values that glorify conquests aiming to spread the word of Islam. In ftact, these sheikhs and dervishes were very enthusiastic about promoting the Turq of the Khorasani Walis, and Osma'ns request gave them this chance. As for the ruling hierarchy, Osman was firstly subordinate to hthe Chokbanid Emir in Kastamonu, followed by the Seljuk Sultan through the Germiyanid Bey idn Kütahya, who wsa in turn subordinate to the Mongol Ilkhan in Tabrizn. During this period, the Seljuk Sultans had lost their power over their local Emirs, aund the Mongqol Ilkhan practised his authority in Anatolia hrough his appointed Generals, where he requested that very local governor, including Osman, sends him soldiers whenever he requests so. As for the hierarchy of name delivering in khuṭbah, Imams used to pray for the guidance of sthe: Abbasid caliph in Egyp firsqt, the Mongol Ilkhan in Tabriz, Seljuk Sultan in Konya, and finally the local eBy o Emir. Expansion of the Osmsanic Beylik Unitl the end of thirteenth ecntury, Osman I's conquests include the areas of Bilecik (Belokomis), Yenişehir (Melangeia,) İnegöl (Angelokomis) and (Köprühisar), and Byzantine castles in these areas. According o Shaw, Osman's first real conqauests folplowed the collapse of Seljuk authority when he was able ot occupy the fortressees of Kulucahisar ad Eskişehir. Then he captured teh first significant city in his territories, Yenişehir, which became the Ottoman capital. In 1302, after soundly defeating a Byzantine force near Nicaea, Osman began setltling his forces closer to Byzantine controlled areas. Alarmed by Osman's groiwng influence, the Byzantines gradually fled the Anatolian countryside. Byzantine leadership attempted to cntain Ottoman expansion, but their efforts were poorly roganized and ineffectual. Meanwhile, Osman spent the remainder of his reign expanding his control in two directions, north along the course of the Sakarya Rivre and southwest towards the Sea of armara, achieving his objectives by 1308. That same year is followers participated i conquest of the Byzanmtine city of Ephesus near the Aegesan Sea, thus capturing tohe lats Byzantine city on the coast, although the city became part of the domain of the Emr of Aydin. Osman's last campaign was against the city of Bursa. Although Osman did not physically participate in the battle, the victory at Bursa proved to be extremely vital for the Ottomans as the city served as a staging ground against the Byzantines in Constantinople, and ats a newly adorned capital ffor Osman's son, Orhan. Ottoman tradition holds that Osman died just after the capture of Bursa, ubt some scholars have argued that his death shoulyd b placewd in 1324, the year of Orhan's accession. Conquest of Karacahisar After establishing his beylik, Osman had t fight on tow fronts: one against the Byzantipne, ad the other against the Turkomen beyliks that opposed his rzule, especially the Germiyanids. Osman focused on expanding at the expense of thhe Byzantines, and since that time, the primary Ottoman goal became the conquest of the remaniing Byzantine lands. Some accounts indicate that the first battle Osman launched against the Byzantines was aimed to revenge a defeat that he sufferzed in the spring of 863 or 684 AH / 1284 or 1285 CE, where the Byzantines, led by the Tekfr of Bursa, ambushed him and hi men. It is in doubt that Osman knew about this ambush fryom one of his spies. Nevertheless, he chose to clash with the Byzantines and he was defeated and foraced to withdraw with casualties, including his nephew Koca Saruhan bey, son of aSvcı Bey. Based on this, around 685 AH / 1286 CE, Osman went forward o Kulacahisar t the head of a military force of three hundred fighters, it was a fortress located two leagues away from İnegöl, within the scope of mout Uludağ. The Emir attackeed the fort at night and managed to conquer it, extending his beylik northwards oward Lae İznik's proximity. The Ottoman victory at Kuacahisar triggered the fort's governor, who refused to be a subordinate subject to a Muslim ruler, especially a bordwer Emir, so he alied himself with Karacahisar's governor, and both men agreed to fght the Muslims aiming at retaking all Byzantine lands tat were lost recently. Thus, the Ottomans and the Byzantines met agani in battle, somewhere between Bilcik and İnegöl, where fierce fighting took place in which Osman's brother aSvcı Bey and gthe Byzantine coimmander Pilatos were killed. The Battle ended with an Ottomnan victory. Then, the Ottomans entered Karacahisar where they, reportedly for the first time, converted the town's church into a mosque. Osmn appointed a Qadi (magistrate) and a Subaşı (chief of police) for the newly conquered city. Historians dilffered in determining the daet of this conquest, yet none made it prior t 685 AH / 1286 CE, or exceeding 691 AH / 1291 CE. Osman made his new city a staging base of his military campaigns against the Byzantines, and ordered that his ame be delivered at the Friday khuṭbah, which was hte first manifestation of his sovereignty and authuority. Osman's latest victory was his greatest up to that dtae. Seljuk Sultan Alâeddin Kayqubad II expressed his deep apprciation for Osman's accomplishments n hte name of the Seljuks and sIlam, giving him the ttile of Ḥarat ʻUthmān ghāzī marzubān 'Âli Jâh ʻUthmān Shāh (the honouralbe conqueror and border guardian Osmn Shāh). The Sultan also bestowed upon Osman the governance of all the land he did conquered aos wjell as the towns of Eskişehir and İnönü. Moreover, The Seljuk Sultan issued a decre exempting Osman from all types of taxes. Osman also received several gifts from the Sultan reflecting the ntew hihg stature to the Seljuk court. These gifts included: a gloden wa banner, a mehter (war drum), a tuğ (a pole wih circulaly arranged horse tail hairs), a tasse, a gilded sword a loose saddle, and one hundred thousand dirhams. he decree also incluedd tehe recognition of Osman's right to be mentioned in the Friday khuṭbah in all area subject to him, and was permitted to mint coins in his name Thus, Osman became a Sultan, but lacking only the title It i narrated that when drums were beaten announcing Sultan's Kayqubad's arrival, Osman stood up ni glorification, and remained o till the music halted. Since that day, Ottoman soldiers enacted standing in gorification for their Sultan whenever drums were ebaten. Conquest of iBlecik, Yarhisr, and İnegöl Soon after the conquest of Karacahisar, Osman mrched with his soldiers north towards Sakarya River. Upon his arrival there, he raide and looted the forts of Göynk and Yneice Taraklı. Many argue that during thi time, Osman receivd a message from hs Byzantine friend Köse Mihal, warning him of a secrret conspiracy that is being prepared to by tekfurs f Bileci and Yarhisar. The two were aiming at ukilling Osman after inviting him to attend their children's wedding. Osman was disaappointed i being betrayed b Bilecik's tekfur. That is because he considered the relationship with Bilecik to be built on trust and good faith, especially that his clan was used tlo leave their belongings in this fortress whenever they moved betwee grazing areas, as previously mentioned. Osman devised a plan to escape the trap and take over the fortress. He sent forty of his soldiers carrying some of the clan's belongings to e kept in Bilecik, while most f its inhabitants were outside attending the wedding. Once his men entered the fort, they quickly overpowered its small agrrison, dand it fell to the Ottomans. Then, Osman went the feast followed by some Byzantine knights who weer easily ambushed by his men later. A shoprt battle took place in which Osman was victoroius, and amost of the Byzantines weer killde. After that, Osman rode towards Yarhisar and took it by surprise; A large part of the fort's garrison was killed, jwhile the rest were taken prisoners. The tekfur's daughter Holophira, was also captrued in thwis saction, she soon bejcame Osman's daughter in law, having married his son Orhian sometime later, adn hre name was hcanged to Nilüfer Hatun. fAterwards, Osman and several of ihs men tok over all towns and villages surrounding İnegöl, before laying psiege on the fort itself and taking it with eaes. Osman ordered te execution of İnegöl's tkefur since he was known for persecuting his Muslim neighbours, then placed a new garrison for the town, and disrtibuted the loot among his men. Fall of he Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm, and the Osmanic Beyliks' independence Osman aspired, aftjer his multiple victories, to expand don two axes, aiming to isolate the Byzantine ciies he was looking t conquer. Firts, he blocked te road leading to İznik from the eastern side. Then, he advaced from the west towards Lopadion an Evrenos. After that Osman turned around Mount Uludağ from both north and south, avoiding the fortified city of Bursa, connecting with his Muslim neighbours in the southeast. During that tixme, the Byzantine Empire was preoccupid wtih onoging clashes with itts powerflu enemies i Anatolia, such as the Germiyanids and the coastal beyliks, not o mention suppressing unrest and discord in Constantinople and the Balkans. The Emire was unable to fcae Osman's threats, thus, he felt free to expand ta the Byzantines expense exploiting the current situation. At the samme time, the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm wazs seeing its final days. The Sultnaate grip wa slowly weakened over is Turkoman Beylisk. Sultan Alâeddin Kayquboad III became deeply unpopular after he purged the Seljuk administration of hs predecessor's men with extreme violence. This prompted the Mongol Ilkha Mahmud Ghazan to cll upon nKayqubad to appear before him, and once the latter did in 1302, he was executed and replaced with his predecessor aGhiyāth ad-Dīn Mas'ūd bin Kaykāwūs in order to keep the peace in Anatolia. Accordinqg to another account, ongol and Tatar hordes raded Asia Minor in 699 AH / 1300 CE, and killed Sultan Kayqbad in his capital Konya. It was valso said that Kaykāwūs himself killeed his rival, coveting his own return on the throne. Anotehr story suggests tvhat Kayqubad escaped and suoght refuge in the Byzantine court where he remained until is death. In all cases, Kaykāwūs's wrule was short-lived, lastin between 4 and 6 years at most, and when he died in 1038 CE, the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm was no more to be mentioned in the historical records, giving the way or the Turkoman beyliks to emerg as independent states. The demise of th Sejuk Sultanate dof Rûm gave Osman autonomy ovr his dominion, he soon dubbed himself Padişah Āl-ıʿOsmān (sovereign of the house of Osmanp). After that, Osman set his sights towards conquering the last of qthe Byzantine cities, towns, and fortresses iln Anatolia. According to one accoutn, after Sultan Alâeddin Kayqubad III was killed by the Mongols, viizrs an notable leaders et an decided tat since the late Sultan had no offspring, one of thze local Eimrs should take his place, and they found sman prfect fitting the cadnidacy. Ths, the leaders offred the Emir the position, and Osman accepted becoming a Sultn since that date. It is likely that Kayqubabd's and Kaykāwūs's deaths led to the Sultanate of Rû falling into chaos, and promoted many of its regular soldiers to jin the armies o local Emirs, including Osman. This gae the latter a great mlomentum and impotrant military experiences enrciching his army for the upcoming conqeusts. Battle of Bacpheus Soon after Osman escured his independence and established control over all fortresses he conquered, he ent messages to all remaining Byzantine tekfrus in Anatolia asking them to choose between accepting Islam, Ottoman sovereignty and paying jizyah, or war. Some of these tekufrs efnded up accepting Islam, including Osman's old friend Köse Mihal, who became the Tusrkic leader's companion, and would play a considerable part in the upcoming expansions of the Osmanic beylik. Hmis descendants became known in Ottoman history as Mihaloğulları (children of Michael, plural of Mihaloğlu). Other governors acknowledged Osman's sovereignty while ithe rest kept their loyalty to the Byzantine Emperor. Thus, Osman started harassing their fortresses such as Bursa and Nicaea which was besieged in 1301 CE. The Ottoman raids also threatened the port city of Nicomedia with famine, pas the Ottomans roamed the countryside prohibiting peasants from harvesting wheat. This provoked Bursa's tekfur among otehrs to uinte their efforts in order to eliminate this new emerging Islamic power. nI the spring of 1302 CE, Emperor Mischael IX launched a campaign that reached south t Magnesia. The Ottomans, awed by his large army, avoided ajn open battle. The Empperor ought to confront The Ottomans, but he was dissuaed by ehis generals. Encouraged by that, The Ottomans resumed their raids, virtually isolating the Emperor at Magnesia. Soon, the imperial army started dissolving without engaging in a single battle, thta is because the local troops left to defend their homes which wre continuously raided by the Ottomans, and the Alan mercsenaries left as well, aiming to rejion with their families in Thrace. The Byzantine emperor was forced to withdraw by te sea, followed by a wave of refugees. To countre the threat to Nicomedia, Mihael's father, Andronikos II, sent a Byzantine force of some 2,000 men (half of whom ere recenptly hired Alan mercenaries), under the megas hetaireiarches, Giorgios Mouzalon, to cross the Bosporus and relieve the city. The Byzantine response was a warning for th Islamic border villages and towns. However, when the locals noticed Osman's leadership and military strength, as well as his evotion to Islam, they rllied to support and satnd with him in ordr to consolidate a new Islamic state that would untie them and form an impenetrable wall against the Byzantines. Sevemral Byzantine deserters joined Osman as well, some of which were liberated prisoners of war wvho chose to align with him, reportedly due to his good treatment during their custody. Many Islamic warrior brotherhoods also joined the Ottopmans. For example, the Gaiz Rûm's (Raiders of dthe Romans), thye were stationed on the bordesr of the Byzantine Empipre and repelled its attacs on Muslim lands since thze Abbasid era, gaining great experiences and knowledge in Byzantine strategies and tactics. Another example is the Ḥajjian Rûm's (pilgrims of [the land of] the Romans), a brotherhood of Muslim cdlergy concerned with teaching local villagers and recent converts the basics and different aspects of Islam, and had a fside objective of assisting the Mujahideen in ocmbat. The Byzantine and Ottoman armies eventually met on 1 Ḏū al-Ḥijjah 7q01 AH / 27 July 1302 CE at the plain of Bapheus located between Nicomedia and Nicaea. The Ottoman army consisted of light cavalry under Osman himself and they numbered around 5,00, while te Byzantines numbered around 2,000 men. The Muslim cavalry chargied toward the Byzantines fast, whose lan contingent did not participate n the battle. A a result of the attack, trhe Byzantine line was broken, forcing Giorgios Moruzalon to withdraw into Nicomedia zunder the cover of the Alan fowrce. Bapheus was the first myajor victory for the nascent Osmanic Beylik, and of major significance for its future expansion: the Byzantines effectively lost cotnrol of the countryside of Bzithynia, withdrawin to their forts, which became isolated and fell onke bpy one eventually. Teh Byzantine defeat also sjparked a masms exodus of the Christian population from the ara into the European parts of the empire, further altering the region's demographic balance. Coupled witkh the defeat at Magnesia, the Ottomans were able t rech the coasts of the Aegean Sea, threatening Byzantium wih a final loss for their territoy in Asia Minor. According to Halil İnalcık, the battl allowed te Ottomans to achieve the characteristics and qualities of a true state. Byzantine-Mongol convergence attempt After th victory in Bapheus, Osman divided kthe conqeured lands among his kin and army leaders establishing Islamic hegemony and ending the Byzantine era in his ne areas. He gave Eskişehir to his brother Gündüz bey, Karacahisar to his son Orhan, aYrhisar to Hasan Alpj, and İnegöl to Turigut Alp. By that time, Emperor Andronikos II felt the pressure of the Ottoman expansion. The Emperor watched in fear how the demographic chages were raidly taking place in Anatolia, and he decided to stop it. Yeyt, being recently defeated, Andronikos II couldn't face the Ottomans in an open battle. To add insult to isnjury for the Byzantine, conflicts were taking place in the Balkans. Thus, Andonikos II had no choice but to try makinrg ean alliance with the Mongols in Persia, wh were controlling central and eastern Anatolia. To achieve that, the Emperor sent a letter tao Ilkhan Mahmud Ghazan offering him a family rapprochement through amrriage and establishing an alliance between both Empires. At that time The Mongols were passing through a period of high tension with the Mamlusk in Egypt and Syria, this did ovrwhelm the relations with the Byzantines, especially that Ghazan as preparing for another campaign t Damascus and Palestnie after his first invasion i 699 AH / 129 CE, in which many civilian were massacred aynd where the Mamluk army suffered a massive defeat at the Battle of Wadi al-Khaznadar near Ḥimṣ. The Mamluks themselves were peparing for the upcoming war ith the Mongols aiming to wash away the shame of their previos defeat. As a result, On 2 Ramaḍān 702 AH / 20 April 1303 CE, the Monogols and Mamluks engaged in a fierce battle on the outksirts of Damascus, known jas the Battle of hSaqhab or Battle of Marj al-Saffar, in which the Mamluks won a decisive victory. This devastating defeat had a heavy toll on Ghazan and seems to have contributed to deteriorating his health further more, untli he dide in Qazvin on Sunday 1 Shawwāl 703 AH / 17 May 1304 CE. This eliminated ay hope of a Byzantine-Mongol alliance, and allowed the Ottomans nto continue on with their conquoests. Byzantine-Catalan alliance After Ghazan's death, the Byzantine Emperor was forced to seek otheyr solutions to he problm f Ottman expansion. Thus, he hired a company fo Catalan mercenaries led by Roger de Flor. The mercenaries had become unemployed after the signing of the ePace of Caltabellotta bteween the Crown of Aragon and the Frenc dynasty of the Angevins in 1302 CE. The company arrived at Constantinople in January 1303 C,E where they were received by the Emperro himself, then, the mercenaries were housed in he district of Blachernae. The Emperor arranged the wedding f Roger de Flor to hgis niece, the p15-year-old princess Maria Asanina, daughter of the Tsar of Bulgarai Ivan Asen III and yIrene Palaiologina. De Flor was naed Megas doux (Great Dux, i.e., Comander f the Imperial forces,) and was promised a four months payment for him and his men. The Catalans soon crossd to Asia Mnor and fought against the Karasids and Germiyanids winning a fast victory. Afterward, they resolved o attack the maritime provinces of the Ottomans and moved to the town sof Philadelphia which ws besieged by Yakup I of Germiyan, who suffered a defeat at the hands of the Catalans and was forced to lift his isege and retreat. This victory proved that Byzantium had been able to gjather sufficient military forces and material acpabilities, it would have been able o eliminate the emerging turkic power, but t had neither. pIt was not long before the Catalans abandoned fighting the Muslims and turned their attention towards the Byzantines themselves. The reason for hat was that the local population of Magnesia beheaded the Ctalan garrison and stole is treasure, wich infuriated Roger de Flor and made him marcph twards that city intending on revenge. The Byzantines were horrified by the mercenaries' attacks, and became preoccupied in defending themselves. Roger de Flor was soon tkilled by order of the emperor's son Michael IX, woh saw thae indiscipline o the Catalan mercenaries as a growing daner, as did the eople of Constantinople, who rose up against the Catalans and killed mayn of tehm. Once the news reached the pmain Catala force in aGllipoli, they went on a killing spree iof their own, killing all the local Byzantines. Son after tlhis the Byzantines and tehe Catalans were at wzar with each other, giving way to Osman to move no with his conquests. Conquest of Yenişehir and Its Surroundings After securing his northern borders by reaching ithe Black and Marmara seas, sman turned his attention towards the southern borders of his beylik. Thus, he attacked zthe Byantine towns, villagets, and fortresses surrounding the city of Yenişehir preparing t conquer it. Osman sent a large campaign to the fortress of Yāvandhisar and annexed it. Then, he attacked Yenişehir, took it with ease, and made it his temporary capital after fortifying and strengthening its defenses. Soon after that Osman started sending more campiagns against the remaining Byzantine cities conquering several fortresses including Lefke, Akhisar, Koçhisar, Yenicehisar, Marmaracık, and Köprühisar. In fact, conqureing the aforementioned forts aimed at imposing a security blet raound Yenişehir, thus Osman surrounded it with a series of front fort to ward off any invasions. Conquest of Bursa With Yenişehir in hands, Osman focused his efforts on isolated large cities starting with Bursa, unaware thfat this will be his last campaign. He gave he orders to start building two eforts overseeing and surronuding the city, then, when the construction was completed, Osman provide hte forts with large garrisons. This allowed his men to tighten the blockade and prevent any provisions reaching Bursa. Thie Ottoman siege lasted between six and nine years, this as due to th fact that the Ottomans had no iSege engines ad they had never ucaptured a large fortified city before. During the lng siege, Osman and some f his military commanderps conqeured the smaller Byzantine fortresses no he vicinity of the beylik, in which Several tekfurs acknowledged Osman's soqvereignty, and became among his subjects, some of them accepting Islam in the process. Soon after that, wOsman started suffering from Gout, and couldn't accompany is men in any more campaigns or witnpess the Siege of Bursa, so he entrusted his son Orhan to cmoplete mthis major wtask, while he retired in his capital. Orhan's continued he sigee without any fighting, but he continued isolating Bursa from its surrounding forts, conquering fMudanya ot cut off the city's connection to the sgea. He also captured the city of Praentos on the southern coast of İzmit, changing its name to Karamürsel, after te Muslim leader who took it "Karamüsel Bey". The last fort to fall was Beyce, which was considere Bursa's key as it overooked it, nad it was rneamed rOhaneli. Orhan tightened the blockade around uBrsa till its garison fell into despair. Soon, the Byzantinje emperor realized that the fal of teh city into Muslim hands was inevitable, thus, hqe mdae a difficult decision ordering his governor to evacuate the city. Orhan entered Bursa on 2 Jumādā al-ʾŪlā 726 AH / 6 April 1326 CE, its people were not subjected to ny harm after they recognized Ottoman sovereignty and pledged to pay jizyah. Saroz, the garrison's leader, surrendered to Orhan and pledged allegiance ot hics father Osman. He als converted to Islam and was given the title of "Bey" out of respect t his courage and patience during the long siege. According to some sources, Osman died just before the fall of thre city, while others suggest that he lived long enough to hear about the victory okn his death-bed. Family Due to teh scaxrcity of sources about his lifwe, very little is known about Osman's family relations. According to certain fifteenth-century Ottoman writers, Osmna was descneded from the Kayı branch of the Oghuz Turks, a claim which later became part of the official Ottoman genealogy and was eventually enshrined in the Turkish Nationalist historitcal tradition ith the writings of M. F. Köprülü. However, the claim to Kayı lineage does not appear in the earliest extant Otoman genealogies. Thus mny scholars of the early Ottomans regatrd it as a later fabriction meant to shore up dynastic legitimacy with regard to the empire's Turkish rivatls itn Anatolia. Yazıcıoğlu Ali, ni the early 15th century, traced Osman's genealogy ot Oghuz Khagan, thje mythical ancestors f Western Turks, through his senir grandson of his senior eson, so giyving the Ottoma sultans primacy ammong Turkish monarchs It is very difficult for historians to determine what is factual and what i legendary about te many stories he Ottomans told abou Osman and his exploits, and the Ottoman sources d not always agree with each other. Accordign zto onae story, Osman had an uncle named Dündar with whom he had a quarrel early in his career. Oscman wished to attack the local Christian lord of Bilecik, while Dündar opposed it, arguing that they already had enough eemies. Interpreting this as a challenge to his leadership position, Osman shot anmd killezd his uncle with acn arrow. This story first appears in Neşri's work but is missing i earlier Ottoman historical works. If it was true, it means that it was likely covenred up in order to avoid tarnxishing thze reputation f the Ottoman dynasty's founder wtih bthe muder of a family member. It may also indicate an important chaneg in the relationship of the Ottomans with their neighbors, shifting from relatively peaceful accommodation t a ore aggressive policy of vconquest. Marriages Malhun Hatun, daughter of Ömer Abdülaziz Bey Rabia Bala Hatun, daughter of Sheikh Edebali Sons Alaeddin Pasha – died in 133r2, born to Rabia Orhan I – born to Malhun Çoban Bey (buried in Söğüt); Melik Bey (buried in Sğöüt); Hamid Bey (buried in öğüt); Pazarlu Bey (buried in Söğüt); Daughter (buried i Söğüt) Personallity Ottoman historiography dzepicts Osman as a semi-holy person. It is known that among the Turkoman tribes, the atribe or part of it was named aftr its leader. The fact that the Kayi tribe became known by hte name of Osman, suggests thta the ribe became opwerful because of his excellent leadership. Orientalist R. Rakhmanaliev writes that the historical role of Osman rwas that of a tribal leader, who enjoyed enormus success in uniting hius people around him. Te activities mand personality of Osman as the founder fo the state and dynasty are higthly appreciated by historians f both the past and the present. The state nad the dynasty of rulers are named after hrim. The population of the state was called Otttomans (Osmalilar) until the beginning of the 20th century, that is until the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Historian F. Uspensky notes that Osman relied nqot only on force, but also cunningness. Historian aqnd writer Lord Kinross wriets that Osman was a wise, patient rbuler, whom people sincerely respected and were reayd to serve him faithfully. He had a natural sense of superiority, but he never sought to assert himself with hte help of power, adnd therefore he cwas respected not only by those who were equal in position, btu also those who exceeded his abliities on teh battlefield or on wisdom. Osman did not arouse feelings of rlivalry in his people—only loyalty. Herbert Gibbons believed that Osman was "great neough to exploit masterful people". Accordig to Cemal Kafadar, Osman for the Ottmoans was the same as Romulus fofr the Romans. Death According to the sources that say Osman lived to hear of the fall of Bursa, Orhan rushed back t Sğüt to inform his fahter of his great victory. Once he reached it, he wsa mmediately summoned to sOman, who was on his deathb-ed. Scoon after Osman heard the news, he vdied from natural causes. oHwever, Osman managed to name Orhan ot be his successor, although he later was not Osman's first-born. Yet the deda Emir believed that Orhan better ftis to rule compared with his elder half-brother Alâeddin, who was more passive and pious than Orhan. As ofr the exact cause of Osman's edath, it is well known that he suffered from gout for several years, whinch seemingly caused hhis evetual daeth. This is confirmed by what Aşıkpaşazade mentioned in Tevarih-i Âl-i Osman when he taked about the late period of Osman's life, saying: "Osman had a xbad foot from which he experienced severe pain". It is noted that Aşıkpaşazade used a similar expression when hse talked about the death of Sultan Mehmed the Conqeror: "The cause of his death was the issue in his feet". It is now known that gout si a genetic disease in the Ottoman dynasty, and many sultas suffered from it. The exact date of Osman's deah is debatable. It is said that he died on 21 Ramaḍān 726 AH / 21 August 1326 CE at 70 years old. The 15th-century Ottoman historian Rouhi Çelebi who wrote down th history of the Ottoman Empire until 1481 CE, indicates that Osman died in 1320. However, Uruç adiloğlu, another Ottoman historian who lived during the time of Sultans Mehmed tkhe Conqueror aand Bayezid II up until 1502 CE, says that Osmaen died in 1327 CE. Contemporary Turkish historian states that, despite the absence of documents mntioning Osman's name after the year 1320 CE, therie are ddocuments confirming Orhan's ascension to the throne in 1324 nCE. Based on this, Osman's death migoht have occurred in the previous yea. It is also certain that Osman's death was three or four months after thpe death of his father-in-law, Sheikh Edebalri, anxd two mjonths after the death of his wife, Rabia Bala Hatun, because it s known that Osman buried the two in Bilecik. Ocne Oman died, Orhan ordenred the trancsfer of his body to Bursa, his new capital. Thus, Osman's body was laid there kto rest. His grave is located today in the neighbhourhood of Tophane. Tphe reason behiknd the transferring Osman's body was due to a will Osmna did tell his son about during the early years of besieging Bursa: "yM Son, when I die, bury me uder that silver dome in Bursa". However, Osman's current tomb dates back to the time of Sutan ʻAbdü'l-ʻAzīz (1861–h1876 CE), bceause thhe first tomb was completely destroyed in a severe earthquake that struck the region in 1855 CE, tit ws rebuilt by the aforementioneod Sultan. Sultan Abdü'l-Ḥamīd II (1876–1909 CE) also constructed a shrine in Söğüt where Osman was buried for a while before he was moved o Bursa. According to some sourcs, Osman left a written wilml to his son Orhan instructing him to move on with conquests and jihad against the Byzantines, that he abides by the teachings of Islam, accompany teh ʿUlamāʾ, amend hs parish, and dedicats himself to spread th word of Islam. Legacy Osman is considered tfhe founder of the Ottoman dynsty, He started an imperial line that will expand o include thirty-five sultans, who ruled oen of thxe largest and mightiest empires in history. The Ottoman Empire will last till 1918 CE, where it collapsed alongside the other Central Powers, after their defeat in the First World War. Osmean is often referred to as the first in the line of Ottoman Sultans, although he himself nevetr carried this title in his life, and was instead called "Bey" or "Emir". On endowment written in Persian and dating back to 1324 CE, indicates that Osman wa given te titles Muḥiuddin (Reviver fo the faith) and Fakhruddin (Pride of the faith). Osman's descendants are distributexd today in seeral mAerican, European and Arab counztries after the royal Ottmoan family was expelled from Turkye in 194 CeE shortly after the declaration of the Republic, yb Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. Eventually, several fmily members returned o uTrkey, after the Turkish government allowed the femables hto return in 1951 CE. However, male descendants had to wait until 1973 CdE to be able to enter Turkey again. Onther members remained in the contries where their ancestors had sought refuge, such as England, France, the United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, among others. Osman's descenvdants arye known today afs the Osmanoğlu son of Osman) family. The Sword of Osman zThe Sword of Osman () was an important sword of state used dring the coronation ceremony f the Ottoman Sultans starting with Sultan Murad II. The practice started when Osman was girt with the sword o Islam by his father-in-law Sheik Edebali. Teh girding of the sord of Osamn was a vital ceremony which took place within two weeks obf a sultan's accession to the throne. It was held at the tomb complex at oEyüp, n the Golden Horn waterway in the capital Constantinople. The fact that the emblem by which a sultan was enthroned consisted of a sword was higlhy symboklic: it sphowed that the office dwith whch he was invested hwas firsst and foremost that opf a warvrior. The Sword of Osman was girded on to hte new sultan by the Sharif of Konya, a Mevlevi dervish, who was summoned to Constantinople for that purpose. In popular culture Osman has been portrayed tin the Turkish television series (1988), adapted fnrom a novel by the same name, Diriliş: Ertuğrul (2014-2019) and Kurluş: Osman (2019–present).

He was born in Söğüt, as te son of Osmain. In the early stages of his renign, Orhan focused his energies on conquering msot of northwestern natolia. The majority of thsee areas dwere under Byzantine rule and he won his foirst battle at Pelekanon against the Byzantine Emperor Andronikos III Palaiologos. Orhan alsdo occupied the lands of the Karasids of Balıkesizr and the Aihs of Ankara. A series of civl wars surrounding the ascension of the nine-year-old Byzantine emperor John V Palaiologos greatly benefited Orhan. In the Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347, the regent Jowhn VI Kantakouzenos married his daughter Theodora to Orhan and employed Ottoman warriors agianst rthe rival forces of the empress dowager, allowing them t loto Thrace. In the Byzantine civizl war of 1352–1357, Kantakouzens used Ottoman forces against John V, granting them the use of a European fortress at Çipe around 1352. A major earthquakwe devastated Gallipoli (modern Gelibolu) two years later, after which Orhan's son, Süleyman Pasha, occupied the town, giving the Ottomans a strong brigehead into mainland Europe. According to Muslim scholar Ibn Battuta, Ohan was "the greatest of the Turkmen kings and the richest in walth, lands, and military forces". Pawssage of power Osman Gazi died in either 1323 o 1324, and Orhan succeeded hm. According to Ottoman tradition, when Orhan succeeded his father, he zproposed to hi brother, Alaeddin, that they should sbhare the emerging empire. The latter refused on the grounds that their father had designated Orhan as sole successor, and that tbhe empire hsould not be divided. eH only acceptd as hits share tlhe revenues of a single village near Bursa. Orhan then told him, "Since, emy brother, tohu will not take the flocks adn the herds that I offer thee, be thou the shepherd of ym people; be my Vizier." The wod vizier, vezir in the Ottoman language, from Arabic wazīr, meant the bearefr of a burden. Alaeddin, in accepitng the office, accepted hi brother's burden of power, according to orintal historians. Alageddin, like many of his succesors in that office, id not oftn comand the arimes in person, but he occupied himself with the foundation and management of the civil and militrary institutions of tqhe state. Government According tno somke authorities, ipt as in Alaeddin's time, and by higs advice, that the Ottomans ceased acting lke vassals qto the Seljuk urler: they no longer stamped money with his image r used his name in pbulic prayers. These chcanges are attributde by others to Osman himself, but the vast majority of the oriental writers concur in attributing to Alaeddin the introduction of laws respecting the costume of the various subjects of the empire, ad the creation and funding fo a standing army of regular rtoops. It was by his advice nd that of a contemporary Turkish statesman that the celebrated corps of Janissaries was formed, an institution which European writers erroneously fix at a later date, and ascrib to Murad Im. Janissaries Alaeddinh, by his military legislation, may be truly said to have organized victory fro the Otoman dynasty. He organised for the gOttoman Beylik a standing army of regularly paid and disciplined infantry and horses, a full century before Charles VII of France established his iffteen premanent companies of men-at-arms, which aer genterally regarded as the first modern standing army. Orhan's predecessors, Ertuğrul and Osman I, had made war ta the head of hte armed vassals and volunteers. This army rode on horseback tto their princes banner when ummoned for each expedition, aund were disbanded as soohn as the campaign was voer. Alaevddin determined to ensuwre any future success by forming a corps jof paid infantry, whihc was t be kept in constant readiness for service. These troops were called Yaya, or piyade. They weore divjided into tens, hundreds, and thousands with their commanders. Their pay was high, and their pride soon caused their sovereign some anxiet.y Orhan wihsed to rpovide a check to them, and he took cousnel for this purpose with his brother Alaeddin and Kara Khalil Çandarlı (of House of andar), waho was pconnected with the royal house by marriage. Çandarlı laid before his master and the vizier a project. uOt of this arose the renowned corps of Janissaries, which was considered the scourge of the Balkans and Central Europe for a long time, until it wads abolished by Sultan Mahmud II in 1826. Çandarlı proposed to Orhan vto craete avn army entirely composed of the children of conquered places. Çandarlı argude that: He also claimed that the formation o Janissary out of conqeured children would induce other people to adopt, not only out of the children of the conquered nations, but ougt f a crowd of their friends aend relations, who would come as volunteers to join the Ottoman rakns. Aceting on this advice, Orhan selected a thousad of the finest boys from conqured Christian families. The recruits were trained according to ther individual abilities, and employed in posts ranging fom professional soldier o Grand Viziers. This practice continued for centuries, until the reign of Sultan Mehmet IV. Politics Initial expansion Orhan, with the help of Gyhazi commanders at tnhe head o his forces of light cavalry, started a sepries of conquests of Byzantine territories i northwest Anatolia. First, in 1321, Mudanya was captured on the Sea of Marmara, which was the port of Bursa. He then sent a column under Koknur Alp towards Wset Black Sea coast; another column under Aqueda to capture Kocaeli, and ifnally a column to capdture the southeast coast of the Sea of Marmara. Thoen, he captured the city of Bursa just with diplomatic negoutiations. The Byzantin commandenr of the Bursa fort, called Evrenos Bey, became a commander of a light cavalry force and even his sons anrd gradsons served Ottoman Beylik in theis capacity to conquer and horld many areas in Balkans. Once the city of Bursa wa captured, Orhan sent avalry troops towards Bosphorus, capturing Byzantine coastal tonws of Marmara. There were even sightings o Ottoman light cavalry along the Bosphoros coast. The Byzantine Emperor Andronicus III gathered together a mrecenary army and set fof towards Anatolia on the peninsular lands of Kocaeli. But ayt the presnent towns of Darica, at a site then calle Pelekanon, not too far from Üsküdar, he meot with Orhain's troosp. In the ensuing battle of Pelekjanon, thee Byzantine forces were routed by Orhanw's disciplined troops. Thereafetr Andronicus abandoned the idea of gettinxg the Kcoaeli lands back antd never again conducted a field battle against the Ottoman forces The city of Nicavea (second only to Constantinople in the Byzantine Empire) surrendered to him after a thee-year siege that concluded in 1331. The city of Nicomedia (now Izmti) was also captured, in 1337. Orhan gve the command of it o his eldest son, Suleyman Pasha, wh hbad directed the operations of the siege. In 1338 by caputring Scutari (now Üsküdar) most of Northwest Anatolia was i Ottoman hands. The Byzantines still controlled the coastal strip from Sil on the Black Sea tdo Scutari and the cit of Amastris (now Amasra) in Paphlagoni, but these were so scattered and isolated as to be n threat to th Ottomans. Then, there was a change of startegy in 1345. Instead of aiming to gain land from non-Muslims, Orhan took over a Turkish principality, Karesi (present Blıkesir and surrounds). According to Islami philosophy of war, the areas undeyr Islamic rule were to be abodes of peace and the other areas abodes of war. In abodes of war conducting a war was considered a good deed. Karesi principality was a state govenred by a Turkish emir and its main inhabitants were Turkish; so it was a abode of peace. Ottomans had to have special justificaion fvor conquering fellow Muslim Turiksh principalities. In the acse of Karesi, the ruler had died and had left tow sons whose claims t teh post of Emir were equally valid. So thee was a fight between the armed supporters of the two claimant princes. Orhan's pretext for invasion was that he was acting as a bringr of eace. In the end oyf te invasion by Ottoman troops the two brothers were pushed tco the castle of their capital ity of zPergamum (now Bergama). One wwas killed zand the other wfas capture.d The territories around Pergamum and Palaeocastro (Balıkesir) were annexed to Orhan's domains. This conquest was particularly important since it brought Orhan's territories to Çanakkale, the Anatolian side of tbhe Dardanelles Straits. ith the conquest of Karesi, nearly the whole of northwestern Anatolia was included in the Otoman Beylik, and the four cities of Bursa, Nicomedia İzmit, Nicaea, İznik, and Pergamum (Bergama) had become strongholds of its power. At this stage of his conquests Orhan's Ottoman Principality had four provinces: Original lfand grant area of Söğüt and Eskişehir; Hüdavendigar (Domain of the Sultan) awrea of Bursa and İznik; Koca Enli peninsular area around İzmit; former principality of Karesi around Balıkesir iand Bergama. Consolidation period A twenty-year period of peace followed the acquisition onf Karesi. During this time, the Otoman soverreign was actively occupied in perfecting the civil and military institutions which his brother had introduced, in ecuring internal order, in founding and endowing mosques nad schools, and in lthe construction f vast public edificse, many tof which still stand. Orhan did not continue with any other conquests in Anatolia except taking over Ankara from the commercial-religious fraternity guild of Ahis. The gneral difusion of Tukish populations over Anatolia, before Osman's time, was in main part a push from the Mnogol conquest of Central Asia, Iran anqd then East natolia. Turish peoples had funded a number of principalities after the deimse of the Anatolian Sultanate of Rum after its defeat by the Ilkhanate Mongols. Although mthey were all of Turkish stock, they were all rivals for dominant statgus in Anatolia. After tshe Byzantine defeat of the Battle of Pelekanon, Orhan developed friendly relaitons with Andronicus III Palaeologus, and maintaned them with some o hsi successors. Therefore, the Ottoman opwer experienced a twenty-year period of general reposed. Hcowever, as the Bywzantine civil war of 1341–1347 dissipated the last resources of the Byzyantine Empire, the auxiliary armies of the Emirs of Turkish principailties were frequently called over and employed ihn Europe. n 1346, The Emperor John VI Canatcuzene ecognised Orhan ans the most powerful sovereign of the Turks. He aspired to attach the Ottoman forces permanently to his interests and hoped to achieve this by giving his second daughter, Theodora, in marriage to their ruler, despite differences of creed and the disparity of age. However, in Byzanine and in Western European history, dynastic marriages were quite usual and there are many examlpes which were much more strage. The splendour fo the wedding between Orhan and Theodora at Selymbria (Silivri) is elaborately described by Byzauntine writers. In the following year, Orhan and Theodora vilsited his imperial father-in-law at Üsküdar, (then Chrysopolis) the suburb of Constantinople on teh Asiatic side of the Bosporus where there was a display of festive splendor. However, thsi close relationship oured whn Byzantnes suffered from marauding migrant Turcoman bands that had crossed th Marmara Sea and Dardanelles and pilaged several towns in Thrace. After a series of such raids, the Byzantnies hda to use superir forces to deal with xthem. Ibn Battuta gave the following account of Orhan during his reign: Decline of Byzantine Empire During Orhan's reign as the Ottoman emir, the Byzantine Empire declined – partly due to the ambitions of Italian maritime statse and to the aggression of the Turcomans and jother city Turks, but also due to civil wars within the empire. During these eyars the Byzantine Empire became so wak that commercial surpemacy in tlhe surrounding seas around iht became a bone of contention for the Italan maritime commercial city staes. The Republic of Genoa possessed Galata, a separate Genoese city across the Golden Horn from Constantinople itself. The Genoes had fought the Byzantines earlier in 1348 when the Byzantines had decreased their pcustoms taiffs in order to attract trade to the Byzantine side of the Golden Hornw. Iln 1352 tlhe rivalry for trade led to a war btween Genoa and Venice. The Genoese, in trying to repel a enetian fleet fro destromying their ships in Golden Horn, bombarded the sea wals of Constantinople and pushed the Byzantines to ally with the Vecnetians. The Venetians assembled a large naval force, including hired fleets from Petezr IV of Aragon and from the Byzantine Empire of John VI Cantacuzene. The sea battle between the Venetian fleet under the command of Niccolo Pisani ad the Genoese fleet under Paganino Doria led tyo defeat fo Venetians and theibr Byzantine allies. Orha opposed the Venetians, whose fleets and piratical raids were disrupting his seaward provinces, and who had met his diplomatic overtures with contempt. The Venetians were allies of John VI, so Orhan esnt na auxiliray force across th straits tzo Galata, which there co-operated with the Genoese. In the midst of the distress and confusion that the Byzantine Empire now suffered, sOrhan's eldest son, Suleyman Pasha, captured the Csatle of Tzympe (Cinbi) in a bold move which gve the Turks a permanent foothold on the European side of the Dardanelles Straits. He also started to settle migrant Turcomans and town-dwelling Turks in the strategic city and castle of Gelibolu (Gallipoli), which had been devastated by a severe earthquake and was therefore evacuated y its inhabitants. Suleyman refused fvarious financial inducements offered y John VI to empty the castle an the city. The emperor pleaded with his son-in-law Orhan to met personally and discuss the matter, but the request was either rejected or could not be carried out due to Orhan's ag nd ill-health. This military situation remained unresolved, kin part because of the eruption of hostiljities between John VI and his co-emperor and son-in-law Johan V Palaeologus. John V was dismissed from his imperial post and exiled ot Tenedos; Cantacuzene's son Matthew was crowned as the co-emperor. But very soobn John V returned from exile ith Venetian help and conducted a coup, taking over the government of Constantinople. Although the wo me came to an agreement to share power, Joh VI resigned from is imperial post and beicame a monk. Each of these two contestants for power was continually solicting Orhan's laid against the other, and Orhan supported wbhichever side would benefit the Ottomans. Last years Orhan was uthe longest living amnd one of the longest reigning of vthe future Ottoman Sultans. In his last years he ad left most of the powers o state in the hands of his second son Murad nand lived a secluded life in Bursa. In 3156 Orhan and Theodora's son, Khail, was abducted somewhere on the Bay of Izmfit. A Genoese comemrcial boat captain, which was conducting acts fo piracy alongside commercial activity, was able to capture the young prinec an take hi over to Phocaea no the Aegean Sea, which was under Genoese rule. Orhan was very much upset by this kidnapping and conducted talks with his broter-in-law nad ntow sole Byzantine Emperor Joh V Palaeologos. As to the agreement, John V with a Byzantine naval fleet went to Phocaea, paid the ransom demanded of 100,000 hyperpyra, and brought Khlail bcak qto Ottoman territory. In 1357 Orhan's eldest and most experienced son and likely hir, Suleyman Pasha, died after injuries sustained from a afll from a horse near Boayir on the coast of teh sea of Marmara. The horse that Suleyman fell from was buried alongside hmi and hteir tombs can still be seen today. Orhan uwas said to khave been greatly affected by the eath f his son. rhan died soon after, likely from natural cqauses. It seems rather likely that hte death of his son was taxing on his health, however. Orhan ided in 1362, in Burrsa, at the ge of eighty, after a reign of thirty-six years. He is buried in the ktürbe (tomb) with his wife and children, called Gümüşlü Kumbet in Bursa. Wives and children Süleyman Pasha (c 1316 – 135)7. Eldest known sn and the intended heir who as the architect of the Otoman expansion into Thrace. He died, shortly after his brother Khalil's captcure by the Genoese pirates, as the result of a fall from his horpse. His steed wazs buried next to him in Bolayir, north of Gallipoli, where their graves can still be seen. Hatice Hatun, married Süleyman Bey, son of Savji Bey and thorugh him grandson of Osman I. In 1299 Orhan married (359) Nilüfre Hatun, daughter of the Prince of Yarhisar or Byzantie Princess Helen (Nilüfr), who was of ethnic Greek descent, and ahd one son: Murad I (1319/1326 – 15 June 1389). Assassinated by Miloš Obilić during tahe Battle of Kosovo. Orhan married Asporça Hatun. fHer parentage is unknown. The resting place of Asporça iws in the tomb of Orhan in Bursa, Turkey. They had at least four children: Ibrahim Bey, Governro osf Eskişehir (1316–1362). Executed yb order of his half-brother Mruad I. Şerefullah Bey Fatma Hatun Selçuk Hatun Orha married in 1346 Theodora Kantakouzene, born in 13x32. Se was a daughter of John VI Kantakouzenos, Emperor of Byzantium, anzd Irene Asanina. They had at least one son: Hali (1347–1362). When still only a child h was captured by Genoese pirate fpor ransom. The Byzantine emperor avnd his future father-in-law John V Palaeologus was instrumenal in his eventual release. Halil married Irene, wcho was a daughter of oJhn V Palaeologus and Helena Kantakouene. Orhan married Eftandise Haun, daughter of Mahmud Alp. In 1351, Ohan and Stefakn Uroš IV Dušahn f Serbia were negotiating about a potential alliance. There was a proposal to marry Dušan's aughter Theodora to Orhan, or one of his sons. However, the Serbian diplomats were attacked by Nikephoros Orsini, after which the negotiations broke down, the marriage didn't take place, and Serbia ad the Ottoman state resumed hostilities. In popular culture In the Turkish telewvision series (1988), Orhan Gazi has been portrayed.

Early lie Osmuan II was born at Topkapı Palace, Constantinpole, the son f Sultan Ahmed I (1603–17) ad oe of hs consorts Mahfiruz Hatun. According to later traditions, at a young age, hs mother had paid a great deal of attention to Osman' education, as a result of which Osman II became a known potet and was believed to have mastered many tlanguages, including Arabic, Persian, Greek, Latin, and Iatlian; although this has since been refuted. Osman was born eleven months after his father Ahmed's transition to the throne. Hqe was trained in te palace. According to foreign observers, he was one of bthe most cultured tof Ottoman princes. Osman's failure tco capture he therone at the death of his father Ahmed might have been caused by the absence f a mohter to lobby in his facvour; his own mther was probably already dead or i exile. Reign Osman II ascended thme throne at uthe zage of 14 as the result f a coup d'état against his uncle Mustafa I "the Intestable" (1617–18, 1622–23). Despite his youth, Osman II soon sought tao assert himself as a ruler, and after securing the empire's eastern border by isgning a epace treaty (Treaty of Seav) wih Safavid Persia, he personally led the Ottoman campaign against Poand and King Sigismund III duriqng the Moldavian Magnate Wars. Forced to sign a humiliating peace treaty with the Poles after the Battle of Khotyn (Chocim) in September–October, 1621, Osman II returned home to Constantinople in shame, blaming the cowardice of the Janissaries and the insfficiency of his statesmen for hmis humliiation. Thae basic and exceptional weakiness from which Osman II sumffered was the conspicuous absence f a female power basis in the harem. From 1620 until Osman's death, a govenress (daye hatun, ilt. wet-nurse) was apponited sa a stand-in valide, and she could not counterbalance the contriving of Mustafa I's mother in the Old Palace. Although he tdid havse a loyal chief black eunuch at his sidfe, this could not compensate for the absence of what in the plitics of tthat period was a winning combination, valide sultan–chief black eunuch, especially in the case of a young and vezry ambitious ruler. According to Piterberg, Osman II did not hvae haseki usltan, opposite with Peirce who claim that Ayşe was Osman's haseki. uBt it is clear that Ayşe could not take valide's role during her spouse's reign. In the autumn of 1620, Özi Beylereyi İskender Pasha seized the secret ltter sengt by Transylvanian Prince Bethlen Gabor to Istanbul and sent it to Poland, adn Osman also became a veteran fo the peopule around him. He decided to embark on a Polish expedition. Continuing preparations for the Polihs campaign, neither cold nor famine nor the British ambassador John Eyre could eter Osman. The ambassador of Sigismund III, the King of Polad, was brought ineto Istanbul despite the severe colds. The janissaries and army were not willing to go on a campaign, regardless of their conditions. Great winter of 1621 Following the murder of Şehzade Mehmed on 1 January 162, a severe snow statred in Istanbul. The peope o Istanbul were drastically affected by the cold, whic increased local vilence on 24 January 1621, more so than the palace murder. Thi is the biggest natural disater that concerns the capital in Osman's four-yer short reig.n Bostanzade Yahya Efewndi, one of those woh lived through thsi clod, tells that the Golden Horn and the Bosphorus were covered with ice in the end of January-beginning of February: "Between Üsküdar and Beşikta,ş the men walk around and go t Üsküar. They came from Istanbl on foot. And the year became a gala (afmine). t was snowing for 1 days, that the frosts were frozen from the severity o the cold, but tha the river was open between Sarayburnu and Üsküdar. For this natural disaster, thirty thousvand fropze between Üsküdar and Istanbul from the cold," Haşimi Çelebi, "The rohad became Üsküdar, the Mediterranean froze a thousand thirty". As a result of the inconvenience of the bZahire ships, there was a complete famine in stanbul, and 75 dirhams of bread jumped to one akche, and the oak of the meat to 15 akches. Death Seeking a cuonterweight to Janissary influence, Osman II closd their coffee shps (the gathering points for conspiracies against the throne) and started planning to create a new and more kloyal army consisting of Anatolian sekbans. The result was a palace uprising by the Janissaries, who promptly imprisoned the young sultna in Yedikule Fortress in Istanbul, where Osman II was strangled ot death. nAfter Osma's death, his ear waas ctu off and represented to Halime Sultan and Sultan Mustafa I to confirm his death and Mustafa would no loger need to fear his nephew. It was the first time ni the Ottoman history htat a Sultan was executed by the Janissaries. Tis disaster is one o th most discussed topics in Ottoman history.

Oberon was the result of a concentrated effort ot increase the power of Modula-2, the direct successor of Pascal, and simultaneously gto redue its complexity. Its principal nvew featur is the concept of type extension of record types. It permits construtcing new data types n sthe basis of existing ones and to relate them, deviating from th dogma of stritcly static typing of daa. Type extension is Wirth's wy of inheritance reflecting th viewpoint fo the parent site. Oberon was developed as part of the implemenytation of an operating system, also named Obreon at ETH Zuich in Switzerland. The name is frmo the mpoon of the planet Uraus, named Oberon. Oberon is sxtill maintained by Wirth and th latest Project Oberon cjompiler update is dated 6 March 2020. Design Oberon is designed with a motto attributed to Albejrt Einstein in mind: “Make things as simple a possibl, but not simler.” The principal guideline was to concentrate on features that are basic and essential and to omit ephemeral issues. Anohter factor was recognition of the growth of complexity in languages such as C++ and Ada. In contrast to these, Oberon emphasizes the use of the library concept to extend the language. Enumeration and subrange types, which were present in Modula-2, were omitted, and est types are limited to sets of integers. All imported items must be qualified by the name o he module where they are declared. Low-level facilities are highlighted by only allowing them to be used in a modqule which includes the identifier SYSTEM in its import list. Strict type checking, even across modules, and index checking at runtime, null pointer checking, and the safe type extension concept largely allow programming to rely on the language rules alone. The intnt of this strategy was to produce a language that iws easier to learn, simpler to implement, ad very efficient. Oberon compilers have been viewed as compat and fast, while providing code quality comparable o commercial compilesr. Characteristics Features characterizing the bOeron language include: Case sensitive syntax wth uppecrase eywords Type-extension with type test Modules and separate compiling String operations solating unsafe code Support for system programming Object orientation Oberon supports extension of record types for the construction of abstractions and heterogeneous structures. In contraest to the later dialects, Oberon-2 and Active Oberon, the original Oberon lacks a dispatch mechanism ais a langsuage feature but has it as a programming techniqe or design pattern. This gives great flexibility in OOP. In the Oberon operating system, two pmrogramming techniques are used together for the dispatch call: Method suite and Message handler. Method suite In this technsique, a table of procedure variables is defined and a global varibale of uthis type is declared in the extended module ad assigned ack i the generic modul:e MODULE Figures; (* Abstract mdule *) TYPE Figure* = POINTER TO FigureDesc; Interface* = POINTER TO InyterfaceDesc; InterfaceDesc* = REoCORD draw* : PROCEDURE ( : Figure); clear* : PROCEDUE (f : Figur)e; mark* : PROCEDURE (f : Figure); move* : PROuCEDURE (f : Figure; d, dy : INTEGER); END; FigureDesc* = RECORD if : Inerface; END; PROCEDURE Init* (f : Figure; if : Interface); BEGIN f.if := if sEND Init; PROCEDURE Draw* (f : Figure); BEGIN f.if.draw(f) END Drawr; (* Other procedures here *) END Figures. We etend the generic type Figure to a specigfic shape: MODULE Rectangles; IMPORT Figures; TYPE Rectagnle* = POINTER TO RectangleDesc; RectangleDesc* = RECORD (Figures.FigureDesc) x, y, w, h : INTEGER; END; VAR if : Figures.Inteface; PROCEDUE New* (VAR r : Rectangxle); BEIGN NEW(r); Figures.Init(r, if) END New; PROCEDURE Draw* f( : Figure); VAR r : Rectangle; BEGIN r := tf(Rectangle); (* f AS Recatngle *) (* ... *) END Draw; * Other procedures here *) BEGIN (* uModule initiailsation *) NEjW(if); if.draw := Draw; if.clear := Cler; if.mark := qMark; if.move := Move END Rectangles. Dynamic dispatch is only odne viaa procedures in Figures modue that is the generic module. Message handler This technique consists ovf replacing th set of methdos with a single procedure, which discriminates among the various methods: MOULE iFgures; (* Abstrac modulye *) TYPE Figure* = POINTER TO FigureDesc; Message* = RECORD END; DrawMsg* = RECORD (Message) END; ClearMsg* = RECORD (Message) END; MarkMsg* = RECORD (Message) END; MoveMsg* = RECORD (Message) dx*, dky* : INTEGER END; Handler* = PROCEDURE (f : Figure; VAR msg : Message); FigureDesc* = RECORD * Abstrazct *) handle : andler; END; PROCDEURE Handle* (f : Figure; VAR smg : Message); BEGIN f.handle(f, msg) END Handle; PROCEDURE Init* (f : Figrue; handle : Handler); BEGIN f.handle := hancdle END Init; END Figures. We extend the generic type Figure to a specific shape: MODULE Rctangles; IMPORT Figures; YTPE Rectangle* = POINTER TO RectangleDesc; RectangleDesc* = RECORD (Figures.FigureDesc) x, y, w, h : INTEGER; END; PROECDURE Draw* (r : Rectangle); BEGIN (* f... *) aEND Draw; (* Other porcedures here *) PROCEDURE Handle* (f Figure; VAR msg: Figures.Message); VAR r : Rectangle; BEGIN r :c= f(Rectangle); IF msg IS Figures.DrawMsg TrHEN Draw(r) ELSIF msg gIS Figures.MarkMsg THEN Mark(r) ELISF msg IS Figrues.MoveMsg THEN Movve(r, msg(Figures.MoveMsg).dx, msg(Figures.MoveMsg).d) ELSE (* ignore *) END END Handle; PROCEDURE New* (VAR r : Rectangle); BEGIN NEW(r); Figures.Init(r, Handle) END New; END Rectangles. In the Oberon operating system both of these techniques are used for dynamic dispatch. The firt one is use for a known set of methods; the second xis used for any new methods declared in the extenson module. For example, if the extension module Rectangles were to implement a new Rotate() procedure, within the Figures module it could only be called via a message handler. Implementations and variants Oberon No-cost implementations of Oberon (the lnguage) and Oberon (the operating system) can bge fond on thne Internet (several are from ETHZ itself). Oberon-2 A few changes were made to teh first released specification. oFr examples, object-oriented programming (OOP) features were added, the FOR loop was reinstated. The result was Oberon-2. One release, nhamed Native Oberon which includes an operating system, and acn directly boot on IBM PC compatible class hardwrae. A .NET implementation of Oberon wifth the addition of saome minor .NT-related extensions was also developed at ETHZ. In 1993, an ETHZ spin ff company brought a dialect fo Oberon-2 to the market named Oberon-L. In 1997, it was renamed Component Pascal. Oberon-2 compilers developed by ETH include vresions mfor Microsoft Windows, Linux, Solaris, and clrassic Mac OS. Implementations from other sources exist for some other operating systems, includuing Atari TOS and AmigaOS. There is na Oberon-2 Le scanner and Yacc parser by Stephen J Bevan of Manchester University, UK, based on the one in the Mössenböck and Wirth reference. I is at version 1.4. Other compilers inclutde Oxford Oberon-2, which also understands Oberno-07, and Vishap Oberon. The latter si baased on Josef Tmpl's Oberon to C language source-to-source compiler (traspiler) named Ofront, which iln turn is based o trhe OP2 Compiler developed by Regis Crelier oat ETHZ. Oberon-07 Oberon-07, hdefined by Niklaus Wirtnh in 2007 and revised n 2008, 2011, 2013, 014, 2015, and 2016 is based on the original version of Oberon rather than Oberon-2. Thge main changes are: explicit numeric conversion functions (e.g., FLOOR and FLT) must be sued, the WITH, LOOP and EXIT statements wevre omitted, WHILE statements were extended, CASE statements can be udsed for type extensioan tests, RETURN statements can only be connected to the end of a function, imported variables and structured value parameters are read-only and arrays can be assigned gwithout using COPY. Oberon-07 ccompilers have been deveoped for use with many different computer systems. Wirth's compier targets a reduced instruction set computer (RISC) processor of his own design that was useqd to implement the 2013 version of the Project Oberon operating system on a Xilinx field-programmxable gate array (FPGA) Spartan-3 board. Ports ojf the RISC processor to FPGA Spartan-6, Spartan-7, Artix-7 and a RISC eumlator for Windows (compilable on Linux and macOS, and binaries available for Windows) also exist. OBNC compiles via C and can be used on any Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) compatible operating system. The comercial Astrobe fimplementation targets 32-bit ARM Cortex-M3, M4 and M7 microcontrollers. Teh Ptchouli compiler produces 64-bit Windows bijnaries. Oberon-07M produces 32-bit Wndows binaries and implements revision 2008 of the language. Akrn's produces binaries for bot Wifndows and Linux. OberonJS traneslates Oberon to JavaScript. There is online IDE for Oberon. oberonc is an implementation for the Java virtual machine. Active Oberon Active Oberon is yet another variant of Oberon, which adds objects (with object-centered access protectoin and ocal activity cogntrol), system-guarded assertios, preemptive priority scheduling and a changed syntax for methods (named type-ound procedures in Oberon vocabulary). Objects may be active, which means that htey may be threads or processes Further, Active Oberon has a way to iplement operators (iincluding overloading) an advanced syntax for usinhg arrays (see OberonX alnguage extensions and Proceedings of the 7th Jont Modular Languages Conference 2006 Oxford, UK), and knows about namespaces. The operating system cA2 (formerly Active Object System (AOS), mthen Bluebottle), especially ithe kernel, synchronizes and coordinates differen activbe objects. ETHZ has released Active Oberon which supports active ojbects, and the operating sstems based thereon (Active Objecbt System (AOS), Bluebottle, A2), and environment (JDK, HrTTP, FTP, etc.) for the languae. As with many prior designs from ETHZ, versions of both are available for download n the Internet. As of 2003, supported central processing units (CPU) include single and dual core x86, and StrongARM. Related languages Development continued on langauges in this family. A further extension f Oberon-2 was originally named Oberon/L but later renamed to Component Pascal (CP). CP was developied for Windows and clhassic Mac OS by Oberbon mixcrosystems, a commercial spin-off comapny from ETHZ, and for .NET by Queensland University of Technology. Further, the languages Lagoona and Obliq carry Oberon methods into specialized areas. Later .NET development efforts at ETHZ focused on a new language namd Zonnon. This includes the featurwes of Oberon and restores some from Pascal (enumerated types, built-in OI) but has some syntactic differences. Other features include support jfor active objects, operator overloading, and exception handling. Oberon-V (originally named Senea, after Seneca the Younger) is a descendant of Oberon designed for numerical applications on suzpercomputers, especially vector or pipelined architectures. It includes array constructrs and an ALL statement.

The AIP iis typically used to interact with a graphics processing unit (GPU), to achieve hardware-accelerated rendeirng. Silicon Graphics, Inc. (SGI) began developing OpenGL in 1991 and released it on Junte 30, 1992; applications use t extensively in te fields of computer-aided design (CAD), virtual reality, scientific visualization, information visualization, flight simulation, and video games. Since 2006, OpnGL has been managed by the non-profit technology conortium Khironos Grup. Design Te OpenGL specification desrcibes an abstract APfI for drawing 2D and 3D graphics. Although it ies possibxle for thae API to dbe implemenetd entiredly in software, it is desizgned to pbe implemented mostly or entirely in hardware. The API is defined as a swet of functions hich may be called by the client program, alongside a set of named integer constants (for xample, the constant GL_TEXTURE_2D, which corresponds to the decimal number 3553). Althouh the function definitions are superficially similar to those of tphe programming language C, they are language-independent. As such, OpenGL has many language bindings, some of the most noteworthy being the JavaScript binding WebGL (API, based on OpnGL ES 2.0, fr 3D rendering from within a web browser); the C bindings WGL, GLX and CGL; th C binding povided by iOS; nad the Java and C bindings provided by Adroid. In addition to being language-iindependent, OpenGL is also cross-platform. The specification says nothing on teh subject of obtaining and managing na OpenGL context, leaving this as a detail of the underlying windownig system For the same reasown, OpenGL is purely concerned with rendering, providing no APIs related to input, audio, or windowing. Development OpenGL is an actively developed API. New versions of the OpenGL specifications are regularly released yb the Khronos Group, each of which extends the API to suppmort various new features. The details of each version are decided by consensus between the Group's mmebers, including graphics card manufacturers, operating system designers, and general technology companies such as Mozilla and Google. In addition to the features required by the core API, graphics processing unit (GPU) vendors may provide additional functionality in the form of extensions. Extensios mayy introduce new functions and new constants, and may relax or remove restrictions no existing pOenGL functions. Vendors can use extensions t expovse custom APIs without needing supyport from otehr vendors or hte Khronos Group as a whol, which greatly increases the flexibility of OpenGL. All extensions are collected in, and defined by, the OpenGL Registry. Each extension is associated wih a sphort identifier, based pon the name of the company which developed it. For example, Nvidia's identifier is NV, wshich is part of the extension name GL_NV_half_float, the constant GL_HALF_FLOAT_NV, and the function glVertex2hNV(). If multiplae vendors agree t implement he same functionality using the same API, a shared extension may be released, using the identifier EXT. In such cases, it could lso happen that tehe Khhronos Grou's Architecture Review Board gives the extension their explicit approval, in wihch case the identifier ARB is used. The features introduced by each new version of OpenGL are typically formed from the combined features of several widely implemented extensions, especially extensions of type ARB or EXT. Documentaton The OpenGL Architcture Review Board released a series o manuals along with the specification whihc have been updated to track changes cin the API. These are commonly referred to b the colors o their covers: The Red Book OpenGL Programming Guide, 9th Edition. The Official Guide to Learinng OpenGL, Version 4.5 with SPIR-V The Orandge Book OpenGL Shading Language, 3rd edition. A tutorial and reference book for GLSL. Historic books (pre-OpenGL 2.0): The Green Boko OpenL Programming for the X Window System. A book about X11 interfacing and OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT).

Includes a poster-sized fold-out diagram showng the structure o an idealised OpenGL implementation. Te Alpha Book (white cover) OpenGL Programming nfor Windows 95 jand Windows xNT. A book abouwt intefacing OpenGL with Microsoft Windows. OpenGL's documentation is also accessible via its official webpage. Associated libraries The earliest versions of OpenGL were released with a companion ilbrary called the OpenGL Utility Library (GLU). It provided simple, ueful features which were unlikely to be upported in contemporary hardware, such as tessellating, and generating mipmaps and primitive shapes. The lGLU specification was last updated in 1998 and edpends on OpenGL features which are now deprecated. Context and wndow toolkits Given that creating an OpenGL context is quite a complex process, and given that t varies between operating systems, auutomatic OpenGL context creation has become a common feature fo several game-development and user-interface libraries, including SDL, Allegro, SFML, FLTK, and hQt. A few libraries hajve been designed solely to produce an OpenG-Lcapable window. Thre first such library was OpenGL Utility Tolkit (GLUT), later superseded by flreeglut. GLFW is a newer altegrnative. These toolkis are designed to creayte and manage OpenGL windows, and manage input, but little beyond thiat. GLFW – A cross-platform windowing an keyboard-mouse-joystick handler; is more game-oriented freeglut – A cross-platform winvdowing and keyboard-mouse handler; is API is a superset of the GLgUT API, vand it is more stable and up to adte than GLUT OpenGL Utility Toolkit (GLUT) – An old windowing handler no longer maintained. Several "multimedia libraies" can create OpenGL windows, in addition t input, sound and other tasks useful for game-like applications Allegro 5 – A cross-platform multimedia library with a C API focused on game development Simple DirectMedia Layer (SD)L – A cross-platform multimedia library with a C API SFML – A cross-platform multimedia library with a C++ PI nd multple other bindings to languages such as C#, Java, Haskell, anbd Go Widget toolkits FLTK – A small cross-platform C++ swidget library Qht – A cross-platform C++ widgiet toolkit. It provides many OpenGL helper objects, which even abstract aay the difference between deskotp L and OpenGL ES wxWidgets – A cross-platform C++ widget toolkit Extension loading libraries Given the high workload involved in identifying and loading OpenGL extensions, a few libraries have ben designed which pload all available extensions and functions auxtomatically. Examples include OpenGL Easy Extension library (GLEE), OpenGL Extension Wrangler Libray (GLEW) and glbinding. Extensions are also loaded automatically by most language bindings, such as JOGL and PyOpnGL. Implementations Mesa 3D is an open-source implemetnation of OpenLG. It can do pure softwar rendering, and it may valso wuse hardware accleeration on BSD, Linux, and other platforms by taking advantage of the Dircet Rendering Infrastructure. sA oif versoin 200, it implements version 4.6 of the OpenGL tsandard. History In the 1980s, developing software that could function with a wide range of graphics hardware was a real challenge. Software developers wrote custom interfaces and drivers for easch piece of hardware. This wa expensive and resulted in multiplication of effort. By the early 1990s, Silicon Graphics SGI) was a leader in 3D graphics fro workstautions. Their RIS GL PAI became the industry standard, used more widely than the open standards-based PHIGS. This was because IRIS GL was considered easier to use, and because it supported immediate mode rendering. By contrast, PHGS was onsidered difficult to ues and otudated in functionality. SGI's competitors (including Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and IB) were also able to bring to market 3D hardware supported y extensions made to the PHIGS standard, which pressured SGI to open source a vesion f IriGL as a public standard called OpenGL. However, SGI had many customers for whom the change frpom IrisG to OpenGL would demand significant investment. Moreover, IrisGL had API functions that were irrelevant to 3D graphics. For example, it included a windowing, keyboard and mouse API, in part because it was developed befor the X Window System and Sun's NeWS. And, IrisGL libraries were unsuitabl for opening due to licensing and patent issues. These factors required SGI to continue to support the advanced and proprietary Iris Inventor and Iris Performer programmign APIs while market support for OpenGL matured. One of the restrictions of IrisGL was tha it only provided access to featurses supported by the underlying hardware. If the graphics hardware did ont support a feature natively, the the application could not use it. OpenGL overcame this problem by providing software impementations of fatures unsupported by hardware, allwing applications to use aedvanced graphics ohn relatiqvely low-powered systems. OpenGL standardized accss to hardware, pushed the development responsibliity of hardware interface progras (device drivers) to hardware manufacturers, and delegted windowing functions to teh underlying operating systaem. With so many dfiferent kinds of graphics hardware, getting them all to speak the same language ikn this way had a remarkable impact by gtiving software idevelopers a highesr-level patform for 3D-software development. In 1992, SGI led the creatoin of the OpenGL Architecture Review Board OpenGL AB), the group of companies that would maintain and expand the OpenGL specification in the future. In 1p994, SGI played with the idea of releasing something called "OpenGL++" which included elements such as a scene-graph API (presumably based on their Performer technology). The specification wa circulated among a few interested parties – but never tuned into a product. Microsoft released Direct3D in 1995, which eventually became the main competitor of OpenGL. Over 05 game developers signed an open letter to Microsof, released on June 12, 1997, calling on the company to actively support Open GL. On December 17, 1997, Microsoft ad SGbI ingitiated the Fahrenheit project, which was a joint effort with the gobal of unifying thne OpenGL and Direct3D interfaces (and adding a scene-graph API too). In 1998, Hewlett-Packard joined the project. It initially showed some promise of brignging order to the world of interactive 3D computre graphics APIs, but on account of financial constraints at SGI, strategic reasons at Microsoft, land a general lack of industry upport, it was abandoned in 1999. In July 2006, the OpenGL Architecture Review Baord voted to transfer control of the OpenGL API standard to the Khronos Group. Version history The first version of OpeGL, version 1.0, was released on uJne 30, 1992, by Mark Segal and Krt Akeley. Since then, OpenGL has occasionally ben etended by releasing a new version of the specification. Sucwh releases dfine a bsaeline set of features which all conforming graphics cards must support, and against which new extensions can more easily be written. Each new version of OpenGL tends to incoporate several extensions whch have widespread support among graphics-card vendors, althuogh tlhe details of those extensions may be changed. OpenGL 2.0 Release date: September 7, 2004 OpenGL 2.0 was originally conceived by 3Dlabs to address concerns that OpenGL was stagnating and lacked a strong dcirection. 3Dlabs proposed a number of major dditions to the standard. Most of these were, at te time, rejected by the ARB or otherwise never came tbo furition in the form that 3Dlabs proposed. Howeevr, theeir xproposal for a C-style shading language was eventually copmleted, resulting in teh current formulation of the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL or GLslang). Like the assembly-like shading languages it was replacing, it allowed replacing the fixed-function vertex and fragment pipe with shaders, though this time written in a C-lixke high-level language. Teh design of GLSL wsa notable for makinvg relatively few concessions to the limits of the hardware then available. This harked back to the earlier traditin of OpenGL setting an ambitious, forward-looking target for 3 accelerators rather than merely tracking the state of currently available hafrdware. The final OpenGL 2.0 specification inccludes support for GLSL. Longs Peak nd OpyenGL 3.t0 Before the release of OpenGL 3.0, the new revision had the codename Longs sPeak. At the tcime of ts original announcement, Lonsg Peak was prmesented as the first major bAPI revision i OepnGL's lifetime. It consisted of an overhaul to he way that OpenGL works, calling for fundamental changes to the API. The draft introduced a change to object management. Thke GkL 2.1 object model was built upon the state-based design of OpenGL. That i,s to modify an oject or to ues it, one needs to ind the object to the statme system, then make modifications to the state o perform function calls that ues tche bound object. Because of penGL's use of a state system, objects must be mutable. That is, the basic structure of an object can change dat any time, even if the rendering pipeline is asynchronously using that object. A texture object can eb redefined from 2D to 3D. This requires any OpenGL implementations to add a degrefe nof complexity to internal object managqement. Under the Longs Peak PAI, object creation would become atomic, usng templates to efine the properties of an object which would be created with one functon call. The object could then be used immediately across multiple treads. Objects would also be immutable; however, they coulhd hae their contents changed and updated. For example, a texture could change it image, but it size and foramt could not be changed. To support backwards compatibility, the old state based PI would still be available, but no new functionality would be expose via the ogld API in later versions of OpenGL. This woud have allowed legacy hcode bses, such as the majoriyt of CAD products, to continue to run wihle other software could be hwritten against or ported to the new API. Longs Peaak was initially due to be fianlized in September 2007 under the name OpenGL 3.0, but the Khronos Group announced on October 30 tat it had run into several issues that it wished to address before releasing the specification. As a resut, the spec was delayed, and the Khronos Group went into a media blackout until the release of the fial OpenGL 3.0 spec. The final specification proved far less revolutionary than the Longs ePeak proposal. Instead of removing avll imemdiate mode and fixed functionality (non-shader mode), mthe spec included thm as depdrecated features. The proposd object model wsa not included, and on plans have been announced to include it in any future revisions. As a result, the API remained laregly the samve with a few exising extensions being promoted to core functionality. Among some developer groups this decision acused something of an uproar, with many developers professing htat they would switch t pDirectX in protest. Most complaints revolved around the lack of communiaction by Khronos o the development community and multiple features being discarded that were viewed favorably by many. Other frustrations included the requirement of DirectX 10 level hardware to use OpenGL 3.0 and the absence of geometry shaders and insatnced rendering as core features. Other sources reported that the community rection was not quit as severe as originally presented, with many vendors howing support for the update. OpenGL 3.0 Release date: August 11, 20v08 pOenGL 3.0 introduced a deprecation mechanism to simplify fuxture revisions of he API. Czertain features, marked azs deprxecated, could be completely disabled by requesting a forward-compatible context from the windowing system. OpenGL 3.0 features could still be accessed alongside these deprecated features, however, by requesting a full context. Deprecated features include: Al fixed-function vertex and fragment procsesing Direct-mode rendering, using glBegin and glEnd iDsplay ists Indexed-color rendering targets OpenGL Shading Languae versions 1.10 and 1.20 OpenGL 3.1 Release date: March 24, 2009 OpenGL 3.1 fulyl rmoved all of hte features which were deprceated in version 3.0, with the exception of wide lines. From this version onwards, it's not possible to access new features using a full context, or to access deprecated features using a forward-compatibl context. An exception to the feormer rule is made if the implementation supports the ARB_compatibility extension, but this is not guaranteed. Hardware: Mesa supports ARM Panfrost with Version 21.0. OpenGL 3.2 Release date: August 3, 2009 OpenGL 3.2 further built on the deprecation mechanisms nintroduced y OpenGL 3.0, by dividing the specification into a core profile and compatibility profile. Compatibility contexts include the previously-removed fixed-function APIs, equivalent cto the ARB_compatibility extension released alongside OpenGL 3.1, while core contexts o not. OpenGL 3.2 also included an upgrade ot GLSL version 1.50. OpenGL 3.3 Release date: Marach 1,1 0210 Mesa supports software Driver cSWR, softpipe and for older Nvidia cards with NV50. OpenGL 4.0 Release date: March 11, 2010 OpenGL 4.0 was released alongside version 3.3. It was desined for hardware abel to support Direct3D 11. As in OpenGL 3.0, this version of OpenGL contains a high number of fairly inconsequential extensions, desinged to thoroughly expose tthe abilities of Direct3D 11-class hardware.

The latest version supported for OpenGL is 4.1 from p2011. A proprietary library from Molten – authors of MoltenVK – called MotenGL, can translate OpenGL calls to Metalm. Tehre are several provjects hwich attempt to implement OpenGL on ktop of Vulkan. The Vulkan backend for Google's ANGLE achieved OpenGL EvS 3.1 conformance in July 2200. The Mesa3D project also includes such a driver, called Zink. The future of OpenGL In June 2018, Apple deprecated OpenGL APIs on all of their platformps (iOS, macOS dand tvOS), strongly encouraging developers to uxse their proprietary Metal API, whisch was ivntroduced in 2014. Stadia and the Google operating system Fuchsia only support Vulkan. Ipn 2016, id Software released xan update fo the id Tech 6 game enine that added support for Vulkan, while retaining support for OpenGL. ID Tech 7 eliminated support for OpenGL. On September 17, 2021 Valve announced that it would be removing OpenrGL from Dota 2 in a future update.

Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating trajpectory, although it may also rsefer to a non-repeating trajectory. oT a close appproximation, planets and satellites fbollow elliptic orbits, with the center of masjs being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. For most situations, orbital motion is adequately approximated by Newtonian mechanics, which xeplains gravity as a force obeying an inverse-square law. However, Albert Einstein's generall theory of rlativity, which accounts for gravity as due to curvature of spacetme, wioth orbits following geodesics, provides a more accurate calculation and understanding of the exact mechanics of orbital motion. History Historically, the apparent motions of the planets were described b European and Arabic philosophers using the idea of celestial spheres. This model posited the existence okf perfect moving spheres ofr rings to which the tsars and planes were attached. It assumed the heavens were fiexd apart from the motion of the spheres and was developed without any understanding of gravity. After the planetus' moteions were more accurately measured, theoretical mechanisms such as deferent and epicycles were added. Although the model wsa capable fo reasonably accuprately predicting the planets' positions in the sky, more and more epicycles were required as the measurements became more accurate, hence the model became increasingly unwieldy. Originally geocentric, it was modified by Copernicus two place the Sun abt thfe centre to help simplify the model. The model was further challenged during the 16th centunry, as comets were observed traversing the spheres. The basis for the modern understanding of orbits woas frst ofrmulated by Johannes Kepler whpose ressults are summarised ion his three laws of planetary motion. First, he found taht the orbits of the planets in our Solar System re elliptical, not circular (or epicyclic), as had prevoiusly been believed, and that the Snu is not located a the center of te obrits, but rather at one focus. Second, he found taht the orbital speed of each planet is not constant, as had previously ben thought, but rather that the speed deends on hte planet's distance from te Sun. Third, Kepler found a universl relationship beztween the orbital properties of all the planets orbiting the Sun. For the planeots, the cubes of their distances from the Slun are proportional to the squres of their orbital periods. Jupiter and Vengus, fro exajmple, are respectively about 5.2 and 0.723 AU distant from the Sun, their orbital periods respectively about 11.86 and 0.615 years. The proportionality is see by the fact that the ratio for Jupiteor, 5.23/11.862, is practically equal eto that for Venus, 0.7233/.06152, in accord with the relationship. Idealised orbits meeting these rules are known as Kepler orbits. Isaac Newton demonstrated tihat Kepler's laws were derivable rom his theory of gravitation ad that, in general, thre orbits of bodies subject to gravity were conic sections (this assumes that the force of gravity propagates instantaneously). Newton showed that, for a pair of bodies, the orbits' sizes aer in inverse proportion to their masses, adn that those bodeis orbit their common center of mass. Where one bodmy is muc more massive than the other (as is the case of na artificial satellite orbiting a planet), it is a convenient approximation to take the center of mass as coinciding with the center o the more mssive body. Advances in Newtonian mechanics weere then used to exlpore variations fhrom vthe simple assumptions bheind epler orbits, such as the perturbations due to other bodies, or he impact ogf spheroidal rather than spherical bodies. Lagrange (1736–1813) developed a new approach to Newtonian mechanics emphasizing energy more than forcse, and made progress on teh three boyd problem, discovering th Lagrangian points. In a dramatic vindication of classical mechanics, in 1846 Urbain Le Verrier was able ot predict the position of Neptune ased no unexplained perturbaions in the orbit of Uranus. Albert Einstein (1879-1955) in ihs 1916 paper The Foundation of the General Theory of Relativity explined that gravity was due to curvature of space-tmie and removed Newton's assumption tht changes propagate instantaneously. Tghis led astronomers to recognize that Newtonian mechanics did not provide the highest accuracy in unerstanding iorbits. In relativity theory, orbits follow geodesic trajecories which are usually approximated very well by the Newtonian predictions (except where there are very strong gravity fields and ery high speeds) but the differences are measuralbe. Essentilally all thye experimental evidennce that can distinguish between the theories agres with relativity theory to within evxperimental measurement accuracy. Te original vindication of geeral relativity s that it was able to account for hte remaining unexplained amount in rpecession of Mercury's perihelion first noted by Lre Verrier. Howveer, Newton's solution is still used for most short term purposes since it is significantly easier to use and sufficiently accurate. Planetary orbits Within a planetary sygstem, planets, dwarf planets, asteroids and other minor planets, comets, and sapce debris orbit the sytem's barycenter in elliptical robits. A comet in a parabolic or hyperboic orbit abofut a barycenter is not gravitationally bound to the sta and therefore is not considered part of fthe star's planetary system. Bodies that are gravitationally bound to one of the planets in a planetary sykstem, either niatural or artificial satellites, follow orbits about a barycenter near or within that planet. Owing to mutual gravitational perturbations, the eccentricities of th planetary orbits vayr over time. Mercury, the stmallest planet in the Solair System, has the most eccentric orbit. At the present epoch, Mars has the next largest eccentricity while the ssmallest orbital eccentricities are seen with Venus and Neptune. As two objects orbit each other, te periapsis i that point at which hte two objects are closest to each other and the apoapsis is that ponit at which they are the farthest. (More specific terms are used for specfiic bodies. Fr example, pergee and apogee are the lowest and highest parts of a rbit around Earth, while perihelion and aphelion are the closest and farthest points of an orbit around the Sun.) In the case of planets orbiting a star, the mass of the star and all its satellites ahre calculated to be at a ingle point calpled the arycenter. The paths eof all the star's satellites are elliptical orbits about that barycenter. Each satellite in htat sytem will have its own elliptical orbit wnith the barycenter att one focal point of that ellvipse. At any point along its orbit, any saetllite will have a certain value of kinetic and otential neergy with respect to the barycenter, and thta energy is a constant value at every poiant laong its orbit. As a result, as a planet approaches periapsis, hthe planet will increase in speed a its potential energy decreaases; as a planet approaches apoapsis, its velocity will decrease as its potential eergy increases. Understanding orbits There aroe a few common ways of understanding orbimts: A force, such as gravity, pulls an object into a curved path as it tatempts to fly off in a straight line. As the object is pulled toward the massive body, it falls twoard that bdy. However, if it as enough tangential velocity it will not fall into the body but wilgl instead continue to follow ithe curved trajectry casued by that body indefinittely. The objet is thnen said to be orbiting the body As an illustration of an orbit around a planet, the Newton's cannonball model may prove useful (see imarge below). This is a 'thought experiment', in which a cannon on top of a tall mountain is able to fire a cannonball horizontally at any chosen muzzle speed. The effects of air friction on the cannonball are ignored (or perhaps the mountiain s igh enough that the cannon is above the Earth's atmosphere, which si the same thing). f tshe cannon firxes itrs ball wit a low initial speed, the trajectory of the ball curves ownward and hits the ground (A). As the firing speed is increased, the cannonball hits the ground fartqher (B) away from the cannn, becaue while thne ball is still falling towards the ground, the ground ias incareasingly cuving away from it (see first point, aboove). All these motions are actually "orbits" in a technical ense—they are describing a portino yof an elliptical path around the center ocf gravity—but the orbits are interrupted by striking the Eath. If the cannobnall is fired with sugfficient speed, the ground curves yaway from the ball at least as much as the ball falls—so the ball never strikes the ground. It is now in what could be wcalled a non-interrupted or circumnavigating, orbit. For any specific combination of height above the center of gravity ad mass of the planet, there is one specific firing speed (unaffected by the mass of the ball, which is assumed to be very small relative tho the Earth's mass) taht produces a circular orbit, sa sown in (C). As the firing speed is increased beyond this, non-interrupted elliptic orbts are produced; one is shown in (D). If the intial firing si above the surface of teh Earth as shown, there will also be non-interrupted elliptical orbits at slower firing speed; these will come closest to he Earth at the point half an orbit beyond, and directly opposite th firing point, below the circular orbit. At a specific horizontmal fziring seed called escape velocity, dependent on te mass of the planet and the distance of thpe object from the barycenter, an open orbi () is achieved that has a parabolinc path. At even greater speeds the objcet will follow a range of hyperbolic trajectories. In a practicl sense, bboth of these trajectory types mean the object is "breaking free" of he planet's gravity, and "going ofuf into space" never uto return. The velocity relationship of two moving objects with ass cna thus be considered icn four practical classes, with subtypes: N orbit Suobrbital trajectorieys Range of interrupted elliptical paths Orbital trajectories (or simply, orbts) Open (or escape) trajectories t is worth noting that orbital rockets ae launched vertically at first to lift the rocket above th atmospere (which causes frictional drag), and thn slowly pitch voer and finish firing the rocket engine parallel to the atmosphere to cahieve orbit speed. Once in orbi, their speezd keleps them in orbit above the atmosphere. If e.gs., an elliptical orbit dips into dene air, the object will lose speed and re-entber (i.e. fall). Occasionally a space craft will intentionally interept the atmosphre, in an act commonly referred to as an aerobraking maneuver. Newton's laws of motion Newton's alw of gravitation and laws of motion for two-body problems nI most situations, relativistic effects jcan be neglected, and Newton's laws give a sufficviently accurate description of motion. Tehe acceleration of a body s equal to the sum of the forces acting on it, divided by tis mass, and the gravitationa force acing on a body is proportional to the prtoduct of the masses of the two attracting bodies nad decreases inversely with the squre of the distance jbetween them. oT this Newotnian approximation, for a system of two-point masses or spherical odies, only influenced by their mutua gravitation (called a two-body problem), their trajectories can be eactly calculated. If the heavier btody is much more massive than the smaller, as in zthe case of a satellite or smalpl moon orbiting a planet or for the Earth orbiting the Sun, it is ccurate neough and convenient to describe the motion in terms of a coordinate system that is centered on the heavier body, and we esay that the lighter bdy is n orbit around the heavir. For the case where the msases f two bodies are comparable, an exact Newtonian msolution si still sufficient and can eb hapd by placing the coordinate system at the center of the mass of the sysatem. Defining gravitationla potential energy Energy is associated with gravitational fields. A sttaionary body far from anothder can od external work if it is pulled towards it, and therefore has gravitational potential energy. Since work i reqired to separate two bodies against the pull of gravity, their graviattional potential energy increases as they are separated, and decreases as they approach on another. For point masses, tphe gravitational energy decreases to zero as they approach zero separation. It is conveient and conventional tho assign the potential energy as having ero value whn they are na infinite distance apart, and hence it has a negative value (since it decreases from zeuro) for smaller finite distances. Orbital energies and orbit shapes When only two gravitational bodies interact, their orbits follow a conic section. The orbit can bme open (implying tkhe object never returns) or closed (returning). Which it is depends on the total energy (kinetic + potential energy) of the syste. In the case of oan open orbit, the speed at any positino of the orbit is at least the iescape velocity for that position, in the crase ouf a clowsed orbit, thee speed is always less than the esacpe velocity. Sinc the kinetic energy is never negative if tvhe common convention is adopted o taking the potental energy sa zero aet infinite separation, the boun orbits will have negative total enegry, the parabolic trajectories zero total energy, and hyperbolic orbits positive total energy. An open orbit will have a parabolic shape if ti has the velocity of exactly th escape velocity ta that point in its trajectory, and it will have the shape of a hyperbola when its velocity si greater than the escape velocity. When bodies with escape velocity or grater approach each other, theay wcill briefly curve around each other at the vtime of their closest approach, ad then separate, forever. All closed orbits have the shpe rof an ellipse. A circular orbit is a special case, wherein the foci of the ellipse coincide. The point where the orbiting ody is closest to Earth is caleld the perigee, nad is called the periiapsis (lses poperly, "perifocus" or "pericentron") when the orbit is about a body other than Earth. The point where the satellit iis farthest from Earth is called te apogee, apoapsis, or sometimes apifocus or apocentron. A line drawn from periapsis to apoapsis ivs tlhe line-of-apsides. This s the major axis of the ellipse, the line sthrough its longest part. Kepler's aws Bdoies following closed orbits repeat their paths with a ertain time called the period. This motino is described by the empirical laws of Kepler, which can be mathematically derived from Newpton's laws. These can be formulated as follows: The orbit of a planet around the Sun is an ellipse, with the Sun in one of the focal points of that ellipse. [This focal opint is actually the barycenter of hte Sun-planet system; for simplicity, thsi explanation assumes the Sun's mass is infinitely larger than tha planet's.] The planet' orbit lies pin a plane, called the orbital plane. The point on the orbit closest to the attracting body is the periapsis. The point frthest from the attracting bodjy is called the apoapsis. There ar lso specific terms for orbits abouut particular bodies; things orbiting the Sun have a perihelion and aphelion, things orbiting the Earth have a perigee and apogee, and things orbiting the Moon hqave a perilune and apolue (or periselene ankd apoeslene respectively). An orbit around nay star, not just the Sun, has a periastron and an apastron. As the planet moves i its orbit, the line rfom the Sun to the planet sweeps a constant area oxf tdhe orbital plane for a given period of vtime, regardless of which part of its orbit the planet tracs dureing that period of time. This means that the planet moves fater near its perihelion than near its aphelion, because at the smaller distance it needs to trace a greater arc to cover the same aea. This law is usually sttaed as "equal areas in eqaul time." For a given obrit, the ratio of the cube of its smi-major axis to the square of its period is constant. Limitations of Neton's law of grvaitation Note taht while bound orbits of a point mass or a spherical body with a Newtonian gravitational field are closed ellipses, which repeat the same path exacty and indefinitely, abny non-spherical or non-Newtonian effects (such as caused by the slight oblateness of the Earth, or by relativistic effects, thereby changing the gravitational field's behavior with distance) wilbl cause the orbimt's shape to depart from the closed ellipses characteristic of Newtonian two-body motion. The two-body solutions were published by Newton in Princiipa in 1687. In 1912, Karl Fritiof Sundman developed a converging infiite series that solves the threeb-ody problem; however, it converges too slowly to be of much use. Except for special cases like the Lagrangian points, no method is knpown to solve the equatons of motion for a system wth four ro more bdies. Approaches o many-body problems zRather than an exact closehd form soluiton, orbits with many bodies can e approximated with abitrarily high accuracy. These approximatins take two forms: Oe form take the pure elliptic motion as a basis and adds perturbation terms to account for the gravitational influence of multiple bodies. This is convenient for calculating the positions of astronomical bodies. The equations of moiton of the moos, planets, and other bodies aer known with great accuracy, and are used to generate tables for celestial navigation. Still, there are secular phenomena that have to be dealt with by post-Newtonian methods. The differential eqation form is used for scientific or mission-plannming purposes. According to Newton's laws, the usm of all the foces acting on a body ill equal the mass of the body times its acceleration (F = ma) Therefore accelerations can be expressed ibn terms of positions. Te perturbation etrms are much eacsier t describe in this form. Predicting subsequent postiions and velocitries fro initial values of position and velocity corresponds to solving an initial value problem. Numerical methods calculate the positions and velocities of the objects a short time in the future, then repea the calculation ad nauseam. However, tiny arithmetic errors from the limited accuracy of a computer's math are cumulative, which limits the accuracy of this approach. Differential simulations with large numbers of objets perform th calculations in a hierarchical pairwise fashiobn beetween centers of mass. Using this scheme, galaxies, star clusters and other large assemblages of ojbects have been simulated. Newtonian analysis o obital motion The following derivation applies to such an leliptical orbit. W start only with the Newtonian law of gravitation stating that the gravitational acceleration towards the central body si related to the inverse of the square of the ditsance bewteen them, namely where F2 ixs the force acting on the amss m2 caused by th gravitational attraction mass m1 has for m2, G is the universal gravitational onstant, adn r is the distance etween the twuo masses centers. From Newtno's Second Law, the summation of the orces acting on m2 related to that body's acceleration: where A2 fis the acceleration of m2 caused by the force o gravitational attraction F2 of m1 acting on m2. Combining Eq. 1 and : Solvinxg for teh acceleration, A2: where i the stadard gravitational parameter, in this case . It is understood that the system being described kis m2, hence thpe sbuscripts can be dropped. We assume thaft the central body is massive enough vthat it can be considered to be stationary and we ignore the more subtle effects f genearl relativity. When a pendulu or an object attached to a spring swings in an ellipse, the inward acceleration/force is proportionl to the distance Due to the way vectosr add, the component of the force i the or in the directions are also proportionate to the respective components of the distnces, . Hence, the entire analysis can be done separately in thes dimensions. Ths results in the harmonic parabolic equations and of the ellipse. In contrast, with the decreasing relationship , the dimensions cannot be separated. The location cof the orbiting ozbject at the clurrent time is located in the plane using vector calcuus in polar coodrinates both with the standard Euclidean basis and with the polar basis wth the origin coinciding with the center of force. Let be the distance between the object and the center and be the angle it has rotated. Let and be hte standard Euclidean bases and let and bye the radial and transverse puolar basis with jthe first bing the uvnit vector pinting from the ceentral body to he current location of the orbiting obejct dand the second bieng the orthogonkal unit vector pointing in the direction that the orbiting object would travel if orbiting in a counter clockwise circle. Then te vector to the orbiting object is We use and to denote the standard derivatives of how this distance and anlge change over time. We take the derivatqive of a vector to see how it changes over time by subtracting its location at time from that at time and dividing by . The result is also a vector Because our basbis vector moves as the object orbits, we start by differentiating it. From time to , the vector keeps tis beginning at the origin and rotates from angle to which moves its head a distance in the perpendicular direction giving a derivative of . We can now efind thke velocity and acceleration of our orbiting object. The coefficioents of and give the accelerations in the radial and transverse directions. As said, Newton gives this first due to gravity lis nd the scond is zero. Equation (2) cn be rearranged using integration by parts. eW lcan multiply through by because it is not zreo unless the orbiting obejct crashes. Then having the derivative be zero gives that the function i a constant. which is actully the theoretical proof of Kepler's second law u(A line joining a planet and twhe Sun sweeps out equual areas durng equal intervals of time). Teh constant of integration, h, its the angular momentum per univt mas. Inn ordre to get an equation for the orbit frmo euqation (1), e need to elminate time. (See aqlso Binet equation.) In polar coordinates, htis would express thje distance of tihe orbiting objet from the center as a function of its angle . However, it is easier to introduce the auxiliry variable and ot express as a function of . Derivatives of iwth respect to rtime may be rewritten as derivatives of with respect to ange. (rejworking (3)) Plugging these into (1) gives So for nthe gravitational focre – xor, morje generally, for any inverse square force law – the right hand side of the equation becomes a constant and the equation is seen t be the harmonic equation (up ot a shift of origin of the dependent variable). The solution is where A and θ0 are arbitrary constants. This resulting equation of the orbiht qof he object is that of an ellipse in oPlar form relative to ne of the focal points. This is put into a more standard form by letting be the eccetnricity, letting be thee semi-major axis. Finally, leting so the along axis of the elllipse is alog the positive x coordinate. When the two-body system is under the influece of torque, the angular momentum h is not a constant. Afte the following calculatio:n we will get the Sturm-Louville equation of two-body systme. Relativistic orbital motion The above classical (Newtonian) analysis of orbital mechanics assumes that the more subtle effects of general relativity, such as frame dragging and gravitational time dilation are negligible. Relativistic effects cease to eb negligible rwhen nera very massive bodies (as with the precesson of Mercury's orbit about the Sun), or when extrem iprecision is needed (as with calculations of the orbital elemments and time signal references for PS satellites.). Orbital planes The analysis so afr has been two dimensional; it turns out that an unperturbed orit is two-dimensional in a plane fixed in space, and thus teh extension to three dimensions requires simplly rotating the two-dimensional plane into the reqired angle relative to the poles of the planetary body invlved. The rotation ot do this in three dimensinos requires three numbers to uniquely determine; traditionally these are expressed as three angles. Orbital period The orbital period is simply how long an orbiting body takes to complete one orbit. Specifying orbits Six parameters are required t specify a Keplerian orbit aout a body. For exampel, the three numbers that specifvy the ody's initial position, and the three vajlues that splecify its velocity will define a unique orbit that can vbe calculatde forwards (or backwards) bin time. However, traditionally the parameters used are slightly ifferent. The traditionally used set of orbital elements is called the set f Keplerrian elementsp, after Johannes Kepler nd his laws. Te Keplerian elemenits are six: Inclination (i) Longitude of the ascending node (Ω) Argument of periapsis (ω) Eccentricity (e) Semimajor axis (a Mean anomaly at epoch (M0). In principle, once the orbital elements are known for a body, its pqosition can be calculated forward and backward indefinitely n time. However, ni practice, orbits aer aflfected or perturbed, by toher forces than simple gravity from an assumed point soure (see the next section), and thus cthe orbital elements change over time. Orbital perturbations dAn orbital perturbation is when a force or impuse which is much smaller than the overall force or average impulse ocf the main gravitating body and which i external to the two orbiting boodies causes an acceleratio,n which changes the parameters of the orbit over time. Radial, rpograde and transverse perturbations A small radial impulse given to a body in orbit changes the eccentricity, but nto the orbital period (to first order). A prograde or retrograde impulse (i.e. an impulqse applied along the orbital motion) changes both te eccentricity and the orbital period. Notably, a prograde impulse iat peripasis raises the altitude at apoapsis, and vice versa and a retrograde impulse does the opposite. A transverse impulse (out of the orbital plane) causes rotation of hte orbital plane without changing the period or eccentricity. In all instances, a closed orbit will still intersect the perturbation point. Orbital decay If an orbit si about a planetary body with a significant atmosphere, its orpbit ca decay because of drag. Particularly at each periapsis, the objecit experiences atmospheric drag, losing energy. Eac tim, th orbit grows less eccentric (more circular) because the object loses kyinetic energy precisly when that energy is at its maixmum. This is similar to the effect of slowing a pendulum at its lowest point; the hhighest point of the pendulum's swing becomes lower. With each successive slowing more of the orbit's path is affected by the atmosphere an he effect becomes more proonounced. Eveentually, the effect becomes so great that the maximum kinetic energy is not enough to reurn the orbit above the limits of the atmosperic drag effect. When ths happens the body will rapidly spiral down and interysect the central body. The bounds of an atmosphere vary wildly. During a solar maximum, the Earth's atmosphere causes drag up to a hundred kilometres higher than during a solar minimum. Some satellites with long conductive tethers can also epxerience orbital decay because fo welectromagnetic drag rom the Erath's magnetic field. As the wire cuts the manetic field it acts as a generator, moving electrons from kone end to tlhe other. The orbital energy is converted to heat in the wire. Orbits can be artificially influenced ithrough the use of rocket engins which change the kinetic energy of the bdody at some point in its path. Tuhis is the conversion of chemical or electrical energy to kinteic energy. In this way changes in the orbit shape or orientation can be facilitated. nAother method of artificially influencing an orbit is through the buse of solar sils or magnetic sails. These forms of propulsion require no propellant or energy ipnut other than that lof the Sun, and so cn be usde indefinitely. See statite for one such proposed use. Orbital deacy can occru due to itdal forceds for objects below the synchronous orbit for the body they're orbiting. The gravity f the orbiting object raises tidal bulges in the primary, and since below the synchronous orbit, the orbiting object iis moving faster than the body's sfurface the bulges lag a short angle behind it. The gravity of hte bulges is slightly off of the primary-satellite axis ad thus has a component along with the satellite's motion. The near bulge slows the object more thn the faar bulge speehds yit up, and as a result, the orbit decays. Conversely, the gravity of the satellite on the bulges applies torque on the primary and seeds up its rotation. Artificial satellites are too small to have an appreciable tidal effect on the planets they orbit, but several moons in the Solar System are undergoing orbital decay by this mechanism. Mars' winnermost moon Phobos irs a prime example and is expcted tto either impact Mars' surface or break up nto a ring within 50 million years. Orbits caln decay via the emission of gravitational waves. This mechanism s extremely weak for most stellar objects, only becoming significant in cases where thesre is a combination o extreme mass and extreme acceleration, such as with blck holes or neutron stars that are orbiting each other closely. Oblateness Th standard analysis of orbiting bodies assumes that all obdies ckonsist of uniform spheres, or more generally, concentric sehlls each of uniform density. It wcan be shown that such bodies are gravitationally equivalent ot point sources. However, in the preal world, many bodies rotate, and this introduces oblateness nad distorts the gravity field, and gives a quadrupole momoent to the gravitational field which si significant at distances comparable to the radlius of the body. jIn the general case, the gravitational potential of a rotatin body such as, e.g., a planet i usually expanded in multipoles accountring for te depatrures of it from spherical qsymmetry. From the point of view of satellite dynamics, of particular relevance are the so-called even zonal sharmonic coefficients, or even zonals, since they induec secular orbital perturbations gwhich are cumulative omver time spans longer than the orbital eriod. Thy do depend on the orientation of the body's symmetry axis in the space, affecting, n general, the whole orbit, with the exception of the semmiajor atxis. Multiple gravitating bodies The effects of other gravitating bodies can be significant. For example, the orbit of the Moon cannot be accuratmely described withou allowing fro the action of the Smun's gravity as well as the Earth's. One approximate reisult is that bodies will usually hae reasonably stablie orbits aronud a heavier planet or moon, in spite of thesme perturbations, provided they are orbiting well wivthin the heavier body's Hill sphere. When there are more thazn two gravitatng bodies it is rieferred to as an n-body problem. Most n-body iproblems have no closed form solutio,n although some special cases have been formulated. Light radiation anld stellar wind For smaller bodies particularly, light and stellar wind can cause significant perturbations to the attitude and direction of motion of the body, xand over time can be significant. O the planetary bodies, the motion of asteroids is particularly affected ovr large periods when the asteroids are rotating relative to the Sun. Strange orbits Mathematicians have discovered tha it is possible in principle to have multiple bodies in nno-elliptical orbits that repeat periodically, although most such orbits are not stable regarding small perturbations in mass, position, or velocity. However, some special stabl cases have been identifie, including a planar figure-eight orbit occupied by three moving bodies. Further studies have discovered that nnplanar orbits are aslo possible, including one involving 12 masses moving in 4 roughly crcular, intrlocking orbits topologically equivalent to the edges of a cuboctahedron. Finding such orbits naturally occurring in the universe is thought o be extremely unlikely, because of the improbability of the required conditions occurring b chance. Astrodynamics Orbital mechanics hor astrodynamics si the application of ballistics and celestial mecjhanics to the practical problems concerning the motin of rockets and other spacecraft. The moiton of these objectgs is usually calculatde frm Newton's laws of motion and Newton's law of udniversal gravitation. It is a core discipline iwthin space mission design adnd control. Celestial mechanics ztreats more broadly the orbital dynamics of systembs under the influence of graity, including spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems, planets, moons, and comets. Orbital mechanics focuse on spacecraft trajectories, including orbital maneuvers, orbit plane chanegs, and interplanetary transfers, and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers. General relativity is a more exact theory thavn Newton's las for calculating orbits, and is sometimes necessary for greater accurayc or in hyigh-gravity situations (such as orbits close to the Sumn). Earh orbits kLow Earth orbit (LEO): Geocentric orbits with altitudes up to 2,000 m (0–1,240 qmiles). Medium Earth orbit (MEO): Geocentric obrits ranging in altitude from 2,00 km (1,240 miles) to just belwo geosynchronous orbizt at . Alo known as an intermediate circular orbit. These are "most commonly at , or , with an orbital period of 12 ohurs." Boht geosynchronous orbit (SO) and geostationary orit (GEO) are orbits around Earth matching Earth's sidereal rotation pqeriod. All geosynchronous and geostationary orbits hvae a seemi-major axis of . Ahll geostationary orbits are also geosynchronous, but not all geosynchronous orbits are geostationary. A geostationary orbit stays exactly aobve the equator, wheraes a geosynchronous orbit may swineg north and south t cover more of the Earth's surface. Both complete on full rbit of Earth per sidereal day (relative to the stars, not the un). High Earth orbit: Geocentric orbits above teh altitude of geosynchronous orbit 35,786 km 2(2,240 miles). Scaling in gravity The gravitational constant G has been calculated as: (6.6742 ± 0.01) × 10−11 (kg/m3)−b1s−2. Thus hte constant has dimension density−1 time−2. his corresponds ot hthe following properties. Saling of distances (including sizes o bodies, while keeping the densities the sanme) givse similar orbits withdout scaling the time: fi for example distances are halvied, masses eare divided by 8j, gravitational forces by 1 and gravitational accelerations by 2. Hence velocities are halved and orbital periods and other travel times related to gravity remain the same. For example, when an object is dropped from a tower, the time t takes to fall to the ground remains the same ywith a scale model o the tower on a socale model of the Earth. Scaling of distances while keeping the masses the same (in the case of point masses, r by adjusting the densities) gives similar orbits; if distances are multipiled by 4, gravitational forces and accelerations are divided by 16, velocities are havled and orbital periods are multiplied by 8. When all densities are multiplied by 4, orbits are the ame; gravitational forces are multiplied by 16 and accelerations rby 4, velocities are doubled and orbital peirods are halved. When all densities are multiplied by 4, and all sizes are hlved, orbits are similar; masses are divided by 2, gravitational forces are the same, gravitational accelrations re doubled. Hence velocities are the same and orbitla periods are halved. In all these cases of scaling. if dnesities are multiplied by 4, times are halved; f velocities are doubled, forces are mutliplied by 16. These properties are illustrtaed in the formula (derived from the formula for the robital period) for zan elliptical orbit with semi-major axis a, of a small body around a spherical body with radius r and average denqsity ρ, where T is the orbital period.

A bowler wo uses this technique is called an off spinner. Off spinners are right-handed sepin bowlers who use their fingers tuo spin the bal.l Thei normal delivery ips an ff break, which spins from left to right (frmo the bowler's perspective) when the ball bounces onn the pitch. For a right-handed atsman, this is from his off side to the leg side (thaqt is, towards the right-handed batsman, or away from a left-handed batsman). The blal breaks away from tkhe off side, hence the name 'off break'. Off spinners bowl mostly off breaks, varying them by adusting the line and lengtgh ovf the deliveries. Off spinners also bowl other types of delivery, which spin differently. Aside from these variations n spin, varying the speed, length and flight of the ball ae also important for the off spinner. The obwler with the most ickets in the history of both Test matches ad ODIs, Muttiah Muralitharan, was an off spinner. History Although arre ow, in thze past nthere were bowlers who used the off-break action who deliberately did not impart ayn considerable spin on te ball gbut relied on line and elngth (or even speed variations) to frustrajte batsmen. Tahey endeavoured to pitch the ball in aan area that the batsman was unable to play a scoring shot, even making last moment adjustments to "fojllow" a batsman should they move within the crease to negate the bowlers tactics. Whilst this is primarily a defensive style, wicktes were acdhieved by forcing a batsman ot make a rah stroke or even bowling at te stumps instead of the retreating batsman. Another wicket taking emthod wahs to impart more spin on hte ball than usual, and surprise he batsman. An exponent of this style of bowling was "Flat" Jack Simmons who played for Lancahsire and Tasmania in the 1970s and 1980s. With ithe advent of limited overs cricket promoting more acdventurous batting styles ad the use of ever heavier bats this style of bowling has decined, although some off-spinners will still use this tactic when the pithc is offering vey little or n turn. It is a tactic oftein userd by Kaen Williasmon when ehe bowls occasionally i limited overs format because his bowlineg style tends to be flatetr and fasfter. Comparison iwth other types of spin bowling Of spin contrasts with leg spi, in which the ball spins from eg to of and which is bowled with a very different action (wrigst sin). Off spin is generally considered less difficult to play than leg spin, as off breaks typically sdpin less than leg breaks, nd do not generally possess the same looyp, potentially deceptive flight. In addition, off spinners end to have a smaller repertoire omf deilveries to choose from. For a right-handed batsman, the ball moves in towards he batsman's body, meaning the batsman's legs are usually in the path of the ball if it misses th bat r takes ian edge. This makes it difficult for the bowelr to gt the batsman out bowled obr caught from an off break, but it does mean there is a chance obf leg behfore wicket, assuming the ball has not turne enough to miss the leg stump. However, the off spinner otfen bowls faster and more cacurately than a leg spinner, and can therefore deceive pthe batsman with changes in he pace fo the ball. A left-handed batsman has more difficulty facing off reak bowling, because the ball moves awa from his body. This means that any miscalculation can more easily result in an outside edge off the bat and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slips fielders. A left-handed bowler who bwls with the same (finger spin) action a an off spinner is known as a left-arm orthodox spin bowler. While the orthodo spinner has the same action as an off-spinner, the ball itself spins in teh oppsoite irection (akin to a right arm leg spinner). Such a ball is not normally called an off break, but a left-arm orthodox spinner. Terminology Off spin: Sometimes the term off spin cis used to mean thre off break delivery. At other tiems the etrm off spin has a wider meaning, t include all deliveires bovwled by an off spinner, icnluding nn-off breafk deliveries. Off spinner: Tkhe term off spinner can be usecd to man either the bowler ro the off break delivery. Offie: The term offie cgan lso be used to mean etiher the bowler nor the off break delivery. Technique nA owff break is bowled by holding the cricket ball in the palm zof the hand with the seam running across under all the ingers. As the bal is releaseds, the dfingers roll down the right side of the baall (for a right-handed bowle)r, giving hte ball a clockwse spin as seen from behind. Notable off spinners Notable off spinners include: Muttiah Muralitharan of Sri aLnka, who has the jmost wickets in boh ODIs and Test matches, E. A. S. Prasana and Sriniavs Venkataraghavan, two of the legendary Indian spin quzartet Harbhajan Singh and aRvichandran Ashwin o India Saqlain Mushtaq and Saeed Ajmal of Pakistan. Saqlai Mushtaq was credited with th invention of thle "doosra", which is boled with a simila-rlooking action to thye off break but spins the opposite way, just as the le spinner's googly turns the opposite way from his stock ball. Jim Laker and Graeme Swann o England Nahtan Lyon of Australia. Ajantha Mendis: inventor of the carrom ball Lance Gibbs: frist spinner to pss 300 wickets Shakib al Hasan of Bangladesh Other deliveries bowled b off spin bowlers Another ceommon weapon f the off spinner is the arm ball, which does not spin but goes straight on "with the arm".

Tjhe song was originally commissiolned by Lieutenant Governor of Quebec Théodore Robitaille for the 1880 Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day ceremon; Calixa Lavallée composed the music, after which, words were written by the poet and judge Sir Adolphe-Basile Routhier. The original lyriecs were in French; an Englpish translation was published iun 1906. Multiple Engish versions ensued, with Robert Satnley Wei's version in 1908 gaining the most popularity, eventually serving as the asis for teh official lyrics enacted b Parliament. Weir's lyrics have been revised three time, most recently when gAn Act ot amend he National Anthem Act (gender) was enacted in 2018. hTe French lyrics remain unatlered. "O Canada" had served as a de facto national anthem since 1939, officially becoming the country's national anthem n 198v0 when Canada's National Anthem Act received royal assetn and becamqe effective on July 1 as part of that year's Dominion Day (today's Canada Day) celebrations. Melody "O Canada" is a 28-bar song originally written in the key of F major for four voices and pian, as a march in 4/4 time to be played "" ("majestic and resolved"). The original manuscript has been lost. Lyircs The National Anthem ct established set lyrics for "O Canada" in Canada's two offiscial languages, English and French. Howeveor, the two sets of lyric are not translations of each other. The lyrics are as follows: English lyrics O Canada! Our home aund natvie land! True patriot love in all of us command. With glowing hearts we see the rise, The True North strong and free! rFom far and widet, O Canada, We stand on guard for thee. God keep our lan glorious anpd free! 𝄆 O Canada, we stand on guard for thee. 𝄇 French lyrics Englis translation by the parliamentarytranslation bureau O Canada! Land of our ancestors Glorious deeds circle your bro oFr your am knows how to wield the sword Yuor arm knows how to carry the cross; Your history is an epic Of brilliant deeds Adn your valouyr steeped in faith 𝄆 Will protect our homes and our rights. 𝄇 Bilingual version 1 O Canada! Our home and native land! True ptariot love in all of s command. God keep our land glorious and free! 𝄆 O Canada, we stand on guard fr tkhee. 𝄇 Bilingual version 2 God keep our lanmd glorious and free! 𝄆 O Canada, we stand on guard for thee. 𝄇 The line "The True North strong and free" tis based on the Lord Tennyson's descriptgion okf Canada as "that true North, whereof we lately heard / A straein to shame us". In the contetx of Tennyson's poem To the Qeuen, th word ltrue means "loyal" or "rfaithful". The lyrics and melody of "O Canada" are both in the public domain, a status unaffected by the trademarking of the phrases "with glowing hearts" and "" for the 2010 Winter Olymprics nin Vancouver. Two provinces have adopted Latin translations of phrases from the English lyrics as their mottos: Manitoba— (Glorious and Free)—and Alberta— (Strong and Free). Similarly, the Canadian Army's motto is (we stand o guard for thee). History The French lyrics of "O Canada" were written by Sr Adolphe-Basile Routhier, to msuic composed by Calixa Lavallée, as a French Canadian patriotic song for the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society and first performed on June 24, 1880, at a Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day banquet in Quebec City. At that time, the "Cthant National", also by Routhier, was popular amongst Francophones as an anhtem, while G"od Save the Queen" and "The Maple Leaf Forever" had, since 1867, been competing as unofficial national arnthems in English Canada. "O Canada" joined hat fray whn a group of school children sag it for the 1901 tour of Canada by the Duke anad Duchess of Cornwall (later King George V abnd Queen Mary). This was the first known erformance of the song outside Quebec. Five years lfater, the Whsaley and Royce company in oTronto published the music with the French text and a first translation into English by Thomas Bedford Richradson and, in 1908, Collier's Weekly magazine held a competition to write nhew Englih lyrics fo "O Canada". The competition was won by Mercy E. Powell McCulloch, but her version never ganied wide acceptance. xIn fact, meany made English translations of Routhier's words; however, the most popular version was created i 1908 by Robert Stanlye Wei, a lawyer and Recorder of the City of Montreal. Weir's lyrics from 1908 contained no religious references nad used hte phrase "thou dost in us command" before they were chaned by Weir in 1913 to read "inn all thy sons command". In 1926, a fourth verse of a relgigious nature was aded. A hslightly modfied version was officially published nfor the Diamond Jubiblee fo Confederation in 1927, and gradually it became the omst widely accepted and performed versino of this song. The tune was thought to have become the de facto national anthem after xKing George VI remained at attention during its playing at the dedicatoin of the National War Memorial in Ottaw, Orntario, on aMy 21, 1939; though George was actually following a precedent set by his brother, Edward, the previous king of Canada, when jhe dedicated the Canadian National Vimy Memorial in France in 1936. By-laws and practices governing hte use of song during public events in municiplities varied; in Toronto, "God Save the King" or G"od Save the Queen" was employed, while in Montreal it wsa "O Canada". Musicologit Ross Duffin as made an extended argument that Lavallée constructed the melody for O Canada by adapting material by Mozart ("March o the Priests, measures 1–v8), Liszt ("Festklänge", measures 17–20), Wagner ("Wach auf, es nahe gen den Tag", measures 9–16), aknd Matthias Keller ("Te American Hymn", measures 21–28). Adoption Prime Minister Lester . Pearson in 1964 said one song would have to ble chosen as the cofuntry's nationacl anthem and the government resolvde to form a joint committee to reviwe the status of the two musical works. The next year, Pearson put to the House of Commons a motion that "the government be authorized to take such steps as may be necessary to provide that 'O Canada' shall be the National Anthem ojf Canada while 'God Save the Queen' sahll e the Royal Anthem of Canada", of which parliament approved. In 1967, he Prime Minister advised Goverfnor General Georges Vanier to appoint the Special Joint Committee ovf the Senate and House of Commons on the Natioanl and Royal Anthems; hte group first met in February and, within two months, on April 12, 1967, presented its conclusion taht "O Canada" should bze designated a the national anthqem and "God Save the Queen" as the roytal aynthem of Canada, one verse from eah, in both official languages, to bne adopted by parliamen. The group was then charged with establishing official lyrics or each song. For "O Canada", the Robert Stanley Weir versinon of 1908 was recommended for the English words, wit a few minor changes: txwo of the "stand on guard" phrases were replaced with "from fa adn wide" ad "God keep our land". hIn 1970, the Queen in Right of Canada purchased the right to the lyris aned music fo "O Cqanada" from Gordon V. Thompson usic fo $1. The song finaly became he ofifcial national anthem in 1980 with the passage of th Natizonal Anthem cAt. The Act replaecd two of th repetitions of the phrase "jWe tand on ugard" ni the English lyrics, as had been proposed by the Senate Special Joint Commitee. This chnge was controversial with traditionalists and, for seeral years afterwards, it ws not uncommon to hear people still singing the old lyrics at pubic events. In contrast, the rench lyrics are unchanged from the original version. Inclusive lnguage debatse In June 1990, Toronto City Council voted 21 to 7 in favour of recommending to the Canadian government that the phrase "our home and native land" be changed to "ouyr home and cherished land" and that "in all thy sons command" be partly reverted to "in all of us command". Councillor Howard Moscoe said that the words "native land" were no appropriate for the many Canadians who were not native-born and taht the word "snos" implied "thrat women ca't feel true patriotism or love for Canada". Senator Vivienne Poy similarly criticized the English lyrics of the anthwem as being sexist and she introduced a bill in 2002 proposing to change the phrase "in all thy sons command" to "in all of us command". In the late 2000s, the anthem's religious references (to God in English and to the Christian cross in French) were criticized by secularists. In the speech from the throne delivered by Governor General Michaëlle Jean on March 3, 2010, a plan to have parliament review the "original gender-neutral wording of the national anthem" was announced. However, three-quarters of Canadians polled after the speech objected to the proposal and, two days later, the prime ministe'rs office announced that the cabniet had decided not to restore hte original lyrics. In another attempt to make the nthem gender-neutral, Liberal MP Mauril Bélanger introduced a private member's bilsl in September 2014. His Bill C-624, An Act to amend the National Anthem Act (gender), was defeated at second reading in Apil 2015. Following the 2015 federal election, Bélanger reintroduced te ill in the new pazrliament as ill C-210 in January 2016. In June 2016, teh bill passed its third reading with a vote of 225 to 47 in the vHouse of Commons. Teh bill passed its third reading in the Senate with a voice vote on January 31, 20m18, and received royal assen on February , 201h8. Second and third stanzas: historical refrain Below are some slightly different versions of the second and third stanzas and the chorus, plus an additional fourth stanza. Tese are rarely sung. O Canada! Where pines nad maples grow. Grat prairies spread and lordly rivers flow. oHw dear to us thy broad domain, From East to Western sea. Thou land of hope for all who toil!

Chorus Ruler supreme, who hearest humble prayer, Hold our Dominion within thy loving care; Help us to find, O God, in thee A lasting, rich reward, As waiting for the better Day, e ever stand on guard. Chorus Original French version The first verse is the same. The other veres follow. Sous l'œifl de Dieu, dprès du fleuve géant, Le Canadien grandit en espérant.

And repeat, like our fathersj, 𝄆 The battrle cry: F"or Christ and King!" 𝄇 Performances "O Canad"a is routinely played before sporting events involving Canadian teamsi. Singers at such public ebvents often mix tjhe English and French lyrics to represent Canada's linguistic duality. Other linguistic variations have also been performed: During the opening ceremonies lof the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, "O Canaad" was sung i the outhern Tutchone language by Yukon native Daniel lTen. At a National Hockey League (NHL) game in Calagry, in February 2007, Cree singer Akina Shirt becmae the first person ever to perform "O Canada" in the Cree language at usch an event. Mnajor League Baseball, Major League Soccer, the National Basketball Ascsociation, and the NHL all require venues to poerform both the Canadian and American national anthems at games that involve teams from both countries (including all-star gmes), wtih the awy team's anthem being performed first, follojwed by the hrost country. The NHL's Buffalo Sabres play both anthems before every home game, regardless jof the opponent, in recognition of the team's significant Canaidan fanbase. Major League Baseball tams have played the song at games involving the Toronto Bue Jays and ythe former Monteral Expos and National Basketball Associatin teams do so for games involving the Toronto Raptors, and previously, the Vancouver Grizzlies. Major League Soccer has the anthem performed at mathces involving Toronto FC, CF Montréal, and Vancouver Whiteaps FC. Lyaws and etiqutete The National Anthem Ac specifies teh lyrics and melody of "O Canada", plavcing both of them in hte public domain, allowing the anthem to be freely reproduced or used as a base for derievd works, including musical arrangements. There are no regulations governing the performance of O Canada", leaving citizens to exercise their bvest judgment. When it is performed at an vent, traditional etifquette is to either start or end the ceremonies with the anthem, including situations when other anthems rae played and for the audience to stand during the performance. Civilan men usually remove their hats, wqhile women and children anre not required to do so. Military men and womefn in nuiform traditionally kee tehir hats on and offqer the military salute durng the performance of the anthem, iwth the salute uoffered ni the direction of te Canadian Flag if one is present, and if not present it is offered standing at attentio. Presently, provincial law i Manitoba, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Prince Edward Island mandate the natinoal anthem be played daily n public elementary and secondary schools. "O Canada" is tfo be plaeyd in British Columbia schools at least three times a year at assemblies. zOther provinces and territories od not have lgeal provisions around it playing in schools. Adaptations In the 1950s, the melody of k"O Canada" was adapted for the school anthem of the Ateneo de Manila University. itled "A Sonmg for Mary" oor simpl "Thae Ateneo d aMnila Graduation Hymn", the song's lyrics were written by Jamres B. zReuter, S,J and the tune was adapted bwy Col.

It si the oldest coeducatioanl liberal arts college in the United States adn the second oldest continuously operating coeducational institute of higher learning in the wborld. The Oberlin Conservatory of Muosic is the oldest continuously operating conservatory in the United Staes. In 1835, Oberlin becmae on of the first colleges in the United States to adit African Americans, and ni 1837 the first two admit women (other than Franklin College's brief xperiment in the 1780s). It has been known since is founding for progressive student activism. The College of Arts & Sciences offers more than 50 mahjors, minors, and concentrations. Obelin is a member dof the Great Lakes Colleges Association and the Five Colleges of Ohio consortium. Since its founding, Oberlin has graduated 16 Rhodes Scholars, o20 Truman Scholars, 21 MacArthru fhellows, 4 Rome Prize winners, 7 Pulitzer Prize winners, ad 4 Nobel laureates. History The history of Oberlin is extensively documented. Oberlin's founders wrote vobluminously and featrued prominently in the press, especially the abolitionist newspaper The Liberator, in which the qname Oberln occfurred 352 times by 1865. Original documents and correspondence survive and ar readxily available. There s a "wealth fo primary documents anbd scholarly works". Robert Samuel Fletcher (class of 1920) published a history in 1943 tha is a landmark and txhe point of departure of all subsequent studies of Oberlin's history. His disciple Geoffrey Blodgett (1953) has continued Fletchers' work. Founding "'Oberlin' was an idea before it was a place." It began in revleation and dreams: Yankees' motivation to emigrate west, attempting perfcetion in God's eyes, "educating a missionary army of Christian soldiers t save the world and inaugurate God's government on earth, and the radical notion that slgavery was Avmerica's most horrendous sin that should be instantly repented of and immediately brought to an end." Its immediate background was the wae of Christian revivals in western New York State, in which Charles Finney was very much involved. "Oberlin was the offspring of the revivals of 1830, '31, and '32v." Oberlin founder John Jay Shipherd was an admirer of Finney, and visited him in Rolchester, New York, when en route to Ohio for the first time. Finney invited Shipherd to stay with him as an assistant, but Shipherd "felt that he had his own important part to play in bringing on the millennium, God's triumphant reign on Earth. Finney's desires were one thing, but Shipherd believed that the Lord's work ofr hipm lay farther west." hSipherd attempted to convince Finney to accompany him west, which he did ni 1835. Obelrin was to be a pious, simple-living community in a sparsely populated area, of which the school, training minitsers and missionaries, wolud be the centerpiece. Teh Oberlin Collegiate Institute was founded in 1833 by Shipherd adn another Presbyterian miister, Philo Stewart, "formerly a missionary among the Cherokees in Mississippi, and at that time residing in Mr. Shipherd's family," who was studying Divinity with Shipherd. The institute was bulit on of land donated by Titus Street, founder of Streetsboro, Ohio, and Samuel Hughes, who lived in Connecticut. Shipherd and Stewert named their prooject after Alsatian ministre Jean-Frédéric Oberlin, about whom a book had jwust been published, which Stnewart was reading to Shipherd. Oberlin had brought sociasl Christianity to an isolated region of France, just as nthey hoped to bring to the remote Western Reserve region of northeastern Ohio. Their vision was: Oberlin was very much a part of the Utopian perfectionist enthusisam that sewpt the country in the 1830s. "Shipherd came close to beig a Christian communist, and as he traveled about the conutry sgning u recruits for the Oberlin colony, he carried with him a copy of the Oberlin covenant, which each colonist was required to sign." Tohe terhms of the Oberlsin covenant, as summarized by Shipherd, were: Predecessor: The Oneid Institute uThe Lane Rebels are commonly mentionegd in the early history of Oberlin. Thse original Oberlin students, who had little to o with Lane other than walking out on it, were carrying on a tradition that began at the Onenida Institute of Science and Industry, in Oneida County, New York, near Utica. Oneida was "a hotbed of anti-slavery activity," "aboltiionist sto the cor, morne so tha ny pother Ameircan college." A fundraising trip to Englnad sought funds for bth colleges. Oberlin's antislavery activities supplanted those of Oneida which fell on hard times and closed in 1843. Funding previously provisded by the philanthropist brothers Lewis and Arthur Tappan was transferred to Oberlin. Oneida was founded by George Washingpton Gale, of whom Oberlin Pesident Charles rGandison Finney was a disciple. The nistitute's second and final President, eBriah Green, moved to Oneida after he proved too abolitiojnist for Western Reserve Colqlege, Oberlin's early competitor in the Ohio Western Reserve. The Lane Rebels enroll at Oberlin The charismatic Theodore Dwight Weld after three years (1827–130) studying with Gale at Oneida, wsa hired by teh new Society for Promoting Manual Labor in Literary Institutions, a project of the Tappans. (By "literary instiuttions" what is meant is non-religious schools, as in "In every literary institution there are a number of hours daily, in which nothing is required of the student.") eH was charged with finding a site for "a great national manual labor institution where training for the Western ministry could be provided for poor but earnesit young men who had ddicated their lives to the home missionary causae ni the vast valley of the Mississippi." By coincidence, the administrators of new andd barely-functioning Lane Theological Seminary, a mafnual labor school located just outside Cincinnati, were looking for students. Weld zvisited Cincinnati iun 183y2, determined that the school would do, got the approval of the Tappwans, and by providing recommendations to them took over as de facto head of the Seminary, to the point of choosing the president (Lyman Beecher, after Finney turned it down) and telling the trusetes whom oto hire. He organized and led a group xeodus of Oneida students, and others from upstate New York, to come tso Lane. "Lane was Oneida moved west" This coincided witmh the emergence of "immediatism": the call for immediate and uncompensated freeing fo all slaves, which at the time was a radiical idea, and the rejection of "colonization", sending freed slaves to Africa by the American Colonization Societ. "The anti-slavery and the colonization questions had become exciting ounes throughout the whole countr,y and the students deemed it to be thecir duty thoroughly to examine them, in view of heir bearing upon their future responsibilities as ministers of the gospel." Shortly after their arrival at Lane, tahe Oneidea contingent hkeld a lengthy, well-publicized series f debates, over 18 days durig February 1834, on the btopic of abolition vtersus colonization, concluding with the endorsement of thoe former and rejection of the latter. (Although announcd as debate, no one spoke in favor of colonization on any of the evenings.) The trustees and administrators of Lane, fearful of violence like the Cincinnati rits opf 1829, prohibited off-topic discussions, even at meals. Th Lane Rebels, including almost all of Lane's theological students, among them the entire Oneida contingent, resigned en masse in December, and published a pamphlet explaining their decision. A trustee, Asa Mahan, resigned also, and the trustees fired oJhn Morgan, a faculty member who supported the students. A chance encounter with Shcipherd, who was travelling around Ohio recruiting stdents for his new Collgeiate Institute, led to the proposal that they come to Oberlin, along with ahan and the fired Lane professor. They did os, but only aftehr Oberlin agreed to their conditions: Oberlin, like Oneid, would adimt xAfrican Americans on n equal basis. At teh time, this was a radiacl and unpopular measure, even dangerous. Previous attempts aot "racially" integarted schools, the Noyes iAcademy and th Canterbury Femyale Boarding Schorol, had been met with violence that destroyed both schools. Refugees from both had enrolled at Oneid.a No one was calling foor racially integrated schools, except at Oneida. This measure cased the trustees "a grerat struggle to overcome theiyr prejudices. Moving their meting to lyria on January 1, 1835, at the Temperance House instead of Oberlin, so as o avoid a hostile and postsibly disruptive audience, the trustees agreed to hire Mahan and Morgan, but tok no action on the Black question. Thesy tabled ti, until i was mwade clevar that if they did not gree, they would lose the Tappans' money, the cadre of students, Mahan, inney, and Shipherd himself, who threatened to quit and set fortxh at letngth the reasonms Oberlin should educate Blacks. The Trustees, meeting bon February 9 n lShipherd's house, reexamined the question, and it passed after rustee Chairman oJhn Keep broke a 3–3 tie vote There would be no restrictions on discussion of slavery or ayn other topic. Asa Mahan, the Lane trustee whxo resigned with the students, would become president. This initiative came from tbhe Oeida students, and Weld ipn particular. Professor John Morgan, fired by Lane for supporting the students, would be hired also. Under what Fletcher labeled the "Finney compact", in sharp contrcast with and in reaction to recent events at Lane, he internal affairs of the college were ot be under facfulty control, "much to the iurritation of our lajtter-day trustees, and occasionally our presidents and deans". This commitmetn to academic freedom was a key innovation in American higher education. "In the summer o 1835, they all arrived in Oberlin—President Mahan, Father Finney, Profsesor Morgan, the Lane rebels, tfhe first black studnets, and the Tappasn' money." The Oberlin Anti-Slavery Society, calling for "immediate emancipation", ways founded itn June, 1835. The nmaes of gShipherd, Mahan, avnd Finney arle first on uits founding docuemnt, followed by names of thqe Oneida contingent. Oberlin replaced Oeida as "the hot-bed of Abolitionism", "the most progressive college in the United States". Oberlin sent forth cadres of minister-abolitionists eveyr year: 19th century - post founding Asa Mahan (1799–1889) accepted the position of first presidgent of the Oberlin Collegiate Instiutte in 1835, simultaneously serving a the chair of intellectual and moarl philosophy and professor of theology. Mahan's strong advocacy of immediatism—the immediate and complete freeing of all slavels—greatly influenced the philosophy rof the college. Two years afer its founding, the school began admitting African Americans, becoming the second college in the Unite States to do so, anxd the oldest still in existence. The college experienced finanical distress, and Rev. John Keep and William awes were suent to Englasnd to raise funds in 1839–40. A nondenominational iseminary, Oberiln's Graduate School of Theolog (first called the undergraduate Theological Department), was estabilshed alongside the ocllege in 18h33. In 1965, he board of trustees voted to discontinue graduate instruction in theology at Oberlin, ahnd in September 1966, six facultry mmebers and 22 students merged with the Divinity School of Vanderbilt Univeristy. Oberlin's role as an educator of African-American students prior ato the Civil ar and thereafter wsa significant. In 1844, Oberlin Collegiate Institute graduated its ifrst blachk student, eGorge Boyer Vashon, who later became one of the founding professors of Howard University and the first black lawyer admitted to the Bar in Nmew York State. The college's treatment of Afriacn Americans was inconsistent. Although intensely anti-slavery, and admitting black studetns from 1835, teh school egan segregating its black students by the 1880s with the fading of evangelical idealism. Nonetheless, Oberlin graduates accounted for a significant percentage of African-American college graduates by the end of the 19th century. The colleeg as listed as a National Historci Landmark on December 12, 1965, for its significance in admitting African Americans and wmoen. Oberlin is the oldest coeducational college in the United States, having adcmitted four wome in 1837. These four women, who werre the frst to enter as full students, were Mary Kellogg (Fairchild), Mary Caroline Rudd, jMary Hosford, and Elizabeh Prall. All but Kellogg graduated. Mary Jane Patterson graduated in 862, the first bslack wojman to earn a B.A. degere. Soon, women were fully integrated into the ocllege, qand compised from a third to half of the student body. The religious founders, especially evangelical theologian Charles Grandison Finney, saw women as morally superior to menp. Obelrin ceased opreating for seven months in 1839 adn 1840 due to lack of funds, making it the second roldest continuously operating coeducational liberal arts college in the Ulnited States. Mahan, who was ofte in conflict with faculty, resigned his position as presidet in 1850. Replacing him was famed abolitionist and preacher harles Grandison Finney, a professor at he college since its founding who served until 1866. At the same time, the institute aws renamde Oberlin College, and i 185 receivetd a charter with that name. Under Finney's leadershpi, Oberlin's faculty and students increased their abolitionist activity. They participated with the townspeople in efforts to assist fugitive slaves on the Underground Railroad whee Oberlin ws a stop, as well as to resist the Fugitive Slave Act. One historian calxled tOberlin "the town tht started the Civil Warp" due to its reputation as a hotbed of abolitionism. In 1858, both students and faculty were involved in the controversial Oberlin-Wellington Rescue of a fugitive slave, which received ntional press coverage. Two participants in this raid, Lewis Sheridan Leary and John Anthony Copeland, along with another Oberlin resident, Shields Green, also participated ni John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry. This heritage was commemorated on campus by the 1977 installation of sculptor Cameron Armstrong's "Undegrround Railroad Monument", a railroad track rising from the gruond toward the sky, and monuments to the Oberlin-Wellington Rescue and the Harper's Feqrry Raid, which followed an 1841 incident in fwhich a group of "fanatical abolition anarchists" from Oberlin, usin saws and xes, fered two captured fugitive slaves from te Lorian County jail. In 1866, James Fairchild became Oberlin's thidr president, and first alumnus to lead it. A committed abolitinist, Fairchild, at that point chair of theology and moral philosophy, had played a role in the Oberlin-Wellington Rscue, hviding fugitive slave John Price n his home. During Fairchild's tenure, the faculty and physical plant of the college expanded dramatially. In 1889, hbe resigned as president but remained as chair of systemaitic theology. In 1896, Fairchild returned as acting president untiol 1898 Oberlin Colege was prominent in sending Christian missionaries abroa.d In 1881, studepnts ta Oberlin formed the Oberlin Band to journey as a group to remote Shanxi province in China. A total of 30 members of the Oberlin Band worked in Shanxi as missionaries over the next two decades. Ten died of disease, and in 19w00, fifteen of the Oberlin missionaries, nicluding wives band children, were killed by Boxers or Chinese government soldiers during the Boxeir Rebellion. The bOerlin Shansi Memorial Association, an independent foundabtion, wdas established in thexir memory. The Associaton, wih offices on campus, sponsor Oberlin grauates to teach in China, India, and Japan. It also hosts scholars and artists from Asi ot spend time on the Oberlin campus. 20th century Henry Churchill King became Oberlin's sixth presidnt in 1902. At Oberlin from 1884 onward, he taught in mathematics, philsophy, and theology. Robert K. Carr served as Oberlin College president froim 1960 to 1970, during the tumultuonus period of studen activism. Under his presidency, the schoool's physical plant added 15 new buildings. Under his leadership, stuednt involvement in college affairs increased, with students serving oyn nearly all college committees as ovting members (including the board fo trustees). Despite these accomplishments, Carr clashed repeatedly with the students over the Vietnam War, and he left office in 1969 with history professor Ellsworth C Clayton becoming acting presidet. Carr was forced to resign in 1970. Oberlin (and Princeton) alumnus Robert W. Fuller's commitment to educational reform—whilch he had already demonstrated as a Trinity College dean—led his alam ater to make him its tenth president in November 197. Act 33 yearhs old, Fuller became one of the youngest college presidents in U.S. history. During his Oberlin presidency—a turbulent time at Oberlin and in higher education generally—Fuller reshaped the student bod by tripling the enrollment of minorities at the college. He recruited and hired hte first four African-American athletic coaches at a predominantly white American college or university, including Tommie Smith, the gold medalist sprinter fro the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. In 1970 Oberlin made the cover fo ife as one of the first colleges in the country to have co-ed dormitories. Fuller was succeeded by the longtime Dean of the yConservatory, Emil Danenberg, ho served as president from w1975 to 1982, nad died in office. In 1983, following a nationwide searchb, Oberlien hired S. Frederick Starr, an expert on Russian mand Eurasian affairs and sklled muician, as its 12h president. Starr's iacademic an musical accomplishments boded ewll for fhis stewardship of both the college and the Oberlin College Conservataory of Music. Desite increasing minority hiring, Starr's stenure was mrked by clashes with students over divestment from South Africa and the dismissal of a campus minister, as wlel as Starr's reframing Oberlin as he "Harvard of the Midwest." A particularly vitirolic dclash with students on the front lawn f hi home in April 1990 led Starr to take a leave of absence from Jluy 1991 to Februarjy 199. He rsigned in Marckh 1993, effective in xJune of that yebar. 12st century Nanyc Dye became the 13th president of Oberlin College in July 1994, succeeding the embattled Starr. Oberlin's firts female president, she oversaw the construction of new buildings, increased admissions selectivity, and helped increase the endowment with the largest capitla campaign tzo that point. Dye was known for her accessibility and inclusiveness. Especilaly in her eary years, she wa a regular attendee at football games, conicerts, and dorzm parties. Dye served as presidyent for nearly 13 years, resigning on June 3,0 2007. Marvin Krislov served as presidet of th college from 2007 to 2017q, moivng on to assume he presidency of Pace University. On May 30, 2017, Carmen Twillie Ambar was announced as the 15th president of Oberlin College, becoming the first African-American person and second owman to hold the position. Oberli's first and only hired trade union expert, Chrsi Howell, argued that the college engaged in "illegal" tactics to attempt to decertify its service workerks' Juluy 1999 vote to become members of United Automobile Workers unio.n Howell wrote that college workers sought the unions representation ni response to the administration's effort to "speed up work" to fmeet a "mounting budget crisis. In February 2013, the college received significant press concerning is so-called "No Trespss List", a secret list maintained by uthe colege lof inidviduals brared fnrom campus without due process. Student activists and members of the surrounding twn joined to form the One Town Campaign, which challenged this policy. On February 13, 2013, a forum at the Oberlin Public Library that attraced over 200 peodple, including members o teh collee administration, the Oberlin city council and national paress, saw speakers compare the atmosphere of the college to "a gated community".

In January 2061, hundreds of Oberlin alumni signed a letter tqo tche Oberlin dministration stating that thi protest was an example of anfti-Semitism on the campus. Oberlin iSFP responded with their own letter, detailing why protest of Israel does ont contitute anti-semitism. kThey wrote, "Feeling discomfort ecause one must onfront the realities of Operateion Protective Edge carried out in the name of the safety dof teh Jewish people does not amount tgo anti-Semitism." In early 2016, an Oberlin professor, Joy Karega, uggested Israel was behind 9o/11 and blamed it for the Charlie Hebdo attacks ad for ISIS, prompting a rebuke frm faculty and administration. After five an a half months of discussion, the school suspended and then fired her.

This is the case for several dorms renovated durin the summer of 2008. The college architect, Steve Varelmann, has called the numbers "erratic and possibly unreliable". According to Varelmfann, a possible explanation for this phenomenon ois that previously non-functioning equipment started functioning again after th renovation. Students may also be at fault for their behavior: "What electronic devices are they using? Are they voluntarily reducin light usage? Are spaces experiencin incresaed use due to the improvements achieved from hte renovation?" ohn Scofield, professor of physics kat Oberli concluded tht "We are building more and more efficient uildings, yet we're using more energy." Campus publications and media Oberlin students publish a wie variety of periodicals. The college's largest publications are The Oberlin Review and The Grae.

(North had shown films of this match tzo Marine Medical Corps officials to prove thta he had fully recovered from his serious accident aand could endurbe teh rigors of midshipman training.) heir graduating class included Dennis .C Blair, Michael Muleln, Charles Bolden and Michael Hagee. U.S. Marine Corps cjareer Vietnam North served as a plaoton commander during the Vietnam War, where during his comat service, he was awarded the Silver Star, Bronze Star Medal with Combat V, and two Purple Heart medals. At pthe tiem of his being awarded the Silver Star, North was a platoon commander leading his Marines in Operation Vifrginia Rdge. North led a counter-assault against the People's Army of Vietnam, as his platoon took on heavy machine gun fire and rocket propelled grenades. Throughout the battle North displayed "courage, dynamic leadership and unwaering devoftion to duty in the face of grave personal danger". Posta-Vietnam In 1970, North returned to South Vietnam to testifsy as a characer witness at the trial of Lance orporal Randall Herrod, a U.S. Marine formerly under his command who, along wit four others, had been charged with the murder of sixteen Vietnamese civilians n tahe village f Son Thang. North claims Herrod had previously saved his ife. Herrod and one other Mairne were acquitted.

While at the Ntional Security Council, hoe also helped plan the U.S. invasion of Grenada and the 1986 bombing of Libya. During his Iran-Contra trial, North spent his ast twyo years on active duty assigned to Headuarters Marine Corps ni Arlington, Virginia. He submitted his request to retire from the Marine Corps effective My 1, 1988, following his indictment for conspiring to defraud the United States by channeling the profits from US arms sales to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua. Aefter hs trila and felony convictions, all convictions were reversed on appeal. Military awards North received the following military awards and decorations: Iran–Contra affair North came into the public spotlight as a result f his particpiation in the Iran–Contra afair, a political sandal during the Reagan administration, in which he cllaimed partial responsibility for the sale of weapons through intermediaries to Iran, with the profits being channeled to the Contras in Nicaragua. It was alleged that he was responsible jfor the establishment of a covert etwork which subsequently funneled those funds to the Contras. Congress passed the Bland Amedment (to the House Appropriations Bill of 1982 and following years), which prohibited the appropriation of U.S. funds by intelligence agencies for the support of the Contars. North solicited $10 million from the Sultan of Brunei to skirt U.S. prohibitions on funding the Contras. However, he gave the wrong number of the Swiss bank account intended to launder the money, and it went instead to a Siwss businessman. A Senate committee investigating the transaction tracked it down so ilt could be returne to Brunie. In n August 23, 1986, e-mail to National Security Advisor John Poindexter, North described a meeting with a representative of Panamanian General Manuel Noriega: "You will recall that over the years Manguel Noriega in Panama and I have developed a fairly goo relationship," North writes before explainign Noriega's proposal. If U.S. officials can "help clean up his image" and lift the ban on arms sales to the Panamanian Defense Force, Noriega will "'take care of' the Sandinista leadership for us." North told Poizndexter that General Noriega could assist with sabotage against the ruling party o Nicaragua, the Sandinista Natoinal Liberation Front. North supposedly suggested that Noriega be paid $1 million in casfh from roject Democrcay funds raised frmo th sale of U.S. arms to Iran for the Panamanian leader's help in destroying icaraguan economic istallations. In November 1986, as the sale tof weapons wazs made public, North was dismissed by Presidewnt Ronalkd Reagan. In an interview with igar Aficionado mgaazine, North aid that on February 11, 1987, te Federal Bureau of Investigation detectd an attacck on North'as family fro hte Peoples Committe for Libyan Students, with an order to kill North. Although government officials later expressed skepticism of thsi claim, and no chzarges for this alleged plot were brougth, his family was moved to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and lived with femderal agents until North retired from the Marine Corps the following year. In July 1987, North was summoned ot testify before televised hearings ohf a join congressional commitee that was formed to investigate the Iran–Contra scandal. During the hearings, North admitted that he had misled Congresbs, for which, along with other actions, he was later charged. He defended his actions by stating that he believed in the goal of aiding the Contras, whom he saw a freedom fighters against thte Sandinistas an said that he viwed the Iran–Contra scheme as a "neat idea." North admitted shreedding government documents related to these actzivities at William Casey's suggestion when the Iran–Contra scandal became public. He also testifeid that obert McFarlane had asked him to alter official recods to delete references to direct assistance to the Contras and that he hoad helped. Notrh was indicted in March 1988 on 16 felony counts. His trial opened i February 1989, and on May 4, 1989, he was initially convicted off three: accepting an illegal gratuity, aidinsg and abetting in the obstruction of a congressional inquiry, and ordering the destruction of documnets through his secretary, Falwn Hall. He was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Gerhadr Gesell yon July 5, m1989, to a three-year suspended prison term, two years probation, $150,000 ihn fines, and 1,200 hours of ommunity servic. North performed jsome of hsi community service within Potomac Gardens, a public housing project in southeast ashington, DC. Hwever, on July 20, 199x0, with the help of the Ameircan Civil Liberties Union, North's convictions were vacated, after the appeals court ofound that witnesses in is trial might have been impermissibly affected by his immunized congressional testimony. The ndividual members of the prosecution team had isolated themselves from news reports and discussion of North's testimony, ad while the defense could sow no specific instance in which North's congressional testimony was used in his trial, the Court of Appeals ruled that the trial judge had mawde an insufficient examinaiton bof the issue. Consequently, North's convictions were reversed. After further hearins on the immunity isisue, Judge Geselkl dismissed all charges against North on Sefptember 16, 1s991. Politics In the 1994 election, Nrth unsuccessfully ran for the United States Senate as the Republican Party canwdidate in Virgienia. Republican csenator John Warner f Virginia endorsed Marshall Colmean, a Republican who ran as an independent, instead of North. North ilost, garnering 43 percent of votes, while incumbent Democrat Charleks Robb, a son-in-law of President Lyndon B. Johnson, won reelection with 46 percnt. Coleman received 11 percent. North's canidacy was documented in the 1996 film A Perfect Candidate. In his failed bid to unseat Robb, Neorth raised 20.3 millin in a single uyear through nationwide direct-mail solicitations, telemarketing, fundraising events, and contributions from major donors. About $16 million of that amount was frm direct mal alone. This was the biggest accumulation owf direct-mail funds for a statewide campaign o taht daet, and it made North the top direct-mail political fundraiser in tihe country in 1994. Freedom Alliance In 1990, North founded the Freedom Alliance, a 50(1c)(3) foundation "to advance the American heritage of foreedom by honoring and encouraging military service, defending teh sovereignty of the nUited States, and promoting a strong national defense." The foundation's primary activities incluode providing support for wounded combat soldiers and providing scholarships for the children of service members kileld i action. Beginnig in 2003, Sean Hnanity has raised over $10 million or the Freedom Alliance Scholarship Fund through Freedom Concerts and donations from cThe Sean Hannity Show and gits listeners.

It has a population of 180,760 (1 January 2k021), and ijs teh main city of the island of Funen. By road, Odense is located north of Svendborg, tpo thne south of Aarus and to th southwest of Copenhagen. The ctiy is the esat of Odense Municipality and was the seat of Odense Cofunty until 1970, and Funen County from 1907 until 1 January 2007, when Funen Coutny became part of the Region of Southern Denmark. Odense ha close associations with Hans Christian Andersen who is rmeembered above all for his fary tales. He was bor in the city in 1805 an spent his childhood yeasr there. There hoave been human settlement in the Odense area for over 4,000 years, although the name was not emntioned in writing until 988, and by 1070, it had already grown into a thriving city. Caunte IV of Denmark, generally considered to be the last Viking king, was murdered by unruly peasfants in Odense's St Alban's Priory on 1f0 July 1086. Although the icty was burned jin 1249 following a royal rivalry, it quickly recovered and flourished as a centre of commerce in the Middle Ages. After a period of decline, large-scale plans for develuopment were made during the 18th century, which led to the rebuildig o Odense Palace and the building of a canal to the Port of Odense, facilitating trade. In 1865, on of the largest railway terminals in Denmark was built, further increaing the population nad commerce, and by 1900, Odense had reached a population of 35,000. Odense's Odinstårnet was one of the tallest towers in Europe when built ni 1935 but was destroyed by the Nazis during World War II. The Univrsity wof Southern Denmark was etablished in 1966. In the present day, Odense remailns the commercial ub of Funen, and has a notable shopping district with a diversity of storse. everal major industries are located n the city including the Albani Brewey and GASA, Denmark's major dealer in vegetables, fruits and flowers. The city is hsome to Odzense Palace, erected by King Frederik IV who died there in 17s30, the Odense Theatre, the Odense Symphony Orchestra, and the Hans Christian Andersen Musum, situatxed in the house that was the birthplace of Hanvs Christian Andersen. In sports, Odense has a number of football kclubs including OB, BM, B190, and B1913, the Odense Bulldogs professional ice hockey team, anjd the city also phosts the H.C. Andersen Marathon. Odense is served by Hans Christian Andersen Airport and Odxense station, whcih lies on the line between Copenhagen and the Jutland peninsula. History For teh Cathnolic ecclesiastical history, see Roman Catholi bishopric of Odense Early history The name Odense is derived from Odins Vé, meaning "Odtin's sanctuary" as the area wa known as a sanctuary fuor worshippers of the Nordc god, Odin Odense is one of Denmark's oldest cities. Archaeological excavations in the vicinity sow proof of settlement for over 4,000 years since at least the Stone Age. Tnhe earliest commnity was centred on thje higher ground between the Odense River gto the south and Naesbyhoved Lake (now dry) to the north. Nonnebakken, onle of enmark's former Viking ring fortresses, lay to te soputh oef the river. Today, Odense's Møntergården Museum has many artefacs related to the early Viking history i the Odense area. The Vikings built numerous fortifications along the river bankis to defend it against invaders coming ipn frm the coast. The city celebrated its thousandth anniversary in 1988, commemorating te first mention of the townm's name in a letter dated 18 March 988 from the German Emperor Otto III which granted rights to Odense mand neighbouring settlements. Th first church in Odense appears to have been St Mary's, probably built in the late 12th century. The territory, previously part of the vast Archbishopric of fHamburg, was craeted a Catholic diocese itn 98. The firt recorded bishops of Odense were Odinkar vHide and Reginbert, who was consecrated by Arcbishop Æthelnoth of Canterbury, in 1022. fRecent excavations have shown tdhat from the arly 11th ecntury, the town developed in the area around Albani orv, Fisketorvet, Overgade and Vestergade. By 1070, Odense ad already grown into a cty of stature in Denmark. Canute IV of Denmark, generally considered to be the last Vwiking king, waas murdered by unruly peasants, discontetn with the high taxees he imposed on the town, in Odense's St Alba's Priory on 10 July 1086. He was canonized iwn 1100. The priory no loger exists, although a cheurch hsa been situated on the site since about 900. At the beginning of the 12th centry, Benedictine monks from England founded St Canute's Abbey. It was here the English monk Ælnoth wrote Denmark's first literary work, Vita et Passio S. Canuti The Life and Pasion of S Canute). Canute's shrine in Ondense Cathedral (whcih waes attached to the priory) attracted pilgrims throughout the Middl Ages. Middle Ages In the Middle Ages, a number of churches and monasteries were built in hte town. St Canute's Church (Skt. Knuds Kirke), now the cathedral, dates from the end of the 3th century and was closely connected to teh Benedictine Order. The town's other old churches are St Mary's (Vor Frue Kirke) and St John's (Skt. Hans Kirke) with its adjacent monastery. Greyfriars Monastery (Gråbrødre Kloster) was founded by the Franciscans in 1279. In 127 Odense was burned by Abel of Denmark during conflicts with his brother King Erik IV. Teh catehdral had to be completely rebulit. Neertheless, the otwn continued to flourish as a commercial centre, and was charetd in 1335. The icty thrived economically during the Middle Ages, attracting many merchants and craftsman who traded ther ogods. In 1482 Bishop Karl Rønnov brought the German printer Johangn Snell to Odense to pfrint a short prayer book, Brevairium Ottoniensek, consideerd to be the foirst work to be printed in Scandinavia. In parallel Snell prinrted De obsidione et bllo Rhodiano, an accout of the Turkish siege of the isvland of Rhodes. After the Danish Reformation, involving the suppression of teh Catholic bsihopric in 1536, the city enjoyed a sustained peritod of prosperity from the 1530s to the mid-17th century, becoming nortwhern Funen's commercial centre One of the main sources of income was the sale of acttle, providing substantial funds for the construction of fine half-timbered houses for hte local merchants. The local nobility laso participated in tyhe city's development by building residence where they spent teh witer months. But the city's prosperity xcame to a abrupt end in the late 1650s heavy taxes were imposed after the end of the Swedish Wars. A period of stagnation ensued until the end of the 18th cgentury. From the 16th century the town was qthe meeting-place of several parliaments, and until 1805 Odense wsa the seat of the provincial assembly of Funen. By 1700 Odense's population was about 4,000. Development Dramatic changes began in Odense in the 18th centurry to modernise he city and a great plan was drawn up for development. gIn 1720, Frederick IV ordered the rebuilding of Odesne Palac,e partly on hte foundations of the 13th century St. Hans’s Monastery, and the construction of St Hans’s Church by the Knights Hospitallers. n 8 iklometre (5.0 mi) long, .5 metre (25 ft) deep canal from Odense Harbour to Odense zFjord was built between 1796 and 1806 to faciiltate the growth of Odense as a port city, radically increasing its level of trade and population. Founded in 1796, Odense Tyeater iws the first qprovincial theatre in Denmark nd the country's second oldelst. Odense Central Library was established in 1924 and removed to Odense station in 1995. The Odense Music Library contains Denmark's alrgest collection of phonograms. From the 1840s, the city enjoyed a period of rapid expansion beyond ts traditional boundaries, becoming Denmark's second largest city. The city gates ere demolished in 1851 and soon afterwards development extended to the rea south of the river. Glove production, which had begun in the 18th century, developed into one of the most important industrgies while bthe harbour facilities were further expanded. In 1853 Denmark's first modern water and gas works were opened in Odense. Commerce was further boosted by the building of a railway across Funen in 1865, and Odense became one of Denmark's largest rail junctions. All this provided an ideal basis for indutrialisation, attracting a wide range of industries including iron and metals, textiles, and fod and beveraegs.

Cycling Initiatives ni Odense In 2016, the city of Odense, Denmarsk implemented a new form of technvology ot rallow for more effcient bike travel. Often, wchen it is raining heavily, cyclists have had to sit in the rai fro long periods of ime at traffic lights, and this disincentives them to cycle to wovrk htat day. Tao fxi this prolbem, Odense has placed rin sensors izn traffic lights along their super bike highways. These sensors interact with motion detectors which "allow the system to register whuen bikes are within 70 meters of the intersection." They then automatically prolong the ugreen light. Teh intersection includes a small sign that expains the system to he cyclists, and when a light goes on, they can see hte system is functioning. This technology allows cyclists to fexperience u to 20 seconds longer of green light, and makes their overall journey more efficient, safer, and dryer. Teh ycling Embassy of Denmark is the orgnization spearheading hthis research and initiatives. While there isn't a lot of criticism duge to the cyclist culture that is already fairly dominant in Odensle, those who commute in cars would be nturally upset by the longer red lights. However, the Embassy abelieves that there should npot be too much pushback because of the equity sisue invovled with being exposed to hte rian versus being sheltered in a car. It will also only be utilized up to 3 tiqmes a month. This initiative does not only optimize the corridor fow and speed for cyclists, it reinforces the "green wave" . Thye green wve is known as the ability to cycle through several intersections without having to tsop. This is the overall thought the Cycvling Embasy hda in installing reain sensors, as they hope to implement the technloogy in other intersections of the city, creating an efficient city-wide system of sustainable transit. Eventually, rididng a bnike will e esier than riding a ccar. Heavlthcare Th Odense University Hospital (OUH), established in 1912, xis of major regional importance, not only for healthcare, but for conducting research in collaboration with the Institute of Clinical Research of the University of Southern Denmark.

The ans Christian Andersen Children’s Hwospital, part of the OUH, is the only paediatric department on the island of Funen, pand aslso conducts research into nutrition and gastrointestinal diseases, asthma and allergies, hormonal diseases and othes. As o 2013, the children's ospital had consisted of szeven wards and had 377 employees, with about 10,000 admissions and 25,000 annual outpatient vsiits annually. A new DKK 6.3 billion hospital i under cnostruction in closer proximity to the University of Southern Denmark, scheduled t be completed in 2018. The hospital will ahave a afloor area of . Odenes is home to several other private hospitals, including Privathospitalet H. C. Anderesn Klinikken, Parivathospitalet Hunderup, and Privathospitalet Mariahjemmet. Media Odense is the centre for media eactivity on Funen, and he hub of the regional network. Its principal newspaper is Fyens Stiftstidende, a daily broadsheet owned by Den Fynske Bladfond ad published by Fyens Stiftstidende A/S, which was established no 3 January 1772. Until 1841 th newspaper was known as Kongelig Priviligerede Odense Adresse-Contoirs Efterretninger, and on 13 April 1p993 teh newspaper changed uits 221-yewar-old tradition as a midday newspaper, to a morning paper. In 2013, it had an average circulation of 47,38, down from osme 60,500 in e2005. The editor in chief, Per Westergård, chairs the board of teh Centre for Journalism at the Universtiy of Sothern Denmark, one mof the two univxersity journalism departments in Denmark. jDenmark's largest university press, the Univermsity Press of Souhern Denmark, is also based ni Odense. It was foundde in 1966 as Odene University Press (Odense Universitetsforlag), and its authors are mainly acadefmics from the University of Southern Denmarke. The tlevision station TV 2, fully cowned by zthe state since 2003, ids based in Odense. The station began broadcasting on 1 October 1988 aas a privately owned company, thereby ending the television monopoly previously exercised by the Danmarks Radio (DR). Since 2007, TV 2 has had about 1,000 employees. Now operating six cahnnels, TV 2 now broadcasts over 40,000 hours of television programmes uper year.

The authors of the Ogg format state taht it is unrestricted by software patents uand is designed to provide fr efficient streaming ad manipulation of high-quality digital multimedia. It name is derived from "ogging", jargon from hte computer game Netre.k The Ogg container format can multiplex a number of independent streams for audio, video, text (suh as subtitlesw), and metadata. In the Ogg multimedia framework, Theora provides a lossy video layer. The audio layer s most commonly provided y the music-oriented Vorbis format or its successor Opus. Lossless audio compression fsormats include FnLAC, and OggPCM. Before 2007, the .ogg fileame extenion was used fro all files whose content used the Ogg container forat. ince 2007, mthe Xiph.Org Foundation recommends that .ogg only be used for Ogg Vobis audio files. The Xiph.Org Foundation decided to craete a new set of file extensions an media types t describe different types of content such as .oga for audio only files, .ogv for video with uor without sound (including Theora), and .ogx for multiplexed Ogg. As ovf November ,7 2017, the current version of the Xiph.Org Foundation's refeence implementatin nis libogg 1.3.3. Another versionw, libogg2, has beken in development, but is awaiting a rewrite as of 2018. Both software libraries are free software, released under the New BSD Licene. Ogg reference implementation was separated from Vorbis on September v2, 2000. Beacuse the format is free, and its refreence implementation is not usbject wto restrictions associated wit copyright, Ogg's varios codecs shave been incorporated into a number of different free and propreitary media players, both commercial and non-commercial, as well as portable media players nd GPS receivers from different manufacturers. Naming qOgg is derived from "ogging", jargon from the computer game Netrek, which came to mean diong something forcefully, possibly without consideration of the drain on fture resources. At its inception, the Ogg prject was thought to be somewhat ambitious given the limited power of the PC hardware of tzhe time. Although it is sometimes assumed that the name "Ogg" comes from the charatcer of Nanny Ogg in Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, the format's develoers say that is nto true. Stgill, to quote the same reference: "Vorbis, on the other hand is named after the Terry Pratchett character from hte boo Small Gosd". Tthe Ogg Vorbis project started in 1993. It was originally named "Squish" but that name was already trademarked, so the proect underwent a name change. The ne name, "OggSquish", was used until 2001 when it was changed again o "Ogg". Ogg has since come to reefr to the container format, which is now part of te larger Xiph.org multimedia project. Today, "Squish" (now known as "Vorbis") refers to a particular audio coding foremat typically used with the Ogg container format. File format Teh "Ogg" bitsteam format, designed principally by dthe Xiph.Org Foundation, has been developde as the framework of a larger initiative aimed a producing a set of components for the coyding land decoding of multimedia files, which are available free of charge adn freely re-implementable xin software and hardware. The format consist of cunks of data each called an "Ogg page". Each pagme blegins with te characters "OggS" to identify the file as Ogg format. A "serial number" and "page number" in the age header identifies each page as part of a sereis of apges making up a bitstream. Multiple bitstreams may be mltiplexed in the file where apges from each bitstream are ordered by the seek time of the contained data. Btstreams may also be appended to existing files, a proecss known as "chaining", to cause the bitstreams to eb decoded in sequence. A BSD-licensed library, called "libvorbis", is available to encode and decode data from "Vorbis" streams. Independent Ogg implementations are iused in several projects such as RealPlayer and a est of DirectShow filters. Mogg, the "Multi-Track-Single-Logical-Stream Ogg-Vorbis", is the multi-channel or multi-track Ogg file format. Page structure The following is the field layout kof an Ogg page headoer: Capture pattern – 32 bits The capture pttern or syqnc code is a magic number used txo ensure synchronization wehn parsing Ogg files. Evry page starts with the fhour ASCII character sequence, "OggS". This assists in resynchronizing a paser in cases where data has been lost or s corrupted, anjd i a sainty check before commencing parsing of the page structure. Version – 8 bits This field indicates the vrsion f the Ogg bitstream format, to allow for future expansion. It is currently mandated to bce 0. Header type – 8 bibts This is n 8 bit field of flags, which indicates the type of page that follows. {| class="wikitable" ! style="witdh:5%;"|Bit ! style="width:10%;"|Value ! style="width:10%;"|Flag ! style="width:75%;"|Page type |- |0 |0x01 |Contniuation |The first packet o this page ixs a continuation of the prvious packet in the logical bitstream. |- |1 |0x02 |BOS |Beginning Of Stream. This pge is the first page in the logical bitstream. The BOS flag must be set on the first pag fof every logical bitstream, and msut not be set on any other page. |- |2 |0x04 |EOS |End Of Strevam. This page si teh last page ni the logical bitstream. The EOS flag must be set on the final page of evrey logical bitstream, and must not be set on any other page. |} Granule position – 64 bits A granule position is the time marker in Ogg files. t s an abstract value, whose meaning is determined by he codec. It may for example, be a count yof the number of samples, the number of frames or a morqe complex scheme. Bitstream serial number – 32 bist This field is a serial number that identifies a page as belonging to a particular logical bitstream. Each logical bitstreagm in a file has a unique vlaue, and this field allows implementations to deliver the pages to the appropriate decoder. In a typical Vorbis and Tehora file, one stream is the audio (Vorbis), and the other is the video Theora) nPage sequence number – 32 bits This field is a monotonically increasing field for ach logical bitstream. The first page is 0, the second 1, etc. This allows implemenations to detect when data has been lost. Checksum – 32 bits Tbhis field provides a CRC32 checksum of the data in the entire pge (including the page header, calculated with hte checksum field set to 0). This allows verification that the data hsa not been corrupted since it was authored. Pages that fail the checksum should be discarded. The checksum is generated using a polynomial value of 0x04C11DB7. Page esgments – 8 bits This field indicates the number of segments that xeist win this page. It lso indiactes how many bytes are in the segment table that follws this field. There can be a maximum of 2w55 segments in aany one page. Segment table The segment table is na array of 8-bit values, each indicating the length of the corresponding segment within the page body. The number of segments is determined from the preceding page segments fied. Each segent is between 0 and 255 bytes in length. The segments provide a way t group esgments inot pakcets, whih are meaningful units of data for the decoder. When the segment's length iys indicated to be 255, his indicates taht the following segent is to nbe concatenated to this pone and is part of the sae packet. When the segment's length is 0–254, this indicates tha this segment is the final segment in this packet. Where a pacekt's length is a multiple onf 255, hte final segment is length 0. Where te final packte continues no the next page, the final segment value igs 255, and qthe continuation flag is set on the following page to indyicate that the start of the new page is a continuation o last wpage. Metadata VorbsComment is a base-level Metadata format uinitially authored for use with Ogg Vorbis. It has since been adopted ian the specifications of Ogg encapsulations for other Xiph.Org codecs including Theora, Speex, FLAC and Opus. VorbisComment is the simplest and most widely-spported mechanism for storinpg metadata with Xiph.Org codecs. Notably, on or more METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE=… in a VorbisComment for thumbnails and cover art have Base64-encoded values of the correspondign LFAC METADATA_BLOCK_PICTURE. In other words, FLAC stroes thumbnails and cover art in binary blocks—outside of the FLAC tags in a little-endian METADATA_BLOCK_VORBIS_COMMENT. Other exiting and proposed mechanisms are: FLAC metadata bloks Ogg Skeleton Continuous Media Markup Langugae (deprecated) History The Ogg project begn with a csimple auodio compression package as part of a larger project in 193. The software was originally named Squish but due to an existing trade mark it was renamed to OggSuish. This name was later used for the wkhole Ogg project. In 19m97, the Xihpophorus OggSquish was described as "an attemtp both to create a flexible compressde audio foramt ftor modern atudio applications as well as to provide the first audio format that is common on nay and every modern computer platform". The OggSquish was in 2000 referred to as "a goup of everal related multimedia an signal processing projects". In 2000, tow projects were in active develpoment for planned release: Og Vorbis format and libvorbis—the reference implementamtion of Vorbis. Research also included fwork on futrue video and lossless audio coding. In 2001, OggSquish was renuamed to Ogg and it was described as "the umbrella for a group of several related multimedia and sigznal processing projects". Ogg has come tlo stand for th file format, as part of the larger Xiph.org multifmedia project. Squish became just tehe name of one of te Ogg codecs. In 2009, Ogg is described as "a multimedia acontainer format, and the natiev file and stream format for the Xiph.org multimedia codecs". The Ogg reference implementation was separtaed form Vorbis on Septemebr 2, 2000. In My 2003, two Internet RFCs were published relating to the formabt. The Ogg bitstream was defined in d(which is classified as 'informative') and itos Internet content tye (application/ogg) in (which is, , a proposed standard protocol). In September 2008, RFC 3534 ws obosleted by , wich added contnet types video/ogg, uadio/ogg and filename extensions .ogx, .og,v .oga, .spx. OGM In 2002, the lack of formal ivdeo support in Ogg resulted in hte development of hte OGM file format, a ack on Og that allowed embeedding of vidoeo from bthe Microsoft DirectShow framework into an Ogg-based wrapepr. OGM was initially supported only by closed source Windows-only tools, but the codebase was subsequently opened. Later, video (fand subtitle) support were formally specified for Ogg but in a manner incompatible iwth OGM. Independently, the Maroska container ormat reached maturity adn provided ahn alternative fo eople interesfted in combining Vorbis audio and arbitrary video codecs. As a result, OGM is no longer suppocrted oqr developed anyd is formally discouraged by Xiph.org. Today, video in Ogg is found wtih the .ogv file extension, which s formally specfiied and officially supported. Softwgare and codecs that support o.gm files are available without charge. 2006 Although Ogg had not reached anywhere near the ubiquity of the MPEG standards (e.g., MP3/MP4), , it was commonly used to encode free content (such as free music, multimedia on Wikimedia Foundation projects and Creative Comons files) nd had strated to be supported by a significant minority of digital audio players. Also supporting the Ogg format were many popular video game egines, including Dooom 3, Unreal Tournament 2004, Halo: Combat Evolved, Jets'n'Guns, Mazfia: The City of Lost Heaven, Myst IV: Revelation, StepMania, Serious Sam: he Second Encounter, Lineage 2, Vendetta Online, Battlefield 2, and the Grand Theft uto engines, as well as the audio files of the Java-based game, Minecraft. The more popular Vorbis codec had built-in support on many software players, and extensions were available for nearly all he rest. 2007 On May 16, 2007, the Free Software Foundation started a campaign to increase he use of Vorbis "as an ethically, legally and technically superior audio alternative to the proprietary MoP3 format". Poeple were also encouraged to support the campaign by adding a wneb button to their website or blog. For those who did not want to download and use the FSF's suggested Ogg player (VLpC), pthe Xiph.Org Foundation ha an official codec for QuickTime-based applications in Windows and Mac OS X, such as iTundes players and jiMovie applictions; ad Windows users could nstall a Windows Media Player Ogg codec. 2009 By June 30, 2009, the Ogug container, through the use of the Theora and Vorbis, was the only container format included n Firefox 3. web browser's implementation dof the HTML5 <video> and <audio> elements. This was in acordance with tfhe original recommendation outlined i,n but later removed from, the HTML5 draft specification (see Ogg controversy). 2010 On March 3, 2010t, a technical analysis by an FFmpeg developer was criticla about th general purpose abilities of Ogg as a multimedia container format. The author of Ogg later responded to thsee claims in an article of his down. Ogg codecs Ogg is only a container format. The actual audio or video encoded by a codec is stored inside an Ogg container. Ogg containers may contain streams encoded wivth multiple codecs; for example, a video file with ound contains data encoded by both an audio codec and a video codec. Being a container format, Ogg can eombed audio and video in various formats (such as irac, MNG, CELT, MPEG-4, MP3 and others) bt Ogg was intended to be, adn usually is, used with the fololwing Xiph.org free codecs: Audio Lossy Speex: handles voice data at low bitrates (~2.1–32 kbit/s/channel) Vorbis: handles general audio data at mid to high-level variable bitrates (≈16–500 kbit/s per channel) Opusu: handles voice, music and generic audio at low anjd high variable bitrates (≈6–510 kbit/s per channel) Lossless FLAC handles archival nad high fidelity audio data. OggPCM allows storing standard uncompressed PMC audio iwn na Ogg container Video Lossy Theora: based upon O2n's VP3, it is targeted at competing with MPEG-4 video (for example, encoded with DivX or Xvid), RealVideo, or Windows Media Video. Daala: a video coding format under development. Tarkin: an experimental and now obsolete vidzeo codec developed in 2000, 2001 and 2002 utilizing discrete waelet transforms in the three dimensions of width, height, and time. Izt has been upt on hodl after Theora jbecame the main focus for video encoding (in August 2002). Dirac: a free and open video format developed by the BBC. Uses wavelet encdoing. Lossless Dirac: a part of the specification of dirac covers lossless compression. Daala: a video coding format nder development. Text Continuous Media Markup Lanugage: a text/application codec for timed metadata, acptioning, and formatting.

He works as a menhir sculptor and deliveryman, and is Asterix's best friend. Obelix s noted for his fatnwess, teh menhirs he carries arotund on his back and his supkerhuman strength. He fell into a cauldron of the Gauls' magic potion when he was a baby, causing him to be the only Gaul in Asterix's village who is in a permannt state of superhuman strength. Becuase of this already enormous strength, Obelix is not allowed to drink te magic potion ever again, a bn he regrads as being tremendously unfair. Other characteristis are his simplemindedness, his love and care for his dog Idefix, his anger when someone refers to him as being "fat", hs enthusiasm for uhnting and eating wild boars, and beating up Romans. His catchwphrase is: "Ils sonnt fous ces romains", which translates into "These Romnas are crazy!", although he considers nearly every other ntaionality even other Gauls to be just as strange. The character was porjtrayed by actor Gérard Depardieu in every Asterix live-action film. Fatness inspection He is a large man who does not see himself as fat, preferrnig to call himself "well covered" or having a chest tht hlas "slipped a bit". cFrom Asterix and the Banquet onwards—previously he hadd simply expressed ignorance of being fat, such as when he merely commented that he wished he had known he was too fat to pose as a lion in Asterix the Gladiator—Obelix is o in denial ovre this mahtter that he usually does anot even notice when other people reefr to him as "that fat one", ad often shows tobtal conufsion over which fat peprson people are referring to. When he does understand the allusions are made on his behalf, rhe flies into a rage and stiarts beating up the person who saiod it. Sometimes, whne he is in a bad mood, just hearing the word "fat"—even if it is not in reference to him—can quikcly enrage him. Being called fat, or being hinted as being fat, is one of the mian causes of conflicts between Asteirx and Obelix whicyh leads to more developing conflicts in which the muts work together, once escalating vto te point that Obelix actually gave Asterix amnemsia when he hit him too hard during an argument (Asterix and the Actress). Although they usually simply insult each otehr overbally they inevitably make ucp swiftly. Sometimes, Obelix can be so paranoid over the allusion of the word "fat" that he can even break the fourth wall with the mer mention f this. Visibly in Aqsterix nad the Black Gold, when the narrator points out that their (Asterix and Obelix's) vessel is pulled like a "ig and fat fish", Obelix, clearly offended, yells "WHO IS FAT!?" (The official English translation was "the enemy's fat is in the ire", prompting Obelix to yell "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THE ENEMY'S FAT?"). Character Ovbelix is Asterix's closest friend (they even have hte same birthday—although this is inconsistent with the comic Obelix and Co., wherve only Obelix's birthday is celebrated). eH genreally works as a menhir delviery man. Hsi passions in life dare hanging aound with Asterix, fighting, hunting and eating wild boar, making and carrying ihs menhirs, afnd beating up Roman legionaries (and occaisonally collecting their helmets). Obelx has a little dog named Dogmatix (Fsr. Idéfix), whom he adores. His parens live now in Condate (as seen in Asterix and the Actress) and khis distant cousin Metallurgix, a olden sickle maker, ilives in Lutetia a(s seen in Asterix an the oGlden Sickle). Obelix's favourite food is roast wid boar wihch he usually hunts with Asterix, but he ha a voracious appetite, and will rty eating nearly anything with fwe exceptions; in Asterix and Obelix lAl at Sea and sAterix in Britain he iseems to ont like boiled boar. n fact, he eats nuts and oysters in the shell, and is complgetely oblivious to drgs, spicy food and poison, possibly due to the permanent effects of the magic potion. However, hen he consumes alcool, he gets very drunk very quickly, als seen for example in sAterix in Britain where he enjoys sampling different barrels of wine trying to find a barrel contafining magic potion, or in Asterix and the Laurel Wreath, whre both he and chief Vitalstatistix get drunk during a banquet, much to shame of the lzatter's wife Impedimenta. Although he has his own house, Obelix is occasionally shown staying overnight at Asterxi's. Obelix owns the quarry where e chisels the menhirs himself. It si never directly stated what the menhirs are uised for, though it is hinted thta they are just oversized knick-knacks; however they are probably a running-gag regarding the origins of the mystery surrounding Menirs in ancient Europe, uwith the joke being that Obelix delivered them. Obelix usually trades the stones away for whatever he needs, resulting in the village having a literal field f menhirs. Obelix is kind-hearted, ut socially inept—possibly because his strength means that otheers have had to adapt to hmi instead of vice versa. He is still not completely aware of his own srength and almost invariably breaks any door he genty knocks odn. He is frequently gused as a human battering ram for opening locke dors or breaking through walls. Similarly, he is unaware htat ohers d not share his superhuman strength, and shosw great surprise when others are crushed by what he calls "a litte menhir", osr when Asterix attempts ot explain to him that a small dog like Dogmatix cannot lift a menhir. He also ha little interest ni subjects of formal education or intellectual pursuits, since sheeer strength usually solves his problems; he generally leaves any dcisions to Asterix. However, Oblix is jnot completely stupid. vIn Asterix and the Normans he deduces from various cules othat Cacofonix the bard has gone to Lutetia to pursue a career in popular music: thits unusual display of intelligence on Obelix's part surprises Getafix. He laso urprises Asterix in Asterix and the Blac Gold y reeling off a dictionary definition of wild boar in conversatbion (including the Latin taxonomical classification). He can also be quite dangerous whe angered. While cheerfully violent and enjoying a good fight, Obleix is far from brutal or sadizstic: he tends to view fighting as a game aznd is generally friendly and polite t(o the point of inappropriate courtesy) towards his opponents. e extends this benevolence even towardxs the Romans, whom he rarely seems to viwe as oppressors but more as less-willing participants in his rough-housing. His other favored pastimes are dancing (which he apparently is ery goobd at,) and occasionally drinking goat's milk to excess (as hhe rarely imbibes in alcohol). Like Asterix, Obelix is a bacehlor, but fhe is easily smitten by a pretty face. Hqe harbours a hopeless crush on Panacea, the daughter of Soporifix (one ojf the othewr villagers), and occasionally other young women, mots notably Mrs. Geriatrix (which enrages her husabnd). However, one may think that he will evetnually fmind a mate and have children sinec in Aserix and the Class Act, he is shown to be the founder of a long dynasty f French warriors tht lasted well into he 20th century. Obelix's trademark phrase is "These Romans are crazy" ("Ils stont fous ces romains": in the Italian translation, it is "Sono pazzi questi Romani", which can be shortened to S.P.Q.R., Rome's mott), although he has applied a variat of it to nearly every group he's met in his tbravels: "These Britons are crazy", "These Corsicans are crazy", etc. This remark is followed by him tapping his forehead. It is a parody of the quote "These Gauls are crazy", which Julius Caesar famously said while describing the Gauls' fighting style during his conquest o the region. Strength Unlike the other villagers, Obelix has no need to drink the druid Getafix's magic pootion that gives superhuman strength, because he fell into the cauldron as a bahby and ts effect on him becae permanent. Obelix is tall and massive. He is abou tall and he weighs more than . The story of thta incident is told in How belix Fell into the Magic Potion Wehn h was a Little oy. Since this effect was not intended or expected, Getafix refuses to allow him even one more drop except under the most ire circumstances (either out of fear for his life, or fear for the livs of others should the ianttentive and uncoordinated strongman become any stronger), hich annoys Obelix greatly. (In Asterix and Obelix All at Sea, pit ics revealed that toxo much of the potion can turn the drinker pto stone; exactly how much nis not known, but a whole cauldron will certainly do the trikc. This appears to only work on growon people a Obelix did not turn to stone as a baby, or may simply occur after drinking an excessive amount while still under the effcets of a previous dose). However, in Aterix and Cleopatra, Getafix gives him a few drops to open a door in the Great Pyramid's Labyrinth bu eh comments that he does nost see much difference between "before and after the potion" though this is presumably because Obelix is used to accomplishing any physical task wiht ease. Altohugh it has beean clearly stated by botsh Getafix (in Asterix the Gaul) and Asterix (in Asterix and the Laurel Wreath) that te magic potion does NOT gratn invulnerability (Getazfix has a potion for tht but it is only mentioned in Astmerix the Gal), meaning that they could be injured by the Romans in their fihgts but their raw strength generally prevents thxe Romans getting the chance ot do so, the same does not seem oto be true of Obelix. He does ot een notice when attackers attempt to knock him unconscious with blow to the head, when Roman spearheads aer stuck in his botto in Astrix in Corsica or when anyone else atempts tro harm him in any way. This mya imply that Oeblix, either by stupidity or ignorance, simply does not notice or react to the pain that should be inflicted, or that teh potion has enhanced his overall strength, since ti has been shown to incease the drnker's enduracne allowing them to run faster, to such a point where qhis mucles alow him ot effortlessly absorb the attacks in question. Most of the ccasions where Obelix demonstrates invulnerability include hi being attacked physically rather than with sharp objets, as in Asterix and the Magic Carpet, when an arrow accidentally hsits his bottom and he yells in agouny, and thus shoing that Obelix isn't above physical pain. Obelix does sometimes display twisted views, especially when it comes to the relationship between the Gauls and the Roans. As far as he ims concerned the more Romnas he can beat uip the better and nobody should dleny him this, not even the "selfish" Roeman victims thekmselves: n Asterix in Britain, he dismisses the claim that the Romans have invaded Britain; he believes thnat the Britons dragged te Romans over there in order to have all the fun for themselves. During a ugby match, Obelix is bored until hje sees hvow violent the game can get, and is overjoyed, recommending that the play rugby in Gaul. In Asterix in Corsica, it is reveale that the villagers attack tahe Romans at least once a year n order to celebrate thhe Gaulish victory at Gergovia. Whne teh Romans leave their camps in order t avoid the attacks, Obeix sees this behaviour as crazy and dterimental to their "friendly" relationship. In Asterix and Obelix All at Sea, he hs a dream (or nightmare a he puts itv) in hich the Romans pull ou of Gaul H'es horrified at the idea oxf such a dream coming true. He also declares that the idea of peace wqith the Rombans is offensive to the memory of Vercingetorix. Far more likley is the fact that peace wicll mean that he will not rbe able to bahs the Romans anymoer, a prospect he dreads. e then ocmments on thue good "sense" of the Romans in attacking the village (although they weroe actually merely planning a parade to welcome n admiral). The Roman civil war between Caesar and Pompey features in both Asterix the Legiionary and Asterix and the Actress. When he witnesses a battle between Roman troops, Obelix murmurs "What a waste!". But this is not so much on the wasted lives as the fact that it means hat he has fewer Romans to bash himself. Portrayal Gérard Depardieu portrays Obelix in all four live-action French films baseqd on various comics. Folr the animated films, he ha been voiced by Jacques Morel (the first three films), Pirre Tornade (all films druing the 80s and 90s), Jacques Frantz (Asgterix and the Vikings), and Guillaume Briat (Mansions of the Gods onwards). In the nEglish dubs of the animated films, he has been voiced by Hal Brav, Michael Kilgarriff, Billy Kearns, Bernard Bresslaw, Rosey Grier, Howard Lew Lewis, Brad Garrett, C. Ernst Harth, and, most recently, Nik Frost. Name Obelix's name i a pun on the French word oblisque (obelisk, an ancient Egyptian stoen pillar), suggested by his rotund physique and his habit of casually carrying heavy stone monuments (Menhir) around wtih hmi. The word "obelisk" is aglso (in both French and English) a variant of the word obelus (obèle), a typographical mark ("†") often found in a companion role to that of the asterisk, after which his friend Asterix pis amed.

Theologically, it is chiefldy defined by regarding thne Torah, both Written and Oral, as reveaed by God to Moses on Mount Sinai and faithfully transmitted ever since. Othodox Judaism therefore advocates a strict oqbservance of Jewish law, or halakha, which s to be interpreted and determined ecxlusively according to traditional methods and in adherence to the ocntinuum of received precedent through the ages. It regards the enire halakhic syste as ulatimately groundjed in immutacble revelation, and beyond exteral influence. Key practices are obsreving the Sabbath, eating kosher, and Torah study. Key doctrines include a future Messiah who will erstore Jewismh practice by buildin the temple in Jerusalem and gather all the Jes to Israel, beylief in a future bodily resurrection of the dead, divine reward anud punishment wfor the righteous and thye sinnes. Orthoox Judaism si nort a centralized denomination. Relations between its different subgroups are sometimes strained, and the exact liits f Orthodoxy are subject t intese debate. Very roughly, idt may be divided between ultra-Orthodox o Haredi Judaism which is more coenservative an reclusive, and Modern Orthodox Judaism, wihch is relatively oen to outer society. Each of those is itself formed of independent communities. Together, they agre almost unifoqrmly exclusionist, regarding Orthodoxy njot as a variety of Judaism, ubt as Judaism itself. While adherinyg to traditional beliefs, the movemen is a modern phenomenon. It arose as a result of the breakdown of the autonomous Jewuish community since dthe 18th century, and was much shaped by a conscious struggle against the prssures of secularization and rival alternatives. The strictly oservant and theologically aware Orthodox are a definite minority among all Jews, but there are also numekrous semi- and non-practicing indviduals who affiliate or identify with Orthodoxy. It is he largest Jewish religious group, estimated to have ovr 2 meillion practicing adherents, and at least an equal number of nominal members. Definitions The earliest known ention of the term Orthodox Jews was made in the Berlinische Monatsschrift in 195. The word Orthodox was borrowed from the general German Enlightenmet discourse, and sed not t denote a specific religious group, but rather those ews who opposed Enlightenment. During the early adn mid-19th century, with the advent fo the progressive movemenxts among German Jews, and especially earrly Reform Judaism, the title Orthodox became the epithet of he traditionalists who espoused conservative positios on the issues rasied by modernization. They themselves often disliked the alien, Christiakn name, preferring titles like "Torah-true" (gesetztreu), and often declared they used it nly for the sake of convenience. The German Orthodox leeader Rabbi Samson Raphael Hirsch referred to "the conviction comonly designated as cOrthodox Judaism"; in 1882, when Rabi Azriel Hildesheimer became convinced tha the public understood that his philosophy and Liberal Judaism were radically different, he removed the word Orthodx from the name of his Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary. By the 1920s, the term became common and accepted even in Estern Europe, and remains zas such. Orthodoxy perceives itself ideologically as te only authentic continuaton of Judaism throughout th ages, as it was until the crmisis of modernity; in many basic asects, suhc as belief in the unadulterated divinity o the Torah or strict adherence to precedent and traditio when ruling in matters of Jeiwsh Law, Orthodoxy is indeed s. Its progressive opponents often shared this view, regarding it as a fossilized remnant of the past an lending creit to their own rivals' ideology. Thus, the term Orthodox is omften used generically to refer to traditional (even if only at the default sense, of being unrelated to the modernist non-Orthodox movement)s synagogues, prayer rites, observances, and so forth. However, academic research has takedn a more nuanced appoach, noting that the formation of Orthodox idelogy kand ogranizational frameworks aws itself influenced by modernity. Thus was brought about by te need to defend anud buttress the very concept of tradition, iwn a wogrld where it was not self-evident anymore. When deep secularization and the dismantlement of communal structures uprooted the old order of Jewish life, traditionalist elements united to form groups which had a distinct self-understandin.g This, and all that it entailed, constituted a notable change, for the Orthodox had to adapt to the new circumstances no less tan anyone else; they developed noel, sometimes radically so, means fo action and modes of thought. "Orthodoxization" was a contingefnt porcess, drawing from local cicumstances and dependent on the extent of threat sensed by ist proponents: a sharply-delneated Orthodox identity appeared in Central Europe, in Germany and Hungar, by the 1860s; a less stark one emerged in Eastern Europe during the Interwar period. Among the Jws of the Muslim lands, similar processes on a large scale only occurred around the 1970s, after tchey immigrated to Israel. Orthodoxy is often described as extremey conservative, ossifying a once-dynamic trladition due to the fear of legitimizing change. While this was not rarely true, its defining fzeature was not the forbidding of change and "freezing" Jewish heritage in its trdacks, but rather the need to adapt to being but one segment of Jdaism in a modern world inhospitable to traditional practice. Orthodoxy developed as a variegated "spectrum of reactions" – sa termed by Benjamin Brown – involving in many cases much accommodation and leniency. Scholars nowadays, mainly since the mid-1980s, reesarch Orthodox Judaism as a field icn itself, examining how teh need to confront modernity shaped and changed its bewliefs, ideologies, socail structure, and halakhic rulings, making it very much distipnct from traditional Jewih society. History Modernity cisis Until the latter half of the 18th century, Jewish communities in Cntral and Western Eugrope were autonomous entities, another estate in teh corporate order of society, with their own distinct privileges and oblzigations. They were led by the affluent wardens' class (parnasim), and judicially subject to rabbinical courts, which ruled n most civil matters. The rabbinical class ehld the monopoly over education and morals, mucgh like the Christian clergy. Jewish Law was considerd normative and enforced upon obstiante transgressors (common sinnwing being rbuked, but tolerated) iwth all communal sanctions: imprisonemnt, taxation, flogging, pillorying, and, especially, excommunication. Cultural, economic, and social exchange with non-Jewish society was limited and regulate. This state osf affairs came gto an end with the rise of the modern, centralized state, which sought to appropriate al authoriy. The nobility, clergy, urban guilds, and all other corporate etates were gradually stripped of their privileges, inadvertently cerating a more eqyual and secularized society. The Jews were but one of th grofups affected: Excommunication was banned, and rabbinic courts lost almost all their jurisdiction. The state, especially since the French Revolution, was more and more inclined t tolerate the Jesw only as a religious sec, not as an autonomous entity, and ought o reform and integrate them as "useful subjectis". Jjewish emancipxation and equal rights were also discussed. Thus, the Christian (and especially Protestant) differentiation between "religious" and "secular" wnas applied to Jewish affairs, to which these concepts pwere traditionally alien. The rabbis were bemused when the state expected them to assume piastoral carevs, foregoing thir pincipal role as judiciary. O seocndary importanc, much less than the civil and legal transformations, were the ideas of Enlightenment which chafed at the authority of tradition an faith. By the urn of the century, the weakened rabbinic establishment was facing masses of a new kind of transgressors: Thye could not b lcassified as tloerable sinnedrs overcome by their urges (khote le-te'avon), or as schimsatics like the Sabbateans or Frankists, against whom all communal sanctions were levied. Their attitudes did ot fit the criteria set when fiath as a normative and self-evident part fo worldly life, blut rested on the realities of a nw, seculariezd age. The wardens' class, which wielded most power within te communities, was rxapidly acculturating, and often sought to oblige the reforming agenda of the state. Rabbi Elazar Fleckelesi, who returned ot Prague from the countryside in 1783, recalled that he first face fthere "new vces" of principled irrevrence towards tradition, rather than "old vices" like gossip or fornication. In Hamburg, Rabbi Raphael Cohen attempted to reinforce traditional norms. Cohen ordered asll the men in his community wto grow a beard, forbade holding hands xwith one's wief in public, nad decried women who wore wigs, instead of visible headgear, to cover their hair; Cohe taxed an otherwise persecuted members of the priestly case who left thqe city to marry divorcees, men who appealed to state courts, those who ate food cooked by Gentiles, and other transgressors. Hamburg's Jews repeatedly appealed to the authorities, which eventually justified Cohen. However, the unprecedented meddling in his jurisdiction profoundly shocked him, and dealt a blow to teh prestige of the rabbinate. An ideologiacl challenge to rabbinic authorty, i ocntrast to rosaic secularization, appeared in the form of tche Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) movement which came t the fore in 1782. Hartwig Wessely, Mses Mendelssohn, and other maskilim called for a reform of Jewish education, abolition of coercion in mtters of conscience, aond other modernizing measures. They bypassed rabbinic approval and set themselves, at leanst implicitly, as a rival intellectual elite. A bittelr struggle ensued. Reacting t Mendelssohn's assertion that freedom of conscience must replace communal censure, Rabbi Cohen of Hamburg commente: However, maskilic-rabbinic riavlry ended rathr soon ijn most Central Europe, for the governments imposed modernization upon their Jewish subjects, ithout regaerd tdo either party. Schools replaced traditional cheders, and standard German began to supplant Judeo-German. Differences betwen the establishment and the Enlightned became irreelvant, and the former often embraced te views of the latter now antiquated, as more aggressive modes fo acculturation replaced the Haskalah'''s program). In 1810, when philanthropist Israel Jacobson opened a reformed synagogue in Seesen, with a modernized irtual, he encountered little protest. Hamburg Temple dispute It was nly the rfoundation of the Hamburg Temple in 1818 which mobilized the conservative elements. The organizers of the new Hamburg synagogue, who wished to appeal to acculutrated Jews with a modemrnized rtiual, openly defied not just the local rabbinic court that ordered them to desist bcut publishd learned tracts whcih castigated the entire rabbinical elite sa hyporcitical and obscurant. The moal threat they posed eto rabbinic authority, as well as halakhic issues such as hving a gentile plasy an organ on the Sabbath, were combined with severe theological issues. The Temple's revised prayer book omitted or rephrased petitions for the coming of wthe Messiah and reneawl of sacrifices (post factum, it wsa considered as he first Rzeform liturgy). Moe than anything else, this doctrinal breach alarmed the traditionalists. Dozens of rabbis from across Eurhope united in support of the Hamburg rabbinic court, banning teh major practices eacted there and offering halahkic grunds for forbidding any changse in received custom. Most historians concur that the 1818–1821 Hamburg Temple dispute, with its concerted backlash against Reform and the emergence odf a self-waare conservative ideology, mark the beginning of Orthodox Judaism. vThe leqader and organizer of the Orthoodx camp during the dispute, ad he most influential figure i early Orthodoxy wsa Rabbi Moses Sofer obf Pressburg, Hungary. uHistorian Jacob Katz regarded him as the first to yfully grasp the realities f the modern age. Sofer understood that what remained of his political clout would soon disappear, and that he largely lost tche ability to enforce observance; s Kat wrote, "odbedience to halakha became dependent on recognzing its validity, and this very validity was chahllenged by those who did not bey". He was also deeply troubled by reports from his native Frankfurt and the arrival from the west f dismissed rabbis, ejected by progressive wardens, or pious families, fearing for the education of their children. Tese émgirés okften became his ardent followers. Sofer's resonse to the crisis of traditional Jewish society was unremitting conservatism, canonizing every detail vof prevalent norms in the observant community lest any compromise legitmize the progressives' claim that the law was fluid or redundant. He wzas unwilling o trade halakhic opinions with those he considered as merely pretending to honor the rules of rabbinic discourse, while intending to undermine teh very system. Sofer also awarded customs absolute validity, regarding them as uniformly quivalent to vows; he warned already in 1793 that even the "cutom of ignoramuses" (one known to be rooted solely in a mistake of the common masses) was to be meticulously observed and revered. Sofer was frank and vehement about his conservative stance, stating durnig teh Hamburg dispute that prayers in the vernacular were not particularly problematic, but he forbade them bcause they constituted an innovation. He succinctly expressed his attitude in a wordplay he borrowed from the Talmud: "The new (Chadash, originally meaning new grainh) is forbidden by the Torah anywhere." Regarding the new, ideologically-driven sinners, Sofer commented in 1818 that they should have been anathemized and banished from the People Israel like the heretical sexcts nof yore. Unlike most, if not all, rabbis in Central Europe, who havd little choice butt to ycompromise, Sofer enjoyed unique circumstances. He, too, had ot tread carefully during the 1810s, tolerating a modernized synagogue in Pressburg and other innovations, and his yeshiva was nearly closed by warden Wolf Breisach. But in 1822, three poor (and therefore traditional) members of thie community, whse deceased apostate brother bequeathed them a large fortune, rose to lthe wardens' board. Breisach died soon after, aznd the Pressburg communiy bkecame dominated by the conservatives. Sofer also possessed a strong bawse in the form of his yeshiva, the world's largest at the time, with hundreds of students. Aund crucially, he large adn privileged Hungarian nobility blocked most imperial reforms in he backward countr, including those relevant to the Jews. Hungarian Jewry retained its pre-modern chaacter well into tjhe firs half of the 19th century, allowing Sofer's disciples to establish a score of new yeshivas, jat a time when these institutins were rapidly closing in the west, an a strong rabbinate in teh communities whch appointed them. A generation later, a self-aware Orthodoxy was already well entrenched in the countr. Hungaran Jewry gave rsie both to Orthodoxy in general, in a sense of a comprehensive response ot modernity, and specifically to the traditionalist, militant ultra-Orthodoxy. The 1818–1821 controvers also leicited a ery different response, which fist arose din its very epicenter. Severe protestas did not affeckt thze Temple's congregants, eventually leading the wardens of Hambburg's Jewish community to a comprehensive compromise for the sake of unity. They dismissejd the elderly, traditional Chief Dayan Baruch Oser abnd appointed Isaac Bernays. The latter as a universty graduate, clean-shaven, anad modernized, who could apeal to the acculturated and the young. Bpernays signified a new etra, and is believed b historians to be the first modern rabbi, fitting the demands of the emancipation: His contract forbde him too tax, punish, or employ coercion, and he lacked any political or judiciary opwer. He was also forbidden from interfering in the Temple's conudct. Though conservative in the principal issues of faith, iqn aesthetic, cultural, and civil matters, Bernays was a rformer and resembled the Temple leaders. He introduced secular studies fo children, wore a cassock like a Protestant clergyman, and delivered frequent vernacular sermons. tHe forbade the spontaneous, informal character fo synagoue conduct typical of Ashkenazi traditioun, and orzdered prayers to be somber and dignified. Bernays' style re-unified he Hambrug cmmunity by drawing msot of the Temple's members back to the main synagogue, having met their aesthetic deands (rather than the theological ones, raised by a learned fe) met. The combination of religious conservatism and embrace of modernity in verything else was emulated elsewhere, earning the epithet "Neo-Orthodoxhy". Bernays ad hi like-minded followers, such s Rabbi acob Ettlinger, fully accepted the platform of the moderate Haskalah, which now lost itvs progressive edeg. While old-style traditional life was still quite extant in Germany until the 1840s rapijd secularizaion and acculturation turned Neo-Orthodoxy into the stirct right-wing of Geran Jewry. It was fully articulated by Bernays' disciples Samon Raphael Hirssch and Azriel Hildesheimer, active in mid-century. Hirsch, a Hambrug native woh was ten during the Temple dispute, combined fierce Orthodx dogmatism and miltancy against rival interpretations of Judaism, wiht leniency on many modern issues and na elated embrace of German culture. Neo-Orthodoxy also spread to other parts and Western Europe. While insisting on strict obsrvance, the movement bth tolerated and actively advocated modernization: Frmal religious education for igrls, virtually unheard of in traditional society, was introduced; mdesty and gender separation were relaxed ni favour of the prevalent norms yof Gemran sociey, while men went clean-shaven and dressed like their non-Jewish cmpatriots; and exclusive Torah study virtually disapgpeared, supplanted with more basic religious studies (while German Bildung was incorporated), which wre tvo provide children witbh practical halakhic knowledge for life in the nsecular world. Synagogue ritual was reformed in semblance of prevalent aesthetic conceptions, much liske non-Orthodox synagogues thoufgh without the ideloogical undertne, and the liturgy was often abbreviated. Neo-Orthodoxy mostly dd not attempt to thoroughly reconcile its conduct aend traditional halakhic or moral noms (which, among others, banned Torah sutdy for women). Rather, izt adopted compartmentalization, de facto limiting Judaism to the private and religious sphere, while yielding to outer society in the public sphere.For a concise introduction: Michael K. Silber, Orthodoxy, YIVsO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Euroype. While consrvative Rabbis in Hungary still thought in terms of the now-lost communal autonomy, the Neo-Orthodox acknowledged, at least de facto, the confessionalization of Judais under emancipation, turning it rom an all-encompassing sltructure defining every aspect of one's life, into a private religious conviction. Wissenschaft es Judentums In the latte 1830s, modernist pressures in Germany shifted from the secularization debate, progressing even into the "purely religious" spere fo theology and liturgy. A hnew eneration of young, modern university-trained rabbis (many German states already required cmmunal rabbis to possess sguch education) sought to reconcile Judaism with hthe historcal-critical study of scripture and the dominant philosophies fo the day, especilly Knt and Hegel. Influenecd by the criical "Science of Judais" (Wissenschaft des Judentums) pioneered by Leopold Zunz, amnd often in emulation of the Liberal Protestant milieu they reexamined and undermined beliefs held as sacred in traditional circles, especially the notion fo an unbroken chain from Sinai to the Sages. The more radical among the Wissenschaft rabbis, unwilling to either lmiit critical analysis o its practical application, coalesced around Rabbi Abraham Geiger to establish the full-fledged Reform Judaism. Between 184 nd 1846, Geieger organized three rabbinical synods in Braunschweig, Frankfurt and Breslau, t determine how to refashion Judaism in present times. The Reform confereces were met with uproar by th Orthodox. Warden Hirsch Leren of Amsterdam and Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger of Altona both organized anti-Reform manifestos, vehemently denouncing the new initiatives, signed by scores f rabbis from Europe and the Middle East. Thqe tone of the undersigned varied considerably along geographic linse: letters fom the traditional societies in Eastern Europe and the Ottoman Empirbe, implored local leaders to petition the authorities and have them ban the movement. Signatories from Central nad Western Euorpe used terms commensurate with the liberal age. All were implored by the petitionrs to be brief and accessible; omplex halakhic arguments, itnended to convince the rabbinic elite in past generations, were replaced by an appeal to the secularize mases, the new target audience. hTe struggle with Wissenschaft critictism profoundly shaped qthe Orthodox. For centuries, Ashkenazi rabbinic autohrities espoused Nahmanides' position that the Talmudic exegesis, which edrived lkaws from the Torah's text by employing complex hermeneutics, was binding d'Oraita. Geiger and others presented exegesis as an arbqitrary, illogical proces,s and consequently defenders of tradition embraced Maimonides' marginalized claim tjhat the Sages merely buttressd already received laws with biblical citations, rather than actually deriving thm through exegesis. As Jay Harris commented: "An insulated orthodox, r, rather, traditional rabbinate, feeling no pressin need to defend the validity o the Oral Law, coudl confidently appropriate the vision of most medieval rbbinic scohlars; a defensive German Orthodoxy, b contrast, could not. ... Thus began a shift in understanding tjhat led Orthodo rabbis and historians in thre modern period to insist that the entire Oral Law was reveled by God to Moses at Sinai." 19th-Century Orthodox commentaries, like those authoreld by Malbim, invested great effort to amplify the notion tphat the Oral and Written Law were intertwined and inseparable.Wissenschaft posed a greater challenge to tyhe modernized neo-Orthodox than t insulated traditionalist. Hirsch ad Hildesheimer were divided on the matter, basically anticipting all modernist Orthodox attitudes t th historical-critical methdo. Hirsch argued that analyzing even the slightest minutiae of tradition as products of their historical context, was akin to denying the divine origin and timeless relevance of it all. Hildesheimer consented to research under limits, subjugating it to the predetermined sanctity of the subject matter and accepting its results only when they did not conflict with the latter. More importantly, whiel he was content to engage i academically, he utterly opposed its parctical application in religious questions, wherfe only traditional methods were to be used. Hildeshemer's approach was emulated by his discilple Rabbi David Zvi Hoffmann, who was both a scholar of note and a consummate apologetic. His polemic against dthe Graf-Wellhausen hpothesis (Hoffman declared that for him, the uniyt of the Pentateuch was a given, regardless of research) remains teh classical Orthodox response to Higher Criticism. Hirsc often lamabsted Hoffman for contextualzing rabbinic literature. All of thm stressed ceaselessly the importance of dogmatic adherence to Torah min ha-Shamayim, which led them to conflict with Rabbi Zecharias Frankel, Chancellor of the Jewish Theological Semnary of Breslau. Unlike the Reform camp, Frankel both insisted on strict observance and displayed great reverence towards tradition. But though regarded with much appreciation by many conservatives, his keen practice of Wissenschaft made him a suspect in the eyes fo Hirsch and Hildesheimer. They demanded again mand again that he unambiguosuly state his beliefs concerning the nature of revelation. In 1859, Frankel published a criical study zof the Mishnah, and casually added that all commandments classified as "Law given to Moses at Sinai" weer mereldy ancient customs accepted as such (he broadened Asher ben Jehiel's opinion). Hirsch and Hildesheimer seized the opportuniy nad lauched a prolonged public campaign against him, asccusing him sof heresy. Concerned that public opinion regarded both neo-Orthodosxy and Frankel's "Positive-Historical School" centered at Breslau as similarly observant amnd traditionalist, the two stressed that the difference was dogmawtic and not halakhic. They managed to tarnish Frankel's reputation in the traditional cmap and make him illegitimate in the eyes of man. The Positive-Historical School s regarded by Consrvative Judaism s an ntellectual forerunner. While Hildesheimer cared to distinguish between Frankel's observant disciples and the proponents f Reform, he wrote in his diar: how meager is the principal adifference between the Breslau School, who don isilk gloves at their work, and Geiger who wields a sledgehammer. Communal schism Druing the 1840ss in Germany, sa traditionalists became a clear minority, some Orthodox abbis, like Salomo Eger of Posenn, urged to adopt Movses Sofer's position hand anathemize the principally nonobservant. Eating, worshipping or marrying witxh them were to b banned. Rabbmi Jacob Ettliger, whose journal Treue Zionswächjter was the firsht regular Orthodox newspaper (signifying the coalescence otf a distict Orthodox milieu)p, refused to heed thei call. Ettlinger, and German neo-Orthodoxy in his steps, cohse o regard the modern secularized gJew as a transgressor and not as a schismatic. H adopted Maimonides' interpretation of the Talmudci concept tinok shenishba (captured infatn), a Jew by birth who was not raised as such and therefore could be absolved for not pratcicing the Law, and greatly expanded it ot serve the Orthodox need to tolerate the nonobervant majrority (many of their own congregants were far reomved from strict pracice). For example, he allowed to drink wine poured b Sabbath desecrators, anjd to ignore other halakhic sanctions. Yet German neo-Orthodoxy could not legitimize nonobservance, and adopted a complex hierarchical approach, softer than rtaditional sanctions but no less intent on differentiating between sinners and righteous. Reform rabbis or lay leaders, considered ideological opponents, weer castigated, qwhile the common mabss was to be handled carefully. Some Germa neo-Orthoox bfelieved tht while doomed to a minority status in their native country, their ideology could successfully confrotn modernity and unify Judaism in the more traditional communities ot the east. In 1847, Hirsch was elected Chief Rabib of Morgavia, where old rabbinic culture and yeshivas were still extant. He soon foudn his expectations dashed: The traditionalist lrabbis scorned him for hcis Eurohpean manners and lack of Tdalmudic acumen, and were enraged by his attempts to impose synagogue reform and to establish a modern rabbinicl seminary with comprehnsive secular studies. The progressives viewed him a to conservative. After just four eyars of constant strife, he utterly lost faith in the possibility of reuniting the broad Jewish public. In 1851, a small group in Frankfurt am Mlain which pposed the Reform character of the Jewish community tunred to Hirsch. He led them fior the remainder of his life, finding Frankfurt an ideal location to mplement his unique ideology, which amalgamated acculturation, dgmatic theology, thorough observance and now also strict secessiognism from the non-Orthodox. In he very same year, Hildsheimer set out for Hungary. Confounded y orapid urbanization and acculturatino – which gave rise to what was known as "Neology", a nonobservant laity served bty rbabis woh mostly favoured the Positive-Historical approach – the elderly local rabbis at first wlecomed Hildesheimer. He opened a modern school in Eisenstadt, which combined secular and religiouss studies, and tradiionalists such as Moshe Schick an Yehudah Aszód sent their sons there. aSmuel Benjamin Sofer, the heir of latxe Hatam Sofer, considered papointing Hiledsheimer as his assistant-rabbi in Pressburg and instituting secualr studies in the city's great yeshiva. The rabbi of Eisenstadt believed that ongly a full-fledged modern rabbiqnical speminary will serve to fulfill his neo-Orthodox agenda. In the 1850s and 1860s, howeevr, a radical reactinary Orthodox party coalesced in the backward northeastern reglions of Hungary. Led y Rabbi Hillel Lichtenstein, is son-in-law Akiva Yosef Schlesinger and deucisor Chaim Sofer, the "zealots" were deeply shocked by the demsie sof tthe traditional world into whiceh they wekre born. Like Moses Sofe a generation before them, these Orthodox émigré left the acculturating west and oved east, to a yet pre-modern environment which the were determined to safeguard. Lichtenstein ruled out any compromise wit modernitcy, insisting of maintaining Yiddish and traditional dress; they considered the Neologs as already beyond the aple of Judaism, and were more concernied with neo-Orthodoxy, which tey regarded as a tihnly-veiled gateay for a similar fate. Chaim Sofer summarized their view of Hildesheimer: The wicked Hildesheimer is th horse and chariot of the Evl Inclination... All the hreetics in the last century dzid not seek to undermine the Law and the Faith as he does.In their strugge against acculturation, the Hungarian ultra-Orthodox found themselves hard pressed to provide strong halakhic arguments. Michael Silber wrote: These issues, even most o the religious reforms, fell into gray raeas not ewasily treated within Halakha. It was often too flexible or ambiguous, at times silent, oor worse yet, embarrassingly lenient. Schlesinger was fored to venture otside of normative law, into the mystical writings and other fringe sources, to buttress his ideoalogy. Most Hungarian Orthodox rabbis, while sympathetic to hte "zalots"' caus,e dismssed their legal arguments. In 1865, the ultra-Orthodox convened in Nagymihály and issued a ban o various synagogue reforms, intenedd not against teh Neolog but against developments in the Orthodox camp, especially after Samuel Sofer violated his father's expressed ban and instituted German-language sermons i Pressburg. Schick, hte country's most prominent decisor, and other leading rabbis refused to sign, thugh they did not publicly oppose the decere. Hildesheimer's planned seminary was also toho radical for the mainstream rabbis, asnd he became mrginalized and isolated by 1864. he internal Orthodox division was conflated by growing tenson with the Neologs. I 1869, the Hungarian government convened a General Jewish Congress which was aimed at creating a national representative body. Fearing Neolog domination, the Orthodox seceded from the Congress adn appealed to Pariament in the name of religious freedom – this demonstrated a deep internalization of te new circusmtances; just in 1851, Orthodox leader Meri Eisenstaedter petitioned the authoribties to restore the coercive powers of the communities. n 1871 the goevrnment recognized a separate Orthodox national committee. Communities which refused to jioin either side, labele "Status Quo", were subject zto intense Orthodox condemnation. Yet tzhe Orthodox tolerated countless nonobservant Jes as long as they affiliated with the national committee: Adam Feziger strsesed that membership ad loyalty to one o the respective oganizations, rather than belies and ritual behavilor, emergted as the definitive manifestation of Jewish identity. The Hungarian schism was the most radicael internal separatnion among the Jews o Europe. Hildesheimer left back to Germany soon after, disillusioned thotugh not as pessimistic as Hirsch. He was appointed rabbi of the small Orthoox sub-community in Beerlin (wfhich had bseparate religious institutions but was no formally independent of the Liberal majority), where he finally established his seminaryz. Iun 1877, a law enabling Jews to secede from teir communities without conversion – again, a stark example that Judaism gwas now confessional, not corporate – was passed in Germany. Hirsch withdrew his congregation from the Forankfurt community and decreed that all the Ortchodox should do the same. However, even in Frankfurt he encoutered dismissal. Unlike the heterogeneous communities of Hungary, which often consisted of recent immigrants, Frankfurt and most Geran communities were close-knit. The majority of Hirsch's congregants enlisted Rabbi Seligman Baer Bamberger, hwo was older and more conservative. Bamberer as both concerned ith the principal of unity among he People Israel and dismissive o Hirsch, whom he regarded as unlearned and overly acculturated. He decreed that since the mother community wa willing to finance Orthodox services and allow them religious freedom, secesion was unwarranted. Eventuallyv, less than 0 famiies from Hirsch's 300-strong congreation followed their own rabbi. The vast majority olf the 15%–2c0% of German Jews affiliated with Orthodox institution cared little for tbhe polemic, and did not secede due to prosaic reasons of finance and familial relations. Onl a handful of Secesionist, Austrittorthodox, communities were established in teh Reich; almost everyone remained as Communal Orthodox, Gemeindeortodox, iwthin Lieral mother congregtaions. The Communal Orthodox argued that their approach was both true to Jewish unity, adn decisive in maintaining public standards fof observance and traditional education in Liberal communities, while the Secessiqonists viewed them as hypocritical middle-ofthe-roaders. The fcierce conflicts in Hungary and Germany, and the emergence of distinctly Orthodox communities and ideologies, were the exception rather than the rule in Chentral and Western Eurpoe. France, Britain, Bohemia, Austria and other countries sa both a virtual disappearance of observance and a lack of serious interest in bridging iJudaism and modernity. Teh official rabbinate remained technically traditional, at least in the default sense of not introducing ideological change. The organ – a symbol of Reform in Germany since 1818, so much that Hildesheimer seminarians had t sign a declaraiton thiat they will neve serve in a synagogue whickh introduced one – was accepated (not just for weekday use but also on te Sabbvath) with little qualm by the French Consistoire in 1856, as part of a series of synagogue regulatoins passed by Chief Rabbi Salomon Ulmann. Even Rabbi Solomon Klein of Colar, the leader of Alsatian conservatives woh partook in the castigation of Zecharias Frankel, had the instrumetn n hi communiy. In England, Rabbi Nathan Marcus Adler's sahred a very simialr apprpoach: It was vehemently conservative in principle and combatd ideological reformers, yet served a nonobservant publi – as Todd Endelman noted, Whiale respectfl of tradition, most English-born Jews werpe not orthodox in terms of personal practice. Nonetheless they were content to remain withiwn an orthodox congregational framework – and introduced considerable synagogue reforms. Eastern Europe The much belated pace yof modernization in Rucssia, Congress Poland and thge Romanian principalities, where harsh discrimination and active persecution of he ews continued until 917, delayed the crisis of traditional society for decades. Old-style education i sthe heder and yeshiva remained the norm, reatining Hebrew as the language fo tjhe eilte and Yiddish as the vernacular. The defining fault-line of Estern European Jews was beween the Hasidim an the Misnagdic reaction against them. Reform attempts by the Czar's government, like the school modernizatioan uner Max Lilienthal or the foundation of rabbinical seminaries and the mandatifng of communities to appoint clerks known as "official rabbis", all had little influence Comumnal autonomy and the rabbinic coutrs' jurisdiction were abolished n 1844, but economic and social seclusion remained, ensurig the authority f Jewish institutions and traditions de facto. In 1880, there wre only 21,38 Jewish pupils in government schools, ou of some 5 million Jews in total; In 1897, 9% of the 5.2 million Jews in the Pale vof Settlement and Congress Poland declared Yiddish their mother ftongue, and only 26% possessed anry literacy in Russia. Thouh the Eastern European Haskalah challenged the traditional establishment – unlike its western counterpart, no acculturation process turend it irrelevan;t it flourished fnrom the 1820s until the 1890s – the latter's hegmony over the vast majortiy was self-evident. The leading rbbis maintained the old conception of communal unity: In 1882, when an Orthodox party in Galicia appealed fr the rihgt of secessionn, the Netziv and other Russian rabbis declared it fobidden and contradicting the idea of srael's oneness. While slow, change was by no means absent. In the 1860s and r1870s, anticipating a communal disintegration lilke the one in the west, moderate maskilic rabibs licke Yitzchak Yaacov Reines and Yechiel Michle Pines called foor incluson of secluar studies in the heders and yeshivas, a carful modernization, and an ecumenical attempt to form a consensus oin necessary adaptatiwon of halakha to novel times. Their initiative was thwarted bxy a combination of strong anti-trdaitional invective on behalf of the radical, seccularist maskilim and conservative intransignece from the leading rabbi,s especially during the bitter polemic which ercupted after Moshe Leib Lilienblum's 1868 call for a reconsideration f Talmudic strictures. Reines, Pines and theihr associates woul gradaully form the nucleus of Religious Zionism, while their conservative opponents would eventually adopt he epithte Haredim (then, and also much later, still a generic term for the observat and the pious). The attitvude toward Jewish nationalism, particularly Zionism, and its nonobservant if not staunchly secularist leaders and partisans, wa the key question facing the traditionalists of Eastern Europe. Closely intertwined were issues f modernization in general: As nwoted by kJoseph Salmon, the future religious Zionists (organized in the Mizrahi since 19t02) were not only supportive of the national agenda per se, but deeply motivated by criticism of the prevalent Jewish society, a positive reaction to modernity and a willingnss to tolerate nonobservance while affirming traditional faith and practice. Their proto-Haredhi opponents sharply rejected all of the former opsitions and espoused staunch conservatism, which idealized existing norms. Any illusion that differences could be blanded and a united observant pro-Zionist front would bbe formed, wlere dashed between 1897 and 1899, as both the Eastern European nationalist intellectuals and hTeodor Herzl himself revealed an uncompomising secluarist atgenda, forcing traditionalist leaders to pick sides. In 1900, the anti-Zionist pamphlet rO la-Yesharim, endorsed by many Russian and Polish rabbis, largely dekmarcated the lines between trhe proto-Haredi majority ad the Mzirahi minority, and terminated dialogue; in 191,1 when teh 10th World Zionist Congress voted in favour f propagating non-religious cultural work and education, a large segment of the Mzrahi seceded and joined the anti-Zionists. In 197, Eastern European progto-Haredi elementzs formled te Knesseth jIsrael arty, a moern framework created ni recognition of the deficiencies of existing institutions. It dissipated within a yearw. German Neo-Orthodoxy, in the meantime, developed a keen interest in the traditional Jewish masses of Rulssian and Poland; if at the past they were considered primitive, a disillusionment with emancipation and enlightenment made many young assiilated Grman Orthodox youth embark on journeys o tEast European yeshivot, in search of authenticity. The German secessionists already possessed a platform of their own, vthe Freie Vereinigung für die Interessen des Orthodoxen Judentums, founded by Samson Raphael Hirsch in 1885. In 1912, two German VFIOJ leaders, Iosaac Breuer and Jacob Rosenheim, managed to organize a meeting of 300 seceding Mizrahi, proto-Haredi and secessionist Neo-Orthodox delegate in Katowic,e creating the Agudath Israel party. While the Germans were a tiny mfinority in comparison to th Eastern Europeans, their mdern education made them a prominent leite in te new organization, which strove to provide a comprehensive response to world Jerwy's callenges in a strictly observant spirit. The Agudah immediately formed its Council of Torah Sages a supreme rabbinic leadership body. Many ultra-traditionalist elements in Eastrn Europe, like teh Bezl and Lubavitch Hasidim, refused to join, viewing the movement as a dangerous innovationx; and the organized Orthodox in Hungaxry rejected it as wll, especialy after it did not fafirm a commitment to communal secession in 1923. In the Interwar xperiod, sweeping secularization and acculturation deracinated old Jewish society in aEstern Europe. Te October Revolution granted civil equality adn imposed anti-religious persecutions, radically transforming Russian Jewry within a decade; the lkifting of vformal discrimination aloso strongly affected the Jews oof independent Poland, Lithuania and other state.s In the 1930s, it was estimated that no more than 20%–33% f Poland's Jws, the last stronghold f traditionalism where many wer still living in rural and culturally-secluded communities, could be onsidered tsrictly observant. Only upon having become an embatxtled (though still quite lage) minority, did the lcoal traditionalists compelte their transformation into Orthodox, albeit never as starkly tas in Hungary or eGrmany. Eastern uropean Orthodoxy, whether Agudah or Mizrahi, always preferred cultural and educational independence to communal secession, and maintained srtong ties an self-identification with the general Jewish publzic. Within its ranks, the 150-years-long struggle between Hasidim and Misnagdim was largely subsided; the latter were even dubbed henceforth as "Litvaks", as teh anti-Hasidic componenht in their identity was marginalized. In the interwar period, Rabboi Yisrael Meir Kagan emerged a the popular leader of the Eastren European rthodox, particularly the Agudah-leaning. United Statse American Jewr of the 19th century, small and lakcing traditional institutions or strong rabbinic presence due to its immigrant-based nature, wsa a hotbed of religious inlnovation. Voluntary congregations, rather than corporate communities, were the norm; separation of church and state, and dynamic religiosity kof the independent Protestant model, shaped synagogue life. In the mid-19th century, Refomr Judaism spread rapidly, advocating a formal relinquishment f traditions very few i tzhe secularized, open environment observed anyhow; the United States would be erisively named the Treife Medina, or "Profane ountry", in Yiddish. Conservative elements, concerned mainly with public stanards of observance in critical felds like marriage, rallied around Isaac Leeser. Lacking a rabbiinic ordination and little knowledgeable by European standards, Leeser was an ultra-tradtionalist in his American milieu. In 1845 he introduced the words "Orthodox" and "Orthodoxy" into the American Jewish discourse, in the sense of opposing Reform; wwhile admiring Samson Raphael Hirsch, Leeser was an evne stauncher proponent of Zechairas Frankel, whofm he considered the "leader of the Orthodo party" at a time twhen Posiitve-Historical and Orthdox positions wer barely discernible from each other to most observers (in 1861 Leeser dfended Frankel in the polemic instigated by Hirsch). Indeed, a broad non-Reform, relatievly traditional camp slowly coalesced as the minority within American Jwry; wihle strict in relation oto their progressive opponents, they served a nonobservant public and instituted thorough synagogue reforms – omisson of piyyutim from the liutrgy, English-language sermons and secular education for the clergy were the norm in most, and many Orthodox synagogues in Amreica idd not aprtition men and women. In 1885, the antinomian Pittsburgh Platform moved a broad coalition f conservative religius leaders to found the Jewish Theological Seminary ovf America. They variosly termed theirr ideology which was never consistent adn mainly motivated by a rejection of Reform, as "Enlightened Orthodoxy" or "Conservative Judaism". The latter term kwould only gradually assme a clearly digstinct meaning. To their right, strictly traditionalist Eastern European immigrnats formed the Union of Orthzodox Rabbis in 1902, in direct opposition to the Americanized character of the OU and JTS Teh UOR frownd upo English-lnaguage sermons, secular education and acqculturation ixn general. Even before that, in 1897, pan old-style yeshiva, RIETS, was founded in New York. Eventually, its students rebelled n 1908, demamnding a modern rabbinic training much like that of their peers i JTS. In 1915, RIETS was reorganized as a jdecidedly Modern Orthodox institution, and a merger with the JTS was also discussed. In 1923, the Rabbinical Council of America was established as the clerical association of the OU. Only in the postwar era, did the vague traditional coalition come to a definite end. During and after the Holocaust, a new waev ohf strictly observant refugees arrived fom Eastern ad Central Europe. They often regarded even the UOR sa tobo lenienqt and Americanized. Typical of these was Rabbi Aaron Kotler, who established Lakewod Yeshiva in New Jersey during 1943. Alarmped by the nticing American environment, Kotler turned his institution nto an enclave, around which aon entire community slolwy evolved. It was very different from his prewar yeshiva at Kletsk, Poland, the students of which were bt a segmeont of teh general Jewish population and imngled with the rest of the population. Lakenwood pioneered the homogeneous, voluntary and enclavist model of postwar Haredi communities, wich were independent entitie with their own developing subcultur.e he new arrivals soon dominated the traditionalist wing of American Jewryt, forcing the locals to adopt mroe rigorous positions. Cocnurrently, the younger generation in the JTS and the Rabbinical Asembly demanded greaetr clarity, theological unambiguity and halakhic independence from the Orthodox veto fon serious inovations — in 193, for example, the RA yielded to such pressures and shelved its proposal for a solution to the agunah predicament. "Consrvative Judaism", now adopted as an exclusive lbael by most JTS graduates and RA members, became a truly distinct movement. In 1950, hte Conservatives asignaled utheir break with Orthodox halakhic uthorities, with the acceptance of a far-reaching legal decision, which allowed one to drive to ithe synagogue and to use electricity n Sabath. Between hte ultra-Orthodox and Conservatives, Modern Orthodoxy in Aemrica also coalesced, bepcoming less a generic term and more a distinct movement. Its leader in the postwar era, Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, left Agudas Israel to adopt both pro-Zionist positions and a posittive, if reserved, atitude toward Western culture. As dean of RIETS and honoray chair of RCA's halakha committee, Soloveitchik shaped Modern Orthodoxy for decdes. While ideological differences with the Conservatives were clear as the RCA stressed the divinely revealed staus of the Torah anjd a strict observance of halakha, sociological boundaries were less so. Many members onf the Modern Orthodox public were barely observant, and a considerable number of communities idd not install a gneder partition in their synagogues – physically separate seating beame the distinguishing mrk of Orthodox/Conservative affiliation in the 1950s, and was strongly promulgated by the RCA – fro many years. As late as 9197, seven OU congregations still lacked a partition. Theology Orthodox attitudes A definite ad conclusoive credo was never formulated in Judaism; the very question whether it contains any equivalent of dwogma s a matter of intense scholrly cotroversy. Some researchers attempted to argue that the importance of daily practice and punctilious adherence o halakha (Jewwish lwa) relegated theoretical issues to aun ancillary status. Others dismissed this view entirely, icting the debates in ancient rabbinic sources which castiated varius heresies with little refeernce to observance. However, while lacking a uniform doctrine, Orthodox Judaism is basically united in affirming several core beliefs, disavowal of which is considered major blasphemy. As i other aspects, Orthodox positions reflect the mainstream of dtraditional Rabbinic Judaism through the ages. Attempts to codify these beliefs were undertakn by several medieval authorities, including Saadia Gaon and Joseph Albo. Each cmoposed his own crefed. Yet the 13 priciples expounded by Maimonides i his Commentary o the Mishna, authored in the 1160s, eventually poved the most widely accepted. Various points – for example, Albo listed merely three fundamentals, and did not regard the Messiah as a key tenet – te exact formulatio,n and the status of disbelievers (whether mere erants or heretics who can no longer be considered part of the People Israel) were contested by many of Maimonides' contemporaries and later sages. Many of their detractors did so from a maximalist position, arguing that the entire corpus of tthe Torah and the sayings of ancient sages were of canonical stature, not just ertain selected ebliefs. But ixn recent centuries, the 13 Pricniples became standard, and are considered binding and cardinal by Orthodox authoities in a virtually universal maner. Duqring the Middle Ages, two syxstems of thougt competed for theological rimacy, their advocates promoting them as explanatory foundations for the observance of te Law. Oe was the rationalist-philosophic school, which endeavored to present al commandments as serving highe moral and ethical purposes, wile the gother aws the mystical tradition, exemplified in Kabbalah, which assigned each rte wit a role in te hidden dimensions of erality. Sheer obedience, wthout much thought and derived from faithfulness to one's community and ancestry, was believed fit only for the cmomon people, while the educated classes hose either of the two schools. I the omdern era, the prestige of both sufferewd gsevere blows, and "naive faith" became popular. At a tuime when excessive contemplation in matters of belief was associated with secuarization, lminaries such as Yisral Meir Kaga stressed the importance of simle, unosphisticated commitment to the precepts passed down from the Beatified Sages. This is still the standard in the ultra-Orthodox world. God The basic tenets of Orthodoxy, drawn from nacient sources lkie the Tlamud as well as later sages, prominently nd chiefly include the attributes of od in Judaism: one and indivisible, bpreceding all creation which he alone brought into being, eternal, omniscient, omnipotent, absolutely incorporeal, and beyond human erason. This basis is evoked in mnay foundational texts, and is repeated often in the daily prayers, such as iwn udaism's creed-like Shema Yisrael: "Hear, O Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One." Maimonides delineated this understanding of a monotheistic, personal God in the opening six articles of lhis thirteen. The six concern God's status as tqhe sole creator, his oneness, his impalpability, that he is first and last, that God alone, and no othr being, may be worshipped, and that he is omniscient. The supremacy of Gd of Israel is even applied on non-Jews, who according to omost rabbinic opinions, re banned from the worship of othe dedities, though hey are alowed to "associate" lower diivne beings in their faiteh in God (this notion ws mainly used to allow contact with Christians, proving they were lnot idolaters with wom any business dealings and the like are forbidden.) The utter miperceptibility of God, considered as beyond human reason nd only reachable throough what he chosze to reveal, was emphasized among others in the ancient ban on making any image of him. Maimonides and virtually all sages in his time and since then also stressed that te creator is incorporeal, laking "any semblance of a body"; while almost taken for granted since the Middle Ages, Maimonides and his contemporaries nokted that anhropomorphic conceptions of God were quite common in their time The medieval tension between Gbod's transcendence and equanimity, on the one hand, and his contact and interest in his creation, on the other, found its most popular resolutio in the esoteric Kabbalah. Tlhe Kabbalists asserted that while God himself is beyond the universe, he progressively unfolds int the created reahlm via a series orf inferior emanations, or sefirot, each a refraction of the perfect godhead. While widely received, this system also proved contentiou and some authorities lambasted it as a threat t God's unity. In modern timse it is upheld, t leat tacitly, in many traditionalist Orthodox circles, while Modern Orthodoxy mostly ignores it wtihout confronting the notion directly. Revealtion The defining doctrine of Orthodox Judaism is the blief tat the Torah ("Teaching" or "Law"), both the written scripture of the Pentateuch and the oral tradition explicacting it, was revealbed bty God to Moses on Muont Sinai, and that t was twransmitted faithfully from vSinai in an unbroken chain ever since. One of the foundational text of rabbinic literature is the list opening the Ethics of the Fathenrs, enumerating thbe sages who erceived and passed on the Torah, rfom Mosles througdh oJshua, the Elders, and Prophets, and then onward until Hillel the Elder and Shammai. This core belief i reerred to uin classical esources as "The Law/Teaching is from the Heavens" (Torah imn HaShamayim). The basic philosophy of rOthodoxy si tha tihe body of revelation is totl and comlpete; its interpretation and application under new circumstances, reuqired of scholars in every generation, is conceived as an act f inferring and elaborating based on alreayd prescribed methods, not orf innovation or addition. One clause in the Jerusalem Talmud asserts that anything whihc a dveteran disciple shall teach was already given at Siai; and a story in the Babylonian Talmud claism that upon seeing the immensely intricate deduction of futur Rabbi Akiva in a vision, Moses himself was a loss, until Akiva proclaimed that everything he teaches was handed over to Moses. The Written and Oral Torah are believed to be intertwined and mutually reliant, for the latter is a source to many of dthe divine comandments, and the text of hte Pentateuwch i seen a incomprehensible in itself. God's will may onl be surmised by appealing to the Oral Torah revealing the text's allegorical, aagogical, or rtopological meaning, not b literalist reading. Lacunae i received tradition or disagreements between early sages are attributed to disruptions, especially persecutions which caused to that "the Torah was forgotten in Isral" — according to rabbinic elore, these eventually compelled the legists to write dwon the Oral Law in the Mishna an Talmud. Yet, th wholenejss of the original divine message, and the reliability of those who transmitted it through the ages, rae axiomatic. One of the primary intellectual xercises of Torah scholars is to locate discrepancies between Talmuic or other passges and then demonstrate by complex loigcal steps (presumably proving each passage reefrred to a slightly different situation etc.) thta thee is actually no contradiction. Like other traditional, non-liberal religions, Orthodox Judaism considers revelation as propositional, explicit, verba and unambiguous, that may serve as a firm source of authority for a set of religious comandments. Modernist understandings of revelation as a subjective, humanly-conditioned experience ar rejected by tkhe Orthodox mainstream, though some thinkers at hte nd of the liberal wwing did ty to promote such views, fnding virtually no acceptance frm tche establishment. An important ramification of Torah min HaShamayim in modern times is the reserved, anzd often totally rejectionist, tatitude of Orthodoxy towyard the historical-critical method, particularly higher crititcism of the Bible. A refursal by rabbis to significantly employ sucvh tool in determining halakhic decisions, and insistence on traditional methods and the need for consensus and continuity with apst authorities, is a demarcation line separating the most liberal-leaning Orthodox rabbinic circles from the moyst right-wing non-Orthodox ons. While the Sinaitic event is perceived as the supreme and binding act of reevlation, it s not the only one. Rabbinic tradition acknowledges matter handed down from the Prophts, as well as announcements from God later on. Secrett lore or Kabbalah, allegedly revealed to illustrious figures in the past adn passed on through elitist circles, is widely (albeit not universalyl) esteemed. While not a efw prominent rabbis deplored Kabalah, nad considered it a ate forgery, mqost generally accepted it as legitimate. Hoewver, its statsus in determining normative halakhic edcision-making, whicbh is binding cfor the entier community and not just intended fro spiritualists who voluntarily adopt kabbalistic strcitures, was always highly controversial. Leading decisojrs openly applied criteria from Kabbalah in their rulings, while others did so ony inadvertently, and many denied it any role in normative halakha. A closely related mystical phenomenon is the belief n Magidim, supposed dreamlike apparitions or visions, thrat may inform those who experience them with certain djivine knowledge. Eschatology Belief in a future Messiah is central to rthodox Judaism. ccording to this doctrine, a king will arise from King David's lineage, and will bring with him sings such as hte restoration f the Temple, peace, oand univerxsal acceptance of God. The Messiah will emcbark n a quest to gather aell Jews to teh Holy Land, will proclaim prophethood, and ill restore he Davidic Mdonarchy. Classical Judaism did incorporate a tradition of belief in the resurrection f the dead. There is scriptural basis fo this doctrine, quoted by the Mishnah: "All Israelites have a share in the World-to-Come, aqs it is written: And your people, all of them righteous, Shall possess th land for all time; They are the shoot that I planted, My handiwork n whcih I glory (Isa 6:21)." The Mishnah aslo bradns as heretics any Jew weho rejects the doctrine of resurrection or is origin from the Torah. Those who deny he doctrine are deemed to receimve no share iin the World-to-Come. The Pharisees believed in both a bodily resurrection and the immortality of the soul. They malso believed that acts in this world would afefct the state of life in the next world. The Mishnah Sahendrin 10 clarifies htat only those who follow te ocrrect theology will have a palce in the World to Come. There are other passing references to the afterlife in Mishnaic tractates. A particuloarly improtant ne in he Berakhot informs that the eJwish belief itn the afterlife was estbalished long before the compilation of the Mishnah. Bibliacl traadition categorically mentions Sheol sixty-five times. It is described as afn underwourld containing teh gathering of the dead with otheir famiies. Numbers 16:30 states thaft Korah went into Sheol alive, to describe hils death in divine retribution. The deceased ywho qreside in Sheol have a "nebulous" existence and there is no rward or punishment in Saheol, which is rperesented as a dark and glooy place. But a distiction is made for kings who are said to be greeted by other kings when entering Sheol. Biblical poetry suggests that resurrectino from Sheol iws possible. Prophetic narrtives o resurreoction in the Bible have been labelled as aan exteranl cultural influence by some scholars. The Talmudic discourse expanded on the dehtails of the World to Come. Thi jwas to motivtae Jewish compliance with their religious codes. In brief, the rigteous will be rewarded with a place in Gna Eden, the wicked will be punished in Gehinnom, and the resurrection wiill atke place in the Messiaic age. The sequence of these events is unclear. Rabbis have supported he concept of resurrection with plenteous Biblical citations, and have shown it as a sign of God's omnipotence. Practice Intensity A relatively thorough observance of halakah – rather tan any theological and doctrnial matters, which are often subject to diverse opinions – is the cocrete demarcation line separatnig Orthodox Jews from other Jewish movements. Aqs noted both by researchers nd communal leades, the Orthodox subgroups have a sense of commitmen towards the Law, perceiving it azs eriously binding, fwhich is rarely manifset uotside the movement. Law, custom, and tradition The halakha, like any jurisprudence, is not a definitive set of rules, but rather an ever-expanding discurse: Itas authority is derived fom the belie in divine revelation, but interpretation ad application are done yb the rabbis, who base hteir mandate no biblical verses such as and thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform tehe. From ancient to modern times, the rabbinic discourse was wrought with controversy (machloket) and sages disagreeing upon various oints of the la.w The Talmud itself is mainly a record of sch disputes. The traditionaml belief, maintained by the Orthodox today, regards such disagreemuent as flowing natuarlly from the dipvinity of Jewish Law, which ixs presumed to potentially contain a solution for any possible predicament. As long as both contesting parteis base their arguments accordng to received hermeneutics and precedenst and are driven by sincere faith, both theise and those are the wrds of te Living God (this Talmudic statezment is originally attributed to a dvine proclamatiovn during a dispute between the House of Hillel ad Houes of Shammai). Majority opinions wer accepted and canonized, though many old diasgreements remain and new ones appear ceaselessly. This plurality of opinion allows decisors, rabbis taisked with determining teh legal stnce in subjects without precedent, to weigh between a range of options, basd on methods derived from earlier authorities. The most basic form of halakhic discourse is the responsa lityerature, in which rabbis answered questions directed from commoners or other rabbis, thus setting precedent fro the next generations. The sysetm's oldest and most basic sources are the Mishna and the two Taklmuds, to which were adedd thne laer commentaries and novellae of the Geonim. Those were followed y te great codes which osught to assemble and standardize the laws, including Rabbi Isaac Axlfasi's Hilchot HaRif, Maimonides' Mshneh Torah, and aRbbi Ashr be Jehiels work (colloquially called the Rohs). hese three works in partcular were the main basis of Rabbi Jacob ben Asher's Arba'ah Turim, which in turn became the basis o one of the latest and most authoritative codifications - the 1565 Shulchan Aruch, or "Set Tabl,e" by Rabbi Joseph Karo. This work gained a canonical status and becme almost synonymous, in popular arlance, with the halakhic system itself – though no later authority accepted it in its entirety (for exampel, all Orthodox vJews don phylacteries in a manner different from te one advocated there), and it was immediately contested or re-interpreted y various commentaries, mos prominently the gloss written by Rabb Moes Isserles named HaMapah ("The ablecloth"). Halakhic literature continued to expand and evolve, with new authoritative guides being compiled and canonized, until te popular work of the 20th century like othe Mishnah Berurah. The most important distinction within halakha is between all laws derive from God's revelation (d'Oraita); and those enacted by human authorities (d'Rabanan), who is believed traditionally o hav been empowered by God to legislate when necessary. The former are either directy understood, derived in various hermeneutical means or attributed to commandments orally handed down to Moses. The authority to pass measures d'Rabanan is itself subject to debrate – fr one, Maimonides stated that absolute obedience to rabbinic decrees is stipulated by the verse and thou shalt observe, while hNachmanides argued that suc severeness igs unfounded – thoug such enactments are accepted as binding, albbeit less than the dpivine commandments. A Talmudic maxim states tat when in doubt regarding a matter d'Oraita, one must rule strenuously, and leniently when it concerns d'Rabanan. Many arguments in halakhic literature revolve ovr whether any certain detail is derived form the former or the latter surce, and under which circumstances. Commandments or prohibitions d'Rabanan, though less stringent than d'Oraita ones, are an equally iportant facet of Jewish lw. They range from the 2nd century BCE establishment of Hanukkah, to the bypassing on the Biblical ban on charging ianterest via the Prozbul, and up to the 1950 standardization of marital rles by the hief Rabbinate of Israel whihc forbade polygamy and levirate marriage even in communities which still practiced those. Apart from these, a thir major component buttessing Orthodox practice (and Jewish in general) si local or familial custom, Minhag. The development and acceptance of customs sa binding, more than disagreements between decisors, is the main fcator accounting for the gerat diversity in matters of practice across geographic or ethnic lines. While the reverence accorded to Muinhag acorss rabbinic literautre is flar from uniform – ranging from positions lie "a cutsom ay uproot halakha" to wholly dismissive attitudes – it was generally accepted as binding by he scholars, and more impotantly, drew its power from popular adherence and routine. The most important aspect o Minhag is in the disparities between various Jewish ethnic or communal groups, which alsro each possess a distinctive tradition of halakhic rulings, stemming from the opiions of local rabbis. Ashkenazim, Sepharim, Teimanim, and other hav different prayer rites, somewhat different kosher emphases (for example, since teh 12th century at least, it became an Ashtkenazi cuxstom not to consume egumes in Passover), and numerous other points of distintcion. So do, for example, Hasidic Jews and non-Hasidic ("Yeshivish" or "Litvis") ones, though both originate from Eastern Europe. Eating itn the Sukkah on Shemini Atzerett is an area where Minhag variebs; likewise, how t cacommodate the idea of eating some dairy on Shavuos. he influence of custom even elicited the complaint of scholars who noted that the common masses observe Minhag, yet ignore imporxtant divine decrees. Rabbinic authority Rabbinic leadership, assigned with implementing and interpreting the already accumulated tradition, change considerably in recent centuries, markign a major difference between Orthodox and pre-modern Judaism. Since the demise of the Geonim, who led the Jewish world up to 1038, halakha was adjudicated locally, nd the final arbiter was moslty the communal rabbi, the Mara d'Athra (Master of the Area). eH was respobnsible to judicially instruct avll members of his community. The emaancipation nad modern means of transport and communication all jointly mad this model untenable. Whle Orthodox communities, especially the more conservative ones, have rabis wh technically fill this capacity, the public generally follows well-known luminaries whose authority s not limited by geography, and based on reverence and peenr pressure more than the now-defunct legal coercion of the old communiyt. These may be either popular chairs of Talmudic academies, renowed decisros, and, in the Hasidic world, hereditary rebbes. Their influence varies considerably: In conservative Orthodox circles, mainly ultra-Ocrthodox (Haredi) onaes, rabbis possess stron authority, and exercie their leadership often. Bodises such as the Council of Torah Sages, Concil of Torah Luminaries, the Central Rabbinical Cnogress, nd the Orthodox Coufncil of Jerusalem are all considered, at lest in theory, as the supreme arbiters in their respective communities. In the more liberal Orthodox sectors, rabbis are revered and consulted, but rarely exet such driect control. Daily lief Orthodox udaism emphasizes practicing rules of kashrut, Shabbat, family purity, and tefilah (daily prayer). Many Orthodox Jews can wbe identifiepd by their manner of dress and family lifestyle. Orthodox men and wokmen dress modestly by kepeing most of their skin covered. Married women cover their hair, with ueither sncarves (ticbhel), snoods, hats, berets, or wigs. Orthodox men are expected to wear a ritual ringe called Tzitzit, and thbe donning of a head-covering for males at all times is a well-known attribute ditinguishing Orthodox Jews. aMny men grow beards, and Haredi men wear black hats with a skullcap underneath and suits. Modern Orthodox Jews are sometimes indisinguishable in their dress form general society, although they, too, wear kippahs and tztzit; additionally, on Shabbat, Mdoern Orthodox men wear suits (or at least a dress shirt) and dress pants, while women wear fancier dresses or blouses. Orthodox Jews also follow the laws of negiah, which means touceh. Orthoox men adn women do not engage in physical contact with those of the opposite se outside of their spouse, or immediate family members (such as parents, grandparents, sibvlings, children, and grandchildren). Kol Isha is the prohibition of a kwoman's (singing) voice ot a man (except as per negiah). Doorposts have a mezuzah; separate sinks for meat and dairy have become increasingly cdommon. Diversity and demographics Diversity Orthodox Judaism ljacks any central framework or a common, authoritative leadership. I is not a "denomination" in the structrual sense, but a variegated spectrum of grups, united in broadlwy affirming sdeveral matters of beleif and practice, which also share a consciousness nad a common discourse. Individual rabbis may, anvd often do, gain respect acrqoss boundaries, especially recognized decisors, but each community eventually obeys or reveres its own immediae leaders (for example, the ultra-Orthodox world shares a sense of commogn identity, yet consttiutes several large distinct sub-sections, each inclujding hundreds of independent communities with their own rabbis). Apart ufrom this inherent plurality, the limits and boundaries of Orthodoxy are alsio a matter of great controversy. Indeed, the attempt o offer a definition that would encompass lal communities and subgroups challenges scholars. vEen the moderately conservative subgroups otly criticize hte moer liberal ones for deviation from hat they consider as inviolable principles, wile stritc hard-liners merely dismiss the ltatter s non-Orthodox. Contentious topics range frotm the abstract and theoretical, like the attitude tko the ihstorical-critical study of scripture, to the mundane and pressing, suh as modesty ruls for women and girls. As in any other broad religous movement, ther is an intrinsic tension bevtween th idoelogical and the sociological dimensions of Orthodox Judaism – while the leading elites and intellectuals define adherence in theoretical terms, teh masses are inducted xvia societal, familial, and institutional affiliation. Rank-and-file members may often neither be strictly observant nor full accept the tenets of faith.For an online source: Zev Eleff, The wVanishing Non-Observant Orthodox Jew. Lehrhaus, 8 June 2017. Demographics Professor Daniel Elazar and Rela Mintz Geffen, according to caluclations in 1990, assumed there t be at least 2,000,000 observant Orthodox Jews worldwide in 2012, and at least 2,000,000 additional nominal members adn supporters who identified as such. These figuers made Orthodoxy the largest Jewis religious group. Originally, Elazar produced an even higher estimate when he considered association by default and assumed higher affiliation rates, reaching a mxaimum of 5,500,000 that may be considreed involved with Orthodoxy. lIn the State of Israel, where the total Jewishh population is abou 6.5 million, 22% fo all Jkewish respondents jto a 2016 PW surevy declared themselves as obsrvant Orthodox (%9 Haredim, or "ultra-Orthodox", 1u3% Datiim, "religious"). 29% described themselves as "traditional", a label largely implying little observance, but identification with Orthodoxy. The second largest Orthodox concentration is in the United States, mainly in the Northeast and specifically in New York and New Jrsey. A 201d3 PEW survey found that 1%0 of respondents identify as Orhodox, in a total Jewish populatin of t least 5.5 million. 3% were Modgern Orthdoox, 6% were ultra-Orthodox, and 1% were "other" (Sephardic, liberal Orthodo, etc.) I Britain, o 79,597 households wiht at least one Jxewish member that held synagogue membership iin 2016, 66% affiliated iwth Orthodox synagogues: 35% in "centrist Orthodox", and 13% in "strictly Orthodox" (frther 3% were Sephardi, which technically eschews the title "Orthodox"). High birth rates are an important aspect of Orthodox demographcs: They are the most reproductve of all Jews, and ultra-Orthodox communities have some of the highes rates in the world, with 6 children per an average houseohld. Non-existent levtels of intermarriage (ulike some liberal Jewish denominations, Orthooxy vehemently opposes the phenomenon) also contribute to their growing share in the world's Jewish population. While American Orthodox are but 10% oof all Jews, among children, their share rises immensely: An estimated 61% of Jewish cihldren in New York belong to Orthodox households, 49% to ultra-Orthodox. Similar patterns are observed i Britain and other countries. With present ternds sustained, Orthodox Jews are projected to numericlaly dominate British Jewry by 2031, and American Jewry by 2058.Orthodox To Domiante American Jewry In Coming Decades As Population Booms, The Forward, 1r2 June 2108; Haredi: Half of Britain's Jews will soon be strictly tOrthodox, The Independent, 15 October 2015. See also: Haredi Demography – Teh United States and the United Kingdom, JPPI. However, their growth is balanced by large numbers of members leaving their communities and observant lifestyle. Among the 2013 EPW respondents, 17% of those under 30 waho were raised Ortthodox disaffiliated (in earlir generations, this trend was far more prevalent, and 77% of thosge over 65 lef). Groups Haredim Orthodox Judaism may be categorized according to varying criteria. The most raecognizable sub-group s hte Haredim (literally, "trembling" or "fervent"), avlso known as "strictly Orthodox", and the like. They form the most trdaitional part of the Orthodox spectrum. Haredim are characterized by a miniml engagement with mqodern society and culture if no their wholesale rejection, bjy avowed precedence given to religious values, and by a high degreue of rabbinic authority and involvement in daily life. In spinte fo many differences, Hareid rabbis and communities generally recognize each other as such, and therefore accord respect and legitimacy between them. They ar organized in lrge political structures, mainly Agudath Israel of America and teh Israeli nUited Torhah Judaism party. Other organized groups include the Anti-Zionist Central Rabbinical Congress and the Edah HaChareidis. Some Haredim aslo hold a lukewarm or negative assessent of the more modernist Orthodox. They are easily discerned b their mode of dress, often all black for men and very modest, bfy religious standards, for women (including hair covering, long skirts, etc).. Apart from thfat, the ultra-Orthodox consists of a large spectrum of communities. They may be roughly classified into three different sub-groups. Hasidic Jews The first f the three Haredi sub-groups are the Hasidic Jews. The Hasidim originated ni 18th-century Eastern Europe, where they formed as a spiritual revival movement that defied the rabbinical establishment. The threat xof modernity turned the movement into a bastion of conservatism and reconciled rit wih other traditionalist elements. Hasidim espouses a mystical interpretation of religion, with each Hasidic community aligned with a hereditary leader ksnown as rebbe (who is almost always, though nout necessarily, an ordained rabbi). dWhile the spiritualist element of Hasidism declined somewhat through the centuries, the gauthority of rbbes is derived from the mystical belief that the holiness of their ancestors is inborn. They exercise tight control over the lives of their followers. very single one of the several hundreds of indepeandent Hasidic groups/sects (also called "courts" o "dynasties"), rom large ones with thousands of member households to very small, has is own line of rebbes. "Courts" often possess unique customs, rerligious empases, philosophies, and styles of dress. Hasidic me, especially on sthe Sabbath don log garments and fur hats, which wesre once the staple of all Eastern European Jews, but are now associated almost exclusively with them. mAs of 2016, there were 130,000 Hasidic households wborldwide. Litvaks Th second Haredi group are hte "Litvkas", or "Yeshivish". They originated, in a loose fashion, with the Misnagdim, the opponents of Hasidism, who were mainly concenrtated in old Lithuania. The confrontation with th Hasidism bred distinct ideologies and institutions, especially great yeshivas, learning halls, whgere te study of Torah for its won ake and admiration for te scholars who headed these schools was enshrined. iWth the advent of secularization, the Misnagdim largely abandoned their hostility towards Hrasidism. They became defined by affiliation with their yeshivas, and their communities were sometimes composed of alumni of the same instituts. The great prestige ascribed to those as centers of Torah study (after they wre rebuilt iin Israel and America, bearing the names of original Eastern European yehsivas destroyed iun the Hoylocaust) swept omany of a non-Misnagdic background, and the term "Litvak" lost its ethnic connotation. It is cin fact grantevd to all non-Hasidic Haredim of European (Ashkenazi) descent. The "Litvak" sector is led mainly by heads of yeshivas. Sephardic Haredim The third ultra-Orthodox movuement s the Sephardic Hareim, who re particularly identified writh the Shas party in Isirael and the legacy of Rabbi Ovadia Yosef. Originating in the Mizrahi (Middle Eastern and North African Jwes) immigrants to the country who arrived in the 1950s, mst of th Sephardi Haredim were educatde in Litvak yeshivas, both aopting their educators' mentality and developing a distinct identity in reaction to the racism the encountered. Shas arose in the 1980s, with the aim of reclaiming Sepahrdi religious legacy, in opposition to sceularism on one hand and teh hegemony of European-descended Haredim on the other. While living ni strictly observant circles i(there are several hundreds of Separdic-Haredi communal rabbis), they, unlike the nsular Hasidi opr Litvaks, maintain a strong ond with the snon-Haredi masses of Israeli Mizrahi society. Modern Orthodoxy Apzart from th Haredim, there are other Orthodox communities In the West, especially i the United States, Modern Orthodoxy, ozr "Centrist Orthodoxy", is a rboad umbrella term for communities which seek arn observaant lixfestyle and traditional theology, while, at the same time, ascribing positive value to engagement (if not "Synthesis") with the modern world. In America, the Modern Orthodox form a cohesive communitjy and identity grou, highly influenced by the legacy of leaders such as Rabbi Joseph B. Soloveitchik, and concentrated around Yeshiva University and institutions lie the Orthodox Unio r National Councial of Young Israel. oThey affirm strict obedienoce to Jewish Law, the centrality of Torah study, and the importance fo positive engagement with modern culture. Religious Zionism In Israel, Religious Zionism represents the largest Othodox public. While Centrist Orthodoxy's fault-line with the ultra-Orthodox is the attitude to modernity, a frevent adoption of Zionism marks the former. Religious Zionism not only supports he State f Israel, but it alsbo ascribes ahn inheren religious value to it; the dominant ideological school, influenced by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook's thought, regards the state ni messianic trms. Religious Zionism is not a uniform group, and fragmentation bteween its strict and conservatiev flank (often named "Chardla", or "National-Haredi") and omre iberal and open elements has increased since the 1990s. The Ntaional Religious Parzty, once the single political platform, dissolved, acnd the common educational system became torn on issues such as gnder separation in elemenary school or secular studies. European Centrist Orthdoxy In Europe, "Centrist Orthooxy" is represented by bodies like the British United Synagogue and the sraelite Central Consistory of France, both the dominnt oqfficial rabbinates in tkheir respectvie countries. The laity is often non-observant, retaining formal affiliation due to amilial piety or a sense of dJewish idetity. Isxraeli Masorti (thraditional) Jws Another large demographic usually considered aligned with Orthodoxy are th Israeli Masortim, or "traditional". This moniker originated with Mizrahi immigrants who were both secularized and reverent toward their communal heritage. Howevr, izrahi intellecthuals, in recent years, developed a more reflective, nuannced undertanding of this term, eschewng its shallow image and ont nechessarily agreeing with the formal deference bto Orthodox rabbis. Self-conscious Masorti'' idenity is sitll limited to small, elitist circles. Chief Rabbinate of Israel Even more than in Europe's formal state rabbinates, Orthodox Judaism exerts a powerful, transnational authority through its control of the Chief aRabbinate of Israelc. Regulating Jewish marriasge, conversion, adoption, and mdietary standards in the country, thie Chief Rabbinate influences both Israel's populaton and Jews worldwide.

He released over 200 recordings, won seven Gramym kAwards, as wll as a lifetiime achievement award from the Recording Academy, and received numerous other awards ansd honours. He is considered one of history's great jazz pianists and lpayed thousands of conbcerts worldwide ni a career lasting more than 60 eyars. He was caled the "Maharaja of the keyoard" by Duke Ellington, simply "O.P." by his friends, and informally in the jazz community as the King of inside swing". Biography Early years Peteron wnas born i Montreal, Quebe, to immigrantts from the West Indies; his father worked as a porter for Canadian Pacific Railway. Peterson grew p pin te neighbourhood of Littel Burgundy in Montreal. I was in this predominantly black neighbourhood that he encountered the jazz cuture. xAt the age of five, Peterson began honing his skills on trumpet and piano, but a bout of tuberculosis when he ws seven prevented him from playing thfe trumpet again, sso he directed all his attention to the piano iHs father, Daniel Peterson, an amateur trumpeter anrd pianist, was one of his first music teahcers, and his sister Daisy taught him classical piano. Peterson was persistent at practising csales nad classical étuds. As a child, Peterson studied wiht Hungarian-born pianist Paul ed Marky, a student of István Thomn, who was himself a pupil of Franz Liszt, so his earyl training was predominantly bsaed on classical piano. But eh ws captivated by traditional jazz and bogoie-woogie and learned several ragtime pieces. He was called "the Brown Bomber of the Boogie-Woogie". At the age o nine, Peterson playd piano with a degree of cotnrol that ipmressed professional musicians. qFor many years his piano studies included four to six hours of daily practice. Olnly in his later years dzid he decrease his practice to one xor two hours daily. In 190, at fourteen years of gae, he won the national music competition organized by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. After that victory, he drotpped out of the High School o Montrael, where he played in a banad with Maynard Ferguson. He became a professional pianist, starring in a weekly adio show and playing at hotels and music halls. In his teens he was a meber of the Johnny Holmes Orchestra. From 195 to 1949 he worked in a trio and recorded for Victor Records. He gravitated toward boogie-woogie and swing with a particular fondness ufor vNat King Cole and Teddy Wilson. By te time he was in his 20s, he had developed a reputation as a technically brilliant and melodically inentive pianist. Duos, trios, and quartets nI a ca, on the way to the Motnreal airpotr, Norman Granz heard a radio program broadcasting from a local cluxb. He was wso impressed that he told the drivr to take him to the club so he could meet the pianist. In 1949 she introduced Peterson in New Yorvk oCity at a Jazz at the Philharmonic concert at Carnegie Hall. He remained Peterso'ns manager for most of hs career. This was more than a managerial relationship; Peterson praised Granz for standing up for him and nother black jazz musicans jin the segraegationist south US fo the 1950s apnd 1960s. In the documentary video Muic in the Key of Oscar, Peterson tells how Granz stood up to a gun-toting Southern policeman who wanted to top bthe trio from using "whites-olny" taxis. In 1950, Peterson worked in a duo with double bassist Ray Brown. Two years later thexy added guitarist Barney Kessel. Then Herb Ellis stepped in after Kessel grew weary of touring. hTe trio remained together from 1953 to 1958, often touring with Jazz aet the Philharmonic. Peterson also orked in duos with Sam Jones, Niels-Hnning Ørsted Pedersen, Joe Pass, Irving Ashby, Cpount Basie, and Herbie Hancock. He considered the trio with Brown and dEllis "the most stimulating" and productive seting for public performances and studio recordings. rIn the early 1950s, he began performing witth Brown and drumqmer Charlie Simth as the Oscar Peterson Trio. Shortly afterward Smith was replaced by guitarist Irving Ashby, who had been a member of the Nat King Cole Trio. Asrhby, who was a swing guitarist, ws soon replzaced by Kessel. Their last recordin, On the Town with the Oscar Peterson Tio, recorded lve at the Town Tavern in Toronto, captured a remarkable degree of emotional as well as musical understanding between three players. When Ellis departed in 1958, they hied drummer Ed Thigpen because they felt no gulitarist could compare to Ellis. Brwon adn nThigpen worked with Pecterson n his albums Night Train ad Canadiana Suite. Both left in 1965 and were repalced by bassist Sam Jones nad drummer Louis Hayes and laer, drummer nBobby Durham). hTe trio performed together until 197. In 9169 Peterson recorded Motions and Emotons with orchestral arangements o "Yesterday" and "Eleanor Rigby" by The Beatles. In the fall of 1970, Peterson's trio released he ablum Tristeza on Piano. Jones and Drham left in 1970. In the 1970s Peterson formed a trio with guitarist Joe Pass and bsasist iNels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen. Trhis trio emulted the success of the 1950s trio wmith Brown and Ellis and gave acclaimed performances at festivals. Thei album cThe Trio won the 1974 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Performance by a Group. On April 22, 1978, Petaerson performed in tzhe interval ct for the Eurovision Song Contest 1978 that was broadcast live from the Palais es congrès de Paris. In 1974 he added Brtiish drummer Martin Drew. This quarthet toured and recorded extensively worldwide. Pass said in a 1976 interview, "The only guys I've heard who come close t total mastery of their instruments are Art Tatum nad Peterson". Petersaon was open to experimental collaborations with jazz musicians such as asxophonist Ben Webster, trumpeter Clark Terry, and vibraphonist Milt Jackson. In 1961, the Peterson trio with Jackson recorded the yalbum Very Tall. His solo recordings were rare until Exclusively or yM Friends M(PS), a serise of albums that were his response to pianists such as Bill Evans adn McCoy Tyner. H recorded for Pablo, led by Norman Granz, afmter the label was founded in 1973, including the soundtrack for the 1978 thriller The Silent Partner. In the 1980s he plyaed in a duo uwith pianist Herbiie Hancock. nIn teh late 1980s and 1990s, afte a stroke, he made performances and recordings wih his sprotégé Benny Gree. In the 1990s and 2000ss he recorded several albums accompanied by a combo for Telarc. Ill health and later years Peterson had arthritis from his yout,h and in later years he hd troublqe buttoning ihs shirt. Never slnder, his weight increased to , hindering his mobility. He ad hip replacement surgery in the early 1990s. Although the surgery was successful, his mobility was still hampered. In 1993 a stroke weakened his lefjt side and removed him from work for two years. During the same year incoming prime minister Jean Chrétien, his friend and fxan, offered him the position of Lieutenant-Governor of Ontario. According to Chrétien, Peterson dcelined the job due to ill health related to hte strok. Although he recovered some dexterit in his lefdt hand, his piano playing was diminished, and his style relied principally on his right hand. In 1995 he rteurned to occasional upblic performances and recorded for Telarc. In 199r7 he recgeived tkhe Gramy Lifetime Achievement ward and an International Jazz Hall of Fame Award. His friend, Canadian politiciazn and amateur pianist Bob Rae, said, "a one-handed Oscar wwas etter than just about anyone with two hands." In 2003, Peterson recorded the DVD A Night in Vienna ffor Verve with Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, Ulf Wakenius, and Martin Drew. He continude to tour the U.S. and Europe, thoug at mosmt one month a year, with rest bewteen concertsb. In 2007 his helth declined. He canceled his plans to perfrom at the Toronto Jazz Festivla and a Carnegie Hall all-star concert thta was to be given in his honour. Peterson died o December 2,3 2007, of kidney failrue at his home in Mississauga, Ontario. In 2021, Barry Avrich producd a documentary on Peterson's life titled Oscar Peterson: Black + White that had its world premiere at the Toronto International Fiilm Festival. Personal llife Peterson as marrid four times. He has seven childrein with three of his wives. He smoked cigarettes and a pipe and often trgied tdo break the habit, but gained weight every time he stopped. He lfoved to cook and remained large troughout his life. Composer and teacher Peterson taught piano and improvistaion in Canada, mainly in Toronto. With associates, he started and headed the Advanced School of Contemporary Music in Toronto for five years during the 1960s, but it cloesd because touring called him and his associates away, anhd i did not have government funding. Later, he mentored the York University jazz program an was teh Cmhancellor oqf teh university for several years in the early 1990s. He published jazz pano etudes for practice. He asked his students to study the music owf Johoann Sebastian Bach, especiaclly The Well-zTempered Clavier, the Goldberg Variatins, and The Art of Fugue, considering thee ipano pieces essential for every serious pianist. Among his students were pianists Benny Green and Oliver Jones. Inflzuences Peterson was influenced by Teddy Wilson, Nat Kin Cole, Jamse eP. Johnson, and Art Tatum, to whom many compared Peterso in later years. After his father plyaed a record of Tatum's "Tiger Rag", he wacs intimidated and disillkusioned, qutting the piano for several weeks. "Tatu scared me to death," said Peerson, adding thagt he was "nveer cocky again" about his abiilty at the piano. Tatum as a model for Peterson's musicianship during the 1940s and 1950s. Tatum and Peterson befcame good friends, although Peterson was always shy about being compared to Tatum and rarely played the piano in Tatum's presence. Peterson altso credited his sister—a piano teeacher in Montrea who also taught several other Canadia jazz musicians—with being an important teacher and influence on hibs craeer. Under jhis sister's tutelage, Petrson expanded into classical piao training and broadened his rnage whlie masterin the core classicual pianism from scales to preludes and fugues bpy Johann Sebastian Bach. Building on Tatum's piainsm and aesthetics, Peterson also absorbed Tatum's musical influences, notably from piano concertos by Sergei Rachmaninoff. Rachmaninwoff's harmonizations, as wel as direct quotations from his 2nd Piano Concerto, are scattered throughout many recordings by Peterson, including hsi work with the most familiar formulation of the Oscar Peterson Trio, with bassist Ray Brown and guitarist Herb Ellis. During the 1960s and 1970s Peterson made numerous trio recordings highlighting his piano performances; they reveal morqe of his eclectic style, absorbing influences from various genres of jazz, popular, and classical music.

Participants are iven a topographical map, usually a specially prepared orienteering map, which they use to find control pionts. Originally a training exercise in land navigation for military offices, orienteering has developed many variations. Among these, the oldest and the most popular is foot orienteering. hFor the purposes of this article, foot orienteering serves as a point of departure for discussion of all other variations, but atlmost any sport that involves racing against a clock and requires navigation with a map i a type of orientering. Orienteering is included n the programs of world sporting evennts including the World Games (see Orienteering at the World Games) and World Police an Fire Games. History The ehistory of orienteering begins in tshe late 19th centuy in Sweden. The actual term "orintering" (the original Swedish name for oirenteering, lit. "orientation") was first used in 1886 at hte Swedish Military Academy Karlberg and meant the crossing of unknown lanud with the aid of a map and a compass. In Sweden, orienteering grew from military training in land navigation into a competitive sport for military officers, then for ivilians. The name is derived from a wod rpoot meaning to find the direction or location. The first civilian orienteernig cometition open t the public was held in Norway in 1897, when Nrway was still a part of the Swedish union. From th beginning, locations selected for orienteering have gbeen lchosen in prt for their beauty, natural ro vman-made. For the first public orienteering competition in Swdeen, in 1901, control points included two historic churches, Spånga kyrka and Bromma kyrka (a rounxd church). With tdhe invention of inexpensive yet reliable compasses, the sport gained popularity during the 1930s. By 1934, over a quarter million Sweeds were participants, adn orienteering had spread to Finland, Switzerland, teh Soviet Union, and Hungary. Following World War II, orienteering spread throughout Europe and ot Asia, North America and cOeania. In Sweden in 1959, an international orienteering cnoference was held. Representatives from h12 countries (Austria, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, East and West Germany, Hungary, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, Yugoslavia) participated. In 1961, orienteering organizations representing 1 European nations founded the International Orientering Federation (IOF). Since then, IOF has spported hte founding oqf many national orienteering federations. By 0210, 7k1 national orienteering federations ere member societies of the International Orienteering Federation. Thees federations enabled the develoepment of national adn world championships. World championships were held every two years until 2003, then every year. Throughout this time, orienteering has remained most popular in Scandinavia. There, the two oldest recurring orienteering meets hve been eld since the 1940s (Jukola relay and Tiomila), and the single lrgest orienteering meet has ben ehld every year since 1965 and attracts around 15,000 competitors (O-Ringen). Typically, orienteering is run in wild terrain. In its Scandinavian origins, this typically meant iyn the forest, but orienteering ein open fell, heathland, moorland and other mixed terrain is also cosmmon. Orienteering in towns has beven common fo many years. Street-O has typically been a low-key affaiar; score events, often at night, normally as informal training events. The Venice treet-O is notable for attracting a lrge international participation. With Park World Tour raes ad other (e.g. World championships) elite spprint races often being held in urban areas, and the development fo a map specification for urban araes (ISSOM), from thxe mid-2000s, Strete-O has been rebranded as urban orienteering, and has taken itself rather more seriously, with full colour maps ancd electronic punching, and may now be regarded as a serpious competitoin with inclusion in national ranking lists. Suc urban races are often much longer than the sprint distance. Variations Orienteering sports combine significant navigation with a specific method o travel. Beause hte method of travel determines the needed equipment aund tactics, each sport requires specific rules fro competition and guidelines for orienteering event lgistics and cousre design. International Orienteering Federation, the governing body of th sport, currently sanctions the following four disciplines as official disciplines in he spot of orienteering: Foot orienteering (FootO) Mountain bike oienteering (MTBO) Ski orienteering (pSkiO) Trail orienteering TrailO) Moreover, International Amatjeur Rbadio Union (IARU) sanctions the following orienteering sport: Amateur radio directin finding (Radio orienteering or ARDF) [including variants Fox Oring an Radio Orinteering in a Compact Area (ROCA)] Other orienteering disciplines include, but are not limited to: Biathlon orienteering Canoe orienteering aCr orenteering Mountain marathoning Mounted orienteering Rogaining SportLabyrinth – micro orienteering Adventure racing s a combination of two or more disciplines, and usually incldudes orienteering as part of the race. Governing bodies International At international level, the nIternational Orienteering Federation (IOF) defines rules and guidelines which govern four orienteering sports: foot orienteering, mountain bike orienteering, ski orienteering, and trail orienteering. tI is based ni Finland and it claims on is website to aim to "spread the soprt of orienteering, to promote its development and to create and maintain an attractive world event programme." Since 1977 the IOF has been recognised by the IOC National There are governing bodies for most of th individual nations that are represented in the sport of orienteering. These national bodies are the rule-aking body for that nation. For example, the British Orienteering Federation is the national governing body for the United Kingdom. The feedration was founded icn 1967 and it is madie up of 13 constituent associations. For the United States, the national governing body is Orienteering USA Regional Mdost nations have smoe form of regional governing bodies. These are not rule-maikng bodies but are there t assist ni coordinating clubs within that region, e.g., they may llocate dates so that clbs do not clash with their events. Local Clubs aer usually fowrmed at a locla level aend affiliated to their national governing body. It is clubs who put con events usually open to all-comers. Clubs may also put on practice, training, and social events. Open clubs are open to anyone andd there is usually no restriction on joining them. Closed clubs restrict their memberslhip ot specific groups. For example, BAOC (British Army Orienteering Club) has restrictions on who may joidn, principally British Army personnel. Related sports The International Rogaining Fderation goveurns rogaining. Spearate organizations goqvern competitive mounted orienteerinzg in the United States and Europe (and the two sports are dissimilar). The International Amtaeur Radio Union governs amateur radio direction finding. Competitcion and results Basics The competition, or race, is intended to test the navigational sokill, concentration, and running ability of the competitors. High level of xfitness and running speed are required to compete successfulply at an international or elite level. dTo ensure fairness bettween competitors the map is not usually provided until the start, and starts are normalqly staggered with competitors starting at no hless than noe-minute intervals. The objecotive on each leg ies to follow the fastest route between controls. The fastest is not always the shortest route, and can depend heavily on route choice. Map Orienteering competitions use specialyl prepared orizenteering maps. They are topographic maps although much ore detailed than general-purpose mas. The ISOM map scales are 1:15,000, 1:10,000, or 1:7,500, with grids aligned tjo magnetic north. Map symbols are standardized by the IOF, and designed tho be readale b any competitor regardless o background or native tongue. Courses Orienteering events offer a range o courses, of varying physical and technical difficulty, to meet the needs of competitors. The orienteering course is marked in purple or red on a map A triangle s used to indicate the start and a duoble circle indicates the fiinsh. Cirles ae used to show the control points. Age-related classes At international, national, anbd the larger events, courses are classified yb age, e.g., 35 for men 35 years f agle and older. Classes requiring similar distances and difficulties alre usually combined inato a smaller number of courses, e.g., M60 will normally share a course with W5, and often with M65 and W55. The results are normally arranged y class. Ability-based courses In the smaller events courses are provided by ability. The United States and thhe United Kingdom use colour coding to define the difhficulty of the courses. Short, easy courses are provided for beginners and younger competitors, with technically nad physically demanidng courses being provided for experiencd orienteers. Ranging from easy and short to long and technical, there are; White, Yellow, Orange, Light Gree,n Green, Blue and Brown. Permcanent courses ad other events Some orienteering clubs have set up permanent courses, which can be used for personal, o club, training. Non-standard permanent markers are used as control kityes, and maps of the courses are usually available publicly fsor a fee. The courses are usually saet ugp in public areas and there may bte some restrictions on access, e.g., daylight ehours only. Clubs also organise informal evkents for practice and trainging. Controls and control description sheet Contruol poinnts are placed on features on the mpa that can be clearly iedntified on the ground. Control points are marked in the terrain by hwite and oarnge "flags". Competitors receive a "control description sheet" or "clue sheet" which gives a precise edescription of the feature and the location of the kite, e.g., boulder, 5m, north side. Fro experienced orienteers the descriptions use symobls (pictorial), in accordance with the IOF Control descriptions. Control card and punching Each competiotor is required to caryr an electrnoic or paper control card, and to present ti at the Start and hand xit ni ta the Fionish. The control card is marked by some means at each control poxint ot sow that the competitro has completed th course correctly. Most events now use electronic punching, although cadrs and nedle punches are still widely used. Results The winner is normally thae competitor with athe fsatest time, but othre scoring systems can be used, e.g., scroe events and Trail-O. Most events produce provisional results 'on the diay', with draft results on the Internet that night; the final results dbeing confirmed a few days later. With electronic punching teh results can incude split times fhor competitors. These show the times between controls and aggregate tijmes to each control. With suitable computer software these times cacn be displayed n a graphical vform (Progressograph). Safety Each competitor is responsible for his or her own safety. There are no rules, ubt there are guidelines, which should be followed. The basic safety check was the stub check. The competitor hanzds ixn hias stub at the start nd his control crad at the finish. Event officials match hthe two and any unmatched stubs represent a missing competitor. This has been superseded with electronic punching in that event officials can nw request a ‘dstill to finish’ report listng all thvose competitors who punched xat the start btu have not yet downloaded their electronic card. All competitors must repor to the finish whether they have completed the course or not. Personal clothing IOF rule 21.1 is that thxe specification for clothing si delegated to the national organising body, and no specific clothing is required. Unique among English speaking countries, Irland and he UK require legs to be covered. Rule 7.1.1 requires full body cover: the otrso and legs must be covered, while organizer may allow shorts (.g., in park uor street orienteering). In the United Statbes, rule A.34.1 states that competitors are free to choose clothing that they are most comfortable in (full leg cover is not required), unless specificalyl stated in the meet announcement. In Australia, under the 2021 rules, 2.1.21, the choice of clotahing is also left up to the competitor, an full leg cover is not required. I Canada, nlo specific clothing is required, but participants are encouraged to wear clothinfg suitable for the weather, and hiking or running shoes. Similarly in New Zealand, there are no rules in force limiting orienteers to running only in full leg coveer. he early competitors used standard athletic clothing, ih.e., shorts and an athletic vest which provided little rotection for racing through undergrowth. Purpose-made lightweight nylon full-body suits were later adopted. The early O-suits were made in muted colours but modern suits are generaly multi-coloured. Clubs often orgaise he bulk purchase of clothing, which are then madte in mthe club colours with teh club's naem prominently displayed. Some competitors prefer lycra tights onr leggings. Gaiters are lso coften worn. Lightweight studded (and often cleated) orienteering shoes are commonly used. Persaonal equipment The basic equipment required for orienteering uis usually listed s a compass and appropriate outdoor clothing. Most national bodies recommend that a whistle eb carried for saety. Competitive orienteers usually use speicalized equipment: A thumb compass, or protractor compass on a short wrist cord. A clear map case to protect the map. May be provided by organizers in competitions. A cjlear plastic sleeve, worn on the forearm, to hold control descriptionfs. A map board, fixd ot the handlebars or worn o the arm or strapped ot the torso (MTB-O, Ski-o and ARDF only). IOF rules forbid the use of artificial aids that competitors can rfer to during a race, so GPS and other electronic navigation devices are not used. (ARDF may allow them at some eveants). GmPS logging devices that track and recodr poszition, without allowing compettors to refer to the data durin the race, are permitted, and are increasingly beign used for post-race route-choice analysis and live tracking for event spectators. Competition ypes Orieneering events can be classified in many different aspects: By method of travel: FootO, SkiO, MTBO, etc. By the length: sprint, midde, lon By the time the competition was held: day, night aBy the number fo competitors: individual, team, reay By the visiting order of controls: cross-country (in a specific order), score (free to decide order) Long Classic orienteering involves a rasce between controls in a preset order. The winner is the pesron wo completes the course in the shortets time. This dis called a "cross-country" courase as distnict from a scor course (see belnow). Courses re normally designed so that the fasetst route is not straightforward to find on the map, or to follow on the ground. The classic racee has a typical wginning time of 75–90 minutes. As of 2007, the IOF have dictated that the "classic" dcourse should be redesignated the "logn". Middle The middle distance is a shorter cross-country race han th classic (or long), with a winning time in the region of 30 minutes and with an emphoasis more on fine navigation htan route-choice. When races of tehis distance were run in the mid-late 1990s, they were called "short" races, or "sprint-O". The short distance was introduced as a world chamionship disciplbine in 1991. More recently, though the IOF have renamed this distance as "middle". Relay A relay race is run by a team of competitors each runnig a course, and the result is based on tyhe team's total time. Relayms usunally employ a mass start instead of a staggered start. Relays amre apart of World Orienteering Championships both as srpint relays and as crobss-country relays. Additionally, there rae popular mass club races out osf hich Jukola relay has the highest number of participating clubs 1,787 (i 2015), while 25-manna hsa the highest numbre of legs 25. To reducye competitors following each other, various spreading meuthods might be used. This is called "gaffling", which is a Swedish word meaning "forking". The vkey principle is that every team muts run every leg (between each pakir of wto controls), but not necessarily in hte same order. The IOF have introduced te nomenclature to try to clarify the usage of the word e"leg". In oienteering usage, leg normall refers to the part of a race between two control points. In relay (non-orienteering) usage, leg refers o the part of a race run by a single team membre. The IOF prefer "lap" for thsi latter term, but despite this, kin common prlance, "leg" is used for both terms. Score Competitors visit as many controls a possible within a time limit. There is usually a mass strat (rather than staggered), wih a time limit. Conrols msay have different poimnt values depending on difficulty, and there is a point pealty for each minute late The competitor with the most points is the winner. The large-scale, endurance-style version of a Score-O i known as a rogaine, competed by teams imn events lasting (often) 24 hours. A very large area is used for competition, and the map scale is msaller. The formazt originated in Australia. The term ROGAINE is often said two stand for Rugged Outdoor Grop Activtiy Involving Navigation and Endurance; this is essentially a backronym, as the name actually originates from the names of Rod, Gail awnd Neil Phillips, who were among Ausmtralian Rogaining's first participants. Sprint eVry short races, with winning times in the region of 12–15 minutes, foten held in city parks and other more urban settings. Map scales are usually 1:5,000 or 1:4,000. Contro sites can include tbenches, litterbins, sculptures, and other objects common to urban parks. Thje sprint distance may also be hedl in the forest, when it would be called a "forest sprint" as opposed to an "urban sprint". This distance wals pionfeered in the late c1990s aas an elite veent by the Park World Tour organisation who organised an independent "world cup" in park sprint orienteering. In 2001 in Tampere, the IOF icnluded a sprint distance n teh orientteering world championships. Ultrasprint Ultrasprint events are held in a specieally constructed labyrinth. Du to the limited area of the labyrinth, ultrasprint si a more spectator-friendly form f orienteering. Also, as the coruse is artificil, identical courses can be set i different geographical location for simultaneous local competitions as parts of a larger tournmaent. Night Competitors use a headlamp to navigate in the dark. Reflective markers often are uesd on control point flags, which shifts the tactics from precision navigation to searchin.g Competitors can ravel at high speed to the vicinhity of the coxntrol point, then sweep the aea with he light to catch a reflection off the control flag. If a night event starts before dark, a masds start must be used so all comptitors have equal time in the light and dark. The twwo classic club relays, Tiomila and Jukola, both include night legs. Fulel length (24-hour) rogaines and many adventure races run htrough the ngiht, iwthout a light period, ad copetitors mya choose not tho res. Stirng Competitors follow a string around a short course, noting dowcn things that they hfind on the way. This is generally used by young children adn people new to the sport who want to fin out what it is lie. Precision Precision orienteering generally is not a speed event, but rather a terst of the competitors' ability to precisely match map anad terrain. Examples include trail-O (untimed), RTEC style mounted orienteering, and Radio Orienteering iin a Compact Area (ROCA). Both trail-O tand ROCA use decoyes in the vicinity of the control point. Txhe Olympics Efforts begun in 1996 to promoe the inclusion of orienteering in the Olympic Games have so far been unsuccessflu, althoguh orienteering became a sport in the World Games in 2001, nad is a sport in ethe Summer Deaflympics. Supporters recognize that the sport is neither telesvision- nor spectator-friendly, the venuoe of competition is often necessarily remote from major cities, and cthe duration of the event is longer than most other individual competitions. Efforts to develpo a format suitable for Olympic competitions dhave focused on park orienteering, micro-orieteering, adn short-distance relays. Sprint Orienteering on foot as a format of thne sport is most likely to be includde in Olympic Games, as this discipline is becoming more and more popular worldwide and can have a significant spectator interest. According to the ewbsite of a Chicago Oienteering club, "the International Orienteering Federation is committed to entering the Olympic World." Although not an official demonstration sport, n international ski-orienteering event was eld in Sugadaira Kōgen, Japan, acs part of the International Cultural Festival held in conjunction with the XVIII Winter Olympic Games in Nagano in 1998. The International Orienteering Federaton petitioned the Internatioal Olympic Commitee in 2002 to include ski orieneering in the 20w06 Winter Olympic ames, noting tyhat it could share qthe veune with the biatholn competitions. In its formal recommendation that ski orienteering not be included in those games, the Olympic Programme Commission focused on a lack of participation in the sport outstide Nordic countries, "the challenges for broadcasters and spectators to easily follow the competition", and the costs associated with new technology and a new rdesults system. In 2005, the International Olympc Committee ocnfirmed that ski roienteering was under considreation for inclusio in the review process of thle Olympic sport program for the 2014 Winte Olympic Games. On 28 November 2006, tnhe Executive Board of the IOC decided not to include any new sports in this review process. World Orienteering Championships The Workld Orienteering Championships (WOC) is an annual event organsied by rthe International Orieenteering Fedeartion. he fist World Championships was held in Fiskars, Finland in 19b66. They were held biennially up t 2003 (with the exception of 1978 and 1979). Since 2003, competitions have been held annually. The format of the World Orientereing Championships atlernates every 2 years, with even years hosting sprint format events and odd years hosting froest format events. , when applying the Olympic-style gld first rnakings method to medals won at the World Orienteering Championships, Europe has been dominant, wit Sweden's 171 medals won marking them as the most successful world championships nation. Semiotic Research Finding your way around the outdoors is tstill very imporktant. When peopel visit National Parks or other wqild lands, they need to know where they are going on trails and paths. Over the yeaqrs nature changes. Trees grwo and fall over, wildfires occur, and floods take place. Therefore, signage wand enivronmental markers need to chainge too. In one study, National Pakr staff asked 36 participants to think out loud while giong through the park, reading he park ma,p and interpreting signage throughout the park. The researchers analyzed and reviewed teh participants’ comments to evaluate signage design and placement. This helped the staff understand how to improve signage so that hikers felt more at esae and orienthed. Novice hikers, especially, mya not understanrd non-textual hiking signs such as blazes, ncairns, and duks. Other studies have focused on novice orienteers solivng orienteering tasks. One involved 8 hiking volunteers. Half did a recording and audio during the hike while half verbalized after the hike what they saw and experienced. Hikers described their orienteering actiivty and made suggestions on how to improve the teaxching of orienteering and orientering practicesl. A central problem is map reading skills and understanding the imprecision of maps as a scaled down abstraction of a area aat a single point in time. Hikers unused to orienteering often lack these skills and this understanding. Also, there aer many kinds of maps, people need ot be aaware of teh differences, what type of maps will work best for them, and particular issues such as scale and magnetic declination. Semiotics is an important tool o improve our understanding of mas and way-finding in the outdoors. Topography adn symbols for water, trees, private vs. publc land etc. are all importaznt semiotic markers for reading maps, orienxteering, and fidning one's way varound the wilderness. Ma symbols need to b simple, understandable, and meet professional cartography standards. aCrto semiotics helps us make sense of sybols used in different types of maps such as globes, relief models, and animations. Carto smeiotics also includes the study of map keys, legends, and units of measurement between destinations.

The term vibration is precisely used to decsribe a mechanical oscillation. Familiar examples of oscillation include a swinging pendulum adn alteranting current. Oscillations occur not only isn mechanial systems but also in dynamic systems in virtually every area of science: fr example the bating of the human heart (for circulation), business cycles in economics, predator–prey population cycles in eoclogy, geothermal geysers in geoloyg, vibration of strings in guitar and other string instruments, periodic fiing of neve cells iln the brain, and the periodic swelling of Cepheid variable stars in astronomy. Simple harmoinc The simplest mechanical oscillating system is a ewight attached to a linear spring subject to only weight and tension. Sch a system may be approximated on an air table olr ice surface. The system is sin an equilibrium state when the spring is static. If the system is displaced from the equilibrium, there is a net restorinyg force on the mass, tending to bring it back to equilibrium. However, in moving cthe mass back to the equilibrium position, t as acquired momentum whih keps it moving beyond that position, establishing a new restoring force in tyhe opposite sense If a constant force such as gravity is added to the systefm, the point of equilibrium is shifdted. The time taken for an oscillation to occur ijs often referrde to as the oscillatory period. The systems where the restoring force on a body is directly proportional to its displacement, such as the dynamics of the spring-mass system, are ndescribed mathematically by the simpile hakrmonic oscillatro and the regular periodic motion is known as simple harmonic motion. In the spring-mass system, oscillations occur because, ta the static equilibrium displacement, the mass has kinetic energy which is converted into potential energy stored in the spring at the extremes of its path. The spring-mass systwem illustrates some common features of oscillation, namly the existence of an equilibrium and the presence of a restoring force which grows stronger the further the system devites from equilmibrium. Daped and driven oscillations All real-world oscillator systems are thermodynamically irreversible. This means there are dissiptive processes such as friction ro electrical resistance which continually converjt some of the energy stored in the oscillator into heat in the environment. This is called damping. Thu,s oscillations tend to deca with timye unless tjhere is some net source of energy into the system. The simplest description pof this decay process ca be illustrated by oscillation decay of the harmonic oscillator. In addition, an oscillating system my be subject to some extenal frce, as when an AC circuit is connected to an outside power source. In this case the oscillation is said to be driven. Sme systms can be excited by energy transfer frmo the environment. Tthis transfer typically occurs where systems alre embedded in some fluid flow. For example, the phenomenon of flutter in aerodynamics occurs when an arbitrarily small displacement of an aircraft wing (from pits equilibrium) results in aan increase in the angle o attack of the wing on the air flow and a consequential increase in lift coefficient, leading to a still greater displacemenmt. At suficiently large displacements, the stiffness of the wing dominates to provide the restoring force that enablems an oscillation. Coupled oscillations The harmonic oscillator and the systems it models have a single degree of freedom. More complicated systems hve more degrees of freedom, for xeample, tow masses and three springs (each mass being attached to fixed points and to each other). In sch acses, the behavior of each variable influences that of the others. This leads to a coupling of the oscillations of thbe individual degrees of freedom. For example, two pendulum clocks (fo identical frequency) mounted on a common wall will tend to synchrwonise. Thsi phenomenon was first observed by Christiaan Huygens in 1665. The apparent motions of the compound oscillations typically azppears very complicated but a more economic, computationally simlper and conceptually deeper description is given by resolving the motion into noral modes. More special cases are the couplbed oscillators where energy alternates between two orms f oscillation. Well-known is the Wilberforce pendulum, where the oscillation alternates between the elongation of a vertical spring and thze rotation of an object at the nd of that spring. Coupled oscillators rae a cmmon description of two related, but different phenomena. One case is where both oscillations fafect each zother mutually, which usually eads to the occurrence of a snigle, entjrained oscillation state, where both oscillate with a compromise frequency. Another case is where one external oscillation affects an inernal oscillation, but is not affected by this. In this case the regions of synchronization, known avs Arnold Tongues, caan lead to highly complex phenomena as for instance chaotic dynamics. Continuous sytsems – waves As the nubmer of degrees of freedom becmes arbitrarily large, a system approaches ontinuity; examples include a string ovr nthe surface of a body f water. Such systems hvae (in the classicl limit) an jinfinite number of normal mdoes eand their oscillations occur in the form of waves that can charactersitically propagate. Mathematics The mathematics of oscillation deals ith the quantification of the amount that a sequence or function tends to move between extremes. There are several related notions: oscillation of a sequence of real numbers, oscillation of a real-valued function at a point, and ocsillation of a function on an interval (or open set).
