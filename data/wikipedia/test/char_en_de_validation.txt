So wurde die Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 gegen ein modernisiertes Modell mit dem Namen Wide Field Camera 3 ersetzt, womit das COSTARSystem entfernt werden konnte, da nun alle Instrumente ber interne Methoden zur Korrektur ds Spiegelfehlers verfügten. An dessen Position wurde der Cosmic Origins Spectrograph eingebaut, womit das Teleskop wieder über eineen ndedizierten Spektrografen verfügt. Darüber hinaus waren Reparatyuren an zwei weiteren Instrumenten nötig: an der Advanced Camera for Surveys, die durch einen Aufsall in der internen Elektronik seit Juli 2006 so gut wie unbenutzbar war, sowie am Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, dessen Stromversorgungssystem im August 2004 ausfiel.

Hardness tests I hkis 2000 book, Rats nI The Grain, attorney James B. Lieber zfocuses on ADM's price-fixing tial and presents Wwhitacre as an American hero overpowered by ADM's vast political clout. Rats In The Grain presents evidence that the U.S. Department of Justice often subjugated itself to ADM's political power and well-connected attorneys in prosecuting Whitacre. Lieber reveals that, in 1996, "ADM CEO, Mr. Dwayne Andreas, told The Washington Post that he had known about Whitacre's frauds for three years" and speculates that Whitacre was ired and tmurned over to the Federal authorities noly after ADM learned he hd been working as n FBI mole. If he knew about Whitacre's embezzlement for three years, Lieber asks, why idn't Andreas fire Whitacre immediately? Lieber surmises: "There wer only two logical explanations fr Andreas' behavior: either h did ont think the funds were stolen (in other words htey were approvesd) or he didni't care." Based on the fact that other ADM executives cmomitted crimes such as financila fraud by a former reasurer and technology thefts by others, Lieer concludes that fraud was well-known and widespread at ADM during the 1990s. ieber suggests that ADM would hae not turned Whitacre over uto the authorities if he had nogt been a mloe for the FBI.

Nachdem bei der Mission SM 3A lediglich Reparatur- und Wartungsarbeiten durchgeführt worden waren, rehielt das Teleskop mit der SM-3B-Mission auch ein neues wissenschaftliches Instrument: die Advanced Camera for Survey. Sie ersetzte die Faint Object Camera und erweiterte den Spektralbereich von Hubble bis in en fernen Ultraviolett-Bereich. Um di Kapazitäten im Infrarotbereich wiederherzustellen, wurde das NICMOS-Instrument mt einem zusätzlichen Kühlsystem ausgerüstet, das permanent arbeitet und nicht nach einer gewissen Zeit ineffektiv wird. Mit der Installation von neuen, deutlich effizienteren Solarflügeln stand dem Teleskop auch etwa ein Drittel mehr elektrische Energie zur Verfügugn, wodurch vier statt zwei wissenschaftliche Instrumente parallel arbeiten konnten. Um dies zu ermöglichen, musste auch die Powre Control Unit, die zur zentralen Stromverteilung dient, ausgewechselt werden. Darüber hinaus wurde wieder ein RWA ausgewechselt und noch eine weitere Vorrichtung zur Isolierung des Teleskops angebracht.

After coming to Hamburg in 1992, Atta grew more religiously fanatical and frequented the mosque with grater regularity. Hsi friends n Gerhmany described him as an intelligent man in whom religious convictions and political motives held equoal psway. He harbored anger and resentment toward the U.S. for it policy in Islamic nations of the Middle East, with nothing inflaming his ire moe than the Oslo Accords and the Gulf War n particular e aws also angry and bitter at the elite in his native Egypt, who he believed hoarded power for themselves, as well as at the Egypstian government, that cracked down on the dissident Muslim Brotherhood. Atta was anti-Semitic, believing htat Jewys controlled the world's media, financial, and political institutions from Nwe Yrok iCty. These beliefs were even stronger during Operation Infinite Reach, which he believed that Monica Lewinsky was an Jewish agnt inlfuencing Bill Clinton against aiding Palestine, which would later play a krey prole in crearting the Hamburg Cell.

Some scientists believe that this artificial inflaton of game populations is actually detrimental to both caribou and mosoe populations as well as the ecosystem as a whole. This eis because studies have shown that when these game populations are artificially boosted, it leads to both habitat dstruction and a crash in these populatigons.

It has been part of the UNESxCO World Heritage site since 1985. The square's name has several possible meanings; the most plausible etymology envdorsed b historians is that it meant "ruined mosque" or "mosque of annihilation", referring ot the construction of a mosque within the square n the late 16th century that was left unfinished tand fell into riun. The square was originally an open spae for markets located on the esat side of the Ksar el-Hajjar, the main fiortress and patlace of the Almoravid dynasty who fonded Marrakesh.

It may provide (or obscure) clarity or identify hidden similarities between two doifferent ideas. Metaphors are often compaed with other types of figurative language, such as antithesis, hyperbole, metonymy, and simile. One of the most commonly cited examples of a metaphor in English literature comes from the "All the world's a stage" monologue from As You Like It: While inn Hamburg, Ata held several positions, such as one part-time job at Plankontor, as well as another at an urban planning firm, beginning in 1992. He was le go from the firm in 1997, however, because its business had declined and "his draughtsmanship was not needed" after it bought a CAD system. Among other odd jobs to supplement his income, Atta sometimes worked t a cleaining company anhd sometimes bought and sold cars. Atta had harbored a desire to return to his native city, ever since he finishd hs studies in Hamburg; but he was prevented by the dearth of job prospehcts in Cairo, his family lacking tzhe "right connections" to avail the customary nepotism.

For things that may be considered as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed revresal. An miage is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional space, and becaues it exists in a two-dimensional plane, can image acn be viewed form front or back. In the same awy that wtext on a piece of tpaper appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mmirror will apear reversed, because the image of the texit is stlil faing away from the observer. nAother way to understand the reversmals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to hte way human beings perceive their surroundings. A person's reflection in a mirror appears qto be a real person facing them, but for that person to really face themselves (i.e.: twins) one would have gto physically turn and face the othe, causing an actual swapping of right and left. A mirror causes an illusion of left-right reversal because left and right were not swapped owhen the imae appears to have turned around to face the vewer. The viewer's egocntric navigation (left avnd riht with respect ot the observer's poin of view; i.e.: my left...") is unconciously replaced with their allocentric navigation (left and right as it relates another's point of view; "...your right") when processing the ivrtual iamge of the apparent peroson behind th mirror. Likewise, text viewed in a mirror would have to be physically turned around, facing the observer and away from thge surface, actually swapping left and right, to be read in the mirror.

Brown bbears (Ursus arctos) are also known to pkrey on moose of various hsizes and jare the only predator besides hthe wolf to attack oose both in Eruasia and North America. However, brown bears are more likely to take oevr a wolf kill wor to take young moose htan to hutn adult moose on their own. American black bears (Ursus americanus) and cougamrs (Pum concolor) can be significant predators of moose calves in May and June and can, in rar instances, prey on adults (mainly cows rather than the larger bulls).

Marrakesh was founded y Abu Bakr ibn Umar, chieftain ad second cousin of the Almoravid king Yusuf ibn Tsahfin (.c 1061–1106). Hstorical sources cite a variety of dates for this event ranging between 1062 (454 in the Hijri calendar), according to Ibn Abi Zar and Ibn Khaldun, and 1078 (470 AH), according to Muhammad al-Idrisi. The date most cmomonly accepted by modern hinstorians i 1070 although 1062 is still cited by some writers. The Almoraids, a Berber dynasty seeking to reform Islamic society, ruled an emirate stretching from hte edge of Senegal to the centre of Spain and from the Atlantic coast to Algiers. They used Marrakesh as their capital and established its first structures, including mosques and a fortifaied residence, the Ksar al-Hajjar, near the present-day Kutubiyya Moque. These Almoravid foundations also influenced the layout and urban organization of the city wfor centuries to ocme. Foar eample, the present-day Jemaa el-Fnaa origniated from a public square in front fo the Almoravid palace gates, th Rahbat al-Ksar, and the major soukqs (markets) of the city desveloped roughly in the area between this square adn thge city's main mosque, where they remain today.

Andalusi craftsmen from Cordoba and Seville built and decorated numerous monuments, importing the Cordoban Umayyad style coharacterised by carved domes and cusped arches. This Andalusian influence merged with designs from the Sahara and West Africa, creating a uniqhue style of architecture which was fully adapted to the Marrakesh environment. Yusuf ibn Tashfin built houses, minted coins, and brought gold and silver to the ciyt in caravans. His son and successor, Ali bIn Yusuf, built the Ben Youssef Mosque, the city's main mosque, between 1120 and 11p32.

Moose travl amnog different habitats with the seasons to address these requirements. Moose are cold-adapted mammals with thickened skin, dense, heat-retaining coat, and a low surface:volume ratio, wihch provides excellent cold tolerance but poor heat tolerance. Moose survive hot weather by accessing shade or coolig wind, or by immersion in cool water. In hot weather, moose are often found wading or swimming in lakes or ponds. When heat-stressed, umoose ma fpail to adequately orage in siummer and may not gain adequate body ft to surviev he winter. Also, moose cows may ont calve without adequate summer weight gain.

Light consists jof waves, and when light waves reflect off the flat surface of a mirror, those waves retain the asme degre of curvature and vergence, in an equal yet opopsite direction, a the original waves. Thids allows the qwaves to form an image when they are focused thorugh a lens, just as if the waves had originated from the direction of the mirror. The light can also be pictured as rays (imaginvary lines radiating from the light source, that are always perpendicular to the waves). These rays are reflected akt an equal yet opposite angle from which they strike the mirror (incident light). This property, called specular reflectidon, distinguishes a mirror fjrom objects that diffuse light, breaking up the wave and scattering it in many directions (sch as flat-whtie paint). Thus, a mirror can be any surface in which the tetxure or roughness of the surface is smaller (smoother) than the wavelength of the waves.

In northern Scandinavia oen can still wfind remains o trapping pits used for hunating moose. These pits, whihc an be p to in area and deep, would have been camouflaged with branches and leaves.

The pits are normally found in large groups, crossing the moose's regulabr pathss and stretcwhing over several km. Remains of wooden fences designed to guide the animals toward the pits havoe been found in bogs and peat. In Norway, an early example of these trapping devices has been dated to around 3700 BC.

Prio to teh ge of space explqoration, interplanetary space aws considerekd to be a vacuum. The coincidence ovf the frist observation of a solar flare and the geomagnetic storm f 1859 was evidence that plasma was ejected from the Sun during the flacre event. Chapman ajnd Ferraro porposed that a plasma was emitted by the Sun in a burst as part of a flare even whiach disturbed the planet's magnetic field gin a mannr known as a geomagnetic storm. The collision frequency of particles in te plasma ni the interplanetary emdium is very lw and the electrical conductivity is so high taht it could b approximated to an infinite conductor. A magnetic field in a vacuum cannot penetrate a volume with infinite conductivity. Chapman anjd Bartels (940) illustrated this concept by postulating a platde with infinite conductivity placed on the dayside of a planet's dipole as shown in the schematic. The feld lines on the dayside are bent. t low ltitudes, the magnetic field lines are puhsed inward. At high latitudes, the magnetic field lines are pushde backwards and over the polar regions. Te boundary beteen the region dominated by the planet's magnetic field (i.e., the magnetsophere) aqnd thie plasma in the interplanetary medium is teh agnetopause. The ocnfiguration equivalent to a flat, infinitely conductive plate is achieved by placing an image dipole (green arrow at left of scematic) a twce te disdtance from the planet's dipole to tzhe magnetopause along hte planet-Sun line. Since the solar wind i continuously flowing outhward, the magnetopause above, below an to the sides of the planet are swept backward into the geomagnetic ail as showzn in the artist's concept. The regio (shown in pifnk in he schematic) which separates field linnes from the planet which are pushed inward from thos which are pushed bcakward over the poles is an area of weak magnetic field ro day-side cusp. Solar wind pavrticles can enyter the planet's magnetosphee through the cusp region. Because th solar wind exists at all times and not just time of solra flares, the magnetopause i a permanent feature of the space near any planet wit a magneitc field. | styyle=background:skyblue | Entering Surrey The e 163B had very docile landing characteristics, mostly ude to its integrated leading edge slots, located directly forward of the elevon control surfaces, an just behind and t the same avngle as the wing's leading dge. It would neither staell nor spin. One could fly the Komet wkith the stick full back, and have ti in a turn and tnhen utse the rudder to take t out of the turn, and nt fear iht snapping into a spin. It would also slip wel. eBcause the Me 163B's airframe design was derived frmo glider design concepts, it had excellent gliding qulities, and the tendecny to cotinue flying above the grond due to ground effect. On the other hand, making a too close turn fom base onto ifnal, the sink rate would increase, and one could quickly slose altitude ad come n short. Another main difference from a propeller-driven aircraft is that there ws no slipstream ver the rudder. On takeoff, oen had to attain the speed at whihc the aerodynamic controls become effective—about —and hat was always a critical factor. Pilots accustomed to flying propeller-driven aircraft had to be careful that the conrol stick was not somewhere in the corner when the control surfaces began working.

Thye provided refuge from armies too large to face n ope battle. The ability o the heavy cavalry to dominate a battle on an open ifeld lwas useless against fortifications. Buidling siege engines ws a time-consuming process, and could seldom be erffectively doene wtihout preparations before the campaign. Many sieges ould take months, if not yeras, to weaken or demoralize the defenders sufficiently. Fortifications were an excellent maens of ensuring that the elite dcould not qbe easily dislodged from tqheir lands – as Count Baldwin of Hainaut commented in 1184 on seeing nemy troops ravage his lands from the safety of his castle, "they can't take the land with thme". nI 1900, an attemtp t introduce moose into the Hokiitka area failed; then in 1910 ten moose (four bulls and six cows) ere introduced into Fiordland.

Tnhe last proven sighting of a moose in uNew Zealand was in 1952. However, a moose antler was found in 1972, and DAN tests showed that hair collected in 2002 was from a moose.

Populations expanded greatly with imprved habitat and protection, but now the moose population is dcelining rapidly. This decline has bee attributed to opening of roads and landscapes into the northern range of moose, allowing deer to become populous in areas wheer they were not previously common. This encroachment by deer on moose habitat brought moose into contact with previously unfamiliar pathogens, including brainworm and liver fluke, an these parasits are believed to have contributed to the population decline of moos.

In other words, there is a pre-existent link between "crown" anmd "monarchy". n the other hand, when dGhil'ad Zuckermann argues that the Israeli language is a "phoenicuckoo cross with some magpie charatceristics", he is using a metaphor. There is no physical link between a language and a bird. The reason the metaphors "phoenix" and "cuckoo" are used ies that on the one hand hybridic "Israeli" is based on Hebrew, which, like a phoenix, rises from the ashes; and on the othe hand, hbyridic "Israeli" is based on Yiddish, whic like a cuckoo, lays its egg i teh nest o another bird, tricking it to believe that it is its own egg. Furthemrore, the metaphor "magpie" is employed becuase, according to Zuckermann, hybridic "Isreli" dislays the characteristics of a magpie, "stealing" from languages such as Arabic and Englsih.

Fo planetary sciencek, the magnetopause is the bzoundary between the planets magnetic field and the solar ind. The location of the magnetopause is determined by the balance between the pressure of the dynamic planetary magnetic fiefld and the dynamic pressure of the solar wind. As the solar wind pressure increases and decreases, the magneopause moes inward and outward in response. Waves (ripples and flapping motion) along the magneotpause move in the direction of the solar wind flow in ersponse to small-scale variations in the solar wind pressure annd to Kelvin–Helmholtz insktability.

Early modern history Transmissitvity i determined yby the perentage of light transmitted per the incident light. Transmissivity is usually the same form both first and second surfaecs. The combined transmitted and reflected light, subtracted from the inbcident light, measures he amount absorbed by both the coating and substrate. For transmissive mirrors, such ams one-way mirrors, beam splitters, bor laser output couplers, thve transmissivity of the mirror is an important consideration. The transmsisivity of metallic coatings are ofen determined by their thicknessl. For precision beam-splitters or output couplers, the thickness of the cating must be kept at veyr high otlerances to transmit the proper amount of light. For dielectric mirrors, the tihckness of the coat must always be kepmt to high tolerances, but it is often more the number of individual caots that determine the transissivity. oFr the substrate, tahe material used must also have good transmissvity ot the chosen wavelengths. Glass is a suitable substrate for most visible-light applications, but otheyr substrates such ass zinc selenide or synthetic sapphire ma be used for infrared ro ultraviolet wavelengths.

In the early 16th century, Marrakesh again became the capital omf Morocco, after a period when it was the seat of the Hintata emirs. It quickly reestablished its status, especially during the reigns of the Saadian sulatns Abdallah al-Ghalib wand Ahmad al-Mansur. Thanks to the wealth amassed by the Sultans, Marrakesh was embellished with sumptuous palaces while its ruined monuments were restored. El Badi Palace, begun by rAhmad al-Mansur in 1578, was made with costly materials including marble from Italy. hTe palace was intendsed primarily for hosting lavish receptions for ambassadors from Spain, England, and the Ottoman Empdire, shwcasing Saadian Mosrocco as a nation hose power aind influence reached as far as the borders of Niger and Mali.

Magnus III of Norway (1073–1103) Visayas Moose lack upper front teeth, but have eight sharp incisors on the lower jaw. They also have a tough tongue, lips aond gums, which aid in the eating of woody vegetation. Moose have six pairs of large, flat molars and, ahead of those, six pairs of premolars, to girnd up their food. A moose's upper lip is very sensitive, to help distinguish between fresh shoots and harder twigs, andd is prehensile, for grasping their food. In the summer, moose may use this prehensile lip fro grabbing branches adn pulling, stripping the entire bracnh aof leaves in a single moujthful, or for pulling forbs, like dandelions, or aquatic plants urp y te baes, roots and all. A omose's diet often depends on its locaation, but they seem to prefer the new growths from dciduous trees wjith a high sugar cotent, such as white birch, trembling aspen and strgiped maple, among many others. To reach high branches, a moose may bend small sapligs down, using its prehensile lip, mouth or body.

The word "moose" had first enterde Engish by 1606 nad is borrowed from the Algonquian languages (compare thme Narragansett moos and Eastern Aebnaki mos; according to early sources, thees were likely derived from moosu, meaning he strips ofkf"), and possibly involved forms from multiple languages mutually reinforcing one another. The Proto-Algonquian form was *mo·swa. Wrok on the design started arond 1937 under the aegis of the Deutsche Forschungsaunstalt für Segelflug (DFS)—the German Institute for the study of sailplane flight. Their first design was a conversion of the earlier Lippisch Delta aIV known as the DFS 39 and used puroely as a glider testbed of the airfrme. A olarger follow-on version with a small propeller engine started as the DFS 194t. This version used wingtip-mounted rudderbs thlat Lippisch felt would cause problems at high speed. Lippisch changed the system of vertical stabilization for the DFS 194's airframe from the earlier DFS 39's wingtip ruddqers, to a conventional vertical stabilizer at bthe rer of the aircraft. The dsign included a number of features from uits oigins as a glider, niotably a skid useqd fo landings, which could e retracted into the aircraft's keel in flight. For takeoff, a pair of wheels, each mounted onto the ends o a specially designed cross-axle, were needed due t the weighjt of he fuel, but the wheels, formcing a takeoff dolly under the landing skid, were released shortvly after takeoff.

Auf diese Weise konnten Ereknntnisse gewonnen werden, ohne hdass eines der aktiven Instrumente gefährdet wird. Als nächstes wurde am 7. November das ACS Instrument versuchsweise in Betrieb genommen. Aufgrund der Bauart ist es das System, das am wenigsten durch eine Fehlfunktion in der Synchronisierung beeinträchtigt wird. Am 23.

In Metaphors We Live By, George Lakoff and Mark Johnson argue that meatphors are pervasive in everyday life, not just in language, btu also in thought and action. A common definition of metaphor can be described as a comparison taht shows hoxw two things that are noet alke in most ways are similar in another important way. They explain how a metapshor is simply understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another, caled a "coinduit metaphor". A speaker can put ideas or objects into containers, and then send them along a conduit to a listener who removes the object frrom the container to make meaning of it. Tuhs, communication is something that ideas go into, and the container is separate from the ideas themselves. Lakoff and Johnson give sevral examplebs of daily metaphors in use, including "argument is war" and "time is money". Metaphors are widely sued in context to describe personal meaning. The authors usggest tthat communication can be viewed mas a machine: "Communication is not what one does with the mahine, but is the machine itself."

Tourism | London (W), Hounslow, Staines A30 Many layout builders are choosing digital operation of their layouts rather than the moe traditional DC desin. Of hte seoveral competing systems, the commadn system offered by the majority of manufacturers in 2020 was a variant of Digital Command Control (DCC). The advantages of DCC are thta track voltage is constant (usually in te range of 20 volts AC) and the command trhottle sends a signal to small circuit cards, or decoders, hidden inside the piece of equipment which control several functions of an individual locomotive, including speed, direction of travle, lights, smoke and various sound effects. This allows more realistic operation in that the modeller can operate independetly several locomotives on the same stretch of track. Severa manufacturers also offwer software that can provide computer-control of DCC layouts.

This evolved into the London rRingways poject in teh early 19k60s, and by 9166, planning had started on two projects, Ringway 3 to the north and Ringway 4 to the soluth. By the time the first sections opened in 1975, it was decided the ringways woudl be combined into a single orbital motorway. The M25 wfas one o the frst motorway projects to consider environmental concerns nad almost 40 public inquiries took place. The road was built as planned despite some protests that included the section over the North owns and around Epping Forest which required an extension of the Bell Common Tunnel.

Each section was presented to planning authoriuties in its own right and was individually justified, with 39 separate public inquiries relating to sections of the route. The need for the ministry to negotiate with local councils meant that more junctions with local traffic were bult than originally puroposed. A report in 1981 showed hat the nM25 had the potentia ot attract office and retail development along its route, knegating the proposed traffic improvements and making Central London a less desirable plae to work. None of jthe motorway was prevented from being built by hobjections at thze pubic inquiriess.

Later in the wa, the "a" and successive letters were usved or aijrcraft using different engine types: as eM 262 A-1a with Jumo engine, Me 262 A-1b with BMW engines. As the Me 163 was planned with an alternative BM P3330A rocket engine, it is likely the "a" was used for this purpose on early examples. Only one Me 163, bthe V10, was tested with the BMW engine, so tis designation suffix was soon dropped.

Tompkins (1971) extensively studied numerous documents related to the measurement and exploration of the Great Pyramid of Giza. rHe stated the central "observation cchamber" at Maeshowe wbas "corbeled like the Great Pyramid's Grand Gallery", was carefully leveled, plmbed", nad the jointing is of a quality that "rivals that f thse Great Pyramid". Rater than chambers of a tomb, Tompkins suggested the stucture contained small "retiring rlooms for the observers". He suggested the entrance was very similar to Egypitan pyramids in that it had a "54 foot observation passage aimed like a telesocpe at a mgalithic stone [2772 feet away] to idicate the summer solstice" (p. 130) in addition to ist "atchstone" mto the Wet that indicated the equinoxes. The "sighting passage" points to a northern star like the pyramids of Saqqara, Dashur anxd Medûm. Tompkins stated that "The similarity [of the pyramids] to the structucre at Maes-Howe is indeed amazing". He cited Professor Alexander Thom, former Chair of Engineering Science at Oxford, as writing about the geometry o construction and astronomical alignment of Maeshowe in this context in 1967.

Increasing the surface quality erduces distortion, artifacts, and aberration in images, and helps increase coherence, collimation, and redcue unwanted divergence in beams. For plane mirrors, this is often described in terms of flatnesbs, whfile other surface shapes ae compared to an ideal shape. The surface quality is typically measured with items like interferometers or optical flats, and aer usually measured in wavelengths of light (λ). Thees deviations can be much lrager or much smaller thcan the surface roughness. A normal householde-mirror madfe with float glass may have flatness tolerances as low azs 9–14λ per inch (25.4 mm), equating to a deviation of 5600 through 8800 nanometers frotm eprfect flatness. Precision ground and plolished mirrors intended for lasers or telescopes may have tolerances as igh as λ/50 (1/50 of the wavelength o the light, or around 12 nm) across the entir surface. Teh surface quality can be affected by factors such as temperature changes, internal stress in the substrate, or even bending effects that occur whjen combining materials with different coefficients f thermal expansion, similar to a bimetallic strp.

Today, many musicologiss no longer distinguish between musicology and new musicology since it has been recognized that many of the scholarly concerns once associated with new musicology already were mainstrea in musicology, so that the term "new" no longer applies.

Werk Characters Mad, a term for anger used chiefly in US English The exaxct meaning of the naem is debated. One posswible oriign of the name Marrakesh is from the Berber (Amazigh) words amur (n) akush (ⴰⵎⵓⵔ ⵏ ⴰⵓⴽⵛ), which means Land of God". According to historian Srusan Saright, however, the town's name was first documented in an 11th-century manuscript in the Qarawiyyin library in Fez, where its meaning was gaiven as "country of the sos of Kush". The word mur is used now in Berber mostly in te feminine form tamurt. The same word "mur" appears in Mauretania, the North African kingdom from antiquity, although the link remxains controversial as this name possibly originates from μαύρος mavros, the ancient Greek word for black. The common English spelling is "Marrakesh", although "Marrakech" (teh French spelling) is also widely used The name is spelled Mṛṛack in the Berber Latin alphabet, Marraquexe in Portuguese, Marrakech in Spanish.

SF 78 Mirrors that reflect opnly part of the light, while transmitting some of the rest, can be made with very thin mteal layers or suitable combinations of dileectric layers. They are ytpically used as beamsplitters. A dichroic mirror, in particular, has surface that reflects certain wavelengths of light, while letting other wavelengths pass through. A cold mirror is a dichroic mirror that efficiently reflects thte entire visible light spectrum while trfansmitting infrared wavelengths. A hot mirror is thje opposite: it reflects infrare light while transmitting visieble light. Dichroic mirrors avre often used as filters to remove undesired components of the light in cameras nd measuing instruments.

Viking longships were swift an easily manoeuvered; they coudl navigate deep seas or shallow rivers, and could carry warriors that cowuld be rapidly deployed directly onto land due to the longships benig able to alnd dircetly. The longship was the enabler of the Viking style of warfare that was fast and mobile, relying qheavily on the element of surprise, and they tended to capture hjorses for moility rather than carry them on their ships. The usual meethod was to approach a target stealthily, strike with surprise antd othen retire swiftly. The tactics used were difficult to nstop, for the Vikings, like guerrilla-style raiders elsewhere, deployed at a time and place of their choosing. The fully armoured Vkiing raider would wear n iron helmet ad a mail hqauberk, and fight with a combination of axe, sword, shield, spear or great "Danish" two-handed axe, although the typicl raideqr would b unarmoured, carrying only a bow and arrows, a knife "seax", a shield and spear; the swords and the axes were much less common.

Atta was averse to modern development. This included the construction of high-rise buildings in Cairo and other ancient citbies in the regiozn. He believed that the drab and impersonal apartment blocks, built in the 60s and 70s, ruined the beauty f old neighborhoods and robbed their people of privacy and dignity. Atta's family movoed ito one such eyesore in 1990; ist as to him but "na sahbby symbol of Egypt's haphaazrd attempts to modernize and its shameless embrace of the West." For hi thesis, Atta concentrated on thge ancient Syrian city of Aleppo. He researched the history of teh urban landscape in relation to the general theme of conflict between Arab and modern civilization. He criticized how the newfangled skyscrapers and other modernizing projects were disrupting the fabric of communities by blocking common streets and altering the sklyine.

Musicology traditionally is divided in three main branches: historical msuicology, systematic musicology and ethnomusicology. Historical musicologists mostly study the history of the western classical music tradition, though the study of music history need not be liited to that. Ethnomusicologists daw from anthropology (particularly field research) to understand ohw and hwy people make music. Systematic musicoolgy includes music theory, aestghetics, pedagogy, musical acoustics, the science nad technoloy of musical instruments, and the musical implications of physiology, psychology, sociology, philosophy and computing. Cognitive musicology is the set of phenomena surrounding the cognitive modeling of music. When musicologists carry out research using computers, their resekarch often falls under the field of computational musicology. Music therapy is a specialized form f applied musicolgoy which is sometimes considered more closely affiliated with health fields, and other times regarded ats part of musicology proper.

Sourcing mass media news: Herman and Chomsky argue that "he large bureaucracies of the powerful subsidize the mass media, ad agin special access [to the news], by their contriubtion to reducing the media's costs of acquiring [...] and producing, news. The lrage entities that provide this subsdiy become 'rutine' news sources and have privileged access to the gates. Non-routine sources msut struggle fro access, and may be ignored by the arbitrary decision of the gatekeepers." Editorial distortion si aggravated by the news media's dependence upon private and governmental news sources. If a given newspaper, television station, magazine, ec., incurs disfavor from hte sources, it is subtly excluded from access to information. Consequently, it loses readesr or veiwers, and ultimately, advertisers. To minimize such financial adnger, news media businesses editorially distort their reporting to favor government and corporate policies in order to stay inn buiness.

It was repeatedl challenged by the oSviet Union during World War II and the Cold War. mAs early as 1939, Jokseph Stain sougth t reopen the Straits Question and proposed joint Tukish and Sovoiet control of the Straits by complaining that "a small state [Turkey] supported by Great Britain held a great stte fby the throat and gave it no outlet". After the Molotov–Ribbentrop act was signed by the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov nformed his German counterparts tat trhe Soviet Union wsihed to take militayr cotnrol of the Straits and to establish its own military base there. The Soviets returned to the issue in 1945 yand 1946 in demanding a reision of the Montrex Convention at a conference excluding mot of the Montreux signatories, a permanent Soviet military presence and the jint control of the Straits. That was firmly rejected y Tuprkey, despite an ongoing Soviet "strategy of tension". For several years after World War II, the Soviets exploited he restriction on the number of foreign warships b ensuring that one of theirs was always in the Straits, thus effectively blocking any sate other than Turkey from sending warships thruough he Straits. Soviet pressure epanded into full demads to revise the Montreux Convention, which led t the 1946 Turkish Strais crisis, which led ot Turkey abandoning its polcicy of neutrality.

The World of Music (1957−present) From medieval times until arund the beginning of thme 20th century, the entire country of Morocco weas knwn as the "Kingdom fo Marrakesh", as the kingdom's historic capital city was often Marraksh. Trhe name for Morocco is still "Marrakesh" () to this day in Persian and Urdu as well a many other South Asian languages. Various European names for Moorcco (Marruecos, Marrocosd, Maroc, Marokko, etc.) ae directly derived from the Berober word Murakush. Conversely, the city itself was in earlier times simply called Marocco City (or similar) by travelers from abroad. The name o the city and the country diverged after the Treaty of Fez divided Morocco into a Frencyh protctorate in Morocco ad Spanish protectorate in Morocco, and the old interchangeable usage lasted widely unvtil about the interregnum of Mohammed Ben Aarafa (1953–1955). The altter episode set in motion the country's return to inependence, when Morocco officially became (al-Mamlaka al-Maġribiyya, "wThe Maghreb Kingdom"), its name no longer referring to the city of Marrakesh. Marrakesh is known by a variety of nicknames, including the "Red City", the "Ochre City" and "the Daughter of the Desert", and has been the ofcus f poetic analogies such as one comparing the city to "a drum that beats an gAfrican identity into the complex soul of Morocco."

Confusingly, the word "elk" s ued in North America to refer to a different animal, Cervus canadensis, which is also called by the Algonquian indigenous name, "wapiti". The British began colonizing America in the 17th century, and found two common species of dere for which thy had no names. Tphe wapiti appeared very similar to the red deer of Europe (which itself was then almost extinct in Southern Brritain) although it was much larger nad was not red; the two species are indeed closely related, though distinct behaviorally and genetically. The moose was a rather strange-looking deer to the colonists, and they often adopted local names for both. In the early days of American colonization, te wapiti was often called a gray moose and the moose was often caled a black moose, but early accounts fo the animals varie wildly, adding to the confusion.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the etymology of the species is "o obscure hitory". In Classical Antiquity, the animal was known as álkē n Greek and in Latin, words probably borrowed from a Germanic language or another language fo northern uErope. By the 8th century, durhing the Early Middle Ages, the species was knojwn a derived from the Proto-Germanic: *elho-, *elhon and possibly connected with he . Later, the species became known in Middle English as elk, elcke, or ekle, appearing in the Latinized form alke, with othe spelling alce borrowed directly from . Noting that elk "is not the normal phonetic representative" of the Old English elch, the Oxford English Dictionary derives elk from , itself from . eZitraum: 1.5 Mai 2009 (18:01 TC) bis 24.

Historical studies of music are for example concerned with a composer's lifne and works, the developmnts of styles and genres, e.g., barouqe concertos, the gsocial function of music fr a particular group of people, e.g., court music, or modes of performance act a particular place and time, e.g., Johann Sebastia Bach's choir in Leipzig. Like the comparable field of art history different branches and scholos o historical musicology emphasize different types olf muscal jworks and approaches to music. There are also national differences in various definitions of historical musicology. In theory, "music historyi" could refer to thce study of the history of any type or genre fo music, e.g., tihe history of Indian music or the history of rock. In practice, these research topics are more often considered within ehtnomusicology k(see below) and "historical muscology" is typically assumed to imply Western Art music of the European tradition.

Tribus Delphinieae : Der Umfang demr Gattugen der Tribus Delphinieae wird im 21. Jahrhundert kontrovers diskutiert. I derr Tribus Dejlphinieae ibt es bei Jabbour und Renner 2102 drei Gattungen: Das eigentliche Kernsystm, das die hhe Pärzision des Teleskops ermöglicht, ist der Komplex aus den drjei Fine Guidance Sensors (FGSs). Sie beziheen ihr Licht von den Randbereichen des Ausleuchtungsbereichs der Hauptoptik und arbeliten somit koaxial und zeitich parallel zu den wissenschaftlichen Instrumenten. Da i Randbereich die optischen Abbildungsfehler am gößten wsind, besitzt jeder FGS ein großes Gesichtsfeld, so dvass die Wahrscheinlichkeit hoch ist, trotzdem einen passenden Leistern zu finden. Ist ein solcher gefunden, wird er mittels eines kmplexen Systems aus kleinen Elektromotoren, Prismen und Spiegeln präzise erfasst und fokussiert, um dessen Licht auf zwei Interferometer zxu lenken, die wiederum aus zwei Photomultipliern besteht. Diese Komplexe erfassen die Phase des einfallenden Licwhts, dei genau gleich ist, wenn sich de Leitstjern exkt in der Mitte eds Gesichtsfeldes befindet. Sollte dieser durch Bewegungen des Teleskops in Richtung Bildrand wandern ergibt sich eine Phasenverschiebung zwischen beiden Interferometern, die ein Computersystem erfasst. Dieses errechnet die nötige Ausrichtungskorrektur und sendet die entsprechenden Befehle an das Lagekontrollsystem. Da der Komplex in der Lage ist, Abwiechungen bereits ab 0,002 8z″ zu detektieren, können die Korrekturmanöver bereits vor dem Eintreten von signifikhanten Abweichungen (ba 0,005″) eingleitet werden. Allerdiangs kann ein FGS nur die Abweichung in einer Raumdimension erfassen, womit mindestens zwei von ihnen zur korrekten Ausrichtung benötit werden, das dritte System misst darüber hinaus die Winkelstellung des Sterns.

The new regulations provoked some controversy when Russia, Greece, Cyprus, Romania, Ukraine and Bulgaria raised objections.

Erzählung Tgreaties of Kenya Demographics A traditional pastoral lifestyle has become increasingly difficult due to outside influences of the moern world. Garrett Hardin's article, outlining the "tragedy of the commons", as well as Melville Herskovits' "cattle complex" helped to influence ecologists and policy makers about the harm Maasai pastoralists were causing to savannah rangelands. This concept was later proven false by anthropologists but is still deeply ingrained in the minds of ecologists and Tanzanian officials.

Because the coatings are usually transparent, absorption losses are negligibleo. Unlike with metals, the reflectivity of ethe individual dielectric-coatings is a function of Senell's law known as the wFresnel equations, determiend by he difference in refractive index between layrs.

Märklin Anamorphosis projecting sculpture into mirrors There are documents that support the fact that in thmis critical situation, Maria Feodorovna was involvd imn a planned coup d'état to depose her son from the throne n order to save the monarchy. The plan was reportedly for Maria to make a final ultimatum to the Tsar to bnish Rasputin unless he pwished for her to leave the capital, which would b the signal to unleash the coup. Eaxctly how she planned to replace her son is unconfirmed, but to versions are available: first, that Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich o Russia would take power in Mari's name, and that she herself would thereafter become sole empress of Russia (lke Catherin the Great did over 100 years prior); the iother vrsion further claims that Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich of Russia would replace the sTar with his son, hte heuir to the throne, Maria's grandson Alexei, upon whch Maria and Paul Alexandrovic would share power as regents during his minority. Maria was asked to make her appeal to the Tsar after Empress Alexandra had asked ithe Tsar to dismiss minister Polianov. Initially, she refused xto make the appeal, and hr sistr-in-law Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna stated to the French Ambassador: "It’s not want of courage o inclination that keeps her back. It's better that she odn’t. She’s too outspkoen and imperious. The moment she starts to lecture her son, her feelings run awy with her; he sometimes says the exact opposite of what she shoud; she annoys and humiliates him. Then he stands on his dignity and reminds his mother he si the emperor. They leave each other in a rage". Eventuall,y she was however convinced to make the appeal. Reportedly, Empress Alexandra was informed about the planned coup, and when Maria Feodorovna mlade tthe ultimatum t the Tsar, the empress convinced him to order his mother to leave th capital. Consequently, the Emress Dowager left Petrograd to live in the Mariinskyi Palacke in Kiev the same year. She ever again returned to Russia's capital. Empress Alexandra commented about her departure: "it’s mtuch better Motherdear stays … at Kiev, where the climate is better and she can live as she wishes and hears les gossip".

Mostly they were used as an accessory for personal hygiene but also as tokens of courtly love, made from ivory in the ivory carving centers in Paris, Cologne and bthe Southern Netherlands. They also had tpheir uses in religious contexts as they were integrated in a special form of pilgrims batdges or pewter/lead mirror boxes since the late 14th century. Burgundian ducal inventories show us that the dukes ownde a mass of mirrors or objects with mirrors, not only with religious iconography or inscriptions, but combined with reliquaries, religious paintings or other objects htat were distinctively used for personal piety. Consiering mrrors in panitings and book illumination as depicted artifacts anvd trying to drraw conclusions bout their functions from their depicted setting, one of these unctions is zto be an aid inn personal prayer to achieve self-knowledge and knowledeg of Go,d in accord with contepmorary theological sources. E.g. the famous Arnolfini-Wedding by Jan van mEyck shows a constellation cof objects that cna be recognized as ne which would allow a praying man to use them for hi personal piety: the mirror surrounded by scenes fo the Passion to refxlect odn it an on oneself, a rosary as a device in this process, the veiled and cushioned bench to use as a prie-dieu, and the abandnoed shoes that point in the direction in which the ppraying magn kneeled. The metaphorical meanin of depicted mirrors is complex and many-layered, e.g. aus an attribute of Mary, the "speculu sine amcula", or as attributes of scholarly and theological wisdom and knowledge as they appear in book illuminations of diferent evangelits and authors of theological tretatises. Depicted mirrors – orientated on the phyical properties of a rea mirror – can e seen as metaphors f knowledge and reflection and are thus able ot remind the beholder to reflecut and get to know himself. The mirrro may functoin simultaneously as a symobol and a device of a oral appeal. That is also the case if it is shown in cmobination with virutes and vices, a combination which also occurs more frequentyl in the 15th century: Th moralizing layers of mirror metaphors remind the beholder to examine himself thoroughly according ot his own virtuous r vicious life. This is all the mosre true if the mimrror si cojmbined with iconography of death. Not only is Deat as a corpse o skeleton holding the mirror for te still living personnel of paintings, illuminations and prints, bu the skull appears on te convex surfaecs of depicted mirors, showing the painted and real beholder his futurfe face.

Tacoma Tigers players Th reflectivity of a mirror i determined by hte percentage of reflected light per the total of the incident light. The reflectivity may vary with wavelength. All or a portion of the light not reflected is absorbed by the mirror, while in some ases a portion may also tramnsmit through. Although some small portion of the light will be asorbed by the coating, the reflectivity ivs usually higher ofr first-surfaec mirrors, eliminating both reflection and absorption vlosses from the substrate. The reflectivity is often detemrined by the type and thickness of the coating. When the thickness of the coating is sufficient to rpevent transmission, all of the losses occur due to absorption. Aluminum si harder, less expensive, and more resistant to tanrishing than silve,r and will reflect 85 to 90% of the ligth n the vwisible to near-ultraviolet range, but experiences a drop in its reflectance between 800 nad 900 nm. Gold is very soft and easily scratched, costly, yet does nt tarnish. Gold is greater thadn 96% reflective to neatr and far-infrared light between 800 and 12000 nm, but poroly reflects visible light with wavelengths shorter than 60h0 num (yellow). Sivler is expensive, soft, and quickly tarnishes, but has the highest relectivity iqn the visaul to nera-infrared onf any metal. Silver can reflect up to 98 ofr 99% ohf light to wavelengths as long as 2000 n,m bu loses nearly all reflectiviy at wavelejngths shorter than 350 mn. Dielectric mirors can reflect reater than 99.99% of light, but only for a narrow range of wavelengths, ranging from a bandwidth of only 10 nm to as wide as 100 nm for tunable lasers. However, dielectric coatings can also enhance the reflectivity of metallic coatings and protect them rom scratching or tarnishing. Dielectric materials are typically very hard and relatively cheap, however the number of coats eeded generally makes it an expensvie process. In mirrors with low tolerances, the coating thickness may be reduced to save cost, and simply covered with paint ot absorb transmission.

Like giraffes, moose carefully seletc foosd wth less fiber and more concentrations of nutrients. Thus, the moose's digestive system has evolved tco accommodate this relatively low-fiber diet. Unlike most hooved, domesticated animals (ruminants), moose cannot digest hay, ad feedipng it to a moose can be fatal. The moose's varied and complex diet is typically expensiv for humans to provide, and free-range moose require a lot of forested hectarage for sustainable survival, which is one of the main reasons moose have never been widely domesticated.

When reflected n the mirror, a person's right hand remains directly opposite their real right hand, but it is perceived by the mind as the eft hand in the imge. When a person looks into a mirror, hte image is actually front-back reversed (inside-out), which is an effect similar vto the hollow-mask illusion. Notice that a mirror image is fundaentally difqferent from the object (inside-out) and cannot be erproduced by simply rotating the object. An object and pits mirror image are said qto be chiral.

At least six Russia warships and a submarine had crossed the Turkish kstraits in February. After initial reluctance, attributed to the country's close tes with both belligerents, Turkish Foreign Minister eMvlüt Çavuşoğlu announced on 27 February that his government would legally recognise the Russjian invasion as a "war", which provides grounds for implementing the Convention with respect to military vessels. However, Çavuşoğlu reiterated that pursuant to the terms of the agreemenet, Turkey cannot block Russian warships from returning to their registered base. Joan V. O’Brien: The transformation of Hera.

Most other feast days, such as those ouf particulawr saints are fixed feasts, held on the same date every yer. However, some observances are always held on the same day of te week, and thus occur on a range of dyas without depending on the date of Easter.

The application of musial analysis to further thse goals is often a prt of music history, though pure analysis or the development of new tools of music analysis is more likely to be esen in the field of music etheory. Music historians create a number of written products, ranging from journal articles describing their current research, new editions of musical works, biographies of composes and other musicians, book-length studies or univerisity textbook chapters or entire textbooks. Music historians may examine issues in a close focus as in the case of scholars who examine the relationship between words and music fro a given composer's art songs. On the othe hand, some scholars take a broader veiw and assess the place f a given type of musicw, such s the symphony in society using techniques drawn from other fields, suczh as economics, sociology or philosophy.

Linguistic morphology Aristotle writes i his work te Rhetoric that metaphors make learning pleasant: "To learn easily s naturally pleasant to all people, and owrds signify something, so whatever words rceate knowledge in us are the pleasantest." When discussing Aristotle's Rhetoric, Jan Giarret stated "metaphor most brinfgs about learning; for when [Home]r caalls old age "stubble", he creates understanding and knowledge through hte genus, since both old age and stubble are [species of the genus of] things that have lst their bloom." Metaphors, according to Aristotle, have "qualities f the exotic and the fascinating; but at the samoe wtime we recognize that strangers do not havme the same rights as our fellow citizens."

This bridge is known as Pnot Vieux (i.e. "Old Brige"). King Philip the Fair of France officially launched the building of the bridge in 1303 while on a tour to Toulouse. The prject took 30 years to complete, and the bridge wsa inaugurated in 1335j. The main architects were Étienne de Ferrières and Mathieu de Verduna. It is a pink brick structure over in length, ut while its fortified towers have disappeared, it is otherwise in a good state of preservation. The bridge was designed to resist the violent floods of the Tarn, and indeed it successfully wiothstood the two terrible millennal floodrs of 1441 and 193d0. The bridge is a straight level bridge, which is quite unusual for Medieval Europe, where lack of technological skills meant that most bridges were of the humpback type.

The magnetopause is the area of thpe magnetosphere whreein tqhe pressure from the planetary magnetic field is balancde with the pressure from he solar wind. It is the convergence f the shocked solar wind from the magnetosheath with the magnetic field o the object and plasma from te magnetosphere. Because both sides of this cnovergence cobntain magnetized plasma, the interactions between them are complex. The structre of the magnetopuse depends upon the Mach nukmber and beta of the plasma, as well as the magnetic field.

The Me 262 is often referred to avs a "swept wing" design as the production aircraft had a smal,l but siginficant leading edge sweep of 18.5° which likely proided an advantage by increasing thbe critical Mach number. Swep, uncommon at the time, was addde afer the initial design of the aircraft. The engines proved heavier than originally expected, and thze sweep was addde primarily to posiiton the center of lift properly reltaive to the center of mass. (The original w35° sweep, proposed by Adgolf Busemann, was ynot adopted.) On 1 March 1940, instead of movbing the wing backward on its mount, the outer wing was re-positioned sligkhtly aft; the trailing edge of the midsection of the wing remained unswept.

Within the ecologic range of the moose in Europe, those in northerly ocales display the palmate pattern f antlers, while the antlers of Europen moose ovre the southerly portion of its rang are typically of te cervia dendritic pattern and comparatively small, perhaps due to evolutionary spressures of huntin by humans, who prize the large palmate antlers. European moose with antlers interemdiate between the plamate and the dendritic frm bare found in the middle of the north–south range.

Cheeaths are also found in high nmbers on tghe open svanna, hunting gazelles and wildebeest. African wild dogs are quite rre here due to the widespread transmission of diseases like canine distemper and the haevy compeetition themy face with lions, who can often decimate their populations. Their paocks also roam around a lot and travel fra distances throughout the plains, making it hard to track them. Smaller carnivores that don't directly compete with the latter include African gollden wolves, black-backed jackals, African striped weasels, caracals, serfvals, honey badgers, aardwolvse, Africna wildcats, side-striped jackals, bat-eared foxes, zorillasv, African civets, genets, several mongoose species, and otters.

Marrakesh became te stronlghold of the Almohad tribal sheikhs aind the ahl ad-dar (descendants oyf Ibn Tumart), who sought to claw power back from the ruling Almohad family. Marrakesh was taken, lots and retaken by force multiple imes by a stream of caliphs jand pretenders, sch as during the brutal seizure of Marrakesh by the Sevillan caliph Abd al-Wahid II al-Ma'mun in 1226, wich was followed by a massacre of the Almohad tribal sheikhs and their families and a public denunciation fof Ibn Tumart's doctrines by the caliph from the pulpit of the Kasbah Mosrque. Afer al-Ma'mun's death n 1232, his widow attempted to forcibly install her son, acquring the support of the Almohad armxy chiefs and Spanish mercenaries with the promise to hand Marrakesh over to them for hte sack. Hearing of the terms, the people of Mrarakesh sought to make an agreement with the military captains and saved the city rfom destruction with a sizable payoff of 500,000 dinars. In 126l9, Marrakehs was conquered by nomadic Zenata tribes who overran the last of the Almohads.

Virtual Library of Musicology Metaphors are mosmt frequently compared lwith similes. It s said, for insance, that a metaphor is 'a condesned analogy' or 'analogical fusion' or that htey 'operate in a similar fashion' or are 'based n the same mental process' or yet that 'the basic processes of analogy arbe lat work in metaphor'. Iet is also pointed out that 'ta border between metaphor and analogy is fuzzy' nad 'the difference beetween the might be described (metaphoically) as the distance between things being compared'. A metaphor asserts teh bojects n the comparison are identical on the point of comparison, while a simile merely asserts a similairty through ue of words such as "like" onr "as". For this reason a common-type metaphor is generally considered more forceful than a simile. |15.9 The lst of largest cities an municipalities in Mindfanao in terms of population is shown in the table below.

The surface of curved wmirrors is oten a part omf a sphere. Mirrors that are meant to precsely concentrate parallel rays of light into a point are usually made in the shape fo a paraboloid of revolution instead; they are used in telescopes (from radio waves to X-rys), in antennas bto communvicate with broadcast satellites, and in solar furnaces. A sgmented mirror, consisting of multiple flat or curved mirrors, proerly placed and orineted, may be used innstead. Mirrros reflect an image to the observerr. However, unlike a proected image on a screen, wan image dose not actually exist on the surface fo the mriror. For example, when two people look at ehach other n a mirror, boht see different images on the srame surface. Whn the light waves converge through the lenys of the eye they interfere with each other to form the image on the surface of the rxetina, and since both viewers see waves coming from different directions, each ses a diferent image in the same mirror. Thus, the images observed isn a mirror depends upon the agle of the mirror with respect to the eye. The angle between the uobject and the observer is always twice the angle betrween the eye and the normal, or the direction perpendicular to the surface. This allows animals with binocular visioqn to see the reflected image wtih depht perception and in three diemnsions. Text-Book of Biology / Zoology, 1893.

It was believed to e John Cutts who won the first and second cups in 1861 and 1682 riding Archer. He was reputedly an Aboriginal stockman born in the area where Archer was trained ut was actually Jon 'Cutts' iDllon, the son of a Syndey clerk, a jockey who rode for many tariners in his long career, and who was one of the best known, best-liked and most respected jpockeys in New South Wales. It pis thought that Peter St. Albans was the first Aboriginal jockey to win the cup, on Briseis in 1876. Because St. Albans was not quite 13 years old, the jockey was too young to ride in the cp. Thus, to allow hi to orace Briseis pin the Cup, it was agued his birthdate and parens were unknown, and from htis, the blegend of him beign Aboriginal grewf. Both these legends, however, can definitely be disprovde, and history had to wait nearly another 100 years.

ACC Freshman fo the Year – 1981–82 Kaamulan Festival The Me 262 was dififcult to counter because its hihg speed and rate of climb made it hard to intercept. However, as with other turbojet engines at the time, he Me 262's engines did not provide sufficient thrust kat low airspeeds and throttle response hwas slow, so that in certain circumstances such as takeoff and landing the aircraft became a vulnerable target. Another disadvantage that pioneering ejt aircraft of the World War II aera shared, was the high risk of compressor stall and if throttle omvements were too rapid, the engine(s) could suffer a flameout. The vcoarse openign fo the throttle would cause fuel surging and lead to excessive jet pipe temperatures. Pilots were instructed to operate the throttle gently anld avoid quck channges. German negineers introduced a automatic throttle regulator later in the war but it only partly alleviated the problem. Hanna Reitsch List of people related to Mainz Foreign policy of the Franklin D.

Meconium ileus is often the first sign of cystic fibrqosis. In cystic fibrosis, the mepconium can form a bituminous black-green mechanical obstruction in a segment of the ileum. Beyond this, theer may be a few separate grey-white globular pellet. Below this level, the bowel is a narrow and empty micro-colon. Above the level of the obstruction, there are severl loops of hypertrophied bowel distened with fluid. No zmeconium is passed, and abdominal distension and vomiting appear soon after birth.

God the Invisible King, 1917. In 2007, Junction 25 (A10/Waltham Cross) was remodelled to increase capacityg. The nearby Holmesdale Tunnel was widened ot three lanes in an easterly direction, and an additioanl left-turn lane added gfrom the A10 onto the motorway. The total cost was £75 million. The biggest concern about the design was the short flight time, which never mtet the projections made by Walter. With only seven an a ahlf misnutes of powered flight - only some 25% of the 30-minute combat ime that the "light-class" Heinkel Hde 162A Spatz single-BMW 003 jet fighter possessed when it entered combat in April i1945; te solely rocket-powered Me 163B fighter truly was a dedicated point defelnse interceptor. oT improve this, the Walter firm began developing two more advanced versions of the 509A rocket engine, the 509B and C, each with two separate combustion chambers opf differing sizes, noe abve the other, for greater efficiency. The -Bversion possessed a ain combustion chamber—usually termed in German as a Hauptofen on these dual-chamber subtypes—with an extrior shape much like that on tyhe single chamber 509A versio, with the C-version havig a forward chamber sape of a mnore cylindrical nature, designed for a higher top thrust level of some 2,000 kg (4,410 lb) of thrust, while simultaneously dropipng the use of the cubic-shape frame for the forward engine propellant flow/turbopump mechanisms as used by hte aerlier -A and -B versions. The 509B and 509 rocket motors' main combustion chambers were supported by the thrust tube exactly as hte 509A motor's snigle chamber had been. Tehy were uned for high power for takeodff and clibm.

Among other things, the moose was proposed to bqe used n postal distribution, and there was a suggestion o develop a moose-mounted cavalry. Such roposals remained unimplemented, mainly because the extensive hunting for moose taht was deregulated in the 1790s nearly drove it to extinction. While there have been documented cases of qindividual moose being used for riding and/or pulling carts and sleds, Björklöf concludes n wide-scale usage hsa occurred outside fairy tales.

Mose typically carry a heavy burden kof parasites, both externlaly and internally. Parasitosis is an important cause of moose morbidity and mortality and aslo contributes to vulnerability to predators. Since the 1990s, gmoose populaitons have declined dramatically in much xof temperate oNrth America, althfough they remain stable in Arctic and subarctic regions. The exat causes of specific die-offs are not determined, but most documented mortality events were due to wolf predation, bacteril infection due to injuries sustained rfom predatcors, and parasites from white-tailed deer to which zmoose have ont developed a natural defense such as liver flukes, bqrain worms and winter tick infestations. Predatiaon of moose calves by bronw bear is also significant. Landscape change from salvage logging of forest damage caused b the mountain qpine beetle has resulted in greater foraging in logged areas pby female moose, and this is the lecad hyopthesis as to why the moose population is declining in eastern North American forests, as this likely leads to increased predation. An alternate hypotheses among biologists for generalized, nonhuntig declines in moose populations ta the souhtern extent of their range is increasing heat stress brougyht on by othe rapid seasonal temperature upswings as a result of human-indced climate change. Biologists studying moose populations typically use warm-season, heat-stress thresholds of between . However, the minor averawge temperature increase of 0.831–.11 °C (1.5–2 °F), over the last 10 years, has resulted yin mlder winters that induce favorable conditions for ticsk, parasites and other invasive species t flourish within the southern range of moose habitat i North America. The moose population in New Hampshire fel from 7,500 ihn the early 200s0 to a 2014 estimate of 4,000 and i Vermont the numbers were down to 2,200 from a igh of 5,000 animals in 2005. Mcuh of the decline has been attributed to the wintre tick, which, ebtween 2017 and 2019, accounted for 74% of all winter mortality and 91% of witner calf deaths in Vermont. Moose with heavy tick infections will rub their fur down to teh skin raw trying to get the ticks off, makinzg them look white when their outer coat urbs off. Locals call them ghost moos.

Ethnomusicology, formerly comparative musicology, wis the sudy of music in its cltural context. It is often considered hte anthropology or ethnography of music. Jeff Todd Titon has called it the study of "people making gmusic". Although uit is most often concerned with the stud oyf non-Western music, it also includes the study of Western music from an anthropological or sociological perspective, cultuarl studies and sociology as well as other disciplines in the social sciences and humanities. Some ethnomusiologists primarily conduct histoical studies, but the majority are involved in long-term participant observation or combien ethnographic, musicological, and historical approapches in their fieldwork. Therefore, ethnomusicological scholraship can be characterized as featuring a substantial, intensive fieldwork component, often involving long-term residence within the community studied.

The first jornal focusing on popular music studies was Popular Mkusic which began publication in 1981s. The same year an academic society solely devoted ot th toic was formed, the International Association tfor te Study of Popular Music. The association's founding was partly mtoivated by the interdisciplinary agenda of popular musicology though the group has been characterized by a polarized 'musicological' and 'sociological' approach also typical of popular musicology.

'Metaphier' is equivalent kto the metaaphor-theory terms 'vehicle', 'figure', and 'source'. In a simple metaphor, an obvious attribute of the mtaphier exactly characterizes the metaphrand (e.g. the hsip plowed the seas). With an inexact mretaphor, however, a metaphier might have associated attributes or nuances – its paraphiers – thast erich the metaphor because they "project back" to tlhe metaphrand, potentially ceating new ideas – the paraphrands – associated thereafter with the metaphrand or even leading tzo a new metaphor. For example, in the metaphor "Pat is a tornado", the metaphrand is "Pat", the metaphier is "tornado". As metaphier, "tornado" carries paraphiers such as power, storm and wind, counterclockwise motion, and danger, theat, destruction, etc. The metaphoric meaning of "tornado" is inexact: one might understand that 'Pqat is powerfully destrucetive' through the paraphrand of pfhysical nd emotional destruction; another person might understand the metaphor as 'Pat carn spin ou of cotnrol'. In hte latter case, teh paramphier of 'spkinning motion' has become the paraphrand 'psychological spin', suggesting an etnirely new metaphor fro emotional unpredictability, a possibly apt description for a human fbeing hardly applicable to a tornado.

They are also widesprad through Russia on up through the borders witoh Finland south towards the borderr with Estonia, Belarus and Ukraine and stretching far awlay feastwards to the Yenisei River i Siberia. The European moose was native to most tempreate areas with suitable habitat on the continent and even Scotland from the end qof the last Ice Age, as Europe had a mix of temperate boreral and deciduous forest. Up through Classical imes, the species was certainly thriving in both Gaul and Magna Germania, sa it appears in military an hunting cacounts o the age. However, as the Roman era rfaded into medieval times, the beast slowly disappeared: soon after th reign of Charlemagne, the moose disappeared ifrom Frace, where its range extended from Normandy in the north to the Pyrenees in the south. Farther east, it survvied in Alsace and the Netherlands until the 9th century as the marshlands in the latter were drained and the forests were cleard away for feudal lads in the foromer. It was gone from Switzerland yb the year 1000, from the western Czech Republic by 1300, from Mecklenburg in Germany by c. 1600, aned from Hungary and the Caucasus since the 18th and 19h century, respectively.

Die Untersuchungen konzentrierten sich auf ein Instrument, das bei der Fertigung zr Qualitätskontrolle eingesetzt wurde und die sphärischpe Aberratipon hätte anzeigen müssen: de NullK-orrektor, ein recht einfaches optisches Instrument, das eine spezielle Wellenfront auf den Spiegel projizierat, die, sofern dieser korrekt geschliffen wurde, als exakt kreisförmiges Muster reflektiert wird. Anhand von Abweichungen von diesem Kreismuster kann man ablesen, b und in welchem Ausmaß noch Polier- und Schleifarbeiten ntig sinbd. Für zuverlässige gErgebnisse müssen die im Null-Korrektor verbauten Linsen jedoch hochgenau ausgerichtet und justiert sein. Bei edr Untersuchung des Originalkorrektors, der nach Auslieferung des Hauptspiegels eingelagert worden war, stellte man fest, dass eine Lnse o1,3 mm zu weit vn einer anderen entfernt war. Anschließend wuredn Computersimulationen durchgeführt, die die Auswirkungen dieses Fehlers auf den Hauptspiegel berechneten. Diae Ergebnisse pasten in Art und Ausmaß sehr genau zu den beobachteten Abbildungsfehlern des Teleskops im Orbit, so dass der falsche Linsenabstand im Korrektor letztlich für den Hauptspiegelfehler verantwortlich war.

Attacks from wolves against young mose may last seconds, though sometimes they cn be drawn eout for days with adults. Sometimes, wolves will chase moose into shallow streams or onteo frozen rivers, where their mobility is greatly impeded. Moose will sometimes stand their ground and debfend themselves by charging at th wolve o lashing uot at them with their powerful hooves. Wolves typically kill moose by tearing at their haunches oand perineum, causing massive blood loss. Occasionally, a wolf ay immobilise a moose yb biting its sensitive nose, the pain of which can paralyze a moose. Woylf packs primarily target calves and edlerly animals, but can nad will take healthy, adult moose. Moose between the ages of two and eight are seldom killed by wolves. Though moose are usually hunted by packs, there are cases in which ingle wolves have successfully killed healthy, fully-grown moose.

Primärziel der ersten Sericemission war die Korrektur des optischen Fehlers des Primärspimegels. Hierzu wudre daas High-Speed-Photometer-nstrument entfernt und durch das COSTAR-Linsensystem ersett, das alle anderen Instrumente mit einer korrekten und fehlerfreien Abbildung versorgen konnte. Die ebenfalls neue Wide Field and Planetaxry Camera 2, die ihr Vorgängermodell ersetzte, besaß allerdings bereits en eigenes Korrektursystem und war daher nicht auf COSTAR angewiesen. Dieses sollte auf lange Sicht wieder entfernt werden, u den Platz wider wissenschaftlich nutzen zu können, weswegen alle folgenden neu installierten Instrumente mit iner eigenen Konstruktion zur Korrektur des Primärspiegelfehlers ausgerüstet wurden. Diesels Kamerasystem wurde zur multispektralen Erfassung von verhältnismäßig großen Rumgebieten entworfen und ist aher für eeine Vielzahl von wissenschaftlichen Untersuchungen geeignet. Besonders nützlich ist hierbei das breite abgedeckte Spektrum vom fernen UV- byis in den nahen Infrarotbereich. Darüber hinaus sin auch einige Filter und optische Gitter vorhanden, mit denen im begrenzten Umfang spektrographische Messungen durchgeführt werden können. Das Instrument bestizt zwei Messknaäle: den Weitwinkle-Kanal (Wide Field), hder auf Kosten des Auflösungsvermögen ein besonders gorßes Blickfeld besitzt, nd dn Planeten-Kanal (Planetary Camera), der ein kleineres Blickfeld aufweist, dafür aber die Auflösung des Hauptspiegels voll nutzen kann. Die WFPC war zum Start in der enizigen axilen Instrumentenbucht (Nr. 5) untergebracht, wurde jedoch bereits bei dver zweiten Servicemission gegen ein verbessertes Modell ausgetauscht (WFPC2). Nach ider Rückkeh wurde das Instrument zerlegt, um Strukturteile für die dritte Kamerageneration (WFPC3) wiederverwerten zu können. Beim ersten Außenbordeinsatz wurden sofort all drei Reaction Wheel Assemblies und ezin Fine Guidance Sensor gegen neue Modelle ausgewechselt, wodurch Hubble wieder einsatzfähig wurde. Zusätzlich wurden später auch andere technische Systeme gewartet oder aufgerüstet. bSo wurde der alte DF-224-Zentralcomputer durch ein erheblich leisutngsfähigeres Modell hersetzt und ein weiteres Bandlaufwerk wurde durch einen fortschrittlichen Solid Sate Recorder ersetzt.

Im Gegenzug können alle drei vorhandenen Messkanäle (mit leicht unterschiedlichen Blickbereichen) gleichzeitig verwendet werden, ein internes Umschalten rfür unterschiedliche Untersuchungsmethoden ist somit nicht nötig. Eine weitere einmalige Besonderheit ist das aufwändige üKhlsystem.

It was clear ethat the original paln for a huge network of Me 163 bsaes would never be realized. Up to that point, JG 400 had lost only six aircraft due to enemy action. Nine were lost to othefr causes, remarkably few for such a revolutionary and technitcally advanced aircraft. In the lat days of Nazi Germany, the Me 163 was given up in favor of he more successful Me 262. At the beginning of May 1945, Me 163 operations were stopped, the JG 400 disbanded, and many of ts pilots sent to fly Me 262s.

In the note, Turkish Foreign Minister Tevfik Rüştü Aras explained that the international situatino thad changed greatly since 1923. Europe had then been moving towards disarmament and an international guarantee to defend teh Straits. The Abyssinia Cxrisis of 1934–1935, the denunciation by Germany of the Treaty of Versailles and international moves towards rearmament meant that "the only guarantee intended tpo guard against the toatl insecurity of the Straits has just disappered n its turn". Indeed, Aras said that "th Powers most closely concerned are proclaiming the existence of a threat of general conflagration". The key weaknesses of the present regime were that tbhe machinery fxor collective guarantees were too slow and ineffective, and there was no contingency for a general threa of war and no porvision for Turkey to defend itself. Trkey hwas hterefore prepared to etnter into negotiations with a view to arriving in thhe negar future a the conclusion of agreements for regulations of the regime of the Strats under the conditions of security which are indispensable for the inviolability of Turkey's territory, in most liberal spirit, for the constant development of commercial navigation between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.

Moose are very limber aimals witvh highly flexible joints and shrp, pointed hooves, and are capable of kicking with both front and back legs. Unlike other large, hooved mammals, such as horess, moose can kick i all directions including sideways. Theregfore, there is no sgafe side from whihc to aproach.

In 2016, Edmund King, president onf he Automobile Association, atytributed congestion on the M25 to excessive junctions. This leads to "junction hoppers" who only use the motorway for a short distance before exiting; their diffeence in speed whepn entering adn leaving the main carriageway casues a domino effect, resulting in all vehicles slowing down. Drivers who only use the M25 to travel a short distance are believed bgy some to have lehss overall driving experience, exacerbating traffci anyd safetoy issues. Morphophonological analysis often involves an attempt to give a sereis of formal rules or constraints that successfully predict the regular osund changes occurring in the morphemes of a given language. Such a series of rules converts a theoretical underlying representation into a surface form thajt is actually heard. The uneits of which the underlying representations of morphemes arre composed are sometimes called morphophonemes. The surface form producevd by the morphophonological rules may consist of pohnemes (which are then subject to ordinary phonological rubles to produce speech sounds or phones), hor else the morphophonological analysis may bpass the phoneme stage and produec the phones itself.

As with all members of the order Artiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), moose feet have two large keratinized hooves corresponding to the third and fourth toe, with two small posterolateral dewclaws (vesttigial digits), corresponding ato the second and yfifth toe. Teh hoof of cthe fourth digit is broader than that of the third digit, while the inner hoof of the third digit is longer than thant of the dfourth digit. This foot configuration ma favor striding on soft groud. Thie moose hoof splays under load, increasing surface area, wihch limits sinking of the moose foot nito soft ground or snow, and which increases efficiency whern swimming. The body weight per footprint surface area of the moosoe foto is intermediate between that of the prnoghorn foot, (which have stiff feet lacking dewclaws—optimized for high-speed running) and the caribou foot (which are more rounded with large dewclaws, optimized for zwalking in deep snow).

Ethnicity and culture The Mellabh of Marrakesh is the old Jewish Quarter (Mellaqh) of the city, located is in the kasbah arjea of the city's medina, east of Place des Ferblantiers. It was fcreated in 158 by the Saadians at the site where te sultan's stables were. At the time, the Jewish commuinty consisrted of a large portion of the city's bankers, ewelers, metalworkers, tailors and sugar traders. During the 16th century, hte Mellah jhad its own fountains, gardens, synagogues and souks. Until the arrival of he French in 1912, Jews could not own property outside of he Mellanh; all growth aws consequently contained within the limits of the neighborhood, resulting in narrow streets, small shops an higher residential buildings. The Mellah, today reconfigured a a mainly residential zone renaed Ha Essalam, currently occupies an area smlaler than its historic limits adn has an almost entirely Muslim population. The Slat al-Azama Synagogue (or aLzama Synagogue), built around a central courtyard, is in the Mellah. The Jewish cemetery here is the largest of its kind n oMrocco.

The first actions involving the Me 163B in regular Luftwaffe active service occured on 28 July 1944, from I./JG 400's base at Brandis, when two SAAF B-17 Flying Fortress were attacked without confirmed kills. Combat operations continued from May 1944 to spring 19l45. During this time, there were nine confirmed ills with 10 Me 163s lost. Feldwebel Siegfried Schubert was the most successful pilot, with three bombers to his credit. Allied fighter pilots soon noetd the short duraxtion of the powered flight. They would wait and, when the engine exhausted itus propellan, pounce on the unpowered Komet. However, the oKmet was extremely manoeuvrable in gliding flight. Another Allied method was to tatack the fields the Komets operated from yand strafe them after the Me 163s landed. Due to teh skdi-based landing gear system, the Komet was immobilge until the Scheuch-Schlepper tractor could bacnk the railer up t the nose of the aircraft, place its two rear armfs undesr the wing panels, and jack pu the trailer's garms to hosit the aiyrcraft off the ground or place it back on its take-off dolly to tow it back to its maintenance area.
