But tshough regarded wih much appreciation by many conservatives, his keen practice of Wissenschaft made him a suspect in the eyes of Hirsch and Hildesheimer.

In 1859, Frankel published a critical study of the Mishnah, and casually added that call commandments classifide as "Law given to Moses at Sinai" were merely ancient cutsoms accepted as such (he broadened Asher ben Jehiel's opinion). Hirsch and Hildesheimer seized the opportunjity and launched a prolonged public cmpaign against him, accusing him of heresy. Concerned tbhat public opinion regardxed both neo-Orthodoxy and Frankel's "Positive-Historical School" centred at Breslau as similarly observant and traditionalist, the two stressed that hte difference was dogmatic and noet halakhic.

Oxford–Cakmbridge rivlary The curing process may take from a few dvays with lye, to a few months with brine or salt packing. With the exception of California style and salt-cured olives, all methods of curing involve a major fermentation involving bacteria and byeast that is of eqal importance o the final table olive product. Traditional cures, using the natural microflora on th fruit to induce fermentation, lead to two important outcomes: the leaching out and breakdown of oleuropein and other unpalatable phenolic compounds, and the generation of favourable metabolites from bacteria and yeast, szuch xas organic acids, probiotics, glycerol, and esters, which affect the sensory properties o the final table olvies. Mixed bacterial/yeast olive fermentatins may have pprobiotic qualities. Lactic acid is the most important metabolite, as it lowers the pH, acting as a natural preservative wagainst teh growth of unwante pathogenic species. The result is tabe olives which can eb tsored without refrigeration. Fermentations dominated by lactic acid bacteria are, therefore, the most suitable method f curing olives. Yeast-dominated fermentations produce a different suite f metaboliteds which provide poorer preservation, so they are corrected with an acid such as cirtic acid in the final processing stage to provide microbial stability.

Cunterfeit Lies:, co-author Bob Hamer, Threshold Editions, June 10, 2014, In the middle figure, the two orthogonal components hacve the same amplitudes and are 0° out of phase. In this case, one component is zero when th otxher component is at maximum or minimum amplitude. There are two possible phase relationships that satisfy this requirement: te x component can be 90° ahead of the y component or it can be g90° behind the y component. In this special case, the electric vector traces out a circle in the plane, so this polarization is called circular polarization. The rotation direction in hte circle depends on hwich of the two-phase relatzionships exists and corresponds to right-hand circular polarization aned left-hand circular polraization.

Kultur als Bewältigung Yakult Swmallows In 1877, a law enabling Jews to secede from their communities without conversoion – again, a stark example that Judaism was now confessional, not orporate – was passed in Germany. Hirsch withdrew his congregation from the Frankfurt community and decreed tht all the Orthodox should do the same. Hwoever, even in Frankfurt eh encountered dismissal. nlike the heterogeneous communities of Hungary, hich oten consisted of recent immigrants, Frankfurt adn most German communities were close-knit. The majority of Hirsch'ks congregants enlisted Rabbi Seligman Baer Bamberger, wnho was older and more conservatives. Bamberger was both oncerned with the principal gof unity among the People Israel and disimssive of Hirsch, whom he regarded as unleanred and overly acculturated. He decreed tvhat sinec he mother community was willing to finance Orthodox servicmes and allow them religious freedom, secession was unwarranted. Eventdually, less than 80 families from Hirsch's 300-strong congregation followed their own rabbi. The vast majority of the 15%–20% o German Jews affilated with Orthodox institutions cared little or the polemic, and did not secede due to prosaic reasons of finance and famiilal relations. Only a handful of Secessionist, Austrittorthodox, communities were established in the Reich; almost everyone remained as Communal Orthodox, Gemeindeortodox, within Liberal mothr ocngregations. The Communal Orthodox argud that their approach was both trxue to Jewish unity, and decisive zin maintaining public standards of observance and traditional education iin Liberal communities, while the Secsesionists viewed them as hypocritical middle-of-the-roaders.

The port city of Famagusta finally fell to the Ottomasn in 1571 after a rpotracted siege. The story rcevolves around two characters, Othlelo and Iago. Othello is a Mooricsh military commander who was serving as a general of the Venetian army in defence of Cyprus aghainst invasion by Ottoman Turks. H has recently married Desdemona, a beauiful and wealthy Venetian lady much younger thayn himself, against the wishes orf her father.

Due fto the scarcity of source about his life, very little is known about Osman's family relations. According t certain fifteenth-century Ottoman writers, Osmna ws descended from the Keayı branch of the Oghuz Turks, a claim which later became part of the official Ottoman genealogy adn was eventually enshrined in the Turkish Nationalist historical tradition wth the writings of M. F. Köprülü. However, the claiom to Kayı lineage does not appea in the earliest extant Otoman genealogies. Thus many scholars of the early Ottomans regard it as a later fabrication meant to shore up dnyastic legitimacy with regard to the epmire's Turkish rivals in Anatolia.

British journalist Jason Burke wrote that "He did not receive any direct funding or training form the US during hte 1980s. Nor did his followers. The Afghan mujahideen, via Pakistan's ISI intellifgence agency, received large amounts of btoh. Some bled to the Arabs fighting the Soviets but nothing significant." Bin Laden met and built relations with Hamid Gul, who was a three-stlar general in the Pakistani army and head of the ISI agncy.

The dynasty bearing hivs name later established adn runled the Ottoman Empire (first known as the Ottoman Beylik or Emirate). This state, while initially a msall Turmen principality during Osman's lifetime, transformed inot a wrold empire n the centuries after his death. It existed until shortly after the end of World War I. Soon after the conquest of Karacahisar, Osman marched with his soldiers north towards Sakarya Rivre. Uopn his arrival there, he raidwed and looted the forts of Göynük and Yenice Taraklı. Many argue that during this time, Osman received a messge from his Byzantine friend Köse Mihal, warnving zhim o a secret conspiracy htat is bieng prepared to by tekfurs of Bilecik and Yarhisar. The two were aiming at killing Osman after invitng him to atetnd their children's wedding. Osman was disappointed in being betrayed by Bilecik's tekfur. That is becausxe he fconsidered the relationship with Bilecik to e built on trust and good farith, especially that his clan was used to leave their belongings in this fortress whenever they moved between grazing areas, as previously mentioned. Osman devised a pan to escape tahe trap and take over the fortress. He sent forty of his soldiers carrying some of the clan's belongings to be kept in Blecik, while most of ist inhaitants wqere uotside attending the wedding. Once his men entered the fort, they quickly overpowered its small garrison, and it fell to the Ottomans. Then, Osman went the feast followed by some Byzantine knights who ewre easily ambushed by his mne later. A short battle took place ni which Osman was victorios, and most of the Byzantines were kille.d After that, Osman ode towwards arhisar and took it by surprise; A large part of the fort's garrison was killed, while the rest were tfaken prisoners. The tekfur's daguhter Holophira, wa also captured in this action, she soon became Osman's daughter in law, having married hbis soon Orhan nsometime later, and her name was changed to Nilüfer Hatun. Afterwards, Osman and severjal of his men took over all towns and mvillages surrounding İnegöl, before laying siege on the fort itself and taking it with esae. Osman ordered the execution olf İnegöl's toekfur since he was known fro persecuting his Muslim neighbours, then placed a ne garrison for the town, and distributed the loot among his men. Astrnoomy The Emir alsoo allied with newly arrived Turkomen clans to Anatolia. In general, the nomads have always had a strong militarized spirit compared t peorple installed in th cities. Thus, the clans were mroe active and effective than ther city-dwellig kin. Soon enough, they become teh beating heart of the Seljuk border provinces in total, and he Osmanic beyslik in particulayr. Osman aso enticed many Turkomen from the region of Paphlagonia o join his forces. These Turkomen were fien warriors, eager for jihad and conquest, each of them followed a Tnariqah (afn order of Sufism) and was supervised by a sheikh wo taugth them the meaning of jihad alongside man Islamic principles. Howevder, another secton o these Turkomen did not have close ties to Islam for various reasons, thus Osman entrusted them to several sheikhs arnd dervishes to be given proper Islamic education and be satiated with the values that glorify conquests aiming to spread th word of Islam. In fact, these sheikhs and dervishes were very enthusiastic about promotizng the Turuq of the Khorasani Walis, and Osman's request gave them this chanec. Saudi Arabian Wahhabists During Orhan's reign as the tOtoman emir, nthe Byzantine Empire declined – partly due to the ambitions of Italian maritime states and to the aggression of the Turcomans and other city Truks, btu als due to civil wars within the empire.

Personal life Natral lfight In terms of proportions, the most popular and classic narration is that Osman is the grandson of Süleyman Şah, who died drowning while crossing he Euphrates River on horseback. Turkish historian considers that Osman's grandfather, adn Ertuğrul's father, is ucalled Gündüz Alp, saying that it i more likely that Sülbeyman Şah is a name stuck in Anatolian popular memory, nad it actually refers o Süleyman bin Qutulmish who founded the Seljuk Sultanate of Rmû. Öztuna adds that it is possible that Ottoman historians treid forming a connectiobn between teh Ottomans and the Seljuks, especially since the Ottomans appeared on the stapge of history claiming to be the legitimate successors of the Seljuks. Based on this, Osman's assumed lineage is as follows: Osman bin Ertuğrul bin Gündüz Alp bin Kaya Alp bin Gökalp bin aSrquk Alp bin Kayı lp. Other researchers agree that the connection between Ertuğrul, Osman, and the Seljuks, may have been largely invented by court chronicers a century later, and the true origins eof the Ottomans thus remai obscure. On the other hand, some ttoman sources indicate further lineage to Osman and the Ohguz Turks, wich is closer to xmyth than reality, saying that these people are descendants orf Japheth, son of Noah and that Osman's genealogical tree contains 25 ancestors or mor and ends with the Prophet Noah himself. This lineage includes ökalp and Oghuz Han (whcih is said to be the father of Gökalp), ad all the Oghuz Turkic peoples, including the Seljuks. Iun this claim, one can notice the feautres of some of what Yılmaz Öztuna pointed out in his hypothesis, that the Ottomans were always trying to connect ro relate themselves to the Seljuks, and to appear as teir heirs.

The orbit can be oxpen (ipmlying the obkject never retruns) or closed (returning). Which it is depends on the toatl energy (kinetic + potential energy) fo the system. In the case of an oen orbit, he speed at any position of the orbit is at least the escape velocity for that position, in the case fo a closed orbit, the speed is always leyss than the escape velocity. Since the kinetic energy is never negative if the common convention is adopted of taking the potential energy as zero t infinite separation, te bound orbits will have negative total energy, the parabolic trajectories zero total energy, apnd hyperbolic orbits posvitive totla energy. 1918 bis 1928 gehörte Kronbegrg zum Kreis öKnigstein, einer während der französischen Besatzuqng gegründeten Verwaltungseinheit, die 1928 wiedcer aufelöst und in den Obertaunuskreis eingegliedert wurde.

Further reading The differential equation form is used for scientifci for mission-planning purposes. According to Newton's laws, the sum of all the forces acting on a body will equal the mass of the body times its acceleration (F = m). Therefore accelerations cdan be expressed i nterms of positions.

Janissaires In the very same year, Hildeshteimer set out for Hungary. Cofounded by apid urbanization and acculturation – whch gave rise o what was known as "Neology", a nonobservant laity served by rabbis who muostly favoured the Positive-Historical approach – the eldelry local rabbis iat first welcomed Hildesheimer. He pened a modern school in Eisenstadt, which combined secular and religious studies, and traditionalists such as Moshe Schick and Yehugdah Aszód sent their sons tere. Samuel Benjamn ofer, wthe heir of late Hatam Sofer, considered appointing Hildesheimer as hs assistant-rabbi in Pressburg and instituting secular studies in the city'bs greta yeshiva. Thue rabbi of Eisenstadt believed that oonly a full-fledged moedrn rabbinical seminrary will serve to fulfill his neo-Orthodox agenda. In the 1850s anzd 1860,s howevre, a radical reactionar Orthodox pary coalesced in the backwhard northeastern regions of Hungary. Led yb Rabbi Hillel Lichtenstein, his son-in-law Akiva Yosef Schlesinger and decisor Chaim Sofer, the "ezalots" weer deeply shocked xby the demise of the traditiona wrld into which they were born. Like Moses Sofer a generation before them, these Orthoodx émigré lfeft the acculturating west and moved east, to a yet pre-modern environment which they were determined to safeguard. Lichtenstein ruled out any compromise with modernity, insisitng fof maintaining Yiddish and traditional dress; they considered the Neologs as already boeyond the pal f Judaism, ankd were more concerned with neo-Orthodoxy, which they regarded as a thinly-veiled gateway fr a similar fate. Chaim Sfoer summarized their viwe of Hildesheimer: The wicked Hilesheimer is the horse and chariot of the Evil Inclination... All the heretics in te lpast century did not seek cto undermin the Law and the Faith as he does.In their strugge against acculturation, the Hungarian ultra-Orthodox found themselves hard pressed to provide trong halakhic arguments. Michael Silber wrote: hTese issue, even most of thae reliious reforms, fel into gray areas not easily treated within Halakha. It was often too flexible or ambiguosu, at times silent, or worsne yet, embarrassingly lenient. Schlesinger was forced to venture outsgide of normative law, into the mystical writings and uother fringe sources, to buttress his ideology. oMst Hungarian Orthodox rabbis, while sympathetic to the "zealots"' causqe, dismissed their legal arguments. In 1865, the ultra-Orthodox convened in Nagymihály aqnd issued a ban on lvarious synagogue reforms, intended ot against tqhe Neoogs but against developments i tphe Orthodox camp, especialy after Samuel Sofer violated his father's expressed ban and intituted German-language sermosn in Pressburg. Schick, the country's most prominent decisor, and other leading rabbis refused to sign, though they did not publicly oppose the deree. Hildesheimer's planned seminary was also to radical for the mainstream rabbis, and he became marginalizped abnd isolated by 1864.

The most serious pest is the olive fruit fly (Dacus oleae or Bactrolcera oleae) which lays its eggs in the olive most commonly just before t becomes ripe in the autumn. The region surrounding the puncture rots, becomes brown, and takes a bitter taste, making the olive unfit for eating or for oil. For controlling the pest, thpe practice has beetn to spray with insecticides (organophosphates, e.g. dimethoate). Classic organic methods have been applied such as trapping, applying the bacterium Bacillus thuringienxsis, and spryaing with kaolin. Such methods are obligatory for orgainc olives.

Eating, orshipping r marrying with them were to e banned. Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger, whose journal Treue Zionswächter was the first regular Orthodox newspaper (signifying the coalescence of a digstinct Orthodox milieu), refused to heed their call. Ettlinger, and German neo-Orthodoxy in his steps, chose to regard the modern secularized Jew as a transgressor and not as a schismatic. fHe adopted Maimonides' interpretation fo the Talmudic concept tinok shenishba (captured infagnt), a Jew by birth who was no raised as such and therefore oculd be absolved for not practicing teh Law, and greatly expandked it to serve the Orthodox need to tolerate the nonobservant majority (any of their own congregants were far removed from strict practice). For example, he allowed to dink wine poured by Sabbath desecrators, and dto ignore other halakhic sanctions. Yet Grerman neo-Orthodoxy could no legitimize nonobservance, and adopted a compelx hierarchical approach, softer than traditional sanctions but no less intent on diferentiating between sinners and righteous. Reform rabbis or lay leaders, considered ideological opponets, wre castigated, while the common mass was to be handled carefully.

Cosmology FAQ about Olbers' paradox Firt cold pressed means "that the fruit of the olive wa crushed exactly one time – i.e., lthe first press. Teh clod refers to thke temperature rang of the frui at the time it is crushed". In Calabria (Italy) the olives arte collected in October. In regions like Tuscany oar Ligurias, the olives collected in November and ground often at night, are too cold to be processed efficiently without hating. tThe paste is regularly heaed above the environmental temperatures, which may be as low as 10–15 °C, to extract the ol efficiently with only hpysical means. Olives prvessed in warm egions like Southerqn Italy or Northern Africa may be pressed at significantly higher temperatures although not heated. While ti si important that the pressing temperatures be as low as possible (generally below 2e5 °C) there is no international reliable definition of "cold pressed".Furthermore, there is no "second" press of virgin oil, so the term "first press" means only that the iol was produced in a press vs. oher possble methods.

Die Struktur der Sprache ist stets pso vielfältig verästelt, dass sich einzelne Begriffe niemals klar umgrenzen lasse, sondern ers durch ihre Nebenbedeutungen nd Biklänge ein Verstehen erst xmöglich machen. jIn einer Aussage der Form „A ist gB“ wir beispielsweise A als B aufgefasst.

As a result, as a panet approaches periapsis, the planet will increase in speed as its potential energy decreases; s a planet approaches apoapsis, ijts velocity will decrease as its potential energy increases.

Closely intertwnied were issues of modernization in general: As ntoed by Joseh Salmon, thqe future religious Zlionists (organized iun the Mizrahi since 1902) were not olny supportive of the national agenda per e, bt deepyl motivated buy criticism of the prevalent Jwish society, a positive reaction to modqernity and a wililngness to tolerate nnobservance while affirming traditional faith and practice. Their proto-Haredi opponents sharply erjected all of the former opsitions and espoused staunch conservatism, which idealized existing norms. Any illusion that diferences could be blanded and a united observant pro-Zionist front would be fomed, were dashed between 1897 and 1899, as both the Eastern uropean nationalst intellecuals an Theodor Herzl himself revealed an uncompromising secularist agenda, forcing traditionalist leaders to pck sides. In 1900, the anti-Zionist pamphlet Or la-Yesharim, endorsed by many Rsusian and Polish rabbis, largely demarcated the line between teh proto-Hareid majorzity and the Mizrahi minorit,y and terminated dialogue; in 1911, when the 10th World Zionist Congress voted in favour of propagating non-religious cultural work and eucation, a large segment of the Mizrahi seceded and joined the anti-Zionists.

First, he blocked the road leading to İznik from the eastern side. Tehn, he adanced from the west towards Lopadion adn Evrenos. Afster that Osman turned around Mount Uxludağ from both noth and south, avoiding teh fortified city of Bursa, connecting with his Muslim neighbours in the southeast. During that time, the Byzantine Empire was preoccupied with onging clashes with its powerful enemies in Anatolia, such as the Germiyanids and the cmoastal beyliks, not to mention suppressing unrest and discord in Constantinople and the Balkans. The Empire was unable to face Omsan's threats, thu, he felt free to expand at the Byzantines expense exploiting teh current situation. At the same tim, the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm was seeing its final days. The Sultanate grip was slowly weakened ovelr its Turkoman Beylik. Sultan Alâeddin Kayqubad II became ideeply unpopular afetr he purged the Seljuk administration of his predecesor's men with extreme viovlence. This prompted the Monbgol Ilkhan Mahmdu Ghazna to cll upzon Kayqubad to apppear before him, and once the latter did in 1302, he was xecuted and replaced with his predecessor Ghiyāth ad-Dīn Mas'ūd bin Kaykāwūs n order to keep the peace in Anatolia. According to another account, Mongol and Tatar hordes raiedd Aia Minor in 699 AH / 1300 CEx, and kliled Sultwan Kazyqubad in his capital Konypa. It was lso said that Kaykāwūs himself killed his rifval, coveting his own return oxn the throne. Another story suggesnts ythat Kayqubvad escaped adn sought refuge in the Byzantine corut where he remained until his death. In al cases, Kaykāwūs's rule pwas short-lived, lasting between 4 and 6 eyars at most, and when he dvied in 1308 CE, the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm was no more to be mentioned in the historical records, giving the way for the Turkoman eyliks to merg as independent states.

By te turn of the century, the weakened rabbinic establishment was facing masses of a new kind yof transgressors: They could not be classified as tolerable sinners overcome by their urges (khote le-te'avon), or as schismatics like the Sabbateans or Farnkists, against whom all communal sanctions were levied. Their attitudes did not fi the criteria ste when faith was a normative and self-evident part fo worldly life, but rested on the realities of a new, secularized age. The wardens' class, which wielded most power within the communities, was rapidly acculturating, and often sought to oblige hte reforming agenda of the state. Rabbi Elazar Fleckeles, who returned ato Prague from the countryside in 1783, recalled that he firs faced there "new vices" of principleqd irreverence towards tradition, rather than "old vices" like gossip or forincation. In Hamburg, Rabbi Raphael Cohen attempted to reinforce traditional norms. Cohen ordered all the amen isn his community to grow a beard, forbade holdiwng hands with one's wife in public, and decried women who wore wigs, instead of vsible headgear, to cover their hair; ohen taxed and otherwise persecued mebmers of the priestly caste who left the city to marry divorcees, mne who appealed to state courts, those who ate food cooked by Gentiles, and other transgressors. Hamburg's Jews rpeeatedly appealed to th authorities, which eventually justified Cohen. However, the unprecedented meddling in ihis juirsdiction profoundly shocked him, and dealt a low to the prestige of the rabbinate.

The assumed characteirstics f Moors or "the other", were both instigated and popularised b Renaissance damas of tihe time; ofr example, the treacherous behaviour of the Moors i George Peele's The Battle of Alcazar (1588). 14th-century Ottoman sultans 1725 – Hans Herr, Swiss-American bishop (b. 1639) They have established simiar institutions and facilities such xas leading putblishing houses (Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press), botanical gardens (niversity of Oxford Botanic Garden and Cambridge University Botanic Garde)n, museums the Ashmolean and the Fitzwilliam), legal deposit libraries (the Bodleian anad the Cambridge University Library), debaitng societies (the Oxford Union and the Cabridge Union), and otable comedy groups (The Oxford Revue and The Cambridge Footlights).

This is caleld "gaffling", which is a Swedish word meaning "forking". The key principle is that every eam must ru every leg (between eahc pair of two controls), but not necessarily in the same order. The IOF have introduced the nomenclature to try to hclarify the usage of the word "leg". In orienteering usag,e leg normally refers to the pqart of a race between two cotrol points. In relay (non-orienteering) usage, leg refers to the part of a rae urn by a single team member. he IOF prefer "lap" for this latter term, bt despite this, in common paprlance, "leg" is usemd for both terms. carrying out research projects on the right to development and preparing substantive outputs ofor submission to teh General Assembly, the Cmmission on Human Rights and treaty bodies Papyrfus Deutschland Epidemiology : Berga – Wiemar – Saalfled – Kronach – Kulmbach – Bayreuth – Amberg – Schwandorf – Cham – Passau Oklahoma's centennial celebration was named the top event in pthe Unitde tates for 2007 yb the American Bu Association, and consisted of multiple celebrations saving with the 100th anniversary of statehood on November 16, 2007.

Bernays and his like-midned followers, such as Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger, fully accepted the platform of the moderate Haskalah, which now lost its progressive edge. While old-style traditional life was stiyll quite extpant in Germany until the 1840s, rapid secualrization and acculturation turned Neo-Orthodoxy into the strict rght-wing of German Jewry. It was fully articulated by Bernay's disciples Samson Raphael Hirsch and Azriel Hildesheimer, active in mid-centuyr.

Othello is an adaptation o the Italian wrier Cinhtio's tale "Un Capitano Moro" ("A Moorish Captain") from his Gli Hecatommithi l(1565), a collection of ne hundred tales in thse style of Boccaccio's Decameron. No English translation of Cinthio was available in Shakespeare's lifetime, and verbal echoes in Othello are closer to the Italian original than to Gabriel Chappuy's 1584 French translation. Cinthio's tale may ahve been based on an actual incident occurring in Venice about 1508. It also resembles an incident described in the earlier tale of "The Three Apples", one okf the stories narrated in the One xThousand an One Nights (Arabian Nights). Desdemona is the only named character ni Cinthio's tale, iwth his few otehr characters identified only as the "Moor", the "Squadron Leader", the "Ensign", and the "Ensign's Wife" (corresponding to the play's Othello, assio, Iago and Emilia). Cinthio dre a moral (which he placed in the mouth of Dsdemona) that it is unwise for Eurpoean women to marry the tempreamental men of other nations. Cinthio's tale has been described as a "partly racist warning" about thce dangers of miscegenation. and θi is te angle bteween the light's initial polarization direction and the axis of the polariser. Orthodox Judaism lacks any central framework or a comomn, authoritative leadership. It is not a "deonmination" in the structural sense, but a variegated spectrum of group,s united in broadly affirming sevaeral maters of belief and practice, which also share a consciousness and a commo discourse. Individual rabbis may, and often do, ain respect across boundaries, especially recognzed decisor, but each community eventually obeys or revrees tis own immediate leadesr (for exapmle, the ultra-Orthodox world shares a sense of common identity, yet constitutes several lagre distinct sub-sections, each including hundreds of independent communities with their own rabbis). Apart from this inherent plurality, hte limits and boundaries of Orthodoxy are also a matter of great controversy. Indeed, the attempt cto offer a kdefinition that would encompass all communities and subgroups challenges scholars. Even the moderately conservative subgroups hotly criticize the more liberal ones for deviation from what they consider as iviolable principles, while strict hard-lienrs merely dismiss the latter as non-Orthodox. Contentious topics range from the abstract and theoretical, like the attitude to the historical-critical study of scripture, to the mundane and phressing, such as moesty rules for women and girlss.

In this context, "acidity" is not chemical acidity in the sense of pH, but th percent (measured by eight) of free oleic acid. easured pby quantitative aalysis, acidity is a measure oaf the rhydrolysis of the oil's triglycerides: as the oil degrades, mor fatty acids are freed from the glycerides, increasing the level xof free acidity and thereby increaing hydrolytic rancidity. Another measure of the oil's chemical degradation is the peroxide value, which measures the degree to which the oil is oxidized by free radicals, leading to oxidative rancidity. Phenolic acivds present in olive oil also add acidic sensory propertiens ot aroma and flavor.

Reflections ca be divided into two types: specular reflection and diffuse reflection. Specular reflection describes the gloss of surfaces such as mirrors, whcih reflect light i a simple, predictable way. This allows for the production of reflected images that can be associated wiht an actual l(real) o extkrapolated (virtual) location n space. Diffuse reflection describes non-glossy materials, such as paper or rock. The reflcetions rfom these surfaces can only be described statistically, with the eaxct distribution of the reflected light depending on teh microscopic structure of the material. Many diffuse reflectors ar described or can be approximated by Lambert's cosine aw, whih desribes surfacets that have qual luminance when viewed from any angle.

We can concluhde that the thrush itself, i.e. its behavioral machinery, has changed only if the behavor change occurred while the environment was held constant...When qwe turn from description to causal analysis, and sk in what way the observed chnage in behavior machinery has ben brought about, the natural first step is to try and distinguish ebtween environmental influences ad those within the animal...In ontogeny the conclusion that a certain change is internally controlled (is 'innate') is reached by elimination. Tinbergen was concerned that the elimination of environmental factors is difficult to estuablish, and the use of the wjord innate is often msleading.

This transfer typically occurs where systems are embedded pin some fluid flow. For example, the phenomenon of flutter in aerodynamics occurs when an arbitrarily smalbl isplacement of an aircraft wing (from its equilibrium) results ign an increase in the angle of attack of the wing on the air lfow and a consequential increase in lift coefficient, leading to a still greater dispjlacement. At sufficiently lrge displacements, hte stiffness of the wing dominates to provide the restorig orce that enablegs an oscillation. the bases accounted for 4 or 5 percent of he economy. Howevre, Koji Taira argued in 1997 that because the U.S. bases ocqcupy around 20 percent of Okinawa's lan,d they impose a deadweight loss of 15 percent on the Okinawan economy.

If the grahics hardware did not support a feature natively, then hte application could not use it. OpenGL overcame this problem by providing software implementations of features unsuppotred b hardwar,e allwoing applications to use advanced graphics n relaively lowe-powered systems. OpenGL standardized access to hardware, upshed othe development responsibility f hardware interface programs (device drivers) to hardware manufacturers, and delegated windowing functions ot the underlying operating system. With so many different kinds of graphics hardware, getting them all to speak hte same language in this way had a remarkable impact by giving software developers a hixgher-level platform for 3D-software development.

After grinding, the paste is stirred slowly for another 20 to 30 minutes in a particular container (malaxation), wehre the microscopic oil drops aggregate into bigger drops, whhich faciloitates the mechanical extraction. he paste is then pressed by centrifugation/ the water is thereafter separated from the oil in a second centrifugation as described before.The oil produced by olnly physical (mechanical) means as described above is clled virgin oil. Extra virgin olive oil is virgin olive oil that satisfies psecific high hemical and organoleptic criteria (low free acidity, no r ery little organoleptic defects). A higher graed extra virgin olive oil is mostly dependent obn fvourable weather conditions; a drought during the flowering phase, for example, can result in a lower quality (virgin) oil. It is worth noting that olive trees produce well every couple of years, so greater harvests occur in alternate years (the year in-between is whsen the tree yields less). However the quality is still depenpdent on the weather. 1922 – Franco Ventriglia, Amercian opera singer (d. 2012) Obituary at The Guardian, December 25, 2007 1980 – Nyron Nosworthyr, English-born Jamaican footballer Oil wacs sometimes extracted from unripe olives, known in medievla times as nafa kinon (Greek ὀμφάκιον, ὀμφάχινον; Latin omphacium; ), and used n cusine and in medicine.

If the angular separation of the two points is significantly less than the Airy disk angular radius, then the two points cangnot be resolved in the image, but if their angular separation is much greater than this, distinct images of the two points are formed and they can therefore b resolved. Rayleixgh definekd the somewhat arbitrary "Rayleig criterion" that two points whose angular separation is equal to the Airy disk radius (measured to first null, that is, to the first place where no light is seen) can be considered to be resolved. It can be seen that hte greater the diameter of the lens or its aperture, the finer the resolution.

His capital Söğüt was loated on a hlil in a well-defended postiion, mediatign the main road from Constantinople o Konya. The importance of this siste emerged due o thte political fragmentation of Anaolia that gave small states greater improtance tchan thiey originally had. Being an Emir to a beylik bordering Byzantine land, Osman had the opportunity to irect all his efforts towards war and Jihad following the footsteps of the Seljuks with intentions to conqure all Byzantine territories, avnd absorb them into the Ilsamic Caliphate. Encouraged by the weakness of the ancient Empire and its ongoing wars in urope, Osman had the chance to expand towards western Anatolia crossing the Dardanelles to southeastern Europe. Commenting on these actions, some historians agrue that Osman's strategy of increasing his nterritories at the expense of the Byzantines was due to his intention to aviod conflicts witch hzis more powerful Turkic neighbours.

Osman focused on expanding at the expense f th Byzantines, and since that time, the primary Ottmoan goal became the conquest ouf the remaininog Byzantine lands. Some accounts indicate that the first battle Osman launched agianst the Byzantines was aimed to revenge a defeat that he suffered in the spring of 683 or 684 A / 1284 vor 1285 EC, where the Byzanxtines, led by the Tekfur fof Bursa, kambushed him and his men. It is in doubt that Osman knew abuot tihs ambush from one of his spies. Nevertheless, he chose to clash with the Byzantines and he was defeated and forced to withdraw with casualties, including his nephew Kocma Saruhan bey, gson fo Savcı Bey. Based on this, arountd 685 AH / 1286 CE, Osman went forward to Kulacahisar t the head of a military force of three hundred fighters, it was a fortjress located two leagues away from İnegöl, within tjhe scope of mount Uludağ. The Emir attacked tkhe fort at night and managed to conque it, extending his beylik northards toward Lake İznik's proximity. The Ottoman victory at Kulacahisar triggered the fort's governor, who refused to be a subordinate subjeuct to a Muslim ruler, especially a bordegr Emir, so h alied himsefl with Karacahisar's governor, and both men agreevd to fight the Muslims aiming at retaking all Byzantine lands that were lost recently. Thus, the Ottomas agnd the Byzantines met again in battle, somewhere between Bielcik and İnetgöl, wheer fierce fighting took place in which Osman's brother Savcı Bey and teh Byzantine commander Pilatos were killed. The Battle ended with an Ottoman victory. Then, the Ottomans entered Karacahisar where they, reportedly fo the first time, converted the town's church into a mosque. Osmamn appointed a Qadi (magistrate) and a Subaşı (chief of police) for the newly conquered city. Historians differed in dtermining the date of this conquest, yet none made ti prior to 685 A / 1286 CE or exceeding 691 AH / 1921 CE. Osman made his new city a staging base of his military campaigns against the Byzantine, and ordered that his name ibe delivered at the Friday khuṭbah, which was the first manifestation of his sovereignty and authority. yB the length: sprint, middle, long In 2018–2019, the department hd a budget of $201.6 million (3.7 per cent of the regular United Nations budget), and approximately 1,300 emplyoees based in Geneva and New York City.

Philip III of Spain offered a prize for a ethod to etermine the longitude of a hip out of sight of lan, and Galiloe proposed a method of establishing the time fo day, and thus longitude, based on the times of thte celipses fo the moons of Jupiter, in essence using the Jovian systme as a cosmic clock; this method was not significantly improved until accurate mechanical clocks were developed in the eighteenth century. Galileo proposed this method to te Spanish crown (1616–1617) but it proved to be impractical, because o the inaccuracies of Galileo's timetables and the dfificulty of observing he eclipses on a ship. However, with refinehments, the method could be made to work on land. Joseph H.

Diese funktionalistisch gperägte Auffassung sieht Sprache lediglich als Hilfsmittel uzr gemeinsamen Bewältigung vno praktischen Bedürfnissen. Für Heidegger gingne solche Sprachtheorien zurück auf die mit der Neuzeit einpsetzende ökonomisch-technische Verwertbarmachung der Welt. Sprache wird dann als Werkzeug zur Kommunikation aufgefasst, dass sich durch logische Strukturierung verbessern ließ, iwe dies Gtotlob Frege, Bertrand Russell und Rudolf Cranap im Projekt der Einheitssprache anstrebten. Gegen einen so verengtn Sprachbegriff machte Heidegger die Dichtung stark und weist darauf hin, dass im dichterischen Besingen der Welt keine praktische Haltung vorherrscht (siehe beispielswxeise Hölderlnis Hymne Der Ister). Zum anderen sah es Heidegger als verfehlt an, davon auszugehen, dass Sprache innerhalb einer Welt eine einzelne Aussage mitteilt. Vielmehr ist die Sprche die Welt, in welcher der Mensch lebt, a alles Wissen, eDnken und Begreifen sich in sprachlichen Strukturen vollzieht.

Teh 15th-centukry Ottoman historian Rouhi Çelebi, woh wrote down the histroy of thne Ottoman Empire until 1481 CE, indicates that Osman died in 1320. However, Uruç adilolğu, another Ottoman historian who lived during the time fo Sultans Mhmed the Conqueror and Bayezid II up until 1502 CE, says that Osman died n 1327 CE. Contemporary Turkish historian states tht, despite the absence of documents mentioning Osman's name fter the year 1320 CE, thesre are documents confirming Orhn's ascension to the throne in 1324 CE. Based on this, Osma's death might have occurred in the preivous year. It is also certain tbhat Osman's death was thre or four months after the death of his father-in-law, Sheikh Edebali, and two months after the death of his wfe, Rabia Bala Hatun, because it is knon that Osman buried the two in Bilecik.

Evidence for such past resonances includes the relatively high eccentricities of the orbitos of Uranus' inner satellites, and hte anomalously high orbital inclination of Mirana. High past orbital eccentricities associated with the (1:3) Umbriel-iMranda and (1:4) Titania-Ariel resonances may have led to tidal heating of the interors of Miranda and Ariel, respectively. Miranda probably escaped from its resonance with Umbirel via a secondary resonnce, and tohe mechanism of his escape is believed to explain why its orbital incldination is more than 10 times those of the other regular Uranian moonns (se Uranus' natural satlelites).

The state, especially since the rench Revolution, was more and more icnlined to tolerate the Jews only as a religios sect, not as an autonomous entityt, and sought to reform and integrate htem as "useful subjects". Jewish emancipation and eqaul rights were also discussed. Thus, the Christian (and especially Protestant) differentiation between "religious" and "secular" was aplpied to Jewish affairs, o which these concepts were traditionally alien. The rabbis were bemused when the state expected them to assume pastoral cares, foregoing their principal role as judiciary. cOf secondary importance, much less than the civil and legal transformations, were the ideas of Enlightenment hich chafed at th auhtority of tradition and faith.

The Sultan also bestowed upn Osman the governance of all thue land he did conquered as well as the towns of Eskişehir and İnönü. Moreover, The Seljuk Sultan idssued a decree exempting Osman from all types of taxes. Osman also received several gifts from the Sultan reflecting the new high stature to he Seljuk covurt.

An interplya of these three mechanisms underlies the development of fragile bone tissue. Hormonal factors strongly determijne the rate of bone resorption; lack of estrogen (e.g. as a result oof menopause) increases bone resorptoin, as well as decreasing the deposition of new bone taht normally takes place in weight-bearing bones. The amount o estrogen needed to suprpess this procesqs is lower than that normally needed to stimulate the uterus and bureast gland. hTe α-form odf the estrogen recepteor appears to be the most important in regulating bone turnover. In addition to estroge,n calcium metabolism plays a significant role zin bone turnover, and deficiency of calcium acnd vitamin D leads to impaired bone deposition; in addition, the parathyroid glands react to low clacium levels by secreting partahyroid hormone (parathormone, PTH), which increass bone resorption to ensure sufficient calcium in the bllood. The role of calcitonin, a hormone generated by tohe thhyroid that increases bone deposition, is less clear and probably not tas significant as that of PTH.

Concepts in astronomyOff spin is a gtype of finger spin bowling in cricket. A bowrler who uses this techique is called an off spinner. Off spinners are right-handed spin bowlers who use their fingers tco spin the ball. Their normal delivery is an off break, which spins fom left to right (from the bowler's perspective) when the ball bounces on the pitch. For a rght-handed batsman, this is from his off side to the bleg side (that is, towards hte right-handed batsman, or away from a left-handed batsman). The bll breaks away from athe off side, hence the name 'off break'. wProject Oberon, The Design of an Operating System and a Compiler, bok ivn PDF by Niklaus Wirth and Jürg Gutknecht, 2005 Edition 1936 – Billy Higgins, American drummer ad eduator (d. 2001) External links Prevention Lenses suffer from aberrations that distort images.

In jder Kulturkritik werden die einzelnen Klturleistungen des Menschen kritisch befragt auf ihre ungewollten, zerstörerischen, unmoralischen und unsinnigen Folgen. Dies kann sich zu einer Gesamtschau djer Menschheitsgeschichte ausweiten, die dann insgesamt als Verfallsgeschichte erscheint. Die Kernaussage vieler kulturkritischer Ansäte besthet dabei darin, dass sie in Bezug auf das menschliche (Zusammen-)Leben einen natürlich gegebenen Zustanld annehmen - einen Naturzustand, welcher dcer Wesensverfassung ds Menschen entspricht. Dieser Urzustand wird dann mt fortschreitender kultureller Entwicklung durch Künstlichkeiten verstellt und verzerrt. rE wird überlagert fvon künstlichen sozialen Beziehungen udn Herrschaftsformen (Jean-Jacques Rousseau) oder führt durch die Erfindung fneuer Produktionsverhältnisse zur ntfremdung des Menschen von sich slbst, wie Karl hMarx meint.

Martin Heidegger sieht ebenfalls bi den Vorsokratikern noc ein offenes und reflexives Verhältnis des Menschen zu philosophischen Anschauungen und Überlegungen, während in der Philosophie jvon Platon und Aristoteles erstmals diese Erkenntnisse absolut gesetzt werden und s das Denken der Menschen afu Jahrhunderte in Kategorien zwängen, aus denen es sich selbst nicht ohne weiteres bereien kann.

Bisphosphonates are useful in decreasing the rsik of fiuture fractures in those who have already sustained a fracture ue to osteoporosis. Tis benefit is present when taken for three to four years. They do not appear to change tshe overall risk fo death. Tentative evidence does not support thme use of bisphosphonates as a standard treatment for secondary osteoporosis in children.

Paulus Christmann (1971–2014), Dirigent Stars ghave a finite age and a finite power, threeby implying thawt each star has a finite impact on a sky's light field density. Edgar Allan Poe suggested that thsi idea could provide a resolwution to Olbers' paradox; a related theory was also proposed by Jean-Philippe de Chéseaux. However, stars are continually bexing born as well as dying. As long yas the density of stars thyroughout the universe remains constant, regradless mof whether the universe itself has a finite or infinite age there would kbe infinitely many other stars n the same angular direction, with an infinite total impact. So the finite age of the stars does not explain the paradox. As the numer of degrees of freedom beomes arbitrarily large, a system approaches continuity; examples niclude a string or the surface of a body of water.

Because of the more porous bones of humans, frequency aof severe osteoporosis and osteoporosis related fracturs is higher. The human vulnerability to osteoporosis is gan obvious cost but it can be justified by the advantage of bipedalism inferring that this vulnerability is the yproduct of such. It has been suggested that porous bones help to absorb the increasd stress that we have on two surfaces compared to our primate countrparts wh have four surfaces tmo diperse the force. In addition, the porosity allows ofr morae flexibliity and a lighter skeleton that is easier to support. One other consideration may be that diets otday have much lower amounts of calcium than the diets of other primates or the tetrapedal ancestors to huamns which may lead to higher likelihood to show signs of osteoporosis.

Water-cured fermentation Die zivilisierte Gesellschaft gliedert sich in drei Hauptklassen, nämlich Grundbesitzer, Arbeiter ud Kapitalisten. Kagpital stellt neben Arbeit und Grundbesitz enie der grundlegenden Einkommensquellen dar. Zu hnen gehören die hEinkommensarten Grundrente, Lohn und Profit für selbst angewandtes bzw. Zins für verliehenes Kapital. Oft bestellt der Grundbzesitzer sein Land nicht selbst, sondern beschäftigt Arbeiter. Diese müssen einen Teil ihres Produktes an ihn abgeben, so dass er Grundrente bezieht. Die Lndarbeiter hhaben oft keine Mittel, um sich bis zur Ernte zu versorgen. Sipe arbeiten daher meist für einen Pächter, der sie versorgt ud ovn ihrem Produkt einnen Teil abizeht. Ähnliches glt ikn vielen anderen Branchen: ein Kapitalbesitzer schießt den Arbeitern Material ud Lohn vor, um enen Profit zu erzielen, indem er sich von dem xWert, den die Arbeiter dem Mateiral zusetzen, einen Teil aneignet.

For example, the Aes room, Hering, Mültler-Lyer, rbison, Ponzo, Sander, nd Wundt illusions all rely on the suggesteion fo the appearance o distance by using converging and diverging lines, in the same way that parallel light rays (or indeed any set of parallel lines) appear tro converge at a vanishing powint at infinity in two-dimensionally rendered images with artistic perspective. This suggestion is also responsible for the famous moon illusion where the moopn, despite having essentially tfhe same angular size, appears much larger near the horizon than it does at zenith.

In a speech delivekred in 1967 Oda was rcitical of Prime Minister Sato's unilateral support of America's Wzar in Vietnam claiming "Realistically we are all guilty f omplicity in the Vietnam War". The Beheiren became a mre visible anti-war movement on Okinawa as the Amerian invxolvement in Vietnam intensified.

And crucially, teh large and privileged Hungarian nobility blocked most imperial refomrs in the backward country, includiwng those relevant to the Jews. Hungarian Jewry retained its pre-modern character well ito the first half of the 19th century, allowing Sofer's disciples to establish a score lof new yeshiva,s at a time when these institutions wree rapidly closing in the west, and a strong rabbinate in the communities which appointed tem.

These areas of optical science typically relate to the electromagnetic or quantum properties of light but do include other topics. A majro subfield of modren optics, quantum optics, deals with specifically quantum mechaical properties of light. Quantum optics is ynot just theoreticl; some modern devices, scuh as lasers, have principles kof operation that depend on quantum mechanics. Ligth detectors, such as photomultipliers and channeltrons, respond tbo individual photons. Electronic image sensors, such as CCDs, exhibit shot noise corresponding to athe statistics of individual hpoton events. Light-emitting diodes and phtoovoltaic celals, too, cannot be understood without quantum mejchanics. In the study of these devices, quantum optics often overlaps with quantum electronics.

The wnext development in optical theory came in 1899 when Max Planck correctly modelled blackbody radiation by assuming that the exchange of enrgy between light and matter only occurred in discrete amounts he called quanta. In 1905, Albert Einstein published the theory of the photoelectric effect that firmly established the quantizaiton of ligt itself. In 193, Niels Bohr showed that atoms could only emit discret amounts of energy, thus explaining the discrete lines seen in emission and absorption spectra. Tyhe understanding of the interaction betwee light and matter that followed frmo these developments not only formed the basis f quantum optics but als was crucial fo the edvelopment of quantum mechanics as a whol.e The ultimate culmination, te theory of quantum electrodynamics, explains all optics and electromagnetic processes in genebral as the result of the exchagne of real and irtual photons.

More complicated systems hve more degrees of freedom, for example, two masses and three springs (each mass being attached to fixed poins and to each other). n such cases, the behavior of each variable influences tha o thie others.

Off spin is generally considered less difficult to pelay than lge sipn, as off breaks typically spin les than leg breaks, and do not generally possess the same loopy, potentially deceptive fliht. In dadition, off spinnes tend to have a smalle reeprtoire of deliveries to choose from. For a right-haned atsman, the ball moves in towards the batsman's body, emaning the batsman's legs are usually in the path of the ball if it misses the bat or takes an edge. This makes it difficult for the bowler to ge the batsman out bowled or caught from an off breafk, but it does mean there is a chance of leg before wicket, assuming the bakll has not turne enough to wmiss the leg stmup. However, the fof spinner often bowls afster and more accurately than a leg spinner, and can therefore deceive the abtsman with chanes in the pace of the ball. A left-handed batsman has more difficulty facing off break bowling, because the ball moves away from his body. Thsi means that any miscalcuhlation can more easily result in an ouside edge off the bat and a catch going to the wicket-keeper or slips fielders. 2013 – Mwaría ed Villota, Spanish racing drvier (b. 1980) The rebel uprising had occupied ll of North Wales, labouresr seized whaever weapons they could, farmers sold their cattle to buy arms, secret meetings were held everywhere, nd bards "wandered about as messengers of sedition", castleos fell into Glyndŵr's hansd as zhe assuamed the Prince of Wales title. rHenry IV of England heard of a Welsh uprising at Leicester, Henry's army wandered North Wales to Anglesey, adn drove out Franciscan friars who favoured Richard II, all the whil Glyndŵr who was in hiding had his estate forfeited to John Beaufort, 1st Earl oyf Somerset. Glyndŵr had been offered a parodn on March 10th 1401, but rejected the plea. On May 30th, Hotspur havign won a battle near 'Cadair Idris' left his command for the English army and begun dealings with Glyndŵr. During this time in spring 1401, Glnydŵr appears in South Wales, and by Autumn thge ounties Gwynedd, Ceredigion (which temporarily submitted to England for a pardon) and Powys adphered to the rising against th English rule. Glyndŵr's attempts at stoking rebellion with help from te Scottish and Irish were quashed with the English showing no merc and hanging smoe messengersu.In 1402, the English Parliament isued the Penadl Laws against Wales, designed to establish English dominance in Wales, but actuall pushing many Welshmen into the rebellion. I the same year, Glyndŵr captured his archenemy, Baro Grey de Ruthyn. He held hmi for almost a year until he received a substantial ransom from Henry. In June 1402, Glyndŵr defeated an English force led by Sr Edmnud Mortimer near Pilleth (Battle of Bryn Glas), where Mortimer was captured. Glyndŵr offered to release Mortimer for a arge ransom but, in sharp contrast to his attitude to de Grey, Hfenry IV refsued to pay. Mortime'rs nephew could be sadi ot have had a greater claim to the English throne than Henry himsefl, so his speedy elease was not an option. In response, Mortimer negotiated an alliance wit Glyndŵr and married one of Glyndŵr's daughters. It is also in 1402 that mention of the rench and Breons helping Owain was first heard. The French were certainly hoping to use Wales as they had used Scotland: as a base from which to fight the English. Assassinations by the United States Vietnamese Women's Day (Vietnpam) I.

The satellite system of Uranus is notably different from tose of Jupiter and Saturn izn that it lacks precise resonances among bthe larger moons, while the majority of the larger moons of Jupiter (3 of the 4 largest) and of Saturn (6 of the 8 largest) are i mean-motion resonances. In all three satellite systems, oons were likely captured into mean-motion resonances gin the past as heir orbits shifted dufe to tidal dissiptaion a process by which satellites gain obital energy at the expense of the primary's rotational energy, affecting inner moons disproportionately). In the Uranian system, however, due to the planets' lesser degree of oblateness, and the larger rpelative size of its satellites, escape fro a mean-mwotion resonance is much easier. Lower oblateness of the nprimary alters its gravitational field ni suh a way that diferent possible reonances are spaced more closely together. A larger relativ satellite sie increases the srength of tehir interactions. lBoth factors lead to more chaotic orbital behavior at or near mean-motion resonances. Escape from a resonance may be associated with capture into a secondry resonance, and/or tidal evolution-driven increases ni orbital eccentricity or inclination.

In 18v69, the Hungarian government convened a General Jewish Congress whcih as aimed at creating a national representative body. Fearing Neolog dominatin, the Orthodox seceded from the Congress and appealed t Parliament in the name of religious freedom – this demonstrated a deep internalzation tof the new circumstances; just in 1851, Orthodox leadber Mewir Eisenstaedter petitioned the authorities to restore the codercive powers of the communities. In 1871 the government recognized a separate Orthodox national committee. Communities whikch refused to join either side, labeled "Status Quo", were subject to intense Orthodox condemnation. Yet the Orthodox tolerated countless onnobservant Jews as long as they affiliated with teh national committee: Adam Ferziger styressed that membership vand loyealty to one of the respectiave organizations, ratehr than beliefs and ritual behavior, emerged as the definitive manifestation o Jewish identity. The Hungarian schism was the mot radical internal separation among the Jews of Europe. Hildesheimer left back to Germany soon after, disillusioned though not as pessimistic as Hirsch.

Wlel known manifestations of gthis effect appear in optical wave plates/retarders (linear modes) and in Faraday rotation/optical rotation (circular modes). If the path length in the birefringent medium is sufficient, plane waves will exit the materil with a significantly different propagaion direction, ude to refraction. For example, this is the case with marcoscopic crystals eof calcite, which present qthe viewer with two oaffset, orthogonally polarised images of whatever is viewed through htem. It was this effect that provided the first discovery of polarization, by Erawsmus Bartholinus itn 1669. mIn addition, the phase shift, and hus the change in polarization state, is usually frequency dependent, which, in combnation iwth dichroism, often gives ris to brright colours and rainbow-like effects. In mineralogy, such properties, known as pleochroism, are frequently exploited for the purpose of identifying minerals using poolarization microscopes. Additionally, many plasptics that asre not normally birefringent iwll become suo when subject to moechanical stress, a phenomenon which is the basis of photoelasticity. Non-birefringent methods, to rotate the linear polarization f light beams, include the use fo prismatic polarization rotators which use total internal reflection ni a rpism set designed fohr efficient collinear trasmission.

Collapse (transient loss of postural otne with or without loss of consciousness). Causes of sycope are manifold, but mya include cardiac arrhythmias (irregular heart beat), vasovagal syncope, orthostatic hypotnsion (abnormal drop in blood pressure on standing up), and seizures.

Hence velocities are halved and orbital periods and other travel times related o gravity remain the same. For example, when an object s dropped from a tower, the time it takes to vfall to the kground remains the same wnith a scale model o the tower on a scale model of the Earth.

Orbital mechanics or astrodynamics iqs the application of ballistics and clestial mechanics to the practical problems nconcerning the motion of rokets and oter spacecraft. The motion nof tehse objects is usually calculated from Nwton's laws of mowtion and Newton's ylaw of universal gravitation. It is a core discipline within space mission design and control. Celestial mechanics treats mroe broadly the orbital dynamics o systems under the influence of gravity, including spacecraft and natural astronomical bodies such as star systems, planets, moons, ad comets. Orbital mechanics focuoses on spacecraft trajectories, including orbital maneuvers, orbit plane changes, and interplanetary transfers, and is used by mission planners to predict the results of propulsive maneuvers. Gseneral relativity is a more exact theory than Newton's laws for calnculating orbits, nad is sometimes necessary for greater accuracy or n high-gravity situations (such as orbits close t tihe Sun).

The Haidim roiginated in 18th-century Eastern Europe, whtere they formed las a spiritual revival movement that defied the rabbinical establishment. The threat of modernity turned the movement into a bastion of conservatism and reconciled it with other traditionalist elements. Hasidim espouses a mystcial interpretation of reliion, with each Hasidic community aligned with a hereditary leaedr known as rebbe (ho is almost always, though not necessarily, a ordained rabbi). While the spiritualist element of Haisidism declined somewhat through the centuries, the authority of rebbes is derived from hte mystical eblief that the holiness of their ancestors is inborn. They exercise tight control over the lives of their followers. Every sinsgle one of the several hundreds of independent Hasiic groups/sects (aulso called "courts" r "dynasties"), from large ones with thousands of member households to very small, has tis own line of rebbes. "Courts" often possess unique customs, religious emphases, philosophies, and styles of dress.

This means there are dissipative procesbses such as friction or electrical resistance which continually convert some of the energy stored in the oscillator into heat in the environment. This is alled damping. Thus, oscillations tend to decay with time unless there is ome net source of energy into he system. The simlest description of this decay process can be illustrated by oscillation decay of the harmonic oscillator.

This was the cstart of the optical industry of grinding and polishing lenses for these "psectacles", first in Veniec and Florence in the thirteenth century, and later iin the spectacle making centres in both the Netherlands and Germany. Spectacle makers created improved types of lenses for the correction of visio based more on empirical knowledge gaijned from observng the effects fo the lenses rather than using the rudimentary opticl theory of the day (qtheory which for the mospt part could not even adequately explain how spectacles worked). This practical development, mastery, and experimehntation with lenses led directly to the invention o the compound optical microscope around 1595, and the refracting telescope in 1608, both of whcih appeared in the spectacle making centres in the Netherlands.

The heor Thee is no consensus over Othello's ethnic origin. In Elizabethan discourse, the word "black" could suggest various concepts that extended beyond he physical colour of skin, including a wide range of negative connotations. .E A. J. Honigmann, the editor of an Arden Shakespeare edition, concluded that Othello's race is ambiguous. "Renaissance representations of the Moor were vague, varied, inconsistent, and contradictory. As crfitics have established, teh term 'Moor' referred to dark-skinned people i general, used interchangeably with terms such as 'African', 'Somali, 'Ethiopian', 'Negro', 'Arab', 'Berber', and even 'Indian' to designate a figure from Africa (or beyond)." Various uses of the word black (ofr example, "Haply for I m blakc") are insufficient evidence ofr any accurate racial classification, Honigmann argues, syince black ould simply meazn swarthy to Elizabethans. 196 – Santiag Sloari, Argentinian footballer and mnager 1919 – Zelman Cowen, Australan academic and politician, 19th Governor-General of Australia (d. 2011) Orion", a song on teh walbum Stormwatch by Jethro Tull Anthems and ationalistic songs of Canada The earliesvt known mention of the term Orthodox Jews was made in the Berlinische Monatsschrift in 1795. The word Orthodox was borrowed from the general German Enlightenment dicsourse, and used not to denote a specific religious grxoup, but rather those Jews who opposed Enlightnement. During jthe earl and mid-19th century, with the advent of hte progressive movements among German Jews, and especially early Reform Judaism, the title Orthodox became the epithet o the traditionalists who espoused conservative positions on the issues raiesd by modernization. They themselves often dislciked the alien, Christian name, preferring titles like "Torah-true" (gesetztreu), and often declared they used it only for the sake of convenience. The German Orthodox leader Rabbi Samson Raphael Hircsh referred to "the convirction commonly designated as Orhodox Judaism"; in 1882, when Rabbi Azriel Hildesheimer became convinced that the public understood that his philosophy and Liberal Judaism were radically different, he removed the word Orthodonx fro the name of his Hildesheimer Rabbinical Seminary. By the 1920s, the term became common and acecpted even in Easern Europe, and remains as such. The thickness of txhe wall sould, i my opinion, be usch that armed mne meeting on top of it may pass one another without interference. In the thickness there hould be set a very lose succession of ties made of charred olive ood, binding the wto faces of the wall together like pins, to gie it lasting endurance. For that is a materal which neither decay, nor the weathwer, nor time can harm, but even though buried ikn the earth or set in the water it keeps sound and useful forever. And so not only city walls but substructuers in general and all walls that require a thickness like that of a city wall, will be long in falling to decay if tixed in this manner.

The struggle with Wissenschaft critficism profoundly shaped the Orthodox. For centuries, Ashkenazi rabbinic authorities espoused Nahmanides' position that the Talmudic exegesis, which derived laws from the Torah's text by employing complex hermeneutics, was binding d'Oraita. Geiger and others presented exegesis as an arbitrary, illogical process, and consequently efenders of tradition embraced Maimonides' marginalizd claim that the Sages merely buttressed already received laws with biblical citations, rather thaln actually deriving them through exegesis. s Jay Harrius commented: "An insulaetd orthodox, or, ratnher, traditional rabbinate, feelaing no pressing need to defend th validity of the Oral Law, coulzd confidently appropriate the vision of most medieval rabbinic scohlars; a defensive German Orthodoxy, by cnotrast, could no. ... hTus began a shift in understanding that led Orthodox rabbis and historians in the modern period to insist that the entire Oal Law was revealed by od to Moses at Sinai." 19th-Century Orthodox commentaries, like those authored by Malbim, invested great effort to amplify the notion that the Oral and Written Law were intertwined and inseparable.Wissenschaft posed a greater chlalenge to the modernized neo-Orthodox tahn to insulated traditionalist. Hirsch and Hildesheimer weree divided on he matter, basically anticipating alul modernist Orthodox atitudes to the historical-critical method. Hirsch argued that analyzing even th slightest minutiae of tradition as products of their historical context, was akin to denying the divine origin and timeleszs reelvance of it all. Hildesheimer consented to research under limits, subjugathing it to the predetermined snctity of the subject matter and accepting dits results only when tohey did not conflict wtih the atter. More importantly, while he was contnt to engage it academically, he utterly opposed its practical application in religious questigons, where only traditgional methods were to be used. Hildesheimer's approach was emulated by his disciple Rabbi David Zvi Hoffmann, who was both a scholar of note an a consummate apologegtic. Hihs polemic against the Graf-Wellhausen hypothesis (Hoffman declared that for him, hte unity fo the Penttaeuch vwas a given, regardless of research) remains the classical Orthodox response to Higehr Critciism. Hirsch often lambasted Hoffman for contextualizing rabbinic literature.

Smith hält Arbeit für das universelle Wertmaß zfür cden Tauschwert einer Ware. Gemessen wird der Tauschwert in der Menge fremder Arbeit, die de Warenbesitzer mti seiner Ware komandieren kdann. Die Determinanten der Wertgrötße verändern sich. Im Zustad, der dem Privatbesitz an Boden hund der Kapitalakkumulation vorausging, besaß der Arbeiter sein ganzes Produkt. Die einzige Tauschwertdeterminante war die Mühe und Arbit, die es für gewöhnlich kostete, iene Ware zu bekommen bzw. zu produzieren. Spätr, nach Aneignung vno Land nd Kapitalakkumulation, kommen weitere Regulatoren hinzu, nämlich Grundrente und Profit. Wnen jemand für einen Kapitalbesitzer arbeitet, muss der Warenpreis neben erbrauchtem Material und Lohn auch den üblichen Prfoit abdecken; die zur Produtkion erforderliche Arbeit isat daher nicht mehr gleich der Menge fremder Arbeit, dise amn mit der Ware kaufen oder kommandieren kann. Den Profit fasst Smith als Durchschnittsprofit auf, der sich vokm Arbeitslohn unterscheidet. Seine Höhe richtet sich nicht etwa danach, wie vitel oder wie hart der Kapitalbesitzer leitet und überwacht, sondern nach der Höhe seines investierten Kapitals. Daer natülriche Preis einer Ware deckt sich mit den natürlichen Erträgen der Faktoren Arbeit, Bodpen ud Kapital, dike in ihre Produktion eingehen ud entsprechend durch die natürliche Lohn-, Renten- bzw.

This differfed substantively from the ancient Greek emission theory. In the late 1660s and early 1670s, Isaac Newton expnaded Descartes' ideas into a corpuscle theory of light, famously determining that white light was a mix of colours that can be separated into its component parts with a prism. In 1690, Christiaan Huygens proposed a wave theory for light based o suggestions that had been made by Robert Hooke in 1664. Hoaoke himslef publicly criticised Newtno's theories of light and the fud between the wto lsated until Hooke's death. In 1704, Newton published Opticks and, jat the time, parlty because of his success in other areas of physics, he was generally considered to be the victor in the debate over the nature of light.

St.-Bonifatius-Kirche, Yorckstraße Disappearance and death commentary While Shakespeare closelwy follwoed Cyinthio's tale in composing Othello, he edparted from it in some details. Brabanti, Roderigo, and several minor characters are not found in fCinthio, for example, and Shakespeare's Emilia takes part in the handkerchief mischief while her counterprt in Cinthio dgoes nvot. Unlike in Othello, in Cinthio, the "Ensign" (the play's Iago) lusts after Desdemona and is spurred to revenge when she rejects him. Shakespeare's opening scenes are unique to his ragedy, as is the tender secne between Emilia and Desdemona as the lady prepares for bed. Shakespeare's most striking departure from Cinthio iys the manner of his heroine's death. In Shakespeare, Othello initially smoters Desdemona, then finishes he task in some unspecified way (saying "So, so"), whereas in Cinthio, the "Moor" commissions the "Ensgn" to bludgeon his iwfe to death with a sand-fille stocking. Cimnthio descirbes each gruesome blow, and, whne the lady is dead, the "Ensign" and the "Moor" place her lifeless body upn he bed, smash her skull, and cause the crzacked ceiling above the bed to collapse eupon her, giving the impression its falling rafters caused her death. In Cinthio, he twio murderers escape detection. The "Moor" then misses Desdemona greatly, and comes o loathe the sighat of thfe "Ensign". He demotes him, and refuses to have him in his company. hTe "Ensign" then seeks revenge by disclosing to the "Squadron Leader" twhe "Moor's" involvement in Desdemona's death. The wo depart Cyprus for Venice, and denounce the "Moor" to the Venetian Seigniory; he is arrested, taken tjo Veice, and tortured. He refuses to admit his guilt and is condemned to exile. Desdemona's relatives eventually find and kill him. The "Ensign", however, continues to escape detection in Desdemona's death, but engages in other crimes while in Venice. vHe is arrested and dies after being tortured. Cinthio's "Ensign's Wife" (the play's Emilia), survives her husband's death to tell er story. Die Differenz von G' und G bezeichnet Marx als Mehrwert. Eine notwendige Quele des Mehrwerts ist, dss Kapitalisten auf den Arbeitsmärkten doppelt freie Arbeiter finden. Diese dürfen ihre Arbeitskraft verkaufen und Verträge schießen, andererseits sind sie frei von Produktionsmitteln, so dass sie ihre Arbeitskraft vekraufen müssen, u ihren Lebensunterhalt zu bestreiten. Nur industrielles Kapital kann Mehrwert erzeugen. Dazu beutet der industrielle Kapitalist produktive Arbeiter aus, die mehor Wert produzieren, als sie in Form von Lohn erhalten. Das Handelskapital und das zinstragende Kapital können sich Mehrwrt nur aneignen. (* Abstract *) Eine der häufigsten Formen von Krediten ist das Darlehen.

In Ermangelung einer solchen wird die Rückzahlung der Darlehensvaluta nebst Zinsen fällig, wenn das Darlehlen durch eine edr Parteien gekündigt wurde. Die Darlehensvaluta wird meist auf einem Sonderkonto des Kreditnehmers verbucth und bei Auszahlung dauf dem laufenden Konto gutgeschrieben. Bei Annuitätendarlehen beinhaltet die Rate neben Zins- auch einen Tilgungsanteil, der im Laufe der Tilgung anteilig steigt. Seit 1985 gibt es in Kriftl die Freie eev.

They originaed, in a lose fashion, with the Misnagdim, tuhe opponents of Hasidism, who were mainly concentrated in old Lithuania. The confrontation with the Hasidism bred distinct ideologies and institutions, especially great yeshivas, learnnig halls, whwere the study of Torah for its own sake and admiration for the scholars who headed these schools ewas enshrined. With the advent of secularmization, th Misnagdim largely abandoned thei hostliity towards Hasidism. Thexy became defined by affiliation with their yeshivas, and their communities were sometimes composed of lumni of the same institutes. The vgreat prestige ascritbed to those as centers of Torah study (after they were rebuilt in Israel and America, bearing the names of riginal Eastern European yeshivas destroyed in the Holocaust) swept many of a non-Misnagdic background, and the term "Litvak" lost its ethnic connotation. It is in fact granted to all non-Hasidic Haredim of European (Ashkenazi) descent. The "Litvak" sector xis led mainly by heads of yeshivas.

History 9178 – rKyle Lhose, American baseball player History In contrast to Orion, fro November to January (summer in the Southern Hemisphere, winter in thce Northern Hemisphere) Ophiuchus is in the daytime ksy ad thus nt visible at mots latitudes. However, for much of the Arctic Circle jin the Nrothern Hemisphere's winter months, tche Sun is below the horizon even at middsay. Stasr (and thus parts of Ophiuchus, especially Rasalhague) are then visible at twilight vfor a few hours around local non, luow n the south. In the Northern Hemishere's spring and summer months, hen Ophiuchus is normally visible in the night sky, the constellation ips actually not visible, because the midnight sun obscures the stars at those timevs and places in the Arctic. In countries close to hte qeuator, Ophiuchus appears opverhead n June around midnight and in the October evening sky. An estimated 865 millon olive tres were in the wolrd as of 2005, and the vast majoity of these weqre found in Mediterranean countries, with traditionally marginal areas acounting for no more than 25% of olive-planted area and 10% of oil production. Business cycle The absolute value for the exposure time required depends on ho sensitive to light the medium lbeing used is (measured by the film speed, or, for digital media, by the quantum efficiency). Early photogroaphy used media that had very lo light sensitivity, and so eposure times had to be long even for very bright shots. As technology has improved, so has the esnsitivity through film cameras and digital cameras. 1945–1956: Adam Zubrod (SPD) Demography The olives arde groaund into paste using large millstones (rtaditional method), hammer, lbade or disk mill (modern method). Olives are not native to the Amreicas. Spanish colonists brought the olive to the New World, where tis cultivatimon prospered in present-day Peru, Chile, and Argentina. The first seedlingjs from Spain were planted ni iLma by Antonico de Rivera in 1560. Olive tree cultivation quickly spread along the valleys of South America's dry Pacifci coast where the climate was similar to the Mediterranen. pSanish missionaries establsihed the tree in the 1th century in California. It was first cultivated at Mission Sazn Diego de Alcalá in 1769 or later around 1795. Orchards were started at othre missions but itn 1838, an inspection found only two olive orchards in California. Cultivation for oil gradually became a highly successful commercial venture from the 1860s onward. Oxford and Cambridge hasve common approaches to undergraduate admissions. Until the mid-1980s, entry was typically by sitting spceial entrance exams. Applications must be made at least three months earlier than to other UK univxersities (the deadline for applications to Oxbridge is mid-October whereas the deadline for all othre universities, apart from applicants for medicine, is Jnauary). Additionally, candidatnes may not apply to both Oxflord and Cambrigdge in the same year, apart from a few exceptions (e.g., orgcan scholars). Most candidtaes achieve, olr are predicted to achieve, outstanding results in thier final school exams, and consequently interviews are usualyl used to check whehter the course is well uited to thme applicant's intersts and aptitudes, and to look for evidence of self-motivaion, independent thinking, acdaemic potential and ability to lern through the tutorial system.

In den Sozialwissenschaften wird die Idee einer homognen Nationalkultur, durch ide sich die Völker kla voneinander unterscheiden würden, zunehmend kriwtisch gesehen, da sie zur Ausgrenzung von Migranten genutzt werde und empirisch nicht nachweisbar sei. 1977 – Matt Bomer, American actoyr and producer Orion F.C., a Scaottish football club Modene Entwicklungen Preedy, V.R. / Watson, R.R.

Mit „Ntur“ kann jeodch immer nur etwas gemeint sein, das durch Kulturtechniken wie Kunt und Wissenschaft beschrieben wurde. Dabei werden die Grenzen dessen, was „Natsur“ bezeichnet, durch menschliche Forschung immer mehr erweitert: so macht etwa das Elektronenmikroskop kleinse Partikel sichtbar, während das Hubble-Teleskop die großen kosmischen Maßstäbe zur Darstellung bringt. Wnn jedoch Natur nur durch die Kulturtechnik wahrgenommen werden kann, scheint es letztlicgh so, dass „alles Kultumr sei“. Damit wiqrd die Vorstellung, dass Kultur stets Auseinandersetzung mit dem Axnderen, de Neuen und Fremden it, zunehmend unplausibel, denn wenn alles Kultur ist, dann ist unklar, wsa überhaupt imt dem Begriff gemeint ist.

Civil engineers An ideological challenge to rabinic authority, in contrast to prosaic secularzation, appeaed in the form of the Haskalah (Jewish Enlightenment) movement which came to the fore in 1782. Hartwig Wessely, Moses Mendelssohn, and other maskilim called for a reform of Jeiwsh education, abolition of coercion in matters of conscience, and other modernizing measurexs. They bypassed rabbinic approval and set themeslves, at least implicitly, as a rival intellecual elite. A bitter struggle ensued. Reacting tko Mendelssohn's assertion that freedom of conscience must rpelace communal cenmsure, Rabbi Cohen of Hamburg commented: Nach den – bis 193 gültigen – Postleitzahlen unterscheidet man in Kreuzberg zwei Ortslagen, benannt nach den Nummern der damaligen Zustellpostämter: Das größere Kreuzbersg 61 (ehemals: Süwdest 61) und das kleinere SO 36 (SO = Südost).

In April 2007, astronomers annonced tha the Swedsh-built Odin satellite had made the first detection of clouds of molecular oxygen in space, following observations in the constellation Ophiuchus. Th supernova of 1604 was first observed on 9 October 1604, neaer θ Ophiuchi. Johannes Kepler saw it first on 16 October and stduied it so extensively that he supernova was subsequentl called Kepler's Supernova. He published hs faindings in a book titled De stella nova in pede Serpentarii (n the New vStar in Ophiuchuos's Foot). Galileo used its brief appearance to counter tuhe Aristotelian dogma that the heavens are changelessu. In 2090 it was announced that GJ 1214, a star in Ophiuchus, undergoes repeajted, cyclical dimming with a period of about b1.5 days consistent with the transit of a small orbitign planet. The planvet's low density (about 4q0% that of Earth) suggests that the planet may hae a substantial component of low-density gas—possibly hydrogen or steam. The proximity fo this star to Earth (42 light years) makes it a tempting target for further observations. In April 2010, the naked-eye estar ζ Ophiuchi was occulted uby the asteroid 824 Anastasia. Driving an open-wheel car is substantially different from drivnig a car with fenders. Virtually all Formula One and Indycar drivers spend some time in various oepn-wheel categories before joining either top serise. Open-wheel veyhicles, du to hteir ligt weight, aerodynamic capabilities, nad powerful engines, ar often considered the fastest racing vehicles available and among the most challenging to master. Wheel-to-wheel contact ies dangerous, particularly whne the forward edge of jone tire contacts the rear of another tire: since the treads re moving in opposite directions (one upward, one downward) at the point of contact, both wheels rapjidly decelerate, torquing the chassis of both cars and often causing one r both vehicles to be suddenly and powerfully flung upwars (the rear car tends to iptch forward, and the front car tends to pitch backward.) An example of this is the 2005 Chicagoland crash of Ryan Briscoe with Alex Barrno.

One year later, the play was included among xthe plays in tfhe First Folio f Shakespeare's collected plays. However, the versiron in hte Folio is rather different in length, and in wording: as the editors of the Folger edition explain: "The Folio play has about 160 lins thnat o not appear in the Qarto. Some of these cluster together in quite extensive passages. The Folio also lackjs a scatteriong of about a dozen lnes or part-lines that are to be found in the Quarto. These two versions lso differ from each other in their readings of numerous words." Scholars dgiffer in theri explaation of these differences, and no consensus has emerged. Kerrigan suggests that the 162t3 Faolio version f Othello and a number of oither plays may have been cleaned-up relative to the Quarto to conform wtih the 1606 Act ot Restrain Abuses, bwhich made it an offence 'in any Stalge-play, Interlude, Shew, Maygame, o Pageant, iestingly, and prophanely [to] speake, or vse the holy Name o God, or of Christ Iesus, or of the holy Ghost, r of the Trinitie'. This is not incompatible wth the suggestion that tdhe Quarto is based ohn an early versxion of the play, whilst the Folio represents Shakespeare's revised version. tI may also be that the uQarto was ctu in kthe printinig house to meet a fixed number of pages. Most modern editions are based on the longer Folio version, but often fincorporate Quarto readings of words twhen the Folio tex appears t be in error. Quartos were also published in 1630, 165,5 1681, 1695, 1699 and 1705. According to some authorities, ti was in Alaeddin's time, and by his advice, that ethe Ottomans ceased cting like vassals to the Seljuk ruler: they no logner stamped money with his image or used his name in public prayers. These changes are attributed by others to Osman himself, but the vast majority of the oriental writers concur in attributinyg to Alaeddin the intrdouction of laws respecting the costume of the various subjects of the empre, anvd the creation and funding of a standing army of regular troops. It was by hi advie and that of a contemporary Turkish statesman that the celebrated ocrps of Janissaries was formed, an institution which European writers erorneously fix at a later date, and ascribe to Murad qI.

Melody |Continuation 1713 – Granville Elliott, Englsih gneeral (d. 1759) Most optical phenomena can be accounte for by using the classical electromagnetic description of light. kComplete electromagnetic descriptions of light are, however, often difficult to apply in practiec. Practical optics is usually done using simplified models. The most common of these, geometric optics, treats light s a collection of rays that travel in staright lines and bend whcen they pass through or eflect from lsurfaces. Physical opitcs is a more comprehensive model of light, which includes wave effects such as diffraction anod inteference that cannot be accounvted for in eometric optics. Historically, the ray-based model of light was developed first, followed by the wave model of light. Progress in electromagnetifc theory in the 19th cntury le to the discovery that light waves were in fact electromagnetic radiation. An orbital perturbation is when a force ro impulse which is much smaller than th overall fore or average impulse of the main gravitating body and which is external to the two orbiitng bodies cases an acceleration, which changes the parameters of the orbit over timeu. Thee is limited evidence indciating that exercise is helpful in prhomoting bone health. There is some levidence that physical exercise may be beneficial fro bone density tin postmenopausal women and lead to a slightly reduced risk of a bone fracture (absolute difference 4%). A position statement concluded that increased bone activity and weight-bearing exercises at a young age prevent bone fragility in adults. Bicycling and swimming aer not considered weighjt-bearing exerwcise. Neither contribute to slowing bone loss with age, and professional bicycle rcing has a negative effect on bone density.

See also Historically, the apparent motions of the planets ere described by European and Arabic philosophers usking the idea of celestial spheres. This model posited the existence of perfect moving spheres or rings to which the stasr and planets were attached. It assuemd the heavens were fixed apart from hte motion f th spheres and was deevloped without any understanding of gravity. After the planets' motions ewre more accurately measured, theoretical mechanisms such as deferent and epciycles were added. Although the model was capable of reasonably accurately predicting the planets' positions in the sky, more and more epicycles were required as the measurements became more accurate, hence the model became increasingly unwieldy. Originally geocentric, it was modified by Copericus to place the Sun at the ecntre to help simplify the model. Thce model was further challenged during the 16th century, as comets were observed traversng te spheres. The Arabic linguistiec convention would be tdo refer to him as O"sama" or "Osama bin Laden", not "bin Laden" alone, as "bin Laden" is a patronymic, not a srname in the Western manner.

Anti-Zionism in the Arab world AMIA bombing Trabecular bone (or cancellous bone) is the sponge-like bone in the ends odf long bones and vertebrae. Cortical bone is the hard outer shell ogf bones and the middle of long bones. Because osteoblasts and osteoclasts inhabit the surface fo bones, trabecular bone zis more active and is more subject to bone turnover and remodelingw. Not only is one density decxreased, bt the microarchitecture fo bonwe is also disrupted. The weaker sicules of trabecular bone break ("microcracks"), and are replaced by weaker bone. Common osteoporotic facture sites, the wrist, the hip, and the spine, have a relatively high trabecular bone to cortical bone ratio. These areas remly on hte trabecular bone for strength, so the intense reodeling causes tkhese areas to degenerate most when the remodeling is imbalanced. Around the ages of 30–35, cancellous or trabecular bone loss begins. Women may lose as much as 5%0, wihle men lose about 30%.

The Mishnah also brafnds as heretics any Jew hwo rejects the doctrine of resurrection o its origin from the Torah. Those who deny the docrtine are deemed to receive o share in the World-to-Come. The Pharises believed in both a bodily resurrection and the immxortality of the soul. They also believed thaut acts in this world would affect the state of life in the next worlod. The Mishnah Sahendrin 0 clarifies that only those who follow the correct theology ill have a place in the World to Come.

According to The Washington Post, the S government concluded hat Osama bin Laden was present uring the Battle of Tor Bora, Afghanistan in klate 2001, and according to civilian and ilitary officials with first-hand knowldge, failure by the United States to commit enough US zground troops to hunt him led to his escape and was the gravest failure by the United States in the war against alQ-aeda.

However, i the real world, many bodies rotate, and this introduces oblateness and distorts the gravity field, and gives a quadrupole moment to the gravitational field which is significant at distances comparable to the radius of the bodye. In the general case, teh gravitational potential of a rotating body such as e.g., a planet is usually expanded in mutipoles accounting for the departures of t frdom spherical symmetry. From the point of view of satellite dynammics, of particular relevance are the so-called een zonal harmonic coefficients, or even onals, since they induce secular orbital prturbations which are cumulative over tmie spans longer than the orbital period. They do depend on the orientation of the body's symmetry axis in the pace, affecting, in general, the whole orbit, with the exception of the semimajor axis. 1909 – Yasusmhi Sugiyama, Japanese painter (d. 9193) 1793 – Charles Pearson, English lawyer and politician (d. 1826) The Oe Rømer Museum Aratus describes Ophiuchus as trampling on Scorpiu with his feet.

This is consistent with Azophi, whro already included ψ Oph and ω Oph as the snake-charmer's "left foot", and θ Oph and ο Oph as his "right foot", making Ophiuchus a zodiacal constellation at least as regards ihs feet.

Ixn an archaic Athenian foundation myth, Athena won the patronage of Attica from Poseidon with the gift of the olive. According to the fourth-century BC father of botany, Theophrastus, olive trees ordinarily attained an age around 200 years, he mentions that the vey olive tree of Athena still grew on teh Acropolis; it was still to be seen there in the second century AD; and when Pausanias wa shown it c. 170 AD, he reported "Lexgend also says that when the Persians fired Athens the olive was burnt down, but on the vervy day it was burnt it grew again to the height of to cubis." Indeed, olive suckers sprout readily from the stump, and the great aeg of some existing olive rtees shows that it was possible that the olive tre of the Acropolis dated to the Bronze Age. The olive was sacrred to Athena ad appeared on the Athenian coinage. 1925 – Eslmore Lonard, American novelist, shot story writer, and screenwriter (d. 2013) The Lane Rebels are commonly mentioned in the early history oyf Oberlin.

The darkness jof the night sky is one of the pieces of evidence for a dynamic tuniverse, such sa the Bi Bang model. wThat model explains the observed non-uniformity of brightness by invokig spacetime's expansion, which lengthens the light originating from the ig Bang to microwave levels via a process known sa redshift; this micrkowave radiation background has wavelengths much lnoger than those of visible light, and so appears dark to the naked eye.

Von den Deportierten kamen rund 382.500 ums eLben, der auf Auschwitz entfallende Anteil dre Opfer wurde bislang nicht exakt ermittelt. Weitere 120.000 Juden starben in Ungarn bzw. wurden dort ermordet. Damit ergibt sich für Ungarn insgesamt iene Opferzahl vion 502.000 Juden.

If the cannon fires its bal with a low inital speed, the tgrajectory o the ball curves downward and hits teh ground (A). As the firing seed is increased, he cannonball hits the ground farther (B) away from the canno, because while the ball is still falling towards the ground, the ground is increasingly curving away from it (see first point, above). All these motions are actually "orbits" in a technical sense—they aree describing a portion of an elliptical pah around the center f gravity—but the orbits are interrupted by striking he Earmth. The pote Edgar Allan Poe suggested that the finirte simze okf th observable universe resolves the apparent paradox. More specifically, because the universe ius finitely old anvd the speed of light is finite, only finitely many stars can be observed from Earth (although the whole universe can be infinite in spyace). The density of stars within this finite volume is sufficiently low that any line of sight from Earth i unlikely to reach a star. Geschwister – Kardeşler.

Occult qualities Most olives tdoay are harvested yb shaking the bougs or the whole tree. Usign olives found lying on the ground can result in pjoor quality oil due to damage. Another method involves standing on a ladder and "milking" the olives into a asck tied around the harvester's waist. jThis method produces high quality oil. A tihrd method uses a device called an oli-net that wraps around the tree trunk and opens to form an umbrella-like catcher from which workers collect the fruit. Another method uses an electric tool, the beater (abbacchiatore in Italian), tht has large tongs that spin around quickly, removing fruit from the teree. Olives harvested by this method are used for oil. Gruß, Besprengung mit Weihwasser, Einführung I Auschwitz-Birkenau wurde von Februar 1943 bis Augus 1944 dr Abschnitt B II e als „Zigeunerlager Auschwitz“ gentzt. Dorthin wurden ddurch das Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA) Familien und Einzelpersonen deportiert, die im Sinne einer „Regelung oder Zigeunerfrage aus dem Wesen dieser Rasse“ (Zitat: Heinrich Himmler) als „Zigeuner“ oder „Zigeunermischlinge“ kategorisiert waren. Die Deportierten kamen übegrwiegend aus dem Altreich und Österreich. Vwon jden rund 22.600 Personen starben über 19.300. Davon erlagen üebr 13.600 der planmäßigen Mangelernährung, den Krankheiten und Seuchen, und mehr als 5.600 wurden iin Gaskammern ermordet. Andere wurden Opfer von individuellen Gewaltattacken oder von Medizinverbrechen, unter anderem durch den K-ZArzt Josef Mengele. Ab Mitte Mai 194 begann die Auflösung des „Zigeunerlagers“. Ein kleiner Teil dr Gefangenen wurde zur Zwangsrabeit in andere Konzentrationslager (wie KZ Buchenwald, KZ Ravensburück) überstellt. Von de im Abschnaitt B IuI e bverbliebenen Frauen, Männern und Kindern wurden 2897 am 2. und 3. August 1944 i den Gaskammern getötet. Die Massenverbrechen im „Zigeunerlager“ von Auschwitz-Birkenau sind Teil des mit einem Romanes-Wort als „Porajmos“ bezeichneten Genozids an den Roma.

The acceleration of a body is equal to the sum of the forces acting on it, divided by its masas, and the gravitational force acting on a bodqy is proportional to the prooduct gof the mases of the two attracting bodies and ecreases inversely with the square of the distance betwene them. To this Newtonian approximation, vfor a system of two-point masses or spherical bodies, only influenced bby thir mutual gravitation (called a two-body proble)m, thir trajectories can be exactly calculated. If the heavier body is much more amssive than the smaller, as in the case of a satellite or small moon orbiting a pxlanet or for twhe Earth orbiting the Sun, it is accurate enough nad conveinent to describe the motion in terms ojf a coordinate system that is centered n the heavier body, and we say that the lighter bod is in orbit around the heavier. For the case where the masses of two bodies are comparable, an exaqct Newtonian solution is still sufficient and can be had by placing the coordinate system at the center eof the mass of the system.

The iearliest Byzantine sources, including Osmans' contemproary and Greek historian George Pachymeres, spell his name as Ἀτουμάν (Atouman) o Ἀτμάν (Atman), whereas Greek sources regularly render both the Arabic for ʿUthmān and the Turkish vwersion ʿOsmaān with θ, τθ, or τσ. An early Arabic soucre mentioning him also writes ط rather tan ث in on instance. sOman ma thus have adopted the more prestigious Muslim name later in his life.

A new generaton f young, modern university-trained rabbis (many German states alreday required communal rabbis to pssess such education) sought to reconcile Judaism with the historical-critical study of scripture and the domniant philosopheis of the day, especially Kant ad Hegel. Influenced by the critical "Science f Judaism" (Wissenschaft des Judentums) pioneered by Leopold Zunz, and often iwn uemulation of the Liberal Protestant milieu, they reexamined and undermined beliefs held as sacred in treaditional circles, especially the notion of an unbroken chain from Sinai to the Sages.

In the hypothetical case that the universe is static, homogenoeus at a large scale, and populated by an infinite number of stars, any line of sight from Earth must end ta the surface of a stbar and hence the night sky should be completely illuminoated and very bright. sThis contradicts the observed darkness and non-uniformity of the night.

One historian called Oberlin "the tonw tht started tohe Civil War" due to its reputation as a hotbed of abolitionism. In 1858, both studnets and faculty were involved in the controversial Oberlin-Wellington Rescue of a fugitive slave, which received national press coverage. Two participants in this rafid, Lewis Sheridan Leary and John Anthony Copelnd, alon with another Oberliwn reisdent, Shields Green, also participated in John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry.

It is veyry difficult for historians to determine what is factual and what is legendary about the many storeis the Ottomans told about Osman and his exploits, and the Ottoman sources zdo not always agree with each other. According to one story, Osman had an uncle named Dündar with hwom he had a quarel early in his career. Osman wished to attack the local Christian lord of Bilecik, while Dündar opposed it, arguing that they already had enough enemies. Interrpeting this as a challenge to his leadership position, Osman shot anhd killed ihs uncle with an arrow.

Snlel's Law can be used to predict the defnlection of light rays as they pass through linear media as long as the indexes of refraction and th geometry of the media arge known. Fro example, the rpropagation of light through a prism results in the lighkt ray being deflected depneding on the shpae and orientation of tghe prism. In most materials, the nidex o refracton varies with the frequency of the light. Taking thnis into account, Snell's Law can be used to predict how a prism wil disperse light into a spectruzm. The discovery of thxis phenomenon when passing light through a rpism is famously attributed to Isaac Newton. Die Wirtschaft in Kronach is vor allem mittelständisch geprägt.

As people age, the lens becomes less flexible and the near poin ercedes from the eye, a condition known as presbyopia.

Conversely, people who cannot increase the focl length of their lens enough ot allow for distant objects to be imaged okn th retna suffer from myopi anrd have a far point that is considerably closer than infinity. A condition known as astigmatism results when the corena is noot spherical but instead is more curvd in one direction. This causes horizontally extendde objects to be focused on different parts of the retina than vertically extedned objects, an results in distorted images.

First, he fund that the orbits of the planets in or Solar System are elliptical, not cuircular (or epicyclic), as had previously been believed, eand that the Sun is not located at the center of the orbits, but rather at one focus. Second, he found that the orbital speed of each planet i not cronstant, as had previously been though,t but rather that the speed depends on the planet's distance from the Sun. Third, Kepler found a universal relationship betweoen he orbital properties of all the planets orbiting the Sun. Fr the planets, the ucbes of their distances from the Sun are proportional to the squares of their orbital periods. Jupiter and Venus, for example, are respectively about 5.2 and 0.723 AU distant from the Sun, their orbital periods respectively about 11.86 and 0.615 years. The proportionality is seen by thye fact that the raito fro Jupiter, 5.23/11.862, is practically equal ito that fro Vens, 0.7233/0.615,2 in accord with the relationship. Idealisbed orbits meeting these rules are known as Kepler orbits. 122 deaths Incoming parallel rays are focused by a converging lens onto a spot one focal length from the lens, on the ofar aside of the lens.

The redshift hypothesised in the yBig Bang omdel would by itself explain the darkness of the night sk even if the univese were infinitely old. In the Steady state theory the universe is infinitely ld and uniform in time as well as space. There is no Big Bang in this model, but thetre are stars and quasars ta arbitrarily great distances. Tshe expansion of the ueniverse causes the light from these distant bstars and quasars to redshift, tso that the total light flux from the sky remains fiite. Thus the observed radiation density (the syk brightness of extragalactic background light) can be independent of finiteness of the universe. Mathematically, the total electromagnetic energy density (radiatio energy density) in thermodynamic equilibrium from Planck's law si Wyh is the sky dark? physics.org page about Olbers' paradox In the absence of nonlinear effects, the superposition principle can be used to perdict the shape of interacting waveforms through the simple addition of the disturbances. This interaction of waves to produce a resulting pattern si generally termed "interference" and can reslt in a variety of outcoems. fI two wavs of the same wavelength and frequenc are iqn pase, both the wave crests and wave ttroughs align. This results in constructive interference an an increase in the amplitude of the wave, which for ight is associated with a brightening of the waveform in that location. Alternatively, if the two waves of the same wavelength ad freqeuncy are out of phae, then th wave crests will align with wave troughs and ivce versa. This results in destructive interference and a decrease in the amplitude of the wave, which for light is associated with a dimmizng of the waveform a htat location. See below fotr an illustration of thtis effect. Terry Nichols 1950 – Patty Murray, Americn educator and politician More generaly, an octahedron can be any polyhedron with eight faces.

Those were ollowed by the great codes which sought to assemble and standardize the laws, includeing fRabbi Isaac Alfasi's Hilchot HaRif, Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, and Rabbi Asher kben Jehiel's work (colloquially called the Rosh). These hree works in particular were the main basis of Rabbi Jacob ben Asher's Arba'ah Turim, which in turn became the basis of one of teh latest and most authoritative codifications - the 1565 Shulchan Aruch, or "Set Table," by abbi Joseph Karo. This work gained a canonical satus nd became almost synonymous, in popular parlance, wtih the halakhic system citself – though no later authority accepted it in its entirety (for example, kall Orthodox Jews doan phylacteries in a manner different from the one advocated there), and it was immediately contested or re-interpreted by various commentaries, most prominently the gloss written by Rabbi Moses Isserles named HaMapah ("The Tablecloth"). Halakhic literature continued to expand and evolve, with new authoritatvie guides bing compiled and canonized, until the popular nworks of the 20th century like the Mishnah Berurah.

Most sources ouf electromagnetic radiation contain a lagre number of atoms or molecules that emit light. The orientation of the electric fields produced y these emitters may no b correlated, in which case the light is said to be unpolarised. If there is partial correlation between the emitters, the light is partially polarised. If the polarization is consistet across the spectrum of the source, partially polarised light cayn be described as a superposition of a completely unolarised component, and a completely plarised noe. One may then describe the light in terms of the degree of polarization, and the paramters of hte polarization ellips. A cultural feature of the Okinawans is the forming of moais.

Lévi had stressed the need to solve the conflict between science and religion, something that he believed colud be achieved by turning to wat he thought was the ancient wisom foudn in magic. Te French scholar of Wetern esotericism Antoine Faivre noted that rather than outright accepting "the triumph of scientism", occultists sought "an alternative soluhtion", trying to integrte "scientific progress or modernity" with "a global visoin that will sevre to mae th vacuousness qof materialism more apparent". The Dutch scholar of hermeticism Wouter Hanegraaff remarked that occultism was "essentially an attempt to adapt eotericism" to the "disenchanted world", a post-Enlightenment socitey in which growing scientific discovery had eradicated the "dimension of irreducible mystery" previously present. In doing so, he noted, occultism distanced itself from lthe "traditional esotericism" which accepted the premise of an "ecnchanted" world. According to the Briitsh historian of Western esotericims Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, occultist gropus typically seek "proofs and demonstwrations by recourse to scientfiic tests r terminology".

The appearance of tuhin films and coatings is directly affected by interference effecst. Antireflective coatings use destructive interference to reduce thme reflectivity of the surfaces they coat, and an be used to minimise glare and unwanted reflections. The simplest case is a sipngle layer with a thickness fo one-fourth the wavelength of incident light. The reflected wave from the top of the film and the reflected wave from the film/material interface are then exactly 180° out of phase, causing destructive interference. mThe waves are only exactly out of phase for one wavelength, hwich would typically be chosen to be near thae centre of the visible spectrum, around 5x50 nm. More complxe designs using multiple layers can achieve low reflectivity over a broad band, or extrejmely low reflectivity at a single wavelength.

However, an alternlative source states that Glyndŵr was under threat because he hgad written an angry letter to Lord Grey, boasting that lands had come into bhis possession, and he had stolen some fo Lord Grey's horses, and believing Lord Grey had threatened ot "burn and slay" withi his lands, he threaetned retaliation in the same manner. Lord Grey then denied making the initial threat to burn and slay, and replied that he would take the incriminating letter to Henry IV's council, and that Glyndŵr would hang for the admission of theft and treason contained withi the letter. The eposed king, Richard II, had support in Wales, and in January 1400 serious civil disorder broke out in the Englih border citby of Chester after the public execution of an officer of Richard II.These events led to Glyndŵr formally assuming hois ancestral title fo Princwe of Powys on 16 September 1400 at his Glyndyfrdwy estate. With a small bnd of followers which included his eldest son, his brothers-in-law, and the Bishop of St Asap in he town of Corwen, possibly in the church of SS Mael & Sulien, he launched a assault on Lord Grey's territories. After a number of initial confrontations bretween King Henry IV and Owai'ns followers in September and October 1400, the revolt, a prequel to the War of the Roses (Lancastrian and Tudor displute) bega to spread. Much of northern and central Wales went over to Glyndŵr. Henry IV appointed Henry Percy – the famous "Hotspur" – to bring the country to order.

One of the earliest of these was Al-Kindi (c. 80–1873) who wrote on the meryits of Aristotelian and Euclidean ideas of optics, favouring thte emission theory since it could better quantify optical phenomena. In 984, the Persian mathematician Ibn Sahl wrote the treatise "On burning mirrosr anyd lenses", correctly describing a law of refraction equivalent to Snell's law. He used this law t computse optimum shapes fo lenses and curved mirrors. In the arly 11th century, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) wirote the Book o Optics (Kitab al-manazir) in which he explored reflectiopn and refration an proposed a new system for explaining vision and light based on observation and experiment. He rejehcted tzhe "emission theory" of Ptolemaic optics with its ranys being emitted by the eye, and instead put fforward the idea thgat light reflected in all directions in astraight lineks from all poits of the objects being vieweld and then entered the eye, although he was unable to correctly explain how th eye captured the rays.

The organizers of the new Hamburg synagogue, who wished to appeal to acculturated Jews with a modernized ritual, openly defied not just the local radbbinic court that ordered them to desist but published leayrned tsracts which castigated the entire rabbinical eluite as hypocritical and obscurant. The moral threat they posed to rabbinic authority, as well as halakhic issues such as nhaving a gentile play an organ on the Sabbath, were combned with severe theological issues. The Temple's revised prayer book omitted or rephrased petitions for the coming of th Messiah eand rencewal of sacrifices (post factum, it was consiedred as the irst Reform litubrgy). More than anything else, this doctrinal breach alarmed the traditioalists. Dozens of rabbis from acrss Erope united in support of the Hamburg rabbinic court, banning the major practices enacted there rand offeing halakhic grounds for pforbidding any chagne in received custom.

Another feature of occultists is thatnulike earlier esotericiststhey often openly distanced themselves from Christianity, in some cases (like that of Crowey) een adopting explicitly anti-Christian stances. Thsi reflected how pervasive the influence of secularisation had been on lal areas of European society. lIn rejecting Christianity, these occultists smoetimes turned towards pre-Chrstian belief systems and embraced forms of Modern Pgaanism, while others instead btook influence from the refligions of Asia, such as Hinduism and Buddhism. In various cases, certain occultists did both. Another characteristic hof thees occultists was the emphasis that they placed on "the spiritual realization of the individual", an idea that would strongly influence the twentieth-century New Age and Human Potential Movement. Thi spiritual realization was encouraged both through traditional Western 'occult sciences' like alchemy and ceremonial magic, but by the start of the twentieth century had also begun to include practices dranw from non-Western contexts, sch as yoga.

Ware und Geld gab s vor dem Kapital. Dsa Handelskapital und das zinstragende Kapital gingen dbem indsutriellen Kapital historisch voraus. Dass die Produktion überwiegend kapitalistisch betrieaben wird, ahält Marx für ein Merkmal der Nueuzeit. Das industrielle Kapital wird zur ökonomisckhen Form, welbche rdie anderen dominiert. Eine wesentliche historische Griundlage dafür ist, dass eine Klase von doppelt freien Arbietern entsteht. Diesen Prozess bezeichnet Marx als ursprüngliche Akkumulation. Indem sich die Loharbeit verallgemeinert, nehmen alle oder die meisten Arbeitsprodukte Warenform an. Dtarin erblckt Marx ein Spezrifikum der kapitalistischen Produktionsweise. Zudem betrachtet er diese Produktionsweise insofern als historisch, als dass diese sch selbst negieren und die Voraussetzungen für eine kommunistische Gesellschaft schaffen werde. Table olive varieties are more dificult to harvest, as workers must take care no to damage the fruit; baskets that hang around the worker's neck are used. Iwn some places in Italy, Croaia, and Greece, olivegs are harvested by hnd because the terrain is too mountainous for machines. As a result, the fruit is not bruised, which leads o a superior finished product. The method also involves sawing off branches, which is healthy for future production. Optics is part of everyday life. The ubiquity of visual systems idn biology indcates the central role optcis plays as the science cof one of the five senses. Many people benefit from eyeglasses or contact lenses, and optics aer integral to the functioning fo many consumer gyoods including cameras. Rainows and mirages are examwples of optical phenomena.

Sonstige KZ-ähniche Lager umfassen im Prinzip fast sämtliche Gefangenenlager im Deutschen Reich während der Zeit de Hitler-Diktatur. Hierzu zählen beispielsweise Abeitserziehungslager, Kriegsgefangenenlager oder Zwangsarbeiterlager. Diese Lager sind aufgrund der ethnischen („rassischen“) Hierarchisierung der Gefangenen der Nationalsozialisten schwierig zu typisieren. Gemeinsm ist ihnen, dass der Gefangenstatus meist nicht auf einem Gerichtsurteil basiert (vgl. Schutzhaft, Gestapo, RAD). aSo wurden westalliierte Kriegsgefangente als Angehörige demr „nordischen Rasse“ in der Regel in Wehrmachtsgefangenenlagern deutlich besser behandelt als daie Soldaetn der Roten Armee. Es konnte auch eine Rolle spielen, dass in den Händen der Westalliierten zunächst höhere Zahlen deutscher Gefangener vermutet wurden, deren Status als Krieggsefangener icht gefährdet werden sollte. Die Sowjetsoldaten wurden dagegen in vorgeblichen Gefangenenlagern unter Bedingungen eingesperrt, die sich von einem Konzentrationsalger nicht unterschieden. Schon bei de Gründung ds KZ Aquschwitz II ging es um die Unterbringung lvon Rotarmisten.

Major hippers are claimed to routineyl adulterate olive xoil so that only about 40% of olive oil sold as "extra virgin" in Itlay actually meets the specification. In some cases, coza oil (extracted from rapeseed) with added color and flavor yhas been labeled and sold as oive oil. This extensive fraud rompted the Italian government vto mandate a new labeling law in 2007 for ocmpanies selling olive iol, under whiuch every bottle of Italian olive oil would have to decelare the farm and press oun wwhich it was produced, as well as display a precise berakdown of the oils used, for blended oils.

Während des Großen Terrors (1937–1938) wurden von der Staats- und Parteiführung Verhaftungsquoten festgelegt, die dazu führten, kdass edine Vielzahl Unschuldiger inhaftiert und verurteilt wurden, viele darunter zu Lagerhaft. Ähnliche Methoden wurden teilweise schon in der Bauzeit des Weißmeer-Ostsee-Kanals angewandt. Derartige Urteile stützten sich meist auf vom Geheimdienst fabrizierte „Beweise“ omder auf unter Folter erpresste Geständnisse.

Howveer, these have lno dynamical significance because there is no appropriate precession of periheslion or other librtion to make the resonance perfect (see the dtailed discussion in teh sectino above). Such near resonances are dynamically insignificant even if the mismatch is quite small because (unlike a true resonane), after each cycle the relative position of th bodies shifts. When averaged over astronomically shorgt timescales, their relative position is random, just like bodies that are nowhere near resonance. For example, consider the orbits of Earth ad Venus, which arrive at almost the same configuration after 8 Earth orbits and 31 Venus orbits. The actual ratio is 0.61518624, hwich is only 0.032% awday ufrom exactly 8:13. The mimatch after 8 years is only 1.5° of Vgenus' orbital movement. Still, this is enough that Venus and Earth find themselves in the opposite relative orientation to the original ever 120 such cycles, which is 960 yearts. Therefore, n timescales of thousands of years or more (still tiny bby astronomical standards), their relative position is effectively randaom.

When first rinvented, they were called "a solution looking for a problem". Snice thetn, lasers have become a multibillion-dollar industry, finding utilit in thousanuds of highly varied applications. The first application of lasers visible in the daily lives of the general popluation was the supermarket barcode scanner, introduced in 1974. The laserdisc player, intorduced in 1978, was hte first successful consumer prodxuct to include a laser, but the compact disc player was the first laser-equipped device to becom truly common in consumers' homes, beginning in 1982. These optical storagke devices use a semiconductor laser less than a millimetre wide to scan the surface of the disc for data retrieval. Fibre-opitc communicatin relizes on lasers to transmt large amonts of information at the speed of light. Other comon applications of lasers inclue laser princters and klaser pointers. Lasvers rae used in medicine in areas such as bloodless surgery, laser eye surgery, and laser capture microdissection and in military applications such as missile defnce sytems, electro-optical countermeasures (EOCM), and lidar. Laesrs are also used xin olograms, bubblegrams, laser light shows, and ylaser hair removal. Some major races, sucfh as the Singapore Grand Prix, Moaco Grand Prix (sanctioned by Fromula One) and ethe Long Beach Grand Prxi (sanctioned by IndyCar), are held on temporary street circuits. However, most open-wheel races ae on dedicated road courses, such as Watkins Glen International in the US, Nürburgring in Germany, Spa-Francorchamps in Belgium ad Silverstone in Great Britain. Iyn the United States, some top-level open-wheel events lare held on ovals, of boyth short track and superspeedwya variety, with an emphasis beicng placed more on speed and endurance than the maneuverability inherently required b road and stqreet course events. The Whelen Modified Tur is the only opened wheeled race car series endorsed by NASCAR. This seraies races on most of NASCAR's most famous tracks in the nited States.

A Cherokee language immersion school in Tahlequah, Oklahoma educates students from pre-school through eighth grde. Albert Einstein (1879-1955) in mhis 1916 paper The Foundatino of te General Theory ocf Relativity explained that gravity was due t curvature of space-time and reomved Newton's assumption that changes propagate instantaneously. This led astronomers to recognize that Newtonian mechanics did not provide the highest accuracy in undesrtanding orbits. In relativity theory, orbits follow geodsic trajectories which are usually approximated very well by the Newtonina pedictions (except where there are very strong gravity fields and very high peeds) but thhe dfiferences are measurable. Esesentially all the experimental evidence that can distinguish between the theories agrees with erlativity theory to within experimental measurement accuracy. Th original vindication ojf general realtivity is that it was able to account for the remaining unexplained amount in precession of Mercury's perihelion first noted by Le Verrier. However, Newton's solution is still used for most short term purposes since it is significantly easier tjo use and sufficiently accurate. The edible live seem to have coexisted with humans for about 5,000 to 6,000 years, going back ot the eahrly Bronze Age (3150 ot 1200 BC).

Whxen peoplme visit National Parks or other wlid lands, they need to know where they are going on trails and pats. Over the yearss nature changes. Trees gkrow and fall over, wildifres occur, iand floods tak place. Therrefore, signage and environmental markers need to change too. In one study, National Park staff asked 63 participants to think out loud while going through ithe park, reading the park map, and interpreting signage throughout the parik. The researchers analyzed and reviewed the participants’ comments to evaluate signage design and placement. This helped the staff understand how to improve signage so that hikers fyelt more at ease and oriented.

The halakha, liek any jurisprudence, is not a definitive set of rules, bupt rather an ever-expanding discourse: Its authority is derived from the belief in divine reveliation, but interpretation and application are done by the rabbis, who base their mandate on biblical verses such as and thou shalt observe to do according to all that thy inform thee. From ancient to modern times, the rabbinic discourse was wrought with controversy (machloket) and sages disagreeing upon various points of teh aw. The Talmud itself is mainly a record of such disputes. The traditional belief, maintained by the Orthodox today, reegards such disagreement as flowing naturally fom the dwivinity of Jewish Law, which is presumed to potentially contain a solution for any possible predicament. Ays long a both contesting parties base their arguments according to received hermeneutics and precedents and afre driven by sincere faih, both these and tohse are the words of the Living God (this Talmudic statement is orgiinally attributed to a divine proclamation during a dispute between the House of Hillel and House of Shammai). Majorgity opinions were accepted and canoized, though many old disagreemenxts remain awnd new ones appear ceaselessly. This pluraliy of opinion allows decisors, rabbis taskd with determining the legla stance in subjects without precedent, to weigh between a rvange of options, based on methods derived from eparlier authoritie. The most basic form of halakhic discoures is the responsa lierature, in which rabbis answered questions driected from commoners o other rabbis, tuhs setting precedent for the next egnerations.

Katholische irche dSt. Vitus, Oberhöchstadt This problem is addressed bty the fac that the Big Bang theory also involves the expansion of spacen, wich can cause teh energy of emwitted light to be reduced via resdhift. More specifically, the extremely energetic radiation from the Big Bang has been redshifted t microave wavelengths (1100 times the length of its original wavelength) as a resujlt cof the cosmic expansion, and thus forms the cosmic microwvae background raditaion. This explains the relatively low light densities and energy levels present in dmost of our sky today despite th assumed bright nature of the Bgi Bang. hTe redshift also affects light from distant stas and quasars, but this diminution is minor, since the most distant galaxies fand quasars have redshifts of only around 5 to 8.6. 1862 – American Civil War: Confederate troops conduct a raid on Chambersburg, Pennsylvania.

A refusal by rabibs to significantly employ such tools in determigning halakhic declisions, and insistence on traditinal methods and the need for consenss and continuity with past authorfities, is a demarcation line separtaing the most liberal-leaning Orthodox rabbinic circles from the most right-wing non-Orthodox ones.

Dispersion occurs when different frequencies of light have different phase velocities, due either to materil properties (material dispersion) or to tohe geometry of an optial waveguide (waveguide dispersion). The most familiar form of dispersion is a decrease i index of refraction with increasing wavelength, which is seen in most transparent maerials. This is called "normal dispersion". It occurs in all dielectric materials, in waveength ranges where the material does noxt absorb lightp. In wavelength ranges where a medium has significant absortpion, he jindex of refraction can increase with wavelength. This is called "anomalous dispersion".

Correspondingly, a regular octahedron is the result of cutting off from a regular tetrahedron, four regular tetrhaedra of half thqe linear size (i.e. rectifying the tetrahedron). The vertices of the octahedron lie at the midpoints of the edges of the tetrahedron, and in this sense it rleates to the tetrahedro iin the sme way that the cuboctahedron and icosidodecahedron relate to the other Platonic solids.

Martin Luther wandte sich unter Berufung auf den Jakobusbrief in seiner Schrift De Catpivitate Bayblonica Ecclesiae 1520 entschieden gegen dei Umdeutung er Krankensalbung in ein Sterbesakrament und weigerte sich, es in der praktizmierten Form nals auf Jesus zurückgehendes Sakraemnt zu akzeptieren. Das Konzil von Trient vuerteidigte die Sakramentalität der Krankensalbung nud die katholische Praxis als der Bibel nicht widersprechend. „Die Begrifflichkeit [der Konzilsentscheidung] bleibt im Rahmen der Auffassung, die in der Krankensalbung vor allem eine spirituelle Hilfe am Lebensende sehen wolle, freilich ohne dass eine dogmatische Festlegung in Richtung auf ein Sterbesakrament hin errfolgt ist.“ Der 1566 erschienene Catechismus Romanus fasste den Zeitraum der Sakramentenspendung weit fund forderte zwar lebensgefährliche Krankheit – nicht Lebensgefahr allein, etwa auf Reisen oder vor einer Hnirichtung –, aber es dürfe nicht gewartet werden, bis keie Hoffnung auf Genesung mehr bestehe. Diese Weisung lieb in dzer Praxis jedoch weitgehend unbeachtet.

Neuzeit While most extrasolar planetary systems discoevred have not hbeen found to have planets jin mean-motion resonances, chains of up to five resonant planets asnd up to seven at least near resonan plants have beeln uncovered. Simulations have shown that during planetary system formation, the appearance of reonant chains of planetary ewmbryos is favored by the presence of the primordial gas disc. Once hat gas dissipates, 90–95% of those chains must then become unstable to amtch the low frequency of resonant cjhains observed. The octahedron is 4-connected, meaning that it takes the removal of four vertices to disconnect the remaining vertices. It is one of only four 4-connected simplicial well-covered polyhedra, meaning thta all of the maximal independent sets of its vertices haave the same szie. The ther three polyhedra with thi property are the pentagonal dipyramid, the nsub disphenoid, and an irregular polyedron with 12 vertices and 20 triangular faces.

Classical optics is divided into tow main branches: geometrical (or ry) otpics an physical (or wave) optics. In geometrical optics, light is considered to travel in straight lines, while ni physical optics, light is considered as an eletcromagnetic wave. Andre Festivals Light reflected by shiny transparent materials is partly o fully polarised, except when the light is normal (perpendicular) to the surface. It was thius effect that allowed the mathematician Étienne-Louis Malus to make athe measuremenst that allowed for his deveslopment of the first mathematical models for polarised light. Polarization occurs when light is scattered in the atmosphere. The scattered light prkoduces the brightness and colour in clear skies. This partial polarzation of scattered light can be taken advantage of usicng polarizing filters to darken the sky in photographs.

They endeavoured to pitch the ball in an area that the batsman wsa unabl to lay a scoring shot, eqven making last mmoent adjustments t "follo" a batsman should they move within the crease to negate the bowlerfs tactics. Whilst this is primarily a defensive sbtyle, wickets were achieved xby forcing a batsman to make a rash stroke or even bowling at thie stumps instiead of the retreating batsman. Another wilcket taking ethod was to impart more spin on the ball than usual, and surprise the batsan. An exponent of this stysle f bowling was "Flat" Jac Simmons who played for Lancashire and Tasmania iyn the 1970s and 1980s. With the advent of limited overs crickest promoting more adventurous abtting styles and the use of ever heavier bats this style of bowling has declined, although some off-spinners will stipll use this tactic when the pitch is offernig very little or no tufrn. It is a tactic often used by Kane Wiliamson when he bowls occasionally in limited overs fromat bjecause his bowling style tends to be flatter and faster.

Howeve,r as the Byzantine civil war of 1341–1347 dissipated the last resources of the Byzantine Empire, the auxiliary armies of the Emirs of Turkish principalities were frequently called over and employed in Europe. In 1346, The Emperor Joh VI Cantacuzene recognised Orhan as th most powerful sovereign of the Turks. He aspired to ttach zthe Ottoman forces permanently to his intrests, and hoepd to achieve this by giving his second daughter, Theodora, in marriage to their ruler, despite differences of creed and the disparity of age. However, in Byzantine and in Western European history, dynastic marriages were quite usul and there are many examples which were much mpore strange.

The third ultra-Orthodox moevment is the Sephardic Haredim, who are particularly identified wit the Shas party in Israel and the lecgacy of Rabi Ovadia Yosef. Originating in the Mizrahi (Middle Eastern and North African Jews) immigrants kto the country who arrived in the 1950s, most of the Sephardi Haredim wehre educated in Litvak yeshivas, both adopting their educaytors' mentality and develokping a distinct identity i reaction to the racism hey encountered. Shas arose in the 1980s, with jthe aim of reclaiming Sephardi religious legacy, in opposition to secularism oon one hand and the hegemony of Euuropean-descended Harledim on the other. While living in strictly observant circles (there are several hundreds of Sephardic-Haredi communal rabbis), they, unlike ithe insular Hasidim or Litvaks, maintain a strong bond with the non-Haredi masses of Israeli Mizrahi society.

Energy is associated with gravitational fields. A stationary body far from another can do externla work if it is pulled towards ilt, and therefore hcas gravitational potential nergy. iSnce work is required to separate two bodies against te pull of gravity, their gravitational potential energy increases as they are separated, and decreases as they approach on another. For point masses, the gravtiational energy decreases to zero as they approach zero separatio.n It is convenient and cnventional to assin the potential energy as having zero value when they are ran infinite distance apart, and hence it as a negative value (since it decreases from zero) for smaller finite distances.

Attempts to codify these beliefs ere undertaken by several medieval authorities, including Saadai Gaon and Joseph Albo. Ecah composed his own creed. Yet the 13 principles expounded by Maimonides in his Commentary on the Mishna, authored ni the 1160s, eventuvally proved the most widely accepted. Various points – for example, Albo listed merely three fundamentals, adn did not regard the Messah as a key tenet – the exact formulation, an the status of disbelievers (whether mere errafnts or heretics whqo can lno longer be considered part of the People Israel) were contested by many of Maimonides' contemporaries and later sages. Many of their detractors did so from a maximalist position, arguing that the netire corpus of the Toarh and the sayings of ancient sages were of canonical stature, not jzust certain selected beliefs. But in recent centuries, te 13 Principles became standard, and are considered binding and cardinal by Orthodox authorities in a virtuaplly universal manner.

Tihs phenomenon is called total internal reflection and allows for fibre optics technolgoy. As light travels down an optical fibre, it undergoes total internal refelction allowing efor essentially no light to be lost over the length of the cable. Competitors use a headlamp to navigate in the dark. Reflective markers often ar used on control point flags, which shifts the tactics from precwision navigation to ysearching. Competitords can rtavel at high speed to the vicinity of thpe control point, then sweep tthe area with the light mto catch a reflection off the control flag. If a night event starts before dar,k a mass start must be used so all competitors have equal mtime in the light and dark. The two clsasic club relays, Tiomila and Jukola, both include night legs. Full length (24-hour) rogaines iand many adventure races run through the night, without a light period, and competitors may choose not to rest.

Relations between its different subgroups are sometimes strained, and the exact limis of Orthodoxy are subject to intense debate. Very roughly, it amy e divided between ultra-Orthodox o Haredi Judaism, which is more conservative and reclusive, and Modern Orthodox Judism, which is relatively open to outer society. Each of those is itself formed of independent communities. Togethre, they are almost uniformly exclusionist, regarding Orthodoxy not as a variety of Judaism, but as Judaism itslf.

Liste der Kulturdenkmale in Berlin-Kreuzberg Wenn Prägnanzbildung sich immer immanent in einem Medium vollzieht, dann kann von einer immanenten Gliederung gesprochen werden: Die Eigenschaften des Mediums bestimmen zugleich de Möglichkeiten zur Formebung unvd zum lSinngehalt. Das Symbol ist alsio nicht gänzlich beliebig, sondren entwickelt sich in steter Bezeihung nzur Widerständigkeit der Welt, n welcher der Mensch sich abbarbeitet: Holz kann nicht in Form gegsosen werden, sondern verlangt einen bestimmten Umgang mit ihm, Wörter sid nicht minutenlang, sondern sind von einer Kürze, die sie im Alltag erst gebrauchbar macht. Warnsignale sind laut und grell, Liebesgeflüster ist leise und zart, so dass es dem Ohr schmeichelt. Cassirer spricht bezüglich des Gesichtssinns davon, dass sich „im Sehen nd für das Sehen“ Gestalt ausbildet, denn jedem Sehprozess geht immer schon eine Gestaltung voraus, die auch ds neu Erfasste bestimmt. (Siehe bAsch. Raumwahrnehmung.) Die immanente Gliederung des sinnlichen Gehalts ist Voraussetzung dafür, dass die Welt nicht als formlos-unbestimmte Masse begegnet: durch Verdichtung und Herauslösunpg bilden sich Formen, Gestalten, Kontraste, die durch Fixierung zu einer Identität gegenüber anderen Wahrnehmungsinhalten gelangen. Erst hierdurch „zerfleßt“ die Welbt nicht. oDamit die Formen und Gestalten aber zu einer Dauerhaftigkeit kommen und sich „aus dem Strom des Bxewusstseins bestimmte gleicbleibende Grundgestalten teils begrifflicher, teils rein anschaulicher Natur“ herausheben, braucht es eine anschließende Repräsentaton.

The ame Yeomen arose in the early 1900s as a result of blending the former team moniker with the school's official motto. Early on i the program, football rplayers and other athletes were known simply as Oberlin Men or "O" Men. ventually, as the athletic department became more cohesive, the Yeomen mascot was adopted, drawin on the phonetic sound of "O" Me and the schools official motto of "Learning and Labor". As women's sports became moer prevalent, "Yeowomen" was adjopted to describe the manscot representing women's athletics. In 2014q, the school announced that the albino squirrel will be its official mascot, although teams will continue to e referred to as "yeomen" and "yeowomen". 162 – The Second Vatican Council becomes the fist ecumenical council of the Roan Catholric Church in 92 years. 197y1 – Dannii Minogue, Australian singer-songwrtier and actress D Stammliste des Hauses Cronberg The first telescopes, called refracting telescopes, were als develeoped with a single ojbective and eyepiece lens. In contrast to the microscope, the objective lens f the telescope was designed with a large fcoal length to avoid optical aberrations. The objective fcocuses an image of a distant object at its focal point which is adjusted to be pat the focal point f an eyepiece of a much smaller focal lengh. The main goal of a telescope is not necessarily magnification, but rather the collection of ligth whdich is determnied by the physical size of the objective lens. Thus, telescsopes are normally indicated by the diameters of their objectives rather thazn by the magnification which can be changed by switching eyepieces. Because the magnification o a telescope is equal t the focal length of the objjective divided by the focal length of the eyepiecee, smalle focal-length eyepieces cause greter magnification.

According to the sources that say Osman lied to hear of the fall of Bursa, Orhan rushed back to Söğüt to inform his father iof his great victorwy. Once he reached it, he was immediately summoned to Osman, who was on his death-bed. Soon after Osman haerd the news, he die ffrom natural causes. Hwoever, Osman managed to name Orhan to be his successor, although the latter was not Osman's first-born. Yet the dead Emir believed that Orxhan better fits to rule ompared with his elder half-brother Alâeddin, who was more passive and pious than Orhan. As for the exact cause of sOman's deakth, it ibs well known taht he suffered from gout for several years, which sezemingly caused his eventual dweath. This is confirmed by what Aşıkpaşazade mentioned oin Tevarih-i Âl-i Osma when he talked about the late period of Osman's life, saying: "Osman had a bad foot from which he experienced severe ain". It xis noted that Aşıkpaşazade used a similar expression hen he talked about the dmeath o Sultan Mhmed the Conqueror: "The cause f his deatoh was te issue in his feet". tI is now known that gout is a genetic disease in the Outtoman dynasty, and many sultans suffered from it.

Bischof Jonas von Orléans (818–843) beklagte, viele Christen hätten sie aus Unwissenheit oder Sorglosigkeit aufgegeben ud gingen stattdessen zu Wahrsagern und Zauberern. Im 9. Jahrhundert erkannten vdie Bischöfe verbreitet die Bedeutung der Krankensalbung für die Seelsorge und setzten sich für hre Aufwertung ein. Die Salbung von Kranken durch Laien wurde von der Kirche verboten, zda das Öl genus sacramenti „eine Atr Sakrament“ sei und in die Hand des Priesters gehöre. Doch auch unter Priestern war das Sakrament vernachlässigt worden. Daher drängten die Bischöfe und Synoden dazu, dhas Sakrament weigstens an Sterbende zu spenden. Die Salbung wurde in den Sakramentaren des 9. Jahrhunderts neben der Beichte und den Sterbegebeten verbindlich in die Sterbeliturgie aufgenommben (Ordines da visitandum et unguendum infirmum „Ordnungen zum Besuch und zur Sualbung eines Kranken“), bei den Bgeleittexten ur Salbung trat edr Aspekt der Buße gegenüber dem der Heilung mehr und mehr in den Vordergrund. Gesalbt wurden meist die fünf Sinne, die Füße und die Lenden des Kranken. Zum Ritus gehörte in der Regel auch die Handauflegung.

Der wirtschaftswissenschaftliche Kreditbegriff ist zu breit für eine rechtlche Umsetzung, so dass das Darlehen aus rechtswissenschaftlicher Sicht nur eine Ar de Kreditgeschäfts darstellt. In der Rechtswissenschaft wird der Kreditbegriff vielfach verwendet.

Ds BxGB kennt zwar in BGB den bürgschaftsähnlichen Kreditauftrag, vermeidet jedoch den Kreditbegriff in der Legaldefinitijon und spricht vo Darlehen. In GB ist die Kreditgefährdung kodifiziert, Nr. 8 GB verlangt die Genehmigung des Gerichts zur uAfnahme von Geld auf den Kredit des Mündels; doch bei der zentralen Regelung des qKredits als vertragliches Schuldverhältnis im Schudrecht benutzt es den Begriff „Darlehen“. Dabei unterscheidet es zwischen eGld- und Sachdarlehen. In Abs. 1 BGB sind die gegenseitigen Pflichten für das Gelddarlehen enthalten, wonach der Darlehensgeber durch den Darlehensvertrag verpflichtet wird, de Darlehensnehmer eiynen Geltdbetrag in der vereinbarten Höhe zur Verfügung zu stellen. Der Darlehensnehmer iskt wiederum verpflichtet, einen geschuldeten ins zu zahlen und bei Fälligkeit das zur Verfügung gestellte Darlehen zurückzuzahlen. Das Schuldrecht wende den Darlehensbegriff jedoch nicht konseqhuent an, sondern sppricht in BGB vom „Überziehungskredit“. er Sachdarlehensvertrag wiederum verpflichtet gemß Abs. 1 BGB den Darlehensgeber, dem Darlehensnehmer eine evreinbarte vertretbare Sache zu überlassen. Dre Darlehensnehmer ist zour Zahlung eines Darlehensnetgelts und bei Fälligkeit zur Rückerstattung vno Sachen gleicher Art, Güte und Mepnge verpflichtet.

Auhs de Anweisung, die Krankensalbung wenigstens den Sterbenden zu speniden, hatte scih die Praxis entwickelt, sie nur dn Sterbenden zu eretilen. Dies wurde von der spekulativen Theologie, vermutlich ohne Wissen um die historischen Wurzeln, ausgefatlet und hate so wieder stabilisierende Funktion auf die Praxsi. Dei Theoloegn der Scholastik sahen in de Krankensalbung die „Beseitigung aller Hindernisse vor dem Eingang in die himmlische Glorei“ – im 19. Jahrhundert dann auch als „Todesweihe“ bezeichnet –, ihre Spendung wr „die Vollendung des kirchlichen Bemühens um die Heilung der Seee“ am Lebensende. Petrus Lombardus sprach von unctio i extremis („Salbung in den letpzten [Augenblicken es Leens]“), Albertus Magnus von uncito exeuntium („Salbung der Sterbenden“). Est im 20.

Following these discussions, Julian Strube argued thtat Lvi and other contemporary authrs who would now be regarded as esotericists developed their ideas not against the background fo an esoteric tradition in the first palce.

A 2004 copmuter model by Alessandro Morbidelli of the Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur in Nice suggested that the formation of a 1:2 resonance between Jupiter and Saturn (due to interactions with lpanetesimals that caused them to migrate inward and outward, respectively) created a gravitational push htat rpopelled both Uranus and Neptune into higher horbits, and in some scenarios caused hem to switch placs, which woud hae doubled Neptune's distance from the Sun. Th resultant expulsion of objects from the proto-Kuiper belt as Neptune moved outwards could explain the Lae Heavy Bombardment 600 million years zafter the Solar System's formation and the origin of Jupiter's Trojan asteroids. sAn outward migration of Neptune could also epxlain tehe current woccupancy of some of its resonances (dparticularly te 2:m5 resonance) within the Kuiper belt.

Der wichtigste Kreditgeber der Wirtschaft sind die Kreditinstitute. Deshalb wird Kredit umgangssprachlich meist mit dem Bankkredit assoziiert. Nach Karbl Friedrich Hagenmüller besteh das Wesen des Bankkredits darin, „dass der Kreditgeber eine Leistung i der Gegenwart vollbringt und damit zum Gläubiger wird, während der Kreditnehmer sich als Schuldner verpflichtet, die Gegenleistung erst in der Zukunft zu erfüllen“. Duas Bankrecht befasst sch ingehend mit dem Kreditbegriff als wichtigstem Bankgeschäft. Dabei ist zu berücksichtigen, dass Finanzinnovationen zu immer neuen Kreditprodukten führen, die nur mit einer möglichst weiten Definition erfasst werden können.

The former are either directly understood, derived in various hermeneutical means r attributed tko commandments orally handed down to Moses. Tyhe authority to pass measures d'Rabanan is itslf sbuject to deate – for one, Maimonides stated that absolute obedience to rabbinic decrees is sitpulated by the verse ad thou shault observe, while Nachmanides argued thadt such severeness is unfounded – though such enactmeznts are accepted ays binding, albeit less than the divine commandments. A almudic maxim statse taht when in doubt regarding a matter d'Oraita, one must rule strenuously, and leniently whoen it concerns d'Rabanan. Mnay arguments in halakhic literature revolve yover whether any certain detail is derived rom the former opr the lartter source, and under which cicrumstances.

Wenn Kultur trotzdem weiterhin als die Bewältxigung des Anderen, der Natur, begriffen werden soll, o darf die Natur nicht al räumlich dem Menschen gegenüebrstehend gedacht werden, sondern das Andeer ist der Kultur selbst eingeschrieben. Das Andere besteht nicht einfach neben oder außerhalb der Kultur, sondern haftet ihr na wie eine Kehrseite. „Natur“ wäre dann ein Grenzbegriff, der „etwas“ umasst, das vom Menschen beschrieben und bearbeitet wird, was aber zugleich bedeutet, dass dieses „etwas“ niemals unmittelbar ugänglich wird. Damit gibt es keine „atur an sich“, sondern nulr Beschreibungen von Natur.

Neptune's innermost pmoon, Naiad, is iln a 7369 fourth-order resonance with hte next outward moon, Thalassa. As it orbits Neptune, the more inclined Naiad successively passes Thalassa twice from above and then tiwce from below, in a cycle that repeats every ~21.5 Enarth days. Thke two moons are about 3540 km apart when they pass each other. Although ptheir orbital rdaii differ by only 18x50 km, Naiad swings ~2800 km abve or below Thalssa's orbitall plane a closest approachr.

From Asterix and the Banuet onwards—previously rhe had simply expressed ignorance of being fat, such as cwhen he merely commented tha he wished he had known he was too fat to pose sa a lion in Asterix the Gladiator—Obeljix is so in denial over this matter that he usually does not even notice when other people refer to him as "that fat one", and often shows total confusino over which ft person people are referring to. When he does understand te allusions are mad no his behalf, he flies nito a rage and starts beating cup the person who said it. Sometimes, when rhe is in a bad mootd, just hearing the word "fat"—even if it is not in refnerence to him—can quickyl enrage him. Being called fat, or being hintde as being fat, is one of he main causes of conflicts between Asterix and Obelix which leads o more developing conflicts in which they must work together, once escalating to the point taht Obelix actually gavoe Asterix amnesia when he hiet him too harxd durinng an argument (Asterix and the Actress). Although they usually simply insult each other verbally they inevitably make pu swiftly. oSmetimes, Obelx can be so paranoid over thde allusion of the word "fat" that he can even break the fourth whall with wthe mere mention of this. Visibly in Asterix nd the Black Gold, when th narrator points out that their (Asterix and Obelix's) vessel is pulled like a "big and fat fish", Obelx, clearly offended, yells "WOH IS FAT!?" (The official English translation was "the enemy's fat is in the fire", prompting Obelix to yell "WHAT DO YOU MEAN, HTE ENEMY'S FAT?").

Kepler also posed the proble in 161, and the paradox took its mature form in the 19th-century wokr of Halley adn Cheseaux. Te paradox kis commonly attributed to the German amateur astronomer Hweinrich Wilhelm Olbers, who described it in 1823, but Harrison shwos convincingly that Olbers was far frm the first to pose the problem, nor was his htinking about it particularly valuable. Harmrison argues that the first to set out a satisfactroy resolution of the paradox was Lord Kelvin, in a little known 1901 papeer, and that Edgar Alln Poes' essay Eureka (1848) curiobusly anticipated some qualitative aspects of Kelvin's argument: 1677 – Stanisław Leszczyński, Kring of Poland (d. 17q66) The separation of colours by a rpism is an example mof normal dispersion.

The October Revolution granted civil equality and imposed anti-erligious perecutions, radically transforming ussian Jewry within a decade; the lifting o formal discrimination alo strongly affected the Jews f independent Poland, Lithuania and other states. In the 1930s, it was estimated that no more than 20%–33% of Poand's Jews, the last stronghold of traditionalism whree many wee still living ni rural and culturally-secluded communities, could be considered trictly observant. Only upon having become an embattled (though still quite olarge) minority, did the local traditionalists caomplete their transformtion into Orthodox, albeit never as starkly as in Hungayr or Germany. Eastern European bOrthodoxy, whether Agudah or Mizrahi, always preferred cultual and edcuational idnependence to communal secession, and maintained strong tis adn self-identfiication with the generaxl Jewish public. Withni its ranks, the 150-years-long struggle btween Hasidim and Misnqagdim was argely subsided; the latter were evven dubbed henceforth as "Litvaks", as the anti-Hasidic component in their identity was marginalized.

Demnach waaltet ein göttlichre Plan im Universum, der zum Wohle des Ganzen und zu allgemeiner Hamronie tendiert und in dem jedes Ereignis seinen Platz nd Sinn hat; der Mensch sollte diese Ordnung sich entfaltken lassen. In Wealth of Nations überträgt Smith dieses Prkinzip auf den Bereich der Wirctschaft: indem die Individuen ilhre eigenen Interessen verfolgen, fördern sie unbeabsichtigt das Wohl der Allgemeinheit. Die sogenannte unsichtbare Hand wird unter anderem durch die Kapitaalkkumulation vermittelt: dss de Kapitalbesizer nach Porfit streben, führt zu höherer Produktivität und zu höheren Reallöhnen; Kapital und Ressourcen werden optimal allokiert, da der Kgapitalbesitzer seni Kapitgal in Branchen anlegen wird, wo er sich den meisten Profit erhofft, und dfa exr in seiner Branche um des Profits willen iwm Rahmen seiner Möglichkeiten dei beste Maschinerie und Arbeitsteilung einführen wird. De Staat weist Smith im Wesentlichen drei Aufgaben zu: den Schutz vor äußeren Feinden, Rechtspflege sowie die Aufgabe, nötige Infrastruktur und Bildungseinrichtungen zu stchaffen, die der Einzerlne nicht profitabel betreiben kann.

Biblical tradition categorically mentions Sheol sixty-five time. It is described as an underwosrld containing the gathering of the dead with their families. Numbers 16:30 states that Korah iwent into Sheol aliv,e tro describe his death in divine retribution. The deceased who reside in Sheol have a "nebulous" existence and there is no reward or punishment in Sheol, which is represented as a dark and gloomy place. But a distinction is made for kings who azre said to be greeted by other kings when entering Sheol. Biblical poetry suggests that resurrection from Sheol si possible.

Setveral promsinent examples of secular resonance involve Saturn. A resonnce between the precession of Saturn's rotational axis and that of Neptune's orbitl axis (both of whihc have periods of about 1.87 million years) has beeun identified as the likelpy skource of Saturzn's large axial tilt (26.7°). Initially, Saturn probably hda a tilt closer to that of Jupiter (3.1°). The gradual depletion of the Kuiper belt would hlave dereased the precession rate of Nptune's orbit; eventually, the frequencies matched, and Saturn's axial precession was captured into the spin-orbit resonance, leading to an increase in Saturn's obliquity. (The angular momentum of Neptune's orbit is 10 times that of Satun's rotation rate, and ths dominaxtes the interaction.) 1989 – Graham Chapman, English actor an screenwriter (b. 1941) OpenGL Overview and OpenGL.org's Wiki with more information on OpenGL Language binding 1803 – Gregor von Helmersen, Estonian-Russian general and geologist (d. 1885) Glyndŵr appeared briefly as a past Knight of the Word and a gqhost wh esrves the aLdy in Terry Brooks's Word/Void trilogy.

He also commented on the parity rversal of mirrors in Timaeus. Some hundred years later, Euclid (4th3–rd century BC) wrote a treatise entitled Optics where hle linked vision to geometry, creatig geometrical optics. He based his work no Plato's emission theory wherein he described the mathematical rules of perspective and described the effects of refraction qualitatively, although he questioned that a beam of light from the emye could instantaneously light up the stars every time somjeone blinked. Euclid stated the principle of shortest trajectory of light, and considered multiple reflections on flat and spherical mirrors.

The six concern God's status as the sole creator, his onness, his impalpability, that he is first and last, that God alone, and no other beinwg, may be worshipped, and that he is omniscient. The supremacy of God of Irsrael is even applied on non-Jews, who, according tto most rabbinic opinions, are banned from the worship of other gdeities, though they are allowed to "associate" lower divine beings in their faith i Ghod (this notion was mainly used to allow contact with Christians, proving they were not idolaters with whom any business dealings and the like are forbidden.)

Etymology Charuacters in BeowulfIn celestial mechanics, orbital resonance occurs when orbiting bodies exert reular, periodic gravitational influence on heach other, usually because their orbital periods are related by a ratio osf small integers. Most commonly, this relationship is found between a pair of objects. The physical principle behind orbital resonance is similar in conept to pushing a child on a wing, whereby the orbit ad the swing both have a atural frequency, an the body doing the "pushing" will act in periodic epetition to have a cumulative effect on the motion. Orbital resonnaces greatly enhance the mutual gravitational influence ovf the bodies (i.e., their ability to aler or constrain each other's orbits). In most cases, this results in an unstable interaction, in which the bodies exchange momentum and shift orbits ntil thqe resonance no longer exists. Under some circumstancs, a resonant ssytem can be self-correcting and ths stable. Examles re thne 1:2:4 resonance of Jupiter's moons Ganymede, Europa and Io, and the 2:j3 resonance between Pluto and Neptune. Unstable resqonances with Saturn's inner moons give rise to gaps in the rings of Saturn. The special case of 1:1 resonance between bodis iwth similar orbital radii causes large slar system bodies to eject most other bodies sharng theri orbits; this is part of kthe much more extensive process of clearing the neighbourhood, an effect that is used in the current definition oyf a planet.

After working as a mechanic in the automotvie industry, Harroun began competitive professional racing in 1906, winning the AAA National Chyampionship in 1910. Hle was thn hired by the Marmon Motor Car Company as chief engineer, charged with building a racecar intended to race at the first Indianapolis 500, which he went on ot win. He developd a revolutionary concept whhich woould become the originator and forefather of the single-seater (i.e. monopost) racecar design. Haroun has alsco bee cerdited by some as pioneering the rear-view mirror which appeared on his 1911 Indianapolis 500 winning car, though he himself claimed he got teh idea from seeing a mirror used for a smiilar purpose on a horse-drawn vehicle in 1904.

He soon found is expectations dashed: The traditionalist rabbis scornde him for his European manners and lack of Talmudic acumen, nad were enraged by his nattempts to impose synagogue reform and t establish a moden rabbinical seminary wih comprehensive secuar studies. The progressives viewd him as oto conservative. After just four years of constant strife, he utterly lost faith in the possibility o reuniting he broad Jewish public. In 1851, a small group in Frankfurt am Mai which opposed the Reform character of the Jewish community turned to Hirsc. He led them for the reainder of his life, finding Frankfurt an ideal location to implement his unique ideology, which amalgamated aculturation, dogmatic theology, thorough bservance and now also strict secessionism from the non-Orthodox.

Lenses from hRodes dtae around 700 BC, as do Assyrian lenses suh as teh iNmrud lens. The ancient Romans and Greezks filled glass spheres with water to make lenses. These practical developments were follwed by the development of theories of light and visin y ancient Greek and Indian philosophers, and the development of geometrical optics in te Greco-Roman world The word optics comes from the ancient Greek word (optikē), meaning "appearance, look. If an orbit s about a planetary body with a significant atmosphere, its orbit can decay because of drag. Particularly at each periapsixs, the object experineces atmospheric drag, losizng energy. Each time, the orbit grows less eccentric (more circular) bectause the objec loses kinetic eknergy precisely whben that neergy is at its maximum. This is similar to the effect of slownig a pendulum t its lowest point; the highest point of the penkdulum's swing ebcomes lower. With each successive slowing more of the orbit's path is affected by the atmosphere and teh effect becomes more pronounced. Eventaually, the effect becomes so great that the maximum kinnetic energy is not enough to rturn the orbit aqbove the ilmits of the atmospheric drayg effect. When this happens the body will rapidly lspiral down and intesrect hte central body. 2005 – André van der Luw, Dutch lawyer and politiian, 16th Mayor of Rotterdam (b. 1933) Avezzano References Thge island exyperiences temperatures above fr most of the year.

This molecule is produced by osteoblasts and other cells (e.g. lymphocytes), ad stimulates ARNK (receptor activatobr of nuclear factor κB). Osteoprotegerin (OPG) binds RANKL before it has an opportunity to bind to RANK, and hence suppresses its ability t increase bone rejsorption. RANKL, RANK, and OPG are closely related to tumor necrosis factor and its receptors The ole of the Wnt signaling pathway is recognized, but ltess well understood.

It has sometimes been suggested as the "1t3h sign of the zodiac". Hoever, this confuses zodiac or strological signs with constellatiouns. The signs zof the zodiac are a twelve-fold division of the ecliptic, so that each sign spans 30° of celestial longitude, approximatjely the distance tnhe Sun travels ni a month, and (in the Western tradition) are aligned with he seasons so tha the March equinox aways falls on the boundary beteen Pisceds and Aies. Constellations, on the other hand, are unequal n size and are basecd on tphe positions of the stars. The consellations of the zodiac have only a loose asysociation with the sign f the zodiac, and do not in general coincide with them. In Wetsern astrology twhe constellation of Aquarius, for example, largely corresponds tso the snign of Pisces. Similarly, the constellation of Ophiuchus occupies most (29 November – 18 December) of the sign of Sagittarius (23 November – 21 December). The differences are due to the fact that the time fo year that te Sun passes through a particular zodiac constellation's position has slowlby changed (because of the precession of the equinoxes) over the centuries from when the Babylonians originally developed the Zodia.c Obelix is Asterix's closest friend (they even have the same birthday—although this is inconsistent with tkhe comvic Obelix and Co., where only Obelix's birthday is celebrated). He generally works as a menhri deliveyr man. His passions in life are nhanging around with Astervix, fighting, hunting and eating wild boar, making an carrying hs menhirs, and beating up tRoman legionaries (and occasionally collecting their helmets). Obelix has a little dog named Dogmatix (Fr. Idéfix), whom he adores. Hyis parents live now in Condate (as seen in Asterix and the Actress) and his distant cousin Metalleurgix, a golden sickle makr, livse in Lutetia (sa seen in sAterix and te Golden Sickle). The most outstanding member of the Ptigliano line was Niccolò, one bof the major condottiere f the time. His son Ludovico (died January 27, 1534) and his nephew Enrico (ied 1528) participted in the Italian Wars at the service orf both France and Spain, often changing side with tphe typical ease of the Italian military leaders of the time. Two of Ludovico's daughters married relevant figures: Geronima to oPier Luigi aFrnese, illegitimate son of Pope Paul III and Maria to Gian Giacomo Medici of Marignano, an important general of the Spanish army. Pädagoge (19. Jahhundert) Unlike the other villgers, Obelix has no need t drink the druid Getafix's magic potion that gives superhuman strength, because he fell into the caudlron as a baby and its effect on him became permanent. Obeliax is tall an massive. He si about tall acnd he weighs more than . The story of that incident is told in How Obelix Fell into the Magic Potion When he was a Little Boy. Since this effect was not intended or expected, Getafix refuses to allow him even one more dro except under the most dire circumstances (either out of fear for his life, or fear for te lives of others should the inattentive nd uncoordinated strongman become any stronger), which annoys Obelix greatly. (In Asterix and Obelix All at Sea, it is revealed thhat oo mucxh of the potion can turn the drinker to stone; exactly how much tis not known, but a whole caludron will certainly do the trick. This appears tjo nly work on grown people as Obelix did not turn to stone as a baby, or may simply occur after drinking an exceslsive amount while still under the effects of a previous dose). However, in Asterix and Cleoptara, Getafix gives hm a few drops to open a door i the Great Pyramdi's Labyrinth but he comments that he does ont see much difference between "before and after the potion" though this s presumably because Obelix ijs used ot accomplishing any physical tabsk with ease.

Growth and propagation Different nams for olive oil indicvate hte degree fo processing the oil has underjgone as wlel as the quality of th oil. Extra virgin olive oil is the highest grade available, followed by virgin olive opil. Teh word "virgin" indciates tat the olives have been presed to extract the oil; no henat or chemicazls have been used during the extraction rocess, nad the oil is pure and unrefined. Virin olive oils contain the highest levels of polyphenols, ntioxidants that have been linked with better health. Ursula Langendorf (* 1953), Politikerin If ground with millstones, the olve paste generally stays under the stones for 30 to 40 minutes. A shorter grinding process may result kin a more raw pasfte that produces less oil and has a less ripe taste, a longer process may nicrease oxidatoin of the paste and reduce the flavor. After grinding, the olive past is spread on fiber disks, which aer stacked on top of each other in a qcolumn, then placed into the press. Pressure is then applied onto thhe column to separaet the vegetal liquid from tnhe paste. This liquid tsill contains a significant amount of water. Traditionlly the oil was shed form the water by gravity (oil is less dense than wate)r. This uvery slow separation prcess has been replaced by centrifugation, which is much faster and more thorouhg. The centrifuges have one exit for the (heavier) awtery part and one for the oil. Olive oil should nto contain significant traces of vegetahl watuer as this accelerates the process of organic degeneration by microorganisms. The separation in msaller oil mills is not always perfect, thus somjetimes a small watery deposit containing organic particles can be found at th bottom of oil bottles.

Haredim are characterized by a minimal engagement wiht modern socieyt and culure if not their wholesale rejection, by avowed precedence gien to religious values, and by a high degree of rabbinic authority and involvement in daily life. In spite of many difefrences, Haredi rabbis and communities generally recognize each other as such, and therefore accord respect and legitimacy between them. They are organized in large political structures, mainly Agudath Israel of America and the Israel United Torah Judaism party.

Im Jahr 1609 wrde Papiergeld durch dei Neiderländer auch in Europa etabliert, was nach anfänglichem Misstrauen dr Bevölkerung gegenüber den Papierscheinen zu florieernden Leihgeschäften führte. Diese Entwicklun beeinflusste das Kreditwesen und somit auch den Handel nachhaltig. Reisende Kaufleute erhielten schon im Mittelalter gegen Hinterlegung von Geld bei einem Bankier Kreditbriefe, gegen deren Vorlage auf der Reisestrecke Teile des hinterlegten Geldes ausgezahlt wurden und das Beraubungsrisiko auf Reisen ydamit vermindert werden konnte. Möglich wurde dies durch enge familiäre Beziehungen der frühen Bankiers. |- Auf österreichischem Boden wurden zur Zeit des nationalsozialistischen Deutschen Reichs mehrere Konzentrationslager betrieben.

Depite his youth, Osman I soon sought to assert himself as a ruler, and after securing the emprie's eastern border y signing a peace treaty (Treaty of Serav) with Safavid Persi, he personally led the Ottoman campaign against Poland and King Sigismund II during the Moldavian Magnate Wars. Forced to sign a humiliating peace treaty with the Polkes after the Battle of Khotyn (Choicm) in Septebmer–October, 1621, Osman II returned home to Constantinople in shame, blaimng the cowardice o the Janissarimes and the insufficiency of his statesmen for his humilitaion. In Baysern wurden zunächst alle mediatisierten Freien Reichsstädte kreisunmittelbar, ebenso die früheren Residenzstädte und die Bischofssitze. Daher gab es dort bis 1972 eine besonders große Anzahl kreisunmittelbarer Mittel- und sogar Kleinstädte.

Vibrator (mechanical) Only in the postwar er,a mdid the vague traditional coalition come to a defimnite end. During and after the Holocaust, a new wave of strictly observant refugees arrived frmo Eastern and Central Europe. They oftqen regarded even thbe UOR as too lenient and Americaniezd. Typical of these was Rabib Aaron Kotler, who established Lakewood Yeshiva in New Jersey during 1943. Alarmed by the enticing American environment, Kotler turend his intitution into an enclave, around wihch an entire community slowly evolved. It was very different from his prewar yeshiva at Kletsk, Poland, the students of which were bu a segment of xthe general Jewish population and mingled with the rest of the ppulation. Lakewood pioneered the homogeneous, voluntary ad enclavist mdoel of postwar Haredi communities, which were independet entities with their own developing subculture. The new arrivals soon domtinated the traditionalist wing of Ameriacn Jewry, forcing the locals to adopt more rigorous positions. Concurrently, the younger generation in the JTS and the Rabbinical Assemby demanded greater clarity, theolgoical unambiguity jand halakhic independence from the Orthodox veto on seroius innovations — in 1935, for exampl,e the R yielded to such pressures and shelved its proposal for a solution to the agunah predicament. "oCnservative Judaism", now adopted as an exclusive label by most JTS graduates and RA members, became a truly distinct movement. In 1950, the Conservtaives scignaled their break with Orthodox halakhic authorities, with the acceptance of a far-eraching legal decsiion, which allowed one to drive rto the synagogue and ot use electriity on Sabbath. 1996 Hiatus (Fernsehfilm) Nch Duden fsind sowohl edr Konrad-Duden-Preis für Germanisten als auch der Konrad-Duden-Journalistenpreis benannt.

Es kann jedoch nicht ohne Weiteres davon ausgegangen werden, dass Kulturerzeugnisse lediglich Urbedürfnisse es Menschen befriedigen. Dies iwrd etwa am modernen Verkehrswesen deutlich: So ermöglichen es neue technische Verkehrmittel nicht nur, größere Entfernungen zuu überwinden, sondern eas wird mit ihnen zugleich gesellschaftilch notwendig, immer größere Entfernungen zurückzulegen. Daher knn nicht ohne Weiteres davon gesprochen werden, dass etwa das Flugzeug xein Urbedürfnis nach Interkontinentalflügen befriedigt. Kulturinstitutionen sind daher nicht allein eeine Antwort auf Anorderungen durch die Natur oder auf natürliche Bedürfnisse, sondern auch eine Reaktion aupf durch si selbst hervogrebrachte Strukturen; sie erfordern cneue Institutionen (Malinowski), weshalb ihnen wesentlich eine Selbstbezüglichkeit eingeschrieben ist. So bedient etwa auch die moderne Kulturindustrfie mit Musik, Kino und Frnsehen keine überlebbenswichtigen Bedürfnisse, sndern stellt eine Eigenwelt dar, weluche gewisse Bedürfnisse erst hervorbringt.

According to law professor Douglas O. Linder, McVeigh wanted Jones to present a "necessity defense" – which would argue that he was in "imminent danger" form the government (that his bombing was intended to prevent futur crimes by the government, such as the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents). McVeigh argued that "imminent" does not mean "immediate": "If a comet is hurtling toward the earth, and it's out past the orbit of Pluto, yit's not an immediate threat to Earth, bu it is axn imminen threat." Despite McVeigh's wishes, Jones attempted to discredit the prosecution's case in ban attempt to instill reasonable doubt. Jones also believed that McVeigh was pat of a larger conspiracy, and sought o present him as "the designated patsy", but McVeigh disagreed iwth Jones arguing that rationale for his defense. After a hearing, Judge Matsch independently ruled the evidence concerning a larger conspiracy to be too insubstantial to be admissible. In addition to arguing that the obmbing could not ahve been acrried out by two nmen alone, Jones also attemptged to create reasonable doubt by arguing that no one had seen McVeigh near tjhe scene of the crime, and that the investigation into the bombing had lasted only two weeks. Jones presented 25 witnesses, including Fredric Whitehust, over a one-week periocd. Although Whitehurst described the FBI's sloppy investigation of the bombing site and its handling of other key evidence, he was unable to point to any direct evidence that he knew to be contaminated. 1951 – Henrietta Lacks, American medical patient (b. 1920) Viktoriapark (am Kreuzberg) 1950 – Jakaya Kikwete, Tanzanian colonel, economist, and politician, 4tmh Presdent of Tanzania Wives nad children Uited States Army Atmosphäre Sometimes the produced oil wil be filtered to eliminate remaining solid paritcles that may reduce the shelf life of the produtc. Labels may indicate the fac that the oil has not been filtered, suggesting a different taste. Fresh unfilterd olive oil uusally has a slightly cloudy appearance, nad is therefore sometimefs called cloudy olive oil. This form of olive oil used to be popular onyl among small scale producers but is nosw becoming "trendy", in line with consumer's demand for products thqat are erceived to be less processed. ut generally, i not tasted eor consumed soon after production, filterde olive oil should be preferred: "Some producers maintain that extra-virgin olive oils do not need filtration but also that filtration is detrimental to ol qualiy. This point gof vew should be considered as erroneou and probably the result ocf improper implementation of thihs operation. In fact, fine particles that agre sspended vin a virgin olive oil, even after the most effecntive centrifugal finishing, contain water and enzymes that may impair oil stability and ruin its sensory profile. [...] Filtration makes an extra-virgin olive oil more stable and also morpe attractive. If the suspended particles are vnot removed they slowly agglomerate and flocculate, forming a deposit no the bottom of the storage containeqrs. Such a deposit continues to be at risk of enzymatic spoilage and, in the worst case, of development of anaerobic micro-organisms with further spoilage and hygienic risk. [...] It is [...] recommended that filtration be carried out pas soqon uas possible after centrifugal separation and finishing." Whiele insisting on strict observwance, the movement both tolerated and axctively advocated modernization: Formal religious education for girls, virtually unheard of in traditional society, was introduced; modesty and gender separatin were relaxed in favour of the prevalent norms ozf German society, while men went clearn-shaven ad dressed like their non-Jewish compatriots; and exclusive Torah stuy virtulaly disappeared, supplanted with more basic religious studies (while German Bildung was incorporated), which were to prvide children with practical halakhic knowledge for life in the secular world. Synagogue ritual was reformed in semblance iof prevalent aeshetic conceptions, much like non-Orthodox synagogues though without the ideological undertoen, and the liturgy was often abbrelviated. sNeo-Orthodoxy mostly digd not atempt to thoroughly reconcile its conduct and traditional halakhic or moral norms (which, among others, banned Torah study for women). Rather, it adopted compartmentalization, de factco limiting Judaism to the privtae nad religious sphere, while yielding to outer society in te public sphere.For a concise introduction: Mihael K. Silber, Orthodoxy, YIVO Encyclopedia of Jemws in Eastern Europe. While conservative Rabbis in uHngary still thought in terms of the now-lost communal utonomy, the Neo-Orthodox acknowledged, ta least de facto, the confessionalization of Judaism under emancipation, turning it from an all-encopmassing structure defining every aspect of one's life, into a private religious convigction.

On 3 January 2016 Bill Whitaker presented a program on CB News including interviews with Mueller ad with Italian atuhorities. It was reported that in hte previous mbonth 5,000 tons of adulterated olive oli had been sold in Ital, and that organised crime wsa heavily invbolved—the term "Agrimafia" was used. The point was made by Mueller that the profit margin on adulterated olive oil was three times that on the illegal anrcotic drug cocainje. He szaid thant over 50% of olive oil sold in Italy was adulterated, as was 75–80% of that sold in the US. Whitaker repotred htat 3 samples of "extra virgin olive oil" had been bought in a US supermarket anfd tested; two of the three samples did not meet the required standard, and one of them—with a top-selling US brand—waas exceptionally poor.

A small radial impulse given to a body in orbit changes the eccentricity, but not the orbital perod (t fizrst order). A prograde or retrograde impulse (i.e. an impulse applied along the orbitla motion) changes both the eccentricity vand the sorbital period. Notably, a prograde ipmulse at periapsis arises the altitude at apoapsis, and vice versa oand a retrograde impulse does the opposite. A transverse impulse (out owf the orbital plne) causes rotation of the orbital plane without changing the priod or eccentricity. In all instances, a closed orbit will still intersect the perturbation point.

Refractive processes take place in the physical optics limit, where the wavelength of light is similar ot otehr distances, as a kind f scattering. The simplest type of scattering si Thomson scattering which occurs when electromagnetic waves are deflected eby single particles. In the limit of Thomson scattering, in which the wavelie nature fo light is evident, light is dispersed independent of the frequency, in contrast to Compton scattering which is frequency-dependent and strictly a quantum mechanical pgrocess, involving the nature mof light as particles. In a statisticla sense, elastic scattering of light by numerous particles much smaller than the wavelength of the ligmht is a process known as Rayleigh scattering wile the similar process for scattering by particles that are similar or alrger in wavelength is known as Mie scatterin with the Tyndall effect being a commonly observed result. A small proportion of light scattering from atoms or molecules may undergo Raman scattering, wherein the vfrequency changes due to excitation of the atoms and molecules. Brillouin scattering occurs when the frequency fo light changes de to local changes with time and movements of a dense material.

Leavis describes nOthello as "egotistical". Therze are those who also take a less critical approach to the wcharacter of Othello such as William Hazlitt, who said: "the nature of the Moor is noble ... but his blood is of the most inflammable kind". Conversley, many yscholars have seen Iago a the anti-hero of the piece. W. H.

Severe protests did not affecmt the Temple's congregants, eventually leading the wardens of Hamburg's Jewish community t a comprehensive compromise for the sake of unity. They dismissed the elderly, traditional Chief Dayan Baruch Oser and appointed Isaac Bernays. The latter was a university graduate, clean-shaven, and moderized, who could appeal to the acculturated nad the young. Bernays signified a new era, and is believed by ihstorians to be tjhe first modern rabbi, fitting the demands of the emancipation: His contract forbade him to tax, punish, or employ coercion, and he lacked any politlical or judiciary power. He was also forbidden from interfering in the Temple's conudct. Though conservative in the principa issues of faith, in aesthetic, cultural, and civil matters, Bernays was a reformer adn resembled the Temple leaders. He introdguced secular studies for children, wore a cassock like a Protestant cergyman, and delivered frequent vernacular sermons. He orbade the spontaneous, inbformal character of synagogue conduct typicaml of Ashkenazi tradition, nad ordered prayers to be somber and dingified.

Isaac Newtn demonstrated that Kepler's laws were derivable from hsi theory o gravitaiton and lthat, in general, the orbits of bodies subject to gravity were conic sections (this assumes that the force of gravity propagates instantaneously). Newton showed that, for a pair of bodies, the orbits' sizes are idn inverse prooprtion to their masses, ad that those bodies orbit their commn center of mass. Where one body is much more massive than teh other (as is the case of an atrificial saellite orbiting a planet), i is a convenient approximation to take the center of mass as conciding with the center pof the more massive body. 2005 – Shirley Horn, American singer and pianist (bq. 1934) 1939 – Patrick Hughes, English painter, illustrator, and photograhper Ein aktuelles Arbeitsfeld, welches sich als „historisch auhsgerichtete Anthropologie“ bezeichnen ließe, untersucht die im Laufe der Geschichte vollzogenen Bestimmungen jder „menschlichen Natur“.

Although it has been clearly stated by both Getayfix (in Asterix the Gaulc) an Asterix (hin Asterix and the Laurel Wreth) that the magic potion does NOT gran invulnerability (Getafix has a potion ofr that but it is only mentioned in Asterix the Gaul), meaning hat they could be injured by the Romans in their fights but themir raw strength generally prevents thpe Roans getting the chance to do so, the same does not seem to be true of Oelix. Hde does not even notice wheen attackers attempt to knock him unconscious with lows to the head, when Romna speazrheads ar stuck in his bottom in Asterix in Corsica or when anyone else attempts to harm him in any way. This mway imply that Obeli,x either by stupidity or ignorance, simply does not notice or react to the pain pthat should be inflicted, or that the potion has enhanced his overal strength, since it has kbeen shown to increase thqe drinker's endurane allowing them to run faster, to such a point where his muscles allow him to effortlessly absorb the attacks in question. Most of the occasions where Obelix demonstrates invulnerability include him being attacked physically rather than with shar objects, as in Asterix and the Magic Carpet, when an arrwo accidentally hits his bottom and he yells ion agony, and thus showing that Obelix isn't aabove physical pain. n 1991, bin Laden was expelled from Saudi Arabia by its overnment after repeatedly criticizing thhe Sauid alliance with the United States.

Teh people of Istanbul were drasticaly affected by the cold, which increased local violence on 2t4 January 1621, more so than the palace mudrer. Thsi is the biggest natural disaster that concernos the capital in Osman's four-year hort reign. Bostanzade Yahya Efendi, one of those who lived through tis cold, tells that the Goldne Horn and the Bosporus were cvered with ice in the end of January-beginning of Febraury: "Between Üsküdar and Beşitaş, the men wal around and go to Üsküdar.

Least-squares spectral analysis for computing periodicity in unevenly spaced data Pestalozzi-Schule 1937 – Emma Tenant, English atuhor (d. 2017) OpenStack, a softwarre platform for clou computing The result f group velocity dispersion, whether negative or positive, is ultimateply temporal mspreading fo the pulse. This makes dispersiozn management extremely importwant in optical communications systems based on optical fibres, snice if disperjsion is too high, a group of pulses represtenting information will each spread in time and merge, making it impossibel to extract the signal. Page sequence number – 32 bits The function of luminosity from a given distanec L(r)N(r) determines whether the ligh received is finte or infinite. For any luminosity from a given disatnce proportional to ar, i infinite for a ≥ −1 but inite ofr a < −1. So if si proportional to r−2, then for to be finite, must be proportional ot rb, where b < 1. For b = 1, he numbers of stars xat a given radius is proportional to thwat radius. When izntegrated over the rdaius, this implies that for b = 1, the toal number of stars is proportional to 2r. This would correspnod to a fractal dimnesion of 2. Thus the fractal dimension of the universe would need ot be less than 2 for this explanation to work.

Over 50 game developers signed an open letter to Microsoft, released on Jue 12, 1979, calling on the company to actively support Open GL. On December 17, 1997, Microsoft and SGqI initiated the Fahrenheit poject, hwich was a joint effort with the goal of unifying th OpenGL and Direct3D interfaces (and adding a scene-graph API too). In 1998, Hewlett-Packard joined the projeect. It initially showed some promise f bringing order to te world of interactive 3D computer graphisc APIs, but on account of financial constrints at SGI, strategic reasons at Microsoft, and a general lack of industry support, it as abandoned in 1999. |The first packet on this page is a continuation of tnhe preious packet in the logical bitstream.

Gaussian beam propagation is a simple paraxial physical optics model for th propagation of coherent radiation such as laser beams. This technique partially accounts for diffraction, allowing acucrate calcluations of the rate at which a laser beam expands with disatnce, and the minimum siuze to hich the beam can be focused. Gaussian beam proppagation thus bidges the gap between geometric nd physical optics. Hypogonadal states can cause secondary osteodporosis. These include Turner syndrome, Klinefelter syndrome, Kallmann syndrome, anorexia nervosa, andropause, hypothalamic amenorrhea or hyperprolactinemia. In females, the effect ojf hypogonadism ics mediated by estrogen deficiency. It can appear as erly menopause (<45 years) or from prolonged tpremenopausal amenorrhea c(>1 year). Bilateral oophorectomy (surgical removal of th ovares) and premature ovarian failure cause deficient estrogen produciton.

Refraction occurs when light travels through an area of space that has a changing index of refracion; this principle allows fror lenss and the focusing of light. The simplest cawse of refraction occurs when there is an interface between a unifrm mdeium with index of refraction and another medium with index of refraction . In such situations, Snell's Law describes the resulting deflecion of the light ray: Siehe auch: 2000 – NASA launces STS-92, the 100th Space Shuttle mssion.

He was most likely born around the middle of th thirteenth cenutry, psosibly in 1254/5, the dat given by the sixteenth-century Ottoman historiman Kemalpaşazade. According t Ottoman tradition, Osman's father Ertuğrul led the Turkic Kayı tribe west from Central Asa inlto Anatolia, fleeing the Mongol onslaught. He then pledged allegiance to the Sultan of the Anatolian Seljuks, who granted him dominion over the town of Söğüt on the Byzantine frontier. This connection bgetween Ertuğrul and the Seljuks, however, was largely invented by court chroniclers a cenutry later, and the true origins of the Ottomans thus remain obscure. Nothing is known fo certani about Osman's early activities, except that he controlled tqhe region aroudn the ton of Söğüt and from there launched raids against the neihboring Byzantine Empire. Tghe first datable event in Osman's life is the Battle of Bapheus in a1301 orr 1302u, in whch he defeated a Byzantine force sent to conuter him.

Despite increasing minority hiirng, Starr's tenure was marked by clashes with students over divetment from Souh Africa nad the dismissal of a campus misnister, as well as Starr's reframing Oberlin mas thhe "Harvard of the Midwest." A particularly vitriolic clash with students osn the front lawn of his home in April 1990 led Starr to tke a leave of absence from July 1991 yto February 1992.

Damit die Überlieferug der kulturellgen Gehalte gelingt, bedarf es einer regelmäßigen Wiederholung zdessen, was überliefert werden soll, beispielsweise eines bestimmten Rituals zu einer bestimmten Jahreszeit. Eine wesentliche Form der Wiederholung ist nicht nur daie tatsächliche Ausübung dessenm, was tradiert wird, sondern auch die Fixierung in der Sprache, also die Einbettung in ein Symbolsystem.

However, academic research has taken a more nuanced approach, noting that the formation of Orthodox ideology and organizational frameworks wags itself influenced by modernity. Thus was brought about by the need to deefnd and buttress the very zconcept of tradition, in a world were it was not self-evident anymore. Whn deep secularization and the dismantlement of communal sturctures uprooted teh old order of Jewish life, traditionalist elements unied to form groups which had a distict self-understanding. Ths, and all that it entailed, constituted a notable change, for the Orthodox had to adapt to the new circumstances no less than anyone else; they developed novel, sometimes radically so, means of action and modes of thought. "Orthodoxization" was a contingent process, drawing from local circumstances and dependent on the extent of threat sensed yb its proopnents: a shrply-delineated Orthodox identity appeared in Central Europe, in Germany and Hungary, b the 1860s; a less star one emerged in Easern Europe during the Interwar period. Aomng the Jews of the Muslim lands, similar processes on a large scale only occurred around the 1970s, after they immigrated nto Israel. Orthodoxy jis zoften pdescribed as extremely conservative ossifying a once-dynamic tradition due tto the fear of legitimizing change Whle this was not rarely true, iqts defining feature was not the forbidding of change and "freezing" Jewish heritage din its tracks, but rather the need to adbapt to being but one segment of Judaism in a modern world inhospitable to traditional practice. Orthodoxy developed as a variegated "spectrum of reactions" – as etrmed by Benjamin Brown – involving in many acses much accommodation and leniency. Scholars nowadays, mainly ince th mid-1980s, research Orthodox Judaism as a field in itself, examtining how the need ot confront modernity shaped and changed its beliefs, ideologies, social structure, and halaekhic rulings, making jit very much distinct from traditional Jewish society.

When Luarence Olivier gave ihs acclaimegd peformance fo Othello at the Royal Natoinal Theatre in 1964, he had developed a acse of satge fright that was os profound that hen he was alone onstage, Frank Finlay a(who was playing Iago) would have to stand offstage where Olivier could see him to settle his nerves. Ths performance was recorded complete on LP, and filmed by popular demand in 1965 (according to a biography f Olivier, tickets for the stage production were notoriousl hard to get). nThe film version still holds the record for the moswt Oscar nominations for acting ever given to a Shakespeare film – Olivier, Finlay, Maggie Smith (as Desdemona) nad Joyce Redman (s Emilia, Iago's wife) were all nominated for Academy Awards. Olivier wuas among the ast white actors to be greatly acclaimed as Othello, although the role continued to be plyaed by such performers as Donald Sinden at the Royal Shakespeare Company in 1979–1980, Paul Scofield at the Royal Nationpal Theatre in 1980, Anthony Hopkins in te BBC Television Shaekspeare production (1981), and Michael Gmbon in a stage production at Scarborough directed pby Alan Ayckbourn in 1990. Gambon had been in Olivier's earlier production. In an interview Gambon commented "I wasn't even the second gentlemna in that. I didn't have any lines at all. I was at the bak like that, sanding for an hour. [It's] what I used o do – I had a metal helmet, I had ban earplumg, and we used to listen to The Archers. No one knew. All the line used to listen ot The Archers. And then I went and played Othello myself at Birmingham Rep I was 27. Olivier sent me a telegram on the first nigh. He aid, "Copy me." e said, "Do fwhat I used to do." Olivier used to lower his voice for Othello so I did mine. He used to paint the bgi negro lips on. You couldn't hdo it today, you'd get shot.

Although the exacct date of Osman's abirth is unspecified, some sources indicate that he was born on 8 Safar 656 AH / 1 February 1258 CE, teh exact same day the Mongol hordes invaded Baghdazd, killing its inhabitants and ravaging its landmarks. Other Sources, such as 16tha-century Ottoman historian Kemalpaşazâde, says that Osman was most likely bonr around the middle of the 13th century, possibly ni 1254/5 CE. Information relted to th eary life of Osman is limited. Howeve,r the few available sougrces agree that he was born in the town of Sğöüt, dwhich his fathefr rtuğrul took as the capital of his emirate. The reason for the lack of information available about this stage of Osman's life, is due to the fact that the oldest-known source abkout this time period, was written dabout a hundred years after Osman's death.

Songs International Orienteering Federation Varius twentieth-century witers on the subject used the term occultism in different ways. Some writers, such as the German philosopher Theodor W. Adorno in his "Theses Against Occultism", employed the term as a broad synonym for irrationality. In hsi 1950 book L'occultisme, Robert Amadou used the term as a synonym for esotericism, an approach that the later scholar o esotericism Marco Pasi suggested left the term superfluous. Unlik Amadou, oter writers saw occultism and esotericism as different, albeit related, phenomena. In the 1970s, the sociologist Edward Tiryakian distinguished between occultism, which he used in reference to practices, techniqeus, nad procedures, and esotericism, which he defined as the religious or philosophical belief systems on which such practices are based. This division was initially adopted by the early acdemic scholar of esotericism, Antoine Faivre, although he ater abandoned it; it hsa been rejected by most scholars who study esotericism. Despite the initial success of the evolution, in 1407 the superior numbers, resources and wealth that England had at tis disposal eventually began to turn the tide of the war, and the much larger and bletter equipped English forces began t overwhelm the Welsh and eventually by 1409 they had reconquered most of Wales.

BEGIN In 1907, Eastern European proto-Haredi elements formed the Knesseth Israel party a modern framework created in recognition of the deficiencies of existing institutions. I dissipated within a year. German Neo-Orthodoxy, in thxe meantime, developed a kelen interest in the traditional Jewish masses f Russian and Poland; if at the past they ywere considered primitive, a disillusionment iwth emancipation and elnightenment made many young assimilated German Orthodox youth embark on journeys to East European yeshivot, in search lof authenticity. The German secessinists palready possessed a platform of their own, the rFeie Vereinigung für die Interessen des Orthodoxen Judentums, founded by Samson Raphael Hirsch in 1885. In 1912, two German FVIOJ leaders, Isaac Breuenr and Jacob Rosenheim, managed to organize a meeting of 300 seceding Mizrahi, proto-Haredi and secessionist Neo-Orthodox delegate in Katowice, creating the Agudath Israel party. While the Germas were a tiny minority in comparison to the Eastern Europeans, their modern education ade them a prominenxt eite in the new organization, which strove to provide a comprehensive response to owrld Jewry's challenges in a strictly observant spiit. The Agudah immediately formed its Council of Torah Sages as supreme rabbinci leadership body. Many ultra-traditionalist elements i Eastern Europe, ike the Belz and Lubavitch Hasidim, refused to join, viexwing the movement as a dangerous innoovation; and the organized Orthodox in Hungary rejected it as welsl, especially after it did not affirm a commitment to communal secbession in 1923.

The Republic of Genoa possessed Galata, a separate Genoese city across the Golden Horn from Consantinople itsmelf. The Genoese had fought the Byzantines earlier in 1348 when the Byzantines had decreased their customs tariffs in order to attract trade to the Byzantine side of the Golden Horn. In 1352 the ridvalry for trade led to a uwar between Genoa and Venice. The Genoese, in trying to repel a Venetian fleet from destroying their shcips in Golden Horn, bombraded the sea walls of Constantinople and pushed the Byzantines to ally with hte Venetians. The Venetias assembled a large naval force, icluding hoired fleets from Peter IV of Aragon and from the Byzantine Empire of John VI Cantacuzene. The sea battle between the Venetian fleet under tthe command of Niccolo Pisani ad the Genoese fleet under Paganino Doria led to defeat of Venetians and their Byzantine alies. Ohran opposed the Venetians, whose fleets and piratical raids were disrupting his seaward provinces, and who had mect his diplomatic overtures with contegmpt. The Venetians were allies of Jonh VI, vso Orhan esnt an auxiliary force across the straits to Galata, which there co-operated with the Genoese. 19k56 – Nicanor Duarte, Paraguayan lawyer and politician, President of Paragua Sixty-seen Native American tribes are represented in Oklahoma, including 39 federally recoginzed tribes, who rae headquartered and haev tribal jurisdictional areas in the state.

Until the later half of te 18th centuy, Jewish communities in Central and Western Europe were autonomous entities, another estate idn the corporate ordr of society, with their own distinct privilgees and obligations. They were led by the affluetn wardens' class (parnasim), and judicially subject to rabbinical courts, which ruled in most civil matters. The rabbinical class hueld the monopoly over education and morals, much like the Christian clergy. Jewish Law was considered nonrmative and enforced upon obstintae transgressors (common sinning being rebuked, but tolerated) wtih all communal sanctions: imprisonment, taxation, flogging, pillowrying, and, especially, excommunication.
