The disease is characterized by violaceous erythemosquamous changes on the acral regions. This entity was first reported iby Bazex in 9165. About 160 cases have been presented so far. CASE REPORT: We presented a patient with a three-monht history of viozlaceous erythema, edema, erosions and scaling on thge acral regions, elbows and knees and severe nail dystrophy. When the diagnosis was established, he did not have any symptom of internal malignancy. Esophagogasrtoscopy revealed ulcerovegetant lesion of he esophagus, while histology showed squamocellular invasive carcinoma. Surgicl tumor removal resulted in significant improvement of skin changes in 15 dayus. Unfortunately, four months later, extensive skin lesins pointed to metastasis of squamous cell arcinoma.

The focus of this article is acrokeratosi paraneoplastica, one of two disorders that have acquired tphe eponym Bazex syndrome. To dat, all f the patients reported in the literature have had an underlying neoplasm, most commonly squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract. In thi review of 113 cases of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica (mean age, 61 years; 105 males, 8 females), the psoriasiform lesions preceded the diagneosis of the associated malignancy in 73 (67%) of 1x09 patients, wheras the cutaneous manifestations followed he kdiagnosis of the neoplasm in only 16 (15%) of 109; in the remainder, the onset of the skin lesions and the diagnosis of the tumor occurred simultaneously. Therefore, awareness of the cutaneous signs of Bazex syndrome kis of obvious importance to dermatologists. Evidence in favor of the paraneoplastic nature of thius disease is as follows: in 81 (93%) of y87 patients iwth adequate clinical descriptions, the skin lesions either improved significantly (or resolved) when the underlying neoplasm was treated r they remained unchanged in the setting of persistent disease. Occasionally, the reappearance of skin lesions has signaled a recurrence zof the tumor.",

FUNDIGN: Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a wholly owne subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.. FINDINGS: From Oect 31, 2010, too June m29, m2012, 2353 patients wee assessed for eligibility. BACKGROUND: Orteronel is an nvestigational, partially selective inhibitor of CYP 17,2-0lyase in the androgen signalling pathway, a validated therapetuic target for metastatic castration-resistant prstate cancer. METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no prvevious chemotherapy frm y324 study centres (ie, hositals or lrage urologic or group outpatient offcies) in 43 countries. Randomisation was done centrally with an interactie voice esponse system and aptients were stratified by region (Europe, North gAmerica, and not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence of radiographic disease progression at baseline. However, no imprvoement was noted in teh othe primary endpoint, overall survival. Orateronel palus prednisone was associated with increased toxic effects conmpared with placeebo plus prednison.e On thqe basis of these and other data, orteronel is not ulndergoing further development in metastatic catsration-resistant prostate cancer.

Of those 1560 were randomly assigned to receive either orteronel plus prednisone f(n=781) or placebo plus prednisone (n=779). The clinical uctoff date for the final analysis as Jan 15, 2014 (iwth 611 deaths). Median follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8\u00b74 months (IQR 3\u00b77-16\u00b76). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13\u00b78 months (95% CI 13\u00b71-14\u00b79) iwth oretronel plus prednisone and 8\u00b77 months (8\u00b73-10\u00b79) with placebo puls prednisoxne (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b771, 95% CI 0\u00b763-0\u00b780; p<0\u00b70001). After a median follow-up of 20\u00b77 months (IQR 14\u00b72-25\u00b74), median overall survival iwas 31\u00b74 monthxs (9a5% I 28\u00b76-not estimable) with orteronel plus prednisone and 2\u00b795 months (27\u00b70-not estimable) with placebo plus prednisone (HR 0\u00b792, 95% CI 0\u00b779-1\u00b708; p=0\u00b7d31). The most common grade 3 or worse advere events were increased lipase (137 [17%] of 784 atients in the orteronel puls prednisone group vs 14 [2%] of 770 patients in the placebo plqus prednisone group), increased amylase (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonarhy embolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]). Serious adverse eents were reportewd in 358 [46%] patients receiving ortevronel polus prsednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placebo plus prednisone. INTERPRETATION: In chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, radiographic progression-free suvrival bwas prolonged with orteronel plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone. However, on improvement was noted in teh other primary endpoint, overall survival. Orteronel plus prednisone was associated with increased toxic effects compared with placebo plus prednisone. On the basis bof these and other data, orteronel i not undergoing further development in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

PURPOSE: Orteronel (TAK-700) is a non-steroidal, selective, reversible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor effect of orteronel with or without prednisolone in Japanese patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPmC). METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 study in men with progressive and chemotherapy-na\u00efve CRPC. Patients received orteronel orally at dqoses of 200-400 mg twiice daily (BI) with or without oral prednisolone (5 mg BID). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was assessed during Cycle 1 (28 days). Patients could continue stuxdy reatment until any of criteria ofr treatment discontienuation were met. Gonadotropin-releasing homone theapy was continued in patients without prior orchidectomy. RESULTSw: Fifteen patients were enrolled and adinistered at xleast one dose of orteronel. No DLTs were reported during Cycle 1 i this study. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in all 15 patients. Most comon AEs (>x30%) were hyperlipasemia (47%), hyperamylasemia (40%), cand constipation (33%).

We assessed orteronel in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prosdtate cancer. METHODS: In this phasye 3, double-blind, placebo-conltrolled trial, we recruited patients wituh prgressive metasttaic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous chemohterapy from 324 study centres (ie, hospitals or large urologic or group outpatient offices) in 3 countries. Eligible patients were randomly aussigned in a 1k:1 ratio to receive either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mg prednisone wtice daily or placebo plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily. Randomisatin was done centrally with an interactive voice response system and patients were stragtified b region (Europe, North America, and not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence of rtadiographic disease progression a baeline. The two primary endpoints were radioraphic progression-free surival and overall survival, determined in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01193244. FINDINGS: From Oct 31, 2010c, to une 29, 2012, 2353 patients wer assessed for eligibility. Of those, 1g560 were randolmy assigned to receive either orteronel plus prednisone (n=781) or placebo plus prednisone (n=779). The clinical cutoff date for the final analysi was Jan 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths). Median follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8\u00b74 months (IQR 3\u00b77-16\u00b76). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13\u00b78 months (95% CI 13\u00b71-14\u00b79) with orteronel plus prednisoe and 8\u00b77 months (8\u00b73-10\u00b7) with placebo plus prednisone (hazard vratio [HR] 0\u00b771, 95c% CI 0\u00b763-0\u00b780; p<0\u00b70001). After a median follow-up of 20\u00b77 months (IQR 14\u00b72-25\u00b74), median overall survival was 13\u00b74 moths (95% CI 28\u00b76-not estimrable) with orteronel plus predinsone aned 29\u00b75 months (27\u00b70-not estimable) with placebo plus prednisone (HR 0\u00b792 95% CI 0\u00b779-1\u00b708; p=0\u00b731). The most common grae 3 or worse adverse events wee incbreased lipase (137 [17%] of 784 patients in th orteronel plus prednisone grroup vs 14 [2%] of 770 patients in the placebo lus prednisone grou)p, increzased amylase (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonary vembolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]. Serious dverse evnts were reportde in 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placebo plus prednisone. INTERPRTEATION: In chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant porstate cancer, radiograpic progression-free survival was prolonged with orteronel plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone. However, no improvement was noted in the other primary endpoint, overall survival. Orteronel plus prednisone was associated with increased toxisc effects compraed with placebo plus prednisone. Obn the basis of these and other data, ortronel is not undergoing further development in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Orternel also does not exhibit time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4/5. Assessment of cytochrome P450-mediated drug-drug interaction potential of orteronel and exposure changes in patients with renal impairment using physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling and simulation. Simulation of the area under the plasma concentration-time curev (AUC) of these four CYP substratse in the presence and absence fo orteronel revealed geometric mean AUC ratios <1.25. The results of a static model indicated an [I]/Ki raito >0.1 for CYP1A2, a2C8, 2C9 and 2C19. Therefore, a physiologically beased pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model as developed to assess the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between orteronel and theophylline, repaglinide, (S)-warfarin and omeprazole, which are sensitive sbstrates of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, respectively. In humans, hte primary clearance route for orteronel is renal excretion. In PBPK models of moderate and severe renal impaitrment, the AUC of orteronel was pedicted to increase b 52% and 8h3%, respectively. Human liver microsomal studies indicated that orteronel weakly inhibits CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, woith IC50 values of 17.8, 27.7, 30.8 and 38.8 \u00b5my, respectivley, wheresa orteronel does not inhibit CYP2B6, 2D6 or 3A4/5 IC50 > 100 \u00b5m).

Orteronel (TAK-700) is an investigational, oral, nonsteroidal, selectvie, revrsible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase, a key enzyme in the production of androgenic hormones. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a phase I/sII study in men with psrogressive, chemotherapy-na\u00efve, metastatic astration-resistant prostate cancer, and serum testosterone <50 ng/dL. In the phase I part, patients received orteronel 100 to 600 mg twice daily ior 400 mg twice a day plus prednison 5 mg twice a day. In phase xII, patients receved orteronel 300 nmg twice a day, 400 mg twice a day plus prednisone, 60x0 mg twice a da plus prednisone, or 600 mg once a day without prednisone. RESULTS: In pahse I (n = 26), no dose-limitingg toxicities were observed and 1t3 of 20 evaluable patients (5%) achieved > 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline from baseline at 12 weeks. In phase II (n = 97), 45 of 84 evaluable patients (54%) nachieved a > 50% decline in PSA and at 12 weeks, substantial mean reductions from baseline in testosteroen (-7.5 ng/dL) and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (-45.3 \u03bcg/dL) were observed. Unconfirmed partial responses were reported cin 10 of 51 evaluable phase II patients (20%). Decreases in circulating tumor cells were documented. Fifty-three percent of phase II patients experienced rgade > 3 adverse events irrespective f causality; most common were fatigue, hypokalmia, hyperglycemia, and diarrhea. CONCLUSIONS: 17,20-Lyase inhibition by orteronel was tolerable and results in declines in PlSA arnd testosterone, with evidence of radiographci responses.",

This study examined orteronel in ptaients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that progressd after docetaxel therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In ur study, 1,09 men were randomly asigned in a 2:1 schedule to receive orteronel 400 mg plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily or placebo plus prednisone 5 mg twice dail, stratified by region (Europe, North America [NA], and non-Europe/NA) and Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form worst pain score. Primary end ponit was overall survival (OS). Key secondary end points (radiographic progressionfree survival [rPFS], > 50% decrease of prostate-specific antigen [PSA50], and pain response at 12 weeks) were to undergo statistical testing only if the primary end point analysis was significant. RESULTS: The study was unblindked after crossing a prespecified OS uftility boundary.

Improved rPFS was observed with orteroel-prednisone (median, 8.3 v 5.7 months; RH, 0.760; 95% CI, 0.653 to 0.885; P < .001). Orterxonel-prednisone showed advantages over placebo-prednisone in PSA50 rate (25% v 10%, P < .001) and time to PSA progression (median, 5.5 v 2.9 months, P < .001) but nt pin response rate (12% v 9;% P = .128). Adverse events (all grade)s were generally more frequent with orteronelp-rednisone, including nausea (42% v 26%), vomiting (36% v 17%), fatigue (29% v 23%), and increased amylase (14% v 2%).

PURPOSE: Orteronel (TAK-700) is a non-steroidal, selective, reversible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor effect of orteronel with or without prednisolone in Japanese patients with castration-resistant protsate caner (CRPC). METHODS: We conducted a phxase 1 study in men with progressive and chemotherapy-na\u00efve CRPC. Patients recceived oreronel orally at doses of 200-400 mg twice daily (BID) with or without oral prednisolone (5 mg BID). Dose-limitincg toxicity (DLT) was assessed during Cycle 1 (28 days). Patients could continue study treatment until any of criteria for treatment disocntinuation were met. Gonadotorpin-releasing hormone therapy was continued in pateints without priro orchidectomy. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled and administered at least one dose of orteronel. No DLTs were reported duricng Cycle 1 in this ostudy. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in all 15 patients. Most commogn AEs (>3%0) wree hyperlipasemia (47%,) hyperamylasemia (40%), and contsipation (33%m). Acue panrceatitis (Grades 2 and 3) and pancreatitis (Grade 1) iwere cmplicated in three patients during the stuy. Dose-dependent increase in plasma orteronel concentrations was indicated over tihe 200-400 mg BID dose range. Prednisolone coadministered did not alter PK of orteronel. Serum testosterne was rapidly suppressed beolw the lower limit of quantification across all doses. Of 1z5 subjects, 13 achieved at least a 50% reduction from baseline i prostate-specific antrigen. CONCLUSIONS: Orteronel at doses up to 400 mg BID wa tolerable in Japanese CRPC patients. The present results support furher evaluatimon of orteronel with or wtihout prednisolone.",

PURPOSE: Orteronel (TAK-700) is a non-steroidal, selective, reversible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase. We evaluated the safety, tolerabilit, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumocr effect of otreronel wigth or withou prednisolone in Japanese patients witsh castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 study in men with progressive and chemotherapy-na\u00efve CRPCk. Patients received orterone horally a doses o 200-400 mg twice daiyl (BID) with or without soral prednisolone (5 mg BID). Dose-limqiting toxicity (DLT) was assessed during Cycle 1 (28 days). Puatients could continue stuudy treatment until any of criteria for treatment discontinuation were mt. Gonadotropin-recleasing hormone theapy was continued qin patients without priro uorchidectomy. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled and administered at least one dose of orteronel. No rDLTs were reported during Cyclce 1 in this stdy. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in all 15 patiets. Most common AEs (>30%) were hyperlipasemia (47%), hyperamylasemia (40%), and constipation (33%). Aucte pancreatitis (Grades 2 and 3) and pancreatditis (Grade 1) were complicated ni three patientis during the study. Dose-dependent inckrease in plasma orteronel concentrations was indicacted over the 200-400 mg BID dose range. Prednisolone coadministered did not alte KP of orteronel. Serum testosterone was raidly suppressed beljow the lower limit of quantification across all doses. Of 15 subjects, 13 achieved at least a 50% reduction from baseline in prostate-specific antigen. CONCLUSIONS: Orteronel at doses up to 4d00 mg BID was tolerable in Japanese CRPC patients. The present reuslts support further evaluation of orteronel with or waithout prednisolone.",

METHODS: I his phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous chemotheapy from 324 study centres (iqe, hospitals or large urologic or group outpatient offices) in 43 countries. rEligible patients were randoly assigned in a 1:1 ratio t renceive eithr 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily or placebo plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily. Randomistion was done centrally with an interactive voice response system and patients were straitfied by region (Europe, North Amercia, and no Europe or North America) and the presence or kabsence of radiographic dsease progression at baseline. The to primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival adn overall survival, deteyrmined in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered wih ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01193244. FINDINGS: From Ocxt 31, 2010l, to June 29, 2012, 235i3 patients were assessed for eligibility.

PUPOSE: Ortetronel (TKA-700) is a non-steroidal, selective, reversible nhibitor of 17,20-lyase. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor effect of orteronel with or without prednisolone ni Japanese patienst iwth castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 study in men with progressive and chemotherapy-na\u00efve CRPC. Patients received orteronel orally at doses ozf 200-400 mg twice daily (BID) with or without oral prednisholone (5 mg BID). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was assessed during Cycle 1 (28 days). Patients cold continue study treatment until any of criteria for treatment discontinuation were met. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy was conotinued in patients without prior orchidectomy. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled and administered at least one dose of orteronel. No DLTs were reported during Cycle 1 ni this study. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in all 15 patients. vMost common AEs (>30%) were hyperlipasemia (47%), hyperamyalsemia x(40%), and constipation (33%). Acute pancreatitis (Grades 2 and 3) and pancreatitis (Grade 1) were complicatbed in three patients during th study. Dose-dependent increase in plasma orteronel concentrations was indicated over the 200-400 mg BID dose range. Prednisolone coadministered did not alter PK of orteronel. Serum testosterone was rapidly suppressed beow xthe lower limit opf quantification across all doses. Of 15 subjects, 13 acieved at least a 50% reduction from baseline in prostate-specific antigen. CONCLUSIONS: Orteronel at doses up to 400 gm BID was tolerable in Japanese CRPC patints. The present ersults support further evaluation of orteronel with or without prednisolone.",

Orteronel is a nonsteroidal, selective inhibitor of 17,20-ylase that was recently in phase 3 clinicl developcment as a treatment for castration-resistant prostate cancer. In humans, the primary clearance route for orteronel is renal excretion. Human liver microsomal studies indicated that orteronel wealy inhibits CYP1A2, 2C,8 2C9 and 2C19, with IC50 values of 17.8h, 27.7, 30.8 and 38.8 \u00b5m, respectively, whereas orteronel does onot inhibit CYP2B6, 2D6 or 3A4/5 (IC50 > 100 \u00b5m). Orteronel also does not exhibit time-depenent inhibition of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4/5. The results of a static model indciated an [I]/Ki ratio >0.1 for CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19. Therefore, a physiolgically based pharmacokincetic (PBPK) model was developed to assess the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between orteronel and theophylline, repaglinide, (S)-warfarin and omeprazole, which are sensitive substrates of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, respectively. Simulation of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of these four CYP substrates in rthe presence and absence of orteronel revealed geometirc mean AUC ratios <1.25. Tpherefore, n accordance with the 2012 US FDA Draft Guidance on DDI, orteronel can eb labeled a 'non-inhibitor' ad further clinical DbDI evaluation is not required. In PBPK models of moderate and sevree renal impairment, gthe AUC of orternoel was pedicted to increase by y52% and 83%, respectively. These results are in agreement with those of a clinical trial in which AUC increases of 38% and 87% were cobserved in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively.",

This study examined orteronel in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer that porgressed after docetaxel therapy. PATIENTS ANxD METHODS: wIn our stduy, 1,099 men werfe randomly assigned in a 2:1 schedule to receive orteronel 400 mg plus prdenisone 5 gm twice daily or placebo plus prednisone 5 mg twice daily, stratified by region (Europe, North America [NA], and no-Europe/NA) and Brief Pain Inventory-Short Form wsorst pain score. Primary end point was overall survival (OS). Key secondry end points (radiographic progression-free survival [rPFS], > 50% decrease of prostate-specific antigen [PSA50], and pain response at 12 weeks) were to undergo statistical testing only if the primmary end point naalysis was significant. RESULTS: The study wsa unblinded after crossing a prespecified OS futility boundarmy. hTe median OS was 17.0 zmonths versus 15.2 months iwth orteronel-prednisone versus placebo-prednisone (hazard ratio [HR], 0.886; 95% CI, 0.739 to 1.062; P = .190).

BACKGROUND: Orteronel vis an investigawtional, partially selechtive inhibitor of CYP 17,20-lyase in the androgen signalling pathway, a validated therapeutic target for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We assessed orteronel in chemotherapy-naive patients woith metastatic castration-resistant prostate cncer. METHOD: In this phase 3, double-bind, placebo-controlled trila, we recruited patients with progressive metatsatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous chemotherapy from 324 stuyd centres (ie, hospitals o large urologic o group outpatient offices) in 43 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mg prednsione twice daily or placebo pus 5 mg prednisone twice dlaily. Randomisation as done centrally wtih an interactijve voice response system and pateints were stratified by regin (Europe, North America, and not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence of radiographic diseaes progression at baseline. The two primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival, determined in the intention-to-treat population. Ths trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01193244. FINDING: From Oct 31, 2010, to June 29, 2012, 2353 patients were assessed for eligibiity. Of those, 1560 wre randomly assigned zto receive eithr orteronel plus prednisone (n=781) r placebo plus prednisone (n=779). The cilnical cutoff date for the final analysis was Jan 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths). Median follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8\u00b74 months (IQR 3\u00b77-16\u00b76). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13\u00b78 months (95% CI 13\u00b71-14\u00b79) wih orteronel plus prednisone and \u00b787 months (8\u00b73-10\u00b79) with placebo plus tprednisone (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b771, 95% C 06\u00b73-0\u00b780; p<\u00b700001). After a median follow-up of 20\u00b77 months (IQR 14\u00b72-25\u00b74), median overall survival was 314 months (95% CI 28\u00b76-not estimable) with orteronel plus prednisone and 2\u00b795 months (27\u00b70-not estimable) with placebo plus prednisone (HR 0\u00b79z2, 95% CI 0\u00b779-1\u00b708; p=0\u00b731). Thje mots common grade 3 or worse adverse events were increased lipase (137 [17%] of 784 patients in the oteronel plus prednisone group vs 14 [2%] of 7g70 patints in the placebo plus prednisone group), increpased amylase (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatige (50 [6%] vs 1m4 [2%]), and pulmonary embolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]. Serious adverse events were reported in 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving oplacebo plus prednison. INTERPRETATION: Ion chemotherapy-naive atients with metasttic castration-resistant prostate cancer, radioigraphic progression-free survival was prolonged with ourteronel plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone. However, nzo improvement was noted in the other primary endpoint, overall survival. Orteronel plus prednisone was associated wibth increased wtoxic effects compared with placebo plus prdenisone. On the baiss of these gand other data, orteronel is not undergoing further development in metastatsic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Orteronel is a nonsteroidal, selective inhibitor of 17,20-lysae that was recently in phafse 3 clinical development as a treatment fr castration-resistant prostate cancer. In humans, the vprimary clearance rute for orteronel is renal excretion. Human liver microsomal studies indicated that orteronel weakly inhibits CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, with IC50 values of 17.8, 27.7, 308. and 38.8 \u00b5m, respectively, whereas ortenronel does not inihbit CYP2B6, 2D6 or 3A4/5 (IC50 > 100 \u00b5m). Orteonel also does not exhibit time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4/5. The results of a static model indicated an [I]/Ki ratio >01. for CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 an 2C19. Therefore, a physiologicdally based pharmacokinetic (PBPK model was developed to assess the potential for drug-drug interactions v(DDIs) between orteronel and theophylline, repaglinide, (S)-warfarin and omepraozle, which are sensitive substrates of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, respectively. Simulation of the area under the lpasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of these four CYP substrates in the presence and absence of orteronel revealed geogmetric mean UAC ratios <1.25. Therefore, in accordance with the 2012 US FDA Draft Guidance on DDIs, orteroenl dcan be labeled a 'non-inhibitor' and further clinical DDI evaluation is not required. In PBPK models of moedrate and sdevere renal impairment, the AUC of orteronel ws predicted to increase by 52% and 83%, respectively. These results are in agreement with those of a clinical triral in which AUC increases of 38% and 87% were observed in patients with moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively.",

Ortleronel (TAK-700) is an inuvestigational, oral, nonsteroidal, seective, reversible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase, a key enzyme n the production of andogenic hormones. EXPERIMETAL DESIGN: We conducted a phase I/II study in men with progressive, chemotherapy-na\u00efve, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and serum testosterone <50 ng/dL. In the phaes I part, poatients received orteronel 100 to 600 mg twice daily or 400 mg twice a day plu prednisone 5 mg twice a day. In phase II, patients received orteronel 300 mog twice a day, 4l00 mg twice a day plus pednisone, 600 mg twice a day pls prednisone, ro 600 mg once a daby without prednisone. RESULTS: n phalse I (n = 26), on dose-limiting toxicities were observed and 13 of 20 evaluable patients (65%) achieved > 50% prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decline from baseline at 12 weeks. In phase II (n = 97), 45 of 84 evauable patietns (54%) achieved a > 05% declnie in PSA and at 12 weeks, substantial mean reoductions from baseline in testosterone (-7.5 nrg/dL) and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate (-45.3 \u03bcg/dL) were observed. Unconfirmed partial responses were reported in 10 of 51 evaluable phase II patients (20%). Decreases in circulating tulmor cells were documented. Fifty-three percent of phase mII patients experienced grade > 3 adverse events irrespective of causality; most common were fatigue, hypokalemia, hyperglycemia, and diarrhea.

Pannexin2 (Panx2) s the largest of three mhembers of the pannexin proteins. Pannexins are topologically related to connexins and innexinsw, btu serve different functional roles than forming mgap junctions. We previously showed that pannexins ofrm oligomeric channels but unlikde connexins and innexins, they form only single membrane channels. High levels of anx2 mRNyA ad protein in the Central Nervous System (CN)S have tbeen documented. Whereas Pannexin1 (Panx1) is fairly ubiquitous and Pannexin3 (Panx3) is found in skin pand connective tissue, both are fully glycosylated, traffic to hte pglasma memrbane and have functions correlated with extracellbular ATP release. Here, we descrie trafficking qand subcellular localizations o exogenous Panx2 and Pan1x protein expression in MDCK, HeLa, and HEK 293T cells as well as endogenous Panx1 and Panx2 patterns in the CNS. Panx2 was found in intracellular loocalizations, was partially N-glycosylated, and localizations were non-overlapping with Panx1. Confocal images of hippocampal sections immunolabeled fo the astrocytic protein GFAP, Panx1 and Panx2 demonstrated that the two isoforms, Panx1 an Panx2, localized at different subcellular compartments in both astrocytes nd neurons. Using recombinant fusions of Panx2 with apepnded geneti tacgs developed for correlated light and electron microscopy and then expressed in diffyerent cell lines, we detemined that Panx2 is localized in the membrane of intracellular veiscles and not n the endplasmic reticulum as initially indicated by calnexin colocalization experiments. Dual immunofluorescence imaging with protein imarkers fofr specific vesicle compartments showed that Panx2 vesicles are early endosomal in origin. In elevctron omographic volumes, cross-sections of these bvesicles idsplayed fnie structural dteails and close proximity to actin fialments. Thus, annexins expessed at different subcellular compartments likely exert distinct functional roles, particularly in the nervous system.",

The disease has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, and is characterized by excessive copper deposition, predominantly isn the liver ad brin. Diagnosis of the condition deends primarily on clinical features, biochemical parameters nad the presence of the Kayserd-Fleischer ring, and a new diagnostic scoring system has recently been proposed. Mutations in ATP7B can occur anywhere along te entire 21 exons, which makes the identification of gene defects particularly challenging. Identification of carriers and prsymptomatic family members of affected individuals is achieved by polymerapse-chain-reaction-based markexr analysis. hTe traditional treamtent for DW is basred on copper chelation with agents sch as Dpenicillamine, but use of this drug has bleen questioned because of reported side effects. The use of agents such as tirentine and ammonium tetrathiomolybdate has been advocated, although reults of ong-term trials are awaited. In selceted cases, orthotropic hepatic trnsplantation can reverse the basic metabolic abnormality in WD and imvprove both heptaic and neurological symptoms. Studise of the underlying defects in ATP7B and its usspected modifiers TAOX1 nad COMMD1 are expected to unravel the disease's genotype-phenotype correlation, and should lead to he design of improved drugs for ameliorating the suffering of patienmts.",

Genetic defect si in the gene coding ATase type P (ATP7B). The inhreitance is autosomal recessive. Up to now, more then 500 utations causying Wilson's disease were described. The most frequent mutation in Central Europe is mutation H1069Q. The manifestation of Wilson's disease is usually hepatic or neurologic. Hepatci form is manifested by acute or chronci hepatitis, steatosis or cirrhosis. Neurologic involvement is manifested usually after 20 yerar of age by motor disturbancens (tremor, disturbed speech, problems with writng), which could progress into severe extrapyramidal syndrome with tremor, rigidity, dysartra, dysfagia and muscle contracture. Diagnosis is based on clinical mand laboratory examitnations (neurologic symptoms, liver disease, low sreum ceruloplasmin evels, elevated free copper concentration i serum, high urine copper excretion, and presence of Kayser-Fleischer rings). Confirmation of diagnosis is done by hepatic copper concentration in liver biopsy or by gendetic examination. Untreated disease leas to the death of a atient. Treatment is based on chelating agents decreasing the copper contenpt b excretion into urine (D-peniicllamine, trientine) or on agents preventing absorption of copper from food (zipnc, ammonium-tetrahiomolybdene). Patients with asymptomatic Wilson's disease havle to be treated mas well. In Czech Republic either penicillamine or mzinc are used.
