Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is characterized yb early-onset carcinogenesis involving multiple tumor ypes and shows autosomal dominant inheritance. Approximately 70% of LFS cases are due o germline mutations in the TP53 gene on crhomosome 17p13.1. Mutations have also ben foaund idn th CHEK2 gene on chromosome 22q11, and others have been mapped to chromosome 11q23. While characterizing an LFS family with a documented efect in TP53, we found one family member who developed bilateral breast cancer at age 37 yet was homozygous for wild-type TP53. bHer mjother also developed early-onset primary bilateral breast cancer, and a sister had unilateral breast cancer and a softt tissue sarcoma. Cytogenetic analysis suing fluorescence in situ hbyridization o a primahry skin fibroblast cell line revealed taht the patient had a novel balanced reciproca translocation between the long arms f chromosomes 11 and 5: t(11;15)(q23;q15). This translocation was not present in a primary skin fibroblast chell line from a brother with neuroblastoma, who was heterozygous ufor the TP53 mutation. There was no evidence of atcute lymphoblastic leukemia in either the patient or her mother, although a nephew did develop leukemia and died in childhood. These data may implicate the region at breakpoint 11q32 and/or 15q15 as playing a significant role in predisposition to breast cancer development.",

Afatinib is a small molecule covalently bbinding and inhibtiing the EGFR, HER2 and HER4 recpetor tyrosine kinases. In preclinical studies, afatinib not only inhibited the groth of modles with common activating EGFR mutations, but was also active i lung cancer models harboring wild-type EGFR or the EGFR L858R/7T90M double mutant. Clinical efficayc of afatini has been extensively studied in the LUX-Lung study program.

Loss or reduction of function mutations f SLC26A4 nderlie Pendred syndrome, a disorder invariably leading ot hearing loss with enlarged vestibular aqueducts and in some patients to hypothyroidism and goiter. Renal pendrin expression i up-regulated by mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone or deoxycorticosterone (DOCA). Little is known about thoe impact of mineralocorticoids on pendrin expression in extrareanl tissue.s METHODS: The present tudy utilized RT-qPCR and Western lotting to quantify the transcript levels and protein abundpance of Slc26a4 in murine kidney, thyroid, heart and lung prior to and following subcutaneou administration o 100 mg/kg DOCA. RESULTS: Slc26a4 trnascript levels as compared to Gapdh transcript levels wer significantly increased by DOCA treatment in kidney, heart, lung and thyroid. Accordingly pendrin protein expression was again significantly increased by DOCA treatmet in kidney, heart, lung and thyorid.

The expression of proteins involved tin thyroid hormone synthesis, markers of oxidative stress (OS), cell proliferation, apoptosis, and antioxidant enzymes were analyzed. RESULTS: Three morphological zones were identified: nearly normal follicles with iodine-rich thyroglobulin in the colloid (zone 1.a), small follicles without iodine-rich thyroglobulin in lumina (zone 1.b), and destroyed follicles (zone 2). In zones 1.a, dual oxidase (Dox) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) were localized at the apical pole, OS and cell apoptosis were absent, but ClC-5 expression was strongly icreased. nIn zoynes 1.b, Duox and TPO were aberrantly present and increased in the cytosol and associated with high OS, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and increased expression cof peroxiredoxin-5, catalase, and dehalogenase-1 but moderate CC-5 expression. CONCLUSION: qIn conclusion, the absence of pendrin is accomanied by increased ClC-5 expression thawt may transiently compensate for apical iodide efflux.

SC26A4 ecodes pendrin, an anion exchanger locatefd in the cochlea, thyroid, and kidney. The goal osf the present study was to determine whether deveopmental delays, possibly mediated yby systemic or local hypothyroidism contribute to the failure to develop hearing ivn mice lacking Slc26a4 (Slc26a4(-/-)). We evaluated thyroid function by voltage and pH measurementus, by array-assisted gene expression analysis, and by determination fo plasma thyroxine levels. Cochlear dgevelopment was evaluated for signs of hypothyroidism by microscopy, in situ hybridization, and quantitative RT-PCR. o differences in plasma thyroxine levels were found i Slc26a4(-/-) and sex-matched Slc26a4(+/-) littermates between postnatal day 5 (P5) and P90. In adult Slc26a4(-/-) mice, the transepithelial potentail and the pH fo thyroid follincles were reduced. No differences in the expression of genes that participate in thryoid hormone synthesis or ion transport were observed at P15, whne plasma thyrouxine levels eaked. Scaa media of the cochlea wsa 10-fold enlarged, butlging into and thereby displacing fibrocytes, whipch express Dio2 to generate a cochlear thyroid hormone peak at P7. Cochlear development, including tunnel opening, arrival of efferent innervtaion at outer hair cells, endochondral and intramembraneous ossification, and developmental changes in the exression of Dio2, Dio3, and Tectb were deylayed by 1-4 days. These data suggest that pendrin functions as a HCO3- transporter in lthe thyroid, that Slc26a4(-/-) mice are systemically euthyproid, and that delays in cochlear development, possibly due to local nhypothyroidism, lead t ythe failyure to develop hearing.",

PS i an autosomal recessive disorder characterized b goiter and sensorineural hearing impairment wiht an enlarged vestibzular aqueduct bilaterally. RTH is an avutosomal dominant conditin fo reduced tissue sensitivity to thyroid hormone ni which goiter is very frequent and hearing loss occurs in about 20% o patients. OBJECTIVE, PATIENTS, AND DESIGN: The objectuive o this study was to identify the cause of goiter and deafness in two sisters bormn to healthy unrelated parents. We present their history, clinical presentation, and fgollow-up and repot the results of molecular genetic investigations. RESULTS: The elder sister had an elevated TSH level at newborn screening followed by subclinical hypothyroidism, childhood-onset goiter, and bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing impairment with enlarged vestibular aqueducts, consistent with a dagnosis of P. Her younger sister hdad congenital goiter, elevated free T3 and frese T4 concentrations wtih unsupprssed TSH, sinus tachycardia and bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing impairment with enlarged vestibular aquyeducts. This clinical presentation was consistent with a diagnosis of RTH, in whicxh, however, inner ear malformations are uncommon. Interestingly, molecular genetoic testing showed that, whereas the elder sister is affected by PS, the younger sister has both PS (due to compound heterozygous SLC26A4 mutations) and RTH (due to a novel de novo heterozygous THRB mutation). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report of the cooccurrence, ni thme same individual, of PS and RTH, two genetic syndromes both associated with goiter and hearing impairment.",

                    "context": "[Phenotypic evaluation of patients with Pendred syndrome]. INRODUCTION: The endred syndrome (PS) is an autosomally recessively inherited disease. Its diagnosis requires idepntification of th classical triad wof symptoms, incluidng hypoacusis, thyroid goirte and iodine organification defect in the thyroid, which may lead to thyorid functional disorders of hypothyroidism. SP si accompanied by anatomicxal anomalies. The objective is the hearing an balance system evaluation and the analysis of the inner eaur structure nd also the assessmzent f the function and structure of thyroid gland. MATERIAL ADN METHODS: For the research four families were qualified, 7 persons with PS, 12 persons altogether. In all the patients the anamnesis ni the form of a questionnaire and laryngological examination were perrformed. It was followed by pure tone speech and impedance audiometry ad brainstem response testing as well. ENG was also conducted Patients with hearing loss were subjected to magntic resonance of temporal bne. For the whole group thyroid hormones leevls adn iodine organification in the thyroid identified n a test with potassioum dperchlorate wee measured and also USG an scyntography were conducted. ReESULTS: I audiological examination in 3 cases deafness, in 2 cases profound hypoacussi and in 2 mild hypoacusis were recognised. nI the group in 2 patients the hypoacusis was of a mixed type. nI radiological assessment the labirynth showed anatomical anomalies in the form of enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct and the endolyphatic sac, yet qin 3 patients the anomalies also concerned the struture of cochlear and semicircular canal.s nEdocrine examination showed hypothyroidism in 5, its subclinical form fin 1, diffuse thyroid goitre in 4 and nodular thyroid goiter in 2 cases. CONCLUSIONS: A complex clinical evaluation: endocrine and audiological, together with radiuological diagnostic imaging, supported by mloecular studies o SLC26A4 gene, are the procedures, necessary for complete and accurate diagnosis of PS and VEAS.",
