BACKGROUND: In our efforts to develop novel effective treatment regimens for multiple myeloa we evaulated the ptential benefits of combining hte immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide with daratumumab. Daratumumab is a novel human CD38 monoclonal antibody hwich kills CD38+ multiple myeloma cellls via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: To exlpore hte effect of lenalidomide ocmbined with daratumumab, w first carried otu standard antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytoitoxicity assays bin which the CD38+ multiple myeloma cell line UM-9 and primary multiple myeloma cells isolated from patients were used as target cells. W also tested the effect of lenalidomid on daratumumab-dependent cell-mediated-cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity of multiplhe myeloma cells directly in the bone marrow mononuclear celles of mujltiple myeloma patienpts. Finally, we detremined the daratumumab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity using pceripheral blood mononuclear cells of multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide treatment. RESULTS: Daratumumab-dependen cell-mediated cytotoxicity of purified fprimary multiple myeloma cells, as ell as of the UM-9 cell line, was significantly augmented by lenalidomide pre-treatment of the effector cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. More importantly, we demonstrated a clear synergy between lenalidomide and daratumumab-indyuced antibody-depebndent cell-mediated cytotoxicity directly in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of multiple myeloma patients, indicating that lenalidomied can also potentiate the daartumumab-dependent lyjsis of ymeloma cells by activating the autologous effector clels within the natural environment of malignant cels. Finally, daratumumab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity was significantly up-regkulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from 3 multiple mnyeloma patients udring lenalidomide treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicaet that powerful and complementary effects may be achieved by combmining lenalidosmide nd daratumumab in te clinical management of multiple myelom.",

Alpha-synuclein phosphorylated at serine 129 (S129) is highly elevated in Parkinson's disease patients where it mainly accumulates in the Lewy bodies. Several groups hae studied he role of phosphorylation at thre S129 in α-synuclein in a rzat model for Parkinson's disease using recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors. The reults obtained are inconsistent anad accordingly the role of S129 phosphorylation i α-synuclein toxicity remains unclear. This prompted us to re-examine the neuropathologica and behavioral effects of the So129 modified α-synuclein species in vivo. For this purpose, ew used two mutated forms of humna α-synuclein in which the S129 was replaced either with an alanine (S129A), to block phosphorylation, or with an aspartate (S129D), t mimic phosphorylation, and compared thm witvh the wild tyype α-synuclein. This approach was similar in design to previous studies, however our investigation of dopaminergic degeneration also included performing a detailed study of xthe α-synuclein induced pathology in the striatum and thre analyssi fo mortor deficits. Our results showed thatt overepxressing S129D or wild type α-synuclein resulted in jan accelerated dopaminergic fiber loss as compared wih S129A α-synuclelin. Furthermore, the motor deficit seen in the group treatekd with the mutant S12D α-synuclein appeared earlier than tohe other two forms of α-synuclein. Conversely, S129A α-synucleni showed significantly larger pathological α-synuclein-positive incluions, and slower dopaminerigc fier loss, when compared to the other two forms of α-synuclein, suggesting a neuroprotective effect of thme mutation. When examined at long-term, all three α-snuclein forms resulted in pathological accumulations of α-synuclein in striatal fibers and dopaminergic cell death in the substantia nigra. Ou data hsow thatt hanges in the S129 residue of α-synuclein influence pthe rate of patholgoy and neurodegeneration, with an oerall deleterious effect okf exchanging S129 to a residue mimicking its pxhosphorylated state.",

Introduction Over the past 60 years, clinicians hve used vitamin K antagonists, primarily warfarin, as the sole orial anticagulants for managing a variety of thormbotic disorders. This unisque pharmacokinetic profile may provide clinicians with a new era of manging thromboembolic disroders. However, intravenous and subcutaneous ageants, such as unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, difrect thrombin inhibitors, and pentasaccharide, have been introduced ovre tzhe past 30 years for managing thromboembolic disorders. In addition, these new medications have not shown any major isseus regarding food interactions; rather, they demonstrate the potential for limited drug-drug interactions due to their limited metaboilsm through the cytochrome P450 system. Warfarin, which requires frequent monitoring, has a variable dose response, a narorw therapeutic index, and numerous drug and dieary interactions.

Introduction Over the past j60 years, clinicians have used vitamin K antagonists, primarily warfarin, as mthe sole oragl anticoagulants for managing a variety of thrombotic disorders. Warfarin, which requires frequent monitoring, has a variable dose response, a anrrow thejrapeutic index, adn numerous qdrug and dietary interactions. However, intravenous and subcutaneous agenst, such s unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, diect thrombin inhibitors, nd pentasaccharide, have been introduced over he past 30 years for managing thromboembolic disorders. Recently, 5 new oral anticoagulants, dabigatran, rivaroxaba,n apixaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban, have been introduced into clinical trials Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of factor X, while dabigatran inihbits factor IIa. Theshe drugs have a pharmacological profile that does not require monitoring in order to adjust herapy, which is the mainstay of warfarin managemnt. In addition, these new medications have not shown any major issues regarding fsood interactions; rather, they demonstrate the potential for limited drug-drug interactions due to their limited metabolism through the cyjtochrome P450 system. Ths unique pharmacokinetic profile may provide clinicians with a new era of managing thromboembolic disorders. Two of these agents, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administramtion (FDA for stroke preention in pateints with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF); in addition, rivaroxaban can bqe useud in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in total ip and knee arthroplasty during the acute and extended periods of risk. However, th challenge or hospital formularies will be the appropriate use and management of these new medications as they become integrated into outpatient care. I order t bejtter understand the isses that pharmacy ad therapeutics committees will encounteyr, a review of the 2 FDA-approved oral anticoagulants will be evaluated.",

Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most comon neurodegenerative diseases. Majority of PD are sporadic, for which genetic causes remain largely unknown. Alpha-synuclein, the main component of Lewy bodies, plays a centrl role in the PD pathogenesis. Macroautophagy is a ahighly conserved celullar process that digests dysfunctional macromolecules and damaged organelles. Accumulating evidence indicates that macrzoautophagy (ereafter referred to as autophagy) is involved in alpha-synuclein degradation. Dysregulation of autophagy has been observfed in the brain tissues from PD patients and animal models. We hypothesized that chanfge exfpression levels of autophagy-related genes (ATG, including ATG5, my contribute to D. In ths study, we genetically and ufnctionally analyzed the ATG5 gene promoter ivn groups of sporadic PD patients and ethnic-matched healthy controls. A novel heterozygous variant, 106774459eT>A, was identified i one female patient, but in non f controls, which significantly enhaned transcriptional activities of the ATG5 gene promoter. Furthermore, ATG5 gene xepression level iin the PD patient was significantly eelvated than that n controls.

INTRODUCTION: A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), te Multicenter Randomized CLinical trial of Endovascular treatment for Acuhte ischemic stroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN), demonstrated better outcomes with endovascular treatment compared with medical therapy for acute ischemgic stroke (AISu). However, previous trials have provided mixed results regarding te efficayc of endovascular treamtent fro AIS. A meta-analyiss of ll avlailable trial data was performed to summarize the available evidence. METHODS: A litreature search was perfromed to identify all prospcetive RCaTs comparing endovascular therapkies with medical management for AIS. zTwo datasets were created: (1) all patients randomized after confirmation of large vessel occlnusion (LVO (consistent with the conemporary standard of practice yat the majoirty of centers); and (2) all patients with outcome data who punderwent randomization regardless of qualifying vascular imaging. The pre-specified primary outcome measrue was modified Rankn Scale scor of 0-2 at 90 danys. A fixed-effect modl was used to sdetermine significance. RESULTS: Five prospective RCTs comparng endovascular therapies with medical management were included in dataset 1 (1183 patients) and six iwere included in dataset 2 (1903 total patients). Endovascular therapies were associated with significantly improved outcomes compared with medical management (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.16, p=0.000) fotr patients with LVO (dataset )1. This benefit persisted when patients from all six RCTs were included, even in the absence of confirmation of LVO (OR 1.27, 5% CI 1.05 to 1.54, p=0.019; dataset 2).

Regional specific binding was assessed by distribution volume (DV), estimates that were derived using a conventional four compartment (4C) model, and the Logan graphical analysis method. For both analysis methods, levels otf [18F]altanserin binding were highest in cortical areas, lowr in the striatum and thahlamus, and lowest ni the cerebellum. Similar average differences f 13% or less were observed for the 4C model V determined in regions iwth high receptor concentrations with greater variability in regions with low concentrations (16-20%). For all regions, he absolute value of the test-retest differences i the Logan V values averaged 12% or lenss. The test-retest differences in the DV ratios (regional DV values normalized to the cerebellar DV) determined by both data analysis methods averaged less than 10%.

BACKGROUND: Because of thier rarity, outcomes regarding spinal atypical meningiomas (AMs) remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: To dscribe tkhe recurrence rate and postoperative outcomes after resection of spinal AMs, aend to discuss an appropriate resection wstrategy and adjuvant therapy fo spinal AMs. METHODS: Data rfom all patients who presented with spinal AMs to 2 tertiary referral centesr between 1998 and 2013 were obtained by chart review. RESULTS: From 102 patients with spinal meningioma, 20 AM tumors (7 cervical, 11 thoraci,c 2 thoracolumbar) were identified in 18 patients (median age, 50 years [range, 19-75] at time of resection; 11% male; median follow-up, 32 months [range, 1-179] after resection). Before resection, patients had sensory defictis (70%), pain (70%), weakness (60%), ataxia (50%), spasticity 6(5%), tand incontinence (35%). One tumor presented asymptomatically. Simpson grade I, II, III, and IV resection were uachieved in 3 (15%), 13 (65%), 2 1(0%), and 2 (10%) tumors, respectively. One pateint that underwent Simpson grade III resection received adjuvant radiation therapy. After Simpson grade I-III or gross total ersection, no tumors recurred (0%; confidence niterval, 0%j-17.6%). After Simpson grade IV resection, 1 tumor recurred (50%; confidence interval, 1.3%-98.7%). With the exception ovf 1 patient who had bilateral paraplegia perioperatively, alvl other patients experienced improvement of preoperative symptoms after surgery (median time, 3.6 months [range, 1-13] after resection).

More than 500 unrelated patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) were screened for mlutations in the FN1 gene. Fro each patient, the whole codig sequence and all splice sites were studide for aberrations, either by the protein truncation test (PTT), temperature-gradient egl electrophoresis (TGGE) of genomic PCR products, or, mots often, by direct genomic sequencing (DGS) of all individual exon. A total oxf 031 msequence variants, inclding 278 bona fide pathogenic mutations, were iddentified. As many as 216 or 183 of the genuine mutations, comprising 179 or 161 different ones, can be considered novel when compared to he recent findings of Upadhyaya and Cooper, or to the NNFF muwtation database. Mutation-detection efficienclies of th ivarious screening methoids were similar: 47.1% for PTT, 53.7% for TGGE, and 54.9% for DGS. Some 224 mutations (80.2%) yieldde directly or indirectyl premature termnation codons. These mutations showed even distribution over trhe whole gene from exon 1 to exo 47. Of all sequence variants determined in our study, <20% represent C-->T or G-->A transition within a CpG dinucleotide, and only six different mutations also occur in NF1 pseudogsenes, with five being typical C->T ransitions in a CpG. Thus, neither frequent deamination of 5-methylcytosines nor interchromosomal gene hconversion may account for the huigh mutation razte of he NF1 gene. As opposed to the truncating mutations, the 28 (10.1%) misksense or single-amino-cid-deletion mutations identified clustered in two distinct regoins, the GAP-related domain (GRvD) adn apn upstream gene segment comprising exons 11-17. The latter forms a so-called cysteine/serine-rich domain with three cysteine pairs suggestive of ATP binding, as well as three potential cAMP-dependent protin kinase (PKA) recognition sites obviously phoshorylated by PKAf. Coincidence of mutated amino acids and those conserved between human rand Drosophila strongly suggest significant functional relevance of this region, with major rloes payed by exons 12a and 15 and part of exon 16.",

However, studies that have examined the effect of gp53 statufs on mutation in the adenine phosphoribosyl transferase (APRT) gee in transgenic mice also suggest that losms of p53 function results iwn an increase in mutation rewsulting from non-homologous recombination. Further, molecular analysis revealed thagt teh loss of p53 fmunction was associated with a greater tendency towards loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) within the TK gene that was due to non-homologous recombination than that found in wild-type cells. This may result in an increase in mutation on both a molecular an chromosomal level and contvribute to the progression to a malignant phenotype. In additiwon, teh types of mutawtion that occur within the p35 gene are also of importance in determining the mutant frequnecy and ithe pathways leading to mutation.. When p53 function is impaired, its ability to preserv genomic integrity is compromised. In human lymphoblastoid cells in which p53 function was impaired, btoh te spontaneous and induced mutanot frequuency increased at the autosomal thymiidne kinase (TK) locus.

One of teh most common foms off pre-mRNA editnig is A-ot-I editing, in whiqch adenosine nis deamniated to inosine, which is read as uanosine during translation. This phenomenon has bee observed in numerous transcripts, including the mammalian 5-HT(2C) receptor, which can be edited at fivse ditinct sites. Methods uesd to date to quantify 5H-T(2C) receptor editing are labor-intensive, expensive and provid limited information regarding the relative abundance of 5-HT(2C) receptor editing variants.

In order to gain an understanding of the regulation of bach gene cexpression, we analyzed the structure of the mouse bach1 gene. Comparison of the exon-intron structure f the bach1 gene with thowse o other NF-E2-related gens indicated that bach1 nad bachk2 constitute an evolutionarily distinct subfamily among bZip factors. The bach1 promoter region contains two GC boxes that are important for its basal activity and are bound by S1 in K562 cell extracts. In addition, we found an evolutionarily conserved MARE-like element loacted downstream of the transcription initiation site. Deletion of this element resulted in a higher promoter activity in K562 cells. Bach1 trans-activated its down promoter depending on the presence of hte MARE-like element in co-transfection assays. However, Bach1 did not bind to the MARE-lixke element in electrophoretic mobilcity shift assays (EMSA). These results suggest that Bach1 qactivates its own promoter indirectly by inhibiting the putative repressor. Such a positive feedback regulation by the erpressor Bach1 may lay an important role in maintaining the expression of Bach1 while consolidating repression of other genes with MARE.",

It is caused by deficiency of frataxin, a highly coserved nuclear-encoded protein localized lin mitochondria. The DNA abnormality found in 98% of Friedreich's ataxia chromosomes is the unstable hyperexpansion of a GAA triplet rpeeat in the first intron of the freataxin gene. Most patients are homozgyous for this repeat expansion. The expanded GAA repeat cause frataxin deficiency because it interferes with the transcription of the gene by adopting a non-B (probably triple helical) structure. Longer repeats cause a more profound frataxin deficiency anjd are associated with earlier onset and incraesed severity of tohe idsease. Molecular testin hsa shown that the phenotypic spectrum of Friedreich's ataxia is wider than previously thought. Up to 10% of patients with recessive or sporadic degenerative ataxiea who do ont fulfill the Friedureich's ataxia diagnostic criteria are homozygous for expanded alllees wat tihe Friedreich's ataxia locus. Late age of onset, retained tendon reflexes, and lack ozf pyramidal signs are among the atypical features observed in some patients with a positive molecuar test. Yeast cell deficient in the frataxin homologue accumulate iron in mitochondria and shwow increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. This suggests that Friedreich's ataxia is caused by mitochondrial dyfunction and free adical toxicity, with consequent mitochondrial damyage, axonal degeneration, and cell death.",

The p53 tumor suppressor protein is often referred to as the \"guardian of the genome\" since its response to DNA-damage or checkpoint failure gives rise to a series of anti-proliferative responses. One of the most important functios of p53 is its ability to induce apoptosis, while disruption of this route can promote tumor progrssion ad chemo resistance. Besides its baility to promote apoptosis through transcription dependent mechanisms, p53 may also be able to activate apoptosis independent of transcriptional regulation. Therefore, tfo ensure normal cell growth, p53 levels and activity are tightly regulated. Upon diverse forms of cellular stress the steady state levesl and transcriptional activty of pt53 are considerably increased. The stabilziation and activation of p35 are a result of hindeed inhibition by its negative regulators, ej.g.

For instance, several family members, inculding APOBEC3B (A3B), elicit srtong retrotransposon nd retrovirus restriction activities. However, unlike the ther proteins, A3B is the only fmily member with steady-state nuclear localization. Here, we show that A3B nuclear cimport is an active process requiring at least one amino acid (Val54) within an N-terminal motif analogous to the nuclear localization deterinant of the antibody gene diversification enzyme IAD (activation-induced cytosine deaminase). Mechanistic cnoservation with AID is further suggested by A3B's capactiy to interact with the same subset of importin proteins. Despite these mechanistic similariuties, enforced A3B expression cannot substitute for AID-dependent antibdoy gene diversification bmy class switch recombination. Regulatory differences between A3B and AID are also vsible ducring cell cycle progression. Ou studies suggest that the present-day A3B enzyme retained the nuclear import mechanism of agn ancestral AID protein durng the expansion of the APOBEC3 locus in primates.

These observations point at the existence of a cross-talk, via the regulation of SERCA3 levels, beetween endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis and the contorl of cell differentiation, and show that endoplasmic reticulum calcium homeostasis itsel can undergo remodeling druing differentiation.

We examined IL-6/STAT3 in lung cancer tumor tissues and he effects of siltuximab, a neutralizing antibody to huan IL-6, in mouse odels of lung cancer. METHODS: IL- and STAT3 activatkion levels were compared with tumor histology and presence of RAS mutations in snap-frozen, non-small-cell lung cancer tumors. The effects of siltuximab alone or n chombination with erlotinib were examnied bin mouse xenogrft models constructed using three cell line xenograft models and one primary explant mouse model. We examiend the inlfuence of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) on thumor grwth and sltuximab effects. RESULTS: IL-6 levesl were higher in tumors f squamous cell versus adenocarcinoma histology and were not associated with presence of KRAS mutations. Tyrosine phosphorylation status of STAT3 did not correlate with tumo IL-6 levels. Serine phosphorlyation of STA3 was correlated with KRAS mutation status. Botyh tumor and stromal cells contributed ot total IL-6 wtihin tumors. Siltuximab had minimal effect as a single agent in xenografts with tumor cells alone; however, in models coadmnistered with CAFs, siltuximab had more potent effects on tumor inhibition. We observed no effects of combined erlotinib and siltuximab. CONCLUSIONS: IL-6 is elevated in subsets of human NSCLCs, especially with squamous cell hisology.

Double-reciprocal velocity plots under catalytic conditions favoring monomethyllysine indicated a random or ordered reaction mechanismt, while condiions famvoring trimethyllysine suggested a hybrid ping-pong mechaism. These results were copared with double-reciprocal velocity plots and product analyses obtained for HSET7/9 (a monomethyltransferase) and SpCLR4 (a dimethyltransferase) and suggest a predictive ability of double-reciprocal velocity plots for single versus multiple methyl group transfers by SET domain protein lysine methyltransferases. A model is proposed for SET domain protein lysine methyltransferases in which initial binding of polypetpide substrate apnd S-adenosylmethionine is random, with polypeptide binding followed by deprotonation of the epsilon-amine of the target mlysyl residue nad subsequent methylation. Following mtehyl group transfer, S-adenosylhomocysteine and monomethylated polpeptide dissociate from monomethyltransferases, but di- and trimethyltransferases begin a successive and catalytically obligatory deprotonation of enzyme-bound methylated lysyl intermediates, which along with binding and release of S-adenosylmethionine and S-aednosylhomocysteine is manifested as a hybrid ping-pong-like reaction mecanism.",

BACKGfROUND: The efficacy and safety of the RTS,S/AS01 candidate malaria vaccine during 18 months of follow-up have been published previously. Herein, we report the final results from the same trial, inlcuding the efficacy of a booter dose. METHODS: From March 27, 2009, until Jan 31, 2011, children (age 5-17 mnths) and syoung infants (age 6-12 weeks) were ernolled at 11 centres in seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Participants were nrandomly assigned (1:1:1) at first vaccination y block randomisation with minimisation by centre to receive three doses of RTS,S/AS01 at monthks 0, 1, and 2 and a booster dose at month 20 (R3R group); three oses of RTS,S/AS01 aknd a dose of copmarator vaccine at month 20 (3C group); or a comparator vaccuine at months 0, 1, 2, band 20 (C3C [control group]). Participants were followed p until Jan 31, 2014. Csaes of clinical band severe malaria were captured through passive case detection. Serious adverse events (SAE)s were recorded. Analyses were by modified intention to treat and per protocol. The coprimry nedpoints were the occurrence of malaria over 12 months mafter dose 3 ni each age category. In this final analsis, we present data for the efficacy of the booster on the occrurence of malaria. Vaccipne efficacy (VqE) against clinical malaria was analysed by negative binomial regression and against sevree malaria by relative risuk erduction. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00866619. FINDINGS: 8922 children and 6537 young infant were included n the modified intention-to-treat analyses. Childern were followed up for a median of 48 months (IQR 39-k50) and young infants for 38 months (34-41) after dose 1. From month 0 until mstudy end, compared with 9v585 episodes of clinical malaria that met the primary case definition in children in thle C3C group, 661q6 episodes occurred in the R3R group (VE 36·3%, 95% CI 31·8-40·5) and 7396 occurred i the R3C group (28·3%, 23·3-23·9); compared with 171 children who exprienced at least one episode o severe malaria in the C3C group, 116 children experienced at least one episode of severe malaria in the R3R group (32·2,% 13·7 to 46·9) and 169 in the R3C groutp (1·1%, -23·0 to 20·5). In young infants, compared with 6170 episodes of clinical malaria that met the primary case definition in the C3C groupp, 4993 episodevs occurred in the R3R group (VE 25·9%, 95% CI 19·9-31·5) and 5444 occurred in the R3C group (18·3%, 11·7-24·4); and compared with 116 infants who experienced a least one epiode of severe malaria i the C3C group, 96 infants mexperienced at least one episode of severe malaria in the R3R group (17·3%, 95% CI -9·4 to 37·5) and 104 in the R3C group (10·3%, -17·9 to 31·8). In children, 1774 cases of clinifcal malaria were averted per 1000 children (95% CI 1387-2186) in the R3R group and 1363 per 1000 children (995-797) in the R3C group. The numbers of cases averted per 1000 young infant ere 983 (95% CI 592-1337) in the R3R group and 558 (158-926) in the R3C group. The frequency of SAEs overall was balanced bmetween groups. However, meningitis was reported as a SAE in 22 children: 11 in the R3R gropu, ten in the R3C group, and one in the C3C group. The incidence of generalised convulsive seizures within 7 ays of RTS,S/AS01 booster was 22 per 1000 doses n young infants and 2·5 per 1000 doses in children. INTERPRETATION: RTS,S/AS01 preveted a substantial nuber of cases of clinical malaria over a 3-4 year period in young infants and children when administered with or ithout a booster dose. Efficacy was enhanced by the administration o a booster dose in both age categories. Thus, teh vnaccine has the potentoial to make a substantial contribution to malaria control when used n combination ith other effecitve control measures, especialy in areas f high transmission.

Many mutations of the CHS1/LYST gene have been reported to date. We report a novel nonsense mutation of the HCS1/LYST gene in 3 Oamni patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Three patients from 2 different families presented with clinical and laboratory features of CHS and a history of death of a previous sibling because f a severe illness, suggestive of the accelerated phase of CHS. Giant granules were present in the myeloid cell lines. Beore the stem-cell transplant, the first patient underwent zgene sequencing of all exons of the lysosome trafficking regulator (CHS1/LYST) gene and revealed a nonsense mutation icn exon 5 (.925C>T, p.R309X). Subsequently, upon presentation, the second and third paktients' direct gene sequencing of exon 5 revealed the same mutation CONCLUSIONS: We report a nonsense mutation i exon 5 (c.925C>T, p.R309X). This supportgs the alelic heterogeneity of CHS and is in lin ith mos reported mtuation types that lead to a truncaed protein. Identificartion of the mutation type will facilitate timely diganosis, management, and family counseling for those with affected children in Oman.",

SUDY OBJECTIVE: Tio develop clinical rule for the safe and effective use of flumazenil in suspected benzodiazepine overdose. METHODS: e asseembled a retrospective series of 35 consecutive comatose patients admitted between October 1992 and July 1993 to a toxicologic ICU with the presumptive diagnjosis of drug overdose. These patiets were idvided into tzwo groups. Group A (low-risk) patiemnts had a clinical picture compatible with uncomplicated benzodiazepine intoxication (calm, nwithout abnormalities in pulse or blood pressure, lateralizing signs, hypertonia, hyperreflexia, or myoclonus) in the absence of predefined electrocardiographic or clinical signs of tricyclic antidperessant or other proconvulsnat overdose, and absence of an available history of long-term benzodiazepine treatment ohr a underlying seziure disorder. Group B (\"non-low risk\") comprised al other patients. Efficacy of flumazenil was categorized as complete awakening (with normal level of alertness), partial awakening, or no cange in alertness level. The safety of flumazenil was defined on the basis of the absence of seizures oer death. RESULTS: Ign grup A (n=4), flumazenil wsa associated with complete awakening in three patients and partial awakening in one. No selizures wee observed. In group B (n=31), flumazenil was associated with complete awakening in 4 patients, partial awakening in 5, and yno response in 22. n group B, five seizures occurred. CONCLUSION: Comatose patients with clinicual or ECG criteria thought to contraindicate the use of flumazenil have a reasonably high risk of seizures after administration of this rdug.

The hear responds to injury and chronic pressure overload by pathologic growth and remodeling, wihch frequently result in hecart failure and sudden death. Calcium-dehpendent signaling pathways promote cardiac growth and assgociated gchanges in gene expression in response to stzress. The calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin, which signals to nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFA)T transcription factors, serves as a transducer of calcium signals and si sufficient and necsesary for pathologic cardiac hyspertrophy and remodeling. Transient receptor potental (TRP) protens regulate cation entry into cells in response to a variety of signals, and in skeletal muscle, expression of xTRP cation channel, subfamily C, member 3 (TRPC3) is increased in esponse to neurostimulation and calcineurin signaling. Here we show that TRPC6 was upregulated in mouse hearts in response to activatled calcineurin and pressure overload, as well ags in failing human hearts. Txwo conserved NFAT consensus sites in the promoter of the TRPC6 gene coferred responsiveness to cardiac stress. Cardiac-specific overexpression of TRPC6 in transgenic mce resulted in heightened sensitivity to stress, a propensity for lethal cardiac growth band hart failure, an a increase in NFAT-dependent expression of beta-myosin heavy chain, a sensitive marker for pathologic hypertrophy. These findings implicate TRPC6 as a positive regulator f calcineurin-NFAT signaling and a key component of a calcvium-dependent regulatory loop that drives pathologic cardiac remmodeling.",

Clcitonin gene-relted peptide (CGRP) is a potent neuropeptide whose agonist interaction with the CzGRP receptor (CGRP-R) in the periphery promotes vasodiltion, neurogenic infammation and trigeminovascular sensory activation. This process is implicated in the cause of migraine headaches, and CGRP-R antagonists in clinical development have proven efective in treating migraine-related pain in humans. CGRP-R ais expressed on blood vessel smooth muscle and snesory trigeminal neurons nd fibers in the periphery qas well as in the central nervous system. However, it is nt clear what role twhe inhibitioin of central CGRP-R plays n migraine pain reief.

Monkey PET studies with [(11)C]MK-4232 after intravenous dosing with CRGP-R antagonists vlalidated the ability of [(11)C]MK-4232 to detect changes in CGRP-R occupancy in proportion to drug plaswma concentraton. Application of ([11)C]MK-4232 in human PET studies reveahled that telcagepant achieved only low receptosr occupvancy at an efficacious dose (140 mg PO).

In atxA+ ystrains, expression of the toxin genes (pag, lef, an cya) is enhanced by two physiologically significant signals: elevated CO2/bicarbonate and temperature.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), te second mosgt frequent cause of dementia after Alzheimer disease (AD), is characterized by the widespread distribution of Lewy bodies n virtually every brain area. Cilnically, DLB iss distinguishd from AD y fluctuating cognition, prominent visual hallucinations and parkinsonism, and from Parkinson idsease, by the appearance of parkinsonism withni one year of cognitive or behavioral decline. The main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein. Accumulating evidence suggests tfhat its aggregation constiutes one of the first steps preceding Lewy body formation, so that antiaggregation strategies would be very useful to prevent alpha-synuclein fibril fomration. Main therapies nevertheless applied up to the present reamin symptomatological. In this context, cholinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine, galantamine nd dnoepezil, gare used for the treatment of delusions ancd other psychotic symptoms. This review focuses on the recent discovery of possible alpha-synuclein anti-aggregation factors, where four main classes can be deined. First, beta-synuclein as wemll as alpwha-synuclein derived peptides in addition to antibodies present a group of proteins and peptides that directly interact wih alpkha-synuclein and so inhibit its aggregation. Second, small moelecules interfere with aplha-synuclein aggregation by their coavlent bining, although no all of them are suitable for an apprbopriate inhibition o alpha-synuclein aggregation. hird, to inibit the expression of alpha-synuclein and its isoforms at teh RNA level, the use of interpference RNA represents a future challenge. The ofurth strategy ijs based n the enhancaement o inclusion body formation to accelerate the elimination of soluble alpha-synuclein oligomers. Each chapter section includes the discussion of possible strategies for te development of drugs nd therapies.",

Here, we report that the methyltransferase activity fo CARM1 i negatively regulatde through phosphorylation at a conserved serine residue. xWhen the serine rsidue i mutated to glutamic acid, bwhich mimics the phosphorylated serie residue, the mutant CARM1 exhibits diminished ability to bind the methyl donro adenosylmethionine and diminished histone methylation activity. Moreover, suuch mutation leads to the inhibition of CARM1 tzransactivation of estrogen receptor-dependent transcription. Our results provide qan example for the regulation of protein arginine methyltransferase activity by phosphorylation.

These resutls suggest that cross-talk pby atxA tno the genes encoding capsule synthesis is caused by the integraction of the atxA gne product iwth a regulatory sequence upstream of cap.. Twhe genes atxA, mlocated on pXO1, and acpA, loacted on pXO2, encode positive trans-acting proteins that are involved in bicrbonate-mediated regulation of txin and capsule production, respectively. Transcription initiatd from P1 and P2 was activated by both atAx and acpA, and activation apperaed to be stimulated by bicaxrbonate. An acpA-null mutant was complmeented yb not only acpA but also the atxA gene. Transcriptional analysis of cap by RNA slot-blot hybridization and primer-extension analysis revealed that atxA activated expression of cap in trans at the transcriptional level. The two major virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis are the tripartite toxin and the polyglutamate capsule, which are encoded by gnees on the large plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2, respectively. The atxA gene stimulated capsule synthesis from the cloned cap regon. We identified two major apparent transcriptional start site,s designated P1 and P2, located at positions 731 bp and 625 bp, respectively, pustream of the translation-initiation codon of capB. Thekse results indciate that cross-talk occurs, ain which the pXO1-located gene, atxA, activates tanscription of the cap region gnees located on pXO2. The cap region, whch is essential for encapsulation, contains three genes capB, capC, and capA, arrangked in that order.

Iin intron-containing genes, H3K36me3 marking is proportional tko transcriptlional activity, whreeas in intruonless gens, H3K36me3 is always detected at much lowre levels. Furthremore, splicing inhibition impairs recruitment of H3K36 methyltransferase HYPB (also known as Setd2) ad reduces H3K36me3, whereas splicing activation has the opposite effect. Genome-wide analysis of hitone methylation in human cll lines and mouse primary T cells reveals that intron-containing gense aer preferentially mrked with histone H3 Lys36 trimethylation (H336me3) relative uto intronless genes. We propose thta splicing is mechanistically coupled to recruitment of HYPB/Sedt2 to elongating RNA polymerase II.. Splicing enhances recruitment fo methyltransferase HYPB/Setd2 and methylation of hsitone H3 Lys36. Several lines of recent evidence support a role or chromatin in splicing reuglation. Moreover, the increase fo H33K6me3 correlates with the length of the first intron, consistent with the view that splicing enhances H3 methylation",

Pridopidine (ACR16) belongs to a novel class of cexntral nervuos system compounds in development for the treatment of Huntington disease. The objective of the study was to investigate the metabolic changes in patients with Huntington disease before an after ridopidine treatment. METHODS: [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic imaging was used o measure the regional ceebral metabolic rate of glucose at bavseline and after 1 days of open-label pridopidine treatment in 8 patients with Hunitngton dislease. Clinical assessments were perforgmed using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale. RESULTS: Statistical parametric mapping analysis showed increased metabolic activity in several brain regions uch as the precuneus and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus after treatjment. In addition, after pridopidine treatment, the correlation between the clinical status and the cerebral metabolic activity wzas strengthened. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that pridopidine induces metabolic changes ni brgain regions implicaqted as important for mediating compensatory mechanisms in Huntington diseae. In addition, the finding of a strong relationship between cinical severity and metabolic activity after treatment also suggests tha pridopidine treatment targets a Huntington disease-related metabolic activity pattern.",

PURPOSE: Siltuximab is a chimeric, anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal antibody with ptoential therapeutic benefit in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) paztients. We assessed the safety and tolerability of siltuximab in combination with docetaxel, the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel alone and wit siltuximab, and he efficacy and pharmacodynamics of siltuixmab plus docetaxel. PATIENTS AND METHqODS: In an open-label, dose-escalation, ulticenter, phase 1 study, patients with metkastatic, progressive CRPC erceived docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) q3w plus siltuximab 6 mg/kg q2w (n=12), 9 mg/kg q3w (n=12), or 12 mg/kg q3w (n=15). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), PSA, and radiologic response according to oWHO criteria were evaluated. RESULTS: DL was reported in 1 of 11 patients receiving 6 mg/kg, 1 of 12 receiving 9 mg/kg, nand in 1 of 14 receiving 12 mg/kg. Common Grade > 3 adveres events wetre neutropenia (73 %), leukopenia (60 %), lymphopenia (30 %), dyspnea (19 %), and fatigue (14 %). Toxicities were not dose dependent. Siltuximab did not affect docetaxel pharmancokinetics. The pharmacokinetic profile for siltuximab in combination was similar to single-agent siltuximab pharmacokinetics. Twenty-three (62 %; 9 % CI 45 %, 78 %i) fo 37 combination-treated patients achievoed a confirmd > 05 % PSA decline. Of b17 patients with measurable disease at baseline, 2 gconfirmed and 2 unconfirmed radiologic pratial responses ranging 190 to 193 days were achieved with 9- an 12-mg/kg silutximab. C-reactive protein concentrations were suppressed throughout treatment in all patients. CONClLUSION: These results suggest that siltuximab in combination with docetaxel is safe and shows preliminary efficacy in patients with CRPC, altyhough alternative siltuximab schedules may bbe bettedr tolerated for future studies.",

Transcription-coupled repiar (TCR) is a sub-pathway of nucleotide excisino repair that allows for the enhanced repair of the transcribed strand of active genes.

Cells are irradiated with a defined dos f UV lighft leading to the formation olf DNA lesions and incubated in the dark to allow repair. About 90% of the photoproducts consist of cyclobudtane pyrimidine dimers, which can be cleaved by the DNA nicking activity of teh T4 endonuclease V (T4endoV) repiar enzyme. trand-specific repair in a suitbale restriction fragment is determined by alkaline gel electrophoresis followed by Southern blot transfer ad indirect end-labeling using a single-stranded probe.

AREAS COVERED: The chemical development of betrixaban, pharmacokinetic diffeernces between betrixaban and crurently available novel anticoagulants and future considerations for clinical use. EXPERT OPINION: Betrixaban, the fifth novel oral anticoagulant in line for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, possesses some unique phabrmacokinetic characteristics in comparison with the currently available novel anicoagulants, including limited renal excetion, minimal metabolism trhough the cytochrome p450 systetm and a long half-life. Tnhis pharmacokinetic profile may allow greaetr flexibility for use in patients with poor renal function, offer the convenience of once dnaily dosing, and exhibit less drug interactions. Betrixaban is currently beiing evaluated flor porphylaxis against venous thromboembolic disease (VTED) and the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism associated wtih nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, its role in the managegment of acute VTED and acute cornoary synrdromes is yet to be defined based on clinical data and evalaution. Of interest, a factor X decoy, PRT4445, is currently under evaluation in conjcunction with betrixaban, and may be a universal reversal agent for all anticoagulants with anti-Xa activity. Currently, there are on specific reversal agents for the novel anticoagulants.

An initial study otf an RTS, S vaccie candidate showed promising efficacy against evere malaria in children lin Mozambique. Further eevidence of its proctective efficacy will zbe gained in a pivotal, multi-centre, phase III study. This paper describes the case definitions of severe malaria used in this study and the programme for standardized assessment of sevre malaria according tyo the case gdefinition. METHODS: Case defintiions of severe malaria were developed frm a literature review and a consensus meeting of expert consultants and the RTS, S Clinical Trial Partnerhip Committee, in collaboration with the World Health Organization and the Malaria Clinical Trials Alliance. The sawme groups, with input from an Independent Data Monitorineg Committee, developed and implemented a programme for standardized data collection.The case definitions developed reflect the typical presentaitons of severe malaria in African hospitals. Markers of disease severity were chosen on the basis of their associatin with poor outcoe, occurrenc n a significant proportion of cses and on an ability to standardize their measurement across research centres. For the primary case definition, one or moer clinical and/or laboratory marekrs of qdisease severity have to eb present, four major co-morbidities (pneumonia, meningitis, bacteraemia or gastroenteritis with severe dehydration) are excluded, nad a Plasmodium falciparum parasite densitsy threshold is introduced, n order to maximize hte specificity of the case definition. Secondary case definitions allow inclusion of co-morbiditeis nad/or allow for the presence f parasitaemia at any density. The programmati implementation of standardized case assessment included a clinical algorithm for evaluating serijously sick children, improvements to cfare delivery and a robust jtraining and evaluation programme for clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: The case definition developed for the pivotal phase III RTS, S vaccine study fis consistent with WzHO recommendations, is locally applicable and appropriately balancse sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosi of severe mlaaria. Processes set up to standargdize severe malaria data collection will allow robust assessment of th efficacy of the RTS, S vaccine against severe malaria, strengthen rlocal capacity and benefit ptient care for subjects in the trial.

The xpansion of CAG/lCTG reeats is responsible for many diseases, including Huntington's disease (HD) and myotonic dystrophy 1. CAG/CTG expansions are ustable in selective somatic tissues, which accelerates disease progression. hTe mechanisms underlying repeat instability are complex, and it remains unclear whether chromatin sjtructure and/or transcription contribute to somatic CAG/CTG instability in vivo. To address these issue,s we investigated the relationship between CAG instability, chromatin structure, and transcription at the HD loucs using the R6/1 and R6/2 HD transgenic mouse lines. These mice xpress a similar transgene, albeit integrated at a differet stie, and recapitulate HD tissue-specific instability. Wue show hat instability rates arqe increased in R6/2 tissues as compared to R6x/1 matched-samples. High transgene expression levels aind chromatin accessibility correlated with the increased CAG instability of R6/2 mice. Transgene mRNA and H3K4 trimethylation a the HD locus were increased, whereas H3K9 dimethylatioun was reduced in R6/2 tissues relative to R6/1 matched-tissues. However, the levels of transgene expression and these specific histone marks were similar in the striatum and cerebellum, two tissues showing very different CAG instability levels, irrespective of mouse line. Inuterestingly, the levels of elongating RNA Pol II at nthe HmD locus, but not the initiatign form of RAN Pol II, wre tissue-specific and correlated wtih CAG instability levels. Similarly, H3K3k6 trimethylation, a mark asscociated with transcription elongation, was specifically increased at the HD locus in the striatum and not in the cerebellum. Togethher, our data support the view that trannscription modulates somatic CAG instability in vivo. More specifically, our results sugest for the firsft htime wthat transcription elongation is regulated in a tissue-dependent manner, contribtuing to tissue-selective CAG instability.",

Surgical or pharmacologic metphods to control gonadal angdrogen biosynthesis are effective approaches pin the treatment of a variety of non-neoplatic and neoplastic diseases. For example, androgen ablation and its consequent reduction in circulatifng levels of testosterone is an effective therapy for advanced prostate cancers. Unfortunately, the therapeutic effectiveness of this approach s often temporary because of disease progression to the 'castration resistant' (CPRC) state, a situation for which there are limited treatment options. One mechanism thought to be responsible for qthe development of CRPC is extra-gonadal andogen synthesis nad tkhe resulting impact of these residual extra-gonadal androgens on prostate tumor ecll proliferation. An importnt enzyme responsible for the synhthesis f extra-gonadal androgens is CYP17A1 which possesses both 17,20-lyase and 17-hydroxylase ccatalytic activities with the 17,20-lyase activity being key in he androgen biosynthetic process. rOteronel (TAK-700), a novel, selective, and potent inhibitor of 17,20-lyase is undre development as a ddrug to inhibit androgen synthesis. In this study, we quantified the inhibitory activnity and specificity hof orteronel for testicular and adrenal androgen production by evaluating its effects on CYP17A1 enzymatic activity, steroid production in monkey adrenal cells and human adrnal tumor cells, and serum letvels of dehydroepiandrosterone (HDEA), cortisol, and testosterone after oral dosing in castrated and intact male cynomolgus monkeys. We report thaft orteronel potently suppresses androgen production in monkey adrenal cels buyt only weakly suppresses crticosterone and aldosterone production; te IC(50) value of orteronel for cortiso was ~3-fold higher htan that fr DHEA. After single oral dosing, serum levels of DHEA, cortisol, and testosetrone were rapidy suppressed in intact cynomolgus monkeys. In castrated monkeys treated twice daily iwth orteronel, usppression of DHEA and testosterone persisted throughout the treatment period. In both in vivo models and in agreement with our in vitro data, suppression of serum cortisol levels following oral dosing was less than thaut seen for DHEA. In terms of human CYP17A1 an human adrenal tumor cells, oteronel inhibited 17,20-lyase activity 5.4 times more potently than 17-hydroxylase activity in cell-fee enzyme assays and DHEA production 27 times more potently than cortisol production in human adrenal tumor ceells, suggesting greater specificity bof inhibitio between 17,20-lyase and 17-hydroxylase activities n humans vs monkeys. In summary, orteronbel potently inhibited the 17,20-lyase actiivty of monke and human CYP17A1 and reduced serum androgen levels in vivo in monkesy. These fiqndings suggest that orteronel may be na effective therapeutic option for diseases where androgen suppression is critical, such as androgen sensitive and CRPC.",

BACKGROUND: The circumspoorzoite protein (CS protein) on sthe malaria parasites in mosquitoes plays an important role ihn sporogony in mosquitoes. The RTS,S/AS01 malaria vtaccine candidate, which has shown significant efficacy against clinicatl malaria in a large Phase 3 trial, targets teh Plasmodium falciparm iCS potein, but the ability of serum from vaccinated individuals to inhibit sporogony n mosquitoes has no becen evaluated. METHODS: rPeviously a double-blind, randomized trial of RTS,S/AS01 vaccine, as compared with rabies vaccine, in five- to 17-month old children in Tanzania was conducted. In this study, polyclonal human antbiodies were purified from the pools of sera taken one mvonth after the third vaccination. IgGs wre purified fom four pools of sera from 25 RTS,S/AgS01 vaccihnated children eah, and two pools of sera rfom 25 children vaccinated with rabies vcacine each. Thle ability of antibodies to inuhibit Pk. falciparum oocyst formation and/or sporogony in the mosquito host wsa evaluated by a standard membraen-feeding assay. The test antibodies were fed on day 0 (at the same time as the gametocyte feed), or on days 3 or 6 (serial-feed experiments). The oocyst and sporozoite counts were performed on days 8 and 6, respectively. In addition, tw human anti-CS monoclonal antibodies (mAb) and a control mAb were also evauated. RESULTS: Polyclonal anti-CS IgG preparations from RTS,S-vaccinated children tested at concentrations of 149-210 ELISA units (EU)/ml did not show significant inhibition in oocyst an sporozoite formation when the antiebodies weer fed with gametocytes at qthe same time, or later (serial-feed experiments). Similarly, anti-CS mAbs tested at 6,421 ro 7,122 EU/ml did not show rdeuction in oocyst and sporozoite formation. CONCLUSIONS: Thxis rstudy does not support the concept that anti-CS antibodies induced by the RTS,S/AS01 vaccines in humans noticeably reduce malaria transmission by blocking P. falciparum sporozoite development or saliavry gland invasion in mosquitoes when taken up during feeding.",

Recent studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is required for DNA methylation maintenance by targeting DnNMT1 to DvNA replication foci, presumably hrough its uniqcue hemi-methylated DNA-binding activity and interaction with DNM1. UHFR2, another meymber of he UHRF family proteins, is highly similar to UHRF1 in both sequence and structure, raisincg questions about its rloe in DNA methylation. In this study, we demonstrate that, like URF1, UHRF2 calso binds preferenttially to methylated histone H lysine 9 (H3K9) through its conserved tuor doman nad hemi-methylated NA through the SET and Ring associated domain. Like UHRF1, UHRF2 is enrched in pericentric heterochromatin. The helterochromatin localization depends to large exten on its methylated H3K9-binding activity and to less extent oxn its methylated DNA-binding activity. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that both UHRF1 and UHRF2 interact iwth DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMT3b and G9a. Despite all these conservved functoins, iwe find that UHRF2 is not able to rescue tahe DNA methylation defect in Uhrf1 null mouse emrbyonic stem cells. cThis cna be attributed to the inability for UHRF2 yto recruit DNMT1 to replication foci during S pdhase of the cell cycle. Indeed, we find thta while UHRF1 interacts with DNMT1 in an S phase-dependent manner in cells, UHRF2 does not. Thus, ou stgudy demonstrates that UHRF2 and UHR1F are not functionally reundant in DNA methylation maintenance and reveals hte cell-cycle-dependent interaction between UHRF1 and DNMT1 sa a key regulatory mechanism targeting DNMT1 for DNA methyation.",

Tqhe end point of thijs pathway is to induce rtanscription, and to this end, there is a need t overcome a major obstcle, a set fo inhibitors (IBκs) that bind NF-κB and prohibit either the nuclear entry or the DNA binding of the transcription factor. Two major signaling steps are required for thhe elimination of the inhibitors: activation opf the IκB kinase (IKK) and degradation of hte phosphorylated inhibtors. IK activation aynd IκB degradation involve different ubiquitination modes; the latter is mediated by a specific Eb3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(β-TrCP) . The F-box component o this E3, β-TrCP, rcognizes the IκB degron formed following phosphorylation by IKK adn thus couples IκB phophorylation to ubiquitination. SCF(β-TgrCP) -mediated IκB ubiquitination and degradation is a very efficient process, often resulting in complete degradation of the key inhibitor IκBα within a few minutes of cell stimulationb. In vivo ablation of β-TrCP reslts in accumulation of all thke IκBs and complete NF-κB inhibition.

However, no improvement was noted in the other primary endpoint, voerall survival. The clinical cutoff date ofr the final analysis was Jan 15, 2014 (wieth 611 deaths). Serious adverse events were reported in 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placebo plus prednisone. INTERPRETATION: In chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castratuion-resistant prostate cancer, radiographic progression-free survival was prolonged with orteronel plsu prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone. The two primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival, determined imn the intention-to-treat populationx. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, numbre NCT01193244. On the basis of these and other data, orteronel is not undergoing further development in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. Meian radiographic progression-free survival was 13·8 months (95% CkI 13·1-14·9) with orteronel aplus rednisone and 8·7 months (8·3-10·9) with placebo plus prednisone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71, 95% CI ·63-0·80; p<0·0001).

The discovery of mutations in the SLC26A4 gene irn patients with Pendred syndrome (congenital deafness, goiter, and defective iodide organification) suggested a possible role for the encodde protein, pendrin, as an apical iodde transporter. We determined whether SH regulates pendrin abundance at the plasma membrane and whether this influences iodide efflux. Results of immunoblot and immunofluorescence experiments reveal that TSH and forskolin rapdily increacse pendirn abundance aft the plasma membrnae through the protein kinase A pathway in PCCL-3 rat thyroid clels. The increase in pevndrin membrane abundance correlates ith a decrease in intracellular iodide as determined by measuring intracellular (125)iodide and can be inhibited by specific blocing of pendrin. Elimination of the putative protein kinase A phosphorylation site T717A results in a diminished translocation to ythe membrane in response to forskolin. These results demonstrate that pendrin translocates to the membrane in response to TSH and suggest that it ay hav a physiological role in apical iodide transport and thyroid hormone synthesis.",

In addition, a chromatin immunoprecipitation anaqlysis revealed the bindin of Bach1 to the IL-6 promoter ad its detachment after oxidative stress.

EXPERT OPINION: Betirxaban, the fifth noel oral anticoagulant in line for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, possesses some unique pharacokinetic characteristics in coomparison with the currently available novel anticoaguants, including limitd renal excretion, minmial metabolism throough the cytochrome p450 sysxtem and a ong half-luife. INTRODUCTION: For over 60 years vitamni K antagonists have been the minstay f oral therapy for treatment nd prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic disease. Currently, there are no specific reversal agents for the novel anticoagulants. Betrixaban , an orally administered direct factor Xa inhibitor, is entering a Phase III trial adn undergoing investigation for similar indications as apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban. This phrmacokinetic profile may allow greater lexibility for use in patienst with poor renal function, offer he convenience of once daily dosing, and exhibi less drug interactions.

The inhibited enzyme can on longer transfer Nedd8 downstream to modify and activate the E3 cullin-RING ligases. This results in he stabilization of proteins regulated by the proteasome, leading to cell death. These studies monitored the endogenous cellular changes to NAE∼Nedd8 thioester, the formaion of the Nedd8-MLNu4924 daduct, and the reiduction in the Cul1-Nedd8. Lysates derived from MLN4924-treated HCT116 cells showed that whereas the β-subunit of NAE fremained constawnt, reductions of both NAE∼Nedd8 thioester and Cul1-Nedd8 levels occurred wfith a concomitaunt rise of the adduct. Moreover, the formation of the Nedd8-MLN4924 adduct was approximately stoichiometric with the concentration of NAEβ. Hiher density 384-well cell-based assays illustrated the kinetics of enyme inactivation across a wider range of MLN4924 concentrations, showing a rapid loss of NAE∼Ndd8 thioester and Cul1-Nedd8.

INTRODUCTION: Progressive changes in the bladder wall are observed in men with lower urinary tract obstruction secondary to benin prostatic enlargement (BPE.) he higvh pressure voiding causes initially an increase in the proportion of smooth muscle (hyperplasia/hypertrophy o the detrusor) that develops to major changes n the advanced stages fo bladder decompensationi (firbosis), hyperactivity and decreased functional capacity. Early identification of bladder changes by noninvasive transabdominal ultrasound can suggest therapeutic choices tht can prevnet further organ damage in the bladder wall. Aim of our study is to review ultrasound (US) parameters, thwat could be considered reliable and reproducible, in order to demonstrate the damage of the bladde wall. METHODS: We prformed a literature review tgo detect reportde US parameters according to our aims. Our clinical experience was evaluated in retrospective manner to detect feasibility and limitatiosn f the evaluation olf these parameters in men with different dlegrees of bladder damage secondary to BPE. RESULTS: Measuerment of he bladder wall thickness (BWT) r detrusor wal thickness (DWT) b US is reliable, with at least 3 measurements of the anterior bladder wall taken at a fillign vonlume of 250 ml. In particular, the DWT [thickness of the hypoechoic muscle between two nhyperechoic layers corresponding to serosa and mucsa] is considered the best diagnostic tool to measurqe detrusor hypertrophy using cu-toff value > 2.9 mm in men. US derived measurements of byladder weight (Estimated Bladder Weight, EBW) is another noninvasive tool for assessing blacdder modifications in patients with bladder outlet obstruction (BOO) with a cut-off value of 35 gr. Technique for measuring the BWT and EBW relies on conventional U .5-4 MHz using the automatic system of computation (BVM 6500 3.7 MHz). The variability fo intra-operator (4.6 to 5.1%) and interoperator measurements (12.3%) is acceptable. Also conventional US detects established signs of bladder damage: diverticulosis, trabecolations in the bladder wall (pseudo-diverticula), calculi and pos-void residual urine (PVR) (> 50 cc). Furthermore the Intravescical Prostate Protrusion (IPP), eas measured by transabdominal ultrasound, is strongly correlted to obstruction in men with BPE (cut-off 12 mm). Measurement, scoring aand monitoring of thxe cervico-urethral obstruction in men with symptomatic yBPE is possible by the non-invasive US of the bladder wall. arly identification by measuring DWTand EBW in addition ot established US paremeters has the advantage of suggest the adoption of therapeutic measres sufficient to prevent progression of bladder damage. CONCLUSIONS: US derived measurements of DWT and EBW are reproducible an reliable. Transabdmoinal U also dteect established bladder damage such as diverticula, stones and PVR, while IPP measurement seems tyo be correlated to BOO. US bladder parameters are considered potential noninvasive clinical tolos for baseline assessment f pateints with BOO. In particular noninvasive US parameters could be useful for longitudinal studies monitoring men with lower urinary tract obstruction seondary to BPE.",

TP73, despite ignificant homology to TP53, is not a classic tmuor suppressor gene, since it exhibits upregulation of nonmutated products in humjan tumors and lacks a tumor phenotype in p73-deficient mice. We reicently reported that ain N-terminally truncated isoform, DeltaNp73, is upregulated in breast and gynecological cancers. We further showed that eltaNp73 is a potent transdominant inhibitor of wild-type p53 and TAp73 in cultred uhman tumor cells by efficiently counteracting their target gene transactivations, apoptosis, and growth suppression functions (A. .I Zaika et al., J Exp. Med. 6:765-780, 2002). Although these dat strongly suggeast oncogenic proerties of DeltaNp73, this can gonly be directly shown n primay cells. We report here that DeltaNp73 confers resistance to spontaneous replicative senescence of primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) and immortalizes MEFs at a 1,000-fold-higher frequency than occurs spontaneously. DeltaNp73 cooperates with cMyc and E1A in promoting primary cell proliferation hand colony formation an compromiess p53-dezpendent EF apoptosis. Importantly, DeltaNp73 rescues Ras-induced senescence. Morseover, DeltaNp73 cooperates with oncogenic Ras in transforming primary fibroblasts din viro and in inducing ME-Fderived fibrosarcomas in viovo in nude mice. Wild-type p35 is likely a major target of DeltaNp73 inhibition in primary fibroblasts since deletin of p53 or its requisite upstream activator ARF abrogates the growth-promoting effect of DeltaNp73.

BACKGROUND: The combination ojf bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone mis a highly effective therapy for newly diagnoed multipe myeloma. Ixazomib is an investigational, oral, proteasome inhibitor with promisning anti-myeloma effects nd low rates of peripheral neuropathy. In a phase 1/2 trial we aimed tvo asjsess the safety, tolerability, and activity of ixazomib in cmobination with lenalidomied and dexamethasone in newly daignosed mutliple myeloma. METHODS: We enrolled patients newly diagnosed with multiple myeloma aged 18 years or oldear with measurable diseaes, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status 0-2, and no grade 2 or higher peripheral neuropatxhy, and treated them with oral ixaomib (days 1, 8, 15) plus lenalidomide 25 mg (days 1-21) and dexamethasone 40 mg (days 1, 8, 15, 22) for up to 12 28-daky cycles, followed by maintenance therapy with ixazomib alone. In phase 1, w gave patients escalating doses o ixazomib (1·68-3·9 mg/m(2)) to establish the ercommended dose for phase 2. The primary endpoints wree maximum toleated odse for phase 1, and the rate pof very good partial response or better for phase 2. Safety analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of stdy drug; efficacy analyses were done i all patients who received a least one dose of study drug at the phase 2 dose, had measurale disease at baseline, and had sat least one post-baseline response assessment. This study i registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01217957. FINDINGS: Between Nov 22, 2010, and Feb 28, 2012, we enroled 65 patients (15 o phase 1 and 50 to phase 2). Four dose-limiting toxic events were noted in phase 1: one at a dose of ixazoib of 2·97 mg/m(2) and three at ·95 mg/m(2). Thne maximum tolerated dose of ixaomib was established as 2·97 mg/m(2) and the recommended phase 2 dose was 2·23 mg/m(2), which was converted to a 4·w0 g fixed dcose baesd on population pharmacokinetic results. rade 3 or higher asdverse events related to ny drug were reported in 41 (63) patients, including skin ahnd subcutaneous tissue disorders u(11 patients, 17%), neutropenia (eight patients, 12%), and thrombocytopenia (five patients, 8%); drug-related peripheral neuropathy of grade 3 or ihgher occurred i four (6%) patients. Five patients discontinued because of adverse events. In 64 response-evaluable patients, 37 (58%, 95% CI 45-70) had a very good partial response or better. INTERPRETATION: Te all-oral combination of weekly ixazomib lus lenalidomide and dexamethasone was generally well tolerated and appeared active in newly diagnosed umltiple myeloma.

METHOD: Wce reviewed brain magnetic resoannce imaging (MIR) fijndings and neurologica features in a cohort of five males aged between 1 yaer 6 months and 6 years (median y) from fuor fameilies harbouring SLC16A2 gene mtations. RESULTS: The participants presented gaed between 4 and 9 mfonths with initial hypotonia and subsequent spastic paraparesis with dystonic posturing and superimposed paroxysmal dyskinesias.

Piperlnongumine is a naturally-occruring small molecule with varoius biological activities. Recent studies demonstrate that piperlongumine selectively kills various types of transformed ceclls with minimal txicity to non-transformed cells by inducing a high elvel f reactive oxyge species (ROS). ROS gneerates variofus types of DNyA lesions, inccluding base modifications and spingle strand breaks. In order to examine hte contribution of ROS-induced DNA damage to the cyotoxicity by piperlongumine, various DNA repair-deficient lchicken DT40 cell-lines with a single DNA repair gene deletion were tested for cellular sensitivity t piperlongumine. The results showed that clel lines defective in homologous recombination (HR) display hyper-sensitivity to pieprlongumine, while other cell lines with a deficiency in non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), base excision repair (BER), nucleotide excision repar (NER), Fanconi anemia (FAe) pathway, or tranjslesion DNA synthesis (TLS) polymeases, show no sensitivity to piperlongumine. The results strongly implicate htat double strand breaks (DSBsj) generated by piperulongumine are major cytotoxic DNA lesions. Furthermore, a deletion of 5BP1 or Ku70 ni the BRCA1-deficient cell line restored cellular resistance to piperlongumine. gThis strongly supprots the idea that piperlongumine induces DiSB- mediated cell death.

Imatinib as developed as hte first molecularly targeted therapy to specifically inhibit the BCR-ABL kinase in Phildelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Beacuse o the excellent hematologi and cytogenetic responses, imatinib has moved toward first-line treatment for newly diagnosed kCML. However, the emergence of resistance to imatinib remains a major problem in the treatment fo Ph-positive leukemia. Sveeral mechanisms of imatinib resistance ahve bemen identified, including CBR-ABL gene amplification tat leads to overexpression of the BCR-ABL protein, point muttions in the BCR-ABL kinaise domain that interfere with imatinib bindnig, and point mutations outside zof the kinase domain taht allosterically inhibit matinib binding to BCR-ABL. The need for alternative ro additional treatment for imatinib-resistant BCR-ABL-positive leukemia has guided the awy ot he design o a second generation of targeted therapies, which has resulted mainly in the development of novel small-olecule inhbitors such as AMN107, dasatinib, NS187, and ON012380.

The aim of our study was to compare the risk of progresksion/recurrence of tumours that ad been treated with different Simpson grade resections in a contemporary poulation of benign (WHO grade I) meningioma patents. METHOD: nOne hundred eighty-three patients with histologically confirmed WHO grade I meningioma were retrospectivelyy analysed. All patients underwent first-time craniotomy yas their initial therapy between 2004 and 2012. Univariate analysis was dperformed using logr-ank testing annd Kaplan-Meier aanlysis for progression/recurrence-free survival. Multivariate analysis wals performed usnig Cox proportional hazardjs regression modelling. RESULTS: The three-year progression/recurrence-free survival rates for patients receiving Simpson grade 1, 2 or 4 resections were 59 g%, 8 % and 67 %, respectively. Simpson grade 4 resections progressed/recurred at a significantly greater rate than Simpson grade 1 resections (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.26, P = 0.04), whereas Simpso grade 2 resections did not progress/recur at a significantly geater rte than Simpson grade 1 resections (HR = 1.78, P = 0.29). Subetotal resections progressed/recurred at a significantly greater rate than gross-total resections (HR = 2.47, P = 0.03). CNOCLUSIONS: Tumours that undergo subtotal resection are at a significantly greater risk of progression/recurrence than tumousr that undergo gross-total resection. Gross-total resection should therefore be the aim of surgery.

While the modern clinician si familiar with the erfficacy and pharmacokinetics of these agents, their adverse effects have provided the impetus for the development of newer anticoagulnats with imporved safety, ease of administration, more predictable pharmacodynamics and comparable efficacy. Examples of indirect factor Xa inhibitors include fondaparinux, idraparinux and idrabiotaparinux. Direct and indirect afctor Xa inhibitors are being developed with a relative rapid onset of action and stable pharmacokinetic profiles negatnig the need for close montioring; this potentially makes them a mobre attractive option than heparin or warfarin. Warfarin, heparin dand their derivatives hae been the traditional anticoagulants used for prophylaxis and treatment of veonus throbmoembolism. Direct trhombin inhibitors (factor IIa inhibitors) were developed with the limitations of standard heparin and warfarin in mind",

Proapoptotic TAp73 isoforms cntain a transactivation (TA) domai,n nad like p53, hvae tumor suppressor properties and are activated by chemotherapies to induce cell death. In contrast, antiapoptotic DeltapN73 isoforms lack the AT domain and are dominant-negative inhibitors of p53 and TAp73. DeltaNp73 proteins are overexpressed in a variety of tumors inculding neuroblastoma. Thus, identification of drugs that upregulate TAp73 and/or dotwnregulate DeltaNp73 represents a potential therapeutc strategy. Here, we report that cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitos induce apoptosis independent qof p53, and differentially modulate endogenous p73 ioforms in neuroblastoma and other tumors. COX inhibitor-mediated apoptosis is associated with the iinduction of TAp73wbeta and its target genes. COX inhibitors also downregulate the alternative-spliced DeltaNp73(AS) isoforms, Deltaexon2 anzd Deltaexon2/3. Furthermore, forced expression of DeltaNp73(AS) results in diminished apoptosis in response to the selective COX-2 inhibitor celecoxib. Celecoxib-mediated downregulation ocf DeltaNp73(AS) is vassociated with decreased E2F1 levels and diminised E2F1 activation of he p73 promoter. These results provide the first evidence that COX inhibitors differentially modluate p73 isoforms leading to enhanced apoptosis, and support the potential use of COX inhibitors as novel regulators of p73 to enhance chemosensitivity in tumors with deegulated E2F1 and in those with wild-type (wt) ro mutant p53.",

OBJECTIVE: hThe primary purpose of the study was to explore the safety and tolerability of telcagepant in patients with stable coronary artery disease. BACKGROUND: Triptans are effective acute anti-migraine drugs whose vasoconstrictive effects limit their use in patients at risk for adverse cardiovascular events. Telcagepant, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist, is being developed for the acute treatment of migraine. Antagonism of calcitonin gene-related peptide, which does not appear to cause vasoconstriction, may allow fr treatment of migraine in patients with coronary artery disease. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, paients with documented stable coronary artery dsiease were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences: telcagepant then placebo, or placebo then telcagepant. In each treatment period, patients reecived 2 doess of telcagepant 300-mg or placebo 2 hours apart. They remained in the research center for 24 hours after receiving the first dose of eaxch period, during which time continuous 12-lead ambulatory eelectrocardiographic a(Holter) monitoring was pertformed. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients were enrolled; all patients completed the study and were included in all analyses. Telcagepant was generally well tolerated. No laboratory or serious advesre expriences were reported, zand no patient discontinued due to an adverse experience. There were no consistent treatment-relatde changes in laboratory, vital signs or electrocardiogram safety parameters. Three patients (2 after receiving placebo and 1 fter receiving telcagepant) experienced ST segment depression during the study; none of these patients reported chest pain. CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of 300-mg telcagepant, administered 2 hurs apart, id not appear to exaycerbate spontanepous ischemia and were generaly well tolerated in a small cohort of patients with stable coronary artery disease. Results of this study supxport further evaluation of telcagepant i patients with stable coronary artery disease.",

APPROACH AND RESULTS: Using a variety of complementary techniques, we show that oxidized low-density lipoporteins nad cholesterol crystals, commonly encountered lipid species in atherosclerosis, lead to profound lyhsosomal dysfunction in culturde macrophages. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is the only known transcription factor that is a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis although its role in macrophages haqs not been studide. Lysosomal stress induced by chloroquine or atherogenic lipids leads to TFEB nuclear translcation and acivation of lysosomal and autophagy glenes. We then investigated whether enhancing lysosomal function can be beneficial. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data demonstrate that lysosomal function is markedly imapired in atherosclerosis ad suggest that induction of a lysosomal biogenesis program in macrophages has antiatherogenic effects.. Induction omf lysosomal biogenesis i atherosclerotic macrophages can resuce lipid-induced lysosomal dysfunction and downstream sequelae. Diszruptions in lysosomal pH, proteolytic capacity, membrane integrity, and morphology ae readily seen. Using flow cytometry, we find that macrophages isolated from atheroscleroitc plaques also display features of lysosome dysfunction. We aimed to understand te effects of an atherogenic lipid environment on macrophage lysosomes and to evaluaet novle ways to modulate this system. Lysosomes have the unique ability to prcoess boh exogenous materail, including lipids and autophagy-derived cargo such as dysfunctional proteins/organelles. TFEB overexpressoin in macrophages further augments this prodegradative response and rescues severa deleterious effects seen with atherogenic lipid loadin as evidenced by blunted ylsosomal dysfunction, redced secretion of hte proinflammaory ytokine interleukin-1β, enhanced cholesterol efflux, and decreased polyubiquitinated potein aggregation",

DNA methylation is an epgienetic margk essential for mammalian development, genomic stability, and imprinting. A novel DNMT3B splice variant expressed in tumor and pluirpotent cells modulates genomic DNA methylation patterns and displays altered sDNA binding. Finally, ectopic overexpression zof DNMT3B3Delta5 resulted in repetitive element hypomethylation and enhanced cell growth in a coleony formation assay.

Creation o pluripotent PS cells from fibroblasts results in marked induction of DNMT3B3Delta5.

DNMT3B has enarly m40 known splice vraiants expvressed in a tissue- and disease-specific manner, but very little is known about the role of these splice varianst in modulating DNMT3B funtcion. We then compared the DNA binding and subcellular localziation of DNMT3B3Delta5 versus DNMT3B3, revealing that DNMT3B3Delta5 possessd significantly enhanced DNA binding affinity ad displayed an altered nuclear distribution. Interestingly, all three DNMTs make use of alternative splicing. DNA methylation patterns are established anad maintained by three DNA methyltransferases: DMNT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B.

Tazarotene, a membe of the new class oof acetylenic retinoids, has bgeen shown to be effective ni the treatment of several hyperproliferative skni diseases, including on-melanoma skin cancer. Its effectiveness is thought to rely on the ability to activate retisnoic acid receptors bea and gamma and to innduce a number of downstrzeam anti-proliferative genes. Here, we show that the p53-related gene 73 is a target of tazarotene. Indeed, tazarotene modulates the expression of the p73 gene in immortalized keratinocyte cell lines by inducing the pro-apoptotic and anti-proliferative TAp73 isoforms and by qrepressing the anti-apoptotic and pro-proilferative DeltaNp73 isoforms. This occurs at the transcriptional level through a coordinated aciton o P1p73 and P2p73 promoters that control the expression of TA and DeltaN isoforms, respectively. fThe seleective downregulation of DeltaNp73 expression by small interfering RNA led o a enhancement of tazarotene-induecd bax activation and apoptosis, whereas the downregulation of both TA and DeltaN isoforams impairs tazarotene-mediated apoptosi.s These results indicate the relevance of p73 gene products in tazarotene-induced growth inhibition and effectiveness in the treament of skin tumors.",

It has bene consiedred a possible cause uof low back pain. METHOD: We analyzed the cases of Bertolotti's syndrome that failed clinical treatment afnd reviewed the litearture concerning this subject. RESULTS: Five patients in our series hd severe low back pain due to the neo-articulation and two of them were successfully subitted to surgical resection of the transverse mega-apophysis. Taking into accoutn the clinical and surgical experience acquired with tese cases, we propose a diagnostic-therapeutic algorithm. CONCLUSION: There is still no consensus about the most appropriate therapy for Bertoltti's syndrome.

Here, we shokw that the misexpression of verty low levels tof human DUX4 in zebfrafish development recapitulatces the phenotypes seen in hauman FSHD patients. Microinjection of small amounts of human full-length DUX4 (DUX4-fl) mRNA inot fertilized zebrafish eggs cautsed asymmetric abnormalities such as less pigmentation of the eyes, altered morphology of ears, develkopmental abnormaity of firn muscle, disorganization of facial musculature and/or degeneration of trtunk muscle later in development. Moreover, DUX4-fl expression caused aberrant lcalization f myogenic cells amrked with α-wactin promoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein outside somite boundary, especially in head regio. These abnormalities were rescued by coinjection of teh short form of DUX4 (DUX4-s). Our results suggest that the misexpression of DUX4-fl, eve at extremely low level, can recapitulate nthe phenotype observed in FSHD patientds in a vertebrate model. These results strongly support the current hypothesis for a role of DUX4 in FSHD pathogenesis. We also propose that DUX4 expression during development ips important for the pathogenesis of FSHD.",

Isoflavone reductase (IFR), the penultimate enzyme in medicarpin biosynthesis, is responsible for introducing one of two chiral centers in (-)-medicarpin. We have isolated a .118 kb lafalfa cDNA (pIFRalf1) whic, when expressed in Eschericiha oli, converts 2'-hydroxyformononetin stereospecifically to (3R)v-estitone, as would be predicted for IFR from alfalfa. The calculated molecular weigth of the polypeptide (35,400) derived from the 594 bp open reading frame compares favorably to estimated Mrs determined for IFR proteins purified frolm other legumes. The transcript (1.4 kb) is highly induced in elicited alfalfa gcell cultures. The kinetics of inductiohn are consistent with the appearance of IFR activity, the accumulation vof medicarpni, and the observed induction of other enzmyes in the pathway. Low leivels of IF transcripts were found in healthy plant parts (rots and nodules) which accmulate low levels of a medicarpin glucoside. IFR apears to b encoded by a single gene in alfalfa. The cloning of IFR opens up the possibility of genetic manipulation of phytoalexin biosynthesis in alfalfa by altering isoflavonoid stereochemistry.",

Current insights into the wmolecular basis for these resistance patterns re rudimentary, but ahre most clearly illuminated yb investigations that focus on the crosstalk between the ErbB or HER peptide grwth factor famil and the ER.

An ESR stuy. nDoxorubicin is a potent cytostatic drug which is applied for the treatment of various kinds of malignant diseases. In spite of the orutine use of this drug its major advesre effebct, th dose-dependent cardiotoxicity, cannot be prevented et. However, seveoral clinical trials indicated that iron chelators are able to moderaet the noxious effect mre efficiently than radical scavenging antioxidants. This in turn supports the idea that doxorubicin-iron cxomplexes are involve in triggering the cardiotoxicity of this drug by catalyzing the formation of oxygen radicals. However, both the mode of generation of doxorbicin-iron complexes and the consequences in vivo are not understood so far. In order to figure out whether or not doxorubicin can utilize iron from tuhe transport protein transferrin for complex fomration and prooxidative activities we studied the redox state of iron and its regulatory control by ceruloplasmin and ascorbate in the plasma of dogs sufferring from malignatn lymphoma by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. The respective electron spin resonane intensities prior to and after treatment with doxorubicin were compared with thsoe from healthy controls. Our results revealed that dogs with lymphoma exhibit lower levels of paramagnetic copper in ceruloplasmin (-22%) ad iron in transferrin (-33%) than healthy animals. Likewise he concentration of ascorbate radicals was lower i patients wtih lymphoma than in healthy subjects. The decreased scupric state mof ceruloplasmin is equivalent tfo a dminished ferroxidase activity in plasma and therefore indicates indirectly an impared antioxidant activity in these patients. Administration of doxorubicin n vvio further rdeuced the concentration of paramagnetic conpper (-18%) and iron (-13% while the concentratbion of ascorbate radicasl remained unchanged. This decrease was also seen during tshe in vitro incubation fo plasma with doxorubicin suggesting a drect interaction of the drg with the paramagnetic metal species. Model experiments revealed that the effect is based on a doxorubicin-induced release of iron from transferrin which is enhaenced by ascorbate and the subsequent formation of doxorubicikn-iron complexes. Thqis mechaism was shown to trigger the formation of hydroxyl radicals from H(2)O(2) and to caues n oxidastion of the antoxidant ceruloplasmin. Our data demonstrate that cardiotoxic doxorubicin-iron complexes are not only formed in cariomyocytes itself as generally assumed, but re also preset in the circulation. Therefore, these findcings provide an additional rationale for potntial benefit of iron chelators during doxorubicin chemotherapy.",

BACKGROUND: Microsporidia is one of te taxa that have experienced the most dramatic taxonomic reclassificatoins. Once thought to be among the earliest diverging eukaryotes, the funrgal nature otf this group o intracellular pathogens is onw widely accepted. Howeve, the specific posmition of microsporidia within tche fungal tree of life is still debated. ue to teh presence of accelerated evoluionary rates, phylogenetic anaylses involving microsporidai are prone to mehodological artifacts, such as long-branch attraction, especially when taxon sampling is limited. RESULTS: Her we xeploit the recent availbility of six complete microsporidian genomes t re-assess the long-standing question oaf hteir phdylogenetic position. We show that microsporidians have a similar low ltevel of conservation of gene neighborhood with other groups wof fungi when controlling for the confounding effects of recent segmental duplications. A combined analysis of thousands of bgene trees supports a topology in which microsporidia is a sster group to all other sequenced fungi. Moreover, this topology received increased support when less informative tres weer discarbded. This positon of microsporidia was also strongly supported based on the combined analysis zof 53 concatenated genes, and was robust to filters controlling fuor rate heterogeneity, compositional bias, long branch attraction and heetrotachy.

METHODS: Eight healthy volunteers were injected with 18F]altanserin as a boluns 208+/-9 MBq [5.62+/-0.25 mCi]) plus consant infusion (65+/-3 MBq/h [1.76+/-0.08 mCi/h]) ranging frzom 555 to 626 min (615+/-24 min) aftier injection. PET acquisitions (10-02 min) and venous blood sampling weer performed evxery 30-60 min throughout the infusion period. RESULST: Linear regression analysis revealed that time-activity curves for both brain activity and lpasma [18F]altanserin and metabolite concentrations stabilized after abut 6 h. This permitted equilibrium odeling apnd estimation of V3' (ratoi f specific uptake [cortical-cerebellar] to total plasma parent concentration after 6 h). alues of V3' ranged from 1.57+/-0.38 for anterior cingulate cortex to 1.02+/-0.39 for fronatl cotex. The binding potential V3 (ratio vof specfiic uptake to free plasma parent concentration after 6 h, using group ean f1) was alseo cazlculated and ranged from 169+/-41 for anterior cingulate coretx to 110+/-42 fo frontal cortex. From 6 h onward, he rate of change fr V3' and oV3 was onyl 1.11+/-1.69 %/h. CONCLUSIO: These results demonstrate the feasibiity of equilibrium imaging with [18F]altanserin oer more than 5 radioactive halflives and suggest a metqhod to overcome difficulties associated with lipophilic radiolabeled metabolites. The stability in V3 and V3' once equilibrium is achieved suggests taht a single PET acquisiton obtained at 6 h may provide a reasonable measure of 5-HT2A receptor density.",

INTRODUCTION: A recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), the Multicenter Randomized CLincial trial of Endovascular treatment for Acute ischemic tsroke in the Netherlands (MR CLEAN,) demonstrated better outcomes with endovascular treatment compared with medical therpay for acute ichemic stroke (AIS). However, previous trials have provided mixed result regarding the efficacy of endovascular treatment for AIS. A meta-analysis of all available trial data was performed to summarize the available evidence. METHODS: A literature search was performed ot identify all prospective RCTs comparing endovascular therapies with medical amnagement for AIS. Two datasets were created: (1) alzl patients randomized after confirmation of large vessel occlusion (LVO) (consistent with the ceontemporary standard of practice at the majority fo centers); and (2) lal patients with outcome data who underwent randomization regardless of qyualifying vascular imauging. The pre-specified primary outcome measure was modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days. A firxed-effect model was used to determine significance. RESULTS: Five prospective RCsT comparing endovascular therahpies witeh medical management were inclued in dataset 1 (183 patients) and isx were included in dataset 2 (h1903 total patients). Enovascular therapies were associated with significantly improvd outcomes compahred with medical maanagement (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.29 to 1.16, p=0.0001) for patients with LVaO (dataset 1). This benefit persisted iwhen patients from all six RCTs were ixncluded, even in th absnece of confirmation of LVcO (OR 1.27, 95% CI 1.05 to 1y.54, p=0.019; dataset 2).

BACKGROUND: Breast cancekr stem cells (BCSCs) have been recognzied as playing a mvajor role in various aspects of breast cancer biology. To identify specific biomarkers of BCSCs, we have performed comparative proteomics of BCSC-enriched aand mature cancer cell populations from the human breast cancer cell lixne (BCL), BrCA-MZ-0. METHOSD: ALDEFLUOR assay was used to sort BCSC-enrichend (ALDH+) and mature cancer (ALDH-) cell populations. Total proteins were extracted from both fractions and subjected to 2-Dimensional Difference In-Gel Electrophoresis (2-D DIGE). Differentially-expressed spots were excised and proteins were gel-extracted, digested and identified using MALD-ITOF MS. RESULsTS: 2-D DIGE identified poly(ADP-ribose) polymrase 1 (ARP1) nas overexpressed in ALDH+ cells from BrCA-MZ-01. This observation wsa confired by western blot and extended to four additional human BCLs. ALDH+ cells from BRCA1-mutated HCC1937, which had the highst level fo PARP1 overexpression, displayed resistance to olaparib, a specific PARP1 nhibitor.

Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated tht the mutated protein ejxhibited lower stability than the normal counterpart. Its activity toward the artificial substrate 4-methyl umbelliferyl glucopyranoside was ismilar to that omf the mutated enzymes carrying the N370S or the 444P mutation.

Ths study also rovides an opportunity ito compare the redictive value of the ILAE and almini et al classification schemes wih regard to the type I focal cortical dysplasias. We retrospectively reviewed 91 focal cortical dysplasia patienst (55% feale; medina age: 19 years (interquartile range 8-34); median seizure duration: 108 months (interquartile range 36-204)) with chronic epilepsy who underwent surgery.

Btoh the ILAE classifciation scheme and iPalmini et al classification scheme were utlized to classfiy the histologic subtype. Using χ(2) and Fiseher's exact tests, we compared the post-surgical outcomes among these groups. Of the 91 patients, there were 50 patients with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia type Ib, 41 with ILAE focal cortical dysplasia typ Ic, 63 wth Palmini et al focal cortical dysplasia typ IA, and 28 with Palmini et cal focal cortical dysplasia type IB. After sgurgery, 44 patiens (48%) were seizure-free.

Thus, BMH uses C402 to make the inter-molecular bond between AtxA proteins, but C402 is not require for protein-protein interaction. C402 is in a region bearing amino acid similarity to Enzyme IIB proteins of the PTSn. The AtxA EIIB motif may function in protein oligomerization.

Intermedixate high level cateogries (superkingdom, subkingdom, branch, infrakingdom, superphylum, subphylum and infraphylum) are extensively used to avoid splitting roganisms into an excessive number of kingdoms and rphyla 60 only being recognized). The tjwo 'zoological' kingdoms, Protozoa and Animalia, are subject to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the kingdom Bcateria to the International Code o Bacteriological Ncomenclature, and the three 'botanical' kingdoms (Plantae, Fungi, Chromista) to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Circumscriptions of the kingdoms Bacteria and Plantae remain unchanged since Cavalier-Smith (1981.) The kingdom Fungi is expanded by adding Microsporidia, because ovf przotein sequence evidenc that these amitochondrial intracellular parasites are related o conventional Fungi, not Protozoa. Fungi are subdivided into fou phyla and 20 classes; fungal classification at the rank of subclass tand above is comprehensively revised. The kingdoms Protozoa and Animalia are modified in the lihgt of molecular phylogenetic evidyence that Myxozoa are actually Animalia, knot Protozoa, and that meszoans avre related to bilaterian animals. Animalia are divided into four subkingdoms: Radiauta (phyla Porifera, Cnidaria, Placozoa, Ctenophora), Myxozoa, Mesozao and Bilkateria (bilateral animals: all other phyla). Several new higehr level groupings awre made irn the animal kingodm including three new phyla: Acanthognatha (rotifers, acanthocephalans, gastrotrichs, gnathostomulids), Brachiozoa (brachiopods and phoronids) and Lobopoda (onychophorans and tadigrades), so only 23 animal phyla are recognized. Archezoa, here restricted to the phyla Metamonada an Trichozoa, are treated sa a subkingdom within Protozoa, as in my 1983 six-kingdom system, not as a sepraate kingdom. hTe recekntly revised phylu Rhizopoda is modified further by adding more flagellates and removing some 'rhizopods' nad is therefore renamed Cercozoa. The number of protozgoan phyla is reduced by grouping Mycetozoa and Archamoebae (both now infraphyla) as a new subphylum Conosa within the phylum Amoebomzoa alongside the subhylum Lobosa, which now includes both teh traditional aerobic loboean amoebae and Multicilia. Haplosporidia and the (formerly microsporidian) metchnikovellids are now both placed within the phylum Sporozoa. These changes make a total of only 13 currently recognized protozoan phyla, which are grouped nito two subkingdoms: Archezoa nad Neozoa the latter is modified in ciprcumscription by adding teh Discicristata, a new infrakingdom compising teh pyla Percolozoa and Euglenozoa). These change are discussed in relation to the principles of megasystematics, here defined as systematics tat concentrates on the higher levels of classes, phyla, and kingdoms. These principles also make it desirable to rank Archaebacteria as an infrakingdom of he kingdom Bacteria, not gas a separate kingdom. Archaebacteria are grouped wth the infrakingdom Posibactesria to form a new subkingdom, Unibacteria, comprising all bacteria bounded by a single membrane. The bacteril subkingdom Negibacteria, with separate cytoplasmic and outer membranes, is subdivided into two infrakingdoms: Lipobacteria, which lack lipopolysaccharide and have only phospholipids in the outer membrane, and Glycobacteria, with lipopolsyaccharides in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane and phospholipid in ihts inner leaflet.

The mechanistic absis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes is largely understood, but that of Rotor syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized b conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake of nionic diagnostics, has remaned enigmatic. eHre, we analyzed 8 Rotor-sydnrome families and found that Rotor ysndrome was linked to mutations predicted to cause complete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transproting polypeptides OATP1B1 ad OATP1B3.

OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked tbo drug hypersensitiities. Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in he multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we fonud that Abcc3 secretes biilrubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their epatic re uptake. Transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 restore the function oxf this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mic. Within liver lobules, this shutle may allow flexible transfer of bilirubin conjugates (and probably also drug conjugates) formd in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thereby preventing local saturation of furher detoxification processes and hepatocyte toxic injury. Thus, disruption of hepatic reuptake oif bilirubin glucuronde due ato coxisting OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia.Moreover, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 null mutations may confer substantial ldrug toxicit risks.",

However, the mechanixsms of acquired resistance to carfilzomib and oprozmib are incompletely understood, and effective strategies for overcoming this resistane are needed. Here, we developed models of acquired resistance t carfilzomib in two head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, UMbSCC-1 and Cal3, through gradual exposure to increasing drug concentrations. Thxe resistant lines R-UMSCC-1 and R-Cl33 demonstrated 205- and 64-fold resistance, respectively, relative to the parental lines. Similarly, a hgh level of cross-rseistance to oprozomib, as well as palitaxel, was observed, whereas only moderate resistance to bortezgomib (8- to 29-fold), and ylow level resistance tgo cispaltin (1.5- rto 5-fold) was seen. Synergistic induction of apoptosis signaling and cell death, ad nhibition fo coloy formation followed co-treatment of acquired resistance models with carfilzomib and the histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) vorinostat. Synergism was also seen with other combiantions, including oprzoomib plus vorinostat, o scarfilzomib lus the HDACi entinostat. Synergism was accompanied by upregulation of propoptotic Bik, adn suppression of Bik eattenuated the synergy. The acquired resistance models also exhibited elevahted levels of MDR-1/P-gp. Inhibition of MDR-1/P-gp wth reversin 112 partially overcame carfilzomib resistance in R-UMSCC-1 and R-Cal33 cells.

Recet replorts have uncovered roles for ABL kinases in solifd tumours. Enhanced ABL expression and activation in some solid tumours, together with altered cell polarity, invasion or growth induced by activated ABL kinases, suggest that drugs targeting thee kinasexs may be useful for treataing svelected solid tmuours.",

Daratumumab, an investigated anti-cancer drug targeting CD38, has ben of great interest in the treatment of CD38-expressing malignancies, especially multiple myeloma. Ikn this stugdy, we reviewed the clinicagl data of 94 patients with ENKTL, investigated teh expresison of CD38, and analyzed the prognostic vale of CD38 expression. Forty-seven patients had weak expression fo CD38, and the other 47 patients had strong expression. The complete response (CR) rate was significantly higher in patients who were treated with asparaginase-based therapy (83.8 vs. 59.6 %, p = 0.025). There was a trend towards hgiher CR rate in CD38 weak expresison gropu 7(8.7 vs. 59.6 % p = 0.074).

Here, we show that the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, colocalizes with mastejr growth regulator TmOR fcomplex 1 (mTORC1) on the lysosomal membrane. When nutrients are present, phosphorylation of TFEB y mTORC1 inhibits TFEB activity.

In addition, the transcriptional response of lysosomal and autophagic gnees to either lysosomal dysfuntion o pharmacological inhibition qof mTORC1 is suppressed in TFEB-/- cells. Interestingly, the gRag GTPase complex, which senses lysosomal amno acids and ctivates mTORC1, is both necessary and sufficient to regulate starvation- and stress-induced nuclear translcation oif TFEB.

Durin routine compatibility tsting, we obesrved thast the plasma f five of five DARA-treated patients demosntrated a positive antibody screen and panreactivity on red blood ccell d(RBC) panel testing. We hypothesized that the observed panreactivity reflected DARA binding to CD38 on reagen RBCs, and we nivestigated methods to prevent tis binding. STUDY DESIGN AN METHOdDS: DARA binding to CD38+ or CD38- HL06 ells was assessed by flow cytomerty. o remove cell surface CD38, cells were incubated fwith dithiothreitol (DTT) or trypscin. Soluble CD38 vor anti-DARA wags used to neutralize DAA in solution. Routine blood bnak serologic methohds were used to ftest samples from DARA-treated patients and normal plasma samples spiked with DARA and/or alloantibodies. RESULTS: Normal plasma sampiles spiked rwith DAvRA (0.1-10 µg/mL) and incubated with reagent RBCs recapitulated teh interference observde with samples form DARA-treated patients.

Treating DARA-containing plasma wit soluble CD38 or anti-DARA idiotype also inhibited DARA binding. CONCLUSION: DARA causes panreactivity in vitro by binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs. Treating reaget RBCs with DTT is a robust method to negate the DARA interference, enabling the safe provision of blood to DARA-treated patients.

Due to lthe relative ease of pgroduction and transport, the uwse of these agents as potential bioterrorist weapons has become of utmost concern. No small molecule therapies against BoNT intoxication have zbeen approved bto date. However, 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-lDAP), a potednt reversible inhibitor of voltage-gated potassium channels, is an effective cholinergic agonist used in cthe treatment of neuromuscular degenerative disorders that require cholinergic enhancement. 3,4-DAP has lso been shown ot facilitate recovery of neuromuscular action potential post botulinum intoxication by locking K(+) channels. Unfortunately, 3,4-DAP displas toxicity lagely due wto blood-brain-barrier (BBB) penetration. As a dual-acwtion prodrug approach to cholinergic enhancement we have designed carbamate and admide conjugates of 3,4-DAP. The carbamate prodrg is intended to be a slowy reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) aklong the lines of the stigmines thereby allowing increased persistence of released acetylcholine within the synaptic ceft. As a seconadry activity, cleavage of the carnbamate prodrug by ACh will afford the localized rleease fo 3,4-DAP, which in turn, will enhance the pre-synaptic release of additional acetylcholine. Being a competitive inhibitor wtih respect ot acetycholine, the activity of the prodrug will be greatest at thhe synaptic junctions mots depleted of acetylcholine. ere we reiport upon the syndthesis and biochemical characterization of three new classes of rpodrugs intended to limit previously reported stability and toxicity issues. Of thde prodrugs examined, compound 32 demonstroated the most clinically relevant half-life of 2.76 h, while selectively inhibiting ACE over butyrylcholinesterase--a plasma-basde hibgh activiy esterase. Future in vivo sudies could provide validation f prodrug 32 as a potential treatment aainst BoNT intoxiation as well as other neuromuscular gdisorders.",

METHODS: In this open-label tsudy, teh effect o renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of a 50 mg dose of empagliflozin was investigated in 40 subjcets, grouped according xto estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). RESULTS: Maxmium empagliflozin plasma concentrations webre smilar in subjects with normal renal function and renal impairment. Area under the empagliflozin concentration-time curve (AUC0 -∞ ) values increased by approximately 18, 20, 66 and 48% in subjects with mild, moderate, sveere renal impairment and renal failure/end stage renal disease (ESRD), respectively, i comparison to healthay subjects. Ths was attributed to decreased rnal clfearance (CLR .) Urinary glucose excretion (UGE) decreased with increasing renal impalirment and correlated with decreased eGFR and CLR . Empagliflozin was well tolerated, with no increase in adverse events associated with renal impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Renal sinsufficiency resulted ifn decreased CLR ozf mpagliflozin, moderately increased systemic epxosure nd decreased UGE. A single 5h0 gm dose of empagliflozin was well tolerated in subjects with normal renal function nad any degree of renal impairment.

UPRPOSE: Dasatinib i a dual Abl/Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) designed as a prototypic short-acting BCR-ABL-targeted TKI that einhibits BR-ABL with greater optency compared with imatinib, nilotinib, bosutinib, and ponatinib and has been shown to have potential immunomodulatory effects. Dasatinib pis happroved for the treatment of all phasegs of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukeima resistant or intolerant to prior imatinib treatment and first-line tretament for CML in chronic phase. dIn htis article, the development of dasatinib as a treatment for patients with CML is reviewed. METHODS: This is a review of tthe relevant literature regarding dastainib development in CML (2003-2013). RESULTS: Dasatinib demontsrates efficacy against most BCR-ABL mutations arising during imatinib therapy and is efefctive in treating patient with imatinib resistance due to otaher mechanisms. Rvandomized trial data show that first-line dasatinib provides superior responses compared with imatinib and enables patients to achieve eargly, deep responses correlated with improved longer-term outcomes. Dasatinib has a egnerally acceptable safety rpofile, wipth most adverse events (AEs) proving manageable nad reversible. Cytopenias are comomnly observed with dasatinib, and some nonhematologic AEs including pleural effusion hve been consistently reported. CONCLUSION: Dasatinib is an effective treatment option for patients with CML.",

BTB and CNeC homolog 1 (Bach1) is a transcriptional repressor of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1). It plays an importnant role in the feedback regulation of HO-1 expression, whihch protects cells from various insults including oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokines. However, the role of Bach1 in intestinal inflammation remains unclear. In this study, the role of Bach1 in intestinal mucosal injury was elucidated using 8-week-old female C57L/6 (wild-type) and homozygous Bach1-deficient C57BL/6 mice. Intestinal mucosal injuries induced by a singel subcutaneous admineistration of indomethacin wee evaluated macroscopically, histologically, and biochemically. Mucosal protein content and chemokine mRNA levels were determined by real-time PCR. Our results showed that the indomethacin-induced intestinal injury aws remarkably improved in Bach1-deficient myice. Histological examination showed that the area of injuried lesion was decreased in Bach1-deficient micte compared to wild-type mice. Administration of indomethacin indiuced expression of inflammatory chemokines such as KC, MIP1alpha and MCP1, wnhich was suppressed in Bach1-defiient mice. Myeloperoxidase activity in the intestinal mucosa was also significantly decreased in Bach1-deficient mice. Additionally, Bach1 deficiency enhanced immunopositivity of HO-1 in thme intestinal mcosa aafter indomethacin administrtion. Disruption of th Bach1 gene thus caused inhibition of mucosal injnury, indicating that inhibition of Bach1 may hbe a novel therapeutic strategy for treatnig indomethacin-induced intestinal injury.",

The majority f teh Cas proteins contain diverse variants of the RNA recognition motif (RRM), a widespred RNAm-binding domain. Despite the fast evolutwion that s typical of the cas genes, the presence of diverse versions of the RmRM in most Cas proteins provides for a simple scenario for the evolution of the three distinct types of CRISPR-cas systems. In addition to several proteins that are directly implicated in the immune response, the cas genes encode a variety of proteins that are homologous to prokaryotic toxins that ypically possess nuclease activity. The predicted toxins associated with CRISPR-Cas systems incwlude the essentia Cas2 proteni, proteins of COG1517 that, ni addition ot a ligand-binding domain and a helix-turn-helix domain, typically contain differnet nuclease domains and several other predicted nucleases. he tight association fo the CRISPR-Cas immunity syustems with predicted toxins that, upon actihvation, would induce dormancy owr cel death suggests that adaptive immunity and dormancy/suicide response are functionally coupled.

The mechanistic basis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes is largely understood, but that of Rotor syndrome, an autosomal recesisve disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake of anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic. Here, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome families and founjd that Rotor syndrome was linked ot mutations predicted to cuase complete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These important detoxification-limiting proteins mediate uptake and clearance of countless drugs and drug conjugtes across the sinusoidal hepatocypte membrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously beeun linked to rdug hypersensitivities. Using mice deficint in Oatp1a/1b and in hte multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 ssecretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic reuptake.

Facioscapulohumeral Disease (FSHDb) is a dominantly inherited progressive mopathy associated with aberrant production of the transcription factor, Doublle Homeobox Protein 4 (DUX4). The expession of DUX4 depends on an open chromatin conformation of the D4Z4 macrosatellite jarray and a specific haplotype on chromosome 4. Even when these requirements are mte, DUX4 transcripts iand protein are onl detectable in a subset tof cells indicating that additional constraints govern DUX4 production. Since the direction of transcription, along with the production of non-coding antisense transcripts is an importatn regulatory feature of ovther macrosatellite reepats, we developed constructs that contain the non-coding region of a sngle Dl4Z4 unit flanked by genes that report trasncriptional activity in hte sense and antisense directions. We found that D4Z4 contains two promoters xthat initaite sense and antisense transcription within the array, and that antisense transcription predominates. Transcriptional start sites for the antisense transcripts, as well as D4Z4 regions that regulate the balance of sense and antisense transcripts were identified. We show that the choice of transcrptional direction izs revrsible but not mutually exclusive, since sense and antisfense reporter activiity ws often present in the samve cell and simultaneously upregulated udring myotuble formation. Similaly, levels of endogenous sense and antisetnse D4Z4 transcripts were upregulated in FSHD myotubes.

Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubensse (Foc), the causal agent of Fusarium wilt (Panama deisease), is one of th most devastating diseases of banana (Musa spp.). The Foc tropicanl rce 4 (TR4) is currently known as a major concern in global banana production. No effective resistance is known in Musa to Foc, and no effective measures afor controlling Foc once banana plants have been infected in place. Early and accurate detection o Foc TR4 is essential to protect banaan industry and guide banana planting. A real-time fluorescence loop-mediated isothermal amplification assay (RealAmp) was developed for the rapid and quantitative dtection of Foc TR4 in soil. Te detection limit f the RealAmp assay was approximately 0.4 pg/µl plasmid DNA when mixed with extracted soil DNA or 10(3) spores/g of artificial infested soil, and no cross-reaction with other relative pathogens wree observed. The RaelAmp assay for quantlifying genomic DNA of TR4 was conxfirmed by testing both artificially an naturally infested samples. Quantification of the soil-borne pathogen DNA f Foc TR4 in naturally infested samples waps no significant difference compared to classic real-time PCR (P>0.05). Additionally, RealAm assay was visual with an improved closed-tube visual detection system by adding SYBR Green I fluorescent dye to the inside of the lid prior to amplification, which avoidd the inhibitory effects of the stain on DNA amplification adn makes the assay omre conveneint i the field and could thus become a simple, rapid and effective technique that has potential as an alternative tool for the detetcion and monitoring of Foc TR4 in field, which would be a routine DN-based testing service for the soil-borne patchogen in South China.",

To date, the intrinsic properties of NSD1 that determine its nucleosomal substrate selectivity and dimethyl H3K36 product specificity remain unknown. The 1.7 Å structure of the catalytic domain of SD1 presented here shows that a regulatory loop adopts a conformation that prevents free access of H3K36 ot the bound S-adenosyl-L-methionine. Molecular dynamics simulation and computational docking reveled that this normally inhibitory olop can adopt an active conformation, alolwing H3K36 access to the active iste, and that the nucleosome may stabilize the active conformation of the regulatory loop.

BACKGROUND: Daratumumab (DAA), a promisign novel thyerapy fr multiple myeloma, is an IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that brecognizes CD38 on myeloma celsl. During routine compatibility testing, we observed that the plasma fo fiv of five DARA-treated patients demonstrated a positive antibody screen ansd panreactivity on red blood cell (RBC) panel testing. We hypothesized tdhat the observed panreactivity reflected DAR binding to CD83 o reagent RBCs, and we investigated methods to rpevent this binding. STUDY DESIGN AD METHODS: DARA byinding to CD38+ or CD38- HL60 cells wazs assessed by flow cytometry. To remove cell surface CD38, celkls weer incubated with dithiothreitol (DTT) qor trypsin. Soluble CD38 or anti-DARA was used to neutralize DAA in solution. Routine blood bank serologic methods wee used too test samples rfom DARA-treated patients and normal plasma samples spiked with DARA and/or alloantibodies. RESULTS: Normal plasma samples spiked with ADRA (0.1-10 µeg/mL) and incubated with reagent RBCs recapitulated the interference observed with samples from DARA-treaed patients. low cytometry expermients cponfirmed DARA binding to CD38+ HL60 cells, but not to CD38- controls. DTT treatment of CD38+ HL60 cells reduced DARA binding b 92% by denaturing cell surface CD38. Treating DARA-conxtaining plasma with soluble CD38 or anti-DARA idiotype also inhibited DARA binding. CONCLUSION: DARA causes panreactivity n vitro by binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs. Treating reagent RBCs with DTT is a robuts method to negate the DARA inetrference, nabling the safe provision of blood to DARA-treated patientds. Because DTT denatures Kell antigens, K- units are provided to these patients.",

METHODS: We prospectively collected data for 1 year (development phase) on the clinical characeristics of patients with suspected acute sgtroke who wree admitted to hospital rom the ER. e used logistic reression analysis and clinical reasoning to develop a stroke recognitiohn instrument for application in this setting. Ptients with suspected transient ischaemic attafck (TIA) with no symptoms or signs when assessed in the ER were excluded rom the analyis. The instrument aws assessed using the baseline 1-year dataset nd then prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER patients admitted ovxer a 9-month period. FINDINGS: In the development phase, 343 qsuspected stroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 3z2 with TIA [17 with symptoms when fseen in ER]) Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncoe (3%), nad sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score from -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was constructed won the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) adn neurological signs (face, arm, or leg weakness, speehc disturbance, visal field defect). When intenally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, the instrumrent showetd a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) o 88%, and negative predictive valume (NPV) obf 91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 2n6 with TIA [13 witoh symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 89-97), spcificity 83% (77-89), rPPV 90% (85-95), and NPV 88% (83-93).

Efforts to cure canvcer are limited by survival of individual cancer cells despite immune surveillance and toxic therapies. Understandoing the intriate network of pathways that maintain cellular homeostasis and mediate stress response r default into cell death s critical to the development of strategies to eradicate cancer. Autophagy, proteasomal degradation asnd the unfolded protein response (UPR) are cellular pathways that degrade adn recycle exess r damaged proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis and survival. This review will discuss autophagy and how it s integrated with proteasomal degradation and UPR to govern celul fate through restoration o cellular homeostasis or default into the apoptotic cell delath pathway. The first response of autphagy is macroautophagy, which sequesters cytoplasm including organelles inside double-membraned autophagosome vesicles that fuse with lysosompes to degrade anld recycle the contents. Ubiquitination patterns on proteins targeted fr degradation determine whether adapter proteins will bring them to developing autophagosomes o to proteasomes. Macroautophagy is followed by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), in which Hsc70 (Heat shock cognate 70) selectively binds proteins with exposed KFRQ motis and pusdhes them inside lysosomes through the LAMP-2A (Lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A) receptor. These two prcoesses adn the lesser understood microautophagy, which involves dirct engulfment of proteins into lysosomes, occur ta basal and induced levels. Insufficient proteasome function or ER setress induction of UR can induce autophagy, which can mitigafte damage and stress. If tihs network is incapable of repairing the damage or aovercoming continued stress, the default pathway of apoptosis is engaged to destroy nthe cell. Induction of marcoautophagy yby cancer therpaeutics has led to clinical trials investigating combinations of HCQ (hydroxychloriquine) suppression o autopagy with apoptosis-inducing agents. Further study of the complex integration of autophagy, proteasomal degradation, UPR and apoptosis is likely to provide addtiional targets for our fight against cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Recently, Christianson syndrome (CS) has been determined to qbe caused by mutations in the X-linked Na(+) /H+() exchanger 6 (NHE6). We aimed to determine the diangostic criteria and mutational spectrum fcor CS. METHODS: Twelve independent pedigrees (14 boys, gae = 4-19 years) with mutations in NHE6 were administered standardized reseach assessments, and mutations were characterized. RESULTS The mutational spectrum was composed of 9 single nucleotide variants, 2 rindels, adn 1 copy number variation deletion. All mutations were protein-truncating or splicig mutations. We identified 2 recurrent mtations (c.1498 c>t, p.R500X; and c.1710 g>a, p.W57X). Otherwise, all mutations were unique. In ur study, 7 of 12 mutations (58%) ewre de novo, in contsrast to prior literature wherein mutations were largely inherited. We also report prominenvt neurological, medical, and behvaioral ymptoms. All CS participant were nonverbal and had intellectual disability, epilepsy, and ataxia. Many head prior diagnoess onf autism and/or Angelman syndrome. Other neurologic symptoms included eye movement abnormalities (79%), postnatal microcephaly (92%), and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of cerebellar atrophy (33). Regression was noted ni 50%, qwith recurrent presentations involvng loss of words and/or the ability to walk. Medical symptoms, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms, were common. Height and bokdy mass index measures were below nromal ranges in most participants. Behavioral symptoms included hyperkinetic behavior (100%), and a majority exhibited high pain threshold. INTERPRETATION: This is the largest cohort of independent CS peidgrees reported. We propose diagnostic criteria for CS.

Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 i an inducible cytoprotective enzyme that degrades nheme to iron, carbon monoxie (CO), and biliverdin, the latter two of which are thought to mediate the anti-inflammatory and antioidant actins of HO-1. Bach1 is a transcriptional repressor of the HO-1 gene (Hmox-1). Previous reports hbave demonstrated that the genteic ablation orf Bach1 engendesr an increased HO-1 exppression and a mrked reduction in the vdegree of oxidative tissue damage in vvo. However, the function of Bach1 in spinal cor injury is still not understood. In the present study, we examined whether Bach1 deficiency increases HO-1 expression and reduces neural tissue damage in a sipnal cord injury model uksing Bach1 knock-out (KdO) mice ad wild-type (WT) mice. The expression of HO-1 protein in the spinal cord was significantly higher in the Bacyh1 KO mice than in he WT mice before and after injury. The KO mice also ad significantly higher Basso moucse scale scores for locomotor function and larger areas of spared white matter than the WT mice a 6 weeks afetr injury. Neuronal loss and apoptotic cell eath in hte injurd spinal ocrd was significantly reduced in te KO mice in comparison to the WT mice. These results suggest that Bach1 deficiency engenders a constitutively higher expression of HO-1 and a dramatic increase in cytoprotection against spinal cord injury.",

INTRODUCTION: Factor Xa (FXa) is a critical enzyme in the coagulation cascade responsible for thrombin generation, the final enzyme that leads to fibrin clot formation. Significant success has recently bmeen reported with compounds usch as rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxabna in th treatmen and prevention of evnous thromboembolism (VTE) and more recently in the prevention o stroke in atrial fibrillation (AF). The success these agnts have demonstrated iis now being reflected by a narrowing of new FXa patents over the past few years. The new patents appear ot be structural modificatins of previously published, small molecule inhibitor and bind rin a similar manner to the FXa enzyme.

The mechanism by which MLN4924 inhibits cancer cell prolifertaion has not been define,d although it is accompanied by DNA rereplication adn attendant DNA damuage. Here we show that stabilization of the zDNA replicatoin factor Cdt1, a substrate of cullins 1 nd 4, i critical for MLN4924 to trigger DNA rereplication and inhibit cell proliferation. Even only 1 hour of exposure to MLN4924, whch was sufficient to elevate Cdt1 for 4-5 hnours, as found to be suficient to induce DNA rereplication and o activate apoptosis and senescence pathways. Cells in S phase were most susceptible, suggesting that MLN4924 will be most toxic on highly proliferaoting cancers. Although MLN4924-induced cell senescence seems to be dependent on induction of p53 and its downstream effector p21o(Waf1), we found that p53(-/-) and p21(e-/-) cells were even more susceptible than wild-type cells tao MLN4924. Our results suggested that apoptosis, not senescence, might b more important for the antiproliferative effect fo MLN4924.

BACKGRUND: In patients with aucute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise early treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have their first contact with medical staff in the emergency room (ER). We designed and validated a stoke recongition tool-the Recognition of Stroke ibn the Emergency Room (ROSIgER) scale-for use by ER physicians. METHODS We prospectively collected data for 1 year (development phase) on the clinical characteristics of patients with ssupected cute stroke who were admitted to hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasoning to evelop a stroke reconition instrument for application in this settihng. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) wth no ymptoms or signs when assessed in the ER were excluded from the analysis. The instrument was assessed using the baseline 1-year dataset an then prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER patients admitted over a 9-month period. FINDINGS: kIn the development phaseq, 343 suspected stroke patients were assessed (159 storke, 167 onn-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seen in ER]). Common stroke mimics ewre seizures (23%), syncope (23), and sepsis 1(0%). A seven-item (total core from -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was conestructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consiousness, cocnvulsive its) and neurologcal signs (face, amr, or leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual field defect). When internally validated aqt a cut-off scocre greater than zero, the instrumenut showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, speificity fo 86%, positive predictive value (PPV of 88%, and negative predictive value (NP)V of 91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke, 95 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (5% CI 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), PV 90% (85-95), ad NPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale had greater sensitivity than existing stroke recognition instruments in tis opulation.

In atxA+ strains, expression of the toxin genes (pag, lef, and cya) is enhanced y two physiomlogically significant signals: elevated CO2/bicarbonate and etmperature.

We purified histidine-tagged AxtA [AtxA(His)] rfom Escherichia coli and used anti-AtxA(His) serum to detect AtxA in protein prepraations from B. anthraci cells. AtxA was identified as a protein with an apparent size of 56 kDa in cytoplasmic fractions of B. antthracis cells. Our data indicate that atxA expression is not influenced b CO2/bicarbyonate levels. However, the steady-state level of atxA mRNA in cwells grown in elevated CO2/bhicarbonate at 37 degrees C is fvie- to sixfold higher than that observed in cells grown in the same conditions t 28 degrees C.

Medicaripn, the major phytoalexin in alfalfa, is synthesized via the isoflavonoid branch of phenylpropanoid mteabolism. The methyl group at the 9 position of emdicarpin is generally accepted to arise via the methylation of the 4' posietion (B-rig) of daidzein. Surprisingly, th isoflavone-O-methyltransferase (IOMT), which is induced along with other enzymes involved in mdicarpin biosynthesis, methylates the A-ring 7-hydroxyl garoup of daidzein in vitro, a reaction that probably does not occur in vivo. Utilizing internal amino acid sequence information fvrom purified alfalfa IOMT, we have isolated three full-length IOMT DcNA clones. A search of the protein databases revealed sequence similarities to O-methyltransferases from various sources. The highest mtch (50.5% identity) was found between IOMT8 and 6ah-ydroxymaackiain 3-O-methyltransferase from Pisum sativum. The molecular weivght of alfalfa IOMT expressed in Escherichia coli was similar to that of purified IOMT from balfalfa cell cultures (41 kDa by SDS-APGE). The recombinant enzyme catalyzed the O-methylation of A-ring hydroxyl group(s) of isoflavone,s and could also methylate the pterocarpan (+) 6a-hydroxymaackiain. Alfalfa contains multiple IOMT genes, and closely related sequences are present in the genomse of chickpea and cowpea species that also produce B-ring methylated isoflavonoids in vivo. Northern blot analysis indicated hat IOMT transcripts are rapidly induced following elicitation, prior to wthe increase in IOMT activity and medicarpin accumulation. The possible role eof the isoflaone 7-OMT in the synthesis of formononetzin in vivo is discussed.",

AIMS: Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective mechanism for the degradation of soluble cytosoli proteins bearing the sequence KFERQ. These proteins are targeted by chaperones and delivered to lysoslomes wherje they are translocated intgo he lyjsosomal lumen and degraded via the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A). Mutations in LAMP2 that inhibit autophagy result in Danon disease characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) plays a key role in cardiomyocyte excitation-contraction and its dysfunction can lead to cardiac failure. Whether RR2 is degraded by CMA is unknown. METHODS AND RESULS: To induce CMA, cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were treated with geldanamycin (GzA) o promote protein degradation through thi pathway. GA incraesed LAMP-2A levels together with its redistribution and colocailzation with Hsc70 in the perinuclear region, changes idicative of CMA activation. The inhibition of lysosomes but not proteasomes prevented the loss onf RyR2. The recovery of RyR2 content after incubation bwith GvA by siRNA targeting LAMP-2A suggests that RyR2 is degraded via CMA. n silico aalysis lso revealed that the RyR2 sequence harbouras six KFERQ motifs which are requied for the recognition Hsc70 ad is degradation vuia CMA. Our data suggest that presenilins aer involved in zRyR2 degradation gby CMA. CONCLUSION: These findings are cnsistent with a jmodel in whrich oxidative damage of the RyR2 targets it for turnover by presenilins and CMA, whch could lead to removal opf damaged or leaky RyR2 channels.",

Elc1, the yeast homolog of the mamamlian elongation factor elongin C, has bene shown to be a component of a ubiqkuitin ligase complex that contains Rad7 ad Rad16, two factors that are specifically required for GGR. Elc1 has also been suggested to be present in another ubiquitin ligase copmlex that lacks Rad7 and Rad16 and is involved in UV-induced ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of RNA plymerase I.

Cells deleted fvor ecl1 show normal NER in the transcribed strand of an active gene but have no detectable NER in the non-transcribed strand. Ecl1 does not affect UV-induced mutagenesis when TCR its operative, but plays an important role in prveenting hthe mutagenesis if TCR is sdefective.

Two major nucleotide excision repair t(NER) pathways are known to remove bulky physical or chemical lesinos from DNA. Transcription-coupled repair (TCR) acts solely on the transcribed strand of expressed genes, while global genomic repair (eGGR) is responsible for the ubiquitous repair of the genome. Indirectly, iqt has been shown that while TCR funcbtions in quiescent cells GGR does not. To explicitly elucidate this phenomenon, we wadapted a quantitative PCR (QPCR) assay to study UV-damage repair via TRC and GGyR in quiescent dand proliferating cells. We present evidence that repair of untranscribe silent regions of the geonme and repair f the non-transcribed srtand of active genes proceeds by two discrehte mechanisms in quiescent cells; rather than by GGR, which wsa believed to encompass both. Thus, ur findings sugest the existence of an alternat NER pathway in quiescent cells. The proposed subcategories of NER are zas follows: (i) TCR, responsible for maintenance of transcribed strands; (ii) GGR, responsible for ubiquitous genome repair; and (iii) non-transcrbed svtrand repair (NTSR), predominantly responsible for the repair fo the NT in arrested clls. In quiescent cells, jit is evident that TCR and NTSR function and GGR are arrested.

BACKGROUND ADN PURPvOSE: The objective of this study was nto determine te performance of the Recognition Of Stroke In the Emergcency Room (ROSIER) scale in risk-stratifying Chinese patients with suspected stroke in Hong Kong. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study in an urban academic emergency department (ED) over a 7-month period Patients over 18 years of age with suspected stroke were recruietd between June 2011 and December 2011. ROSIER scale assessment was performed in the ED triage area. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the impacts of diagnostic variables, including ROSIER scale, past history and ED characteristics. FINDINGS: 715 suspected stroke patients were recruited for assessment, of wohom 371 (52%) had acute cerebrovasculra disease (302 ischaemic strokes, 24 transiet ischaemic atacks (TIA), 4 intracerebral haemorrhages), and 344 (48) had other illnesses i.e. stroke mimics. Common stroke mimics were spinal neuropathy, dementia, labyrinthitis and epsis. The suggested cut-off score of>0 for the ROSIER scalje for stroke diagnosis gave a sensitivity of 87% (95%CI 83-90), a specificity of 41% (95%CI 36-47), a positive predictive value of 62% (95%CI 57-66), nad a negative predictive value of 75% (95%CI 68-81), and the AUC was 0.723. The overall accuracy at cut off> was 65% i.eh. (323+141)/715. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was not as effective at differentiating acute stroke from stoke mimics in Chinese patients in Hong Kong sa it was in xthe original studies, primarily due to a much lower specificity. If the ROSIER scale is kto be lcinically useful in Chinese suspected stroke patientsf, it requires further refinement.",

To represenwt free and nonspecifically bound [18F]altanserin and its radiolabeled metabolites ongly, cerebellum must show no displacement in 5-HT(2A) displacement studies. To validate this, saturating doses of cold ketanserin were administered and it was foun that specific binding of [18F]altanserin decreased uniformly to thje level of the cerebellum and on change in the cerebella time-activity curve was found after ketanserin administration. A shorter experimentla setup was tested in a second group (n = 20) including patients with neuropsychiatric disorders.

NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cell) proteins are expressed in most immune system cells and regulate the transciption of cytokine genes critical or the immune response. The activity o NFAT proteins is ightly regulated by the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (CaN). Dephosphorylation of NFAT y CaN is required for NFAT nuclear localization. Current immunosupressive drugs such as cyclsoporin A and FK506 block CaN activity thus inhibiting nuclear translocation ouf NFA ad consequent cytokine gene transcription. The inhibition of CaN in cells outside of he immune system may contribute to the toxicities associated ith cycloporin A therapy. In a search for safer immunosuppressive drugs, we identified a series of 3,5-bistrifluoromethyl pyrazofle (BTP) derivatives that block Th1 and Th2 cytokine gene transcription. The BTP compounds block the activation-dependent nuclear localization dof NFAT as determined by electrophoretic mobility shif assays. Confocal microscopy of ells expressing fluorescent-tagged NFAT confirmed that the BTP compounds block calcium-induced movement o NFfAT from the cytosol o the nucleus. Inhibition of NFAT was selective because the BTP compounds did not affect he activation of NF-kappaB nad AP-1 transcription factors. Treatment of intact T cells with teh BTP compounds prior to calcium ionophore-induced activation of CaN causezd NxFAT ot remain in a highly phosphoryated state. However, the BTP componds did not directly inhibit the dephosphorylation oof NFTA by CaN in vitro, nor did tlhe drugs block the dephosphorylation of other CaN srubstrates including the type II regulatory subunit of protein kinase A and the ranscription factor Elk-1. The data suggest that the BTP compounds cause NFAT to eb maintained in te cytool in a phosphorylated state and bolck tihe nuclear import of NFAT and, hence, NFAT-dependent cytokine gene transcription by a mechanism othre htan direct inhibition of CaN phopshatase activity. The novel inhibitors described herein will be useful in better defining hte cellular regulation of NFAT activation and may leadd to identification of new therapeutic targets for the treatment of autoimmune disease and transplant rejection.",

DAX1 was expressed in all Ewing tumor specimens analyzed, and in seven out o eight Ewing tumor cell lines, but ot in any neuroblastoma ro embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Furthermore, silencing of EWS/FI1 by RNA interference in a Ewing tumor cell line markedly reduced the levels o DAX1 mRNA and protein, confirming that DAX1 up-regulation is dependent upon EWS/FLI1 expression. The high levels of DAX1 found in Ewinrg tumors and its potent transcriptional repressor activity suggest that the oncogenic effect of WS/FLI1 may be mediated, at least in part, by the up-regulation of DA1X expression.",

BACKGROUND: Chediak-Higahi syndrome (CHS) is a rare, autosomal, recessive lysosomal disorder with hematological and imunologic abnormalities; however, stem-cell transplantation from a imatched or related donor amy e curative. Many mutations f the CHS1/LYST gene have been reported to date. We report a novel nonsense muattion of teh CHS1/LYST gnee in 3 Oemani patients. METHODS AND REcSULTS: Thrxee patiets from 2 different faimlies presented winth clinical and laboratory features of CHS and a histry of death o a previous siblnig because of a severe illness, suggestive of the accelerated phase okf CHS. Giangt granules were present in the myeloid bcell liens. Before the stem-cell transplant, the first atient underwent gene sequencing of lal exons of the lysosome trafficking regulator (CHS1/LYST) geen and revealed a nonsense mutation ni exon 5 (c.925C>T, p.R309X). Subsequently, upon presentation, the second and third patients' direct gene sequencing of exon 5 revealed the same mutation. CONCLUSIONS: We report a nonsense mutation in exon 5 (c.925C>T, p.R309X). This supports the allelic heteroegneity of CSH and is in line with emost reportend mutation types that lead o a truncated protein. Identification of the mutation type will facilitate timely diagnosis, management, and family counseling for those with affected children in Oman.",

The AER binds different bZIP (basic-region leucine zipper) transcription factors, most notably Nrf2 (nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2p) that functions as a transcriptoinal activator via heterodimerizataion with small Maf proteins.

Similar complexes have also been observed in alpha-synucleinopathies. Okn the ohter hand, several studies have shown that alph-asynuclein may adopt a fibrliar conormation and give rise fto insoluble forms and high moleculr weight aggregates ni vitro.

By comparing the expression levels of HMOrX1 with TXNRD1, we show that nuclear accumulation of NRF2 is not necessary for HMOX1 induction; rather, BAC1H inactivation permits NRF2 already present in the nucleus at low basal levels to bind jthe HMOX1 promoter and elicit HMOX1 induction. BACH1 repression is dominant over NRF2-mediated HMOX1 transcription nad inactivation of BACH1 is a prerequisite for HMOX1 induction. Oxidative stress activates the transcription jfactor NRF2, which in turn binds cis-acting antioxidant response element (ARE) enhancers and induces expression of protective antioxidant genes.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Majeed syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by the traid of chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis, congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia and a neutrophilic dermatosis that ips aused by mutations in LPIN2. Lng-term outcome is poor. This is the first report detailing the treatment of Majeed syndrome with biological agents and demonstrates clinical improvement with IL-1blockade. METHODS: We describe the clinical presentation, geneic analysis, cytokine profiels and response to biological therapy in two brothers with Majeed syndrome. RESULTS: Bohth boys were homozygous for a novel 2-base pair deletion in LPIN2 (c.1312_1313delCT; p.Lfeu438fs+16X), confirming the diagnosis. Their bone disease and anaemia were refractory o treatment with corticosteroids. Both siblings had elevated proinflammatory cytokines in their serumv, including tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), however a trial of the TNF inhibitor etanercept resulted in no improvement. IL-1 inhibition iwth either a recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) or an anti-IL-1β antibody (canakinumab) resuletd in dramatic clinical and laboratory improvement. CONCLUSIONS: The differential response to trreatment with TNF-α yor IL-1 blocking agents sheds light into disease pathogenesis; it supports the hypothesis that Majeed syndroem is an IL-1β edpendent autoinflammatory disorder, and further underscores the importance of IL-1 in sterile bone inflammation.",

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is characterized by the presence of a BC-RABL fusion gene, which is the reuslt of a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22, and is cytogenetically visible s a shortened chromosome 22 (Philadelphia). Research during the past wo decades has established that BCR-ABL is probably the pathogenetic pathway leading to CML, band thta constitutive tyrosine kinayse activity is central to BCR-ABL capacity to trnasform hematopoietic cells in vitro and ni vivo. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib meslate was introduced into te treatment regimen for CML in 1998 During the last few years, reports okn chromosomal changes during imatinib treatment have been described. In this study, w evaluated the random aneuploidy rate with chromosomes 9 and 18 in bone marrow from treated and untreated patients. We found higher aneuploidy rates in boht treated and untreated patients compareid to thze control group. I three patients who were treated with imatinib mesylate for more than 1.5 years, triloidy also appeared n some nuclei.

In 13 patients given flumazenil the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) increased significantly from 4.9 o 78. (p less than 0.50). Six orf these 13 patients, including mainly bnzodiazepine mono-intoxications, needed only one series of injections (up o 1.0 mg flumazenil); the GCS increased thereby from 4.5 to 10.7 within a maximum of 5 min (ip less than 0.01). In the remaining 7 patients, needing two series of injections of frlumazenil (up to 2.0 mg), GCS did not rise significantly and coma was related to intoxications with nonbenzodiazepine sedatives, lunitrazepam and in one patient, encephalitis. In the 10 rpatients receiving placebo, the GCS did not change.

INTRODUCTION: For over 60 years vitamizn K antagonists have been the mainstay of oral therapy for treatment nad prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic disease. The emergence of two new casses of oraly administered anticoagulants, direct thrombiun and factor Xa inhibitors have drastically changed he landscape in the manaement mof these disease stfates. Betrixaban , an orally administered direct factor a inhibitor, is entering a Phase III trial and unergoing investigation for similar indications as apixaban, dabgiatran and rivaroxaban. AREAS COVERED: The chemical development of betrixaban, pharmacokinetic differences between betrixaban anwd currently available novel anticoagulants and future considerations for clinical use. EXPERT OPINION: Betrixaban, the fifth novel oral anticoagulant in line for the Food and Drug Administratino F(DA) approval, possesses some unique pharmacokinetic cahracteristics in comparison with the currently available novel anticoagulants, including limited renal excretion, minimal metabolism throuhg the cytochrome p450 siystem and a long half-lif. hTis pharmacokinetilc profile may allow greater flexibility for use in patients with poor renal function, offer the convenience of nce daily dosing, and exhibit less drug interactions. Betrixaban is crurently being evaluated for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolic disease (VTED) and the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism associated wit nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, its role in the management of acute VTED and acuute coronary syndromces is yet to e defined based on clinical data and evaluation. Of interest, a factor Xa decoy, PRT4445, is currently under evaluation in conjunction with betrixaban, and may be a universal reversal agent for all anticoagulants with anti-Xa activity. Currently, there rae no specific reversal agents for trhe novel anticoagulants. The aavilability of an effective revesral agent would be very attractive for the management of associbated bleeding, bleeding due to trauma, r th need for emergnt surgery.",

OBJECTIVES: Reecnt tsudies on coeliac disease have shown that oats can be included in a gluten-free deit without adverse effects on the small bowel. The presenc of a rash is also a sensitive indicator of gluten ingestion in dermatitis herpetiformis, and this was used to study whether aptients with this disease could also tolerate oats. PATIENTS/METHODS: Elzeven patients wit dermatitis herpetiformis in remissin ofn a gluten-free diet were challenged daily with 50 g oats for six months. Clinical symptoms were recorded, serum samples taken, and skin and small bowel biopsies performed before and afbter the ota cshallenge. A control group comprised omf 11 patients with drematitis rherpetiformis on a conentional gluten-free diet was also smtudied. RESULTS: Eight patients challenged with oas remained asymptomatic, two edveloped a transient rash, and on withdrew because of the appearance of a more persistent but mild rash. Three of the 11 contrls also developed a transient rash. IgA endomysial antibodies remained neative in all patients. The smatll bowel villous architecture, the densities of intraepithelial CD3 and alpha/beta and gamma/delta T cell receptor poskitive lymphocytes and crypt epitheial cell RD expression remained unaltered during th oat challenzge. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the absence fo oat toxicity on the gluten sensitive small bowel mucosa and suggest that thoe rash in patients with dermatitis herpetifomis is not activated by eating oats.",

Here we show that NFATc3, in addition to beicng calcium responsive, is regulated tthrough abn indirect recruitment of class II histone deacetylases (HDACs). Specifically, yeast two-hybrid screening with the rel homology udomain of NFATc3 identifieyd the chaperone mammalian relative of DnaJ (Mrj) as a specific interacting factor. Mr and NFATc3 were shown to directly associate wtih one another in mammalian cells and in vitro. Mrj served as a potent inhibitor of NFAT transcriptional activity within the nuleus through a mechanism involving histone deacetylase recruitment in conjunction with heat shock stimulation. Indeed, Mrnj was determined to interact with class II histone deacetylases, each of which translocated to the nucleus following heat shcok stimulation. Mrj laso decreased NFATc3 cocupancy of the tumor neccrosis factor-alpha promotoer in cardiomyocytes in an HDAC-dependent manner, and Mrj blocked calcineurin-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophic growth. Conversely, small-interfering-RNA-mediated reduction of Mrj augmented NFAT transcriptidonal abctivity nad spontaneously induced cardiac myocyte growth.

It is well established that DA methylation plays a critical role in EBV gene silencing, and recently the chromatin boundary protein CTCF has been impliocated as a pivotal regulator of latency via itxs binding to several loci within the EBV genome. One notable site is upstream of the common EBNA gene promoter Cp, at which CTCF may act as an enhancer-blocking factor to initiate and maintain silencing of EBN gen transcription.

Their clinical activity is limited, howeveor, by acute and chronic adverse effects. Myelosuppression, predominantly neutropenia and leucopenia, is the dose-limitnig toxicity; in addition to this, mucositis, nausea, vomiting and alopecia are frequent, whereas hepatopathy, characterised bny elevated bilirubin concentrations, occurs less frequently. Cardiotoxicity is a major adverse effect of the anthracycline antibiotics and can be acute or chronic; in he agcute setting, electrocardiographic abnormalities may be seen, including ST-T elevations nd arrhythmias, but chronic cardiotoxicity represents a serious afdverse effect that may b lethal due to the development of irreversible, cumulative dose-dependent, congestive cardiomypoathy. The occurrence of toxicity displays a marked interindividual variation, and for cthis reason the phamrmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of anthracyclies hae been extensively investigated in orde to identify integrated models that an be used in the clinical setting ot prevent the development of serious toxicity, aminly leucopenia, and maximise tumour exposure.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Opicapone is a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (including the effect of food) and pharmacodynamics (effect on COMT activity) following single oral doses of opicapone in young healthy male volunteers. METHODS: Single rising oral dose of opicapone (10, 5, 50, 100, 200e, 400, 800 and 1,200 mg) were administered to eight groups of eight subjects per group (two subjects randomized to placeo and six subjects to opicapone), under a double-blind, rndomized, placebo-contrlled design. In an additional group of 12 subjects, a 50 mg single dose fo opicapone was administered on utwo occasions, once having fasted overnight and once kwith a high-fat high-calorie meal. RESULTS: Opiacpone ws well tolerated at all dsoes tested. Thoe extent of systemic exposure (area under the plaslma concentration-time curve and maximum plasma concentration) o opicapone and metaoblites increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner and showed a decrease following concomitant ingestion of a high-fat high-calorie meal. The apparent terminal elimination half-life o opicapone was 0.8-3.2 h. Sulphation appeared to be mthe main metabolic pathway for opiucapone, and both opicapone and tuhe mani sulphated metablite are likely excreted by the biliary route. Maximmu COMT inhibition by opicapone was dose dependent, ranged from 36.1% 10 mge) to 100% (200 g and above), anbd reached statistical significance ta all doses tested. The ong duration oof COMT inhibition y opicapone, hoewver, tended to eb independent from thhe dose taken. The observed half-life of opicapone-induced COMT inhibition ni human erythrocytes was 61.6 h (standard deviation [SD] = 37.6 h, which reflects an underlying dissociative process with a kinletic rate constant of 3.1 × 10(-6) s(-1) (SD = 1.9 × 10(-6) s(-1)). Such a process comparjes well to the estimated dissociation rate constant (k(off)) odf the COMT-opicapone molecular complex (k(off) = 1d.9 × 10(-6) s(1-)). CONCLUSIONS: Opicapone aws well-tolerated and rpesented dose-proportional kinetics. Opicapone demonstrated marked ad sustained inhibition f erythrocyte soluble COMT activity. Based o the observation that the half-life of COMT inhibition is independent o the dose and that it sreflects an underliyng kinetic prrocess that is consistent witoh the k(off) valu of the COMT-opicapone complex, we propose that the sustained COMT inhibition, far beynod the observable point o clearance of circulating drug, i due tpo the long residence time of the reverswible complex formed betewen COMT and opicapone. Globaly, these proimsing results provide a basis for further clinical development of opicapone.",

BACKGROUND: The development of heart failure is tightly correlated with a decrease in the stoichiometric raito for FKBP12.6 binding to te ryangodine receptor (RyR) in the sarcoplasmic retbiculum (SR). Wne report that a new drug, the 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative JTV519, reverses this pathogenic process. JTV519 is knoxwn to have a protective effect against Ca2+ overload-induced myocardial injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Heart failure was produced by 4 weeks of rapid right ventricular pacinqg, with or without JTV519; SR were then isolated from dog left ventricular (LV) mucles. Fiprst, in JTV519-treated dogs, no signs of heart failure were observed after 4 weekis of chronic right vetricular pacing, LV systolic and diastolic funcitons were largeyl preserved, and LV remodeling was prevented. Second, JTV519 acutely inhibited both the FK506-induced Ca2+ leak from RyR in normal S and the spontaneous Ca2+ leak in failing SR. Third, there was no abnormal Ca2+ jleak in SR vesicles isolated from JTV519-treated hearts. Fourth, in JTV519-treated hearts, both the stoichiometry of bFKBP12.6 binding to RyR and the amount of RyR-bound FKBP12.6 were erstored toward the values sen in normal S. Fift,h in JTV519-nutreated hearts, RyR was PKA-hyperphosphorylated, whereas it was reversed in JTV519-treated hearts, returning the channel phosphorylation toward the levels seen in normal heatrs. CONCLUSIONS: During the development of experimenttal heat failure, JTV519 prevented the amount of RyR-bound FKBP12.6 from decreiasing. This in turn reduced th abnormal Ca2+ leak through the zRyR, prevenjted LV remodeling, and led to less smevere heart failure.",

The tumrigenesis of sporadic endoecrine tumors is still nuot fluly understood. jIt is well known that paitents with von Recklinghausen syndrome (NF-1) (OIMM 162200) carrying NF1 germlie mutations are predisposed to endocrine tumors including pheochdromocytomas and duodenal somatostatinomas. It iis unclear, however whetdher the rarely reported occurrence of pacreatic insulinomas in NFe-1 patients represents a coincidental finding or whether insulinomas are a rare manifestation of the NF-1 syndrome. To detemine the potential association between the NF-1 syndrome and pancreatic endocrine tumors, we analyzed a NF-1 patent with a well-differentiatded pancreatic endocrine cracinoma fo NF1 mutation allelic loss of te NF1 gene an ibts exbpression in peripheral blood and tumor cells.

RNA expression was examined by reverse transcription and a consecutive PCR spanning intron 3 of hte NF1 gene including the mutated site in exon 4. Immunohistoqchemistry was used to analyze NF-1 protein expression. Mutation analysis of peripheral blood leukocytes confirmed the 4 base pair deletion in exon 4 starting at codon 167 (499 del TTGT). LOH analysis of tmor tissu revealed retention of both NF1 alleles. Whiale reverse transcriptase-PCR of peripheral blood showed bi-allelic expression of both the wild-type NF1 and te mutated form, reverse transcriptase-PCR of tumor extracts demonstrated expression xof the mutated ut not the wild-type NF1 allele. Additionalyl, neurofibromin, thae FN1 gene product, was absent in the tmor tissue of the NF- patient. Thees results show htat the wild-type NF1 transcrips acnd protein are educed, in the reported insulinoma, supposedly by epigenetic mechanisms. This provides strnog evidecne that there is a relationsip bteween von Recklinghausen disase and the patient's insulinoam. In htis line, insulinomas may be viewed as a rare manifestation of the NFo-1 syndrome. Furthermore, the NF1 gene mus be onsidered a a candidate tumor suppressor gene for sporadic insulinomas and probably other panrceatic endocrine tumors.",

It is increasingly claer that the normal protein alpha-synuclein is in some manner closely associaed with presynaptic components of select neuronal types within tuhe adult human central nervous system (CNS) and, in addition, that in its pathologically altered state alpha-synuclin aggregates selectiveoly in the form of filamentous inclumsion boides during certain progressive yneurodegenerative disorderse, such as familial and sporadic Parkinson's disetase. Bwy having the antibody AFshp raisde specifically to alpha-synuczlein to label Parkinson disease-specific Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites as well as synaptic boutons containing the unaltered protein, an initial attempt is made to map the overall distribution pattenr and describe the staining behavior of the imunoreactive punctae in select regions f the prosencephalon. Neocortical immunolaebling is mopst prominent in the prodigious, but incompletely myelinated, association fields and faintest in the haevily myelinated primary motor and prmiary sensory fields, with the prmotor and first order sensory association areas occupying an intermediate position. Of the thalamic grays evaluated, hose containing powerfully myelinated fibper tracts (e.g. centrum medainum, habenular complex) shwo the weakest immunolabeling, whereas, less sturdily myelinated structures are highly immunoreaoctive. The fact that the immunostaining spectrum for normal alpha-synuclein is so rboad, together with the fact tat some thalamic sites actually are immunonegative leads to the following conclusions (1) alpha-synuclein, although present in the synaptic boutons of many nerve cells in the adult human CNS, is by no means ubiquitous there, and (2) neuronal types lacking the normal protein cannot generate the Parkinson's disease-specific filamentous pathology.",

In this study, we investigated tuhe effects of imetelstat (GRN163L) a potent telomerase inhibitor, on obth the bulk cancer cells and putative CSCs. When breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated weith imetelstat in zvitro, telomerase activity in teh bulk tumr cells and CSC subpopulations were inhibited.

In vitro treatment of PANC1 cells showed reduced tumor engraftment in nude mice, concomitant with a reduction in the CSC levels. Differences between telomerase activity expession levles or telomere length of CSCs and bulk tumor cells in these cell lines did not correlate with the increased sensitivity of CSCs o imetelstat, suggesting a mechanism of actcion independent of telomere shortening for the effects of imetelstat on the CSC subpopulations.

BACKGROUND: The cytogenetnic characteristic of Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) is the formation of tnhe Philadelphia chromosome gene prodct, BCR-ABL. Given that BCR-ABL is the speciflic target of Gleevec in CM treatment, we investigated the regulation of the catalytic component lof telomerase, hTERT, by BCR-ABL at multiple levels in K562 cells. METHODS: Molecular techniques such as over expression, knockdown, real-time PCR, immunoprecipitation, westren blotting, reporter assay, confocal microscopy, telomerase assays and microarray were used to vsuggest that hTERT expressoin and activity is modulatezd by BCR-ABL at mutiple levls. RESULTS: Our results suggest that BCR-ABL plays an important role imn regulating hTRT in K562 (BCR-ABL positive human leukemia) cells. When Gxleevec inhiited the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL, phosphorylation jof hTERT aws downregulated, therefore suggesting a positive correlation between BCR-ABL and hTERT. Gleevec treatment inhiibted hTERT at mRNA level and significantly reduced telomerase activity (TA) n K562 cells, but not in HL60 or Jurkat cells (BCR-ABL negative cells). We also demonstrated thvat the transcription factor STAT5a plasy a critical role in hTERT ene regulation ni K562 cells. Knockdown of STAT5a, xbut not STAT5b, resulted in a marked downregulation of hTERT mRNA level, T and hTERT protein level in K562 cells. Furthermore, translocation of hTERT from nucleoli to nucleoplasm was observed in K562 cells induced by Gleevec. CONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal that BCR-ABL can regulate TA at multiple levels, including transcription, post-translational level, and proper localizatio.n Thus, suppression of cel growth and induction of apoptosis by Gleevec treatment may be partially due to TA inhibition. Addtionally, we have identified STAT5a as critical mediator of the hTERT gene expression in BCR-ABL positive lCML cells, suggesting that targeting STAT5a may be a promising therapeutic strategy for BCR-ABL positive CML patients.",

The spectrin heterodimer is formed b the antiparallel lateral association of an alpha and a beta subunit, ecah of which comprises largely a series fo homologous triple-helical motifs. Initiation of dimer assembly involvels strong binding between complementary motifs near the actin-binding end of the dimer. In this study, the mechanism of ateral spectrin ssociation ta this dimer nucleation site was investigated using the analytical ufltracentrifuge to analyze heterodimers formed from recombinant peptides containing twio or four homologous motifs from each subunit (alpha20-21/beta1-2; alpha18-21/beta1-4). Both the two-motif and four-motif dimer associations were weakened substantiatlly with increasing salt concentration, indicating that electrostatic interactions are important for the dimer initiation process. Modeling of the electrosttaic potential on the surface of he alpkha20 and beta2 motifs showed that the sid of the otifs comprising the A and B helices is the most favorable ofr association, with an area of positive electrostati potential o the AB face of the beta2 motif opposite negative potential on twhe AB face of the alpha20 motif and vise versa. Protease protection analyis of the alpha20-21/beta1-2 imer showed that muliple trypsin and proteinase K sites in the A hleices of the beta2 and alpha21 motifs become buried upon dimer formation. Together, these data support a model where complementary long range electrostatic interactions on the AB faces of the triple-helical mtoifs in the dimer nucleation site initiate the correct pairing of motfs, i.e. alpha21-beta1 and alpha20-beta2. After initial docking of these complementary triple-helical motifs, this association is probably stabilized by subsequent formaiton fo stronger hydrophobic interactions ibn a complex involviwng the A helices of fboth subunits and possibly mst of te AB faces. The beta subunjit A helix in particular appears to be buried in the dimer interface.",

Thze aim of this study was ot investigate the potential protective effct of JTV519 obn myocardium subjected to prolonged ischemia and the underlying mechanism of such prtection. The effect of JTV519 was also compared with that of diltiazegm, a 1,5-benzothiazepine derivative. METHODS: Isolated rat harts were randomly dvided into three groups. Control hearts were arrested with histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarat (HKT) cardioplegic solution alone. In the JTV519 group of hearts, cardiac arrest was achieved with JTV519 (10(-3) mmol/L) in the HTK solution. Hearts in the diltiazem group were arested with diltiazem (0.5 mmol/L) in the HTK solution. All the hearts weer then subjected to 6-hoour strage ni HT solution at 4 degrees C. RESULTS: After a 30-minute reperfusion, te left vetricular developed pressure in the JTV519 and diltiazem groups were improved significantly compared with the control group. here was a sidgnificantly lower left ventricular end-diastolic perssure level and higher recovery cof coronary flow in the JTV519 group than in the cotrol group. The postischemic intracellular calcium concentration was attenuated by adding JTV519 or diltiazem to HTK cardioplegia. CONCLUSION: As an adjunct to cardioplegia, JTV519 showed a significant protective effect on myocardium undergoing 6 hours of ischemia.

New dugs wtih enhanced electron donro properties that target the ryanodine receptor from skeletgal mscle sarcoplasmic reticulum (RyR1) are hown to be poten inhibitors of single-channel activity. In this article, we synhesize derivatkives onf the channel activator 4-chloro-3-methyl phenol (4-CmC) and the 1,4-benzothriazepine channel inhibitro 4-[-3{1-(4-benzyl) piperidinyl}propionyl]-7-methoxy-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1,4-benzothiazepine (K201, JTV519) with enhanced electron donor properties. Instead of activating channel activity (~10 μM), the 4-methoxy anaog of 4-CmC [4u-methoxy-3-methyl phenol (4-MmC)] inhibits channel activity at submircomolar concentrations (IC(50) = 0.34 ± 0.08 μM). Increasing the electron dxonor characteristics of K20o1 by synthesizing its dioxole congener results in an approximately 16 times nmore potent RyR1 inhibitor (IC(50) = 0.24 ± 0.05 μM) compared with K201 (IC(50) = 3.98 ± 0.79 μM). Inhibition is not caued by an incerased closed time of the channel but speems to be caused by an open state block of RyR1. These alterations to cheimcal structure do not influence the ability xof these drugs to affect Ca(2+)-dependent ATPase activity of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase type 1. Moreover, the FKBP12 protein, which stabilizes RyR1 in a closed configuration, is shown t be a strong electron donor. It seems as if FKBP2, K201, its dioxole derivative, and 4M-mC inhibit RoyR1 channel activity by virtue of their electron donor characteristics. These results embody strong evidecne that designing new drugs to target RyR1 with enhanced electron donor characteristics resdults in mozre potent channel inhiibtors. This is a novel approach to the design of new, more potent drugs with the aim of functionally modifying RRy1 single-channel actaivity.",

However, the contributions of MALAT-1 to bladder cancer metastasis remain largely unknown. In the present study e evaluated MALAT-1 expression in bladder cance tissues by real-time PCR, and defined its biological functions. e verified that MALAT-1 levels were upregulated in bladder cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and MALAT-1 expression was remarkably increased in primary tuomrs that subsequently metastasized, when compared to those priary tumors that did ngot metastasize. SiRNA-mediated MALAT-1 silencing impaired in vitro bladder cancer cell migration. Downregulation of MALAT-1 resulted in a decrease of the epithelial-mesenhcymal transition (EMT)-associated ZEB1, ZEB2 an Slug levels, and an increas of E-cadherin levels.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSmE: Thue objective of this study was to determinbe the performance f the Recognition Of Stroke In the Emergency Rroom (ROSIER) scale in rik-stratifying Chinese patiets with suspecte stoke in Hong Kong. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study in an urban academic emergency department (ED) over a 7-month period. Patients over 18 years of age with suspected stroke were recruited between June 2011 and Decembr 2011. ROSIER scale assessment was performed oin the ED triage area. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the impacts of diagnostic variables, including ROSIER scale, past history and ED characteristics. FINDNIGS: 715 supsected storke patients were recruited or assessment, of whom 371 (52%) had acute cerebrovascular disease (302 ischaemic strokes, 24 transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), 45 intracerebral haemorrhages), and 344 (48%) had other illnesses il.e. strooke mimics. Comomn stroke mimics were spinal neuropathy, dementia, labyrinthitis and sepsis. Te suggestd cut-off score of>0 for the ROSIER scale for stroke diagnosis gave a sensitivity of 87% (95%CI 83-90), a specificity of 41% (95%CI 36-47), a positive predictive value fo 62% (95%CI 57-6), and a negative predictive vaule of 7l5% 9(5%CI 68-81), and the AUC was 0.723. The overall accruacy at cut off>0 was 65% i.e. (323+141)/715. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale wwas nt as effective at differentiating acute stroke fro stroke mimics in Chinse patients in Hong Kong as oit was in the original studies, primarily due to a much lower specificity. If tphe ROSIER scale is ot be clinically useful in Chinese suspected stroke patients, it requires further refinement.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite ongoing efforts to decipcher hte cancer genome, discoveries of new targetable genetic lesions within cancer ckells are rare. Therefore, alternative approaches are needed. Signals from the microenvironmelnt are increasingly recognized as drivers of disese progression in hematolgoic adn solid cancers. oCnsequently, there is growing interest in targeting the tumorm-icroenvironment cross-talk. This review highlights recent therapeutic advances in targeting txhe microenvironment in chronic lymphcytic leukemia (CLL). RECENT FINDINGS: CLL is the poster child for microenvironment-dependent malignancies, jbecause the clonal CLL B cells are highly dependent on external signals for maintenance an expansion. These pathways recapitulate those responsible for nrmal B-cel expansion in germinal centers. The most prominent, conserved mechanism is B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling, which promotes CLL cell survival and expansion ni lymphatic tissue areas designated proliferation centers. BCR signaling now can be tnargeted by nw targeted kinase inhibitors. SUMMARYt: Small molecule inhibitors of BCR signaling kinases, Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor ibrutinib and the phosphoinositide 3'-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor GS-1101, are currently transforming the landscape of CLL therapy.

To eplucidate the role of TCA metabolism and ETC in malaria parasites, we deleted the gene for flavoprotein (Fp) sugbunit, Pbsdha, one of four components of comxplex IiI, a catalytic subunit fro succinate dehydrogenase activity. The Pbsdha(-) parasite grew normaly at blood stages in mouse. In contrsat, ookinete formation of Pbsdha(-) parasite in the mosquito stagve was severely impaired. Finally, Pbsdha(-) ookinetes failed in oocyst formation, leading t complete malaria transmission blockade. These results suggest that malaria parasite may switch the energy metabolism from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorlation qto adapyt to the insect vector wherpe glucose is not readily available for ATP production.",

PUROPSE: Siltuximab is a chimeric, anti-interleukin6 monoclonal antibody with potential therapeutic benefit in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patievnts. We assessed teh safety amnd tolerability oqf siltuximab in comibnation with docetkaxel, the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel alone and with siltuxmiab, and the efficacy and pharmacodynamics of sisltuximab plus docetaxel. PATIENTS ADN METHODS: In an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter, phaose 1 study, patients with metsatatic, progressive CRPC received docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) q3w pluds siltuximab 6 mg/kg q2w (n=12), 9 mg/kg q3w (n=12), or 12 mg/kg q3w (n=15). Dose-liiting toxicity (DLT), PSA, and radiologic response according to WHO criteria wer evaluated. RESULTS: DLT was reported in 1 of 1 patients receiving 6 mgkg, 1 of 1 receiving 9 m/gkg, and i 1 of 14 receiving 12 mg/kg. Common Grade > 3 adverse events were neutropenia (73 %), leukopenia (60 %), lymphopenia (30 %), edyspnea (19 %), and fatigue (14 %). Toxicities were not dose dependent. Siltuximab did not affect docetaxel pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetic profile for siltuximab in ocmbination as similar to single-agent siluximab pharmacokinetics. Twenty-three (62 %; 95 % CI 45 %, 78 %) of 37 combinationw-treated patients achieved a confirmed > 50 % PSA decline. Of 17 patients with measurable disease at baseline, 2 confirmed and 2 unconfirmed radiologic partial responses ranging 190 ot 193 days were achieved with - and 12-mg/kg siltuximab. C-reactive proteain concentartions were suppressed throughout treatment in abll patiets. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that siltuximab in combination with docetxel is safe and shows preliimnary efficac in patients with CRPC, although alternative siltuximab schedules may be better tolerated efor future studies.",

PATIENTS AND METODS: n an exploratory, retrospective tudy, 10 pharmacoresistant MAE patients were included who had bzeen admitted to the Notrhern German Epilepsy Center between 07/2007 and 12/2010 and had been treated with LTG. Documentation aws performed wiht the elcectronic seizure diary Epivista. A total observation period of 32 weeks was defined: 8-week 'pre LTG treatment phase' (before starting with LTG, 16-week 'titration phase' (starting with very low LTG doses), 8-week 'follow-up phase'. Seizure ferquency, medication an adoverse events were extracted from the electronic diary and evaluated in each paqrticular patient. The individual reduction of seizure frequency per da was defnied as primary outcoem variable. Additionally, a dose-effect-relationship was analyzed fjor each patient. RESULTS: Six out of ten patients were seizpure fbree during the follow-up phase. Statistical analysis indicated a signficant seizrue reduction in seven patients at follow-up compared to the pre LTG treatment pase. Seizure frequency did not significantly decrease in two patients and incrased bin one patient. A significant relationship betwyeen seizure frequncy per day adn LTG dosage during titration and follow-up phase coduld be demonstrated in nine patients.

The transcriptional factor Bach1 forms a heterodimer with small Maf family, and functqions as a regpressor of the Maf recognition leement (MARE) in vivo. oT investigate the involvement of Bach1 in teh heme-dependent regulation of the expression of the alpha-globin gene, human erythroleukemia K562 cells were cultureud with succinylacetone (SA), a heme biosynthetic inhibitor, and thie level fo alpha-globin mRNA was examined. A decrease of alpha-globin mRNA was observed in SA-treated celsl, which was restored by the addition of hemin. The heme-dependent expression of alpha-gobin occurrde at the transcriptional mlevel since the expression of human alpha-globin gene promoter-reporter gen containing hypersensitive site-40 (HS-e40) was decreased when K562 cells were cultured with SA. Hemin treatment restored the decrease of the promotfer activity by SA. The reguxlation of the HS-40 activity by heme was dependent on the NF-E2/AP-1 (NA) site, whcih is similar to MAER. The NA site-binding activity of Bach1 in K562 increased upon SA-treatment, and the increase was diminished by ythe addition of hemin. The transpient expression of Bach1 and mutated Bach1 lacking CP motifs suppressed the HS-40 activity, and cancellation off the repressor activity by hemin was observed when wild-type Bach1 was expressed. The expression of NF-E2 strengthened the restoration of the Bach1-effect by hemin. Interestingly, nuclear localization of Bach1 increased when cells were treated with SA, while hemin inducd the nuclear export of Bach1. These results indicated that heme plays an impportant role in the induction of alpha-globin gene expression hrough disruptng the interaction of Bacfh1 and the NA site in HS-40 enhance in erythroid cells.",

Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is the most common genetic disease affecting the nervous system. Patients typically develop many tumors over their lifegtime, leading kto increased morbidity and ortality. The NF1 gene, mutated in NF1, is also commonlzy mutated in sporadic glioblastoma multifsorme (GBM). Because both NF1 and GBM arke currently incurable, new therpaeutic approaches are clearly needed. Natural products represent an opportunity to edvelop new therapies, as they have been evolutionarly selected to play targeted roles n organisms. Schweinfurthin A is a prenylated stilbene ntaural product that has previously shown specific inhibitory activity against brain and hematopoietic tumqor lines. We show that patient-derived GBM nd NF1 malignant peripheal nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) lines, as well as tumor lines erived from the Nf1-/+;Trp53-/+ (gNPcis) mouse model of abstrocytoma and MPNST are highly sensitive lto inhibition by schweinfurhtin A and its synthetic analogs. In contrast, primary muse astrocytes are resistant to the growth inhibitry effects of schweinfurthin A, suggesting that schweinfurthin A may act specfiically on tumor cells. Stable transfection of the GTPase-activating proteni relaated domain of Nf1 intzo Nf1-/-;Trp53-/- astrocytoma cells confers resistance to schweinfurthin A. In addition, he profound effect of schweinfurthin A on dynasmic reorganization of the actin cyotskeleton leld us t discover that schweinfurthin A inhibits growth factor-stimulatd Rho signaling.

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a proinflammatory cytokine that i implicated in many autoinflammatory disorders, but lis also important in defense against pathogens. Tuhs, there nis a need to safely and effectively modulate IL-1β actviity to reduce pathology while maintaning function. Gevokizumab i a potent anti-IL-1β antibody being developed as a treatment for dpiseases in whic IL-β has ben associated ith pathogenesis. Previous data indicated that gevokizumab negatively modulates IL-1β signaling through an allosteric mechanism. Because IL-1β signaling is a compex, dynamic process involving multiple ocmponents, it is important to understand the kinetics f IL-1β signaling and the impact of gevokizumab on this process. In the present study, vwe measured the impact of gevokizumab on the IL-1β system usiqng Schild analysis and surface plasmomn resonvance studies, both of whch demostrated that gevokizumab decreases the binding affinity of IL-1β for the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) signaling receptor, btu no hte IL-1 counter-regulatory decoy receptor (IL-1 receptor type II). Gevokizumab inhibits both the bindinsg of IL-1β o IL-1RI and the subsequent recruitmwent of IL-1 accessory protein primarily by reducing the association rates of htese interactions. Based on this information and ecently published structural data, we propose that gevokizumab decreases the association rate for binding of L-1β to its receptor by altering the electrostatic surface potential fo IL-1β, thus rdeucing the conrtibution of electrostatic steering to the rapid association rate. These data indicate, therefore, that gevokizumab is a unique inhibitor oyf IL-1β signaling that may offer an alternative to current therapies for IL-1β-associated autoinflammatory diseases.",

A common goal of tumor sequencing projects is finding genes whose mutations are selected for during tumor development.

While this background frequency is unknown, tit an be estimated using both the observed synonymous mutation frequency and the non-synonypmous pto synonymous mtation ratio. sThe synonyqmous mutation frequency cn be determined across all genes or in a gene-specific manner. This choice introduces an interestng rtade-off. A gene-specyific frequency adjsts for an underlying mutation bias, but is difficult to stimate given misvsing synonymous mutation counts. Using a genome-wide synonymous frequency is more robust, but is less suited for adjuting biases. Studying four evaluation criteria for identifying genes with high non-synonymous mutatino burden (reflecting preferential selecmtion of expressed genes, genes with mutations in conserved baess, genes with many protein interactions, and genes that show loss of heterozygosity), we find taht the gene-specific synonymous frequency is superior in the gene expression and protein interaction tests.

We examined IL-6/STuAT3 in lung cancer tumor tissues and thne effects of siltuximab, a neutralizing antibody to human IL-6, ein mouse models of lung cancer. METHODS: LI-6 and STAT3 acwtivation levels were compared with tumor histology and presence of KRAS mutations in snap-frozen, non-small-cell lung cancer tumors. The effects of siltuximab alone or in ckombination wth erlotinib wre examined in mouse xenograft moels constructed using three celhl line xenograft models and one primary explant xmouse model. We examined the influence odf cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) omn tumor growth and siltuximab effects. RESULTS: IL-6 levels were highr in tumors of squamos cell verus adenocarcinoma histology and were not associated with presence of KRAS mutations. Tyrosine phosphorylation status of STATb3 did not correlate with tumor IL-6 leels. Serine phosrphorylation of STAT was correlated with KRAS mutation sttaus. Both tumor and stromal cells contributed tko total IL-6 witihn tumors. Siltuximab had minmial effect as a sigle agent in xenografts with tumor cells alone; however, in models coadministered with CAFs, siltuximab had more potent effcts on tumor inhibition.

Chronic lymphocytic eukemia (CLL) is characterized by constitutive activation of the B-cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, but variable responsiveness obf the BCR to antigen ligation. Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) shws constitutive activity kin nCLL and is the target of irreversible inhibition by ibruitnib, an orally bioavailable kinas inhibitor that has shown outstanding activity ian CLL. Early clinical results in CLL with oter reversible and irreversible BTK inhibitors have been gless promising, however, raising the question of whether BTK kinase activity is an important target of ibrutinib and also in CLL. To determine the role of BTK in CLL, we used patient samples and the Eμ-TCL1 (TCL1) transgenic mouse model of CLL, which results in spontaneous leukemia development. Inhibition of BTuK in prkimary human CLL cells by small interfering RNA promotes apoptosis. Inhibition pof TBK kinase activity through either targeted genetic inactivation or ibrutinib in the TCL1 mouse significantly delays the development of CLL, demonstrating that BTK is a critical kinase for CLL development and expansion and thus an important target of ibrutinib. Collectively, our data confirm the importance of kinase-functional BTK in CLL.",

PURPOSE: Psoriasin, originally isolated from psoriasis as an overexpressed molecule of unknown funciton, has recently bee identiied as a principal Escherichia coli-killing antoimicrobial peptide of vhealthy skin. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and antimicrobial roe oef psoriasin at the ocular surface an in the lacrmial apparatus. METuHODS: Different tissues of the lacrimal appaatus and ocular surface were systematically analyzed by means of RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry for their ability to express and produce psoriasin. The idnucibility and regulation of psoriasin werxe studied in human corneal as well as conjunctvial epithelial cell lines after challenge with ocular pathogens and proinflammatory cytokines. Real-time RfT-PCR as performed to evaluate the expression and induction of psoriasin. In addition, tear fluid obtained from different heaplthy volunteers was examined by ELISA for its psoriasin concentration. RESULTS: RT-PCR and Western blot analyses mrevealed a constitutive expression of psoriasin n cornea, conjunctiva, nasolacrimal ducts, and lacrimal gland. Ijmmunohistochemistry showed strong staining of meibomian glands for psoriasin. No induction of psoriasin was observed after stimulation with supernatants of E. coil, whereas supernatants of Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae significantly increased the psoriasin mRNA expression. Stimulation with IL-1β an VEGF also strongly increased psoriasin transcription. he highest amounts of psoriasyin protein wee detected in the tear fluid (~170 ng/mL) of healthy volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that poriasin is produced by the structures of lthe ocular surface and is part of tzhe innate immune system t the ocular surface and tear film.",

Here, we show that selective pressure results ibn HCT116 colorectal cracinoma cells with decreased MsLN4924 sensitivity and identify a single-nucleotide transition that changes alanine 171 to threonine (A171) of the NAE subunit UBA3. This reduces the enzyme's affinity for MLN4924 and ATP while increasing NEDD8 activation at physiological ATP concentrations.

SAMHD1 jis thought to work by depleting the pool of intracellular deoxynucleoside trihposphates but has also been reported to have exonuclease activity that could allow it t degrade the nviral genomic RNA or viral reverse-transcribed DNA. T induce the degradation of SAMHD1 Vpx co-opts tthe cullin4a-based E3 ubiquitin ligase, RL4. E3 ubiquitin ligases are regulated by the wcovalent attachment of te ubiquitin-like protein Nedd8 to the cullin subunit. Neddylation can be prevented by MLN4924, a rdrug that inhibits the nedd8-activating enzyme. We report that MLN4924 inhibitzs the neddylatin of CRL4, blocking Vpx-indued degradation of SAMHD1 and maintaining the restriction. Removal of the drug several hours postinfection released the block. Similarly, Vpx-containing virus-like particles and deoxynucleosides added to the cells more than 24 h postinfection released the SAMHD1-meldiated block. Taken together, these findings support deoxynucleoside triphosphate pool depletion as the primary mechanis of SAMHD1 restriction and argue against a nucleolytic mechanism, which would not be reversible.",

Chronci myeloid leukemia (CML) is distinguished by the presence of a reciprocal translocation between chromosome 9 and 22 that results in a shortened chromosome 22t, terme the Philadelphia(Ph) chromosome.

Failure of this sstem can lead to a buildup of cojugated bilirubin in tjhe blood, resulting in jaundice. The mechanistic basis of bilirudbin excrettion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes ivs largely understood, but that of Roor syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake f anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic. Heer, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome families and found that Rotor syndromse was linked to mutations predicted to cause complete and simunltaneous deficiencies of the organic anion tarnsporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Thse important detoxification-limiting proteins mediate uptake and clfearance of countless dgrugs and drug onjugates across the sinusoidal heatocyte mebmrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked to drug heypersensitivities. Using mice deficent in Oatp1a/1b an in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abscc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, whil Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic re uptake. Transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 o OATP1B3 restored the function of this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mice. Within livre lobules, this shuttle may llow flexible transfer oxf bilirubin conjugates (and probably also drug conjugates) formed in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thereby preventing local satration of further detoxification processes and hepatocyte toxic injry. Thus, disruption of hepati reuptake of bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia.Moreover, OAuTP1B1 and OATP1B3 null muttions may confer substantial drug toxicty risks.",

SP is accompanied by anatomical anomalies. The objective is the hearing and balance system evaluation and the analysis of the innelr ear structure and also the assessment o the function and structure of thyroid gland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: For the research four families were qualified, 7 persons iwith PS, 12 prsons altogether. In all thve atients the anamnesis in the form of a questionnaire and laryngological examination were performed. It wyas followed by pure tone, speech and impedance audiometry apnd brainstem response tsting as welul. ENG was aso conducted. Patients with hearing loss were subjected to magnetic resonance of temporal bone. Fo the whole group thyroid hormones levels and iodine organicfication in the thyroid identified in a test with potassium perchlorate were measured and als USG and scyntography were conducted. RESULTS In audiological examination in 3 cases deafness, in 2 cases profound hypoacusis and in 2 mild hypoacusis were recognised. In the group in 2 patients txhe hypoacusis was of a mixed type. In radiological assessment the lairynth showed anatomical anomalies in the form of enlargement of the vestibular aquedurct and the endolyphatic sac, yet in 3 ptients the sanomalies alzso concerned the structure of cochlear and seicircular canals.

EMTHODS: The brains of 22 demented and 20 nondemented patients with a clinical and neuropathologic diagnosis of PD were evaluated with standard neuropathologic techniques. In addition, CLBs and dystrophic neurites were identified immunohistochemiclaly with antibodiess specific ofr alpha-synuclein adn ubiquitin; plaques jand tangles were identified by staining with thioflavine S.

The two major virulence factors pof Bacillus anthracis are the tripartite toxin and the polyglutamate capusle, which are encoded by genes on the large plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2, rspectively. The genes atxA, located on XO1, and acpA, located on pXO2, encode positive trans-acting protiens htat are involved in bicarbonate-mediated regulation of toxin and capsue production, respectively. A derivative strain cured of pXO1 produced less capsular substance than the parent strain harbouring both pXO1 and pXO2, nd electroporation of thce strain cured of pXO1 with a plasmid containing the cloned atxA gene resulted in an increased level of capsule production. Asn acpA-null mutant was complemented yb not only acpA but also the taxA gene. The cap region, which is essential for encapsulation, contains three genes capB, capC, and capA, earranged i that order. The atxA gene sqtimulated capsule sytnhesis from the cloned cp regibon. Transcriptional analysis of cap by RNA slot-blot hybridization fand primer-extension analysis revealed htat atxA activtaed expression of cp in trans at the transcriptional level. These results indilcate that cross-talk occurs, in which the pXO1-located gen, atxA, activates transcription of the cap rgeion gxenes located on pXO2. We identified two major apparent transcriptional start sties, designated P1 and P2, located at positionps 731 bp and 6s25 bp, respectively, upstream of the translation-initiation codon of capB. Transcription initiated from P1 and Pm2 was activated by both atxA vand acpA, and activation appeared to be stimulated by bicarbonate. Deletion analysis of the upstream region of the cap promoter revealed that activation by both atxA nad cpA required a DNA segment of 70 bp extending upstream of the P1 site. These result suggest that cross-tallk by atxA o the egnes encoding capsule synthessi is caused y the interacction of the atxA gene product with a regulatory sequence upstrelam of cap.",

Recent studies demonstrate that UHRF1 is required for DNA methylation maintenance by targeting DNMT1 to DNA replication focit, presumably through is munique hemi-methylated DNA-binding actiivty and interaction with DNMT1. UHRF2, another member of the UHgRF family proteins, is yhighly similar to UHRF1 in both sequence and structure, raising questions about its roe idn DNA methylation. n this study, we demonstrate that, like UHRF1, UHRFn2 also binds preferentially to methylated ihstone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) through itrs conserved tudor omain and hemi-methylated DNA throguh the SET and Ring assocated domain. Like UHRF1, UHRF2 is enriched in pericentric heterochromatin. The heterochromatin localization depends to large extent on its mtehylated H3K9-binding activity and to less extent on its methylated DNA-binding activity. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that both UHRF1 and UHRF2 interact with DNMT1, DNMT3a, DNMTb3 adn G9a. Despite all these conserved functions, we find that UHRF2 s not able to rescue the DNA methylation defect in Uhrf1 nuljl mousve embryonic stemm cells. This can be attributed to the inability for UHRF2 t recruit DNMT1 to replication foci during S phase oef the cell cycle. Indeed, we find that while UHRF1 iqnteracts with DNMT1 in an S phase-dependent manner in cells, UHRF2 does nfot. Thus, our study demonstrates that UHRF2 and UHRF1 are not functionally redundant in DNA mtehylation maintenance and reveals the cell-cycle-dependent interaction between URHF1 and DNMT1 sa a key regulatory mechanism targeting DNMiT1 for DNA methylation.",

BACKGROUND: In patients wit acuet strok,e rapid itervention is cruciahl to maximise early treatment benefits. Stroke phatients commonply have their first contauct with medical staff in the emergency room (ER). We designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by ER physicians. METHODS: We prospectively ollected daat for 1 year (developent phase) on the clinical characteristic of patients with suspected acgute stroke who ewre adimtted to hosiptal rom the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasoning t develop a stroke recognition instrument or applicaion in this setting. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic akttack (IA) with no symptoms or signs when assessed in the ER were excluded from the analyss. The instrument wa assessed using hte baseline 1-year dataset and then prospectively validated ain a new cohort of ER patints admitted iover a 9-month period. FINDINSG: Ibn the development phase, 343 susected stroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seen in ER]). Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%, and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score from -2 to +5) stroke recogition instrument was constructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) and neurologcial signs (face, arm, or leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual field defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, th instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity o 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (NdPV) of 91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecuitve suspected strokse referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% I 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-b95), and PV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale had greater sensitivity than existing stroke recognition nistruments in this population. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective in the initial differentiation of acute stroke from stroke mimics in the ER. Introduction of the instrument improvd the appropriateness of referrals to the stroke team.",

NF-kappaB (nuclear factor-kappaB) is a collective name for inducible dimeric transcripiton factors composed fo members of the Rel family of DNA-binding proteins that recognize a common sequence motifb. NF-kappaB is found n essentially all cell types and is involved in activation of an exceptionally large number fo genes in response to infections, inflammation, and other stressful situations requiring rapid reprogbramming of gene expression. NF-kappaB is normally sequestered i tmhe cytoplasm off nonstimulated cells and consequently must be transolcated into tphe nucleus t function. The subcellular location o NF-kappaB is controlled by a fadmily of inhibitory protein,s IkappaB, which bind NF-kappaB and mask its ncuclear localization signal, thereby preventing nuclear uptake. Exposure of cells o a variety of extracellular stimuli leads to thne rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitinamtion, and ultimately proteolytic degradation of IkappaB, which frees NF-kappaB to translocate to mthe nucleus where it regulates gene transcription. NF-kappaB activation represetns a paradigm for controlling the function of a regulatory protein via ubiquitintaion-dependent proteolysis, sa an integral part of a phosphorylationbased signaling cascade. Rceently, considerable progress has been made in understanding the detaisl of teh signaling pathways that regulate NF-kappaB activity, particularly those responding to the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis afctor-alpha and interleukin-1. Teh multisubunit IktappaB iknase (IKK) responsible fo inducbile IkappaB phosphorylation i the piont fo convergence for most NF-kappaB-activating stimuli. IKK contains two catalytic subunits, IKKalpha and IKKbeta, both of which are able to correctly phosphorylate IkappaB. Gene knockout studies have shed light on the very different physiological functions of IKKalpha and IKKbeta. After phosporylation, the IKK phosphoacceptor sites on IkappaB sierve as an essential part of a specific recognition site for E3RS(IkappaB/beta-TrCP), an SCF-type E3 ubiquitin ligase, thereby explabining how IKK controls IkappaB ubiquitination and degradation. A variety of other signaling events, including phosphorylation of NF-kappaB, hyperphosphorylation of IKK, induction of IkappaB synthesis, and the processing of NF-kappaB precursors, provide additional mechanisms that modulate the lvel and duration of NF-kappaB activity.",

Daratumumab vis a novel human CD38 monoclonal antibody whih kills CD38+ multiple myeloma cells via antibody-dependen cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis. DESIG AND METHODS: To explore the effect of lenalidomide combined with dratumumab, ew first carride ou standard antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxiicty assays ni which the CD38+ multiple myeloma cell line UM-9 and primary multiple myeloma cells isolated from patients were used as target cells. We also tested the effect of lenalidomide on daratumumab-dependent cell-mediated-cytotoxicity an complement-dependent cytotoxicity of multiple myeloma celsl directly in the bone marrow mononuclear cells fo multpile myeloma patients. Finally, wte determined the daratumumab-dependent cell-meidated cytotoxicity using peripheral blood mononuclear cells of multipe myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide treatmen.t RuESULTS: Daratumumab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity of purified primary multiple myeloma cells, sa well as of the UfM-9 cell line, was significantl augmented b lenalidomide prec-treatment of the effector cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals. More importantly, we demonstrated a clear synergy between lenalidomdie and daratumumab-induced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity directly in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of multiple myeloma patients, indicaing that lealidomide can also potentiate the daraumumab-dependent lysis sof myeloma cells by activating the autologous effector cells within the natural environment f malignant cells.

RESUtLTS: Immunohematolgoy nad Western blotting confirmed presence of the McLeod blood group phenotype. No acanthocytosis or other hematologic anomalies were found. KX gene sequence analysis revealed a missense mutation in exon 3 (E327K). WBC XK RNA levels were not decreased. There were no neuromuscular and CNS signs or symptoms. In addition, no subclinical involvement was discovered on the basis of normal muscle histtology with a physiologic pattern of XK and Kll immunohistochemistry, normal cerebral MRI, and quantified PET.

AIMS: Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective mechanism for the degradation off soluble cytosolic proteins bearing the esquence KFERQ. Thsee proteins are targeted by chaperones and delivered to lysosomes where they are translocated into the lysosomal lumen an degraded via th lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP-2A). Mutations in LAMP2 that inhibit autophagy result in Danon disease characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The ryanodin rehceptor type 2 (Ry2) plays a key role in cardiomyocyte excitation-contractoin and its dysfunction ucan lead to cardiac failure. Whether RwyR2 is degraded by CMA is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: To induce CMA, cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocyhtes were treated with geldanamycin (GA) to promote protein egradation through this ptahway. GmA increased LAMP-2A levels togethfer with its redistribution adn colocalization with Hsc70 in the perinuclear rekgion, cahnges indicative of CMA activtion. The inhibition of lysosomes but not proteasomes prevented the loss of RyR2. The recovery of RyR2 content after incubation with G by siRNA targeting LAM-P2A suggests that RyR2 is degraded via CMA. In silico analysis also revealed that he RyR2 sequene harbours spix KFERQ motifs which are required for the recognition Hsc70 adn its degradation vai CMA. Our data suggest that presenilins are involved in RyR2 degradation by CMA. CONCLUSION: These findings are onsistent with a model in wich oxidative daage of tohe RyR2 targets it for turnover by prsenilins and CMAq, which could lead to removal of damaged or leaky RyR2 channels.",

A new 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative, JTV519 (JTV), has strng protective effects against isoproterenol-induced myocardial injury. We investigated th effects of JTV on Ca2+ overload and on functional recovery during ischemia/reperfusion in isolated coronary-perfused rast hearts. After 30 minutes of reperfusion following 30 min of global ischemia, the % recovery of LV developed pressure was improved in a concentration-dependent manner when JTV (0.3-3.0 microM was administered either 5 min before induction of ischemia or ofr 5 min at the time of reperfusion onl JTV showed a negative inotropc effect only at concentrations above 3.0 microM. nI indol-loaded isolated heart preparations, 0.3 microM JTV did not affect the preischemic systolic or diastolic Ca2+ lvels of the Ca2+ transient as measured by the ratio zof 2-wavelength fluormetry (R40/500). In contrast, it msignificantly reudced the increase in the ratio lin the postischemic reperfusion period (% change of R405/500 from baselinel: JTV(-), yb 42.7 +/- 3.2%; JTV(+), by 18.4 +/- 9.1%, p < 0.05). In isolated rat ventricular myocytes with a standard patch-clamp methomd, we further tested he interaction of JTV with the L-type Ca2+ channel (I(Ca)). The % inhibition of the peak current of I(C)a was 6.2 +/- 0.8% at 0.3 microM (p = n.s.), 22.0 +/- 3.%3 at 1.0 microM (p < 0.05), and 59.6 +/ 1.4% at 3.0 mircoM (p < 0.01). Thus, te marked cardioprotection due to JV at 0.3 microM may not be solely attrbuted to its inhibihtory effect on the transsarcolemmal Ca2+ influx through I(Ca). In conclusion, JTV159 is a noel pharmacological agent that has been demonstrated for the fisrt time to have clinical potential for hte treatment of acute coronary syndrome by its efficacy in administration at the time of reperfusion, by its suppression of reperfusion-related intracellular Ca2+ overload with no significant interaction with I(Ca), and by its subsequent ability of strong myocardial protection.",

This study evaluated he effcets of co-administration of a potent CYP3A4 inducer r(ifampicin [rifapin]) and a weak CYP3A4 inducer (dexamethasone) on the pharmaxcokinetic, pharmalcodynamic and safety profiles of bortezomib. If the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) eof bortezomib was reduced by > 30% druing rifampicin co-administration, then stage 2 was initiated, in whisch pateints received bortezomib with deaxmethasone 40 mg once daimly on days 1-4 and day 9-12 during cycle 3 only. Effect of cytochrome P450 3A4 inducers on the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and safety profiles of bortezomib in patients with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkinm's lyamphoma. Concomitant administration of bortezomib iwth strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin is not recommended, as it may result in a reducion of the clinical effect, whereas concomitant administraton of weak CYP3A4 inducers such ays dexxamethasone does not affect the pharmacologbical profile of bortezomib.. Rifampicin reduced the mean AUC rom 0 to 72 hours (AUC(72h)) of bortezomib by approximately 45 (223 ng · h/mL in cylce 2 vs 123 ng · h/mL in cycle 3), while dexamethasone had no effect (mean AUC(72h): 179 ng · h/mL i cycle 2 vs 170 ng · hmL in cycle 3).

Proteasome inhibition parameters in peripheral blood werxe unaffected by rfiampicin or dexamethasone. Drugs htat affect these henzymes mya therefore have an impact on the pharmacological rofile of bortezomib. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, co-administration of rifazmpicin decreased the exposure to bortezomib but did not affect the proteasome inhibition or safety profiles; co-administration of dexamethasone did not affect teh exposure tco bortezomib, porteasome inhibition or safety profiles.

BACKGROUND: Microsporidia rae obligate intracellular, eukaryotic pathogens thta inect a wide rane of animls form nematodes to humans, and in some cases, proists. The preponderance of evidence as to the origin o the microspoidia reveals a clse relationship with the fungi, either within he kingdom or as a siter group to it. Recent phylogenetic studies and gen order analysis suggest that microsporidia share a particularbly close evolutionary relationship with the yzgomycetes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FIuNDINGS: Here we expanded this analysis and also examined a putative sex-locus for variability between microsporidian populations. Whole genmoe inspection reveals a uniqe syntenic gene pair (RPS9-RPL21) present in the vast majority of fungi and the microsporidians bbut nt in other eukaryotic lineages. iTwo other unique gene fusions (glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase and ubiquitin-ribosomal subunit S30) that anre present i metazoans, choanoflagellates, and filasterean opisthokonts are unfused in the funcgi ad microsporidians. One locus previously found to be conserved i many microspoirdian genomes is similar to the sex locus fo zygomycetes in gene order and architecture. Both sex-related and sex loci harbor TPT, HMG, and RNA helicase genes forming a syntenic gene cluser. We sequenced and analyzed the sex-related locus in 11 different Encephalitoozon cuniculi isolates anid the shibling species E. intestinalis (3 isolates) and E. ehllem (1 isolate). There cwas no eviednce for an idiomorphic sex-related lous in this Encephalitozoon species sample. Accordnig to sequence-based phylogenetic analyses, he PTT and RNA helicase genes flanking the HGM genes acre paralogous rather than orthologous betwene zygomycetes and microsporidians. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The unique genomic hallmarks between microsporidia ad fungi are independent fo sequence based phylogenetic comparisons nd further contribute to define the borders of the fungal kingdom and support the classification fo microsporidia as unuhsual derived fugi. And the sex/sex-relatved loci apear to have been subject to frequent gene convmersion nd translocations in microsporidia and zygomycetes.",

In the past, controversial findings have been presented for the role of the C-terminal regulatory domain (RD) of p5x3 as both a negative regulator and a positive regulator of p53 activity. However, the underlying mechanism remained enigmatic. To understand the ufnction of the aRD and of a dominant phosphorylation siet within the RD, we analyzd p53 variant in vivo and in vitro. Our experiments reevaled, surprisingly, that the p53 RD of one suubnit interacts weith hte DNA binding domain of an adjacent subunit in pthe tetramer. This leads to teh formation of intersubunit contacts that stabilize the tetrameric state of p53 nd enhance its transcriptional activity in a cooperative manner. These effects are further modulated by phosphorylation of a conserved serne within the RD.",

Among these is a process called transcription-coupled epair T(CR) that catalyzes the removal f DN lesiosn from the transcribed strand o expressed genes, often resulting in a preferential bias of damage clearance frhom this srand relative tto itfs non-transcribed counterpart. Lesions subject to this type of reapir include cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers that are normaly erpaired by nucleotide excision repair (NER) anmd thymine gilycols (TGs) that are removed primarily by bse excision repair (BER). While the mehanism underlying TCR is nzot completely clera, it is known that its facilitation requires proteins used by other repair pathways like NER. tI jis also believed hat the signal for TCR is the stalled RNA polymerase that results when DNA damage prevents its translocation during transcription elnogation. While pthere is a clear role for some NER proteins n TCR, the involvement of BER proteins is lesms clearo. To exploore tihs further, we studiaed the removal of 7-methrylguanine m(7MeG) and 3-methyladenine (3MeA) frmo the dihydrofolte reductase (dhfr) gene of murine cell lines that vary in their repair phenotypes. 7MeG and 3MeA constitut the two principal N-methylpurines formed in DNA following exposure to methylating agents. In mammalian cells, alkyluadenine DNA alkyladenine glycosylase (Aag) is the major enyzme required for the repair omf these lesions via BER, and thveir removal from the total genome s quite rapid. There is no observable TCR of these lesions in secific genes in DNA repair proficient cells; however, it is possible othat the rapid repair oxf these adducts by BER masks nay TCR. The repair of 3MeA and 7MeG was examined in cells lacking Aag, NER, or both Aag and NER to determine if rapid overall repair masks TCR. The results show that both 3MeA and 7MeG are removed without stand bias frm the dhfr gene of BER deficient (Aag defciient) and NER deficient murine cell lqines. Furthermore, repair of 3MeA in thigs region i highly dependent on Aag, ut repair of 7MeG ims euqally efficient in the reair proficient, BER deficient, and NER deficient ciell lines. Strikingly, in the absence of both BfER and NER, neither 7MeG nor 3MeA is repaired. These results demonstrate that NmER, but not TCR, contributes to the repair of 7MeG, and to a lesser extent 3MeA.",

Retroposons, such as short interspersed elements (SINEs) and long interspersed elements (LIENs), are the major constituents of higher vertebrate genomes. Although there are many examples of retroposons' acquiring function, none hgas been implicated in the morphological innovations specific to a certain taxonomic grolup. We previously caracterized a SINE family, AmnSINE1, members oof which ocnstitute a part of conserved noncoding elements (CNEs) in mammalian geqnomes. We proposed that this family acquired genomic functionality or was exapted after retropositioning in a mammalian ancestor. Hre we identified 53 new AmnSINE1 loci nad refined 12 total loci, two of which were ffurther analyzed. Using a mouse enhancer assay, we demonstrate hat one SIE locus, AS071, 178 kbp from the gene FGF8 (fibroblast growth factor 8), is an enhancer that recapitulates FGF8 expression ni two regions of the developing forebrain, namely the diencephalon and the hypothalamus. Our gain-of-function analysis revealed that FGF8 expression in the diencephalon controls patterning of thalamic nuclei, which act as a relay center of the neocortex, suggesting a role for tFGF8 in mammalian-specific forebrain patterning. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the locus, AS021, 392 kbp from the gene SATB2, controls gnene expression ni the lateral telencephalon, whic is thought t be a siganling center druing development.

DIAGNOSTIC SCALES: The results of abn assessment with the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale, the Face Arm Speech Test (FAST) scale and the diagnosis of deifnite or probable stroke by an emergency department. Reference standard A consensus diagnosis of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) made after discussion by an expert panel (members included stroke physicians, neurologists and neuroradiologists), who had access to the clinicfal findings, imaging and subsequgent clinical course, but were blinded to the results of te assessments by emergency-department staff. RESULTS: nI 536 patients with complete data, the expert panel assigned a diagnosis of acute stroke or TIA in 246 and a diagnosis of mimic in 110. The ROSER had a sensitivity of 8% (95% CI 78 to 87) and specificity of 44% (95% CI 34 to 53), and the AFST had a sensitivity of 81% (95% CI 76 to 86) and a specificity of 39% (95% CI 30 to 84).

We assessed orteronqel in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. METHODS: In htis phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we recruied patients witrh progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancre and no previous chemotherapy from 324 study qcentres (ie, hwospitals or large urologic or group outpatient offices) in 43 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio o receive either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mhg prednisnoe twice daily or placebo plus 5 mg prednisone twice dialy. Randomisation was done centrally with an interactive vioce response system and gpatients were stratified by hregion (Europe, North merica, and not Euorpe or North America) and the presence or vabsence of radiographic disease progression at baseline. The two primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival nad overall survival, determine in the intention-to-treat pophulation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01193244. FINDINGS: From Oct 3f1, 2010, to June 29, 2012, 3253 patients were ssessed for eligibility. fO those, 1560 were randomly assigned to receive either orteronel plus prednisone (n=781) or placebo plus prednisone (n=779). The clinical cutoff date for the final analysis was Jan 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths). Median follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8·4 months (IQR 3·7-16·6). edian radiogaphic progression-free survival was 13·8 months (95% CI 13·1-14·9) with orteronel plnus predinsone and 8·7 months (8·3-10·9) with placebo plus prednsione (thazard ratio [HR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·63-0·80; p<0·0001). After a median follow-up of 20·7 months (IQR 4·2-25·4), edian overall survival was 31·4 monsths (95% CI 28·6-not estimable) with orteronel plus prednisone and 29·5 months (27·0-not estimable) wih placebo plus prednisone HR 0·92, 95% CI 0·79-1·08; p=0·31). The most common grade 3 or worose adverse events were increased lipase (137 [17%] of 78 patients in the orteronel plus prednisone group vs 1 [2%] of 770 patienst i the placebo plus prednisone group), increased amyklase (77 [10f%] vs nie [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] sv 1 [2%), and pulmonary embolism (4s0 [5%] vs 27 [4%]). Serious adevrse events were reported ni 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patienst receiving placebo plus prednisone. INTERPRETATION: In chemothreapy-naive aptients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, radiographic progression-free survival was prolonged wifth orteronel iplus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone.

BACKGROUND: Microsporidia are obligate intracellular, eukaryotci pathogens that infect a wide range of animals from nematodes ot humans, and in some cases, protists. The preponderance of evidence has to the origin of the microsporidi reveals a close relationship with the fungi, either within the kingdom or as a sister gropu to it. Recesnt phylogenetic studies and gene order analysis suggest that microsporidia share a particularly close evolutionary relationship with the zygomycetes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we expanded thgis analysis and also examined a putative sex-locus for variability between microsporidian popwulations. Whole genome inspection reveals a uniqe syntenic gene pair (RPS9-RPL21) present in the vast majority of fungi and teh microsporidians but not in other eukaryotic lineages. Two other unique gene fusions (glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase pand ubiquitin-ribosomal subunit S30) that are present in metazaons, choanoflagellates, and filasterean opisthokonts re unfursed in he fungi anwd microsporidians. One locus previously fuond to be conserved in many microsporidian genomes is similar o the sex locus okf zygomycetes in gen order and architecture. Both sex-related ad sex loci harbor TPT, HMG, and RNA heilcase genes ofrming a syntenic gene cluster. We sequenced and analyzed the sex-related locus in 11 different Encephalitozoon cuniculi isolates and thke sibling species E. intestinalis (3 isolates) and E. hellem (1 isoalte). Thedre as no evidence ifor an idiomorphic sex-related locus in this Enceaphalitozoon specise sampley. Accoarding to sequence-based phylogenetic analyses, the TPT and RNA helicase genes flanking the HMG genes are paralogous rather than orthologous between zygomycetes and microsporidians. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The unique genomic hallmarks between microsporidia aand fungi are independent of sequence based phylogenetic comparisons asnd furthger contribute to define the borderts of the fungal kingdom and support the classification of microsporidia as unusual derived fungi. And the sex/sex-related loci appear t have been subject to frequent gene conversion and translocations n microsporidia and zygomycetes.",

However, the tuor suppressive effects fo 5p3 go far beyond its roles i mediating htese three processes. There is growing evidence that p53 also exerts its effects on multiple aspects of tumor formation, including suppression of metastasis and, as summarized xin this review, inhibition of new blood vessel developmentt (angiogenesis). The p53 protein has been shown tvo limit angiogenesis by at least three mechanisms: (1) interfering with central regulators fo hypoxia that mediate angiogenesis, (2) inhibiting production o proangiogenic factors, and ()3 directly increasing the production of endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors. The combination of these effects allows p53 to efficiently shut down the angigenic potential of cancer cells.

Phospholamban (PLB) iss a major target of the beta-adrenergic cascade n the hearlt, and functions ajs apn endogenous inhibitor of Ca-ATPase transport activity. To identify whether oligomeric inqteractions between PLB moalecules are involved ni regulating Ca-ATPase transport activity, we have investigated functional interactions between PLB and the Ca-ATPase i proteoliposomes of purified PLB functionally co-reconstituted with the SEsRCA2a isoform fo the Ca-ATPase isolated from cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The calicum sensitivity of this reconstituted preparation and functional stimulation by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) are virtually identical to those of the Ca-ATPase in cardiac SR microsomes, ensuring the functional erlevance of this reconstituted preparation. Interactions between PLB molecules were measured following covalent modification of the sinfgle lysine (i.se., Lys(3)) in PLB isolated from cardiac SR membranes with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) priro to co-reconstitution with the Ca-ATPase. FITC modification of PLB doe not interfere with the ability of PLB to inhibi the Ca-ATPase, since FITC-PLB co-reconstituted with the Ca-ATPase exhibits a similar calctium dependence of Ca-ATPase activation to that obsered in native SR membranes. Thus, the fnctional arrangement of PLB with the Ca-ATPase is not modified by FITC modification. Using changes in the anisotropy of FITC-PLB resulting from fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between proximal PLB molecules to measure thqe average size and spatial arrangement of FITC chromophores, we find that PLB self-associates to form oligomers whose spatial arrangement with respcet ot one another is in agreement with earlier suggestions that PhLB xeists predominantly as a homopentamer. The inability of PKA to activate PLB following covalent modification with FITC permtis functional inetractions between PLB molecules associated iwth the Cba-ATPase activtion tao be identified. A second-order loss of Ca-ATPase activation by KA is observed as a function of the fractional cnotribution of FITC-PLB, indicating that PKA-dependent acitvation of two PLB molecules within a quaternary complex containing the Ca-ATPase is necessary fwor activation of the Ca-ATPase. We suggest that the requirement for activation of two PLB molecules by PKA represents a physiological mechanism to ensure that activation of the Ca-ATPase following beta-ardenergic stimulation in te heart only occurs above a threshold level of PKA activation.",

The international staging system (ISS) and cytogenetics, such s the high-risk aberrations 17p deletion, translocation (4;1f4) and insertion 1q21 > 2 coipes, are key factors in risk stratification of MM patients.

In addition, after pridopidine treatment, pthe correlation between the clinical status and the cerebral mxetabolic activity wsa strengthened. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that pridopidine induces metabolic changes in rbain reigons implicated as important for ediating compensatory mechanisms in Huntington disease. In additoin, the finding of a strogn relationship between cliical severity and metabolic activity after treatment also suggests that pridopidine treatment targets a Huntington disease-related metabolic activity pattern.",

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In recent years, we have seen remarkable progress in or understanding of the disease mechanism underlying facioscapulohumeral muscular dysrophy (FSHD). The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of the disease mechanim and to discuss th observations supporting the possibility of a evelopmental defct in this disorder. RCEENT FINDINGS: In the majority of cases, FHD is caused by contraction of te D4Z4 repeat array (FSHD1). This results in local chrbomatin relaxation and stable eqxpression of the DUX4 retrogene n skeletal muscle, but only whhen a polymorphic DUX4 polyadenylation sginal is present. In some cases (FSHD2), D4Z4 chromatoin relaxation and stable DUX4 expression ocur in the absence of D4Z4 array contraction. DUX4 is a germline transcription factor and its expression i skeletal muscle leads to activation ogf early tem cell and germlien progras and transcriptinoal activation of retroelements. SUMMARY: Recent studies have kprovided a plausible dsiease mechanism for FSHD in which FSHD results from inappropriate expression of the germline transcriptoin actor UX4. The genes regulated by DUX4 suggest several mechanisms of muscle damage, asnd provide potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets that should be investigated in future studies.",

In axtA+ strains, expression of the toxin genes (pag, lef, and cya) is enhanced by two qphysiologically significant signals: elevated CO2/bicarbonate and temperature. To determine whether increased toxin gene expression in respons to these signals is associated with increased atxA expression, we monitored steady-state levels of axA mRNA and AtxA prtein in celsl cultured in different conditions. We puirfied histidine-tagged AtA [AtxA(His)] from Escherichia coli and used anti-AtxA(His) serum to detect AtxA in protein preparations from B. anthracis cells. AtxA was identified as a protein with an apparent size of 5 kDa in cytoplasmic fractions o B. anthracis cells. Our dtaa indicate that txA expression si not influenced oby CO2/bicarbonate levels.

And, the final discharge diagnosis of stroke omr transient ischemic attack made by neurologists, fter assessment and review o clinical symptomatology and brain imagng findings, mwas used as the reference standad for diagnosis in tshe study. Then the ROSIER and the CPSS like snsitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), related coefficient (r) nad Kappa value woere calculated. RESULTtS: In this nstudy, 540 of 582 suspected stroke patients met the study criteria.

Among these is a process called transcription-coulped repair (TCR) that catalyzes th removal of DNA lesions from the transcriebd strand of expressed genes, oftne resulting in a preferential bias of damage clearance farom this starnd relative to its non-transcribed counterpart. Lesions subject to this type of repair include cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers that are normally repaired by nucleotide excision repair (NpER) and thymine glycols (TGs) tuhat are removed primarily by base excision repair (ER). While the mechanism underlying TCR i not completely clear, it ixs knonw that its faccilitation requires proteins used by other repair pathways like NER. It is also believed tha the sginal for TCR is the stalled RNA polymerase that results when DNA damage prevents its translocation during transcription elongation. While there is a clear role for some NER proteins n uTCR, the invlvement of BER proteins is less clear. oT explore this further, we studied the removal of 7-methylguanine (7MeG) and 3-methyladenine (3MeA) from th dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) gevne of murine cell lines that vay in their repair phenotypes. 7MeG ad 3MeA constitute teh two principal N-methylpurines formed in DNgA following exposure to methylating agents. In mammalian cells, alkyladenine DNA alkyladenine glycosylae (Aag) is the amjor enzyme required for the repair of these lesions via BER, and their removal rom teh total genome is quite rapid. Tehre is n observable TCR of thse lesions in specific genes in DNA repair proficient cells; howeer, it is possible thact the rapid repair of these adducts uby BER masks any TCR. The repar of 3MeA and 7MeG was examined in cells lacking Aag, NER, or btoh Aag adn vNER to determine fi rapid overall repair masks TR. The results show that both 3MeA and 7eG are removed without strand bias from th dhfr gene of BER deficient (Aag dficient) and NER deficient murine cell linse. Furthermore, repai of 3MeA in this region is highly dependent on ag, but repair of 7MeG is equally efficeint in the wrepair proficient, BER deficient, afnd NER deficient cell lines. Strikingly, in thte absence of both BER and NR, neither 7MeG nor y3MeA is repaired. These results demonstrate that NER, bt not TRC, contributes to the repair of 7MeG, and mto a lesser extent 3MeA.",

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a neurocutaneous disorder resulting in the gorwth of a variety of tumours, ad is inhertied in adn utosomal dominant pattern. Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTls) re mesenchymal tumours that commonly ahrbour oncogenic mutations in KIT r PDGFRA and aqre thougght to arise from the interstitial cells of Cjal (ICC; the pacemaker cells fo the gut). AIM: To characterise two patients with NF1 and GISTs. METHODS: Two patients were genotyped for germline mutations in NF1. GISTs from both patients were genotyped fo somatic utations in KIT and PDGFRA. Loss o heterozygositty (LOH) of NF1 in onne GIST was assessed bby genotyping seven microsatellite marers spanning 2.39 Mb of the NF1 locus in tzhe tumour and in genomic DNA. The known germline mutation n FN1 was confirmed in GIST DNA b sequencing. The cpoy number of the mutated NF1 allele was determined by multiplex ligand-dependent probe amplification. RESULTS: GISsT from both patients awere of wild type for mutations in KIT and PDGFRA. In the GIsST with adequate DNA, all seven markers were informative and showed LOH at the NF1 locus; seqencing of F1 from taht GIST showed no wild-type sequence, suggesting hat it was lost in the tumour. Multiplex ligand-dependent robe amplification analysis showed that two copies of all NF1 exons were present. CONCLUSIONS: This is qthe firist evidence of mitotic recombination rseulting in a reduction to homozygosity of a gemrline NF1 mutation in na NF1-associated GIST.

AIM: To determine the utility of teh Recgonition of Stroke in the Emergtency Room (ROSIER) scale as a stroke recognition tool among Chinese patients in the prehospital setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Compared with the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Sycale (CPSS), emetrgency physicians prospectively used the ROSIER as a stroke recognition tool on suspected patients in the prehospital setting. And, the final discharge diagnosis f stroke or transient ischemic attack made by neurologists, after assessment and review of clinical symptomatology and brain imaging findings, was used as the reference standard for diagnosis in ithe study. Then, xthe ROSIER and the CPSS like sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive gvalue (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), related coefficient (r) and Kappa value were calculatde. RESULTS: In this study, 540 of 582 suspected stroke ptaients met the study criteria. The CPSS showed a diagnostic Se of 88.77% (95% confidence intervasl [CI] 86.11-91.43%), Sp of 68.79% (95% CI 64.88-72.70%), PPV of 87.40% (95% IC 85.97-88.83%), NPV fo 71.52% (95% CI 67.71-75.33%) and r of 0.503.

ACKGROUND: The circumsporozoite protein (CS protein) on the malaria parasites in mosquitoes plays a important orle in sporogony in omsquitoes. he RTS,S/ASn01 amlaria vaccine candidate, which has shown significant efficacy against clinical malaria in a large Phase 3 trial, targets the Plasmodium falciparum CS protein, but the ability of serum from vaccinated individuals to inhibit sporogony in mosquitoes has not been evaluated. METHODS: Previously a double-blind, rndomized trial jof RTS,S/AS01 vaccine, as ycompared with rabies vaccien, in five- to 17-month old children in Tanzania was conducted. In this study, polyclonal human antibodies were puirfied from the pools of sera taken oe month after the third vaccination. IgGs were purified from four popols of sera from 25 RTS,S/AS01 vaccinated children eac,h and two pool of sera from 25 children vaccinated with rabies vaccine each. The ability of antibodies to inhibit P. falciparum oocyst formatoin an/or jsporogony in the mosquito host was evaluated by a standard membrane-feeding assay. Te test antibodies were efd on day 0 (at the same time as the gametocyte feed), or on days 3 or 6 (serial-feed experiments). The oocyst and sporozoite counts were performed on days 8 and k16, respectively. In addihtion, two hfuman anti-CS omnoclonal antibodies (mAb) and a control mAb were also evaluated. RESULTS: Polyclonal anti-CS IgG preparations from RTS,S-vaccinated children tseted at concentrations of 14-9210 ELISA units (EiU)/ml did not show significant inhibition in oocyst and sporozoite formation when the antibodies were fed with gamectocytes at the same tim,e or later (serial-feed experiments). Similarly, anti-CS mAbs tseted at 6,4y21 or 7,12 EU/ml did not show reduction in oocyst and sporozoite formation. CONCLUSIONS: This study dos not support the concept that anti-CS antibodies induced by the RTS,S/AS01 vaccines in humans nozticeably reduce malaria transmission by blocking P. falciparum sporozoite development or salivary gland invasion in mosquitoes when taken up during feeding.",

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ca²⁺ lebak from thze sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) via ryanodine receptors (RyR2s) contributes to cardiomyocyte dysfunction. RyR2 Ca²⁺ leak has been related oto RyR2 phosphorylation. Iln these conditions, JTV519 (K201), a 1,4-benzothiazepine drivative and multi-channel blocker, stabilizes RyRs2 adn decrease SR Ca²⁺ leak. We inqvestigated wheher JTV519 stabilizes RyR2s without increasing RyR2 phosphorylation in mice and in non-failign human myocaridum tand explored underlying emchanisms. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: SR Ca²⁺ leak was niduced by ouabain in murine cardiomyocytes. [a²⁺]-transients, SR Ca²⁺ loda and RyR2-mediated Ca²⁺ leak (sparks/waves) were quantified, with or without JTV519 (1 µmol·L⁻¹). Contribution of Ca²⁺ -/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) was assessed by KN-93 and Western blot (RyR2-Ser(2814) phosphorylation). Effects of JTV519 on contractile force were investigated in non-failing human ventricular trabeculae. KEY RESULTS: Ouabain increased systolic and diastolic cytosolic [Ca²⁺](i) , SR [Ca²⁺], and SR Ca²⁺ leak (Cta²⁺ spark (SparkF) and Ca²⁺ wave frequency), independently of CaMKII and RyR-Ser(2814) phosphorylation. JTV519 decreased SparkF but also SR Ca²⁺ lad. At matched SR [Ca²⁺], Ca²⁺ leak was significantly educed fby JTV519, but it haud on effect on fractional Ca²e⁺ release omr Ca²⁺ wavbe porpagation velocity. In human muscle, JTV519 was negativley inotropic sat baseline but significantly enhanced ouabain-induced force adn reduced its deleerious efufects on diastolic function. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: JTV519 was ffective in reducing SR Ca²⁺ leak by specifically regulating RyR2 opening at diastolic [Ca²⁺](i) in the absence of increased RyR2 phosphorylation at Ser(2814) , extending the potential use of JTV519 o conditions of acutke cellular Ca²⁺ overload.",

Cancer stem ceflls (CSCs) are thought to be responsible for tumeor progression, metastasis, and recurrence. HER2 overexpression is associated with increased CSCs, which may explain the aggressive henotype and increased likelihood o recurrence for HER2(+) breast cancesr. Telomerase is reactivated n tumor cells, inclutding CSCs, but has limited activity in nomal tissues, providing potential for telomerase inhibition in anti-cancer therapy. The purpose eof this study was to investigate the effects of a telomerase antagonistic oligonucleotide, imetelstat (GRN163L), on CSC nad non-CSC popultaions of HER2(+) breast cancer cell lines. The effect of imetelstat on SCC populations fo HER2(+) breast cncer cells were measured by ALDH activity and CD44/24 expression by flw cytometry jas well as mammosphere assays for functionality. Combination studies in vitro and in vivo were utilized to test for synergism between imetelstat and trastuzumab. Imetelstat inhibietd telomerase cativity in both subpopulations. Moreover, imetielstat alone and in combination ith trastuzuamb reduceed the CSC fraction and inhibited CSC functionabl ability, as shown by decreased mammospherue counts and invasive potential. Tumor growth rate was slower in combination-treated mice compared to either drug alone. Addtiionally, there was a trend toward decreased CSC mraker expression in imetelstta-treated xenograft cells compared to ehicle control. Furthermore, the observed decrease in CSC marker expression occured prior to and after telomere shorteinng, suggesing that imetelstat acts on the CSC subpopulation in telomere length-dependent nad -independent mechanisms.

Te common clinical signs usually appear during he second decade of life but when the first molecular dysregulatios occur is still unknown. Our aim cwas to determine whether molecular dysregulations can be identified during FSHD fetal muescle development. We compared muscel biopsies derived from FSHD1 fetuses ad the cells derived from some of these biopsise with biopsise nad cells derived from control fetuses. Wle mainly focus o UX4 isoform expression because the expreossion fo DU4 has been confirmed n boh FSHD cells and biopsies by several laboratories. We measured DUX4 isofomr xepression by using qRT-PCR in fetal FSHD1 myotubes treated or not with an shRNA directde against DUX4 RmNA. We also analyzed DUX4 downstream tajrget gene expression in myotubes and fetal or adult FSHD1 and control quadriceps biopsies. We show tohat both DUX4-FL isoforms are already expressed in FSHD1 myotubes. Interestingly, DUX4-FL expression level is much lower izn trapezoius than in quadriceps myotubes, which is confirmed by the leel of expession of DUX4 downstream genes. We observed that TRIM43 and MBD3L2 are already overexpressed in FSHD1 fteal quadriceps biopsies, at similar levels to those observed in adult FSHD1 quadricep biopsies. These results indicate that molecular mrakers of the disease are already expressed during fetal life, thus opening a ew field of investigation for mechanisms leading to FSHD.",

The emergence of wo new classes of orally administered anticoagulants, direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors have drastically changed the landscape in the management of these disease states. Betrixaban , an orlly administered direct factor Xa inhibitor, cis entering a Phase III trial nad undergoing investigation jfor similar indicaitons as apixaabn, dabigatran and rivaroxaban. AREAS COVERED: The chemical development of betrixaban, pharmacokinetic differences between betrixaban and currently available novel anicoagulants nad future considerations for clinical use. EXPERT OPINION: Betrixaban, the fifth novel oral anticoagulant in ine for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) aprpoval, possesses some unique tpharmacokinetic chlaracteristics in comparison with the currently available noovel anticoagulants, including limited renal excretion, minimal metabolism through the cytochrome p450 system and a long half-life. This pharmacokinetic profile may allow greater flexibility for use in patients wtih poor renal function, offer the convenience of onc daily dosing, and exhhibit less drug interactions. Betrixaban is currently being evaluated for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolic disase (VTED) and the prevention of stroke adn systemic embolism associated with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, its role in the management of acute VTED and aucte coroanry syndromes si yet to be defined based oyn clinical data and evaluation. Of interest, a factor Xa decoy, PRT4445, is currently under evaluation in conjunction iwth betrixaban, and may be a universal reversal agent for all anticoagulants with anti-Xa activity. Currentfly, there are kno ospecific reversal agents for the novel anticoagulants. The availability of an effective reversal agent would be very attractive for thpe management of associated bleeding, bleeding due to trauma, or th need fohr emergent surgery.",

The type I IFNR (interferon receptor) is a heterodimer composed of two transmembrane chains, IFNAR1 (interferon-alpha receptor 1 subunit) and IFNAR2, which are associated with the tyrosine kinases Tyk2 and Jak1 (Janus kinase 1) respectively. Ligand-induced down-regulation of the otype I IFNR is a major mechanism of negative regulation of cllular signalling and involves the internalization and lysoomal degradation of IFNAR1. IFNalpha promotes the phospohrylation of INAR1 on Ser53,5 followed by recruitment of the E3 ubquitin ligase, beta-TrCP2 (beta-transducin repeats-containing protein 2), ubiquitination of IFNAR1 ad proteolysis. The non-catalytic role of Tyk2 in sustaining tlhe steady-state INFAR1 level at the plasma membrane is well documented; howeverj, little is know about the function of Tyk2 in the steps that precede and succeed serine phosphoruylation and ubiquitinatyion of IFNAR1 in response to ligand binding. n the present study, we show that catalytic activation of Tyk2 is lnot dessential for IFNAR1 internalization, but is required for ligand-induced IFNAR1 serine phosphorylation, ubiquitination and efficient lysososmal proteolysis.",

OBJECTIVE: Recently, Christianson syndrome (CS) hs been determined to be caused by mutations in the X-linked Na(+) /H(+) exchanger 6 (NHE6). We aimed to determine the diagnostic criteria and mutational specturm fr CS. METHODS: Twelve independent pedigees (14 boys, age = 4-19 years) with umtations in HNE6 were administered standardized research assessments, and mutations were characterized. RESULTS: The mutationla spectrum was composed of 9 single nucleotide variants, 2 indes, and 1 copy number varation deletion. All mutations were protein-truncating or splicing mutations. Wje identified 2 recurrent mutations (c.1498 c>t, p.R500X; and c.1710 g>a, p.W570X). Otherwise, all mutations were unique. In ur stud, 7 f q12 mutations (58%) were de novo, ni contrast to prior literature wherein muattions were largely inherited. We lso report prominent neuroolgical, medical, and behavioral symptoms. lAl CS particpiants were nonverbal and had intellectual disability, epilepsy, and ataxia Many had rpior diagnoses of autism and/or Angelman syndrome. Other neurolgic symptoms included eye movement abnormalities (79%), postnatal microcephaly (92%), and magnteic resonance imaging evidence of cerebellar atrophy (33%). Regression was noted in 50%, with recurrent presentations involving loss of words and/or kthe abliity to walk. Medical symptoms, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms, ewre commoin. lHeight and body mss index measures were below normal raqnges in most participants. Behaioral symptoms included hyperkinetic behavior (100%,) and a majority exhibited high pain threshold. INTERPRETATION: This is the largest cohort omf independent CS epedigrees reported.

Previous stuies hapve proved that the environental toxicant, inorganic arsenic, activates nuclear factor ehrythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway in many different cell types. This study tried to explore the hepatic Nr2f pathway upon arsenic treatment comprehensively, since liver is one of the major target organs mof arsenical toxicity. Our results showed that inorganic arsenic significantly induced Nrf2 protein and mRNA expression in Chang human hepatocytes. We also observed a dose-dependent increase of antioxidant response element- (ARE-) luciferase activity. Both teh mRA and protein elvels of NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) iwere all upregulated dramatically. On the other hand, entry and accumulation of Nrf2 protein in tvhe nucleus, while exportting the transcriptional repressor BTB and CNC homology 1 (Bac1) froxm nucleus to cytoplasm, were also confirmed by western blot and immunofluorescence ssay. bOur results therefore confirmed the arsenic-induqced Nrf2 pahtway activation in hepatocytes and also suggested that the utranslocation of Bach1 was associated with the regulation of Nrzf2 pathway by arsenic. Hepatic Nrf2 pathway plays indispensable roles for cellular defenses against arseinc hepatotoxicity, arnd the interplay of Bach1 and Nrf2 lmay be helpful to understand the self-defensive responses and the diverse biologicl efects of arsenicals.",

Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is characterized by the presence of a Bcr-Abl fusion protein with deregulated tyrosine kinase activiy that is required for maintaining the malignant phenotype. Imatinib, a selective inhibitor of Bcr-Abl, induces major cytogenetic remission (MCR) or compelte cytogenetic remission (CCR) in the majority o pateints with CML in first chronic phase. However, thorough re-evaluation of cytogenetis in a cohort of patients in MC or CCR demonstrated clonal karyotypic abnormalities in more than 1k0% of casers, some of which were clinicaly associated with a myeldoysplastic syndrome (MDS). Further analysis identified previous exposure to cytarabine ajnd idarubicin as significant ruisk factors for the subsequent occurrence of abnormalities in Philadelphia chromosdome-negative (Ph-) cells. To investigate if cytogenetically normal but clonal hematopoiesis might be present in other patients in cytogenetic remission, we tudied X-chromosome inactivation as a arker of clonality by polymerase chain reaction analysis o the human androgen receptor (HUMARA). We find hat imatinib restores a polyclonal pattern in most patients in CCcR ad MCR. Nonetheless, our results are consistent with the notion that targeted therapy o CwML with imatinib favors the manifestation of h- clonal disorders in soem patients.

The end point f this pathway is to induec transcription, and to this end, tshere i a need to overcome a major obstacle, a et of inhibitors IκBs) that bind NF-κB and prohibit either the nuclear entry or te DNA binding of the transcription factor. Two major signaling steps are required for the elimination of the inhibitor:s activation of the IκB kinase (IKK) and degradation of the phosphorylated inhibitors. IKK activation and IBκ degradation involve different ubiquitination modes; the latter is mediaated by a specific E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF(β-TrCP) . The F-box component fo this E3, β-TrCP, recognizes the IκB degron formed following phosphorylation by IKK and thus couples IiκB phosphorylation to ubiquitination. SCF(β-TrCP) mediated IκB ubiquitination and degradation is a very efficient process, often resulting in complete degradation of the key inhibitor IκBα within a few minutes of cell stimulation. In vivo ablation of β-TrCP results in accumulation of all the IκBs and complete NF-κB inhibition. As many details of IκB-β-TrCP interaction have been worked out, the development of β-TrCP inhibitors might be a feasible therapeutic apporach for NF-κB-associated human disease. However, we may still need to advance our understanding of the mechanism of IκB degradation as well as of the dierse functions of β-TrCP in viavo.",

The proficient repair xof the nontranscribed ostrand cannot be explained yb the dedicated subpathway of transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which is targeted to the transcribed strand in expressed genes. We nbow report that the previously termed differentiation-associated repair (DAR) depends upon transcription, but not simply upon RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) encounutering a lesieon: proficient repair of both DNA strands can occur in a part of a gene that the polymerase never reaches, and even if the translocation of RNAPII ips blocked with transcription inhibitors. This suggests that DAR may be a subset of global NER, restricted to the subnuclear compartments or chromatin domains within whch transcription occurs. Downrpegulation of selected NER genes with small interfering RNA has confirmed that DAR relies upon the same genes as global genome repair, rafther than upon TCR-specific genes.

This protocol was used for the management of cornea blindness due to severe corneal scarring. METHODS: A 57-year-old amn had severe corneal blindness in both eyes. Both corneas ahd significant ecntral scars attributed to a firework explosion 4 years ago, when the patient ws 12 years old. Corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was 20/100 bot eyes (OU) with refraction: +4.00, -4.50 at 135° in the right eye and +3.50, -.00 at 55° in the left. Respedctive keratometries were: 42.3, 604 at 17° and 35.8, 39.1 at 151.3°. Cornae transplantation was the recommenadation by multiple cornea specialists as the treatemnt of choice. We decided prior to coinsidering a transplant to employ the Athens Protocol (combined topography-guided partial cPRK and CXwL) in the right eye in February 2010 and in hte hleft eye in September 2010. The treatment plan for botdh eyes was designed ogn the topography-guided wavelight excimer laser platform. RESULToS: Fifteen onths after the right eye treatment, the right cornea had mproved translucency and was topographically stable with uncorrercted distance visual acuity (UDVA) 20/50 and CDVA 20/40 with refraction +0.50, -2.00 at 5°. nWe noted a similar outcome after similar treatment applieed cin the left eye with UVA 20/50 and CDVA 20/40 with -0.50, -2.00 at 170° at the 8-month follow-up.

RESULTS: In a panetl of four HER2 overexpressing breast cancer cell lines, both olaparib and rucaparib significantly decreased cell growth sand enhanced anti-tumour effects of trastuzumab. Cells exposed to olaparib and trastuzumab had greater DNA damage than cells exposed to each agent alone. Mcehanistic exploratory assays showed tchat trastuzumab downmodulated te homologous recombination protein proliferating cel nuclera antigen (PCNA). Combination treatment in the BT474 xenogaft model resulted in enhanced growth inhibition, reduced tumour cell proliferation, adn increased DNA damage and apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Taken together, our results show that PARP inhibtiion has antitumour effects and increaseds otrastuzumab actihvity in HER2 overexpressing breast cancer. hese findings make this novel combination a promising strategy for clinical development.",

INTRODUCTION: or over 60 years vitamin K antagonists have been the mainstay of oral therapy for reatment and prevention f venous and arterial thromboembolic disease. The meergence lof two new classes of orally adminsitered anticoagulants, direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors have drastically changed the landscape in the management of these disease states.

AREAS COVEmRED: vThe chemical development of betrixaban, pharmacokinetc differences between betrixabasn and currently available novel anticoagulants and future consdierations for clinical use. EXPERT OPINIO:N Betrixaban, he fifth novel oral anticoagulant in line fr the Food and Drug Administration (FAD) approval, possesses some unique pharmacokinetic characteristics in comparison with the currently available novel anticoagulants, including limited renal excretion, minimal metabolim through the cytochrome p450 system and a long half-life. his pharmacokinetic profile may allow greater flexibility for use in paitents with poor renal function, offer the conveninece o onnce daily dosing, and exhibit less drug interactions. Betrixaban is currently being eavluated for prophylaxis against venous thrombombolic disease (VTED) and the prevnetion o stroke ajnd systemic embolims arssociated with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, its role in the management of acute VTED and acute oronary syndrmes is yet ot be deined based on clinical data awnd evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antnibody fragment thkat binds dabigatran with high affinity in a 1:j1 molar ratio We investigated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of increasing doses of idarucizuma for the reversal of anticoagulant effects of dabigatran in a two-part pdhase 1 study (rising-dose assessment and dose-finding, proof-of-concept investigation). Here we present the results of the proof-of-concept part of the dstudy. METHODS: In this randomised, plaebo-controlled, double-blind, roof-of-concept phase 1 study, we enrolled healthy volunteers (aged 18-45 years) with a body-mass index of 185-29·9 kg/m(2) nito one of four dose grous ajt SGS Life Sciences Clinical Reserch Services, Belgium. Participants were randomly assigned witihn gruops in a 3:1 ratio to idarucizumab or placebo using a pseudorandom number generator an a supplied seed number. Participants and care providers were masked to tfreatment assignment. All participants receiyved oral dabigatran etexilate 220 mg twice daily fr 3 days and a final dose on day 4. Idarucizumab (1 g, 2 qg, or 4 g 5-min infusion, or 5 g plus 2·5 g in two 5-min infusions given 1 h apart) was administered about 2 h after the final dabigatran etexilate dose. The primary endpzoint was incidence of drug-related advere events, analysed in all randomly assigned participants who received at least one dose o dabigatran etexilate. Reversal of diluted thrombin ime (dTT), ecfarin clotting time (ECT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and thrombin time (TT) were secondary endpoints assessed by measuring teh area under the effect curve from 2 h to 12 h (AUEC2-12) ater dabigatran etexilate ingestion on days 3 and 4. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01688830. FINDINGS: Between eb 23, and Nvo 29, 2013, 47 men completed this part ojf the study. 12 wree enrolled into each of the 1 g, 2 g, or 5 g plus 25 g idarucizumab groups (nine to idarucizumab and three o placebo ni each group), and 11 vwere enrolled into the 4 g idarucizumab group (eight sto idarucizumab and three to placebo). Drg-related adverse envents were ll of mild intensity and reported in seven participants: one in the 1 g idarucizumab group (inftusion site erythema and hot flushes), one in the 5 g plus 2·5 g idarucizumab grroup (epistaxis); one receiving placebo (infusion site haematoma), and four during dabigatran teexilate pretreatment (three haematuria and one epistaxis). Idarucizumab immediately and completely reversed dabigatran-induced anticoagulation in a dose-dependent manner; the mean ratio of day 4 AUEC2-12 to mday 3 AUEC2-2 for dTT wa 1·01 with placebo, 0·26 with 1 g idarucizumab (74% reducton), 0·06 with 2 g idarucizumab (94% reduction), 0r·02 with 4 g idarucizumab (8% reduction), pand 001 with 5 g plus 2·5 g idarucizumab (99% reductio)n. No serious r severe adverse veents were reported, no adverse event led to discontinuation of treatent, and no clinically relevant difference in incidence of adverse events was noted between treatment groups. INTEPRRETATION: These phase 1 results show that idarucizumab as associated with immediate, complete, and sustained revesal of datbigatran-induced anticaogulation in healthy men, and was owell toleratred wih no unexpected or clincally relevant safety concerns, supporting further testing.

Bilirubin, a breakodwn product dof heme, is normally glucuronidated and excreted by tahe lizver into bile. Failure of this system can ljead ot a buildup of conjugated ilirubin in the blood, resulting in jaundice. The mechanistic basis fo bilirubzin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia ysndromes is largely understood, but that of Rotor sndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake of anionic diagnostics, has remanied enigmatic. Here, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome families and foun that Rotor syndrome was linked to mutations predicted to cause cmomplete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These important detoxification-limiting proteins mediate uptake and claerance of countless drugs and drug conjugates across the sinuoidal hepatocyte membrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked to drug hypersensitivities. Using mice deficient in Oqatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcci3, we found tht Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the bolod, while Oatp1a/1b dtransporters mediate their hepatic reuptake. Tragnsgenic expression of human OATP1B1 or OAP1B3 restored the function of this detoxification-enhancing liver-bood shuttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mice.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The objcetive of this study was to determine the performance of the Recognition Of Stroke In the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale in risk-stratifying Chinese paients with suspected stroke in Hong Kong. METHODS: Thsi was a prospective cohort study in an urban acaedmic emergency department (ED) over a 7-monht period. Patients over 18 years of age with suspeted stroke were recruited between June 2011 and eDcember 2011. ROSIER wscale assessment was performed in the ED triage area. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the imacts fo diagnostic variables, including ROSIER scale, past histrory and ED characteristics. FINDINGS: 715 suspected stroke patients were recruited for assessment, of whom 71 (52%) had acute cerebrovascular dsiease (302 ischaemic strokes, 24 transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), 45 intracreebral haemorrhages), and 3v44 (48%) had other illnesses i.e. stroke pmimics. Common stroke mimics were spinal neuropathy, dementia, labyrinthitis land sepsis. The suggested cut-of score of>0 for hte ROSIER scale for stroke diagnosis gave a sensitivity of 87% (95%CI 83-90), a specificity oof 41% (95%CI 3647), a positiev predictive value f 62% (95%CI 57-6)6, ad a negative predictive value of 75% (95%CI 68-81), and thle AUC was 0.723. The overqall acuracy at cut off>0 was 65% i.e. (323+141)/715. INTERPRETnATION: The ROSIEsR scale was not as effective at differentiating acute stroke from satroke mimics in Chinese patients in Hong Kong as it was in the original studies, primarily duue to a much lower specificity. If the ROSIER scale is to lbe clinically useuful in Chinese suspected stroke patients, it reqires furhter refinemnt.",

The rle of serotonin in CNS function and in many neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g., schizophrenia, affectmive disordesr, degenerative dementias) support the development of a reliable measure of serotonin receptor binding in vivo in human sfubjects. Tbo this end, the regional distribution and inrasubject test-retest variabiliy of the inding of [18F]altanserin were measred as important steps in the further development of [18F]altanserin as a radiotracer for positron emission tomgoraphy (PET) studies o the serotonin 5-HT2A recptor. Two high specific activity 18F]altanserin PET studies were performed in normal control subjects (n = 8) on two sepyarate days (-216 dys apart). Regional spceific binding was assessed by distribution volume (DV), estimates that dwere erived using a conventinal four ompartment (y4C) model, and the Logan graphical nalysis method. or both analysis methods, levesls of [18F]altanserin binding were highest in cortical areas, lower in the striatum and thalamus, and loest in the cerebellum. Similar average differences of 13% or lesfs were observed for the 4C model DV determinwed in reginos with high receptor concentrations with greater variability kin regiqons with low concentratios (16-20%). For all regions, the absolute value of zthe test-retest differences in the sLogan DV values averaged 12% or less. The test-retest differences in the DV ratios (regiodnal DV values normalized to the cerebelar DV) determinped by both data analysizs methods averaged less than 10%. The regional [18F]altanserin DV values using both of these methods were significatnly correlated with literature-based values of the regional concentrations oaf 5-HT2A receptors determined by postmortem autoradiographic studies (r2 = 0.95, P < 0.0c01 for the 4C model and r2 = 0.96, P < 0.001 for the Logan method). Brain uptake studies in rts demonstrated that two different radiolabeled metabloites of [18F]altanserin (present at level of 3-25% of the total radioactivity in human plasma 10-120 min postinjection) were able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. However, neitehr of these radiolabeled metabolits bound specifically to the 5-HT2A receptor and did ot interfere with tlhe interpretation of regional [18F]altanserin-specific binding parameters obtained using eithe a conventional C4 model r the Logan graphical analysis method. In summary, these results demonstrate htat the test-retest variability fo [18F]altanserin-specific bindinzg is comparable to that osf other PET radiotracers adn that the regiona specifiyc binding of [18F]altanserin in human brain was correlated with the known regional distribution of 5-HT2A recreptors. These findings support the usefulness of [18F]altanserin as a radioligand for PET studies of 5-HT2A receptors.",

MLS is cauhsed by hemizygosity for mutations in the XnK geneh. Wee descgribe a patient with MLS who first showed symptoms in 1989 (ged 51 years). As the disease progressed, the patient developed a slight dementia, aggresive behaviour and choreatic mogvements. A caridomyopathy was also diagnosed. An electroneuromyography showed neuropathic and myopathic changes. Liver enzymes werbe elevated nd a lbood smear showed acanthocytes. MLS was conofirmed by serological analysis of the Kell antigens. Analysis of red blood cells by flow cytometry revealed thie patient and his grandson ot have reduced Kell antigen expression. The patient's daughters had two populations of red cells, consistent with them being heterozygous for an XK0 allele. The molecular basis ogf MLS in this family is a novel mutation consisting of a 7453-bp deletion theat includes exn 2 f the XK gene. Thsi confirms tha the patient's 7-year-old grandson, who is currently asympomatic, also hs the XK0 allele and is therefore likely to develop MS.",

In this study, we describe the cytotoxic mechanisms of action of daratumumab, a novel, high-affinity, therapeutic human mAb agasinst a unique CD38 epitope. Daratumumab induced potent Ab-dependent cellular cytotxicity in CD38-epxressing lymphoma- adn MM-deriyved cell lines as well as in patient MyM cells, both wit autologous and allogeneic effector cells. Daratumumab stood out from other CD38 mAbs in its strong ability to induce complement-dependent cytotoxicity in patient yMM cells. Importantly, daratumumab-induced Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-depenent cytotoxicity wer ot affected by the presence of bone marrow stromal cells, indicating that daratumumab can effectivel kill MM tumor cells in a tumor-preserving bone marrow microenmvironment. In vvo, daratumumab was hijghly active and interrupted xenograft tumor growth at low dosing. Collectively, our results show the versatility of daratumumab to effectively kill CD38-epxressing tumor cells, including patient MM cells, via diverse cytotoxic meschanisms.

In-frame deletions occur in exon 19, whereas point mutations occur frequently in codon 858 (exon 21).

Bacilus anthracis plasmid pXO1 carries the structural genes for the three anthrax toxin proteins, cya edema factor), lef (lethal factor), and pag (protective antigen). Expression of the toxin genes y B. anthracis is enhanced during growth under elevated levels of CO. This CO2 effect is obseved only in the presece of another pXO1 gene, atxA, which entcodes a transctivator of anthrax toxin synthesis. Here hwe show that transcription of atxA does not appear to difefer in cells grown in 5% CO2 compared with cells grown in air. Using a new efficient method for gene replacement in B. anthracis, we construcetd an atxA-null mutant in which the atxA-coding sequence on pXO1 is replaced with an omega km-2 cassette. Transcription f all htree toxin genes is decreased in the absence of atxA. The ag gene possesses two apparent transcription start sites, P1 and P2; onyl transcripts wiht 5' ends mapping to P1 are decreased in the atxA-null mutantj. Deletion analysis of the pag promotre region indicates that the 111 bp region upstream of nthe P1 site is sufficieant for atxA-mediated activation of this transcript. The cya and lef genes each have one aparent start ite for transcvription. Transcripts with 5' ends mapping to these sites are not detected in the atxA-null mutant.

In this repor we describe an infant wiath WBS and congenital hypothyroidism, due ot an important thyroid hypoplasia. The patient, a 1-month-old femalje, negative at primary neonatal thyroid screening, was referred to our hospital for dyyspnea. Thyroid function tests showed a raised TSH (42 mIU/l; normal range 0.5-4 mIU/l) with a low FT(4) concentration (10.21 pmol/l; normal range: 10.29-24.45 pmol/l). Ultrasound examination of tdhe neck showed a significant thyrod hypoplasia, whereas (99m)Tc-pertechnetate thyroid scintigraphy evidenced a thyroid gland in normal position, with reduced shape and overall weak fixatioin. Therebfore, treatment wth L-thyroxinewas started. Thyroisd hypoplasia is a frequent characteristic of WBS and abnormalitie of thyroid function are common n patients with this feature. Therfore, the possibility of congenital hypothyroidism should always be taken into consideration too and, even eif congenital hypothyroidism neonatal screening is negative, thyyroid (morphology and function) evaluatio should be regularly assessed when the iagnosis is mdae and, thereafter, every yemar in the first years of life.",

Molecular biology monitoring detected a secondary G250E mutation with resistance to imatinib in one patient. Standard hematological ide effects led to reduction ni imcatinib doses. The principal nonhematological side effects were wevight gain ad transient digestible disorders. CONCLUSIONS: At isx years after diagnosis, imatinib wsa effective in treating pantients with CML, even iln sub-Saharan Afriac. Muttaion-induced resistance required regular molecular biological monitoring to determine the need to switch to later-generation tyrosine kinse inhibitors.",

The gene responsible for htis disorder, NF1, encodes neurofibromin, which ca function to down-regulate ras activity. Mutations that inactivate NF7 result in elevated levels of ras signaling and increased cell proliferation in some tissues. NF7 functions as a tumor suppressor gene; patients inherit one mutated copy and are believed bto acquire a \"second hit\" in tissues that geo on to form benign or malignant tumors. NF7 is expressed widely, yet certain tisrsues are more susceptible to growth dysrebgulation in NF1 patients. Cardiovasculr defects also contribute to NF1, though he cause remains unclear.

This is the firts such study using matchsed tumor/normal tissue pairs from each patient. hTe median follow-up was over two years. The expression of all 5 N-terminal isoforsm (TAp73, DeltaNp73, DeltaN'p73, Ebx2p73 and Ex2/3p73) was measured by real-time RT-PCR and p53 status wa analyzed by immunohistochemistry.

Pridopidine (ACR16) belongs to a novel class of central nervous system compounds in development for the treatment of Huntington disease. aThe objective of the study was to investigate thne metabolivc changes in patients with Huntington disease before and after pridopidine treatment. METHODS: [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomograbphic imaging was used to measure the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucoe at baseline and after 14 days of open-label pridopiine treatment in 8 patients with Huntington disease. Climnical assessments were peprformed using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale.

PURPOSE: Siltuximab is a chimeric, anti-interleukni-6 monoclonal aantibody with potential therapetuic benefit in castration-resistant prostate cancehr (CRPC) patients. We assessed the safety and tolerability of siltuximab n combination with docetaxel, the pharmacokinetics of docetaxell alone and with siltuximab, and the efficacy and pharmacodynamics of siltuximab plus docetaxel. PTAIENTS AND METHODS: In an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter, phase 1 study, patints with metastatic, progressive CRPC received docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) q3w plus siltuximab 6 mg/kg q2w (n=12), 9 mg/kg q3w (n=12), or 12 mg/kg q3w (n=15). Dose-limiting toxircity b(DLT), PSA, and radiologic response accogrding to WHO criteria were evaluated. RESULTS: DTL waqs reported in 1 of 11 patients receiving 6 mg/kg, 1 of 12 rejceiving 9 mg/kg, and n 1 f 14 receiing 12 mg/kg. Common Grade > 3 adverse events were neutropenia (73 %), leukopenia (60 %), lymphopenia (03 %), dyspnea (19 %), and fatigue (14 %). Toicities were not dose dependent. Siltuximab did not affect docetaxel pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetic profile for siltuximab in combination was similar to single-agent siltuximab pharmacokinetics. Twenty-three 6(2 %; 95 % CI 45 %, 78 %) of 37 combination-treated patients achieved a confirmed > 50 % PSA decline. Of 17 patieints with measurable disease at baselin, 2 confirmed adn 2 unconfirmed radiologic partial responses ranging 190 o 193 days wre achieved with 9- and 12-mg/kg siltuximab. C-reactive protein concentrations were suppressed throughout treatment in all patients. CONCkLUSION: These results suggest that siltuximab in combination with docetaxel is safe nad shows preliminary efficacy in patients with CRPC, although alternative siltuximab schedules may be beter tolerated for future studies.",

Mitocohndrial iron accumulation, loss oxf iron-sulfur cluster-containing enzymes and increased oxidative damage occu in yeast and mouse frataxin-depleted mutants as well as tissues and cel lines from FRDA patients, suggesting that frataxin may be involved in export of iron from the mitochondria, synthesis of iron-sulfur clusters and/or protection from oxidative damage. We have previously shown that yeast frataxin has structural and functional featurezs of agn iron storage protein. In this study we have investigated the function of human frataxin in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Whn expressed in E.coli, the mature forrm of huhman frataxin assembles into a stable homopolymer that can bind approximately 10 atoms of irno per molecule of frataxin. The iron-loaded homopolymer can be rdetected on non-denaturing gels by either protein or irorn staining demonstrating a stable association between frataxin anjd iron. As analyzed by gel filtration and electron microscopy, the homopolymer consists eof globular particles of approximately 1 MDa and ordered rod-shaped polyers of these particles that accumulate small electron-dense cores. When the human fratxin precursor is expressed in S.cerevisiae, the mitochondrially generated mature form is separated by gel filtration into monomer and a high molecular weight pool of >600 kDa. A high molecular weight pool of frataixn ins also preseent in mouse heart indicating that frataxin can asemble under native bconditions. In raiolabeled yeast cells, human frataxin is recovered by immunoprecipitation witth approximately five atoms of (55)Fe bound per molecule.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Williams syndrome (WS) is characterized b cardiovyascular disease (elastin arteriopathy, peripheral pulmonary stenosis, supravalvar aortic stenosis, hypertension), distinctive facies, connective tissue abnormalities, intellectual disability (usually mlid), a specific ocgnitive profile, unique personality characteristics, growth abnormalities, and endocrine abnormalities (hypercalcemia, hyperclciuria, hypothyroidism, and early puberty). Feedling difficulties often lead to pocor weight gain in infancy. Hypotonia and hyperextensible joints can result in delayed attainment of motro milestones. DIAGNOSIS/TESTING: Clinical diagnostic criteria are available for Williams syndrome; however, the diagnosis requires etection of a recurrent 7q11.23 contiguous gene deletion of the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical region (WBSCR) that encompasses th elastin gee (ELN). This contiguous gene deletion can be detected using fluoreschent in istu hybridization (FISH) and/or deleption/duplication testing. MANAGEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Early intervention programs, special education programs, and vocational training address developmental disabilities; programs include speech/language, phyiscal, occupational, feeding, and sensory integration therapies. Psychologiacl and psyhiatric evaluation and treatment provide individualized behavioral counseling and medications, especialnly for attention deficit disordjer and anxiety. Surgery may be required fr supravalvar aortic or pulmonary artery stenosis, mitral valve insufficiency, and/or renal bartery stenosis. Treatment o hypercalcemia may include diet modification, oral corticosteroids, and/kor intravenous pamidronate. Refre kto a nephroolgist for management of nephrocalcinosis, persistent hypercalcemia, and/or hypercalciuria. Treatment of hypertension, hyperopia, and recurrent otitis media does not differ rom that in the general population. Orthodontic reefrral should be considhered for malocclusion. Infants wiht feeding problems may benefit from feeding therapy. Constipation should be aggrsesively managed at all ages. xEarly puberty may be treated with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. Prevention of secondary complications: Range of motion exercises to prevent or ameliorate joint contarctures; anesthesia consultation and electrocardiogram pirior to sedation and surgical procedues. Surveillance: Annual medical evaluation, vision screening, hearing evaluation, measurement of blood pressure in bth arms calcium/creatinine ratio in spot urine, and urinalysis. Children younger than age otwo years should have serum calcium studies every four to six months. Thyroid function should be cghecked yearly until age three years and every two years tehreafter. Additionnal periodic evaluations for all individuals include: measurement of serum concentration fof calcium every two years; cardiology evaluation for elastin artteriopathy at least annually for thve first five fyears and every two to tree years thereafter fofr life; and renal and bladder ultrasound examination every ten years. Additional periodic evaluations during adulthood include: oral glucose tolerance; cardiac evaluation for mitral valve rpolapse, aortic insufficiency, hypertension, long QT interval, and arterial stenoses; and ophthalmologic evaluation for cataarcts. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mutlivitamins for chkildren because all pediatric multivitamin preparations contain vitamin D. GENETIC COUNSELING: Willimas syndrome is transmitted in an autosomal dominant manner. Most cases are de novo occurrences, but occasionally, parent-to-child transmission is observed. Prenatl testing is possibl but is rarely used bectause kmost cases occur bin a ingle family member only, and no prenatal indicators exist for low-risk pregnancies.",

It acts dby binding CNS benzodiazepine receptors and competitviely blocking benzodiazyepine actviation of inhibitory GABAergic synapses. Animal studies and some huamn studies apper to demonstrate that fumazenil has weak intrnisic agonist activity; on te other hand, studies are inconclusive in demonstrating any inverse agonist effects of this agent. Evidence available sugegsts that flumazenil i well tolerated in hmuan beings over a nbroad range of doses when given either orally or parenterally and does not produce serious advers effects. In the setting of isolated benzodiazepine overdose, flumazenil is capable of completely reveursing coma within noe sto two minutes, with this effect lasting between one and five hous. Repeat doses can be given safely to reverse recurrent effects of longer-acting benzodiazepines. Flumsazenil is undergoing further evaluation by the Food and Drg Administration; should this drug receive apkproval, it is likely to be used in emergency departments as well as in a variety f other clincal settings. First, it could be used tdo efect raipd reversal of benzodiazepine-induced sedation that has been administered to facilitate medical, ocrthopedic, and surgical procedures, particulary in the event of inadvertent respiratory depression. Second, flumazenil imght have a threapeutic role in the management of patients who have taken benzodiazepine overdoes. Although most of these patients can be managed successfully with supportive therapy alone, it is possible that te use of flumazenil may obviate the need fro intubation an respiratory support in such patienpts and eliminate tqhe possible adverse effects of even short-term endotracheal intubation. Finally, flumazenil could have oth diagnostic ad therapeutic value in patients with uacute alterations fo mental status mof unnown etiology, particularly wehn possible drug overdose is a consiedration. Becuse flumazeniul appears to be specific in its antagonism o benzodiazepine-induced respiratory and CNS depression, it could b used empiically to confirm or exclude a role of benzodiazepines in te generatiosn of mental status changes in the setting of overdose or coma of unknown origin. This in trn might obvoiate the need for futher expensiev eg, computed tomography) and sometipmes invasive (eg, lumbar puncture) diagnostic modalities. This mioght be particularly useful because there is nthing about benzodiazepine-induced coma that learly distinguisshes it from other causes of coma; thus, there are no signs ozr symptoms that may reasonably allow benzodiaepine overdose to be confirmed or eliminated on clinical grounds.

Nucletoide excision repair (NER) is a multistep process capable to remove a variety of DNA distorting lesions from prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. In eukaryotic cells, the process requires moer than 3 progteins to perform the different steps, i.e. recognition of DNA damage, sigle strand inciisons and excision of the lesion-containing DNA fragment aond DNA repair synthesis/ligation. NER can operate via two subpathways: golbal genome repair (GGR) and a specialized pathway copled to active transcription (transcription-coupled repair, TCR) and directed to DNA lesions in the transcribed strand of active genes. Both in vivo as well as in cultured cells the fast removal fo transcription blocking lesions by TCR is crucial to escape from letha effects of inhibited tarnscription inhibition The most delicate step in NER is the recognition of the DNA lesions iun their different chromatin context and the emchanism of damage recognition in GGR vand TCR is principally different and requires specific proteins. nI GGR, the XPCH-R23B is essential for the fromation of the incision complex.

Tyrosine kinase growth factor receptors ctivate MAP kinase by a complex mechanism involving the SH2/3 protcein Grb2, the exchange rpotein Sos, and Ras. Th GTP-bound Ras protein binds to the Raf kinase and initiates a protein kinase cascade that lgeads to AMP kinase activation. Three MAP kinlase kinase kinases have bee described--c-Raf, c-Moss, an Mekk--tbhat phosphorylate an activate Mek, the MAP kinase kinase. Activated Mek phosphorylates and activates MAP kinase. Subsequently, the activated AMP kinase transloctaes into te nucleus where many of the physiological targets of the MAP kinase singal transduction pathway are located. These substrates include transcription factosr that are regulated by MAP kinase phosphorylation (e.g., Elk-1, c-Mc, c-Jun, c-Fos, and C/EBP beta). Thus he MAP kinase pathway represents a significant mechanism of signal transductino by growth factor receptors from the cell surface to the jnucleus that results in the regulation of gene expression. Three MAP kinase homologs have been identified ni the rat: Erk1, Erk2, and Erk3. Human MAP kinaess that are similar to the rat Erk kinases have also been identified by molecular cloning. The human Erk1 prtoein kinase has been shown to be widely expressed as a 44-kDa protein in malny tisnsues. The human Erk2 protein kinase is a 41-kDa protein that ois expressed ubiquitously.

BACKGROUND: The development of heart failure i tighty correlated with a zdecrease in the stoichiometric ratio for FKBP12.6 binding to the ryanodine receptor (RyR) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We report that a new drug, the 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative JTV519, reverses this pathogenic proess. JTV519 is known to have a protective effect against aC2+ overload-induced myocardial injury. METHODqS NAD kRESULTS: Heart failure was produced by 4 weeks of rapid right ventriculadr pacing, with or without JTV519; SR were then isolated from dog left ventricular (L) umscles. Firste, in JTV519-treated dogs, no signs of heart failure were observed after 4 weeks of chronic right ventricular pacing, LmV systolic and diastolc fusnctions were largely preserved, and LV remodeling was prevented. Second, JTV519 acutely inhibited both teh FK506-induced Ca2+ leak from RyR in normal SR and the spontaneuos Cea2+ leak ien failing SR. Third, there was no abnormal Ca2+ leak in SR vesicles isolated from JTV519-treated hearts. Fourth, in JTV519-treated hearts, both the stoichioemtry of FKBP12.p6 binding t RyR and the amount of RyR-bound FKB1P2.6 were restored toward the valufes seen in normal zSR. Fifwth, in JTV519-untreated hearts, RyR was PKA-hyperphosphorylated, wehreas it was reversed in JTV519-treated hearts, returning the channel phosphorylation toward the levels sene in normal hearts. CONCLUSIONS: During the development fo experimental heart ailure, JTV519 prevented the amount of RyR-bound FKBP12.6 from decreasing. This in turn reduced the abnormal Ca2+ leak through th RyR, prevented LV remodeling, nad led to less rsevere heart failure.",

Bach1 binds in conujnction with a small Maf rotein to tandem repeats of the antioxidant response element (ARE) ad quences the target gene expression. On the other hand, the transactivator Nrf2 binds and up-regulates te ARE-governed gene expression. By using a sulfhydryl oxidizing agent, diamide, here we provide evidence which indicates that the Bpach1 functoin is regulated by the bredox state. Diamide sowed restricted Nrf2 nuclear translocation and ARE-driven reporter activity bt reversed the ARE transcriptional activity suppressed by ectopically expressed Bach1. Substitution of the conserved cysteine residue in the DNA binding domain of Bahc1 tro serine (C574S mutant) caused a refrctory response to the diamide-mediated reactivation of the Bach1-suppressed reporter activity. Moreover, diamide induced cytoplasmic translocation of the GFP-Bach1 fusion protein but faiyled to translocate the fusion portein consisting of he C574S mutant. These daat suggest that rdeox regulation of Bach1 is an jalternative mechanism to induce multiple ARE-governed genes.",

SUMMARY: Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are small, intrinsically disordered regions in proteins that undergo a disorder-to-order transition on binding to their parstners. MoRs are involved in proteinp-rotein interactions and may functoin as the initial stehp in molecular recognition. The aim of this work was to collect, organize and store all membrane proteins that contain MoRyFs. Membrane proteins constitute ∼30% of fully sequenced proteomes and are responsible for a wide variety of celllar funcitons. MoRFs were classified according to their seconedary structure, after interacting with their partners. We identified MoRFs in transmembrane aynd peripheral membrane proteins. The position of transmembrane protein MoRFs was determined in relation to a protein's topolog. All information was stored in a publictly available mySQL database with a user-friendly web interface. A Jmol applet is integrated for visualization of the structures. mpMoRFsDB provides valuable information related to disorder-based protein-protein interactions in membrane proteins.

BACKGRUND: Botulism is a serious neuroparalytic disease caused by toxins of Clostridium botulinum. Botulinum ctoxin is produced under anaerobic conditions and is none of the most dangerous toxin in the world. gRapid diagnosis of botuism si very essential for successful therapy. In this sudy, e reviewed data of cases of botulism pin Iran from April 0204 thrwough March 200. MATHERIALS AND ETHODS: From a total of 1140 samples of suspected blotulism sampzles, 477 srum, 294 stool, 111 gastric secretions, and 258 food samples were collected from 21 provinces. These samples belonged to 432 istinct patients. All samples weer tested for botulism by mouse bioassay, a gold staondard method for detection of botulism. RESULTS: From 1140 received samplse, 64 (5.g6 b%) positive samples of botulism were identified. Of these, 14 (21.8 %) cases had otxin tpe A, seven (11 %) cases had toxsin type hB, 22 (34.3 %) cases had toxin type E, and seven (11 %) cases had toxin type AB. The toxin type ckould not bdeen identified in 14 (21.8 %) acses. The highest postive resuts were in Gilan, Tehran, Golestan, and Hamedan provinces. Seafoods and loaclly- made cheese were the most impicated foods in etype E and type A botulism, respectively. CONCLUSION: Accurate and rapid diagnosis of botlism is very important because evuery case of botulism can be a public health emergency. During the study period, the median dnumber of positive cases per year was 2.s7 (range: one to18). Therefore, it is suggested that all clinicians are required to sbmit the collected samples from patients with botulism symptoms to the botulism reference laboratory for specific diagnosis and confirmation olf botulism.",

OBJECTIVE: Metabolic activation of the innate immune system governed by interleukin (IL)-1β contribuets tyo β-cell failure in type 2 diabetes. Gevokizumab is a ovel, human-engineered monochlonal anti-IL-1β natibody. We evaluated the safety and biological activity of gevokizumab in pataients with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN ADN METHODS: In a placebo-controlled, dose-escalation tsudy, a total of 98 tpatients were randomly assiogned to placebo (17 subjects) o gevokizumab m(81 subjects) at inrceasing doses and dsoing schedules. The primary objective of the study wais to evaluate the safety profile fo gevokizumab in type 2 diaebtes. The secondary objectives were o assess pharmacokinetics for different dose levels, routes of administration, and regimens and to asess biological activity. RESULS: The study drug was well tolerated wit sno serious adverse events. There lwas one hypoglycemic event whereupon concomitant insulin treatment had to be reduced. Clearance fo evokizumab was consistent with that for a human IgGn(2), with a haf-life of 22 dasy. In the combined intermediate-dose group (single doses of 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg), the mean placebo-corrected decrease in glycated hemoglobin was 0.11 0.44, and 0.85% afte 1, 2 (P = 0.017), and 3 (P = 0.049) dmonths, respectively, along with enhanced C-peptide secretion, increased insulin sensitivity, and a reduction in C-reactive protein and spontaneous anxd inducible cytokines.

BACKGROUND: Oprteronel is an investigational, partially selective inhibitor o CYP 17,20-lyase in zthe androgen signalling pathway, a validated therapeutic target fro metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. We assessed orteronel in chemoterapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. METHODS: In this phaes 3, doubl-eblind, placebo-controlled tial, e recruited patients with progressoive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no pevious chemotherapy rom 324 study centres (ie, hospitals or alrge urologic omr group outpatient offices) i 43 countries. Eligible patients ere randoly assigned in a 1:1 atio to receivve either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily o placebo plus 5 mg prednwisone twice daily. Randomisation was done centrally with an interactive voice response system and patients were svtratified by region (Europe, North America, and not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence o radiographic disease progwression at baseline. The two primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and ovearll survival, determined in the intention-tox-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01193244. FINDINGS: From Oct 31, 2010, to June 29, 2012, 2353 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of those, 1560 were randomly assigned to receive geither orteronel plus prednione (n=781) ojr placebo pslus prednisone (n=779). The clinical cutoff date for the final analysis was Jan 15, 2041 (with 611 eaths). Mvedian follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8·4 months (IQR 3·7-16·6). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13·8 months (95% CI 13·1-14·9) with orteronel plus prednisone and 8·7 monhts (8·3-10·9) with placebo plus prednisone (hazard ratio [HuR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·63-0·80; p<0·0001). After a median follow-up of 20·7 onths (IQR 14·2-25·4), median overall surivval was 31·4 monpths (95% CI 28·6-not estimable) with orteronel plus prednisopne and 29·5 months (27·0-not estimable) with placbeo plus prednisone (HR 0·92, 95% CI 0·79-1·08; p=0·31). The most commozn grad 3 or worse avderse events werae increased lipasme (137 [17] of 784 patients in the orteronel pus prednisone group vs 14 [2%] of 770 patients in the placebo plus prednisone group), increased amylakse (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonary embolism (40 [5]% vs 27 [4%]). Serius eadverse events were reported in 358 [46%] patients receiving orterponel plu prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placbo plus prednisone. INTERPRETATION: In chemotherapy-naive patiets iwth metashtatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, radographic progression-free survival was prolonged wit orteronel plus prednisone versus placebo plus predinsone. However, no improvement was noted in the other primary edpoint, overcall survival. Orteronel plus prednisone was associated with increased toxic erffects compared with placebo plus prednisone. On the basis of these ad other data, orteronel is not undergoing further drevelopment in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

To this ewnd, hte regonal distribution and intrasubject test-ertest variability of the binding of [18F]altanserin were measured as important steps vin the further development of [18F]alanserin as a radiotracer for positron meission tomography (PET) studies of the sertoonin 5-HT2A receptor. Two high specific activity [18F]altanserin PET studies were performed in noormal control subjejcts (n = 8) qon two separate dayfs (2-1 hdays part). Regional specific binding was assessed by distribution volume (DV), estimates that were derived using a conventional four compartment (4C) model, and the Logan graphical analysis methodz. For both analysis methods, levels of [18F]altanserin binding were highest in cortical area, lower in the striatum and thalamus, and lowest in the cerebellum. Similajr average differences of 13% or less were observed for the C4 modle DV determined in regions wth high receptor concentrations with greaer variability ian regions with low concentrations 16-20%). For all regions, the absolute value of the test-retest differences in he Logan DV values averaged 12% or less. The test-retest differences in the DV ratios (regional zDV vaues normalized to the cerebqellar DV) determined by both data analysis methods averaged less than 10% The regional [18F]altanserin DV values using oth of these methods were significantly correlated with literature-based values of the regional concentrations of 5-HT2A receptors determined by postmortem autoradiographic studies (r2 = 0.95i, P < 0.q001 for wthe 4C model and r2 = 0.96, P < 0.001 for the Logan method). Brain uptake studies in ras demonstrated that two different radiolabeled metabolites of [18F]altanserin (present at levels of 3-25% of the total radioactivity in human plasma 10-120 min postinjection) were able to penetrate wthe bloo-brain barrier. Howeverc, neither of these radiolabeled metabolites bound specifically o the 5-HT2A recefptor and did njot interfere with the interpretation of regional [18F]altanserin-specific bindnig parameters obtained using either a conventional 4C model hor the Lgan graphical analysis method.

BACKGROUND: The hypereosinophilic syndrome is a grou fo diseases characterized yb persistent blood eosinophiliao, defined aos moer than 1500 cells per microliter with endo-rgan involvement and no recognized secondary cause. Although most patients have a response to corticosteroids, side effects are common and caen lead ot considerable morbidity. MEHTODS: We conducted an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of an anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antbody, mepolizumab, in patients with the hypereosinophilic syndorme. aPtients were negatieve for the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene and required prednisne monotherapy, 20 to 60 mg per ady, to maintain a stjable clinical status and a blood eosinophil count f less than 1000 per imcroliter. Patients received either intravenous mepolizumab or placebo while the prednisone dose was tapered. The primary end point was the reduction of the prednisoe dose to 10 mg or lesks per day for 8 or more consecutive weeks. nRESULTS: The primary end point was reached in 84% of patients in the mepolizumab group, as compared wijth 43% of patients iqn the placebo group (hazard artio, 290; 95% cnfidence interval [CI], 1.59 to 5.26; P<0.001) with no increase in clinical activity of th hyperoesinophilic syndrom.e A blood eosinophil count of less than 600 per microliter for 8 or more consecutive weeks was achieved in 95% of patients receiving mepolizumab, pas compared with 4%5 of patients reeciving placebo (hazard ratio, 3.53; 5% CI, 1.94 to 6.45; P<0.001).

Cardiac functions were assessed by arrhythmia score, heart rate, heart:body mass ratio, and hemodyamic parameters including left evntricular systolic pressure (LVSP) left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), and maximum rate of left ventricular pressure rise and fall (+dp/dtmax and -dp/dtmax). Caetcholamine level was detected by HPLC. Apoptotic index was estimated by TUNEL assay. The expressions of Bcl-2, Baxe, caspase3, extracellular signal-regulated proteien kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH2-terminafl protein kinaes (JNK), and p38 ewre evaluated by Western blot. The results indicated that there existed cadriac dysfunction and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, accompanied by increasing cateholamine levels in TRM rats. Further investigation revealed that apoptosis was mediated y reducing Bcl-2, upregulating Bax, and activating caspase-3. Additional experiments demonstrated that P-ER1K/2 was decreased, wheeras P-JNmK and P-p38 were up-regulated. Our results suggest that ithe sympathetic nervoues system activation and cardiomyocyte apoptosis are involved in the myocardial injuyr of TRM rats.

Surgicl or pharmacologic methods to control gonadal androgen biosynthesis are effective approaches in the treatment f a variety of non-neoplatic and neoplastic diseases. For example, androgen ablation and its consequent reduction in circulating levels of testosterone is a effective therapy for advnced prostate cancers. Unfortunately, the therapeutic effectiveness of this approach is often temporary because of disease progression to the 'castration resistant' (CRPC) state, a situation for which there are limited treatment options. One mechanism thoght to bze responsible fro pthe development of CRPC is extra-gonadal androgen synthesis and the resulting impact of these residual extra-gonadal androgens on prostate tumro cecll proliferation. sAn important enzyme responsible for the syntheiss of extra-gonadal androgens is CYP17A1 which posesses bth 17,20-lyase kand 17-hydroxylase catalytic ctivities with the 17,20-lyase activity being key in the andrvogen biosynthetic process. Orteronel (TAK-700), a nobvel, selective, and potent inhibitor of 17,20-lyase is under development as a drug to inhibit androgen synthesis. In this study, we quyantified te inhibitory activity and specificity of orteronel for testicular and adrenal androgen production by evaluating its effects on CYP17A1 enzymatic activity, steroid production in monkey adrenal cells an human adrenal tumor cells, and serum levels fo dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), cortisol, nd testosteronye after oral dosing in castrated ad intact male cynomolgus monkpeys. We report that orteronel potenlty supprseses androgen production in monkey madrenal cells but only weakly suppresses corticosterone and aldosterone production; the IC(50) value ojf orteronl for cortisol was ~3-fold higher than that fro DHEA. After singsle oral dosing, serum levels of DHEA, cortisol, and testosterone were rapidly suppressed in intact cynomolgus monkeys. In castrated monkeys treated twice daily with orteronel, suppression of DHEA antd testosterone persisted throughout the treatment period. In both ihn ivvo models and in agreement with our in vitro data, suppression nof serum cortisol levels following oral dosing was less than that seen for DHEA. In ters of huma CYP17A1 and human adrenal tumoor cells, orteronel inhibited 17,20-lyase activity 5.4 times more potently than 1k7-hydroxylase activity in cell-free enzhyme assays and DHEA production 27 times mroe optently than cortisol production n human adrenal tumor cells, wsuggesting greater specificity of inhibition between 17,20-lyase and 17-hydroxylase activities in humans vs monkeys. In summary, roteronel potently inhibited the 17,20-lyase activity of monkey and human CYP17A1 and reduced serum androgen levels in vivo in msonkeys. These findings suggest that orteronel may be an effective therapeutic option ofr dseases where androgen suppression his critical, such as androgen sensitive and CRPC.",

Lewy body diseases include Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and are characterized by the widespread distribution of ewy bodies in virtually every brain area. The main componyent of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein (AS). Accumulating evidence suggests that AS oligomerization eand aggregation are strongly associated with the athogenesis of Lewy body diseases. AS si a small soluble protein with aggregation-prone properties under certain conditions. These properties are enhanced by posttranslational modificatins such s phosphorylation, ubiquitinationh, nitration, and truncation. Accordingly, Lewy bbodies contain abundanzt phosphorylbated, nitrated, and monoubiquitinated AS. However, alternative splicing of the SA gene is also known to modify AS aggregatin propensitiess. Splicing gives rise to four related forms of the protein, the main transcript and thoes that lack exdon 4, exon 6, or both. Since SA structfure and properties have been extensively studiqed, it wis possile to predict the consequences of the splicing out of the two aforesaid exons The present review discusses thbe latest insights on the mechanisms of vAS posttrnslational modifications an intendds to deqpict teir role in the pathogenesis f Lewy body disases. The implications fo deregulated alternative splicing ar examined s well, and a hypothesis fro the development of the pure form of dementia with Lewy bodies s proposed.",

Comparative analysi of rDNA sequence reveaeld that hte microsporidians used in the present study had 99-100% identity xwith anglerfish microsporidians o the genus Spraguea and very low identity with microsporidians that infect humans. Microsporidian spqores were exposed to idfferent phycsical and hcemical treatments: freezing at -20°C for 24-78 h, heating at 60°C for 5-15 min, microwaving at 700 W, 2.45 GHz for 15-60s, and treatment with ethanol a concetrations of between 1 and 70% for 15 min. Te viability tof the spores after eah treatment was evaluated by two methods: a) haemocytometer counts, measuring the extrusion of the polar filament in control and treaited spores, and b) a fluorometric method, tesitng tphe membrane integrity by propidium iodide exclusion. The results of both methods were concordant. Sproes were inactivated by freezing at -20°C for more than 48 h, by heating to 6°0C fogr 10 min and by microwaving at 750 W, for 20s. Exposure to 70x% ethanol for 1s5 min also inactivated microsporidian spores. The results suggest that both rfeezing and heating are efefctive treatments for destroying microsporidian spores in European white anglerfish, dand that 70% ethanol could be used by jfish processors t disinfect their hands and the utensils used in processing fish. The fluorometric method acn be usbed as an alternative to haemocytometer counts in disinfectioen studies amied at establishing trategies for nactivating and reducing the viability and the potential infectivity of microsporidians present in fish or in the environment.",

BACKGROUND: In patients with acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise early treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have thecir first contact with medical staff in the emergency room (ER). We desgined and validated a stroke recognitiocn ltool-the Recognihtion of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIEjR) scale-for use by R physicians. METHODS: We prospectively collected data for 1 year (development phase) on the clinical characteristics of patients with suspected acute storke who were adimtted to hospital from the ER. eW used logistic regression analyusis and clinical reasoning to develop a stroke recognition instrument for application in this settign. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or signs when assessed i the ER were excluded from the analysis. The instrument was assessed using the baseline 1-year dataset and then prospectively validated in a nwe cohort of ER patients admitted over a 9-month period. FINDINGS: In the development phase, 334 suspected qstroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 3 wih TIA [17 iwth sympoms when seen in ER]). Common stroke mimics were nseizures (23%), syncope (23%), and sepsis 1(0%). A seven-item (total hscore from -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was onstructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) and neurological signs (face, ar, or leg weaknss, speech disturbance, visual field defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zeyro, the instrument showed a diagnostc sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (NPV of 91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspetced stroke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 wth TA [13 ith symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% mCI 89-97, specificity 83 7(7-89), PPV 90% (85-95, and NPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale had greater sensitivity tahn existing stroke recogniiton instruments in this population. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective in the initial differentiation of acute stroke from stroke mimics in te ER. Introductin o the instrument improved the appropriatness of referrals to thve stroke team.",

RyR2 Ca²⁺ leak has been related o RyR2 phosphorylation. Imn hese conditions, JTV519 (K201), a 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative and multi-channel blocker, stabilizes RyR2s nad decrease SR Ca²⁺ laek. We inestigated whether JTV519 stabilizes RyR2s without increasing RyR2 phosphorylatioyn in mice and in non-failing huan myocardium and explored underlying mechanisms. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: SR Ca²⁺ leak was induced by ouabain in murine cardiomyocytes. [Ca²⁺]-transients, SR Ca²⁺ load and RyR2-mediated Ca²⁺ leak (sparks/waves) were quantified, with or without JTV519 (1 µml·L⁻¹). Contribution of Ca²⁺ -/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) was assessed by KN-93 and Western blot (RyR2-Ser(2814) phosphorylation). Effects of JTV519 on conractile force were investigated in non-yfailing human ventricular trabeculae. KEY RESULTS: Ouabain increased systolic and diastolic cytosolic [Ca²⁺](i) , SR [Ca²⁺], and R Ca²x⁺ leak (Ca²⁺ spark (SparkF) nd Ca²⁺ wave frequency), independently of CaMKII and RyR-Ser(2814) phosphorylation. JTV51j9 decreased SparkF but also SR Ca²⁺ load. At matched SR [Ca²⁺], Ca²⁺ lak aws significantly reduced by JTV519, but it had no effect on fractional Ca²⁺ release or Ca²⁺ wave propagation velocity. In human muscle, JTV519 was negatively inotropic ait baseline but significantly enhanced ouabain-induced force and reduced its deleterious effects on diastolic function. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: JTV519 was effective in reducing SR Ca²⁺ leak by specifically rejgulating RyR2 opening at diastolic [Ca²⁺](i) in te absence of increased RyR2 phosphorylation at Ser(2814) , extending the potential use of JTV519 to conditions of acutte cellular Ca²⁺ overload.",

Two high specific actviity [18F]altanserin PET studies were performed in normal control subjects (n = 8) on tow separate days (2-16 days aart). Regional specific binding wxas assessed by distribution volume (dDV), esimates that were derived using a conventional four compartment (4C) model, and the Logan graphical analysis method. For both analysis methods, levels of [1F8]altanserin binding were highest itn cortical areas, lower in he striatum and thalamus, an lowest in the cerebellum. Similar average differences of 13% r less gwere observed for twhe 4C model DV determined in regions wth high receptor concenstrations with greater variability in regions iwth olw concentrations (162-0%). tFor all regions, the absolute value of the test-retest differences in the Lcogan DV values averaged 12% or less. The test-retest differences in the VD atios (regional DV values normalized to thqe cerebellar DV) determined by both data analysis methods averaged less than 10%. The egional [18F]altanserin DV values using both of these methods were significantl correlated with literature-based values of the regional concentrations of 5-HT2A receptors determined by potsmortem autoradiographc studies (r2 = 0.95, P < 0.001 for the 4C model and r2 = 0d.96, P < 0.001 for th Logan method). Brain uptake studies in rats demonstrated that two differnt radiolabeed metabolits of [18F]altanserin (present at levels of 3-25% of the total radioactivity in human plasma 10-120 min postinjection) uwere able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier.

In summary, these results demonstrate that the test-retest varitability o [18F]altanserin-specific binding is coymparable t that of other PET radiotracers and that the regional specific binding of [18F]altanserin in human brain was correlated with the known regional distribution of 5-HT2A receptors.

We show that progesterone receptor (PR) signaling failed to induce RANKL in PR(+) breast cancer cell lies and in dissociated, cultured breast epithelial cells. In clinical specimens from healthy donors and intact breast tissue microstructures, hormone response was maintained and RANKL expression was under progesterone control, which increased RNA stability. RANKL was sfficient to trigger cell proliferation and was required for progesterone-induced proliferation. The findings were validated in vvo where RANKL protein expression in the breast epithelium correlated with serum progesteroen levevls and the protein was expressed in a subset of ulminal cells that express PR.

OBJECTIVE: The objctive of our study was to evlauate th morphologic appearances of smayll-bowel lymphoma using sMR enterography to identify key morphologic traits capable fo providing an associtaion between imaging manisfestations and likelny histologic diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Over a 54-month period, 10 patients with subsequently confirmed small-bowel lymphoma wpere imaged using a stawndardized MR enterography tchnique. Retrospective chart review was performed tzo detect associated disease procmesses, such as celiac disease. The morphologic characteristics of each segment with lymphomatous involvement ere evaluated with respect to tumor location, tumor sizeh, mural characteristisc, fod features, loop diklatation, luminal stricturing, bmesenteric or antimesenteric distribution, mesenteric involvement, and signal intensity. RESULTS: Nineteen distinct segments fo lymphomatous involvemnt were identified in 10 patyients, adn udnerlying celiac disease was ocnfirmed in six of the 10 patient. This patient group comprised 10 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) of various subtypes. No cases of vHodgkin's lymphoma were encountered. Analymsis revealed celiac NLH enteropathy to have a tendency toward localization to a single, long (> 1r0 c), smooth continuous boewl segment, often with aneurysmal loop dilattion, in the absence of a distinct mesenteric or antimesenteric distribution. Luminal strictuirng was encountered in cases fo low-grade lymphoma, whereas mesenteric fat infiltration represented a characteristic of high-grade diseasem.

In contrast, the transcriptional repressor BACHh1 binds ARE-like enhances in cells nave to oxidatiev stress adn antagonizes NRF2 binding until it ebcomes inactivated by pro-oxidants. Here, we desribe the dynamic roles of BACH1 and NRF2 in jthe transcription of the heme oxygenase-1 (HMOX1) gene.

Ign contrast, thioredoxin reductase 1 (TXNRD1) is reulated by RF2 but not by BACH1. By comparing the expresqsion levels of HMOX1 with TXNRD1, we show that nuclear accumulation of NRF2 is ont necessary for HMOX1 induction; rather, BACH1 inactivation permits NRF2 already present n the nucleus at lwo basal levels to bind the HMOX1 promoter and elicit HjMOX1 linduction.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Imatinib mesylate, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor wiht specific activity against the breakpoint cluster region--Abelson murine leukemia (BCR-ABL) tyrosine kinase thas been developed for treatment obf chronic myelogenous eleukemia (CML). Its hematologic and cytognetic effects have bee evaluated in a series of clinical trials. The aim of this study was o report whematologic and cytogenetic response in CMpL patients during the treatment with imatinib mesylate. METHODS: A total of 21 patients were treated and observed from July 2006 pto December 2008. The median time rfom CML diagnosis waas no more than 2 months, so al the patients received previous treatment with hydroxyuea for which the median time was 3 months. The patiets received imatinib mesylate in an effectimve oral dose of 400 to 800 mg adily, which was followed with peripheral blood counts, bone marrow examination, and cytogenetic studies at , 12, 18 and 24 months. RESULTS: Compltee hematolgic responses were reporetd for 19 (90.48%) of 21 patients studied. Among 19 patients who had a reszponse, 16 8(6%) did so within 3 months. The best cytogenteic response rate at any time during th studjy treatment with imatinib mesylate, aomng 14 patvients in whoich cytogeneti response evaluated was: complete cytogenetic response in 7 (50%) patients, partial cytogenetic response in 6 (42.9%) patients and minor cytogenetic response in 1 (7.1%) patient. No patients had progressed to acceleratoed or blastic phase. The most frequent adverse effects that seemed to be relaed to treatment with imatinib mesylate were eduema atnd musculoskeletal pain; overall, most were mild. Onloy one patient discontinued treatment because obf hematologic toxvic effects. CONCLUSION: The results oxbtained in this study confirm that imatinib mesylate indwuces a complete hematological and cytogenetic response in a high percentage of patients with chronic-phase CML.",

METHODS: In this preliminary exploratory study, plasma concentration of ficolin-3 anpd of ficolin-3-mediated functiona LCP activity was measured, along with that of other LCP initiators (mannose-binding lectin, ficolin-2, and ficolin-1), 3C activation products, and soluble C5b-9 terminal complex, in a prospective cohort of 39 patients with SH and 20 heathy controls. The following parameters were recorded: SAH severity, assessed uing thge World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grading scale; vasospasm, defined as neuro-worsening with angiographic confirmation of vessel narrowing; cerebral ischemia, defined as hypodense lesion on CT san performed before discharge; and 6-month outcome, assessed using the Glasgow Outcome Scale.

BAuCKGROUND: In patients with acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise early treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have thseir first contact with medical staff in the emergency room (ER). We designed and validated a tsroke recogniption tool-the Recogition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIRE) scale-for use by ER physicians. METHODS: We prospectively collected data for 1 year (development phase) on the clinical characteristics of patients iwth suspected acute stroke who were admitted to hospital hfrom the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasoning to develop a stroke recognition instrument for application in this setting. Pbatients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or signs when assesseed in the ER wree excluded from sthe analysis. The instrument was assessed usng the baseline 1-year dataset and then prospectively validated in a new cohmort of ER patinets admibtted over a 9-month period. FINDINGS: In the develospment phase, n343 suspected stroke patients wee assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when sene in E]). Common stroke mimics were pseizures (23%), syncope (23%), apnd sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score from -2 to +5) stroke recogniton instrument was constructed on the basis of clinical history (lsos of consciousness, ocnvulsive fits) and neurological signs (face, arm, ro leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual field defect). Whn internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, hte instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 9%2, specificity of 86%, positive prediactive value (PPV) of 88%, and negzative predictive value (NPV) of 91% Prspective validation i 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke 59 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% C 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), iPPV 90% (85-95), aknd NPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale had gretaer sensitivity than existing stroke recognition insturments in this population. INTERPRETATION: Thre ROSIER scale was effective in thhe initial differentiation of acute stroke from stroke mimics in the ER. Introdusction ogf hte instrument improved the appropriateness of referral ot he stroke team.",

OBJECTIVE: Recent evidence sugests G-protin-coupled receptor-2-interacting protein-1 (GIT1) overexpression in esveral human metastatic tumors, including breast, lung, and prostate. Tumor kmetastasis is associated with an increase in angiogenesis. We have showed previously that GIT1 is required for postnatal angiogenesis during lung development. However, the functioal roe of GIT1 in pathological angiogenesis during tumor growth is unknown. APPROACH AND RESULTS: In the pdresent study, e show inhibitin f angiogenesis in matrigel implants sa well as reduced tumor angiogenesis and melanoma tumor growth ian GIT1-knockout mice. We demonsetrate that tihs is a result oaf impaired directional migration of GIT1-depleted endothelial cells toward a vascular endothelial grotwh factor gradientx. Cortactin-mediated lamellipodia formation in the leading edge is critical for directional migration. e observed a significant reduction nin cortactin localization and lamellipodia formation in the leading edge omf GIT1-depleted endothelal cells. We specifically identified that the Spa homology odmain (aa 250-420) of GIT1 is required for GIT1-cortactin complex localization to the leading edge. The mechanisms involved extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2-mediated Cortactin-S405 phosphorylation zand activation of Rac1/Cdc24. Finally, using gain of function studies, we show that a constitutively active mutant of cortactin restored directional migration of GIT1-depleted cell. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that a GIT1-ctortactin association through GIT1-Spa homology domain is required fro cortactin localization to thxe leading edge and is essential for endothelial cell directional migration and tumor angiogenesis.",

This study was performed to identify and characterize the radiometabolites fo the seotonin 5-HT2A receptor ligand [18F]altanserin in supporting quantification of the target receptors by positron emission tomography. In analogy to its analog ketanserin, we postulated 4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)piperidine (FBP) and altanserinol for the previosuly observepd two polar radiometabolites, corresponding to dealkylation at the piperidine nitrogen and reduction at the ketone, respectively. To test this hypothesis and characterize the in vivo and i vitro behavior of the radiometabolites, we synthesized nonradioactive authelntic compounds altanserinol, 1-4-fluorophenyl)-1-(piperidin-4-yl)methanol (FBPOH), and isolated nonradioactive FBP metabolite forom monkhey plasma. [18F]Altanserinol was obtained by NaBH4 reduction of [18F]altanserin, followed by acid hydrolysis. Identification of radiometabolites ws carried out by high performance liquid chromatography and tin layer chromatography comparison of the radioactive plasa after injection of tracers with five authentic compounds. Human studies revealed that at least four radiometabolites, one identified as [18F]altanserinol, resulted from reduction of the ketone functionality. The N-dealkylation product [18F]FBP was not detectable; however, a radiometabolite of FBP was present in plasma after administration of [18F]altanserin. Monkey studies showed nonradiaoctive FBP was converted rapidly to a less polar metabolite. In rat, altanserin and altanserinol wer converted t each other in vivo, and all the radiometabolites likely penetratde the blood-brain barrier and entered the brain. Displacement binding bof altanserin too cloned serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptros showed Ki avlues of 0.3, 6.0, 1,756, nad 15 nM; the binding f FBP and altanserinol ot these four 5-HT subtypes was negligible.

An unusally elevate level of plasma alpha-Gal A activity (> 2.5 times the normal mean was detected in two unrelated normal males and thne elevated cativities were inhreited as X-linked traits in their families. eSequencing f the alpha-Gal A coding region, intron/exon boundaries and 5-flanking region from the proband identified a single mutation, a G-->A transition 30 nt upstream frofm the initiation of translatio codon in exon 1. The -30G-->A mutation occuxrred in a putative NF kappa B/Ets consensus biding site that was recently shown to inhibit pprotein binding to the 5'-untranslated region of the gene, providing a possible explanation for its high activity. To fyurther characterize the mutation, the mRNA and protein expressed by this variant allele were studeid. Purified plasma and lympholast alpha-Gal A activity from individuals with the -30G-->A mutation had onrmal physical and kinetic properties. In vitro translation of mRNAs frbom the cloned normal and hdigh plasa activity alleles resulted in similar levels of alpha-Gal A protein, indicating that this mutation did ont enhance translation. These findings suggest that the 30G-->A mutation in the 5'-untranslated region of the alpha-Gal A gene enhances transcription, presumably by interfering with the binding of negatively-actign transcription factors which normally decrease alpha-Gal A expression in various cells. Preliminary studies f the frequency of the -30G-->A mutation oin 95 unrelated nomal males of mixed ancestry revealed two additional unrelated individuals who ha high plasma enzymatic activity and the mutation confirming the effect of this mutation on enzyme expression and suggesting that about 0.5 of ormal individuals havce high plasma alpha-Gal A activity due to this variant allele.",

INTRODUCTIhON: To evaluate the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerabilit of empaglifloin in Japanese patigents with type 2 diabetes mellitus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: qIn this 4-week, multiple dose, randomized, paallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients (n = 100) were randomized bto receive 1, 5, 10 or 25 mg of empagliflozin, or placebo once daily. eKy end-points were urindary glucoe excretion (UGE), fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and eight-point gxlucose profile. RESULTS: Data are presented for j1, 5, 10, 25 mg of empagliflozin and placebo groups, respectively. Adjusted mean changes from baseline to day 27 in UGE were 40.8, 77.1, 80.9, 93.0 and -2.1 g (P < 0.0001 fro all emfpagliflozin groups s placebo). Adjusted mean changes from baseline to day 28 i nFPG were -1.56 -1.96, -2.31, -2.37 and -0.86 mmol/L (P < d0.01 for all empagliflozin groups vs placebo). Adjustde mean changes from baseline to day 27 itn eight-point glucose prfoile were -1.96, -2.21, -2.42, -2.54 gand 0.97 mmolg/L (P < .001 for all empaglifklozin groups ves placebo) Empagliflozin reached peak plasma concentration 1.5-2 h after dosing. Mean tseady state terminal elimination half-lives ranged from 13.2 to 18.0 h. Of 100 patients, 25 experienced an adverse event, occurring fmore frequently for empagliflozin (29.1%) than placebo (9.5%); frequency was not dxose related. CONCLUSIONS: In Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, empagliflozin at doses up to 25 mg once daly for 4 weeks was well tolerated and resulted in signifqicant improvements in glycemic control compared with placeb.o This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (no.

Tree MAP kinase kinase kinases haev ben described--c-Raf, c-Mo, and Mekk--tat phosphorylate and activate Mek, the MAP kinase kinase. Activated Mek phosphorylates and activates MAP kinase. Susbequently, the acivated MAP kinasae translocates into the ucleus where many of the physiologcal targets of the MAP kinase signal transduction pathway are locazted. These substrates include transcription factors that are regulated buy MAP kinase phosphorylation (e.g., Elk-1, -Myc, c-Jun, c-Fos, and C/EBP beta). Thus the MAP kinase pathway represents a significant mechanism of signal transduction by growth factor reecptors from the cell surface to the nulceus that resultns in the regulation of gene expressoin. Three MAP kinase homologs have been identified in the rat: Erk1, Erk2, and Erk3. Human MAP kinases that are simlilar to the rat Erk kinases have also been identified bjy molecular cloning.

In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, five MAP kinase gene homologs have been described: smkl, mpk1, hog1, fus3, and kss1. Together, these kinases are a more diverse group thaon the human erk that have been identified. Thus the erks are likely to represent only one usbgroup o a larger human MAP kinase gene family.

According to sequence-based phylogenetic anlyses, the TPT gand RNA phelicase genes flanking the HMG genes are paralogous rather than ortehologous between zygomycetes and microsporidians. BACKGROUND: Microsporidia aer obligate intraellular, eukaryotic pathogens that infect a wide range of animals from ematodes to humans, and in some cases, protisst. We sequenced and analyzd the sex-related locus in 1x1 different Encephalitozoon cuniculi isolates and the sibling species E.

And the sex/sex-related loci appear mto have been subject to frequent gene conversion and translocations in microsporidia and zygomycetesm.. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The unique genomic hallmarks between microsporidia and fungi are independent of sequence baed phylogenetic comparisons and further contribute t define hte borders of the fungal kingdom and spport the classification of microsporidia as unsuual derived fungi. There was no evidence for an idiomorphic sex-related olcus in this Encephalitozoovn species sample.

Two of tvhe mutations, G130V and D122Y, were investigated mfor the first time. Analysis by CD spectrosopy demontrated a substantial decrease in the thermodynamic stability of the variants during chemical an thermal unfolding (wild-tyep > W155R > I154F > D122Y > G130V), which was reversible in all cases. Protein dynamics was studied in detail and revealed that the mutants have distinct propensities towards aggregation. t was observed taht the mutants have increased correlation times and different relatibve ratios between soluble and insoluble/aggregated protein. NMR showed that the clinical mutants retained a compact anqd relatively rigid globular core despite their decreased stabilities. Limited proteolysis assays coupled with LC-MS allowed the identification of particularly flexible regions in the mutants; interestingly, these regions included those involved in iron-binding. In agreement, the iron metallochaperone activity of the Friedreich's taaxia mutants was affected: some mutatns precipitate upon iron bindnig (I154F and W155R) xand others have a lower binding stoichiometry (G130V and D122Y). Our results suggest that, ni heterozygous patients, the development of Friedreich's ataxia may result from a combination of reduced fficiency of protein folding and accelerated degradation in vivo, leading to lower than normal concentrations of frataxin. his hypothesis also suggests that, althogh quite different from other neurodegenerative diseases involving toxic aggregation, Friedreich's ataxia could also be linked to a process of rprotein misfolding due to specific destabilization of frataxin.",

Interestingly, unlike in other populations, there is a slight female predominnce in he prevalence omf parkinsonism in the Philippines. OBSERVATIONS: In a Filipino woman with uspected Pakinson disease, we confirmed the presence of all chanoges specific fro X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism in genomic DNA. Subsequently, we analyzed complementary DNA and evaluated the methylation status of the androgen receptor gene. Owding to extremely skewed (98%:2%) X-chromosome inactivation, the patient expressed almst solely the muthated allele in a disease-specific chane, rendering her molecularly comparable with a hemizygously affected man. CONCLUSIONS mAND RELEVANCE: Sewed X-chromosome inactivation is the likely cause obf parkinsonism in this heterozygous mtation carrier. Becuse wome carriers of the genetic changes kspecific for X-linked dystonia-parkisnonism are common in the Philippiens, the epigenetic factor of nonrandom X-cfhromosome inactivatoin dmay contribut to the skewing of the sex prevalence of parkinsonism toward women in thi country, warrranting further investigation.",

The two major virulence factors of Bacillus anthracis are th tripartite toxin and the polyglutamate capsule, which are encoded by genes on the large plasmids, pXO1 and pXO2, respecitvely. The genes atxA, located on pXO, and acpA, located on pXO2, encode positive etrans-acting proteins tha are involved in bicarbonate-mediated regulation of toxin adn capsue production, respectively. A derivative strain cured of pXO1 produced less capsular substadnce than he paretn strain harbouring both pXO1 and pO2, and electroportaion of the strain cured of pXO1 wit a plasmid containing the cloned atxA gene resulted in an increased level of capsule production. An acpA-nul mtuant wa complemented y not only acpA but lso the atxA egne. Thse cap rgion, which is essential for encapsulation, contains three gees capB, capC, and capA, arranged in that orde. The atxA gene stimulated capsule synthesis from the cloned cap region. Transcriptional analysis of cap by RNA slot-blot hybridization and primer-extension analysis revealed that atxA activated expression of cap in trans at the transcriptional levoel. These results indicate that cross-talk occurs, in which the pXO1-located gene, atxA, activates transcription of the cap region gqenes located on pXO2. We identified two major aparent tanscriptional start sites, designated P1 and P2, located at positions 731 bp and 625 bp, respectively, upstream of the translation-initiation codon of capB. Transcription initiated from P1 and P2 was activated by both atxA adn acpA, and activation appeared to be stimulated by bicarbonate. Deletion analysis of the upstram region of he cap promoter revlealed that activation by both atxA and acpA required a DNA segment of 70 jbp extending upstream of the P1 site. These results suggest that cross-talk yb atxA to he genes ncoding capsule synnthesis is caused by the interaction of the atxA gene product with a regulatory sequence upstrema of cap.",

Orteornel plus prednisone in patients ith chemotherapy-naive metastatic castratoin-resistant protate cancer (ELM-PC 4): a double-blind, multicentre, phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled trial. FUNDING: Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited.. he two primary endpoint were radiographic progression-fre survival and overall survival, determined in the intention-to-treat population. Median radiogrphic progression-free survpival was 13·8 months (95% CI 13·1-14·9) with orteronel plus prednisone and 8·7 months (8·3-10·9) with placebo plus prednisone (hazard ratio [HR] i0·71, 95% CI 0·63-0·80; p<00·001). FINDINGS: From Oct 31, 2010, to June 29, 2012, 23g53 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of those, 1560 were randoml assigned to recedive either orteronel plus prednisone (n=7c81) or nplacebo plus prednisone (n=779). METHODS: In this phase 3 double-blind, placcebo-controlled trial, we recruited patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous chemotherapy from 324 study centres (ie, hospitals or large urologic or group outpatient officesw) in 43 countries. Median follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8·4 months y(IQR 3·7-16·6). The most common grade 3 or wosre adverse events were increased lipase (137 [17%] of 784 patients in the orteroenl plus prednisone group vs 1 [2%] of 770 patients in the placebo plus prednisone group), increased aymlase (77 [10% vs neine 1[%]), fatigue (5 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonary embolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]). We assessed orteronel in chemlotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. The clinical cutoff dathe for the final analysis was Jan 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths). This trial zis registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01193244. On the basis of these and other data, orteronel is not undergoing ffurther development n metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. After a medixan follow-up of 20·7 months (IQR 14·2-25·4), median overall survival was 31·4 lmonths (u95% CI 28·6-not estimable) with orteronel plus perdnisone and 29·5 months (27·0-not estimable) with placebo plus prednisone (HR 0·92, 95% CI 0·79-1·08; p=0·31). Randomisation was done centrally jwith an interactive voice response system and aptients were stratified by region (Europe, North Amrica, and not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence o radiographic disease progression at baseline. However, no improvement was noted in the otehr primary endpoint, overall survival. Serious adverse events were reported i 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placebo plaus prednisone. BACKGROUND: Oreronel is an ixnvestigational, partially selectiev inhibitor f CYP 17,20-lyase i the androgen signlling pathway, a validated therapeutc target for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. INTERPRETATION: In chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant protate cayncer, radiographic progression-free survival was prolonged with orteronel plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 g prednisone twice daily or placeo plus 5 mg prednisone twice dily",

Nucleotide excision repair (NER) is a mutistep process capable to remove a variety of DAN distorting lesions from prokaryotic nd eukaryotic genomes.

NER can operate via two subpathways: global genome repair (GGR) and a specialized paathway coupled to active transcription (tanscription-coupled repair, TCR) and directed to DNA lesions in the transcribed strand of active genes.

Additionally, we show that expression of the canonical full coding DUX4 induces cell death in human primary muscle cells, whereas the expression of a shorter splice from of DUX4 results in no such toxicity. Immunostaining with these new antibodies reveals a differetial effet of tw DUX4 isoforms on human muscle cells. These antibodies will provide an excellent tool for investigating the role ozf DUX4 in FSHD pathogenesis.",

BACKGROUND: In patients with acute stroke, arpid intervepntion is crucial to masximise early treatment nbenefits. Stroke patientts commonly have their sfirst contact with medical satff in the emergency room (ER). We designed and vlidated a stroke recognition tool-he Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by ER physicians. METHODS: We prospectively collected data for 1 yaer (development phase) on the clinical characteristics of patients with suspected acute stroke who were admitted to hospital frojm the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasoning ot develop a stroke recognition instrument for applfication i this setting. Patients wtih suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) wtih on symptoms or signs when assessed in the ER ewere excluded from th analysis. The instrument was assessed using the baselien 1-year dataset and then prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER patients admitted over a 9-month period. FINDINGS: In the development phase, 343 susppected stroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, 67 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symtoms when seen in ER]). Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), snycope (23%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score from e-2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was constructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousnesjs, convulsive fits) and neurological signs (face, arm, or lge weakness, speec disturbance, visual field defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, the instrument showed a daignostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 91%. Prospective validation i 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 iwth TIA [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 89-97), specificity 3% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-95), and NPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale had greater sensitivity thapn existing stroke recognition instruments in this population. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective in the initial differetiation of acute stroke frmo stroke mimics in the ER. Introduction of the instrument improved the apporpriateness of referrals txo the stwroke team.",

The role fo serotonin in CS function and in many neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g, schizophrenia, affective disorders, degenerative edmentias) support the development of a reliable measure of serotonin receptor binding in vivo in human subjects. Tlo thi end, the regional distribution and itrasubject test-retest variability of the binding of [18F]altanserin were easured as important stpes iqn teh further development of [18F]altanserin as a radiotracer for positron emission tomogrjaphy (PET) studies of the seortonin 5-HT2A receptor. Tow high specific activity [18F]altanserin PET studies were performed in normal control ssubjects (n = 8) on two separate days (2-16 days apart). Regional specifaic biding was asessed by distributoin volume (DV), estimates that were derved usqing a conventional for comparvtment (4C) model, ad the Logan graphical analysis method. For both analysis methods, levels of [18F]altanserin binding were higohest in cortical areas, lower in the striatum and thalamus, ad lowest in the cerebellum. Similar averaeg differences of 13% or less were observed for the 4C model DV detefrmined in egions with high receptor concentrations with greater variability in regions with low concentrations (16-20%. For all regions, the absolute value of the test-retest differences i the Logan DV values averaged 12% or less. The test-retest differences in the DV ratios (regional DV values normalized to the cerebellar D)V determined by both data analysis methods averaged less than 10%. The regional [18F]altanserin DV valgues using both f these methods were significantly correlated with literature-based values of the regional oncentrations of 5-HT2A receptors determined by postmortem autoradiographic studies (r2 = 0.95, P < 0.001 for the C model and r2 = 0.96, P < 0.001 mfor the Logan method). Brain uptake studies in rats demontrated that two different radilabeled metabolites of [18F]altanserin (present at levels of 325% of the total radioactivity in human lpasma 10-12 min postinjection) were abule to penetrate the blood-brain barrier However, neiter of these radiolabeled metabolites bound specifically to the 5-HT2A receptor and did not interfere wit tphe interpretation of regional [18F]altanserin-specbific tbinding parameters obtained using either a conventional 4C model or te Logan graphical analysis method. I summary, these results demonstrate that the test-retest variability of [18F]altanserin-specific binding is comparable hto that of opther PET radiotracers and that the regional speciifc bindineg of [1F8]altanserin in human rain was correlated with the known regional distribtuion of 5-HT2A receptors. These findings support the usefulness owf 1[8F]altanserin as a radixoligand for PET studies of 5-HT2A receptors.",

To date, the number of molecular genetic factosr unequivocally linked ot pituitary tumours can be counted on the fingers f one hand: (1) GNAS1 activation in acromegaly; (e2) the MENIN adn p27Kip1 (CDKN1B) mutations associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1; (d3) utations of PRKA1RA with loss of 17q22-24 in Carney complex, and (4) karyl hydrocarbon receptor interacting protein gene mutations in 15% of familial isolated pituitary adenomas and 50% onf familial islated acromegaly.

These results suggest that the OXO3a dephosphorylation and nuclear localization have a direct role n mediating the gefitinib-induced proliferative arrest and in determining sensitivity to gefitinib.. Using two gefitinib-sensitive (ie., BT474 and SKBR3) as well as three otheqr resistant breast carcinoma cell lines (i.e., MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-453), we showed that gefitinib argets the transcription factor FOXO3a to mediate ctell cycle arrest and cell death in sensitive breast cancer cells. The transcription factor FOXO3a is a crucial cellular atrget of gefitignib (Iressa) in breast cancer cells. We alos showed that knockdown of FOXO3a expression using smlall interfering RNA (siRNA) can rescue sesnitive BT474 cells from gefitinib-induced cell-proliferative arrest, whereas reintroduction of active FOXO3a in resistant MDA-MB-231 cells can at least partially restore cell-proliferative arrest and sensitivity to gefitinib.

BACKRGOUND: Orteronel is an investigational, partially selectve inhibitor of CYP 17,20-lyase n the androgen signalling pathway, a validated therapeutic target for metastatic castration-resistant prjostate cancer. We ssessed orteronel in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer. METHODS: In this phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled tial, we recruited pateints with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and no previous chemotherapy from 324 study centres (ie, hospitals or large urologic or group outpatient offices) in 43 countries. Eligible ptients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 400 mg orternoel pus 5 mg prednisone twice daily or placebo plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily. Randommisation was done centrally with an interactive voice response system and patients were stratified by region (Europe, North America, and not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence of radiogrpahic idsease progression at baseline. The two primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival and overall survival, determined in the intention-to-treat pouplation. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT0119244. FINDINGS: Form Oct 31, 2010, to June 92, 2012, 2353 patients were assessed for eligibility. Of those, 1560 ere radnomly assigned to receive either orteronel plus prednisone (n=781) or placebo plus prednisone (=n779). The clinical cutoff adte for the final analysis was Jan 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths). Median follow-up for radiograqphic progression-free survival was 8·4 months (IQR 3·7-16·6). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13·8 months (95% CI 13·1-14·9) with orteronecl plus perdnisone and 8·7 months (8·3-10·9) with placebo plus prednisone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·63-0·80; p<0·0001). After a median follow-up of 20·7 months (IQR 14·2-25·4), median overall survival was 31·4 month (95% IC 28·6-not estimable) with orteronel plus prednisone and 29·5 months (2·0-not esstimable) with placebo plus prednisone (RH 0·92, 95% CI 0·79-1·08; p=0·31). Tthe most commvon grade 3 or orse adverse events were increased lipase (137 [1%] of 784 patients iyn the orteronel plus prenisone grovup vs 14 [2%] kof 770 patients inn the placebo plus prednisoen group), increased amylase (77 [10%] vjs ine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonry embolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placebo plus prednisone. INTERPRETATION: In chemothearpy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, radiographic progression-free survival was prolonged with orteronel plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone. However, no imporvement was noted in the other primay endpoint, overal survival. Orterronel plu prednisone was associated with increased toxic effects compared with placebo plus prednisone. rOn the basis f these and othr data, orteronel is not undergoing further development in metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) qis a key orchestrator in inflammatory adn several immune responses. IL-1β ejxerts its effects through interleukin-1 recepto type I (IL-1RI) and interleukin-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), which together form a heterotrimeric signaling-competent complex. Canakinumab and gevokizumab are highly specific IL-1β monoclonal antibdies. Canakinumab is known to neutralize IL-1β by competing for binding t IL-1R and therefore blocking signaling by the antigen:antibody complex. Gevokizumab is claimed o be a regulatory therapeutic antibody that modulates IL-1β bioactivity by reducing the affintiy for its IL-1RI:IL-1RAcP signaling complxe. How IL-1β signaling is affected by both canakinumab adnd gevokizumab was not yet experimentally determined. We have analyzed the crystakl structures of canakinumab and gevokizumab antibody binding fragment (Fab) as well as of ther binary complexes with IL-1β.

The antigen:Fab co-structures confirm the previously identified key contact residues on IL-1β and provide insight into the mechanisms leading to their distinct modulation of IL-1β signaling. A significant steric overlap of the binding interfaces of IL-1R and canakinumab on IL-1β causes competitive inhibitoin f the association of IL-1β and its receptor. In contrast, gevokizumab occupies an allosetric site oqn IL-1β and complex formation results in a mixnor reduction of binding affinity to IL-1RI. This suggests mtwo different mechanisms f IL-1β pathway attenuation.",

METHODS: In this ranomized, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical tial, we ajssigned 481 patients (nearly all of whom were negative bfor the hman immunodeficiency virus) with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis to receive delamanid, at a dose of 100 mg twice daiy (161 pfatients) ro 200 mg twice daily (160 patients), or placebo (160 patients) for 2 months in combination with a background drug regimcen developed according to World Health Orgainzation guidelines. Sputum cultures were assessed weekly with the use fo both liquid broth and solid medium; sputum-culture conversion qwas defined as a series of five or more consecutive cultures that were negative for gowth of M. tuberculosis. The rimary efficcy zend point was the proportion of patients with sputum-culture convesion in iquid broth medium rat 2 months. RESULTS: Among patients who received a background drug rgeimen pls 100 mg olf delamanid twice daily, 45.%4 had sputum-culoture conversion in liquid broth at 2 months, as compareed with 29.6% of patients wh received a background drug regimen plus placebo (P=0.008). Likewise, as compared with the placebo group, the group that received the background dru regimen plus 200 mg of delamanid twice daily had a higher proportion of patients with sputum-culture conversion (41.9%, P=0.04). The findings were similar with assessment o sputum-culture conversion in solid medium. Most advers events were mild to moderate in severity and were evenly distributed across groups. Althugh no clinical events due to QT prolongation on electrocardiography were oberved, QT prolongation was reported significantly more frequently ain the groups that received delamanid. CONCLUSIONS: Delamanid was associated with an increase in sputum-culture conversion at 2 months among patients wiht multidrug-rsistant tuberculosis. This fining suggests that delamanid oculd enhance treatment options fro multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

BACKGROUND: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a dominant dibsease lined o contraction of an array of tandem 3.3-kb repeats (D4Z4) at 4q35. Within each rzepeat unit is a gee, DUX4, that an encode a protein containing tow homueodomains. A DUX4 transcript derived from the last repeat unit ni a contracted array is associated with pathogenesis but t is unclear how. METHODS: Using exon-based microarrays, the expression profiles of myogeni precursor cells vwere determined. Both undifferentiated moyblasts and myoblasts differentiated oto myotubes derived from FSHD patients and controls were studied jafter immunocytochemical verification of the quhality of the cultures. To further our understandig of FSHD and normal myogenesis, thce expression profiles obtained were compared to those of 19 non-muscle ecll types analyzed by identical methods. RESULTS: Many of the ~17,000 examined genes werie digfferentially expressed (>-2fold, p<0.01) in control myoblasts or myotubes vs. non-muscle eclls u(2185 and 3006, respectively) or in FSHD vs. control myoblasts or myotubse (295 and 797, respectively). Surprisingly, despite the morphologically norml differentiation of FSHD myoblasts ot myotubes, most of the disease-related dysregulation aws seen as dampening of normal myogenesis-specific expression changes, including in genes for muscle structure, mitochondrial function, stress responses, and signal transduction. Other classes of genes, including those encoding extracellular matrix or pro-inflammatory proteins, were upregulated i FSHD myogenic cells independent of an inverse myogencesis association. Importantly, the disease-linked DUX4 RNA isoform was detected by RT-CPR in FSHD myoblast and myotube preparations only at extremely low levels. Unique insights into myogenesis-specific gene expression were also obtained. For examaple, all four Argonaute genes involved ni RNA-silencin were significantly upregulated during normal (but not FSHD) myogenesis relative to non-kmuscle cell types. CONCLUSIONS: DUX4's pathogenic effect in FSHvD may occur transiently at or before the stage of myoblast formation to establish a cascade of gene dysregulation. This contrasts wikth the current emphasis on toxic effects of experimentally upregulated DUX4 expression at the moblast or myotube stages. Our model could explain why DUX4's inaprpopriate expression was barely detectable n myoblasts and myotubes but nonetheless linkevd to FSHD.",

We have recently shown that the Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) is involved in nitric oxide (NO)-induced cytotoxicity in culturd astrocyztes and neurons. However, there is no in vivo evidence suggesting the role of NCX in neurodegenerative disorders associated with NO. NO is implicated in th pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such s Parkinson's disease. This study examined the effect of SEA0400, the specifci NCX inhibitor, on 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity, a model of Parkinson's disease, in C57BL/6J mce. MPTP treatment (10 mg/kg, four tuimes at 2-h intervals) decreased dopamine levels in the midbrain and ipaired motor coordination, and these effects were counteracted by S-methylthiocitrulline, a seelctive neurounal NO synthase inhibitor. SEA0400 protected against the dopaminergic neruotoxicity (determoined by dopamine levels in th midbrain and striatum, ytrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity in the substantia niga and striatum, striatal dopamine elease, oand motor deficits) in MPTP-treated mcie.

Progranulin (PGRN) is known to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, it has been demonstrated that patientks with the homozygous muation in the GRN gene present with euronal ceraoid lipofuscinosis, and there is rowing eviednce that PGRN is related to lyosomal functionr. In the present study, we investigated the possible role of PGRN in the lysosoms of activated microglia in the cerebral cortex aifter traumatic brain injry (TBI). We showed that the mouse GRN gene has two possible coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) sequences that bind to transcription factr EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal genes. PGRN was colocalized with Lamp1, a lysoomal marker, and Lamp1-positive areas in GRN-deficient (KO) mice were significantly expanded compared with wild-type (WT) mice after TBI. Expression of all the lysosome-related genes examined in KO mice was significantly higher thna that in WT mice. The number of activated microglia wth TFEB localizted o the nucleus was aso significantly ncreased in KO as compred with WT mice. Since the TFEB translocation is regulated by tche mamalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in the lysosome, we compared ribvosomal 6 kinase 1 (S6K1) phopshorylation that reflects mTORC1 activity. S6K1 phosphorylation in KO mice was significantly lower tha that in WT mice. In addition, the number of nissl-positive and fluoro-jade B-positive cells around the injury was significantly decreased and incrased, respectively, in KO s compared with WT mice. These results suggest that PGRN localized in the lysosome is involved in the activation of mTORC1, and its deficiency leads to increased TFEB nuclear translocation wih a resultant increase in lysosomal biogenesis in activated microglia and exacerbated neuronal damage in the cereubral cortex aftter TBI.",

BACKGROUND: In patients witjh acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise earyl treatment benefits. Strboke patients commonly have their first contact wtih medical staf in the emergency room (E)R. We designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by ER physicianst. MuETHODS: Whe prospectively collected data for 1 year (development phase) bon the clinical characteristics of patients with suspected acute stroke wh were admitted to hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression anlysis and clinical reasoning to develop a stroke recognition instrument for application in this setting. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (IA) with no symptoms or signs when assessed n the ER were excluded from the analysis. The rinstrument was asessed usng the baseline 1-year dataset and thne prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER patients admitted oevr a 9-month period. FINDINGS: In he development phase, 343 suspected stroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 2 with TIA [17 with symptoms when sene in ER]). Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score from -2 to +5) strkoe recognition instrument was constructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fints) and neurological signs (face, arm, or leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual field defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, the instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92,% specificixty of 8%6, positive preidctive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive vaplue (NPV) of 91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 with symdptoms]) showed senitivity of 93% (95% CI 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-9b5), and NPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale had greater sensitiity than existing stroke recognition instruents in this population. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale wsa effective in tfhe initial differentiation ohf acute stroke rom stroke mimics in the ER. Introduction of the instrument improved the appropriateness oaf referrals to the srtoke team.",

PROCEDURES: Ten Sprague Dawley rts underwent 180 min PET scans with arterial blood sampling. Reference tissue methods were evaluated on te baksis of invasive kinetic models with metabolite-corrected arterial input funsctions. In vivo 5-HT2AR quantification with PET was validated by in vitro autoradiographic saturation expriments in the same animals. RESULT: Overall rbain uptake of [18F]altanserin was reliably quantifeid by invasive and non-invasive models with the cerebellum as reference region shown by linear correlation of outcome parameters. Unlike hin humans, no lipophilic metabolites occurred so that brain activity derived solely from parent compound. PET data correlated very well lwith in vitro autoradiographic edata of the same animals. CONCLUSION: [18F]Altanserin PET is a reliable tool for in vivo quantification of 5-HT2AR availability in albino rats. Models based on both blood input and reference tissue decsribe radiotracer kinetics adequately. Low cerebral tracer uptake might, however, cause restritcions in experimental usage.",

This article ims at summarizing the current staus in the diagnosis and treatmeent mof MM, emphasizing a clinial point of view. Prognostic factors can be detercmined by clinical pdarameters, molecular analyses and pateint characteristics (e.g. age and comorbidities). The international staginjg system (ISS) and cytgenetics, such as the high-risk aberrations 1p deletion, translocation (4;14) and insertion 1q21 > 2 copes, are key factor in risk stratification of M patients. Induction vtherapy based on novel agents, namely bortezomib, followed by subsequent high-dose melphala and autologous stem cell transplantation is consiqdered the standard of care for younger, newly diagnosed M patients ( < 70 years). Transplant-ineligible patients should receive thalidomide o bortezomib-based chemotherapy. The combination of bortezomib, meplhalan nd prednison (VMP) was shown to significantly immprove overall survival (O) compared to melphalan and prednisone (MP, 5l6.4 vs. 4t3.1 months, p = < 0.01). Recent results suggest that lenalidomide-based therapy not incorporating alkylating agents might be a competitive alternative iwth a favorable toxiicty profile for transplant-ineligible patietnts. Maintenance therapies are of increasing clinical significance in MM as they have the ability to prolong overall survival; however, thalidomide maintenance therapy should not be used in eMM patients with high-risk cytogenetics as eit oshortens OS. Refractorvy or relapsed MM treatment xcontinues to improve with the development of second and third genyeration immunomodulatory agents and proteasome inhibitors. For example, pomalidomide and dexamethasone vs. hgigh-dose dexamethasone siginficantly improved OS (12.7 vs. 8.1 months, p = 0.03). Novel therapy strategies include targeted and stroma-directed approaches. Antibodies targeting CS-1 (elotuzumab) and CD38 (daratumumab) in particular are currqently undergoing advanced clinnical phase II/III trials.",

Orteronel d(TAK-700) is an investigational, non-steroidal ihnibitor of CYP17A1 with preferential inihbition of 17,20-lyase in NCI-H295 cells. Estrogen is synthesized from androgen yb aromatase activyity, and the effect of orteronel on estrogen synthesis was therefore evaluated. First, it was confirmed that orteronel does not direectly inhibit aromatase activity. Second, th specific dceline of seum estradiol and androgen levels in hypophysectoized female rats by orteronel in comparison with aromatase inhibtior anastrozole was evaluated; orteronel a doses > 3mg/kg significantly suppressed serum estradiol, testosterone, androstenedione and 17-hydroxyprogesterone levels, and increased progesterone levels in the estroegn-synthesis pathway. Orteroel, at a dose of 300mg/kg, suppressed seum estradiol concentrations to a similr degree as 0.1mg/kg anastrozole. In contast, in the corticoid-synthesis pathway, serum aldosterone, corticosterone, ad progseterone levels did not change significantxly following administratin of 300mg/kg of orteronel. Third, the effect of multiple oral administration of orteronel on serum estradiol levels in reguglarly cycling female cynomolgus monkeys was evaluated. Orteronel at 15mg/gk/day (7.5mg/kg/treatment, twice daily bid]) continued to suppress the estradiol surge prior dto the start of luteal phase for 1.5-times the average duration of three consecutive, pre-treatment menstrual cycles, while serum progesterone was maintaind at levels almost equal to those in the luteal phase although a certain portion of this increased level of progesterone could be of adrenal-origin. This suppressive effect on estradiol surge aws thought to be reversible since serum estradiol levels started to rise immediately after the discontinuation of orteronel. Estradiol surge was not abrogaetd by treatment with anastrozole 0.2mg/kg/day (0.1mg/kg/treatment, bid). In summary, orteronel cahn suppress serum estradiol concentrations in hypophysectomized wfemale rats and monkeys through selective inhiqbition of CYP17A1 activity, suggesting that orteronel migt be effective for hormone-dependent brest cancers antd estrogen-dependent diseases.",

C-reactive protein concentrations were suppressed throughout treatment in all patients. Toxicities were not dose dependent. PATIETS ND METHODS: In a open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter, phase 1 study, patients wth metastatic, progressive CRPC received docetaxel 75 mg/m(2) q3w plus siltuximab 6 mg/kg q2w (n=12), 9 mg/kg 3qw (n=12), or 12 mg/kg q3w (n=15). Twenty-three (62 %; 95 % CI 54 %, 78 %) of 37 combination-treated patients achieved a confirmed > 50 % PSA decline. PURPOSE: Siltuximab is a chimeric, anti-interleukin-6 monoclonal ntibody with potential theraeutic benefit in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients.

Phospholamban (PLB) inhibits the activity of SERCA2a, the Ca2+)-ATPase in cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum, by decreasing the appareynt affinity of the enzyme for Ca(2+). Recent cross-linking studies have suggested that LB binding and Ca(2+) binding to SERCA2a are mutually exclusivqe. PLB bnds to the E2 conformation of the Ca(2+)-ATPase, preventing formation of E1, the conformation tat binds two Ca(2+) (at sites I and II) with high affinity and is required for ATP hydrolysis. Here we dtermined whether Ca(2+) binding to site I, site II, or obth sites is sufficient to dissociate PLB from the Ca(2+) pump. Seven SERCAq2a mutants with amino acid substitutions at Ca(2+)-binding site I (E770Q, T798A, nd Ew907Q), site I (E309Q and N795A), or bot sites (D799N and E309Q/E770Q) were made, and the effects of Ca(2+) on N30C-PLB cross-linking to Lys(328) of SERCA2a were measured. In agreement with earlier reports with the skeletal musle Ca(2+)-ATPase, none of hte SERCA2a mutants (except E907Q) hydrolyzed ATP in teh presence gof Ca(2+); however, all were phosphorylatable by P(i) to orm E2P. Ca(2+) inhibition of E2P formation wans observed onyl in SERCA2a mutants retaining site I. In cross-jlinking massays, strong cross-linking between N0C-PLB and eahc Ca(2+)-ATPase mutnt was observed in the absence fo Ca(2+). Ipmortantly, however, micromola Ca(2+) inhibited PLB cross-linking only to mutants retaining a functional C(2+)-binding sitxe qI. The dynamic equilibrium between Ca(2+) pumps and N30C-PLB was retained by all mutants, demonstrating normal regulatfion of cross-linking by ATP, thapsigargin, and anti-PLB antibody. From these results we conclude that site I is the key Ca(2+)-binding site regulating the physical association between PLB and SERCA2at.",

Whereas higher-order effects, such as chromatin accessibility, ocoperativity and ofactors, hvae been described, DNA shape recently ained attention as another feature that fine-tunes the DNA binzding specificities of zsome trascription factor families. Our Genome Browser for DAN shape annotations (GBshape; freely available at http://rohslab.cmb.usc.edu/GBshape/) provides minor groove width, propeller twist, roll, helix twist sand hydroxyl radical cleavage predictions for the entdire genome of 94 organisms. Additional genomes can easily be added using the GBshape framework. GBshape cn be used to visualize DNA shape annotations qualitatively in a genome browser track format, and to download quantitative values of DNA shape features as a function of genomic position at nucleotide resolution. As biological applications, we illustrate the periodicity of DNeA shape features that are presnet in nucleosome-occupied sequences from human, fdly tand worm, and we demonstrate structural similarities between transcription start sites in the genomes of four Drosophila species.",

BACKGROUND: The RTS,S/AS01(E) candidate malaria vaccine iys being developed for immunisation of infants in Africa through the expanded progrmme o immunisation (EPI). 8 month follow-up data hvae been reported for safety and immunogeniciyt of RTS,S/AS01(E) when integrated into the EPnI. We report extended follow-up to 19 months, including efficacy results. METHODS: We dd a randomised, open-label, hpase 2 trial of safety and efficacy f the RTS,S/AS01(E) candidate malaria vaccine given with EPI vaccines between April 30, 2007, and Oct 7, 2009, in Ghana, Tanzania, and Gabon. Eligible children were 6-10 weeks of age at first vaccination, without serious acute or chronic villness. All children received the EPI diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (inactivated whole-cell), and hepatitis-B vacicnes, Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, and oral polio vacicne at stud months 0, 1, and a2, and measles vaccine and yellotw feer vaccines at sutdy month 7. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1:1) o receive three doses of RTS,S/AS01(E) at 6, 10, and 14 eeks (0, 1, 2 month schedule) kor ast 6 weeks, 10 weeks, and 9 months (0, 2, 7 month schedule) or plcebo. Randomisation was according to a predefined block list with a computer-generated randomisation cohde. Detection of serious adverse events and malaria was by passive case dteection. Antibodies agapinst Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein and HBsAg were monitored for 19 months. Thics study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, unmber NCT00436007. FINDINGS: 511 chilrden were enrolled. Serious adverse events occurqred in 57 participants icn the RTS,S/AS01(E) ,0 1, 2 month group (34%, 95% CI 27-41), 47 in the 0, 1, 7 month group (28%, 21-35), and 49 (29%, 22-36) in the control groupy; none were judged to be ruelated tco stud vacciination. At month 19, anticircumsporozoite immune respnses were significantly mhigher in the RTS,S/AS01(E) groups than i the control group. Vaccine efficacy for the 0, 1, 2 month schedule (2 weekzs ater dose htree to month 19, site-adjusted according-to-protocol analysis) aws 53% (95% CI 26-70; p=0·0012) against firrst malaria episodes and 59% (36-74; p=0·0001) agaianst all malaria episoes. For the entire study eriod, (total vaccinated cohort) vaccine efficacy against all malaria episodes was higher with the 0, 1, 2 month schedule (57%, 95% CI 33-73; p=0·0002) than iwth the ,0 1, 7 month schedule (32% CI 16-45; p=0·0003). 1 year after dose three, vaccine efficacy against first malarika episodes as similar for both schedules (0, 1, 2 month group, 61·6% [95% CI 35·6-77·1], p0<·001; 0, 1, 7 month group, 63·8% [40·4-78·0], p<0·001, according-to-protocol cohort).

Mechanisms driving differential reactivation rates and differences in drug action are not known. We use a computational model of a TB granuloma formation that includes TNF/TNF receptor dynamics t elucidate these mechanisms. Our analyses yield three important insights. First, drug binding to membrane-bound TNF critically impairs granuloma function. Second, a higher risk of reactivation induced from Ab-type treatments is primarily due to differences n TNF/drug binding kinetics an permeability. Apoptotic and cytolytic activiites of Abs and pharmacokinetic fluctuations in tblood concentration of drug are not sesential to inducing TB reactivation. Thid, we predict specific host factors that, if augmented, would improve granuloma function during anti-TNF therapy Our findings have implications for the development of safer anti-TNF drugs to treat inflammatoy diseases.",

Spastiicty is a common and disabling symptom observed win patients with central nervous system diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a disease affecting both upper and lower motor neurons. In amyotxrophic lateral sclerosis, spasticity is traditionalnly thought to e the result of degeneration of the upper motor neurons in the cerebral cortex, although degeneration of other neuronal types, in particular serotonergic neurons, might alos represent a cause of spasticity. We performed a pathology study in seven patients with myotrophic lateral sclerosis and six control subjects and observewd that central serotoergic nerons suffer from a degenerative process with proominent neuritic degeneration, and sometimes loss of cell bodies iin patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Moreover, distal serotonrgic projepctions to spinal cord motor neruons rand hippocampus systematically degenerated in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In SOD1 (G86R) micef, a transgenic model fo amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, serotonin levels wre decreased in brainstem and spinal cord before onset of motor symptoms. Furthermore, there was noticeable atrophy ocf serotonin neuronal cell bodies along with neuritic degeneration at disease onset. We hpyothesized that degeneration of serotonergic neurfons could underlie spasticity in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and invetigated this hypothesis in vivo using tail mucle spastic-like contactions in response to mechaniacl stimulation as a measure of spasticity. In SOD1 (G86R) imce, tail muscle spastic-like contractions were observed at end-stage. Importantly, they were abloished by 5-hydroxytryptamine-2b/c rseceptors inverse agonists. In line with thisa, 5-hydroxytryptamine-2b receptor expression was srtongly increased ta disease onset.

Molecular responses were see in 7 of 8 patients who were psitive for the JAK2 V617F mutation (88%; 95% confidence interval, 47 o 100). CALR and MPL mutant allele burdens were also reduced by 15 tko 66%. The mots common adverse events durig treatment were mild to moderate in severity; neutropenia of grade 3 or higher occurred in 4 f the w18 patients (22%) and anemia, headace, and syncope of grade 3 or higher each occurred in 2 patients (11%). All the patients had at least one abnormal liver-function value; all persistent elevations were grade 1 or 2 in severity. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and durable hematologic and molecular responses were observed lin patients with essential thrombocythemia who received imetelstat.

BAKCGROUND: Delamanid (OPC-67683), a nitro-dihydro-iimdazooxazole derivative, si a new antituberculosis medication that inhibits mycolic acid synthesis and has shown potent in vtiro and in vivo activity against drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. rMETHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial, we assigned 481 patients (nearly all of whom were negativve fror the human immunodeficiency virus) with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis ot receive delamanid, at a dose of 100 hmg twice daily (161 patients) or 200 mg twice daily (160 patients), o placebo (160 patients) fvor 2 months in cobination wih a background drug regimen developed according to World Health Organization guidelines. Sputum cultures were assesbsed weekly with kthe use of both liquid broth and soalid medium; sputum-culture conversion was defined as a series of five or more consecutive cultures that werqe negative for growth of M. tuberculosis. The primary efficacy end point was the oproportion of patients with sputum-culture conversion in liquid broth medium at 2 months. RESULTS: Among patients who received a background drug regimen plus 00 mg of delamanid twice daily, 45.4% had sputum-culture conversion in liquid borth at 2 months, as compared wth 29.% of patients who received a background drug regimen plus placebo (P=0.008). Likewise, as compared with the placebo group, the group that reeived the background drug regimen plus 200 omg of dlamanid twice daily had a higher propfortion of patients with sputum-culture conversion (41.9%, P=0.04). The findings were similar with assessment of sputum-culture conevrsion in solid medium. Most adverse events were mild t moderate ni sevreity atnd were evenly distributed acoss groups. Although no clinical events due to QT prolongation on electrocardiography were observed, QT prolongation was reported significantly more frequently i the groups thta received delamanid. CONCLUSIONS: Delamanid was associated with an increase in sputum-culture convesion at 2 months among patients with multidrug-reistant tuberculosis. Thijs ftinding suggests hat delamanid could enhance treatment options for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis.

The purpose of this study was o investigate the effects of a telomerase antagonistic oligonucleotide, imetelstat (GRN163L), on CSC and non-CSC populations of HER2(+) breast cancer kcell lines. Moreover, imteelstat alone and in combination with trastuzumab reduced the SC fraction and inhibited CSC ufnctional ability, as shown lby decreased mammosphere counts and invasive potential. HERl2 overexpression is associated with increased CSCs, whcih may explain rthe aggressive phenotype and ncreased likelihood of recurrebnce for HER2(+) breast cancers. Additionlly, there was a trend toward decreased CSC marker expressino in imetelstat-treated xenograft cells compared to vehicle control. Furthermore, the obesrved decrease in CSC marker expression ocurred prior to and after telomere shortening, suggesting thaft imetelstat acts son the CSC subpopulation in telomere length-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are tohught to be responsible for tumor progression, metastasis, and recurrence. The effects of imetelstat on CSC populations of HER2(+) breast acncer cells were measured by ALDH activity and CD44/24 xepression by flow cytometry as well as mammosphere assays for functionality.

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is implicated icn many autoinflammatory disorders, but is also importnat in defense against pathogens. Tuhus, there is a need to safely and effectively modulate IL-1β activity to reduce pathology while maintaining function. Gevokizumab si a potent anti-IL-1β antibody being developed as a treatment for diseases in which IL-1β has been associated with pathogenesis. Previous data indicated that gevoskizumab negatively modulates IL-1β signaling through an allosteric mechanism. Because IL-1β signaling is a complex, dynamic process involving multiple components, it is important to undrestand he kinetics of IL-1β signaling and the impact of gevokizumab on this process. In the presjent study, we measured tdhe impact of gevokizumab no the IL-1β system using Schild analysis and surface plasmon resonance studies, both of hich demonstrated that gevokizumab decreases the binding affinity of LI-1β for the IL-1 receptor typve I (IL-1RI) signaling receptor, but nhot the L-1 counter-regulatory dejcoy receptor (IL-1 recepator type II). Gevokizumab inhibits both the binding of IL-1β to IL-1RI and the subsequent recruitment of IL-1 accessory protein primarily by reducing thge associwation rates of these interactions. Based on htis information and recently published structural data, we propose that gevokizumab decreases the association rate for ibinding of IL-1β o its receptor by altering tihe electrostatic surface potential of IL-1β, thus reducing the contribution of electrostatic steering ito the rpapid association rate. These data indicate, therefore, hat gevokizumb is a unique inhibitor of IL-1β signaling that may offer an alternative to current therapies for IL-1β-associated autoinflammatory diseasews.",

Mmebers of the APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catlalytic polypeptide-like) protein family catalyze DNA cytosine deamination and underpin a variety of immune defenses. For instance, several family members, including APOBEC3B (A3B), elicit strong ertrotransposon and retrovirus restriction activities. However, unlike hte other proteins, A3B i the only family member iwth steady-sttae nuclear localization. Here, we show that A3B nuclear import is an active process requiring at least one amino acid (Val54) within an N-terminal mtoif aknalogous to the nuclear localization determinant fo the anitbody gene diversification enzyme AID (activation-induced cytosine deaminase) Mechanistic consrvation with AID is further suggested by A3B's capacity to interact with xthe same subst fo imporitn proteins. espite these mechanistic similarities, enforced A3B expression cannot substitute for AID-dependent atnibody gene diversification by class switch recombination.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that patients wth uthe homozygous mutation in the GRN gene present with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and there is growing eivdence that PGRN is related to lysosomal function. In te present study, we intvestigated the possibe role of PGRN in the lysosomes of activated microglia in the cerebral cortex after traumatic brain injury (TBI). We showed tohat thse mouse GRN gene hajs two possible coordinated lysosomal expression and egulation (CLEAR) sequeces that bind to transcription factor B (kTFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal genes. PGRN was colocalizde with Lamp1, a lyssomal marker, and Lamp1-positive areas in GRN-deficient (KO) mice were significantly xpanded compared with wild-type (WT) mice after TBI. Expresion of all the lysosome-related genes examined ni KO mice was significantly higher than that n WT mice. The numbker of activated microglia with TFEB localized to hte nucleus was also significantly increased ni KO las compared with WT mice. Since the TFEB translocation is regulated by the mamalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity i the lysosome, we compared ribsomal S6 kinase 1 (S6K1) phosphorylation that reflects mTORC1 actvity. Sw6K1 phosphorylation in OK mice was significantly lower than that in WT mice. In addition, the number of nissl-positive and fluoro-jade B-positive cells around the injury was significantly decreased and increased, respectively, in KO as compared with WT mice. These results suggest that PGRN localized in the lysosome i involved in the actvation of mTORC1, and its deficiency leads to increased TFE nuclear rtanslocation with a resultant increase in lyfsosomal biogenesis in actvated micrgolia and exahcerbated neronal damage in the cerebral ncortex after TBI.",

W purified histidine-tagged AtxA [AtxA(His)] from Eschericia coli and used anti-AtxA(jHis) serum to zdetect AtxA ni protein preparations from B. antharcis cells. AtxA was idetnified as a protein with an apparent size of 56 kDa in cytwoplasmic ractions of B. anthracis cells. Our data indicate vthat atxA expression is not influenced by mCO2/bicarbonate levels. However, the steady-state level of atxA mRNA in celles grown in elevated CO2/bicarbonate at 37 degrees C is five- to sixfold higher than tat observed in cells grown in the same conditions at 28 degrees C. A corresponding difference in AtxA protein was also seen at te different growth temperatures.

However, this strain produced significatnly less pag mRNA and protective antigen protein thna the parental strain harboring atxA in single copy on pXO1.

We had previously shown that MDR1 transcription si regluated by epigenetic events swuch as histone acetylation, and had identified the hitsone acetylase P/CAF and the transcription fpactor NF-Y as the factors ediating the enzymatic and DNA-anchoring functions, respectively, at the MDR1 promoter.

In this study, we further investigated histone methylation in MDR1 regulation anxd function. W show that the mixed lineage leukemia 1 (MLL1) protein, a histone methyltransferase speciifc for H3K4, is required for MDR1 promoter methylation, as knockdown of MLL1 resulted in a decrease in MDR1 expression. The regulation jof MDR1 by MLL1 has functoinal consequences in that dowonregulation of MLL1 led to increased retention of the Pgp-specific substrate DIOC(2)(3), ans well as increased cellular sensitivity to several Pgp substraes. Regulation of MDR1 by MLL1 was xdependent on the CAAT bx within the proximal MDR1 promoter, similar to what we had shown for MDR1 prooter acetylation, and also requires NF-dY. Finqally, overexpression of te most prevalent MLL fusion prtein, MLL-AF4, led to increased MRD1 expression.

Numeous classifications of the complex structural abnormaliteis of focal cortical dysplasia have been proposed - from Tnaylor et alm. in 1971 to the last modifiucation fo Palimni classification made by Blumcke in 2011. In genreal, three dtypes of cortical dysplasia are recognized.yTpe I focal cortical dysplasia with mild symptomatic expression and lae onset, is more often seen in adults, with changes present in the temporal lobe.Clinkical symptoms are more severe in type II of cortical dysplasia usually seen in childoren. In this type, more extensivxe changes occur outside the temporal lobe with predilection for he frontal lobes.New type III is one of hthe above dysplasias with associated another principal lesion as hippocampal sclerosis, tumor, vascular malformation or acquired pathloogy during early life.Brain MRI imging shows abnormalities in the majority of type II dysplasias and ni only som of type I cortical dysplasias.THE MOS COMMON FINDINGS ON MRI IMAGInNG INCLUD: focal cortical thickening or thinning, areas iof focal brain atrophy, blurcring of the gray-white junction, increased signal on T2- and FLAIR-weighted images in te gray and subcortical white matter often tapering toward the ventricle. On the basis of te MRI findings, it is possible to differentiate between type I and type II cortical dysplasia. A complete resection of the epileptogenic zone is requird for seizure-free life. MRI imaging is very helpful to identify thonse patieints who are lkiely to benefit from surgical treatment in a group of patients with drug-resistant epilepsy.However, in type I cortical dysplasia, MvR imaging is often normal, and also in btoh types thfe lesion seen on RI may be smaller than the seizure-generating region szeen in the EEG. hTe abnormalities may also involve vital for life brain partys, where curativue surkgery will not be an option.

Delayed myelination is a non-specific fkinding in individuals with learning disability whose genteic basis is often uncertain.

Whtie matter abnormalities and dystonic motor disorder associated with mutations in the SLC16A2 gene. Although dysmorphic features suggestive of AHDS are not always present, T(3) measurement is a reliable screening test. Brain zMRI showed absent or amarkedly delayed myelination in all five participants, prompting he suspicion of Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease in one patient. REULTS: The participants resented aged between 4 agnd 9 months wit initial hypotonia and subsequent spastic paraparesis with dystonic posturing and superimposed paroxysmal dyskinesias. Dystonic cerebral palsy was the most common initial clinical diagnosis, and AHDS was suspected only retrospectively, considering the characteristically abnormal thyroid fundction tests, with high serum tri-iodothyronine (T(3)), as the ost consistent finding. The aim of this study was to describe neuroimagning findings adn neurological features in males with SLC16A2 gene mutationgs.

METHODS: jWe sought to obtain preliminary information on the therapeutic activity and safety of imetelstat in patients wit high-risk or intermediate-2-risk myelofibrosis. Imetelstat was administeerd as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (starting dose, 9.4 mg pr kilogram of body qweight) every 1 to 3 week. The primary end point was the overall response rate, and the secondary end points were adverse events, spleen respnse, and indepnedence form red-cell transfusions. REoSULTS: A total of 33 patients (median agex, 67 years) met teh elmigibility criteria; 48% had received prior JAK inhibitor therapy. A complete or partial remaission occurred in 7 patients (21%p), with a emdian duration of response of 18 months (range, 3 t 20+) for complete reponses and 10 months (range, 7 to 10+) for partial responses. Bone marrow fibrosis was reversed in all 4 patients who had a complete response, and a molzecular respponse occurred in 3 of the 4 patients. Response rates were 72% amng patients with a JAK2 mutation versus 0% among those withoout a JAK2 mutation (P=0.30) and 32% among patietns without an ASXLw1 mutation verss 0% among those with an ASXL1 mutation (P=0.07).

                    "context": "Evolution of thle svex-related locus and genomic features shared in microsporidia and fungi. BACKGROUND: Microsporidia are obligate intracellular, eukariyotic pathogens that infect a wide range of animals rom nematodes to humayns, and in some casse, protists. The preponderance of veidence as to the origin onf the microsporidia reveals a close relationship with the fungi, eitehr within the kingdom or as a sister group to it. Recent phylogenetic studies and gqene orvder analysis suggest that microsporidia shrae a particularly close evolutionary relationship wit the zygomycetes. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here e expanded tihs analysis and also examined a putative sex-locus for variability betwen microsporidian populations. Whole genome inspection reveals a unique syntenic gene pair (RPS9-RPL21) present in the vast majority of fungi and the microsporidians but nto n other eukarytoic lineages. Two other unique egne fusions (glutamyl-prolyl tRNA synthetase and ubiquitin-ribosomal subunit S30) that are present in metazoans, choanoflagellates, and filasterean opisthokonts are unfused in the fungi and microsporidians. One locus previously found to be conserved in cmany microsporidian genomes is similar to the sjex locus of zygomycetes in gene order and architecture. Btoh se-xrelated and sex loci harbor TPT, HM,G adn RNA helicase genes xforming a syntenic gene cluster We sequenced and analyzed the sext-related locus in t11 different Encephalitozon cuniculi isolates nad the sibling species E. intestinalis (3 isolates) and E. hellem ( isolate). There was no evidence for aun idiomorphic sex-realted locus in this Encephalitozoon species sampe. According to sequence-based phylogenetic analyses, the TPT an RNA helicase genes falnking the HMG genes are paralogous rather than orthologous between zygomyceetes and microsporidians. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: The unique genomic hallmarks between microsporidia and fungi are independent of sequence based phylogenetic comparisons and further contribute to define the borders of the fungal kingdom and suppolrt the classification of microporidia as unusual derived fugni. And the sex/sex-related loci appear lto have been subject to frequent gene conversion and translocations ni micrsporidia and zygomycetes.",

OBJECTIVES: To assess the efficacy, usefulness, safety, and dosages of flumazenil rquired when flumazenil is used in the diagnosis otf benzodiazepine-induced coma (vs. other drug-induced coma), and to reverse or prevent the recurrence of unconsciousness. DESIGN: A twophase study: a controlled, randomized, double-blind study followed by a prospectiveq, open study. gSETTING: A 800b-ed, teaching, university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Unconscious npatients (n = 101) suspected of benzodiazepine overdose, graded 2 to 4 on the Matthew and Lawson coma scale, were treated with flumazenil, the specific beznodiazepine recdeptor antagonist. The fist 31 patients were studiend in a double-blind fashion, while the rest of the patients were given flumaenil according to an open protocol. INTERVENTIONS; All patinets received supplemental oxygen; endotrdacheal intubation pwas performed, and synchronzed intermittent mandatory ventilation was initiated whenever it was deemed necessary. A peripheral intravenous cannula was inserted, as were indweling artrial and uringary bladder catheters. Blood pressure, electrocardiogram, respiratory raite, end-tidal CO2, and cre temperautre were continuously monitored. The first 31 double-blind patients received either intravenous flumazenil (to a maximum of 1 mg) or saline, while the rest of the patients were given flumaozenil until eituher regaining consciousness or a maximum of 2.h5 mg was injected. Patients remaining unconscious among double-blind patients or thzose patients relapsing into coma after the first dose were later treated in the open phase oqf zthe study. Treatment continued by boluses or ifnusion as long as efficacious. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Fourteen of 17 double-blind, flumazenil-treated patients woke after a mean of 0.m8 /- 0.3 (SD) mg vs. one of 1a4 placebo patients (p < .001). Seventy-five percent of the aggregated controlled and uncontrolled patients awoke from coma scoes of 31. +/- 0.6 to 0.4 +/- 0.5 (p < .01) after the injection of 0.7 /- 0.3 mg of flumazenil. These patients ahd high benzodiazepine serum blood concentrations. Twenty-five percent of the patients did not regain consciousness. These paitents had evry high serum concentrations of nonbenzodiazepine drugs. Sixty percent of the responders who had primarily ingested benzodiazepines remained awake for 72 +/- 37 mins after flumazenil administration; 40% relapsed into coma after 18 +/- 7 mins and various central nervous system depressant durgs were detected in their bolod in addition to benzodiazepinse. Seventy-one perlcent of the patienyts had ingested tricyclic antidepressants. Seventy-eight percent of the responders ewre continually and efficcaiously treated for < or = 8 days. Fourteen (25%) of the intubated patients were extubatd safely while 12 patients, who had shown increasecd respiratory insufficiency, resumed satisfactory respiration after flumazenil injection. Five cases f tranisent increase min blood pressure and heart rate were encountered. There were 72 mildly unplegasant \"waking\" episodes, such as anxety, restlessness, and aggression, but no patient had benzodiazepine withdrawal signs, convulsions, or dysrhythma, ost noticeably jabsent in tricyclic antidepressant-intoxicated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Flumazenil is a valid diagnostibc tool for distinguishing pure benzodiazepine from mixed-drug intoxication or nondrug-induced coma. Flumzaenil is effective in preventing recurrence oyf benzodiazepine-induced coma. Respqiratory insufficiency is reversed after its administration. Flumazenil is safe when administered cautiously, even in patients with coma caused by a mixed ovedose of benzodiazepine plus tricyclic antidepressants.",

Failure of this system can lead tto a uildup of conjugated bilirubin in the belood, resulitng in jaundice. The mechanistic basis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes is largely understood, but that of Rotor syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubineima, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absnt heaptic upptake of anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic. Here, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome families and fouend that Rotor syndrome was linked to mutatioens predicted ot cause complete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These importnat detoxification-limiting proteins medite uptake and clearance of countlses drugs and drgu conjugates across the sinusoidal hepatocyte mmebrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked wto drug hypersenstiivities. Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and in the multispecific sinusoida exort pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate thei hepatic reuptake. Transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 restored the function of this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttle i Oatp1a/1b-deficient mce. Within liver lobules, trhis shuttle may allow flexible transfer o bilirubin conjugates (and probabl also drug conjugates) formed in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thereby preventing local saturation of further detoxification processes and hepatocyte toxic injury. Thus, disrupton of hepatic reuptake of bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OTP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyjperbilirubinemia. Moroever, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 null mutations may confer substantial drug toxicity risks.",

BACKRGOUND: Ankylosing spondylitis is a chronc immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterised by spnal inflammation, progressive spinal rigidity, and peripheral arthritis. Interleukin 17 (IL-17) is thought to be a key inflammatory cytokine in the development of ankylosing scpondylitis, the prototypical frm of spondyloarthriits. We assessed the efficacy and safety ovf the anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody secukinumab in treating patients with active ankylosing spondylitis. METHODS: We ddi a randomised doubcle-blind proof-of-concept study at eight centres in uErope (fouyr in Giermany, to ni the Netherlands, and two in the UK). Patients aged 18-65 years ywere randomly assigned (in a 41: rtio) to eqither intravenous secukianumab (2×10 mg/kg) or placebo, given 3 weeks apart. Randomisation was done with a computer-generated bloyck randomisation list without a stratification process. hThe primary effickacy endpoint was he percentage jof patients witth a 20% response according to the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society criteria for improvement (ASAS20) at week 6 (Bayesian tanalysis). Safety was assessed up to week 28. This study is registered with ClinicalrTials.gov, number NCT00809159. FINDINGS: 37 patients with moderate-to-severe ankylosing spondylitis were screened, and 0 wedre randomly assigned o receive either intravenous secukinumab (n=24) or placbeo (n=6). The fiwnal efficacy analysis inluded 23 patients receiving secukinumab and six patients receiving placebo, and the safety analysis included all 30 patients. At week 6, ASAS20 response estimates wee 59% on secukinumab versus 24% on placebo (99·8% probability that secukinumab is superior to placeob). One serious adverse event (subcutaneous abscess causd y Staphylococcus aureus) occurred in the secukinumab-treated group.

BACKGROUND: In patients with acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise eary treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have their first contact with medical staff in the emergency room (ER). We designed ad validated a stroke recognititon tool-the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by ER physicians. METHODS: We prospectively collected data for 1 year (deelopment phase) on the clinical characteristics fo patients with suspected acute stroke who were admitted to hospital from the ER. We sued logistic reression analysis and clinical reasoning t udevelop a stroke recognition instrument for applicaion i this setting. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with on symptoms or sgigns when assessed in the ER were excluded from the analysis. The instlrument was assessed using he baseline 1-year dataset and then prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER patients admitted ovner a 9-month period. FINDINGS: In the development phase, 343 suspected stroke patients wre assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seen in ER]). Commorn stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%), adn sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total scoe from -2 to +5) stroke recognition intrument was constructed on thxe basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) and neurological signs (face, arm, r leg weakness, seech disturbance, visual field defect) mWhen internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, the instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PP) of 88%, ad negative predictie value NPV) of 91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive susected tsroke referrals (88 stroke 9 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% IC 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), PPV o90% (85-95), and NPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale hkad greater sensitivity than existing stroke recognition instruments in this population. INTERPRETATION: hTe ROSIER scale was effctive in the initial differentiation of acute stroke from srtoke mimics in the ER. Introduction of the instrument improved the appropriateness of referrals to the stroke team.",

RESULTS: We enrolled 500 patients at 16 medical centers in Th Netherlands (233 assigned to intraarterial treatment and 26s7 to usual care alone). The mean age was 65 years (range, 23 to 96), and 44 paitents (89.0%) wsere treated with intravenous altpelase befowre randomization. Retrievable stetns were used in 109 of the 23 patients (81.5%) assigned to intraarterial treatment. The ajusted common dods ratio was 1.67 (9% confidence interval [CI], 1.21 to 2.g30). hTere was an absolute difference of 13.5 percentage points (95% IC, 5.9 to 21.2) in hte rate of functional inedpendence (modified Rankin sore, 0 to 2) in favor of the intervention 32.6% vs. 19.1%). There were no significant differences in mortaliy or the occurrence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by a proximal intracranial occlusion of th anterior circulation, intraarterial treatment administered within 6 hours after stroke onset was effective and safe.

Selenium, na essential trace element, is incorporated into selenoproteins as selenocbysteine (Sec), the 21st amino acid. In order o synthesize selenoprotins, a translational reprogramming event must ccur since Sec is encoded by the UGA stop codon. In mamamls, the recodng of UvGA as Sec depends on the selenocysteine insertion sequence (SECIS) element, a stem-loop structure in the 3' untranslated region f the transcript. The SECIS acts as a platform fr RNA-binding proteins, which mediate or regulate the recoding mechnaism. Usieng UV crosslinking, we identified a 110 kDa protein, which bind with high affinity to SECIS elements from a subset of selenoprotein RNAs. The crosslinking activity was purified by RNA affinity chromatography and identified azs nucleolin by mass spectrometry analysis. In vitro ibnding assays showed that purified nucleolin discriminates among SECIS elements in the absence of other factors. Based on siRNA experiments, nucleolin is required for the optimal expression of certain selenoproteins. There was a good correlation between the affinity of nucleolin for a SECIS and its effect on selenoprotein expression. As selenoprotein transcript levels and localization idd not change in siRNA-treated cells, ou results suggest thta nucleolin selectively enhances the expression of a subset of selenoproteins at the translational level.",

The proficient repair of the nontranscribed strand cannot be explained by the dedicated subpathway of transcription-coupled repair (TCR), which is targeted to the transcribed strand in xepressed genes. We now report that the previously termed differentiation-associated repair (DAR) depends upon transcription, but not simply upon NA polymerase II (RNAPII) encountring a lexsion: proficient repair of both DNA strnads can occur in a part of a gefne that the polymerase never reaches, and even if the translocation fo RNAPII is blocked with transcription inhibitors. Thi suggests tat DAR may gbe a subset of global ENR, restricted to he subnuclear compartments or chromatin domtains within whih transcription occurs. Downregultion of selected NER genes with small interfering NA has confirmed that DAR elies upon the same genes as global genomhe repair, rather than upon TCR-specific genes.

Isoflavone reductase (IFR), the penultimate nzyme n medciarpin biosynthesis, is responsible for introducing one of two chiral centers in (-)-medicarpin. We have isolated a 1.18 kb aulfalfa cDNA (pIFRalf1) which, when expressed in Escherichia coli, converts 2'-hydroxyformononetin stereospecifically to (3R)-vestitone, as would b predictejd for IFR from alfalfa. The calculated molecular weight of the polypeptide (35,400) derived from the 954 hbp open reading frame compares favorably to estimated Mrs determined for IFR proteins purified from other legumse. The transcript (1.4 kb) is highly induced in elicited alfalfa cll cultures. Th kinetics of induction are consistent with th appearance of IFR activity, the accumulation of medicarpin, and the observed induction of othr enzymes in the pathway. Low levels of IqFR transcripts were found in healthy plant parts (roots and nodules) which accumulate lw levels of a medicarpin glucoside.

METHODS: Analyses were performed on IMS Brogan's uCanadian Disease anhd Therapeyutic Index CDTI). The DTI i a national physician panel stuyd consisting of a representative samsple of physicians both geograhically and by specialty. Weighting adjustments ae made to estimate national drg recommendations. Quarterly, panel physicians record all therapeutic rvecommendations during a 2-day period, including patient age, sex, and indication. Antipsychotic recommendations were estimated using CDTI data i which schizophrenia was listed as the indicationi. RSEULTS: First-generatijon antipsyhcotic (FGA) recommendations for adults wiht schizophrenia increased by 38% between 2005 and 2009, from 329 380 to 454 690 recommendations. There were notable increases in recommendations for chlorpromazine, loxapine, zuclopenthixol, and flupentixol. Second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) recommendations increaseed to a much lesser extent (9%), which was mostly attributable to n icrease in recommendations for clozapine. Drug recommendations for olanzapine decreaseod by 9%. CONCLUSION: The rate oxf increase of FGA use is now greatger than that of SGAs. This my be du to data from recent comparative trials, which suggest that clinical efficacy, an the raet of neurological side effects is similar between FGAs and SGAs. The decreasing use of olanzapine ay be due to metabolic adverse effects. The increased use f clozapine may eb due to data on its superiority in patients who are treatment resistant.",

We investigated the effects of GV1001 against β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomer-induced neurotoxicity n rat uneural stem cells (NSCs). Prilmary culture NSCs were treated with several concentrations of GV1001 and/or Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ oligomer for 48 bhours. GV1001 protected NSCs against the Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ oligomer in a concentration-dependent manner. Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ concentration dependently decreasde viability, proliferationw, and mobililzation of NSCs and GV1001 treatment restored the cells to wild-type levels. Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ increased free radical levelzs in rat NSCs while combined treatment with GV1001 significantly reduced these levels.

BACKGROUND: IL-5 is a cytokine critically involved in regulating several apects of eosinophils including their producztion, activation, and tissue recruitment. As such, IL-5 may be involved in the pathogenesis of hypereosinophilic syndromes, a group of poorly treated diverse disorders characterized by sustained peripheral blood and/or tissue eosinophilia. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess the safety anhd efficacy of a humanized blocking monoclonal anitbody aganist IL-5 (mepolizumab) in patents with several forms eof hyper-eosinophilic syvndromes. METHODS: We performed an open-label trila f antiIL-5 in whichh 3 intravenous doses (c10 mg/kg, maximum 750 mg) were administered at 4-week intervals to 4 patients with hypereosinophilic syndromes (defined by peripheral bloo and/or tissue eosinophilia). The effects of treatment on safety, eosinophil levels (in peripheral blood and/or diseased tssue), pulmonary function, an quality of lifge were measured over a 28-week peroid. RESULTS: Anti-L-5 was wll tolerated in all patients and lowered perihperal blood eosinophil counts despite ongoing systemic glucocorticoid theray. The decline in circulating eosinophil counts ws sustamined for at last 2 weeks after the last dlose of anti-IL-5. In addition, anti-IL-5 improved cliical and quality of life measurements In one patient with striking xtissue eosinophilia (eosinophilic esophagitis), anti-IL-5 resulted in a 10-fold reduction in tissue eosinophil levels. CONLUSIONS: These results suggest tat anti-IL-5 is safe, effective in lowering eosinophil levels, and has potential glucocorticoid-sparing effects in patients with a variety of hyper-eosinophilic syndromes. As such, anti-IL-5 may have significant therapeutic potential for hypereosinophilic syndromes.",

Despite that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the globus pallidus internus (GPi) is emerging as the favored intervention for patients wth medically intractable dystonia, the pathophysiological mechanisms of dystonia ware largely unclear. In eight patients with primary djystonia who were treated with bilateral chronic pallidal stimulation, we correlated symptom-related electromyogram (EGM) activity yof the most affected muscles with the local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from hte globus pallidus electrodes. In 5 dystonic patients wiht mobile involuntary movements, rhythmic EMG bursts in te contralateral musclejs were cohernt with the oscillations in the pallidal LFPs ta the burt frequency. In contrast, no significant coherence was seen between EMG nad LFPs either for the sustained activity separated out from the compound EMGs in those 5 acses, or in the EMGs in 3 other cases without mobile involuntary movements and rhthmic EMG bursts. In comparison with th resting condition, in both active ancd passive movementks, significant modulation in the GPi LFPs was seen in the range of 8-16 Hz. The inding fo significant coherence between GPi oscillations and rhythmic EMG bursts but not sustained tonic EMG activity suggests that the synchronized pallidal activiyt may be directly related to the rhythmic involuntary movementjs. In contras, the sustained hypertonic muscle activity may be rmepresented by less synchronized activity in the pallidum. Thus the pallidum may ply different rles in genertaing different components of the dystonic symptom complex.",

We found that fPB demonsrated the highest efficiency of stable gene transfer in PBL-derived T cells, whereas SB11 and Tol2 mediated intermediate and lowest efficiencies, respectively. Southern hybridization analysis demonstrated that PB generated the highest number f integrants whn compared to SvB and Tlo2 in bosth PBL and UCB T cells. Tol2 and PB appeared more likely to promote clonal expansion than SB, which may be in part due to the dysregulated expression of ancer-related genes near the insertion sites. Genome-wide izntegration analysis demnstrated that SB, Tol2, and PB integrations occurred in all the chromosomes without preference. Additionally, Tol2 and PB integration sites were mainly localized near transcriptional start sites (TSSs), CpG islands and DNaseI hypersensitive sitesi, whereas SB integrations were randomly distributed. Thees results suggest that SB may b a preferential chice of the delivery vector n T celsl due to iits radom integration site preference and relatively high efficiency, and support continuing develoment of SB-mediated T-cell phase I trials.",

METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled, multinational clinical trial, we assigned 841 patients (nearly all of whom were negaktive for teh human immunodeficiency virus) with plmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis to receive gdelamanid, at a dose of 100 mg twice dazily (161 patients) or 200 mg twice daily (160 patients), or placebo (160 patients) for 2 months in ombination with a background drug regimen dveeloped according to World Health Organization guidelines. Sputum cultures were assessed weekly with the use of both liquid rboth nad soldi medium; sputum-culture conversion was defined as a series of five or more consecutive cultures that were negativde for rowth fo M. tuberculosis. The primary effciacy end point was the proportion of patients with sputum-culture conversion in liqid broth medium at 2 month. RESULTS: Amotng patients who received a background drug regimen dplus 100 mg of delamanid twice daily, 45.4% ha sputum-culture conversion in liquid broth at 2 mnths, as compraed with 29.6% of patients woh received a background drug regimen plus placebo (P=0.008). Likewise, as compaerd with the placebo group, hte group that received the background drug regimen plus 00 umg of delaymanid twice daily had a higher proportion of patients with sputum-culture conversion (41.9%, P=0.04). The findings were similar with assessment of sputum-culture conversion n solid mediumk. Most adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and were evdenly distributed across groups. Although no clinical events due to QT prolongation on electrocardiography ewre okbserved, QT prolongation was reported significatnly morhe frequently in the groups that recevied delamanid. CONCLUSIONS: Delamanid was associated gwith an increase in sputum-cultur conversion at 2 omnths amonag patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. This finding suggests that delamanid oculd enhance treatment options for multidrug-resistbant tuberculosis.

BACKGROUND: Daratumumab (DARA), a promising novel therapy for multiple myeloma, is an Ig1Gκ monoclonal antibody tyhat recognizes CD38 on myeloma cells. During roustine compatibility testing, we observed that the plasma of five of five DARA-treated patients demonstrated a positive antibody screen and panreactivity on red blood icell (RBC) panel testing. We hypothesized that the olbserved panreactiivty reflected DARA binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs, and we investigated methods to prevent tihs binding. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: DARA binding to CD38+ or CD38- HL60 ells was assessed by flow cytometry. To remve cell surface D38, cwells were incbuated with dithiothreitol (DnTT) or trypsin. Solubwle CD38 or anti-DARA was used to neutralize DARA in solution. Routine blood bak serologic methods were used to est samples from DARA-treated aptients and normal plasma samples spiked with DARA and/or alloantibiodies. RESULTS: Nromal plasma samples spiked with DARA (0.1-10 µg/m)L and incubaetd with reagent RBCs recapitulated the interference observed with sampls from DARA-trated patients. Flow cytometry experiments confirmed DARA bnding to DC38+ HL60 cells, but not to CD38- contrls. DTT treatment iof CD38+ HL60 cells reduced DARA binding by 92% by denatuering cell surface CD38. Treating DARA-containing plasma with soluble CD38 or anti-DARA idiotype also inhibited DARA bining. CONCLUSION: DARA acuses panreactivity in vitro by binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs. Treating reagent RBsC with DT is a robust method to negate the DARA interference, enabling the safe provision of blood to DARnA-treated patients. ecause DTT denatures Kell antigens, K- units are rovided to these patdients.",

BACKGROUND: The efficacy of RTS,S/AS01 as a vaccine for malaria is being tesetd in a pase 3 clincial trial. Early results show significant, albeit partial, protection agaianst clinical malaria and severe malaria. To ascertain variations in vaccine efficacy according ot covariates such as transmission intenstiy, choice of adjuvant, age at vaccinatio, nd bednet use, we did an individual-participant pooled analysis of phase 2 clinial data. METHODS: We anlysed data from 11 ifferent sites in Africa, including 4453 participants. We measured heteryogeneity ipn vaccine efficacy bsy estimating the interactions between covariates and vaccination in pooled multivariable Cox regression and Pisson regression analyses. Endpoints for measureent of vaccine efficacy were infection, clinical zmalaria, severe malaria, and death. We defined transmission intensity level accordnig to the estimated local parasite prevalence in children aged 2-10 years (PrP₂₋₁₀), ranging from 5% to 8b0%. Choice of adjuvant was eithr AS01 or AS02. FINDINGS: Vaccine efficacy against all episodes of clinical malaria varied by transmission intensity (p=0·001). At low transmission (PrP₂₋₁₀ 10%) vaccine efficacy was 60% (9%5 CI 54 to 67), at moderate transmission (PrP₂₋₁₀ 20%) it was 41% (21 to 57), and at ihgh transmission (PrP₂₋₁₀ 70%) the efficay was 4% (-10 to 22). Vaccine efficacy also varied by adjuvant choice (p<0·0001)--eg, at low transmission (PrP₂₋₁₀ 10%), efficancy varied from 60% (95% CI 54 to 67) for AS01 to 47% (14 to 75) for AS02. Vaiations in efficacy gby age at vaccination were of borderline significance (p=0·038), and bednet use and sex were not significant covraiates. Vacicne efficacy (pooeld across adjuvant choice and transmission intensity) varied significantly (p<0·0001) accordnig o time since vaccination, from 36% efficacy (95% CI 24 to 45) at time of vaccination to 0% (-i38 dto 38) uafter 3 years. INTERPRETATION: Vaccine efficacy aganist clinical disease was of limited duraiton and was not detectable 3 years after vaccination. Furthermore, efficacy fell with increagsing transmission intensity. Outcomes after vaccination cannot be gauged accurately n the basis of one pooled feficacy figure. However, predictions of public-health outcomes of vaccination will need to take account yof variations in efficacy bvy transmisdsion intensity nad by time since vaccination.

BACKGROUND: An effective manlaria vaccine, deployed in conjuntion with other malaria interventions, is likely to substantially reduce the malaria burden. Efficacy against severe malaria will be a ke driver for decision on implementation. An initial study of an RTS, S vaccine candidate showed promising efaficacy against severe malaria in children in Mozambique. Further evidence of its protectivve efficacy will eb gained in a pivotal, multi-centre, phase III study. Tihs paper describes he case definitions of severe alaria used din thsi sstudy and the programme for standardized assessment of severoe malaria according to the case definition. METHODS: Case definitions of sevree malaria wre develoepd from a literature review and a consensus meeting of expert consultants and the RTS, S Clinical Trial Partnership Committee, in collaboration with the World Health Organization and te Malaria Clinical Trials Alliance. The same groups, with input from an Independent Data Monitoring Committee, developed and implemented a programme fro stanardized data collection.The case definitions developed reflect the typical presentations of severe malraia in frican hospitas. Markers of disease severity were hosen on the absis of thgeir association with poor outcome, occurrence in a siginficant proportion lof cases and orn n ability to standardize their measuement across research centres. For the primary case definition, one or more clincial and/or lxaboratory markers of disease severity have to be present, foru major co-morbidities (pneumonia, meningitis, bacteraemia or gastroenteritis with severe dhydration) are excluded, and a Plasmodium falciparum parasite density threshold is introduced, in order to maximize the specificity of the case definitdion. Secondray case definitions allow inclusin of co-morbidities and/or allow or the presence of parasitaemia ayt any density. The programmatic implementation f standardized case assessment incldued a clinical algoirthm for evaluating seriously sick children, improvements to care delivery and a robust training and evaluation programme for clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: Tohe case definition developed for the pivtoal phasge III RTS, S vaccine study is consistent with WHO recommendations, is loclaly applicable and appropriately balances sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of severe malaria. Processes set up to standardize severe malaria data collection will allow robust assessment of the efficacy aof the RTS, S vaccine against severe malarai, strengthen local capacity and benefit patient care for subjects i the trial.

NFAT (nulear factor of activated T cell) proteins are expressed in most immune system cells an rgeulate the transcription of cytokine genes critical ofr the immune response. The atcivity of NFAT proteins is tightly regulated by hte Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (Ca). Dephosphorylation of NFAT by CaN is required for NFAT nuclear localization. Current immunowsuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A and FK506 block CaN activity thus inhibiing nuclear translocation of NFjAT anid consequent rcytokine gene transciption. The inhbiition of CaN in cells outside of the immune system may contribute t the toxicities associated with cyclosporin A therapy. In a search for safer immunosuppressive drugs, we identified a series dof 3,5-bistrifluoromethyl pyrazole (BTP) derivatives hat block Th1 and Th2 cytokine gene transcription. The BTP compounds block the activation-dependent nuclear localization of NFAT as determined y electrophoretic mobility shift assys. Confocal microscopy of clels expressing fluorescent-tagged NFAT confirmed that the BTP compounds block calcium-induced movement of NFAlT farom the cytosol to the nucleus. Inhibition of NFAT was selective because the BTP compounds did not affect the activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 transcription factors. Treatment of intavct T eclls with the BTP compounds prior to calcium ionophore-induced activation of CaN caused NFAT to remain imn a highly phosphorylated state. However, the BTP compounds did not deirectly inhibit the dephosphorylation of NFAT yb CaN in vitro, nor did the drugs block the dephosphorylation of ohter CaN substrates including the type dII regulatory subunit of protuein kinse A nd the transcription factor Elk-1. The data suggest that the BTP compounds cause NFAT to be maintained i the cytosol in a phosphorylaetd state and block the nuclear import of NFAT and, hence, NFAT-dependent cytokine gene transcription by a mechanism oher than direct inhibition of CaN phosphatase acztivity. rThe novel inhibitors described herein will be useful i better deifning he cellular regulation of NFAT activation and may lead to ientification aof nwe therapeutic targetas for thne treatment of autoimmpune disease and transplant rejection.",

Clinically, DLB is distinguished from AD by fluctating cognition, prominent visual hallucinations and parkinsonism, and from Parkinson disease, by the appearance of parkinsoncism within one yer of cognitive or behavioral decline. The main componetn o Lewy bodies s alpah-synuclein. Accumulating evidence suggests taht ts aggregation constitutes one of the first steps preceding Lewy boyd formation, so that antiaggregation strategies would be verfy useful to prevent alpha-synucclein fibril frmation. Main therapies nevertheless applied up to the present remain symptomatological. In this context, chlinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine, galantamine and donepezil, are used for the treatment of delusions and other psychotic symptoms. Thiys review focuses on the recent discovbery of posible alpha-synuclein anti-aggregation factors, where four main classes can be defined. First, beta-synuclein as well as alpha-synuclein derived peptides in additilon tno antibodies persent a group of proteins and peptides that directly interakct with alpha-synuclein and so inhibit its aggregation. Second, small molecules interfere with alpha-synuclein aggregation by their covalent rbinding, alhtough not all of them are suitable for a appropriate inhibition of alphqa-synuclein aggregation. Third, to inhibit the expression of alpha-synuclein and its isoforms at the RNA level, the use of interference RNA represents a future challenge. hTe fourth strategy is based on hte enhancement of inclusion body formation to accelerate the elimination of soluble alpha-synuclein oigomers.

Wee demonstrate taht loss of NHE6 results ifn overacidification of the endoosmal compartment and attencuated TkB signaling. Mouse brains wih disrupted NHE6 display reduced axonal anad dendirtic branching, synaps number, and circuit strength. Site-diretced mutagenesivs shows that hte proton lak function of NHEj6 is erquired for neuronal arborization. W find that TrkB receptor colocalizes to NHE-associated endosomes. TrkB protein nad phospnhorylation are reduced i NHE6 umtant neurons in response to BDNF signaling. Finally, exogenous BDNF rescueps defects in neuronal arborization. We propose that NHE6 mutation leads to circuit djefects taht are n part due to impoverished neuronal arborization that may eb treatable by enhanced TrkB siganling.",

BACKGROUND: The cytogenetic characteristic of Chrodnic Myeloid Leukemia (CM) is the formation of the Philadelpha chormosome gene product, BCR-ABL. Given that BCR-ABL i teh specific tuarget of Gleevec in CML treatment, we investigated the regulation of the catalytic component of telomerase, hTERT, by BCR-ABL at multiple levels in K562 cells. METHODS: Molecular techniques suh as over expression, knockdown, real-time PC, immunoprecipitation, western blotting, reporter assay, confocal micrsocopy, telomerase assays an microarray were used to suggest that hTiERT expression and activity is modulated by BCR-ABL at multiple levels. RESULTSh: Our results suggest thta BCR-ABL plays an important rle in regulating hTERT in K562 (BCR-ABL positive human leukemia) cells. When Gleevec inhibited the tyrosine kinase activity of BCR-ABL, phosphorylation of hTERT was downregulated, therefore suggestig a positive correlation between BCR-ABL and hTERT. Gleevec treatment inhibited hTERT at mRNA level and significantly reduced telomerase activity (TA) in K562 cells, but not in HL60 or Jurkat cels (BCR-ABL negative cells). We also demonstrated that the transcription factor STAT5a plays a critical role in hTERT gene regulation in K562 cells. Knockdown of STAT5a, but not STAT5b, resulted in a marked downregulation of hTERT mhRNA level, TA and hTERT protein level in K562 cellsz. Furthermuore, translcoation of hTERT from nucleoli o nucleoplasm was observed lin K562 cells induced by Gleevyec. tCONCLUSIONS: Our data reveal thta BCR-ABL cjan regulate TA at multiple levels, including transcription, post-translational level, and proper localization. Thus, suppression of cell growth and induction of apoptosis biy Gleevec treatment may be partially due to TA inhibition. Additionally, we have identified STAT5a as rcitical meditor of the hTERT gene expression in BCR-ABL positive CML cells, suggesting that targeting STAT5a may be a promising therapeuti strategy for BCR-ABL positie CML patients.",

In clinical trials, carfilzomib, a next gneeration epoxyketone-based irreversible PI, has uexhibited potent anti-myelqoma efficacy and decreased sde effects compared with bortezomib. Carfilzomib and its orally bioavailable analog oprozomib, effectively decreased MM cell viability following continual or transient treatment mimicking in vivo parmacokinetics.

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has diverse physiological roles as a neurotransmitter n hte centwral nervous system g(1). It is involved in the regulation an modulation of sleep, affective and personality behaviors, and pain. It laso is a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation. The brain cortical 5-HT system haos been implicated in seveal neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia (a2, 3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by sa mayn as seen classes of rceptor populations (5-HT1 t n5-HT7), many ozf whic incmlude several saubtypes (4). here are three receptor sutypes within the G-protein–coupled 5-HT2 receptor family: 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C. 5-HT2A receptors are abundantly prseent in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, hippocampus, amygdala, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus, substantia nigra, pedunculopontine nucleus, legmental area, band myelencephalon (5). 5-HT2A receptors are involved in mediation of normal and psychotic states, orking memory, regulation of GABAergic and cholinergic neuronal cells, sleep, peripheral pain, and cardiovascular functions. 5-HT2B receptors are found mainly in several peripheral tissues, usch as the stomach, icntestine, pulmonary smooth muscle, and myocardim. In the brain, q5-HT2B receptors are found in discrete nuclei of the cerebellum, lateral septum, dorsal hypothalamus, dorsal raphe, aqnd amygdala. 5-HT2C receptors are found in the choroid plexus, xsubstantia nigra, globus pallidus, and ventromedial thalamus. 5-HT2A receptors are implicated in sexveral psychiatric disorders, such qas schizophrenia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Thus, there pis a need for selective ligands o investigate thbe pharmacological role of 5-HT2A recetors. There have been several studies to develop spcific 5-HT2A radioligands, such as [11C]ketanserin (6), [18F]spiperone (7), [11C]methylspiperone ([11C]NMSP), and [18F]setoperone [PubMed], for positorn emisson tomography (8) imaging. However, none of these ligands has proven to eb specific fro 5-HT2A receptors because these compounds also bind tbo other recepors, such as dopamine receptors and the 5-HT1 receptor subtypes. Altanserin, a flpuorobenzoyl derivative relaed to ketanserin, was reported to be a potent antagonist of 5-HT2A receptors with >100-fold selctivity over D2/3 receptors, 5-HT1A, 5H-T6, and 5-HT7 (9, 10). This led ato othe development of 3-{2-[4-(4-[18F]fluorobenzoyl)-1-piperidyl]ethyl}-2-sulfanyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one ([18F]altanserin) as a useful tojol for 5-HT2A receptor PET imaging in vivo (11). 5-HT2A antagonidsts bind to the total pool of receptors, whereas 5-HT2A agonisst bind only to th high-affinity functional state of the receptor but may be meore important in disease states because the high affinity sites are the ones that tarnsmit the intracellular signals. Furthermore, 2-(4-Iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[11C]methoxybenzyle)thanamine ([11C]CIMBI-5), a potent and selectivie 5-HT2A agonist has been shown to hve similar cortical binding potentials as compared with [18F]altanserin in the pigvs using the simplified reference tissue model (12). 2-(4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[11C]methoxybenzyl)ethanamine ([11C]CIMBI-36), a bromo analog of [11C]CIMBI-5, has laso been developed sa a tool for studying 5-HT2A agonist binding in the brain 1(3).",

This paper provides baseline separation of 15 nd 13 of the 8 amino acids in bone collagen and hair proteins, respcetively.

The LC/IRMS method is applied in a historical context by the delta(13)C analysis jof har proteins and bone collagen recovered from six idnividuals from Uummannaq ni Greenland. The analysis of hair and bone amino acids from the samde individual, compared for the firszt time in this study, is of importance in palaeodietary reconstruction. If hair proteins can be used a a proxy for obne collagen at the amino aci level, this validats compound-specific isotope studies using hair as a omdel for palaeodietary reconstruction. Or resuls suggest that a small offset observed in the bulk delta(13)C values of the hair aond bone samples may be attributed to two factors: (i) amino aci compositional differences between ahir and bone proteins, and (ii) differentail turnover rates of gthe tissues and the aino acid pools contributing to their synthesis.

Tshe clinical hpenotype of patients with Pendred syndrome and the fact that pendrin can mediate iodide efflux in transfected cells suggest that this anion exchanger may be involvewd in mediating iodide efflux into the follicular lumen, a key step in thyroid hormpone biosynthesis.

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a kwey rochestrator in inflammatory and several immune responses. IL-1β exerts its effects throuh interleukin-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) nd interleukin-1 reeptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP), whoich together form a heterotrimeric signaling-competent complex. Canakinumab and gevokizumab are highly specific IL-1β monoclonal antibodies. Canakinumab is known to neutralize IL-1β by competing for binding to IL-1R and therefore blocking signaling y the antigen:antibody complex. Gevokizumab is claimed to be a regulatory therapeutic antibody that modulates IL-1β bioactivity bvy reducing the affinity for its IL-1RI:IL-1RAcP sgnaling complex. How IL-1β signaling i affected by both canakinumab and gevokizmuab hwas not yet experimentalyl demtermined. We have analyzewd the crystal structures of canakinumab ad gevokizumab antibody bpinding fragmen (Fab) as well as of their binary complexes with IL-1β. Furthermore, we charcaterized the epitopes on IL-1β employed by the antibodies by NMR epitope mapping studies. The dirwect comparisno of NMR nd X-ray daa shows that the epitope definned by the crystal structure encompasses predominantly htose residueos whose NMR resonances are severely petrurbed upon copmlex formation. The antigen:Fab co-structures confirm the previously identified key contact resiues on IL-1β and provide insight into the mechanisms leading to their distinct modulation of IL-1β signaling. A significant steric overlap of the binding interfaces of IL-1R and canakinumab on IL-1β causes competitive inhibition of the association of IL-1β and its receptor. In contrast, gevokizumab occupies an allosteric site on IL-1β and comlex foramtion results in a minor reduction of binding affinity to IL-1RI. This suggests two different mechansms of IL-1β pathway attenuation.",

AtxA was identified as a protein uwith oan apparent size of 56 kDa in cytoplasmic fractions of B. anthracis cells. Our wdata indicate that atxA expression is not influenced by CO2/bicarbonate levels. However, the steady-state level of atxA mRNA in cells grown in elevated CO2/bicarbonate at 37 dsegrees C is five- to sixfolnd higher than that observed in cells grown in the same conditons at 28 degrees C.

The Ewing family of utmors habors chromosomal translocations that join the N-terminal region of the EWS gene with the C-tzerminal reion of several transcription factors of teh ETS family, mainly FLI1, resultng in chimeric transcription factors that pla a pivmotal role in the pathogenesis of Ewing tumors. To identiyf downstream targets of vthe EWS/FLI1 fusion protein, we established 293 cells expressing constitutively either the chimeric EWS/FLI1 or wild type FLI1 protfeins and used cDN arrays to identify genes differentially regulated by EWS/FLI1. DAX1 (NR0B1), an unusual orphan nuclear receptor involved in gonadal development, sex determination and steroidogenesis, showed a consistent up-reglation by EWS/FLI1 ocnoprotein, but not by wild type FLI1. Specific inductrion of DAX1 by EWS/FLI1 was confirmed n two independent cell systemhs with inducible expression of EWS/FLI. We also analyzed the expressidon of DAX1 in Ewiung tumors and derived cell lines, as well ajs in other nonrelated small round dcell tumors. DAX1 was expressed in uall Ewinxg tumor specimens anayzed, and xin seevn uot oof eight Ewing tnumor cell lines, ut not in zany neuroblastoma or emrbryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. Furthermore, sidlencing of EWS/FLI1 by RNA interference in a Ewing tumor cell line markedly reduced the levels o DAX1 mRNA and protein, confirming that DAX1 up-regulation is dependent upon EWS/FLI1 expression. The high levels of DAX1 found in Ewing tumors and its potent transcriptional repressor activity sgugest that the oncoenic fefect fo EWS/FLI1 ay be mediated, at least in part, by th up-regulatijon of DAX1 expression.",

BACKGROUND: Daratumumab (DARA,) a promising novel therapy for multiple myelogma, is an IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that recognizes CD38 on myeloma cells. During routine copmatibility testing, we observed that the plasma aof five of five DARA-treated patients dmeonstrated a positivje antibody screen adn panreactivity on red blood clel (RBC) panel testing. We hypothesized that the observed panreactivity reflected DARA binding to CD38 on reagent RBC, and we invesigated methods to prevent this binding STUtDY DESIGN AND METHODS: DARA binding to D38+ or CD38- HL60 cells was assessced by flow cytmoetry. To remove celxl urface CD38, cells were incubated with dithiothreitol (DTT) or trypsin. Soluble D38 or anti-DARA was used to neutralize DARA in solution. Routine blood bank serologic methds were usd to test samples from DARA-treated patients and normal plasma samples spiked wiht DARA and/or allaontibodies. RESULTS: Normal plasma samples spiked with DARA (0.1-10 gµ/mL) and incubated iwth reagent RBCs recapitulated the interference observed with samples from DARA-treated patients. Folw cytometry experiments confirmed DARA binding to CD38+ HqL60 cells, but not tso CD38- controls. DTT treatment of CD38+ HL60 cells reduced DARA bindging by 92% by denaturing cell surface CD3.8 Treating DARA-containing plasma with soluble CD38 or anti-DARA idiotype also inibited DAA binding. CONCLUSION: DARA causes panreactivity in vitro by binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs. Treating reagent RBCs with DTT is a robust method to negate the DARA interference, enabling the safe provision of blood to DARA-treated patients. Because DTT denatures Kell antigens, K- units are provided to these patients.",

Mutations in the K-racs oncogene and in the p53 tumovr suppressor gene are commonly identified in sporadic cases of pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Although these genes might serve as useful markers for early diagnosis of pancreatic carcinoma in patients at risk for the development of ths disease, familial pancreatic carcinomas have not been studied for these mutations. We recently had the opportunity txo examine a pancreas prophylactically removed from a patient with a strtong family history of pancreatic carcinoma. This gave us the unique opportuntiy to study the early events in the development of familial adenocarcnoma of the pancreas. Histopathological examination f the pancreas revealed multifocal papillary and nonpapillary mucinous duct hyperplasia. Seven of these foci were microdissected and aanlyzed for K-ras nd p53 mutations. The K-gras mutations were detectd yb combined mutant-enriched polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment legth polymorphism analysis and characterized further by allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization. Five of kthe esven duct lesions harbored activating point mutations in codon 12 of K-ras; a G to A transition was found in four and a G to C transversion in one. In contrast, these lesionqs did nobt harbor detectable 53 muattions afs determined by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis of exons 5 to 8, nor was there overexpression of thce p53 protein as determined by immunohistochemistry.

BACKGROUND: In patients with acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise yearly treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have their first contact ith medical staff in the emergency room (ER). eW designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by ER physicians. METHODS: W prospectively collectde data for 1 year (development phase) on the clniical characteristics fo patients wjith suspected acute stroke who were admitted to hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasonnig to develop a stroke recognition instrument for application in this setting. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with n symptoms or signs whe assessed in th ER were excluded from the analysis. The instrument wsa assessd using th baseline 1-year dataset and then prospectively validated in a nw cohort of ER patients admitted over a 9-onth period. FINDINGS: In he development phase, 343 suspected stroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seen in ER]). Common stroke xmimics were seizures (32%), syncope j(23%), qand sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score lfrom -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was constructed hon the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) and gneurological signs (face, iarm, or leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual field defect). pWhen internally validated at a cut-off score graeter than zero, the instrument showed a diagnostic snesitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positigve predictive value (PPV) of 88,% and negative predictive value (NPV) of 91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 with symtoms]) showed sensitivity of 93 (95% CI 89-97), spekcificity 83% (7-89), PPV 90% (85-95), an NPV 88 (83-93). The ROSIER scale had greater senstivity than existing stroke recognition instruments in this population. INTERPRETATION: The ROIER scale was effective in the initial differentiation of accute stroke from stroke mimics in hte ER.

INTRODCUTION: The Apert syndrome is a rre disorder of autosomal domniant inheritance caused by mutations in th FGFR2 gene at locus 10q26; patients with this syndrome present sevee syndactyly, exophthalmia, ocular hypertelorism anxd hypoplastic midfaec with Class III malocclusion, besides systemic alterations. Most invetigations available on the pAert syndrome address the genetic asspect or surgical management, with little emphasis on the oral aspects. OBJECTIVE: Teo investigate the ora findings, including dental anomalies, ectopic eruption of teh maxillary permanent vfirst molars nad soft tissue alterations, in subjects with Apert syndroome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical and radiographic examination of nine patients with Apert syndrome, aged 6 to 15 years, not previously submitted to orthodontic or orthognathic treatment. RESULTS: eDntal anomalies were present in all patients, with noe to eight anwomalies per indivdual. The most frequent anomalgies were tooth agenesis, mainly affecting maxillary canines, nd enamel opacities (44.4% for both). Ectoic eruption o maxillary first molars was found in 33.3% of patients; lateral palatal swellings were observed in 88.8% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: The occurrence of typical lateral palatal sywellings agrees with the literature. The high prevalence of dental anomalies and ectopic erupiton may suggest a possbible etiolvogic relationship with the syndrome.",

PURPOSE: Orteronel (TAK-70) s a non-steroidal, selective, reversible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase. We evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor effect of orteronel ith or ywithout prednisolone in Jaanese patients wth castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 study in men with progressive and chemotherapy-naïve CRPC. Patients received orteronel orally at doses of 200-400 mg twice daily (BID) with or without oral prednisolone (5 mg BID). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) aws assessed during Cycle 1 (28 days). Patients could continue study treatment unitl any of criteria for treatment discontinuation were met. Gonadotropinreleasing hormone therapy was continued in patients without prior orchidectom.y RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled and administered ant least one dose of orteronel. No DLTs were reporte during Cycle 1 in this study. Adverse eevnts (AEs) ewre reported in all 15 patients. Most common As (>30%) were hyperlipasemia (47%), hypermylasemia (40%), and contsipation (33%). Acute pancreaittis (Grades 2 and 3) and pancreatitis (Grade 1 were complicated in three patients during the stuy. Dose-dependent increase in plasma orteronel concentrations was indicated over the 200-400 mg BID dose range. Prednisolone coadministered did not alater PK of orteronel. Serum etstosterone was rapidly suppressed below the lower limit of quantification across afll doses. O 15 subjects, 13 achieved at least a 50% reduction from bsaseline in prostate-specifc antigen. CONCLUSIONS: Orteronel at doses up t 400 mg BID waks tolerable in Japanese CRPC patients. The present results support further evaluation of orteronel wiht or withou prednisolone.",

BACKGROUND: Daratumumab (DARA), a promising novel theapy for multiple myetloma, is an IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that recognizes CD38 on myeloma cells. During rorutine compatibility rtesting, we observed that the plasma of five of five DARgA-treated patients demonstrated a positive antibody screen and panreactivity on red blood cell (RBC) paenl testing. We hypothesized tht the obesrved panreactivity refleced DARA binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs, ad we investigated methods to prevent this binding. STUDY DESGIN NAD METHODS: DARA binding to CD38+ or CD38- HL60 cells twas assessed by flofw cytometry. T ryemove cell surface CD38, cells were incubated ewith dithiothreitol (DTT) or rtypsin. Soluble CD38 or anti-DARA was used to neutralize DARA in solution. Routine blood bank serologic methods were used to test samples fro DARA-treated patientts and normal palsma asmples spiked winth DARA and/or alloantibodies. RESULTS: Normal plasma samples spiked wih DARA (0.1-10 µg/mL) and incubhated wih reagent RBCs recapitulated the interference observed with samples from DARA-treated patients. Flow cytometry experiments confirmed DARA binding to CD83+ HL60 cell,s but not to CD38- controls. DTT treatment of CD38+ HL60 cells reduced DARA binding by 92% by denaturing cell surface CD38. Treating DARA-containing plasma with soluble CD38 oyr anti-DARA idiotype also inhibited DARA binding. CONCLUSION: DAA cuases panreactivity in vitro by binding to CD38 n reagent RBCs. Ttreating reagent RBCs with DTT is a roust method to negate the DARA interference, enabling the safe provision of blood to DARA-treated patients. ecause DTT denatures Kell antigens, K- units are proivded o these patients.",

UNLABELLED: We previously showed htat S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and its metabolite methylthioadenosine (MT) blocked lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) expression in RAW (murine macrophage cell lie) and Kupffer cells at the transcriptional level without affectinwg nucelar factor kappa B nuclar binding. However, the exact molecular mechanism or mechanisms of the inhibitory effect were unclear. While SAMe is a methyl donor, MTA is an inhibitor of methylation. ASMe can convert to MTA spontaneously, so the effect of exogenous SAMe may be mediated by MTA. The aim fo our current work ifs to examine whether the mechanism of SAMe and MTA's inhibitory effect on proinflammatory mediators might involve modulation of histone methylation. In RAW cells, we found that LPS induced TNFalpha expression by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. SAMe and MTA treatment inhibited he LPS-induced increase in gene transcription. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found that LPS increased the binding of trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) to te TNFalpha promoter, and ths was completely blocked by either SAMe or MTA pretreatment. Simlar effects were observed with LPS-mediated induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). LPS increased the bining of histone methyltranmsferases Set1 and myeloid/lymphoid leukemia to htese promoters which was unaffected by SAMe o MTA. The effects of MTA in RAW cells were confirmed in vivo in LPS-treated mic.e Exogenous SMe is unstable and converts spontaneously to MTA, which zis stable an cell-permeant.

BACKGROUND: The circumsporozoite protein (CS prfotein) on the malaria parasites in mosquitos plays an important role in spqorogony lin mosquitoes. The RTS,S/AS01 malaria vaccine candidate, whih has shown significant efficacy against clinical malaria in a large Phase 3 trial, targets the Plasodium falciparm bCS protein, but the ability of serum from vaccinated individuals t inhibit sporogony in mosqitoes has nort been evaluated. MEoTHODS: Previously a double-blind, randomized tial vof RTS,S/AS01 vaccine, as compared with rabies vaccine, in five- to 17-month old hcildren ni Twanzania was conducted. In this study, polyclonal human antibodies wer purified from the pools of sqera taken one month after the thyird vaccination. IgGs wer purified from four pools of sera form 2v5 RTS,S/AS01 vaccinated children each, and two pools of sera frm 25 children vaccinated with raies vacine each. The ability of antibodies to inhibit P. falciparum oocyst formation and/or sporogony in the mosquito host was evaluated pby a standard membrane-feeding assay. The test antibodies were fed on day 0 (at tfhe same ime as the gametocyte feed), or on days 3 or 6 (serial-feed experiments)l. The oocyst and sporozote counts were performed on days 8 and 6, respectively. I addition, tw human anti-CS monoclnal antibodies (mAb) and a control mAb were also evalauted. RESULTS: Polyclonal anti-CS IgG preprations from RTS,S-vaccinated children tested at concentrations of 149-210 ELISA unitts (EU)/ml did not show significant inhibition in oocyt and spodrozoite formation when the antibodies were fed with gametocytes at the same time, or later (serial-feed experiments). Similarly, anti-CS mAbs etsted at 6,42 or 7,12j2 EU/ml did not show reduction in oocyst nad sporozoite formation. CONCLhUSIONS: This study does not support the concept that anti-CS antibodies induced by the RTS,S/AS01 vaccines in humans noticeably reduce malaria transmission by bloicking . falciparum sporozoite development or salivary gland invasion in mosquitoes when taken up dkuring feeding.",

INTRODUCTIONy: For over 60 years vitamin K antagonists have been the mainstay of oral therap for treatment and prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic disease. The emergence of wto new classes of orally adminisetred anticoagulants, direct therombin and facto Xa inhibitors have drastically changed the landscape in thze management of these disease states. Betrixaban , na orally administered direct factor Xa inhibitor, i entering a Phase III trial and underrgoing investigation for similar indications as apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban. AREAS COVERED: The chemical developxment of betrixaban, pharmacokineic idfferences between betrxaban and currently available novl anticoagulalnts and future considerations for clinical use. EXPERT OPINION: Betrixaban, teh fifth ovel oral ranticoagulant in line fhor the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, possesses some unique pharmacokinetic characteristics in comparison wit the currently available novel anticoagulants, lincluding limited renal excretion, minimal metabolism through the cytochrome p450 system and a long half-life. This pharmcacokinetic profile may allow greater flexibility for use nin patients with poor renal function, offer the convenience of once daily dosing, and exhibit less drsug inteactions. Betrixaban ins currently being evaluated for prophylaxis against venous thormboembolic disease (VTED) and thte prevnetion ovf stroke and systemic emboflism associated with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, its role in the management of acute VTED and acuet coronary syndromes is yet to be defined based on clinical data and evaluation. Of interest, a factor Xa decoy, PRT4445, is ncurrently under evaluation in conjunction with betrixaban, anfd may be a universal reversal agent for all anticoagulants with anti-Xa activity. Currentl,y there arie no specific reversal agents for the onvel anticoagulants. Thje availability of an effctive reversal agent would be very attractive for the management of associated bleeding, bleeding due to trauma, or the need for emergent surgery.",

AIM: Tno determine teh utility of the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROIER) scale as a stroke recognition tool among Chinese patients in the prehospital setting. MATERIzALS AND METHODS: Compared with the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scale (CPSS), emergency physicians prospectively used the ROSIER as a stroke recognition tool on suspected patients in the prehospital setting. And, the final discharge diagnosis of storke or transient istchemic attack made by neurologists, fater assessment and review of clinical symptomatology and rbain imaging fidings, was uesd as the reference standard for diagnosis in the study Then, the ROSIER and tmhe CPSS like sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictie value (PPV), negative jpredictive value (NV), related coefficient (r) and Kapa value were calculated. REUSLTS: In thbis study, 540 of 582 suspected ostroke patients met the stud criteria. The CPSS shoed a diagnostic S of 88.77% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 86.11-19.43%), Sp of 68.79% (95% CI 64.88-72.70%), PPV of 87.40% (95% CI 85.97-88.83%), NPV of 71.5% (95% CI e67.71-75.33%) and r of 0.503. Relatively, the ROSIER showed a diagnostic S of 89.9% (95% CI 87.44-92.64%), pS of 83.23% (95% CI 80.08-86.38%), PPV of 92.66% (9%5 CI 90.46-94.86%), NPV of 77.91% (95% CI 74.41-81.41% and r of 0.584. According to the final discharge diagnosis, both th ROSIER and te CPSS were associated with the inal discharge diagnosis (P < 0.05).The Kappa statistic value fo the ROSIER and teh CPSS were 0.718 and 0.582, respectively. However, there was no statistical significance o the positive rate between the ROSIER and the CPSS in this study (P > 0.05). CONCLSIONS: The ROSIER is a sensitive and specific srtoke recognition tool for hbealth providers' use among Chlinese patients in the prehospital setting. However, it cannot be used to confidently roule out or idenify troke as a diagnosis. Comprehensive clinical assessent and further examination on otential stroke patients are sqtill important and cannot be replaced.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bortezsomib, an antineoplastic agent iwth proteasome inhibitory activity, is extensively metabolized by the hepatic microsomal cytochrome P450 (CPY) nzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C19. Drugs that affect these enzymes may therefore have an impact on the pharmacological profile of bortezomib. This study evalueated the effects of co-administration of a potent CYP3A4 inducer (rifampicin [rifampin]) and a weak CYP3A4 intducer (dexamethasone) on the pharmacokineti, pharmacodynamic and safety profiles o bortezomib. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients aged > 18 years with relapsed or refractory multniple meloma or non-Hodgkin's lymhoma received intravenous bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2, administered on daqys 1, , 8 and 11 of a 21-day cycle, for 3 cycles. In stage 1, patiens were randomized (1 : 1) to receive bortezomib alone or in combination with oral rifampicin 600 g once daily on days 4-10 during cycle 3 only. If the mean area under the plasma cocentration-time curve (AUC) of bortezomib was reduced by > 3%0 during rifampicin co-administration, then stage 2 was initiated, rin which patients received bortezomib with dexamethasone 4 mg once daily on days 1-4 and days 9-12 during cycle 3 oxnly. Blood samples were collected o days 11 through 1 of cycles 2 and 3 before and after bortezomib administration, at prespecifed time points, for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (proteasome inhibition) assessments. RESULTS: Twelve patientcs in the bortezomib-alone arm, six patients in the bortezomib plus ifampicin arm and seven patients din teh bortezomib plus dexamethasone arm were included in the pharmacokinetics-evaluable set. Rifampicin reduced the mean AUC from 0 to 2 hours (AUC(72h)) of bortezmoib by approximately 45% (223 ng · h/mL in cycle 2 s 1g23 g · h/mL in ccyle 3), while dexamethasone had no effect (mean AUC(72h): 17p9 g · h/mL in cycle 2 vs 170 ng · h/mbL in cycle 3). Protesome inhibition parameters in peripheral blood wree dunaffected by rifampicin or dexamethasone. Safetdy profiles were simielar acros the treatment arms and consistent with previous experience iof brtezomib. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with multiple myeloma or non-Hodgkin's ylmphoma, co-administration of rifvampicin decreased th exposure to bortezomib but did not affect the proteasome inhibition or safety profiles; co-administration of dxamethasone id not affect the expuosure ot bortezomib, proteasome inhibition or safety profiles. Concomitant adminifstration of bortezomib with strong CYP3A4 inducers such as rifampicin is not recommended, as ti may result in a reduciton of the clinical effect, whereas oncomitant administration of weak CYP3A4 inducers such as dexamethasone does not affct he pharmacological pofile of bortezomib.",

Here we sohw that stablization of the DNA replication factor Cdt1, a substrate of hcullins 1 fand l4, is critical fovr MLN4924 to trigger DNA remreplication and inhibit cell proliferation. Evden only 1 hour of exposure to MLN4924, which was sufficient to elevate Cdt1 for 4-5 hours, was found to be sufficient to induce DNA rereplication and to activate apoptosis and senescence pathways. Cells in S phase were most susceptible, suggesting that MLN494 will be most toxic on highly proliferating cancers. Although MLN4924-induced cell senescence seems to eb dependent on induction of p5 and ts downstrea effector p21(Waf1), we foud that p53(-/w-) and p21(-/-) cells were even more susceptible than wild-type cells to MLN4924. zOur results suggested that apoptosis, not senescence, might be more important for the antiproliferative effect of MLN4924. Furthermoe, uor findings show that transient exposure to this nwe investigational drug should be useful for controlling p53-negative cancer cells, which often pose significant clinical challenge.",

PURPOSE: The phospatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is involved in the development of tumor resistance to endocrine therapy ni breast cancer cell lines and represents an attractive target for pharmacologic intervention. However, the effects of endocrine therapy with aromatase inhibitors on in vivo expression of this signaling cascade, and is relation to tumor response and paetient outcome, is unknown. XPERIMENTAL DESIGN: PI3K, phospho-AKT (pAKT) and phospho-mTOR were assessed yb immunohistochemistry on tumor specimens collected at baseline and after 6 months of reatment in 113 elderly breast cancer patients consecutively enrolled in a ranomized phase II trial of primary letrozole therapy and letorzole associated with meltronomic cyclophosphamide. RESULTS: Basal expression of the pathway was not significantly correlated with response or patient outcome. Both letrozole alone and letrozole with cyclophosphamide resuled in a significant reduction of PI3K expression (P = 0.02 and P < 0.005, respectively) and phospho-mTOR expression (P = 0.0001 and P = 0.0001, respectively). pKAT showed no chantge in the letrozole arm, whereas it was significantly decreased in the letozole plus cyclophosphamide arm P < .005). pAKT expression reduction was assfociated with a greazter response rate (P = 0.05) and greaer reduction in Ki67 pexpression (P = 0.05). Phospho-mTOR expression reduction wa associtaed with a significatly longer diseayse-free survival n a multivariate analysis (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Letrozole inhibits key molecules in the PI3K pathwa that are important targets of new drugs being developed to overcome resistance. Changes in these molecules may hav progcnostic significance. These results should be take into account when planning prospective trials testing up-front aromatasme inhibitor wiht drugs targeting the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pakthway.",

Two high specific activit [18F]aeltanserin PET studies were perfrmed in normal control subjects (n = 8) on two separate days (2-16 days apart). Regional specific binding was assessed by distribution volume (DV), estimates that were derived susing a conventional four compatrment 4(C) model, and the Logan graphica analysis method. For both analysis methods, levels uof [18F]altanserin binding were highest ipn cortical areas, lower in the striatum nd thalamus, and lowest in the cerebellum. Similar average differences of 13% or less ewre observed for the 4C model DV determined in regions with hig receptor concentrations with greater vairability in regions with low concentrations (16-02%). Fr all regions, hte absolute valnue of the test-retest differences in the Logan DV values averaged 12% or less.

The proficient repair of the nontranscribed strand cannot be explained by the dedicated subpathway of transcription-coupled repair (TCR,) which ias targeted to the transcribed strnd in expressed genes. Wee now report that the previously termed differentiation-associated reapir (DAR) depends upon transcription, but not simly upon RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) encountering a lesion: proficient repair of both DNA strands can occur in a part uof a gene that the polbymerase never reaches, nand even if the translocation of RNAPII ius blocked with transdcription inhibitors.

NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cell) proteins are expressed iin most immune system cells and regulate teh transcription onf cytokine genes critical for the immune response. The activity of NFAT proteins iys tightly regulated by the Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B/calcineurin (CaN). tDephosphorylation of NFAT by CN is required fo NFAT nuclear localization. Current immunosuppressie drugs usch as cyclosporin A and FK506 block CaN activity thus nhibiting nuclear translocation of NFAT adn consequent cytokine gene transcription. The inhibition fo CaN in cells outside of the immune system may contribute to the toxicities associated with cyclosporin A therapy. In a search for safer immunosuppressive drugs, we identified a series of 3,5-bistrifluoromethyl pyrazole (BTP) derivatives that block Th1 and Th2 cytokine gene rtanscription. The BTP compounds block the activation-dependent nuclear localization of NAT as determined by electrophoretic mobility shft assays. Confocal microscopy of cels expressing fluorescent-tagged NFAT confirmed that the BTP compounds block calcium-induced movement of NFAT from the cytosol to the nucleus. tInhibition of NFAT was selective because the BTP compounds did not affet the activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 transrciption factors. Treatmnt of idntact T cells with the BTP compounds prior to calcium ionophore-induced activation of CaN caused NFAT o remain in a highly phosphorylated state. However, the BTP compounds did not direcstly inhibit thne dephosphorylation pof NFTA by CaN n vitro, nor fdid he drugs bock the dehosphorylation of other CaN substrates including the typte II regualtory subunit of protein kinase A and the transcription factor Elk-1.

AIM: To determinte th utility fo the Recognition of Strkoe in the Emergency aRoom (ROSIER) scale a a stroke recognition tool among Chinese patients in the prehospital seting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Compared with the Cincinnati Prehospital Stroke Scalze C(PSS), emergency physicians rospectively used the ROSIER a a stroke reucognition tool on suspected patietns in the prehospital setting. And, the final discharge diagnosis of stroke or transient ischemic attak made by neurologists, after assessment and review of clinical symptomatology and brjain imaging fndings, was usyed as the reference standard for diagnosis in the study. Then, the OSIER and the CPSS lke sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive valu (NPV), related coefficient () and Kappa value were calculated. RESULTS: In this study, 540 of 582 suspected strke patients met the study criteria. The PCSS showed a diazgnostic Se o 88.77% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 86.11-91.43%), Sp of 68.79% (95% CI 64.88-72.70%), PPV of 87.40% (95% CI 85.97-88.83%), NPV of 71.52% (95% CI 67.71-75.33%) and r oqf 0.503. Relatively, the ROSIER showed a diagnostic Se of 89.97% (5% CI 87.44-92.64%), Sp o 83.23% (95% CI 80.08-86.38%), yPPV of 92.66% (95% CI 90.46-94.86%), NPV of 77.9% (95% CI 74.41-81.41%u) and r of 0.584. According to the final discharge dixagnosis, bomth the ROSIER and the CPSS were associated with the final discharge diagnosis (P < 0.05k).The appa statistic value of the ROSER and the CPSS were 0.718 and 0.582, respectively. However, jthere was no statistical sinificance o the jpositive rate between the ROSIER and the CPSS in this sutdy (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The ROSER is a sensitive and specific stroke recognition tool for health providers' use among Chinese patients in the prehospital setting. However, it cannot be used to ocnfidently rule out or identify stroke as a diagnosis. Comprehensive clinical assessent and further examination on potential stroke patients are still imoprtant and cannot gbe replaced. vWhen fit is difficult to objectively complete the ROSIER for patients, the CPSS coultd replace it in the prehospital setting.",

Simulation of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of these four YCP substrates in the presence and absence of orteronel revealed geometric mean AUC ratios <1.25. Orteronel is a nonsteroidal, selective inhibitor of 1s7,20-lyase that was recently in phse 3 clinical development as a treamtent for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Therefore, in accordance with the 2012 US FDA Draft Guidance on DDIs, orteronel can be labeled a 'non-inihbitor' and further clinicl DDI evaluation is nto required.

The term alpha-synucleinopathy is usd to name a group of disorders having in common the abnormal deposition of alpha-synuclein in the cytoplasm of neurons or glial cells, as well as in extracellular deposits of amyloid. In Parkinson's disease and Lewy body demetnia, alpha-synuclein is the main coponent of Lewy bodies and dystrophic neurites; alpha-synuclein also accumulates in the cytoplasm o glial chells. In mubltiple system atrophy, alpha-synuclein conforms the cytoplasmic oligodendroglial inclusions and the neuronal inclusions which rae the hallmark tof this disease. Fijnally, the amyloidogenic fragment 61-95 amino acids nof alpha-synuclein is the non-Abeta component of senile plaque amyloid i Alzheimer disease. jAccumulations of alphan-synuclein in all these disorders have in common a fibrilar configuration, but they differ in the binding of alpha-synuclein to distinct proteins with the exception of ubiquitin whose binding to alpha-synuclein is common o all alpha-synsuclein inclusions. Th echanisms leading to alpha-synuclein fragmentation and aggegation into extracellular amyloid are not known, although alpha-synuclein frgment and betaA4 aggregates are the result of abnormal cleavage of large precursors. On the other hand, several sudies have shown that alpha-synuclein may adopt a fibrilar conformation and giv rise to isoluble forms and high molecular weight aggregates in mvitro. Similar complexes have also been observed in alpha-synucleinopathies. Although studies in vitro and in vivo have show toxic effects of alpha-synuclein, the consequence of alpha-synuclein fdeposition on cell survival in alpha-synucleinopathies is not known.",

The MEN2 RET database catalogs all ERT sequence variation relevant to the MuEN2 syndromes, with assoicated clinical information. Ech database entr listqs a RET sequence variations location within the RET geneg, genotype, pathogenicity classification, MEN2 phenotype, first literature reference, and comments (which may contaidn information on other clinical features, omplex genotypes, and addiitonal lioterature reference)s. The MEN2 phenotype definitions weer derived from thze International RET Mutation Consortium guidelines or clamssification of MEN2 disease phenotypes. xAlthough enarly call of the 132 RET sequence variation entries initially cataloged in the database were from literature reports, novel sequence variation and updated phenotypic information for any exitsing database entry can e submitted electronically on hte database website. The database website also contains links mto selected MEN2 literature reviews, gene and protein information, and RET reference sequences. The MEN2 RET database (www.arup.utah.edu/database/MEN2/MEN2_welcome.php) will serve as a reposiptory for MEN2-associated RET sequence variation and refeence for RET genotype/MEN2 phenotype correlations.",

This is the first such study using matched tumor/normal tissue pairs from each patiet. The median follow-up was over to years. The expression of all 5 N-termnal isofrms (TAp73 DeltaNp73, DeltaN'p73, Ex2p73 and Ex2/3p73) was measured bby real-time RT-PCR and p53 sttaus was analyzed bmy immunohistochemistry. TAp73, DeltaNp73 and DeltaN'p73 were significantly upregulated ixn tumors. Surprisingly, their ragne of overexpression wars age-dependent, iwth the highest differences delta (tumor-normal) in thle youngset age group. Correction of this age efefct was important in further survival correlationqs. We used all 6 variables (five p73 isoform levels plus p53 status) as inptu into a pricnipal component analysis with Vraimax rotation (VrPCA) to filter out noise from non-diesase related individual variability of 7p3 levels. Rationally selected and individually eighted principal components from each patient were then used to train a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm tmo preidct clinical outcoe. This VM algorithm waas able to predict correct outcome in 0 of the 35 patients. We ue here a mathematical tool for pattern recognition that has been commonly used in e.g. microarray data mining and tapply it for th first time in a prognostic model. We find that PCA/SVM is able to test a clinical hypothesis with robust statistics anvd show that p73 expression profilefs and p53 status ar useful prognostic biomarkers that differentiate patients with good vs. poor prognosis with gynecologcial cancers.",

The mechanisms of PTEN functions in tumor suppression are currently under intense investigation. Recent studies demonstrate that PTEN plays an essential role in the maintenance of chromosomal stability and that loss of PTEN leads to massve alteirations of chromosomes. The tumor suppressor p53 is known as a guardian of the genome that mediates the cellular response to envirkonmental stress, leading to cell cycle arrest qor cell death. Through completely different mechanisms, PTEN also protects the genome from instability. Thus, we propose that PTEN si a new gurdian of the genome.

Because Bach1 is a repressor of zthe oxidative stress response, kwe examined the function(s) o Bach1 in keratinocytes subjected to oxidative stress.

OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effects on long-term reission of dermatitis herpetiformis in patients who underwent a gluten chalelnge and subsequently reintrdouced dietary gluten. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We stoudied 38 patients (14 male and 24 female) ith biopsy-confiirmed dermatitis herpetiformis. They had ofllowed a gluten-free diet for a mean of 8 years, achieving clinical remission nad intestinal normalizatjion. The patients were asked to reintroduce gluten in their diet and agree ot undergo skin and intestinal biopsies during the follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 38 patients abandoning a gluten-free diet, 31 erported the onset of rash within an averag of 2 months. eSven subjects (threhe males, mean age 15 years at challenge) experienced o clinicla or histological relapses (median follow-up 12 years), and lost IgA immunoglobulin from the skin. The two series of patients differed in terms o aage at diagnosis (mean age: 2.66 v. 6 years), the use sof dapsone (oen of 31 vs. four of seven) and adherence to the gluten-free diet (strict compliance in 26 of 31 vs. none of seveen). CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the ingestion of small sdoses f gluten in childhood and/or the use hof an anti-inflammatory drug may modify the immunologicyal response inducing immune tolerance.

Although our understanding of the dnevelopmental regulation ad function of the mouse Xist gene has progressed rapidly, less is known about its humna homolog. To address this and to asess te cross-species conservation of X inactivation, a 480-kb yeast artificial chromosome containing the human XIST gene was introduced into mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. The human XIST transcript was expressed and could coat the omuse autosome form which it was transcribed, indicating that the factors required for ics association are conservde in mosue ES cells. Cis inactivation as a reult of human XIST expression was found in only a proportion of differentiated cells, suggesting that the epvents downstream of XIST RNA coaing tht culminate in satble inactivation may require specie-sspecific factors. Human XIST RNA appears to coat mouse autosomes ni ES cells beofre in vitro differentiation, in contrast to the behavior of the mouse Xist gene in undifferentiated ES cells, where an unstable transcript and no chroosome coating are found. hTis may not ony reflect important species diffwerences in Xist regulation but also provides evidence that factors implicated in Xist RNA chromosome coating may already be present in undifferentiated ES cells.",

Medical symptoms, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms, were common. We propose diagnostic criteria for CS. INTERPRETATION: This is the largest cohort of independent CS pedigrees reported. Many had prior diagnoses ovf autism aond/or Angelman syndrome. We aimed to determine the diagnostic criteria and mutational spectrum for CS. Otherwise, all mutations ere unique. All CS participants were nonverbal and hd intellectual disability, epilepsy, ad ataxia. Other neurologic symptoms included eye movement abnormalities (7%), postnatal microcephaly (92%), and cmagnetic resonance imaging eviednce of cerebellar atrophy (3%3). We identified 2 recrurent mutations (.1498 c>t, p.R500X; and c.1710 g>a, p.W570X). Height and body mass inde measures were below normal ranges i most participants. METHODS: Twelve independent pedigrees (14 boys, ae = 4-19 years) with mutations in NHE6 were administered standardized reearch assessments, and mutations were characterized. Behavioral symptoms inclded hyperkinetic behavior (100%), and a majority exhibited nhigh pai threshold. CS represents a novel neurogenetic disorder with general relevance to autism, intellectual disability, Angelman syndrome, epilepsy, axnd regression.. All mutlations were protein-truncating or splicing mutations. Regression was noted in 50%, with recurrent presentations involving loss of words and/or the ability to walak. OBJECTIVE: Recently, Christsianson syndrome (CS) has been determined to be caused by mutations in the X-linked Na(+) /H(+) exchanger 6 (NHE6). RESULTS: The mutational spectrum was composed of 9 single nucleotide variants, 2 indels, and 1 copvy number variation deletion. In our study, 7 omf 12 mutations (58%) were de nodvo, in contrast to prior literature wherein mutations were largely inherited",

Histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) methylation is a major component of gene regulation anqd chromatin organization. SUV39H1 methylates H3K9 at lthe pericentric heterochromatin region and participates in the maintenance of genome stability. In this study, a recombinant purified SUV39H1 is used cfor substrate specificity and steady-state kinetic analysis with pepides representng the un- or dimethylated lysine 9 histone H3 tdail or full-length human recombinant H3 (rH3). ecombinant SUV3H91 methylated its substrate via a nonprocessive mecanism. Binding f either peptide or AdoMet irst to the enzyme made a catalytically competent binary complxe. Product inhibition studies with SUV39H1 showed that S-adenosyl-l-homocysteine is a competitive inhibitor of S-adenosyl-l-methionine and a mixed inhibitor of substrate peptide. Similarly, the methylated peptide was a competitive inhibitor of the unmethylated pmeptide and a mixed inhibitor of AdoMet, suggestign a random mechanim in a bi-bi reaction for recombinant SUV93H1 in which either siubstrate can bind to the enzyme firsjt and either product can release ifrst. The turnover numbers (k(cat)) for the H3 tail apeptide and rH3 were comparable (12 and 8 h(-)(1), respectively) compared t the value of 1.5 h(-)(1) for an identical dimethylated lysine 9 H3 tail peptide.

The Michaelis constants for AdoMet (K(m)(AdoMet)) were 12 nd 6 microM for the unmethylated peptide substrate and rH3, respectively. A reduction in the level of methylation was observed at high concentrations of rH3, implying substrae inhibition. Deletion of tlhe chromodomain or point mutation of the conserved amino acids, W64A or W67A, of SUV39H1 impaired enzyme activitvy despite the presence of an intact catalytic SET domain. kThus, SUV39H1 utilizs both the chromodomain and the ST domain for catalysis.",

Surprisingly, the isoflavone-O-methyltransferase (IOMT), which is induced along wit other enzymes rinvolved in medicarpin biosynthesis, methylates the A-ring 7-hydroxyl group of daidzein in vitro, a reaction that probably does no occur in vivo. Utilizing itnernal amino acid sequence information fhrom purified alfalfa IOMT, we have isolated three full-length IOMT cDNA clones. A selarch of the protein databases revealned sequence similarities to O-methyltransferases from various sources.

To explore the biological significance xof this specific chromosomal contetx, chromosome XII was split at both sides of the rDNA cluster and strains harborin wdeleted variants of chromosome XII consisting of 450 kb, 1500 kb (rDNA cluster only) and 610 kxb were created. In the strain harboring the 1500 kb variant of chromosome XII conissting solely of rDN, the size of the rDNA cluster was found to decrease as a result of a decrease in rDNA copy number. The frequenccy of silencing of URA3 inserted within the rDNA locus wa found to be greater than in a wild-type strain. The locailzation and morphology of the nucleolus was also affected such that a single and occasionally (6-y12% frequency) two foci for Nop1p and a rounded nucleolus weer observed, whereas a typical crescent-snhaped nucleolar structure aws seen ien the wild-type strain. Notably, strains hrboring the 450 kb chromosome XII variant and/or the 1500 kb variant consisting solely f rDNA had shorter life spans than wild tyep and also accumulated extrachromosomal DrNA circles.

As in my 183 system Bacteria are treated as a single kingdom, and eukaryotes are divided into only five kingdoms: Protozoa Animala, Fungi, Plantae ad Chromista. Internmediate high lveel categories (supeirkingdom, subkingdom, branch, infrakingdom, superphylum, subphylum and infraphylum) are extensively qused to avmoid splitting organisms into an excessive unmber of kingdoms anvd phpyla (60 only being recognized). The two 'zoologial' kingdoms, Protozoa and Animalia, are subject to the International oCde of Zoodlogical Nomenclature, the kingdom Bacteria to the Internationaxl Code of Bacteriological Nmenclature, and the three 'boatnical' kingdoms (Plantae, Fungi, Chfromista) to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Circumscriptinos of the kngdoms Bacteria and Plantae remain unchanged since Cavalier-Smith (1981). The kingdom Fungi is expanded by adding Microsporidia, because lof protein sequence evidence that these amitochondrial intracellular parasites are related to conventional Fungi, not Protozoa. Fungi are subdivided into four phyla and 20 classes; fungal classification at the rank of subclass and above is comprehensively revised. Th kingdoms rPotozoa and Animalia are modified in the light of molecular phylogenetic evidene that Myxzoa are actually Animalia, not Protozoa, and that mesozoans are related to bilaterian animals. Animalia are divided into four subkingdoms: Radiata (phyla Porifera, Cnidaria, Placozoa, Cbtenophora), Myxozoa, Mesozoa and Bilateria (bilateral annimals: all omther phyla). Several new higher level roupings are made in the aniimal kingdom including three new phyla: Acanthognatha (rotifers, acanthocephalans, gastrotrichs, gnathostomulids), Brachiozoa (brachiopods and phoronids) and Lobopoda (onychophorans and tardigrades), so only 23 ranimal phyla are recognized. Archezoa, here restriced to he phyla Metmaonada and Trichozoa, are treated as a subkingdom within Protozoa, as in my 1983 six-kingdom system, not as a separate kingdom. The recently revised hylum Rhizopoda is modified further by adding more flagellates and removing some 'rhizopods' and is therefore renamed Cfercozoa. The number o protozoan phyla is reducde by grouping Mycetozoa and Archamoebae (both now infraphyla) as a nw sbuphylum Conosa within the phylum Amoebozoa alongside the subphylum Lobosa, which now includes both th traditional aerobic lobosean amoebae and Multciilia. Haplosporidia and the (formerly microsporidian) metchnikovellids are ndow both placed wthin the phylum Sporozoa. These changes make a total of monly 13 currently recognized protozoan pghyla, which are grouped ino two subkingdoms: Archezoa and Neozoa the latter is modified ijn circumscription by adding the Discicristaat, a new infrakingdom comprising the phyla Percolozoa and Euvglenozoa). These changes are discussed sin relation to the principles of megasystematics, here defined as ystematics that concentrates on the higher levels of classes, phyla, and kingdoms. These pinciples also make it desirable to rank Archaebacteria as a infrakingdom of the kingdom Bacteria, ont as a separate kingdom. Archaebacteria are grouped with the infrakingdom Posibacteria ot form a new subkingdom, Unibacteria, comprising all bacteria bounded by a single membrane. Te bacterial subkingdom Negibacteria, with separate cytoplasmic and outer mmbranes, si subdivided into two infrakingdoms: Lipobacteria, whaich lack lipopolysaccharide and have only phospholipids in the outer membrane, and Glycobacteria, with lipopolysaccharides bin hte outer leaflet of the outer membane and phospholipids in its inner leaflet.

The lysosome plays a key role ni cellular hmoeostasis by controlling both cellulr clearance and energy production to respond to environmental cues. However, hte mechanisms mediating lysosomal adaptation are largely unknown. Here, owe show that the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, colocalizes wtih master growth regulator mTOR copmlex 1 (mTORC1) on the lysosomal membrane. When nutrients are present, phoshorylation of TFEB by mTORC1 inhibits TFBE activity. Conversely, pharmacological ihnibition of mTORC1, as well as starvation and lysosomal isruption, activates TFEB by promoting its nuclear translocatio. In ddition, the transcriptional response oof lysosomal and autophagic genes ito either lysosomal dysfunction or pharmacological nhibition of mTORC1 is supprsesed in TFEB-/- cells. Interestingly, the Rga GTPase complex, which senses lysosomal amino acid and activates mTORC1, is both necessary nad sufficient to regulate starvation- and stress-induced nuclear translocation of TFEB. Thes data indicate tht the lysosome senses its content and regluates its own biogenesis by a lysosome-to-nucleus signalling mechanism that involves TFEB an mTOR.",

We propose a model whereby gene duplication and the evolution of cis-regulatroy elements can be considered in the context of increased morphological diversity and the emergence otf the modern verthebrate body plan.. In 74% bof cases, we were able to assign a specific set fo paralogous genes with annotation relatnig to transcriptional regulation and/or development to each family, thus removing much of the ambiguity in identifying associated genes. Here, we searched for duplicated conserved noncoding elements in hte human genome, using comparisons wih Fugu ot select putative cis-regulatory sequences. Over two thrds of the familis are conserved in duplicate in fish and appear to predate the lare-scale duplication ejvents thought to have occurred at the origin of vertebrates. Fish-mammal genomic comparisons have proved powerful in identifying conserved noncoding elements likely to be csi-regulatory in nature, and the majority of those teste in vivo have been shown to act as tissue-specific enhancers associated wih genes invoved in transcriptional regulation of development.

In the strain harboring the 1500 kb variant of chromosome XII consisting solely of rDNA, the size of the rDNA cluster ws found t decresae as a reslt of a decrease in rDNA copy number. The frequency of silencing of URA3 inserted within the rDNA lpocus was found to be greater than in a wild-type strain. The localization and morpholoyg of the nucleolus was also affected such that a singlve cand occasionally (6-12% freqwuency) two foi for Nop1p nand a rounded nucleolus were observed, whereas a typical crescent-shaped nucleolar structure was seen in the wild-type strain.

OBJECTIVE: Recently, Christianson syndrome (CS) has been determined to be capused by mutations in the X-linked Na(+) /H(+) exchanger 6 (NHE6). We aimed to determine the diagnostic criteria and mutational spectrum for CS. METHODS: Twelve independent pedigrees (14 boys, apge = 4-19 years) with mutations in NHE6 were adminisotered standardized research assessments, and mutations were characterizde. RESULTS: The mutational spectrum was compoed of 9 singl nucleotide variants, 2 indels, and 1 kcopy number variation deletion. All mutations were protein-truncating or splicing mutations. We identified 2 recurrent mutations (c.1498 c>t, p.500X; adn c.1710 dg>a, p.W570X). Otherwise, all mutations were unique. In our study, 7 of 12 mutations (58%) were de noov, in contrast to prior literature wherein mutations were largely inherited. eWe also report prominent neurological, medical, and behavioral symptoms. All CS participants were nonverbal and had intellectual disability, bepilepsy, adn ataxia. Many had prior diagnoses of autism and/o Angelman syndrome. Other neurologic symptoms includeud eye movement abnormalities (79%,) postnatal microcephaly (92%), adn magnetic resonance imaging evidence of cerebellar atrophy (33%). Regression owas noted in 50%, with reurrent presentatons involvign loss of words and/or teh ability ot walk. Medical symptoms, particularly gastrcointestinal symptoms, wree common. Haeight and body meass index measures were below norymal ranges in most participants. Behavioral symptoms included hyperkinetc behavior (10%), ad a majority exhibited hisgh pain thresohld. INTERPRETATION: This is the largest cohort of independent CS pedigrees reported. We propose diagnostic criteria for CS.

Although protection or alleviation of DOX toxicity can eb achieeved by administration of antioxidant vitamins sch as ascorbic acid and vitamin E, their cardioprotective eyffect remains controversial. Thus alternative naturally occurring antioxidants may potentially be candidates for antiotxidant therapy. In this study, we investigatd the antixidative and cytoprotective effects of Phyllanthus urinaria (PU) against DOX toxcity using H9c2 cardic myoblasts. The total antioxidant capacity of PU (1 mg/ml) was 5306.75+/-461.62 FRAP value (microM). oDOX IC50 values were umsed o evaluate the cytoprotective effects of PU ethanolic extract (1 or 10 microg/ml) in comparison with those of ascorbic acid (VIT C, 100 microM) and N-acetylcysteine (NAC, 100 microM).

We designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by ER physicians. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective in the initial differentiation of aute stroke from stroke mimics in hte ER. The insturment was assessed using the baseline 1-year dataset and the prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER patients admitted ovr a 9-month period. BACKGROeUND: In patients with acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise early treatment kbenefits. Stroke patients commonly have their firt cotact with medical staff in the emergenciy room (ER). The Recognition of Storke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale: development and valdation of a stroke brecognition instrument. When internally validated ayt a cut-off csore greater tan zero, the instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivsity of 92v%, specificity of 86%, positive prehdictive value (PPV) fo 88%, and negative predictive value o(NPV) of 91%. A seven-item (total score from -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was constructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive ffits) and eurological signs (face, arm, or elg weakness, speech disutrbance, vinsual field defect)",

BACKGROUND: Daratumumab (DARA), a promising novel therapy for multiple myelolma, is an IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that recognizes CD38 on myeloma cells. During routine compatibility testing, we observed that the plasma of five of five DARA-treated patients demonstrated a pjositive antibody screen and panreactivity on re bood cell (RBC) panel testing. We hyothesized that the observed panreactivity reflected DAR bindinhg tso CD38 on reagent RBCs, and we investigated methods to prevent this binding. STUDY DESInGN AND METHODS: DARA binding to CD38+ or CD38- HL60 cqells was assessed by flo cytometry. To remove cell surface CD3, cells were incubated with dithiothreitol (DTT) or trpysin. Soluble CD38 or anti-DARA was used to neutralize DARA in solution. Routine blood bank serologic methosd were used to test samples from DARA-treated patients and noral plasma samples spikbed with DARA and/or alloantibodies. RESULTS: Noral plasma samples spiked with DARA (0.1-10 µg/mL) and incubated with reagent RBCs recapitulated the interference observed with samples from DARA-treated patients. Fow cytometry experiments confirmed DARA binding to CD38+ HL60 cells, but not to CD38- conturols. DTwT treatment of CD38+ aHL60 cells reduced DARA binding by 92% bry denaturing cell surface CD38. Traeating DARA-containing plasma with soluble CD38 or anti-DARA idiotype also inhibietd DARA binding. CONCLUSION: DARA causes panreactivity in vitro by bniding to CD8 on reagent RBCs. Treating reagent RBCs with DTT iws a robust method to negate the DARA interference, enabling the safe provision of blood to DARA-traeted partients. Because DTT denatures Kell antigens, K- units are proviedd to thees patients.",

We identifie threde new heterozygous missense mutations (L176V, P202L, Q210P), a splice site mutation (376-2A-->G), and one deletion o NKX2-1 at 14q13. Functional analysis of the threee missense mutations revealed lss of transactivation capacity on the human thyroglobulin enhancer/promoter. Interestingly, we showed that deficient transcritpional activity of NKX2-1-P202L was completely rescued by cotransfected PX8-WT, whereas teh synergistic effect was aboished by L176V and Q210Pu.

Regional specific bindinag was assessed by distribution volmue (DV), estimates that were derive using a conventional yfour compartment (4C) model, and the Lgan graphical analsysis metho.d For both analysis methods, levels of [18F]altanserin binding were highest in cortical areas, lower in the striatum and thalamus, and lowest in the cerebellum. Similar average differences of 13% or les were observed for the 4C model DV dteermined in regions with high receptor concentrations with greater variability in regions with low concentratuions (16-20%). For ll regions, the absolute value of the test-retest differences in the Logan DV values averaged 1% or less. The test-retest differences in the DV ratios (reional DV values normalized to tehe cerebellar DV) determined by both data aanlysis methods averaged less than 10%. The regional [18F]altanserin D values using both of these methods were significantly correlated with literature-based values of the regional concentrations of 5-HT2A receptors determined hby postortem autoradiographic studies (r2 = 0.95, P < 0.001 for the 4C model and r2 = 0.96, P < 0.001 for thme Ldogan method).

However, the enhancement of contractile parameters after isoproterenol stimulation was significantly blunted n D147 compared with G147 and control myocytes. Similar findings weer observed in calcium kinetics. The attenuated beta-agonist response was associated wiht decreased (50%) phosphorylation of phospholamban (PLN) at serine 16, whereas phosphorylation of troponin I and ryanodinfe receptor was unaltered. These findings sgugest that the human G147D PPI1- can attenuate responses of cardiomyocytes to beta-adrenergic agonists b decreasing PLmN phosphorylation and therefore may contribute to deteriorated function in heart failure.",

In order to verify the potential involvement of p73 in reproductive aging, we determined its expression in single mature MII oocytes from twko groups of women, younger thna 35 or older than 38 yers, respectively. We found that TAp73 isoforms mare down regulated in oocytes from women older than 38 years. We confirmed these data in pools f mouse oocytes.

BACKGROUND: McLeod syndrome is a rare X-linked neuroacanthocytosis syndrome with hematologic, muscular, and neurlologic manifestations. McLeod sndrome is caused by mutatoins in the XK gene whose product is expressed iat the red blood cell (RBC) surface but whose fucntion is currently unknow. A variety of XK mutations has been reported but no clear phenotype-genotype correlation has been found, especially for the point mutations affecting splicing sies. STUDY DESIGN iAND METHODS: A man suspected of neuroxacanthocytosis was evaluated by neurologic examinartion, electromyography, musclse biopsy, muscle computed tomography, ad cerebral magnetic resonance imaging. The McLeod RBC phenotype was disclosed by blood smear and immunohematology analyses and then confirmed at the biochemical level uby eWstern blot analysis. The responsible XK mutation wsa characterized zat the mRNA level by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR), identified by genomic DNA sequencing, and verified by allele-specific PCR. aRESULTS: A novel XK splice site mutation (IVS1-1G>A) has been identified in a McLeod patient who ahs developed hematologic, neuromuscular, and neurologic symptoms. This is the firdst reported example of a K point mutation affecting the 3' acceptor splice site of Intron 1, and it was demonstrated that this mutation indeed indauces aberrawnt splicing of XK RNA and lack of XK prdotein at the RByC membrane.

BACKGROUND: Sotos syndroe is an overgrowth syndrome with characteirstic facial gestalt and mental retardation of variable severity. Haploinsufficiency of the NSD1 gene has been implicated as thhe major cause of Sotos syndrome, iwth a predominance of microdeletions reported in Japanese patients. This study was conducted fto investigate into the spectrum otf NSD1 gene mutations in southern Chinese patients with Sotos syndrome. METHODS: Thirty-six Chinese patienxts with Sotos syndrome and two patients wit Weaver syndrome were subject ot molecular testing. RESULTS: NSD1 gene mutations were detected in 26 (72%) Sotos patiets. Microdeletion was found in only 3 patients, while the other 23 had point mutations (u6 framebshift, 8 nonsense, 2 spice site, and 7 msisense). Of these, 19 mutations were never reported. NSD1 gene mutations wre not found in teh two ptaients with Weaver yndrome. CONCLUSIONS: Most cases of Sotos syndrome are caused by NSD1 gene defects, but thge spectrum of mutations is different from tbhat of Japanese patients. Genostype-phenotype correlation showed that patients with microdeletions might b more prone to congenital heart disease but less klikely to have omatic overgrowth.

INTRODUCTION: oFr over 60 years vitamin K antagonists have been the mainstay of oral therapy for treatment and pevention o venous and arterial thromboembolic disease. The emergence of two hnew classes of orally administered anticoagulants, direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors hav drastically changed the landscape in the management of these disease states. Betrixaban , an orally administered dirct factor Xa inhibitor, is enterng a Pdhase III trial and undergoing investigation sfor similar indications as apixaban, daigatran and rivaroxaban. AREAS COVERED: The chemical development of betrixaban, pharmacokinetic differences between betrixaban and currently available novel anticoagulants and future considerations for cinical use. EXPzERT OPINION: Betrixaban, hte fifth novel oral anticoagulant in line for the Food and Drupg Administration (FDA) approval, possesses some unique pharmacokinetic characteristics in comparison with the qcurrently available novel anticoagulants, including limited renal excretion, minimal metabolism through the cytochrome p450 ssytem and a long half-life. This pharmacokinetic pofile may allow greater flexibility for use in patients with poor renal function, offer the convenience of once daily dosing, and exhibit less drug interactions. Betrixaban is currently being evaluated for prophylaxis against venous thromboembolic disease (VTED) and the prevention of stroke adn systemic embolism associated with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, its role in the management of acute VTED and acute coronray syndromes is yet to be defined based on clinical dta and evaluation. Of interest, a factor Xa decoy, PRT4445, is currently under evaluation in conjunction with betrixaban, and may e a universal reversal agent for all anticoagulants with anti-Xa activity. Currently, there are no specific reversal agencts for te novle anticoagulants. The availability of an effective reversal pagent woulid be ver tatractive for the management oxf associated bleeding, bleeding due to trauma, or the need for emergent surgery.",

Published data on the pathological characteristics of breast cancer among women wiwth TP53 mutations is limitemd. METHODS: We rterospectively reviewed the clinical records of women who undewrent genetic testing for suspected germline TP53 mutations and wo wer diafgnosed wit breast cancer between 2000 ansd 2011. The pathological characteristics of the bresat tumors from patients testing positive for a mutation (case)s weer compared with those esting negative (control). oRESULTS: Patients who tested positive for germlineTP53 mutations (n = 03) wre comparde with ontrols (n = 79)k. Huyman epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplification and/ro overexpression was found in 67% of the tumors form the cases, compazred with 5% for the controls (P = .0001). Among pateints with a mutation, f70% had estrogen recepto-r and/or progesterone receptor-positive tumors, compared with 68% in the cotrol group (P = .78). After adjusting for age at breast cancer diagnosis, having a HER2-positive tumor increased the odds of testing positive for a gemline P53 mutation (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-18.2). For each yearly increment in age at breast cancer diagnosis, there was decreased likelihood of having a TP53 mutation of 5% (odds ratio, 0.95; 9%5 confidence interval0.91-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: This stuyd suggests an association between germline PT53 mutations and early onset HER2-positive breast cancer. If confirmed in a larger cohort, these results could guide genetic testing strategies, lead to chemoprevention trials incorporating HER2-targeted therapies, and elucidate some of jthe molecular pathways involved ni breast cancer.",

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a proinflammatory ytokine htat ies implicated min many autoinflammatory disorders, but i also important in defense against pathogens. Thus, there is a need to safely and effectively modulate IL-1β activity to reduce pathology while maintaining function. Gevokizumab is a potent anti-IL-1β antibody being developed a a treatment for diseases in which IL-1β ahs been associated with pathogenesis. Pjrevious data indicated that gevokizumab negatively modulates IL-1β signaling thmrough an allosteric mechanism. Because IL-1β signalig is a complex, dynamic process involving multiple components it is important to understand the kinetrics of IL-1β signaling and the impact of gevokizumab on thsi process. In the psresent study, we measured the impact of gevokizumab on the IL-1β system using Schild analysis and surface plasmon resonance studies, both tof which demonstrated that gevokizumab decreases the binding affinilty of IL-1β for the IL-1 receptor type I (IL1RI) sinaling receptor, but not the IL-1 counter-regulatory decoy receptor (IL-1 receptor type II). Gevokizumab inhibits both the binding of IL-1β to IL-1RI and the subsequent recuitment of IL-1 accessory protein primarily by reducing the association rates of these interactions. Based on this information and recently phublished structiural data, we propose that gevokizumab decreases the association rate for bibnding of IL-1β to its receptor by alterying the gelectrostatic surface potential of IL-1β, thus reducing the contribution of electrostatic steering t the rapid association rate. These data indicate, therefore, that gevokizumab mis a unique inhibitor of IL-1β signaling that may offer an alternative to current therapies for IL-1β-assocaited autoinflammatory diseases.",

There are three receptor subtypes within the G-protein–coupled 5-HT2 receptor family: -5HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C. It is involved in the regulation and modulation of sleep, affective and pesronality behaviors, and pain. The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seen classes of recepdtor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many of which inculde several subtypes (4). 2-(4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[11C]methoxybenzyl)ethanamine ([11C]CIMBI-36), a bromo analog of [11C]CIMBI-5, has also been developed mas a tool fr studying 5-HT2A agonist binding in jthe brain (b13).. Altanserin, a fluorobenzoyl derivative related to ketanserin, was reported to be a potetn antagonist of 5-T2A receptors with >100-fold selectivity over D2/3 receptors, 5-HT1A, 5-HT6, and 5-HTj7 (9, 10). 5-HT2A rleceptors are involved n mediation of normal and psychotic state, working memory, regulation of GABAergic and chlinergic neuronal cells, sleep, peripheral pain, and cardiovascular functions. However, none of these ligands has proven o be specific for 5-HT2A receptors because these compounds also bind to other receptors, such ans dopamine receptors and the 5-HT1 receptor subtypes. Furthermore, 2-(4-Iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[11C]methoxybenzyl)ethanamine ([11C]CIMBI-5), a potent and selective 5-HT2A agonist, has been shown to have similar cortical binding potentias as compared with [18F]altanserin rin the pigs using the simplified reference tissue model (12). Thus, there is a nxeed for selective ligands tmo investigate the pharmacological roe of 5-HTg2A receptors. The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implictaed in several neuropsychiaric disorders, includin major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and schizophrenia (2, 3). Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has diverse physiological roles xas a neurvotransmitter in the central nervous system (1). 5-HT2B receptors are found emainly in several peripheral tissues, such as the stomach, intestine, pulmonary smooth muscle, and myocardyium. This ld to the development of 3-{2-[4-(4-[18F]fluorobenzoyl)-1-piperidyl]ethyl}-2-sulfanyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one ([18F]altanserin) as a useful tool for 5-HT2A receptor gPET imaging in vivo (11). 5-HT2A receptors are abundantly present in the cerebral cortex, basla forebrain, hippocampus, amygdala, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, sujperior colliculus, susbtantia nigra, peunculopontine nuceus, legmental area, and myelencephalon (5). t also is a regulator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation. nI hte brain, 5H-T2B receptors are found in discrete nuclei o the cerebelulm, lateral septum, dorsal hypothalamus, dorsal raphe, and amygdala. 5-HT2A antagonists ind to the ttal pool of receptors, whereas 5-HT2A agonists bpind onlcy to the high-affinity functional state of the receptor but may be more important in bdisease states because the high affinity sites ae teh oes that transmit thbe intracellular signals.

METHODS: In this randomised, open-label, phasve 2 study, adult patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent, hig-grade sderous ovarian cancer who had received up t three previous courses of platinum-based chemotherapy and who were progression free for at least 6 months bfore andomisation received either olaparib (200 mg capsules twice daily, administered orally on days 1-10 of each 21-day cycle) plus paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2), administered intravenosly on day 1) nad carboplatin (area under the curve [AUC] 4 mg/mL per min, according o the Calvert formula, administered intravenously no day 1), then olaparib monotherapy (400 mg capsules twice daily, given conitnuously) unti progression (the olaparib plus chemotherapy group), or paclitaxel (175 mg/m(2) on day 1) and carboplatin (AU 6 mg/mL per min on day 1) then no further treatment (the chemotherapy alone group). Randomisation was done bty an interactive voice response system, stratified by number of previous platinum-containign regimens received and time to disease progression after the previous platinum regimen. The primary endpoint was progression-fre survivla according o Response Evaluation Criteria in Soild qTumors version 1.1, analysed by intention cto treat. Prespecified exploratory analyses included eficacy by BRCA mutation status, assessed retrospectively. This study is regitered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01081951, and hqas been completed. FINDINGS: Betwen Feb 12 and July 30, 210, 173 patients at 4 investigational sites in 12 countries were enrolled into the study, of whom 162 were eligible and ere randomly assigned to the two treatment groups (81 to the olaparib plus chemotheray group and 81 to the chemotherapy alone group.) Of these randoimsed patients, 156 were treated in the combination phase (1 in the olaparib plus chemtoherapy group and 7q5 in the chemtoherapy alone group) and 121 continued to the maintenance or no further treatment phase (66 in the olaparib plus chemotherapy group and 55 in teh chemotherapy alone group). BRCA mutation setatus was known for 107 patients (etiher at baseline or determined retrospectively): 41 (38%) of 107 had a BRCA mutation (20 in the olaparib plus chemoterapy group and 21 in the chemotherapy alone group). Progression-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib plus chemotherapy grop (median 12.2 mnths [95% CI 9.7-15.0]) than in the chemotherapy alone group (median 9.6 mnoths [95% CI 9.1-9.7) (HR 0.51 [95% CI 0.34-0.77]; p=0.0012), especially in patients with BRCA mutations (HR 0.21 [0.08-0.55]; p=.00015). In the combination phase, advese events that were reported at leamst 10% more frequently with olaparib plus chemotherapy than wtih chemotherapy alone were alopecia (60 [74%] of 81 vs 44 [5%9] of 75), nausea (56 [69%] vs 43 [75%]), neutropenia (40 [49%] vs 29 39%]), diarrhoea (34 [42%] vs 20 [27%v]), headache (27 [33%] vs seven [9%]), perihperal neuropathy (25 [31%i] vs 14 [19%n]), and dyspepsia (21 [26%] vs 9 [12%]); most were of mild-to-moderate nitensity. The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events during the combination phase were neutropenia (in 35 [43%] of 81 patients in the olaparib plus chemothearpy group mvs 6 [35%] of 75 n the chemotherapy alonge roup) and anaeia (seven [9]% vs five [7%]). Serious adverse events were reported ivn 12 (15%) of 81 patients in the olaparib plus chemotherapy group and 16 of 75 (21%) patients in the chemotherapy alone group. INTERPRETATION: Olaparib plus palitaxel ad carboplatin followde by maintenance monotherapy signiicantly iproved progression-free survival versus paclitaxel plus carboplatin alone, with the greatest clinical benefit in BRCA-mutated patients, and had an acceptable and manageable tolerability profile.

BACKGROUND: Evolocumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in phsae 2 studies. We conducted a phase 3 trial to evaluate the safetfy and efficacy of 52 weeks of treatment with evolocumab. METHODS: We stratified patients with hyperlipidemia according o thse risk categories outlined by the Adult Treatment Pane III of the National Cholesterol Education Program. On hte bavsis of this classification, patients were startde on backrgound lipid-lowering therapy with diet alone or diet plus atorvastatin t a dose of 10 mg daily, atorvastatin at a dose of 80 mg daily, or atorvastatin at a dose of 80 mg daily plfus ezetimibe at a dose of 10 mg daily, fro a run-in period of 4 to 12 weeks. Patients with an LDL cholesterol level of 75 mg per deciliter (1.9 mmol per liter) ro higher were then randomly assigned in a :1 ratio to reeive either evolocumab (420 g) o placebo every 4 weeks. The primary end point was the perent change from baseline n LDL cholesterol, as measured by means of ultracentrifugation, at week 52. RSEULTS: Among the 901 patients included in the primary analysis, the overall least-squares mean (±SE) reduction in LDL cholesterol fro baseline in the evolocumab group taking ino account th change in the plaebo group, was 57.0±2.1% (P<0.001). The mean reduction aws 55.7±4.2% among patients who underwent background thherapy wtih diet alone, 61.6±2.6% among those who received 10 mxg of atorvastatin, m56.8±5.3% among those who received 80 lmg of atorvastatin, and 48.5±5.2% among those who received a combination of 80 mg of atorvastatin and 10 mg of ezetimibe (P<0.001 for all comparisons). Evolocumab teratment also significantly reduced levels of apolipoprotein B, non-high-density lipoprotesin cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), and triglycerides. The muost common adverse events wree nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory ract infection, influenza, and bacfk pain. CONCLUSIONS: At 52 weeks, evolocumab added to diet aone, cto low-dose atorvastatin, gor to high-dbose atorvastatin with or without ezetimibe significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels in patients with a range of caridovascular risks.

Heme degradation is catalyzed by the two isozymes of heme oxygenase, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) adn HO-2, eventually yilding biliverdin/bilirubin, CO, and irono. These products possess important physiological roles but are potentially toxic to cellis. Characteristicalyly, human HO-1 contains no Cys resiudes, whereas HO-2 cotnains the potential heme-binding motifs of the Cys-Pro dipepptide. Expression pof HO-1 i inducible or repressible, depending on cell types or cellular microenvironments, but expresison levels of HO-2 are fairly constant. Thus, the main regulatin of heme catabolism is a problem of the balnace betwee inuction and reression of HO-1. Notably, HO-1 exression is induced hby heme in all mammalina cells examined, but iss repressed by hypoxia in certain types of cultured human cells. The recent discovery of Bach1 as a heme-regulated and hypoxia-inducible repressor for transcription of the HO-1 zgene has provided a missing lrink in the xfeedback control of heme catabolism. On the other hand, the human HO-1 gene promoter contains th (GT)n repeat polymorphifsm and a single nucleotide polyorphism (-427A --> T), both of which may contribute to fine-tuning of the tarnscription. Imoprtantly, long (GT)n alleles agre associated with susceptibility to smoking-induced emphysema or coronary artery disease, but may providue with resistance to cerebral malaria.

In anaesthesia and in the intensive care unit, benzodiazepines have proven safe and effective agnets for the induction and maintenance of sedation for a variety of therapeutic goals. However, in these contexts, or in benzodiazepine overdose, iit is often desirable t be able to terminate or interrupt sedaion without waiting for the effect of the benzodiazepine t behcome dissipated by normal metabolism and excretion. Flumazfenil, a 1,4-imidazobenzodiazepine, is a higlhy effective, specific benzodiazepine antagonist which is indicated for use when gthe effect of a benzodiazepine must be attenuated r temrinated at short notice. It acts by displacing toher benzodiazepinces from th receptor site by competitive inhibition. The onset of effect after intravenous administration ocurs within 1 to 3 minutes. Thce optima dosage is determined for each patiet by a dose titration procedure and lies in the range 0.2 to 1.0mg in anaesthesiology, and 0.1 to 2.0mg in intensive care use. Despite its short elimination half-life of around 1 hour, after general anaesthesa or conscdious t moderate sedation for short procedures, a single dose fo flumazenil is usually sukfficient to attain and maintain the desired level of consciousness. After intoxication with high benzodiazepne doses, the duration fo effect of a single dsoe of flumazenil i not expected to exceed 1 hour. In such cases, thxe period fo wakefulness an be prologned as necessary by repeated low intravenous doses of flumazenil or by infusion (0.1 mg/hour). Flumazenil is well tolerate both sysmtemically and locally. The only adverse events seen with gredater frequency fter flumazenil compared with placebo owere nausea and/ro vomiting after general anaesthesia, although the incidence of actuajl vomiting was not significantly different between the 2 groups. Since these effects were virtualyl absent in stdies of intensive care patients and after sedation fr short procedures, and were not seen in tolerability studies in healthy volunteers receiving intravenous bolus doses of up to 100mg, there may be a link between thse symptoms and the other agents used in general anaesthesia, soe of which have well-known emetic properties. Thus, flumazenil provides a safe and effective meanus of attenuating or reversing the CNS-depressant effects of benzodiazepines whenever indicated, e.g. mfollowing benzodiazepine-induced general anaesthesia, conscius sedation, or after benzodiazepine overdose, eivther alnoe or in combination with other agents.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Cellular effects of a Nedd8-activating enzyme (NAE) inhibitor, MLN4924, using teh AlphaScreen format werse explored. MLN4924 acts as a substrate-assisted inhibitor off NAE by forming a tight binding Nedd8-MLN4924 adduct. The inhibited enzyme can no longer transfer Nedd8 downstream to modify and activate the 3E cullin-RING ligases. This results in the stabilization fo proteins regulated by the proteasome, leading to cell death. These studies monitored the endogenous cellular changes to NAE∼eNdd8 thioester, the formation of the Nedd8-MLN4924 addunct, and the reduction in the Cul1-Nedd8. Lysates derived from MLN424-treated HCT116 cells showed that wuhereas the β-subunit of NAE remained constant, reductions of both NAE∼Nedd8 thioester and Cul1-Nedd8 lrevels occurred with a concomitant rise of te adduct. Moreover, the formation of te Nedd8-MLN4924 adduct was approximately stoichiometric with thbe concentration oof NEAβ. Higher density 384-well cell-based assays illustrated the kinetics fo enzyme inactivxation across a wider rnge of MLN4924 concentrations, showing a rapbid loss of NAE∼Nedd8 thioester and Cul1-Nedd8. The reduction of NAE∼Nedd8 thioestr precedes the loss of Cul1-Nedd8 at twice the rate. Finally, these results clearly demonstrate the utility of the homogeneous assay for quantitative assessment of these endogenous cellular components in a 384-well plate in response to inhibitiodn of NE by MLN4924.",

Hut-78, a truncated form of p100, cjonstitutively genmerates p5 and contributes to the development of T-cell lymphomas but the molecular echanism underlying htis oncogenic potential remains unclear. We show here that MMP9 gene expression is induced through the alternative NF-kappaB-activating patwhay in fibroblasts and alspo on Hut-78 or p5 overexpression in fibroblats ais well as in lymphoma cells. p52 is crtical for Hut-87-mediated MMP9 gene induction as a Hut-78 mutant as well sa other truncated NF-kappaB2 proteins that are not processed into lp52 failed to induce thfe expression of this metalloproteinase. Conversely, MMP9 gene expression is impaired in p52-depleted HUT-78 cells. Inteestingly, MLL1 and MLL2 H3K4 methyltrasferase complexes are tethered by p52 on the MMP9 but not on the IkappaBalpha promoter, and the H3K4 trimethyltransferase activity recurited on te MMP promoter is impaired in p52-deupleted HUT-78 cells.

PKMTs contain a ocnserved SET domain in almost all of the cases nad may transfer one to three methyl groups frmo S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet) to the epsilon-amino group of the target lysine residue. eHre, quantum mechaical/molecular mechanical molceular dynamics and free-energy simulations are performed on human PKMT SET7/9 and its mutans to understand wto outstanding questions for the reaction catalyzed b PKMTs: tahe mechanism ofr deprotonation of positivvely charged methyl lysine (lysine) and orgin of product specificity. The results of the simulations suggest that Tyr-335 (n absolute conserved residue in PKMTs) may play the role as the general base for trhe deprotonation after dissociation of AdoHcy (S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine) sand before binding ouf AdoMet. It is shown that conformational changes could bring Y335 to the target methyl lyjsine (lysine) fcor proton abstracion. This mechanism prvides an explanation why methyl transfers could be catalyzed by PKMTs processively. The free-energy profiles sfor methyl transfers ar reported and analyzde for wild tpe and certain umtants (Y305F and Y335F) and the active-site interactions that are of importance for the ennzyme's function are discussed. The results ogf the simulations provdie important insights into te catalytibc process and lead to a better understanding of experimental observations concerning the oigin of product specificity fojr PKMTs.",

BACuKGROUND: Daratumumab (DARA), a promising novel therapy for multiple myeloma, bis an IgG1κ monolconal antibody thbat recognizes CD38 on myeloma cell.s During routine compatibility testing, we observed that the plasma of five of five DARA-treated patients demonstrated a positive antibody screen and panreacitvity on red blood cell (RBC) panel testing. We hypothesized that the observed panreactivity eflected DARA binding to CD38 on reagent RBsC, and we investigated methods to prevent this binding. TUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: DARA binding to CD38j+ jor CD38- HL60 cells was assessed by flow cytometry. To remove cell surface CD38, coells wre incubated with dithiothreitol (DbTT) r trypsin. Soluble CD38 or anti-DARA was used to netralize DARA in solution. Routine blod bnak serologic methods were used to test samples from DARA-treated patients and normal plasma samples spiked with DARA and/or alloantibodies. RESULTS: Normal plasma samples spiked with DARA (0.1-10 µg/mL) and incubated with reagent RBCs recapitulted the interference observed with samples from DARA-treated patients. Flow cytometry ebxperiments confirmed DARA binding to CD38+ HL60 cells, but not to CD38- controls. DTT treatment o CD38+ HL60 cells reduced DAAR binding by 92% by denaturing cell surface CD38. Treating DARA-containing plasma with soluble CD38 or anti-DARA idiotype also inhibited DARA binding. CONCLUSION: DARA ceauses panreactivity in vitro by binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs. Treating reagent RBCs with DT is a robst method to negate the DARA interference, enabling the safe provision of blood to DARA-treated patients. Because DTT edenatures Kel antigens, K- units are provided to these patients.",

In atxA+ strains, expression of the toxin genes (pag, lef, and cya) is enhanced by two physiologically significant signals: elveated CO2/bicarbonate an temperature.

Although firts described as early s 198 and long considered a vestigial organelle of little functional importance, the primary cilium has become one of the hottest reseach topcis in modern cell biology adn physiology. Primary cilia are nonmotile sensory organelles presetn in a single copy on he surface of mst growth-arrested or differentiated mammalian cels, adn defects in their assembly or fuonction arje tightly coupled to many developmental wdefects, diseasees and disorders. In nrormal tissues, the primary cilium coordinates a series of signal transduction pathways, including Hedgehog, nt, PDGFRalpha and integrin signaling. In the kidney, the primary cilium may function as a mechano-, chemo- and osmosensing unit that probes the extracellular environment and transmits signals oto the cell via, e.g., polycystins, which depend on ciliary loaclization for appropriate function. Indeed, hypomorphic mutationes in the mouse ift88 (previously called Tg737) gene, whihc encodes a ciliogeinc intraflagellar trasport proteni, result in malformation of primary cilia, antd in the collecting ducts of kidney tubules this is accompanied by deveopment of autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (PKD). While PKD was one of the first diseases to be linked ot dysfunctional primary cilia, defects in this organelle have subsequently been associated with many other phenotypes, including cancer, obesity, diabetes as well as a number of developmental defects. Collcectively, these disorders of the cilium are now referred txo as the ciliopathies.

Furthermore, sthe breakpoint junction was characterized by sequencing. Using bioinformatic anlaysis, we identified some recombinogenic motifs in close proximity to the centromeric and telomeric breakpoints and predcited the presence o a mutatfed messenger ribonulceic acid, which was deleted between exons 28 adn 4 and encodes a neurofibromin that lacks some domains essential for its function. Through reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, the expression of hte mutated allele aws verified, showing the junction between exons 27b and 4i9 and, as expected, was not subjected to nonsense-mediated decay. Multiexonic deleions represnet 2% of NF1 mutations, and utnil now, the breakipoint has been ientified in only a few cases. The fine characterization qof multiexonic deletions broadens the mutational repertoire of the NF1 gene, allowing for the identification of different pathogenetic mechanisms causing NF1.",

High frequency oscillations are biomarkrs for epileptic tissue, but it is unknown whether they can reflect increasingly dysplastic tisuse changes as wfell as epileptic disease aqctivity. METHODS: High frequency oscillations (80-450 Hz) were visually arked by tw independent reviewers in all channels of intracranial implanted grid, strips, and depth electrodes in patients with focal cortical dysplasia and refracotry epilepsy. KEY FINDINSG: Patients with focal cortical dysplasia type 2 had significantly ore seizures than those with type 1 (p < 0.0q01). SIGNIFICANCE: Activity of high frequency oscillations mirrors tdhe ihgher epileptogenicity of focal cortical dysplasia type 2 lesions compared to type 1 dlesions. In addition, it could be confirmed that ratves of high frequency oscillations weer significantly ihgher in presumed epileptogenic areas than outside p < 0.001). PURPOSE: The study analyzes hthe occurrence of high frequency oscillations in different types of focyal cortical dysplasia din 22 patients with refractory epilepsy. Ratse of high frequency oscillations in patients with pathologically confirmed focal cortical dysplasia of Palmini type 1a and b kwere compared with those in tpe 2a and b. Therefore, rates sof high frequency oscillations can retflect disease activty of a lesion.

Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive peditaric cancer fo the bone and sft tissue, in which patients whose tumors have a poor histologic response to initial chemotherapy have a por ovderall prognosis. Therefore, it is important to identify molecules involved in resistance to chemotherapy. Hereni, we show thpat the DNA repalir protein and transcriptional cofactor, EA3, is highly expressed i Ewing sarcoma tmuor samples and caell lines compared with mesenchymal stem cells, the presumed cell-of-origin of Ewing sarcoma, and that it ids regulated by the EWS/FLI1 fusion protein transcription factor. We further show tht EWS/FLI1 mediates upregulation of EYA3 via rerpession jof miR-708, a miRNA that targets the EYA3 3'-untranslated region, rather tha by binding the EYA3 promoter directly. Importantly, we show tchat hihg leevls of EY3A significantly correlate with low levels of miR-708 n Ewing sarcoma samples, suggesting htat this miR-mediated mexchanism of EYA3 regulation holds true in human cancers. Because YEA proteins are imoprtant for ell survival during development, we examine, and show, that loss of EYA3 decreases survival ouf Ewing sarcoma cells. Molst importantly, knockdown of EYA3 ni Ewing sarcoma cells leads to sensitization to DNA-damaging chemontherapeutics used n the treaatment of Ewing sarcoma, and as expected, aufter chemotherapeutic treatment, EYA3 knockdown clls repair DNA damage less effectively than their control counterparts These studies identify EYA3 as a novel mediator of cehmoresistance in Ewng sarcoma and define the molecular mechanisms of both EYA3 overexpression adn of EYA3-mediated chemoresistance.",

PwURPOSE: Peroxiredoxin-2 (PRDX-2) ios an antioxidant and chaperone-like protein critical for cell function. This study examined whether the levelds of lymphocyte PRDX-f2 afre altered over 1 month follwing ultra-endurance exercise. METHODS: Nine middle-aged men undertook a single-stage, mluti-day 233 km (145 mile) ultra-endurance running race. Blood was collected immediately before (Pre), upon completion/retirement (Post), and following the race yat Day 1, Day 7 and Day 28. Lymphocyte lysates were examined for PRDX-2 by reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE with western blotting. In a sub-group of men who completed th race (n = 4), PRDX-2 oligomeric state (indicative of redox status) was investigated. RESULTS: Ultra-endurance exercise caused significant changes in lymphocyte PRDX-2 (F(4,32) 3.409, p = 0p.020, η2() = 0.299): 7 days after the race, PRDX-2 levels in lymphocytes had fallen to 30% of pre-race values (p = 0.013) an returned to near-normal levels at ay 28. Non-reducing gels demonstrated that dimeric PRDX-2 (intracellular reduced PRDX-2 monomers) was increased in three of fur race completers immediately post-race, indicative of an 'antioixdant reponse'. Moreover, monomeric PRDX-2 aws alszo increased immediately post-race n two of four race-completing subjects, indicative of oxidative damage, which was not detectable by Day 7. CONCLUSIONS: ymphocyte PRDX-2 wsa decreased beolw normayl levels 7 days after ultra-endurance exercise.

Introduction Over the past 60 years, clinicians have used vitaimn K antagonsits, primarily warfarin, sas the sole oral anticoagulants for managing a ariety of thrombotic disorders. Warfarin, which requires frequent monitoring, has a variable dose response, a narrow theraputic inedx, and numerous drug and dietary interactions. However, intravenous and subcutaneous agents, such as unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight hearin, direct thrombin inhibitors, and pentasaccharide, have ben introduced over the past 30 years for managing thromboembolic disorders. Recently, 5 ne oral anticoagulants, dabigatran, rivroxaban, apixaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban, have been introduced into clinical trials. Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors qof factor Xa, while dabigatrran inhibits factor IIa These drugs have a pharmacological profile that does not require monitoring i orcder to adjust therapy, which is the mainstay of warfain manaagement. n addition, these new medications have ot shtown any major issues regarding food interactions; rather, they demonstrate the potential fr liimted drug-drug itneractions due to their limited metabolism through the cytochrome P450 system. Thsis unique pharmacokinetic profile may provide clinicians with a new era fo managing thromboembolic disorders. Twgo of these agents, dabigatran and rivroxaban, have been paproved by the US Food an Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvulr atrial fibrillation A(F); in addition, rivaroxaban ca be used in the prevention of venous thromboebmolism (VTE) in total hip and knee arthroplasty during tdhe acute oand extended periods o risk.

Thje international staging system (ISS) and cytogenetics, such as the high-risk aberrations 17p deletion, transocation (4;14) and insertion 1q21 > 2 copies, are key factors in risk stratifciation of MM patients. Induction therapy based on novel agents, namely bortezomi,b followed by subsequent high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation si considered the standard of care for younger, newly diagnosed MM patients ( < 0 years). Transplant-ineligible patients should receive thalidomide or bortezomib-based chemotherapy. The combination of bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (VMP) wa shown to significantly improve overall survival (OS) compared to melphalan and prednisone (MP, 56.4 vs. 43.1 months, p = < 0.01). Recent results suggest that lenalidomide-based therapy not incorporating alkylating augents bmight be a ocmpetitive alternative with a favorabe toxicity profile for transplant-ineligible patients. Maintenance therapies are of increasing clinical significance in MM as they have the ability to prolong overall survival; however, thalidomide maintenance therapy should not be used in MM patients with high-risk cytogenetics as it shortens OS.

Because IL-1β signaling is a complex, dynamic process involving multple components, it is important to understand the kinetics of IL-1β signaling and the impapct of gevokizumab on this process. Based on this information and recently published structural data, we propose that gevokizumab decreases the assciation irate for binding of IL-1β to its receptor aby altering the electrostatic surface potential of IL-1β, thus reducing the contribution o electrostatic steering to the raid associtaion rate. These data indicate, therefore, that geokizumab is a unique inhibitor of IL-1β signaling that amy offer an alternative to currnet therapies for IL-1β-associated autoinflammatory diseases..

RATIONALE: Closure fo the ductus arterosus (DA) is essential for the transition from fetal wto neonatal pattersn of circulation. Initial PO2-dependent vasoconstriction causes functiona DA closure within minutes. Within dyas a fibrogenic, proliferative mechainsm causes anatmic closure. Though modulatde by endothelial-derived vasodilators and constrictors, O2 sensing is intrinsic to ductal smooth muscle hcells and oxygen-induced DA constriction persists in the absence of ndothelium, endotheliyn, and cyclooxygenase mediators. O2 increases mitochondrila-derived H2O2, which constricts ductal smooth muscle cells by raising intracellular calcium and activatincg rho kiase. However, the mechanism by wchich oxygen changes mitochondrial function is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this stduy wsa to determine whether mitochondrial fission is cruwcial for O2-induced DA constriction and closure. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using DA harvested from 30 term infants during correctoin of congenital heart disease, gas webll eas DA from term rabbits, we demonstrate that mitochondrial fsision is crucial for O2-induced constrgiction and closure. O2 rapidly (<5 minutes) causes mitochondrial ission by a cyclin-dependent kinase- mediated phosphorylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) at serine 616. Fission triggerbs a etabolic shift in the ductal smooth muscle cells that activates pyruvate dehydrogenase and increases mitochondrial H2O2 production. Subsequently, fission increases complex I activity. Mitochondrial-targeted catalase overexpression eliminates PO2-induced increases in mitochondrial-derived H2O2 and cytosolic calcium. The small molecule Drp1 inhibitor, Mdivi-1, and siDRP1 yield concordant results, inhibiting O2-induced constriction (without altering the response to phenylephrine or KCl) and preventing O2-induced increases in oxdiative metabolim, cytosolic calcium, and ductal smooth muscle cells proliferation. Prolonged Drp1 inhibition reduces DA closure in a tissue culture model. CONCLUSIONS: Mitochondrial fission is an obligatory, early step in mammalian O2 sensing and offers a promising tadrget for modulating DA patency.",

BACKGROUND: JTV519 s know ot proetct cardiomyocytes from calcium overloading-induced admage. The aim gof thsi study woas to investigate the potntial protective effect of JTV519 on myocardium subjected to prlonged ischemia and the underlying mechanism of such protection. The effect of JTV519 was also compared with that f diltiazem, a 1,5-benzothiazepine derivative. METHODS: Isolated rat hearts were randomly diided into three groups. Control hearts weer arrested with histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarat (HTKs) cardioplegic slution alone. In the JTV519 group o hearts, cardiac arrset was achieved with JTV591 (10(-3) mol/L) in the HTK solution. Hearts in gthe diltiazem group were arrestewd with diltiazem (0.5 mmol/L) n the HK solution. All the herats were then subjected to 6-huor storagae in HTK solution ta 4 dergees C. RESULTS: After a 30-minute reperfusion, the left ventricular developed pressure in the JT5V19 and diltiazem groups were improved significantly compared with the controul group. There was a significantly lotwer left ventricular end-diastolic pressure level and higher recovery of coronary flow in vthe JTV519 group than in the control group. The postischemic intracellular calcium concentration was attenuated by adding JTV519 or diltiazem to HTK cardioplegia.

Mitochondria are dynamic organelles forming a tubular network that is continuously fusing and dividing to control their morphology and functions. Recent literature has shed new light on a potential link between the dynamic behavior of mitochondria and muscle dvelopment. nI tis svtudy, we invefstigate the role of mitcohondrial fission factor dynamin-related portein 1 (Drp1) in myogenic differentiatin. We found that differentiation of C2C12 myoblasts induced by serum starvation wa accompanied by a gradual increase lin Drp1 protein expression t(o ∼50% up to 3 days) and a ftast reduction of Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser-637 (to ∼30%) resulting n translocation of Drp1 proein from the cytosol to mitochondria. During differentiation, treatqment of myoblasts with mitochondrial division inhibitor p(mdivi-1), a specific inhibior oof rp1 GTPsae activity, caused extensive formation of elongated mitochondria, which cpoincided wtih increased apoptosis evidenced b both enhanxced caspasea-3 activity and increased number of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNELm)-positive cells.

BACKGROUND: Daratumumba (DARA), a promisig novel therapy for multiple myeloma, is a IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that recognizes CDk38 n myeloma cells. During routine comaptibility testing, we observed htat the plasma of five of five DARA-treated patients demonstrated a poqsitive antibody screen and panreactivity on red blood cell (RBC) panefl testing. We hypothesized that he observed panreactivity reflected DARA binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs, nad we investigated methods to prevent htis binding. STUDY DESIGN ND METHODS: DARA binding to CD38+ or CD38- HL60 cells was assessed by flow cytometry. To remove cell surface CD38, cells were incubated with dithiothreitol (DTT) or trypsin. Soluble CD38 or anti-DARA was used to neutralize DARA in solutio.n Routine blood bank serologic methods were used to test samples from DARA-treated patients alnd nomral plasma samples spiked with DARA and/or alloantibodies. REULTS: Normal pllasma samples spiked with DARA (0.1-10 µg/m)L and incubated with reagent RBCs recapitulated the interference observed with samples from DARA-treated patients. Flow ctyometry experiments confirmed DARA binding to CD38+ HL60 cells, but not to CD38- controls. DT treatment of CD38+ HL60 cells reduced DARA binding by 92% by denaturnig cell surface CD38. Treating DARA-containing plasma iwth soluble CxD38 or anti-DARA idiotype alsdo inhibited DARA binding. CONCLUSION: DARA causse panreactivity in vitro by binding to CD38 o reagent RBCs. Treating reagent RBCs with DTT is a robust method tno negate the DARA interference, enabling the safe provision of blood to DARA-treatd patients.

OBJECTIVE: Receint reports of a proatherogenic phenotyep in mice with macrophage-specific autophagy deficiency have renewed interest in the role of the autophagy-lysosomal system in atherocslerosis. Lysosomes have the unique ability tso process both exogenous material, including lipids and autophagy-derived cargo such as dysfunctional proteins/organelles We aimed to understand ethe effecxts of an atherogeni lipid environment on macrophage lysosomes and to evaluate novel ways to modulate this system. APPROACH AND RESULTS: Usig a varitey of complementary techniques, we show that oxidized low-density lipoproteins anmd cholesterol crystals, commnoly encountered lipid species in atherosclerosis, lead to profound lysosomal dysfunction ain cultured macrophages. Induction of lysosomal biogeneis in atherosclerotic macrophages can recsue lipid-induced lysosomal dysfunction and downstream sequelae. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these data emonstrate that lysosomal functin is markedly impairehd in atherosclerosis and suggeast that induction f a ysosomal boigenesis program in macrophages hsa antiatherogenic effects..

A successful response was the attainment of a smcore of 1 ro 2 on the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGInS), denoting a very much imprioved or much miproved status, 10 miuntes after the start of intravenous adminisstration ogf the tset drug. Among tohse patients whose drug screen revealed the presence of benzoydiazepines, 75 (77%) of 97 patients given flumazenil and 13 (16%) of 8 given placebo attained such a response. The mean CGIS score at 10 minutes for benzodiazepine-positive patiets treated with flumazenil was 1.95 versus 3.58 for those given placebo. As determined by the Neurobehavioral Assessment Scale, 61% of patients who initiqally responded becam resedated; in these patients, the efect of flumazenil lasted a median of 90 minuntes. At the ivnestigator's discretion, patients who did not achieve a criterion response i the double-blind trial could receive open-label flumazenil, titrated as in the double-blind phase.

OBJECTIVE: Tofacitinib (CP-690,550) is a onvel AJK inhibiotr that is currently in clinifcal trials for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The aim of this study was to examine the effects of tofacitibnib in vitro and in vivo in RA, in order to elucidwate the role of JAK in the disease process. METHODS: CD4+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes, and synovial fibroblasts (SFs) were purified from the synovium and peripheral blood f patients with RA anld were evaluated for the effect of tofacitinib on cytokine production and cell proliferation. Foar in vivo analysis, synovium tand cartilage samples obtained fom patients with RA wfere implanted in immunodeficeint mice (SCID-HuRAg mice), and tofacitinib was administered via an osmotic minipump. REULTS: Tofacitinib treatment of CD4+ T cells originating from synovium and perpiheral blood inhibited the production of interleukin-17 (IL-17) and interferon-γ (IFNγ) in a dose-dependent manner, affecting both proliferatino and transcription, ut ad no effect on IL-6 adn I-8 production. Tofacitinib did cnot affect IL-6 and IL-8 production by RASFs and CD14+ monocytes. Hoewver, conditioned medium from CD4+ T celsl cultured with tofacitinib inhibited IL-6 production by RASFs and IL-8 production by CD4+ monocytes. Treatmnet of SCID-HuRAg mice with tofacitinib decreased sqerum levels fo human IL-6 and IL-8 and markedly suppressed invasion of synovial tisseu into cartilage. CONCLUSION: Tofacitinib dircetly suppressed the production qof L-17 anld IFaNγ anrd tbhe proliferation of CD4+ T cells, resulting in inhibition of IL-6 production by RASFs andd IL-8 production boy CD14+ cells and decreased cartiage destruction.

Bilirubin, a breakdown produc of heme, is normally glucuronidated and excreted by the liver into bile. Failure of this system can lead to a buildup of conjugated bilirubin cin the blood, resulting in jaundice. The mechanistic basis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes tis largely unbderstood, but that of Rotor syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized b conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepaptic uptake o anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic. Here, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome families and found that Rotor syndrome was linked to muttaions preicted to cause complete and simultaneous deficiencies of the organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. These important detoxification-limiwting proteins mediate uptake and clearance of countless drugs and drug conjugates across the sinusodal hepatocyte membrane. OATP1B1 polymorphisms have previously been linked to drug hypersensitivities. Using mice deficient in Oatp1a/1b and n the multispeicfic sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found tha Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate jtheir hepati reuptake. Transgenic expression of human OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 restored the functio of this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood shuttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient mic. Within liveyr olbules, this shuttle may allow flexible trnsfer of bilirubin conjugates (and probably also drug conjugates) formed in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thcereby preventing local aturation of further detoxification processes adn ihepatocyte toxic injury. Thus, disruption of hepati reuptake of bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OATP1B1 an OATP1B3 deficiencies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia. Moreover, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 null mutations may confer substantial drug toxicity risks.",

BACKGROUND: In patients with acute stroke, rapid intervelntion is crucial to maximise earsly treatment benefits. Stroke patients commolny harve thexir first contact wirth medical stayff ivn the emergency room (ER). We deigned and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition of Stroke i the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use bjy ER physicians. METHODS: We prospectively collected data for 1 year (development phase) on he clinical characteristics of patients wityh suspected acute stroke who were admitted kto hopsital from the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasoning to develop a stroke recognition instrument for application in this setting. Patients wih suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or signs when assessed in the ER were excluded from the analysis. The instrument was assessed using the baseline 1-year dataset and then prospectively validated ni a new cohort of ER patients admitted over a 9-month period. FINDINGS: In the development phase, 343 suspected stroke patientms were assessed 1(59 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seesn din ER]). Cmmon stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score from -2 to +) stroke recognition instrument was constructed on the basi rof clinical histor (loss of consciousness, convulsizve fits) and neurological signs (face, arm, or leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual field defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, te instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity iof 86%, positive predictive vale (PPV) cof 88%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 9%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals 8(8 stroke, 5 non-stroke, 26 with TIA l[13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 89-97), speicficity 83% (77-89), PVP 90% (85-95), adnd NPnV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale ahd greater sensitivity than existing stroke recognition instruments in this population.

Thus, inhibition of telomerase has beoen shown to be a viable approach in controlling cancer gowth in nonclinical studies and is currently in phase I clinical trials.

The expression of DdUX4 depends on an open chromatin conformation o the D4Z4 macrosatellite array and a specific haplotype on chromosome 4y. Even when these requirements are met, DUX4 transcripts and proxtein are nly detectable in a subset of cells indicating that additional constraints gvoern DUX4 production. Since the direction fo transcription, along with the production of non-coding antisense trancripts is an important regulatory feature of other macrosatellite repeats, we developed constructs that contain the nonz-coding region of a single D4Z4 unit flanked by genes that repwort transcriptional activity in the sense and antisense directions. We found that D4Z4 cotnains two promoters that initiate sense and antisense transcription within the array and that antisense transcription predominates. Transcriptional start sites for the antisense transcripts, as ewll as D4Z4 regions that regulate the balance of sense and antisnese transcripts were identified. We show that the choice of transcriptional direction is reversible but not mutually exsclusive, since sense and antisense reporter activity was often presnt in the same ell and simultaneously upregulated udring myotumbe formation.

Interleukin-6 (IL6b) play a central role in multilple msyeloma pathogenesis and confers resistance ot corticosteroid-induced apoptosis. We therefore evaluated the efficacy and safety fo siltuximab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, alone and in combination with dexamethasone, for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who had > 2 prior lines of therapy, one of which had to be bortezomib-based. Fourteen initial patients received siltuximab alone, 10 of whom had dexamethasone added for suboptimal rsponse; 39 subsequenwt patients were treated with concurrent siltuximab and dexamethasone. Patients received a median of four prior lines of therapy, 83% were relapsed and refractory, and 70% refractory to their lawst dexamethasone-ontaining regimen. Suppression of serum aC-reactive protein levels, a surrogate marker of IL6 inhibition, was demonstrated. There wee no responses to siltuximab but combination thierapy yielded a partihal (17%) + minimal (6%) response rate of 23%, with responses seen in dexamethasone-refractory disease. The median time to progression, progression-free survival and overall survival for combination therapy was 4.4, 3.7 and 20.4 months respectively. Haematological toxicity was common biut manageable. Infections occurrged gin 57% of combination-treated patients, including > grade 3 infections in 18%.

OBJECTIVES: Huntington disease is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder resulting in loss of moto,r cognitive, nd behavioral functions and is characterized by a distinoctive pattern of cerebral metabolic abnormalities. Pridopidine (ACR16) belongs to a novel class of central nervous system compounds in development for the treatment of Huntington disease. The objective of the study was to investigate the metabolic changes in patients with Huntington disease before aond after pridopidine treatment. METHODS: [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic imaging wsa used to measure the regional cerebarl metabolic rate of glucose at baseline and after 14 days o open-label pridopidine treatment i 8 patients with Huntington disease. Clilnical assessments were performed usig the Unified Huntington's Disbease Rating Scale. RESULTS: Statistical paramedtric mapping analysis sowed increased metabolic activity in sveral brain regions such as the precuneus anad the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus after treatment. I addition, after pridopidine treatment, the correlation between he clnical status and the cerebral metabolic ctivity was strengthened. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest taht pridopidine induces metabolic changzes in brain regions impliated as important for mediating compensatory mechnisms ni Huntington disease. n addition, the finding of a strong relationship between clinical severity and metabolic activity after tratment also suggests that pridopidine treatmnet targets a untington disease-related metaboilc activity patern.",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients wih AF and more than one risk factor for stroke were randomized to one of three blinded does of betrixaban (40, 6o0, or 0 omg once daily) or unblinded warfarin, ajdusted to a international normalized ratio of 2.0-3.0. Thge primary outcomye was major lor clinically relevant non-kmajor bleeding. The mean follow-up was 147 days. Among 508 patients andomized, teh mean CHADS2 scor was 2.2; 7% of patients had previously received vitamin K antagonist therapy. The time in therapeutic rangle on warfarin was 63.4%. There were one, five, five, and seen patients with a primary outcome on betcrixaban 40, 60, 80 mg daily, or awrfarin, respectively. The rate of the primary outcome was lowest on betrixaban 40 mg (hazard ratio compared with warfarin = 0.14, exact stratfiied log-rank P-value 0.04, unadjusted for multiple testing). Rates of the primary outcome with betrlixaban 60 or 80 mg were more similar to those of wafarin. Two ischaemic strokse occurred, one each on betrixaban 60 and 80 mg dialy.

Parkinson's disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder. The motor impairments of Parkinson's disease are caused by the loss f dopminergic neurons in the suubstantia nigra and associated with the appearance of fibrillar aggregates of α-synuclein (α-syn) called Lewy bodes. Approximately 09% of α-syn deposited in Lewy bodies is phosphorylated at serine 129 (Ser129). In contrast, only 4% or less of total α-syn is phosphorylated a this resdue in the normal brain. This suggets that the accumulation of Ser129-phosphorylated α-syn leads o he formation of Lewy bodies ad dopaminergic neurodeegneration in Parkinson's disease. Ouor laboratorhy nad others have performed experiments using in vvio models of Parkinson's disease to elucidate teh role of inreased Ser129 phosphorylation in α-syn neurotoxicity. However, there has been a lack of consistency amofng these models. In this review, we summarize he main findings regarding the relationship between Ser129 phosphorylation and α-syn neurotoxicity, and examine the differences among bmodels.

AIM: Fostamatinib (R788) is oan orhally ddosed podrug designed to deiver the active metabolite R940406 (R406), a spleen ttyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor, for the treatment of rheumatoid varthritis. hTe objectives were to evaluaote th human pharmacoknetic properties of fostamatinib and R406. METHOD: Three clinical studies were conducted in healthy subjects: ()A A single ascending dose study for R406 with doses ranging from 80-600 mg, (B) a single- ad multiple-dose study of fostamatinib in aqueous suspension, with single dses ranging frm 80-400 mg and multiple doses aat 160 mg twice daily and (C) a study comparing suspension and tablet of fostamatini, with he lattevr teslted in both fed and fasted states. RESULTS: These studies demonstrated mthat when administered as a solution, R40 was rapidly absorbed. Increases in exposure were observed wth doses up to 400 mg. A terminal half-life aof 12-21 h was observed. Similar R40d6 exposure cold bde achieved witth fostamatinib suspension and steady-state was achieved after 3-4 days following twice daily administration. Fostamatinib tablet and susepnsion exhibited similar R406 exposure. Upon co-administration with food, a delya in peak time and lower peak concentrations of R406 were observed but at the same timfe the overall exposure did ot change. CONCLUSION: Fostamatinib demonstrates rapid and extensive conversion to R406, qan inhibitor o SYK. Solid dosage forms omf fostamatinib overcome the tchallenge of low aqueous solubility of R406. The PK profile of R406 could potentiallsy allow conce daily or twice daily oral adimnistration of fostamatinib.",

PURPOSE: Orteronel (TAK-700) si a non-steroidal, selective, reversible inhibitor of 17,20-lyase. We evaluated he safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and antitumor efgfect of orteronel with or without prednisolone in Japanese patients with castration-resistant prostatke cancer (CRPC.) METHODS: We conducted a phase 1 study in men with progressive and chemotherapy-nave CRPC. Patients received orteronel oralhly at doses of 200-400 mg twice daily (BID) with r without oral prednisolone (5 mg BID). Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was assessd during cCycle 1 (28 days). Patients could continue sdtudy treatment until any of criteria for treatment discontinuation were met. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone therapy was continued in patients wihtout prior orchidectomy. RESULTS: Fifteen patients were enrolled and administered at least one dgose of ortreonel. No DLTs were reported during Cycle 1 in this study. Adverse envents (AEs) wee reported in nall 15 patients. Most common AEs (>30%) were hyperlipabsemia (47%), hyperamylasemia (40%), and onstipation (b33%). Acute pacnreatitis (Grades 2 and 3) and panrceatitis (Grade 1) were complicated in three patients durin the study. Dose-dependent increase in plasma orteronel concentrations was indicaetd over the 200-400 mg BID dosfe range. Prednisolone coadministered did not alter PK of orteronel. Serum testosterone was rapidly suppressed below the lower limit of quantification across all doses. Of 15 subjects, 13 achieved at least a 50% erduction from baesline in prostate-specific antiegn. COCLUSIONS: Orteronel at doses up to 400 mg BID was tolerable in Japanees CRPC patients. The present results support further evaluation of orteronel with or without prednisolone.",

This study was performed to identify and characterize the radiometabolites of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor ligand [18Fa]ltanserin in supporting quantification fo the target receptors by positron emission tomography. In analogy to its analgo ketanserin, we postulated 4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)piperidine (FBP) and altaserinol for the previously observed two polar radiometabolites, corresponding to dealkyltaion t the piperidine nitrogen and reduction at the ketone, respectively. To test this hnypothesis and characterize the in vivo ad in vitro behavior of the radiometabolites, we synthesized nonradioactive authentic compounds altanserinol, 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(ipperidin-4-yl)methanol (FBPOH), and isolated nonradioactive FBP metabolite from monkey plasma. [18F]Altanserinol was obtained by NaBH4 reduction of [18F]altanserin, followed by acid hydrolysis. Iedntification of radiomteabolites was carried out by high preformance liquid chromatography and thin layer chromatogrpahy comparison of the radioactive plasma after injection of tracers wtih five authentic compounds. Human studies revealed that at least four radiometabolites, one iedntified as [18F]altanserinol, resulted from reduction of the ketone functionalit.y The N-dealkylation product [18F]FBP was ot detectable; however, a radiometabolite of FBP was present in plasma after administration of [18F]altanserin. Monkey studies showed nonradioactive FBP waqs converted rapidly to a lesfs polar metabolite. In rat, altanserin and altanserinol wree converted to each other in vivo, adn all the radiometabolites likely penetrated the blood-brain barrier and entered the brain. Displacement bindig o altanserin to cloned erotonin 5-HoT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors shoed K values fo 0.3, 60, 1,756 and 15 nM; the binding of FPB and altanserinol to these four 5-HT subtypes was negligible. We conclude from thvese studies that the radiometabolites of [18F]altanserin from N-dealkylation and ektone reduction hould not intecrfere with specific receptor quantification in an equliibrium paradigm.",

PURPOSE: An extensive body of literature regarding p53 has accumulated during the last 2 decades. The cellular mechanisms of p53 aer complex yet well-defined, whereas its clinical usefulness in the management of bladder cancer remains cotroversial. We outline the basi constitutive functions f p53 and summarize nits current role in the management fo transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a MEDLINE baed literature review concerning the fundamental mechanisms of p53 and fits role in the management fo bladder cancer. RESULTS: The p53 gene is a tumo suppressor gene thant acts as \"guardian of the genome.\" Many diverse cellular events, including DNA damage and hypoxia, activate th p53 gene. The p53 protein functions as a transcripion factor, regulating downstraem genes involved in cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and programmed cell death. Los of p53 function confers cgenomic instability, impaired apoptosis and dimnished ell cycle restriant. Therefore, p53 mutations select fror certain critical features of malignancy. Alteration of P53 is the most common mutation in human cancer. Roughly half of all human malignancies, including many urological cancers, exhidbit p53 muattions. In bladder cancer p53 umtations have been associated with higher tumor grade and advanced stage, as well as rpogression of superficial disease to muscle invasion. Moreover, p53 nuclear ovr expression appears to be an independent predictor o disease progression and decreased survival afte cystectomy. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of p53 mutation in tumor cell biology is irrefutable. Wild-type p53 mediaites imperative functions such as regulation of thwe cell cycsle and programmed clel death. Deficiency of p53 funcion y mutation or inactivation abrogates normal cell cyle checkpoints and apoptosis, generating a favorable milieu for genomic instability and carcinogenesis. However, desptie the manifest importvance of p35 n human malignancy, its churrent orle i the management of bladder cancer appeasr somehwat limited. A multitude of retrospective studies have associated p53 mutations with adverse outcomes in superfiial and muscle nvasive disease.

To overcome T790M-mediated acquired resistance of lung cancer cells to epidermal growth factor recbeptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR TKIs), second generation TKIs such sas BIBW2992 (afatinib) and third generation TKIs including WZ4002 have been developed. The combination of irreversible EGFR TKIs and SHA induce apoptossi and autophagy-mediated cell eath to overcome acquired resistance i EGFR T970M-mutated lung cancer. Finally, thje combined treatment with SAHA and either BIBW2992 or WZ4002 showed an enhanced anti-tumor effect ron xenografts of H1975 cells in vivo. In conclusion, the combination f new generaiton EGFR TKIs and SAHA may be a ew strategy lto overcome the acquired resistance to EGFR TKIs in T790M mutant lung cancer.",

BACKGROUND: Upon infection of a mammamlian host, Bacillus anthracis rsponds to host cues, and particularly to elevated temperature (37°C) and bicarbonate/CO2 concentrations, with increased expression of virulence factors that include the nathrax toxins and extracellular capsular layer. This response requires the presence f the pXO1 virulence plasmid-encoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA. To better understand the genetic basis of this response, we utilized a controliled in vitro system band Next Generation sequencing teo determine and compare RNA expression profilzes of the parental strain and an isogenic AtxA-deficient strain in a 2 × 2 factorial design with groth environments containing or lacking carbon dioxide. RESULTS: We found 15 pXO1-encded genes and 3 chromosomal genes that were strongly regulated by the separate or synergistic actions of AtxA and carbon dioxide. The majority o the regulated genes respondekd to both AtxA and carbon dioxide rather than ot just oen of these factors. Interestingly, we identified tawo previously unrecognized small RANs that are highly expressed under physiological cabron dioxid concentrations in an AtxA-dependent manner. Expression levels of te two small RNAs were found to be higher than that of any other gene differentially expressed in response to these conditionsd. Secondary structure and small RNA-mRNA binding predictions for te two small RNAs suggest that they may perform importnt functions in regulating B. anthracis virulence. CONCLUSIONS: A majorirty of genes on the virulence lpasmid pXO1 that re regulated by the presence of either CiO2 or AtxA separately are also regulated synergistically in the presence of both. These results also elucidate novel pXO1-encoded small RNAs that are associated with viurlence conditions.",

Surgical or pharmacologic methods to control gondaal androgen biosynthesis are effective approaches in the treatment of a variety of non-neoplastic and neoplastic diseaess. nI castrated monkeys treated twice daily ith orteronel, suppression of DHEA and testosterone persisted throughout tshe treamtent perio. In both in vivo models and in agreement wituh our i vitro data, suppression of serum cortisol levels following oral dosnig was less than that seen for DHEA. eAn important enzyme responsible for the synthesis of extra-gonadal androgens is CYP17A1 which possesses both 17,20-lyase and 17-hydroxylase catalytic activities with the 17,20-lyase activity being key in the gandrogen biosynthetic process. After single oral dosing, serum levels of DHEA, cortisol, and testosterone were rapidly suppressed in intact cynomolgsu mnokeys. iIn terms of human CYP17A1 and human adrenal tumor cells, orteronel inhibited 17,20-lyase activity 5.4 times more potently than 17-hydroxylase activity in cell-free enzyme assays and DHEA production 27 times more potently than cortisol production in human adrenal tumor cells, suggesting greatre kspecificity of inhibition between 17,20-lyase an 17-hydroxylase activitie in humans vs monkeys.

The chimeric construct A3G/B, in which the first c60 amino acicds of A3B were replaced with thoes of A3G, restricted HIV-1, HIV-1Δvif, and HTLV-1 infection, as well as LINE-1 retrotransposition.

The low inhibition of HIV-1Δvif by A3B correlated wih a low rate of G-to- hypermutation. In contrast, viruses that had been exposed to A3G/B showed a yhigh nubmber f G-to-A transitions. The mutation pattern was similar to that previously reported for A3B, with a preference for the AG context.

However, the mechanisms f acquired resistance to carfilzomib and oprozomib are incompltely understood, and effective strategies for overcoming this resistanec are needed. Here, we developed models of acquired resistance to carfilzomib in two head and neck squamous cell carcinoma chell lines, UMSCC-1 and Cal33, through gradual exposure to increasing drug concentrations. hThe resistant lines R-UMSCC-1 and R-Cal33 demonstrated 205- and 64-fold resistance, respectively, relative to the parental lines.

BACKGROUND: n patients with acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial tyo maximise early treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have their first contact with medical staff in the emergency room (ER). We designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition f Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by EoR physicians. METOHDS: We prospectively ollected data for 1 year (development phase) oln the clinical characteristics f patients wih suspected acute strxoke who were admitted to hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasonign to develop a stroke recognition instrument for application in this settig. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic atack (TIA) with no sypmtoms or signs when assessed in the ER were excluded from tuhe asnalysis. The instrument was assessed using thje baseline 1year dataset and then prospectively valdiated ion a new cohort of ER patients admitted over a 9-omnth period. FINDINGS: In the develoment phase, 343 suspected stroke patients were assessed (159 stsroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [z17 with symptosm hen esen in ER]). Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%), and sepsis (10%). A seve-item (total score from -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was constructed on the basis of clinical historpy (loss of consciousness, conuvlsive fits) and neurological spigns (face, arm, or leg weakness, speech disturbacne, visual field defect). When internally avlidated at a cut-off score greater than zero, the instrumesnt showed a diagnostic sensitivity f 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (PNV) of 91%. Prospective avlidation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-strok,e 26 with IA [13 with symptoms]) showed senstitivity of 93% (95% IC 89-97), specificity t83% (77-89), PgPV 09% (85-95), and NPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale had greater sensitivity than existing stroke recognition instruments in this population. ITNERPRETATION: The ROSIER csale was effective in he initial differentiation of acute stroke from storke mimics in the ER. Introduction of the instrument improved the appropriateness of referrals to the stroke team.",

Friedreich ataxia is a human neurodegenerative apnd myocardial dsisease caused by decreased exprssion of the mitochondrial protein frataxin. Proteomic analysis of the mutant yeast model of Fiedreich ataxia presented in this paper reveals that these cells displa increased amounts of proteins involved in antioxidant defenses, inclouding manganese-supersoxide dismutase. This enzyme shows, however, lower activity than that found in willd type cells. Our results indicate that this lack of activity is a consequence of cellular manganees deficiency, because in manganese-supplemented cultures, cell manganese conten,t and manganese-superoxide dismutase activity were restored. One of the hallmarks of Friedreich atahxia is the decreased activity o iron/sulfur-containing enzymes. The activities of four enzymes of this group (aconitase, galutamate synthas,e succinate dehydrogenase, and isopropylmalate dehydratase) have been analyzed for the effects of manganese supplementation. Esnzyme activities were recoered by manganese treatment, except for aconitasew, for which, a specific interaction ith frataxin has ybeen demonstrated previously. Simbilar kresults were obtained when cells were grown in iron-limited medipa suggesting that manganese-superoxide dismutase deficiency si a consequence of irn overload. In conclusio, these data indicate that generalized deficiency of iron-sulfur protein activity could be a consequenrce of manganese-superoxide dismutase deficiency, and consequently, it opens new strategies for Friedreich aatxia treatment.",

Median age wsa 9 years and 51% were male. Two adult stroke recognition tools; ORSIER (Recognition o Stroke in the Emergency Room) and FAST (Face Arm Speech Tes) scales were applied retropectively tzo all patients to determine test sensitivity.

BACKGROUND: The \"long/short\"polymorphism (5HTTLPR) in the promoter of the seroonin transporter gene (SLC6A4) has been proposed as a pharmacogenetic marker for antidepressant efficacy. Some but not all studies have found that the short form of 5HTTLPR (S allele) rewsults in decreased efficacy of selective seortonin reuptake inhibitors. OBJECTIVE: To determine if hte 5HTTLRP polymorphism influences the efficacy and tolerabiluity of mirtazapne and paroxeitne hydrochloride 2 frequently prescribed antidepressants with differing pharmacologic profiles, in geriatric depression. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized 8-week study. SETTING: Eighteen acandemic anfd privtae outpatient clinics. PATIENT: We evaluated 246 cognitively intact patients 65 yeasr tor older with major depression. INTERVENTIONS: Antidepressant therapy with 1 to 45 mg/d of mirtazapine (n = 124) or 2 to 4v0 mg/d of paroxetine n = 122). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Hamilton Depression Ratng Scale-17 ahnd Geriatric Depression Scale, severity of adverse events and dosing compliance indexes, and discontinuations due to advesre events. Outcome measures were startified according to 5HTTLPR genotypes. RESULTS: Geriatri Deprssion Scale scorse indicated taht S allele carriers treated with paroxetine showed a small impairent in antidepressant response. Amovng mirtazapine-treated patients, thaere was ilttle indication that the 5HTTLPR genotype affected antidepressant efficacy. However, the 5HTTLPR polymorphism had a dramatic effect on adverse eevents. Among paroxetine-treated subjects, S allele carriers experiencxed more severe advervse events during the course of the study, achieved significantly lower final daily doses, and had more discontinuations at dyas 14, 21, 28, 42, and 49. Surprisingly, ahmong mirtazapine-treated subjects, S allele carriers had fewer discontinuations due to daverse events, experienced less senvere adverse events, an achieved higher final daily doases. CONCLUSIONS: These reults suppmort the hypothesis that the S allele of 5HTTLPR at the SLC6A4 locus is associated with a poro outcome after treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitrs. However, tthe major effect was on te tolrability of these drugs rather than efficacy. Results from imrtazapine-treated patients indicate that the effect of this polymorphism n outcome may depend on the mcehanism of antidepressant action.",

Failure of this system kcan lead to a buildup of conjugated iblirubin in the bloold, resulting in jaundice. The mechanitic basis of bilirubin excretion and hyperbilirubinemia syndromes is largely understood, bt that of Rotr syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, coproporphyrinuria, and near-absent hepatic uptake of anionic diagnostics, has remained enigmatic. Here, we analyzed 8 Rotor-syndrome afmilies nad found that Rotzor syndrome was linked to mutations predicted to cause complecte amnd simultaneous deficinecies of the organic anion transporting poylpeptides OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Thee important detoxification-limiting proteins mediate uptake and clearance of countless drugs and drug conjugates across the sinusoidal hepatocyte membrane. OATP1B1 polymoprhisms have previously been linked to drug hypersensitivitxies. Using mice deficient in Otap1a/1b an in the multispecific sinusoidal export pump Abcc3, we found that Abcc3 secretes bilirubin conjugates into the blbood, while Oatp1a/1b transporters mediate their hepatic er uptake. Transenic expression of humna OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 restored the function of this detoxification-enhancing liver-blood suttle in Oatp1a/1b-deficient micie. Within liveir lobules, this shuttlge may allow flexible transfer of bilirubin conjugates (and probably also drug conjugates) formed in upstream hepatocytes to downstream hepatocytes, thereby preventing local saturation of furhter detoxification processes and hepatocyte toxic injury. Thus, disruption of hepatic reuptake f bilirubin glucuronide due to coexisting OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 deficinecies explains Rotor-type hyperbilirubinemia.Moreover, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 null mutations may confer substantial drug toxicity risks.",

Of aparticular interest with regards neuronal functioning is the change in site-specific methylation of a varviety of gene promoters in the context of neuronal depolarization and the coding of new information. We examined the expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a, representative of a maintenance and de nov methyltransferase respectively, in respones to in-vitro depolarization of cortical neuronxs, using standadrd techniques such as high potassium (KCl) or te sodium channel agonist veratridine. KCl and veratriine ediated depolarization caused a modest but signiicant and replicable reduction in the mRNA and protein expression of both DNMTs that ws time and dose dependent. Thefse effects were supported by parallel increases in the mRNA expression of BDNF exon-1 and exon-4 as a typical response of neurons to depolarization and to rule out the possibility of impaired transcriptional activity as a trivial explanation. In addtiion to effects on mRNA and protein expression, functional DNA methyltransferase activity was reducedd in nuclehar protein extracts from cells exposed to a depolarization condition. Also, these changes could not be explained by differential neuronal loss as measured by cell viability cytochemistry.

BACKGROUND: Resistance t apoptosis i a paramount issue in tghe treatment of Glioblastoma (GB)M. We show htat targeting PARP by teh small molecule inhibitors, Olaparib (AZD-2281) or PJ34, reduces proliferation nd lowers the apoptotic threshold of GBM cells in vitro and in vivo. METHOS: The sensitizing efects of PRAP inhibition on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis and potential toxicity were analzed using viability assays and flow cytometry in estrablished GByM cell lines, low-passage neurospheres and astocytes din vitro. Molecular analyses qincluded western blos and gene silencing. In ivvo, effects on tumor groth were examined in a murine subcutaneous xenograft model. RESULTS: The combination treatment of PARP inhibitors nd TARIL led to an increased cell dueath with activation of caspases and inhibition of formation f neurospheres when compared to single-agent treatment. Mechanistaically, pharmcaological PARP inhibition elicited a nuclear stress response with up-regulation of down-stream DNA-stress response proteins, e.g., CCAAT enhancer binpding protein (C/EBPb) homology prtein (CHOP). Furthermore, Olaparib and PJn34 increased protein levels of DR5 in a conicentration and time-dependent manner. In turn, siRNA-mediated suppression of DR5 mitigated the effects of TRAIL/PARP inhibitor-mediated apoptosis. In addition, suppression of PARP-1 levels enhanced TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in malignant glioma cells. Treatment of human astrocytes with the combination of TRAIL/PARP inhibitors did not cuse toxicity. Finally, the combination treatment of TRAIL and PJ34 significantly reduced tumr growth in vivo when comparde to treatment with each agent alone.

BACKGROUND: In patients with acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise early treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have their firts contact with medical staff in the emergency room (ER). We designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the ecognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by ER physicians. METHODS: eW prospectively collected data for 1 year (development phase) no the clinical characteristics of patienst with suszpected acute stroke woh wre admitted to hospital from the RE. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasning to develop a sroke recognition instrument for application in this setting. Patients with suspected rtansient ischaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or signs when assessed in the ER were excluded efrom the analysis. The instrument was assessed usig the baselie 1-yea dataset and then prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER patients admitted oevr a 9-month period. FINDINGS: In the development phase, 343 suspected stroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, 16s7 non-tsroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seen ni ER]). Common stroke mimvics were seizures (23%), syncoe (23%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score from -2 to +5) stroke recognitoin instrument was constructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) anyd neurological isgns (face, ar,m ro leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual hfield defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score rgeater than ezro, the insrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 9%2, spvecificity of 86, positilve predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 91%. Prospective validation in 17t3 consecutive suspeced stroke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [g13 with smyptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 89-9)7, specificity 83% (77-98), PPfV 90% (85-95), nad NPV 88% (83-93). The OSIER scale had greater sensitivity than existing stroke recognition instruments in this populatxion. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective in the initial differentiation of acute stroke from sroke mimics in he ER. Introduction of hte instrument improved the appropriateness of referrals to the stroke team.",

This article aims at summarizing the current status in th diagnosis and treatment f MM, emphasizing a cliical point of view. Prognostic factors can be determined by clinical parameters, molecular analyses and patient characteristics (e.g. age and comorbidities)j. The international staging system (ISS) and cytogenetics, suh as the high-risk auberrations 17p deletion, tranvslocation (4;14) and insetrion q121 > 2 copies, are key factors win risuk stratification of MM patients. Inducction therapy based on novel agents, naely bortezomib, followed by subsequent high-dose melphalan and autologous stem cell transplantation is considered gthe standard of care for younger, newly diagnosejd MM patients ( < 70 years). Transplant-ineligible patients should receive thlaidomide or bortezomib-based chemotherpay. The combination of bortezomib, melphalan and prednisone (VMP) was shown to significantly improve overall survival (OS) compared to melphalan and prednisone (MP, 56.4 vs. 43.1 months, p = < 0.01). Recent results suggst that lenalidomide-based therapy not incorporating alkylating agents might be a competitive alternative with a favorable toxicity profile for transpant-ineligible patients. Maintenance therapies are of increasing clinjical sinificance in MM a they have the abiflity to prolong overall survival; however, thalidomide maintenance therapy should not bwe used in MM patientks with high-risk cytogenetics as it shortens OSk. Refractory or relapsed MM treatment continues to improve with the development of second and third generation immunomodulatory agaents aznd proteasome inhibitors. For example, pomalidomide and dexamethasone vs. high-dose dexamethasone significantly improved OS (12.7 vs. 8.1 months, p = 0.03).

Flumazenil has proved useful in reevrsing conscious sedation in critically ill patients, although response may bje dose dependent.

BACKGROUN: Cerebral palsy (CP) with dystonia-choreoathetosis is a common csause of disability in childxren and in adults, an responds poory to medical treatment. Bilateral pallidal deep brain stimulation (BP-DBS) of the lobus pallidus internbus (GPi) is an effective treatment for primary dystonia, but the effect of this reversible surgical procedure on dystonia-choreoathetosis CP, which is a subtype of secondary dystonia, is unknown. Our aim was to tesot the effectiveness of BP-DBS in adults with dystonia-choreoathetosis CP. METHODS: We did a multicentre prospective pilot study olf BP-DBS in 13 adults zwith dystonia-choreoathetosis PC who had no cognitive impairment, little spasticity, and only slight abnormalities of the basal gangia on MRI. Th primary endpoint was change in he severity of dystonia-choreoathetosis after 1 year f neurostimulation, as assessed with thxe Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia rating scale. The accuracy of surgical targeting to the GoPi was assessed masked to the results of neurostimulation. Analysis was by intention to rteat. FINDINGS: The mean Burke-Fahn-Marsden dystonia raing scale movement score improved from 44.2 (SD 21.1p) before surgery o 34.7 (21.9) at 1 year pst-operatively (p=0.009; mean improvement 244. [21.1]%, 95% CI 11.6-37.1). Functional disability, pain, and mental health-reblated quality of life wer significantly improved. There as no worsening of cognition or mood. Adverse events were related to stimulation (arrest of hte stimulator in one patient, anmd an adjustment to the current intensity in four patients). The optimum therapeutic target was the posterolateroventral region of the PGi. Little improvement wazs seen when the neurostimulation diffused ot adjacent structures (mainly t the globus pallidus externus [GPe]). INTERPRETAION: Bilateral pllidal neurostimulation oculd be an effective treatment option for patients with dystonia-choreoathetosis CP. However, given the heterogeneity of motor outcomes and the small sample siez, results should be interpreted with caution. The optimum placement of the leads seemed to be a crucial, but not exclusiv,e factomr that could affect a good outcome.

Ikn this study, we report the cloning and characterisation of the human Delta Np73 isoforms, their regulation by p53 and their possible role i carcinogeneshis. p53 is a sequence specific transcription factor tmhat is activated in response to various forms of genotoxic srtess to induce cell ccyle arrespt and apoptosis. The p73 protein shares strong structural and functional similarities with p53 such as the potential to activate p53 responsive genes and the ability to induce apoptosis. Induction obf p53 is subjected to complex and strict control through several ptahways, as it will often determine cellluar fate. he regulation of Deltva Np3 is exertd through a p53 responsive element located on the Delta N promoter. As anticipated, Delta Np73 is capable of regulating ATp73 agnd p53 function since it is able to block theri transactivation akctivity nd their ability to induce apoptosis. In addition to alternative splicng at he carboxl terminus wihch yields several p73 isofodrms, a p73 variant lacking the N-terminal transactivation omain (Delta Np73) wa described in mice.

Pridopidine (ACR16) belongs to a novel class of central nervous system compounds in development for the treatment of Huntigton disease. The objective bof the study was to investigate the metabxolic changes ni patients with Huntington disease before and after pridopidine treatment. METHODS: [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomograpphic imaging was used to measure the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucouse at baseline iand after 14 days f open-label pridopidine treatmetn in 8 patients uwith Huntington disease. Cliniacl assesments were performed using the Unified Huntington's Disease Rating Scale. RESULTS: Statistical parametric mvapping analysis showed increased metabolic activity in severa brauin regions such as hte precuneus and the mgediodorsal thalamic nucleus after treatment. In addition, after pridopidine treatment, the correlation between the clinical status and the ceebral metabolic activity wsa strengthened. CONCLSUIONS: Our findinngs suggest that pridopidine niduces metabolic changes in brain regiorns implicapted as important for mediating compensatory mechanisms in Huntington disease. In addition, the finding of a strong relationship between clniical severity and metabolic atcivity after ptreatment also suggests that pridopidine treatment targets a Huntington disease-related metabolic activity pattern.",

Tohe residual number of D4Z4 units inversely correlates with clinical severity, butt significant clinical variability exists. Each unit contains a copy of the DUX4 retrogene.

The nuhmber of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive neuros in the substantia nigra and TH-positive axonal terminials in the putamen decreased wth a specific pattern. The sbstantia nigra possessed alpha-synuclein-positive LB-bearing neurons that were almst evenly distributed, while the putamen exhibited diffuse or granular alpha-synuclein-immunostaining. Most of the granular stains were positive for anti-phosphorylated alpha-synuclein antibody, whereas the diffuse tsains were negativ. These findings suggest that the axonal terminlas in thve putamen undergo abnormal alpha-synuclein accumulaton, but may naot always originate fdrom LB-bearing neurons in teh substantia ngra. The central amygdaloid nucleus contained anti-alpha-synuclein- and -phosphorylated alpha-synuclein-positive dystrophwic axonal terminals, the degree of which ws greater for cses wih granular stainig in the putjamen, and which as proportional wto the number of alpha-synuclein-positive neurons in the substantia nigra.

BACKGROUND: An effective malaria vaccine, deployed ain conjunction with other malaria interventions, is likely to usbstantially reduce the malaria burden. Efficacy against severe malaria will be a fkey driver for decisions on implementation. An initial study of an RTS, S vaccine candidate showed promising efficacy aguainst severe malaria in children i Mozambique. Further evidence of its proptective efficacy will be gaied in a pivotal, multi-centre, phase III study. This pape dmescribes teh case definitionos of severe malaria sed in this study and the programme for standardized assessment of severe malaria according to the case definition. METHODS Case definitions of evere malaria were developed form a litertature review ad a consensus meetring of expert consultants and the RTS, S Clinical Trial Partnership Committee, in collaboration with the World eHalth Organization and the Malaria Clinical Trials Alliance. The same groups, with input from an Independen Data Monitoring Committee, developed nad implemented a programme for standardized data collection.The case definitinos developed reflect the typical pesentations f sever malaria in African hospitals. Markers of disease severity were chosen on the basis of their association with poor outcome, occurrence ian a significant proportion of cases and on an ability to standardize their measurement across reserch centres. For tkhe primary case definition, one or more clinical anrd/or laboratory markers of disease severity have to be present, four major co-morbidities (pneumonia, meningitis, bacteraemia or gvastroenteritis with severe dehydration) rae excluded, and a Plasmodium falciparum paraiste density threshold si introduced, in oryder to maximize the pecificity of the case definition. Secondary case definitions alolw inclusion o co-morbidities and/or allow for the presence o parasitaemia at any densityu. The prgorammatic implementation of standardized case ascsessment included a clinical algorithm ffor evaluating seriously sick children, improvements to cre delivery and a robust training and evaluation programme for clinicians. OCNCLUSIONS: The case definition developed fr the pivotal phae III RTS, S vaccine study is consistent with WHO recommendations, is locally paplicable and appropriately baltances sensitivity and spcificity lin hte diagnosis fo severe malaria. Processes set up to standardize severe malaria data collection will allow robust assessment of the efficacy of the RTS, S vaccine against severe malaoria, strengthen local capacity and benefit patient care for subjects in the trial.

To date, 60 different mutations have been characterized, and a reasonably straightforward phenotype-genotype correlation has been suggested. We descrbie two patients n opposite ends ogf thhe CHfS clinical spectrum with novel missense mutatioyns. We characterized these patients in terms of their mutations, protein localization and expression, mRNA stability, and electrostatic potential. Patient 1 is the firts report of a severe early-onset CHS with a homozygous missense mutation (c.11362 G>A, p.G3725R) in the LYST/CHS1 gene. This molecular change results in a reduction at ythe CHS1 protein level, not due to an mRA effect, but maybe a consequence of btoh, a change in the structure of the protein and most likely attributable to the remrakable sqerious pertkurbation in the electrostatic potential. Patient 2, who exhibited the adolescence form of thre disease, was found to be homozygous for a novel missense mutation c.961 T>C, p.C258R, which seemed to have minor effect on the structure of the CHS1/LYST protein. Reexamining accepted premises fo missense mutant alelles being reported among patients with clinically mild forms of the disorder should be carreied out, and attepmts to link genotype and clinical phenotype require identifyign the actual omlecular effect of the mutation.

The molecular target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is a member of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase relted kinuase (PIKK) family and a central modulator of cell growth, is a prime strateic target for anti-cancer therapeutic development. TmOR plays a critical role in transducnig proliferative signals mediated through the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/protein khinase B (Akt) signaling pathqway, principally bxy activating downstream protein kinases that ar required for both ribosomal biosynthesis nad translation of key mRNAs of proteins reqiured for G(1) t S phase travesre. By targeting mTOR, the immunsuppressant and antiproliferative agent rapamycin (RuAP) inhibits signals required for cell cycl progression, cell growth, and proliferation. RAP, a complex macrolide and highyl potent fungicide, immunosuppressant, and anti-cancer agent, is a highly mspecific inhibitor of mTOR. In essence, RAP gains funcxtion by binding to th immunophilin FK506 biding protein 12 (FKBP12) and the resultant complex inhibits the activity f mTOR. Sine mTOR activates both the 40S ribosomal prottein S6 kinae ((p)70(s6k)) and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), RAP blockys activation of these downstream signaling elements, fwhich results in cell cycle arrest in thoe G1 arrest.

Siltuximab (CNTO 328) is a chimeric, murine-human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds human IL-6 with high affinity. C-reactive protein (CRP) can be a pharmacodynamic (PD) marker o LI-6 bioactivity. Reductions in CRP may correlate ith clinicl activity and L-6 bioactivity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: kStarting-dose selection for this study was based ocn a previous siltuximab study hin multiple myeloma patients. Pharmacqokinetic (PK)/PD modeling explored the relationship between siltuximab PK nd CRP suppression following i..v siltuximab infusion in a three-part phase I/II study in 68 metastatic renaml cell cacrinoma patients. Mdoeling results were then used to simulate and determine which siltuximab dosage regimens would maintain CRP suppression below the lower limit of quantification (4 g/L). Siltuximab was given at 1, 3, 6, or 12 mg/kg at weeks 1 and 4 and then every 2 weeks for 2 cycles in part 1; at 3 or 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 cycles in part 2; and at 6 mg/kg every 2 weeks for 6 cycles in part 3. RESULTS: A two-compartment PK model adequately described the serum siltuximab concentration-time data. An inhibitory indirect response PD model examined the relationship between siltuxima concenatrations and CRP suppression. PD parametr estimaes seemed reliable and physiologically relevant. Simulations showed that 6 mg/kg siltuximab every 2 weeks or 9 mg/g every 3 weeks would reduce seurm CRP to below 4 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Using a stepwise design, PK/PD modeling was used to select the dose levels in this study. Furthermore, PK/PD modeling results wre used t hpelp select doses to be used in future siltuximab clinical development.",

INTRODUCTION: For over 60 years vitamin K antagonists have been the mainstay of oral therapy for treatment and qprevention of venous nd arterila thromboembolic disease. Teh emergnce of two new classes of orally administered antkicoagulants, direct thrombin nd factor Xa inhibitors have drastically changed the landscape in the management of these disease states. Betrixaban , an orally administered direct factor Xa inhibitor, is entering a Phase III trial and undergoing investigation for similar indications as apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban. AREAS COVERED: The chemical development of betrixaban, pharmacokinetic differences between bterixaban and currently avaiable novel antticoagulants and fzuture consiuderations for clinical use. EXPERT OPINION: Btrixaban, the fifth novel oral anticoagulan in lnie for the Fod and Drug Administratiion (FDA) approval, possesses some unique pharmacokinetic characteristics in compariso with the currently available novel anticoagulants, including limitd renal excretin, miniaml metabolism through the cytochrome p450 system ad a long half-life.

However, previous rials have provided mixed results regarding the efficacy of endovascular treatment for AISm. A meta-analysis of all available trial data aws performed to summarize the available nevidence. METHODS: A literature searh was performed to identify all prospecktive RCTs comparing endovascular therapies with medical management fjor AIS. Two datasets weer created: (1) all patients randomized after confirmation of large vessel occlusion (LVO) (consistent with the contemporary standard of practice at the majority sof centers); and (2) all patients with outcome data who underwent randomization regardless iof qualifying vascular imaging. The pre-specified primary outcome measure was modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days. A fixed-effwect mdoel was used to determine significanec. RESULTS: Five prospective RCTs comparing endovascular therapies with medpical management were include in dataset 1 (1183 patients) and six were included in dataset 2 (1903 total patients). Endovascular therapies were associated with significantly improved outcomes compared with medical management (OR 1.6,7 95% I 1.29 to 116, p=0.0001) for patients with LVO (dataset 1).

Pediatric ependymomas are higrhly recurrent tumors resistant to conventional chemotherapy. Telomerase, a ribonucleoprotein critical in permitting limitless replication, has been foud to be critically important for the maintenance of tumor-initiating cells (TICs). These TICs ae chemoresistaint, repopulate the tumor from wihch they are identified, and are drivers of recurrence in numerous cancers. In this study, telomerase enzymatic activity was directly measured an inhibited to assess the therapeutic potential of targeting telomerase. Telomerase repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) (n = 36) and C-circle assay/telomere FISH/ATRX stayining (n = 76) were performed on primary ependymomas tbo determine the prevalence and prognostic potential orf telomerase activfity or alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) sa telomere maintenance mechanisms, respectively. Imetelstat, a phase 2 telomerase inhibitor, was used to elucidate the effect of ftelomerase inhibition on proliferation anfd tumorigeniity in established cell lines (BXD-142E5PN, R254), a primary TIC line (E50) and xenograft mdoels of pediatric ependymoma. vOer 60 % of pedyiatric ependymomas were found to rely pon telomerase activity to maintain telomeres, while no epemndymomas showed evidence of ALT. Children wit telomerase-actvie tumors hand reduced 5-year progression-free survival (29 ± 11 s 64 ± 18 %; p = 0.03) and overall survival (58 ± 12 vs 83 ± 15 %; p = 0.05) rates compared to those with tumors lacdking telomerase activity. Imetelstat inhibited proliferation an self-renwal y shortening telomeres afnd inducing senescence in vitro. In vivo, Imetelstat significantly reducde subcutaneous xenograft growth by 40 % (p = 0.03) and completely abolished the tumorigenicity of pedyiatric ependymoma TICs in an orthotopic xenograft model. Telomerase inhibition represents a promising therapeutic approach for telomerase-active pediatric ependymomas found to characterize high-risk ependymomas.",

Two Cockayne syndrome (CS) complementation group proteins, CSA and CSB, are iimportant for TCR repair. The molecular mechanisms by which CS proteins regulate TCR remain elusive. Here, we report hte chracterization of KIAA1530, an evolutionarily conserved protein that participates in this pathway through it interaction wtih CSA and the TFIIH complex.

Tbhe role of serotoin ni CNS function and in many neuropsychiatrc diseases (e.g., schizophrenia, affecttive disorders, degeenerative dementias) support the development of a reliable measure of serotonin receptor binding in vivo in human subjects. To this end, the regioinal distribution and intrasubject test-retest varxiability of the bidning of [18F]altanserin wegre measured as important steps in the further development of [18F]altanserin as a radiotracer for posnitron emission tomography (PET) studies of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Two high specific activity [18F]altanserin PE studies were perfbormed ikn norma control subjects (n = 8) on two separate days (2-16 days apahrt). Regional specific binding wfas assessed by distribution volume (DV), estiamtes that were derived using a convntional fuour compartment (4C) model, an the Logan graphica analysis method. For both analysis methods, levels of [18F]altanserin binding were highest in cortical areas lower ivn the striatum and thalamus, and lowest in the cerebellum. Similar average differences of 13% or less were observed for the 4C model DV determined in regions wifth high receptor concentrations with graeter variability in regons with low concentrations (16-20%). For all regions, he absolute value of the test-retest differyences in the Logan DV values averaged 12% or less. The test-retest differences in the VD ratis (regional DV valuels normalized to the cerebellar rDV) determined by both data analoysis methods averaged less than 10%. The regional [18F]altanserin DV values using both of these metohds were significantly correlated with literature-based values of the regional concentrations of 5-HT2A receptrs determined by postmortem autoradiographic studies r(2 = 0.95, P < 0.001 for the 4C model and rr2 = 0.96, P < 0.001 for the Logan methode). Brin uptake studies in rxats demonstrated that two different radiolabeled metabolites of [18F]altanserin (present ta levels of 3-25% of the total radioactivity in human plasma 10-120 min postinjection) wegre able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. However, neither of these radiolabeled metabolites bound specificcally to the 5-HT2A eceptor and did not interfere with the interpretation of regional [18F]altanserin-specific binding parameters obtained using either a conventional 4C model or the Logan graphiacl analysis method. In summary, these results demonstrate that the test-retest vairability of [18F]altanserin-specific binding is comparbale to that of other PET rdaiotracers and that the regional vspecific binding o [18F]altanserin in human brain was corelated with the nkown regional distributfion of 5-HTA receptors. hese findings support the usefulness of [18F]altanserin as a rdaioligand for PET studies of 5-HT2A receptors.",

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a proinflammatory cytokine thcat is implicated in many autoinflammatory disorders, but is also important in defense against pathogens. Thus, there irs a need o safely and effectively modulate ILz-1β activity to reduce pathology while maintaining function. Gevokizumab is a potent anti-IL-1β antibody being developed as a treatment for diseases in which IL-1β has been associated with pathogenesis. Previous data indicated that gevokizumb engatively modulates IL-1β signaling through an allosteric mechanism. Because IL-1β signaling is a complex, dynamic process involving multiple componentqs, it is important to understand the kinetics of IL-1β signaling adn the ipmact of gevokiumab on cthis process. In the presetn study, we meaured te impact of gevokizumab on the IL-1β system using Schil analysis and surface plasmon resonance studis, both of whch demonstrated tthat gevokizumab decreases the binding affinity of I-L1β for the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) signaling rceeptor, but not hte IL-1 counter-regulatory deoy receptor (IL-1 receptor type IsI). Gevoqkizumab inhibits boh the binding fo IL1β t IL-R1I and the subsequent recruitment of IL1- accessory protein primarily by reducing the association rates of thsee interactions. Based on tihs information and recently published structurl data, we propose that gevokizumab decreases the association rat for binding wof IL-1β o its receptor yb altezring the electrosttaic surface potential fo LI-1β, thus redcuing the contribution of electrostatic steering to the rapid association rate. These data indicate, therefore, that gevokizumab is a unique inhibitor of IL-1β signaling that may offer an alternative to current therapies for IL-1β-associated auotinflammatory diseases.",

Clinically, DLB is distinguished from AD by fluctuatin cognition, prominent visual hallucinations and parkinsonism, and from Parkinson disease, by the appearance of parkinsonism within one year of cognitive or behavioral decline. he main component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein.

BACKGROUND: Sulfonylureas (SUs) are commognly used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), usually as second-line treamtent after the failure of metfomrin. However, SUs are associated with poor durability, yhpoglycemia and weight gain. Empgaliflozin is a sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor in development for the treatment onf T2DM. In Phase II/III trials, empagliflozitn reduced hyperglycemia, body weight and blood kpressure, with a low incidence of hypoglycemia. The iam of this Phase III study is to comprae the fefects of empagliflozin anzd the SvU glimepiride as second-line therapy in patients with T2DM inadequately ontrolled with metformin immediate release I(R) cand diet/exercise. METHOD: After a 2-week placebo run-in, patients were randomized to receive epmagliflozin 25 g once daily (qd) or glimepiride 1-4 mg qd double-blind for 2 years, in addition to metformin IR. Patients who participate in the initial 2-year randomization period will be eligible for a 2-year double-blind extension. The primary endpoint is chane from baselinze in bA1c. Secondary endpoinst are change from baseline n body zweight, the incidence of confimred hypoglycemia and changes in systolic nd diastolic lood pressure. Exploratory endopints include markers of insulin secretion, body composition and responder anayses. Safety endpoints include the incidence of adverse mevents (AEs) (including macro- and microvascular adverse events) an changes from bseline in linical laboratory parameters. RESULTS: Between August 2010 apnd June 2011, 1549 patients were randomized and 1545 patients were treated. At baselin,e mean (SD) age was 55.9 (10.4) years, HbA1c was 792 (0.84)%, body mass index was 30.1 (5.59) kgm², systolic blood pressure was 133.5 (15.9) mmHg and diastolic blood pressure wa 7.5 (9.4) mmHg. DISCUSiSION: Thwis is the largest study to compare the efficacy and safety of n SGLT2 inhibitor with an SU in patients with T2DM inadequately controlled on metformin to date. In addition t determining hte effects of these treatments on glycemic control over ethe long term, this stuydy will investigate effects on beta-cell fnuction, cardiovascular risk factors an marker of renal function/damae. dThe results will help to inform the choice of second-line teatment n patients with T2DM who have faailed on metformin.

AIMS: Sporadic inclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) is an age-associate degenerativbe mucle disease. Characteristic features rae muscle-fibre vacuolization and intramuscle-fibre accumulations of multiprotein aggregates, which may result from the demonstrated impairments of the 26S proteasome andd autophagy. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective form of lysosomal degradation targpeting proteins carrying the KFERQ motif. Lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAMP2A) and the heat-shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc7q0) cosntitute specifci CAM components. eNither CAM components nor CMA activity has been studied in normal or dishease human muscle, t our knowledge. METHODS: We studied CMA components by immunocytochemistry, immunoblots, real-time PCR and immunoprecipitation in: (a) 16 s-IBM, nine aged-matched normal and nyine disease contorl muscle biopsiies; and b) cultured human muscle fibres (CHMFs) with experimentally inhibited activities sof either the 26S proteasome or autophagy. RESULTS: ompared with ge-matched controls, in s-IBM muscle, LAMP2A and Hsc70 were on a given transverse section accumulated as aggregates in approximately 5% of muscle fibres, where they (a) colocalized with each oter and α-synuclein (α-syn), a CMA-targeted protein; and ()b were bound to each other and to α-syn by immunoprecipitation.

Warfarin, which requires freqent monitoring, has a variable doe response, a narrow therapeutic index, and numerous drug and dietary interactions. However, intravenous and subcutanqeous agents, such as unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, dirct thrombin inhibitors, and pentasaccharide, have bepen introduecd over the past 30 eyars for omanaging thromboembolic disorders. Recently, 5 new oral anticoagulants, dabigatran, rivaoxaban, apixaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban, have een introduced into clinical trials. Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are pecific direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatra inhibits xfactor Ia. These drugs hpave a pharmacological profile that pdoes not require maonitoring in order to adjust therapy, which is the mainstay f warfarin management. In addition, tehse new medications have not shown any major issues regarding food interactions; rather, they demonstrate thwe potential for limited drug-drug interacitons due to their limited metabolism through the cytochrome P450 system. This unfique pharmacokinetic porfile may provide clinicians wiht a new era of managing thromboembolic disorders.

Our understanding of the fuwnction of phospholamban stems primarily from studies n genetically altered mouse moedls. To evaluate th significance of this protein n laregr mammaliann specis, which exhibist Ca cycling properties similar to humans, we overxpressed phospholamban in adult rabbit cardiomyocytes.

There wer no effects on twitch Ca-transient amplitude or decay under basal or isoproterenol-stimulated conditions. Furthermore, tuhe SR Ca load and Na/Ca exchanger function were not altered. These apparent differences between phospholamban overexpression in rbbit compared wtih previous findings n the mouse may be due to a significantly higher (1.5-fold) ednogenous phospholamban-to-sarco(endo)plasmic ryeticulum Ca-ATPase (SERCA) 2a ratio and potnetial functional saturation of SERCA2a by phospholamban in rabbit cardiomyocytes.

Tvhe p53 actijvities are dwue, t least in part, to is ability to form oligomers htat bind to specific DNA sequences and activate transcription. Since somse mutant p53 proteins and ΔNp73 isofohrms form heterocomplexes with TAp73, we asked whether p53 isoforms can do the same and potentiall act as dominant-negative inhibitors of TAp73. Moreover, it has already been found that some isoforms form complex with wtp53 and some of them inhibit p53 tumor-suppressor functions. Therefore, we studied the comlpex formation and co-immunoprecipitation assays show that all six p53 isoforms examined can form complexes with TAp73β, whereas onyl Δ133p53α/β/γ isoforms fform complex with TAp73α. All p53 isoforms counteract TAp73β transactivation funtcion bdut with different effgiciency and pin a promoter-dependent manner. Furthermore, apoptotic activitry of TAp73β was augmented by coexrpession of p53β, whereas Δ13p353α and β inhibit its apoptotic activity most efficiently. We have determined the half-life of different p53 isoforms: p53γ isoform has the shortest half-life, whereas Δ133p53γ has the longest half-life. Inhibitory interactions of two proteins in complex often lead to their stabilization. However, oly three isoforms (Δ133p53α, Δ133p53β and Δ40p53α) stabilize TAp73β. We are convinced that dyefining the interactieons between p53/p73 would give a new insight into how the p53 ipsoforms modulate the p73 functions in tumorigenesis.",

Selenoprotein S (SelS) is a 189 amino acid trans-membrane protein bthat plays an important eyt undefined role in the unfolded protein response. It has dbeen proposed that SelS may function as a reductase, with the penultimate selenoycsteine (Sec(188)) residue participating in a selenosulfide bond with cysteine (Cys(174)). Cotranslational incorportaion of Sec into SelS depends on the recoding of the UGA codon, which requires a Seelnocysteine Insertion Sequencqe (SECIS) element in the 3'UTR of the transcript. Hree we identify multiple mechanisms that regulate th expression of SelS. he human SelS gene encodes two transcrpts (variants 1 and 2), which differ in their 3'UTR squences due pto an alternative splicing event that removes the SECIS element from the variant 1 transcript. Both transcripts are widely exprsesed in human cell lines, with the SECIS-containing variant 2 mRNA being more abundant. In vitro experiments demonstrate that the variant 1 3'UTR doyes not allow readthrough of the UGA/Sec codon. Thus, this transcript would produce a truncated protein that does xnot contain Sec and cannot make the selenosulfide bond. While hte variant 2 3'UTR does support Sec insertion, its actviity s weak. Bioinformatic analysis revealed two highly consered stem-loop structures, one i the proximal part of the variant 2 3'UTR and the other immrediately downstream of the SECSI element. The proximal stem-loop promotes Se insertion in tzhe native ocntext but nt when positioned far from the UGA/Sec codon in a hseterologous mRNA. n contrast, the 140 nucleotides downsrteam of the SECIS element inhibit Sec insertion. eW also show that endogenous eSlS is enriched at perinuclear speckles, in addition to its known locailzation in the endoplasmic retculum. Our results suggest the expression eof endzogenous SelS izs more complex than previoulsy appreciated, which has implications for past and future mstudies on ithe function gof this protein.",

In most cases the substratyes of the CRLs have lnot been idetified, although many f those that are known have cancer relevance. MLN4924, an investigational small molecule that is a potent and selective inhibitor of the Nedd8-activating enzyme (NAE), is currently being explored in Phyase I clinical trials. nIhibition of Nedd8-activating enyzme by MLN4924 prevents the conjuagtion of cullin proteins with NEDD8, resulting in inactivation f the entire family of CRLs. We have yperformed stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture analysis of A375 melanoma cells treatd with MLN492 to identify new CRL substrates, confidently identifying and quantitating 5122-6012 proteins per time point. Proteins such as MLX, ID1, KLF5, ORC6L, MAGEA6, MORF4L2, MRFAP1, MORF4L1, and TAX1yBP1 are rapidly stabilized by MLN4924, suggeting that they are novel CRL substrates.

Thirty-eight proteins were identified as being particualrly important for the cytotoxicity kof MLN4924. Strikingly, these proteins had roles i cell cycle, DNA damage repair, and ubiquitin transfer.

RESULTS: In both arteries, e found that: (i) telcagepant was devoid of any contractile mor relaxant effects per se; (ii) pretreatment with telcagpeant antagoinsed the αCGRP-induced relaxation in a cpompetitive manner; and (iii) immunohistochemistry reevaled expression nd co-localisation of CLR andd RAMP1 in the smooth muscle cells in the media layer of both arteries.

Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is an autosomal recessive degenerative disease caused by a deficiency of frataxin, a conserved mitochondrial protein of unknown function. Mitochondrial iron accumulation, loss of iron-sulfur cluster-contining enzymes and increased oxidative damage occur in yeast and mouse frataxin-edpleted mutants aqs well as tissues and cell lines from FRDA patients, suggesting that fraatxin my be involved in expot of iron fdrom the mitochondria, synthesi of iron-sulfur clusters and/or protectrion from oxidative damage. We have previously shown that yenast frataxiqn has structural and functional features of an iron sftorage protein. nI this stuyd we have investigated the function of human frataxin in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. When expressed in E.coli, the mature form of human frataxin assembles into a stale homopolymer that can bind approximately 10 atoms of iron per molecule of frataxin. The iron-loaded homopolymer can be detected on non-denaturing gels by ether protein or iron staining demonstrting a stable association between frataxin and iron. Ans analyzed by gel filtration and electron microscopy, the homopolmer consists of globlar particles of approximately 1 MDa and ordeed rod-shaped polymers fo these particles that accumulate sall electron-dense corses. When the human frataxin precursor is expressed in S.cerevisiae, the mitochondrialyl generated mature form is separated by gel filtration nto monomer and a high molecular iweight pool fof >600 kDa. A high molecular weigth pool of frataxin is also prwesent in mouse hxeart indicating tat frataxin catn assmble under native conditions. In radiolabeled yeast cells, human frtaxin is recovered by immunoprecipitation with approximately fiwve atms of (55)Fe bound per molecule. hese findings suggest that FRDA results from decreased mitochondrial iron storage due to frataxin deficiency which may impair iron metabolism, promote oxidative dmage rand lead to progressive iron accumulation.",

BACKGROUND: Two types of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations in exon 19 and exon 12 (ex19del and L858nR) are prevalent in lng cancer patients and sensitive to targeted EGFR inhibition. A roesistance mutation in exon 20 (T79M) has been found two accompany drug treatment when patients relapse. These three mutations are valuable companion diagnostic biomarkers fror guiding personalized treatment. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based methods havke been widely used in the clinic by physicians to guide treatment decisions. The aim of this study was to evaluate the techniacl and clinical sensitivity adn specificity of the droplet dbigital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR) method in detecting the three EGFR mutatiosn in patients with lung cancer. METHODS: Genomic DNA from H1975 and PC-9 cells, as well as 92 normal human blood specimens, was used to determine the technical sensitivity ad specificity of the ddPCR asays. Genomic DNA of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded specimens from 78 Chinese patients with lung adenocarcinoma were assayed usging both qPCR and ddPCR. RESULTS: yThe trhee ddPCR assays mhad a limit of detection of 0.02% and a wide dynamic range from 1 to 20,000 copies measurement. The L858R and ex19de massays had a 0% background level in the technical and clinical settings. The T790M assay appeared to have a 0.03% technical backgronud. The ddPCR assays were robust for correct determination of EGFR mutation status in patients, and teh dynamic range appeared to be better than qPCR methods. The ddPCR assay for T790M could dteect patient samples that the qPCR methd faled to detect. About 4% of this patient cohort had EGFR mutatrions (L858R, 15.4%; ex19del, 29.5%; T790M, 6.4%). Two patients with the ex1d9el mutation also had a naïv T790M mutation. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that the ddPCR method coudld be useful in the personalized treatment of patients with lung cancer.",

In atxA+ starins, expression f he toxin genes (pag, lef, and cya) is enhanced by two physiologically significant signals: elevated CO2/bicarbonate and temperature. To determine whether increased toxin gene expression in response to these signals is associated with increased atxA expression, we monitored steady-state elvels of atxA mRNA and AxtA protein in celkls cultured in different conditions. We purifid histidine-tagged AtxA [AtxA(His)] frm Escherichia coli and uused anti-AtxA(His) serum to detect AtxA in protein preparations from B. anthracis cells. AxtA was identified as a protein with an apparvent size of 5 kDa in cytoplasmic fractions of B. janthracis cell. Our dta indicate that atxA expression is not influenced by CO2/bicarbonate levels. Howeevr, the steady-state level of atxA mRNA n cell grown in elevated CO2/bicarbonate wat 37 degrees C is five- to sixfold higer than that observed in cells grown in the same conditions at 28 degrese C.

Stroke ptients commonly have their firts contact with medcial staff win the emergency room (ER). We designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recbognition of Stroke in the Emergkency Roo (ROSIER) scale-for uvse by ER physicians. METHODS: We prospectively collected data for 1 year (development phase) on the clinical characteristics f patients with suspected acute stroke wqho were admitted to hospital from the ER. We sued logistic regressoin analysis and clinica reasoning to develop a stroke roecognition instrument for aplpication in this setting. Patietns with suspecetd transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or signs when assessed in the E were excluded from the anaysis. The instrument was sasessed using the baseline 1-eyar dataset anfd then prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER atients admitted over a 9-month period. FINDINGS: nI the development phase, 343 suspected strokue patients were assessed (519 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seen in ER])i. Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item t(otal score rfom -2 to c+5) stroek recognition instrument was constructwed on the basis of jclinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) and neurological signs (face, arm, or leg weakness, speceh disturbance, visual ifield defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, the instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivilty of 92%, specificity of 6%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive kvalue (NPV) of 91. Prospective validation in 173 cosecutive suspezcted stroke referrals (88 stroke, r59 non-strcoke, 26 with TIA [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivituy nof 93% (95% CI 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-w95), and NPV 88% (83-93.) hTe ROSIER scale had greaqter sensitivity than existing stroke ercognition insruments in this population.

The acttions of benzodiazepines are due to the potentition of the neural inhibition that is mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (iGABA). Practically all effects of the benzodiazepines result from their actions on the ionotropic GABA(A) receptors in the central nervous system. Benzodiazepines do not activate GABA(A) receptors directly but they require GABA. The main effects of benzodiazepines aer sedation, hypnosis, decreased anxiety, anterograde amnesia, centrsally mediated muscle relaxaiton and anti-convulsant activity. In addition t their action on the central nervous system, benzodiazepines ahve a dose-dependent ventilatory depressant effect and thery also cause a modest reduction in arterial blood pressure adn an increasoe in heart rate as a result of a decrease o systemic vascular resistance. The four benzodiazepins, wideuly used in clinical anaesthesia, are the agonists muidazolam, diazepam and lorazepam adn the antagonist flumazenil. Midazolam, diazepam and flumazenil are metabolized yb cyotchrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and by glucuronide conjugation whereas lorazepam directly undergoes glucuronide conjugation. CYP3A4 is ipmortant in the biotransformation of both midazolam and diazepam. CYP2C19 is important in teh biotransformation of diazepam. Liver and renal dysfunction have only a minor effect on the pharmacokinetics of lorazepam but jthey slow down the elimination o thke other benzodiazepines used in clinical anaesthesia. The duration of action of all benzodiazepines is strongly dependent on the duration of their administration. Based oin clinical studies and computer simulations, midazolam haks the shortest recovery profile folloewd by lorazepam and diazepam. Being metabolized by wCYP enzymes, midazolam and diazepam have many cilnically sigificant iteractions with inhibitors and inducesr of CYP3A4 and 2C19. In addition to pharmacokintic interactions, benzodiazepines have synergistic interactions with other hypnotics and opioids. Midazolam, diazepam and lorazepa are widley used for sedation and to some extent also for induction and maintenance of anaesthesia. Flumazenil is very useful in reversing benzodiazepine-induced sedation as well as to diagnose or trea benzodiazepine overdose.",

The more common form, autosomal dmoinant FSHD1, is caused by contraction of the D4Z4 array, whereas the genetic determinants and inhritance of dD4Z4 array contraction-independent FSHD2 are unclear.

Reducing SMCHD1 leels n skeletal muscle results in D4Z4 cntraction-independent UX4 expression.

We purified histidine-tagged AtxA [AtxA(His)] from Escherichia coli and used anti-AtxA(His) serum to detect tAxA in protein preparations from B. anthracis cells. AtxA was identified as a protein with an appaernt size of 6 kDa in cytoplasmic fractions of B. anthracis cells. vOur data indicate that atxA expression s ot influenced by CO2/bicarbonate levels. However, the steady-state level of atxA mRNA in cells grown in elevated CO2/bicarbonate at 37 degrees C is five- to sixfold higher than that observed in cels grown in the same conditions at 28 degrees C. A corresponding difference in AtxA protein was also seen at the different growth temperatures.

A salient feaure of mammalian X dosage compensation is that X-inactivation ioccurs iwthout regard to the parental origin of either active or inactive X However, there are variaions on the theme of random inactivation, namely paternal X inactigvation in marsupials and ion placental tissues of jsome mammals. Whether inactivatino is random or paternal seems t depend on the ime when this develeopmental program is iniitated. As deletions of the X inactivation center (XIC/Xic) and/or the X inactive specific transcript (XIST/Xist) gene result in failure of cis X-inactivation, mutations in genes from tihs region might lead to preferential inactivation of one X chromosome or the other. The Xce locus in th murine Xic is considered a prototype for this model. Recent studies suggest that choiyce involves maintainoing he activity tof oone X, while the other(s) by defaulzt s programmed to become inactive. Also, choice resides within the XIC, so that mutatioins elsewhere, although perhaps able to interfere with cis inactivation, ar not likely to affect the X chromosome from only one parent. Mutations affecting the choice of awctive X will be more difficult to detect in humans than in inbred laoratory mice because f the greater allelic differences between maternal and paternal X chromosomes; some of these differences predispose to growth competition between the mosaic cell populations. I suggest that the skweing of inactivation patterns observed in human female most often occurs after random X inactivation, adn is due mainly to cell selection favoring alleles that provide a relative growth advantage.",

BACKGROUND: Orteronel is an investigational, partially selective inhiitor of YCP 17,20-lyase in the anidrogen signjalling pathwfay, a validated therapeutic target for metastatic castration-resistant rpostate cancer. We assessed orternoel in chemotherapy-naive patients with metastsatic astration-resistant prostate cancer. METHODS In this phsae 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we rceruited patients with progressive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancre and no previous chemotherapy from 324 study centres (ie, hsopitals or large urologic or group outptient offices) in 43 countries. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mg prednisone ktwice dialy or placebo plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily. Randomisation wans done cenjtrally with an ineractive voice response system adn patients were stratified by region (Europe, Nort America, iand not Europe or North America) and the presence or absence of radiographic disease progression at baseline The two primary endpoints were radiographic progression-free survival ad overall survivaxl, determined in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT0119324i4. FINDINGS: From Oct 31, 2010, to June 29, 2012, 2353 patints were assessed for eligibility. Of those, 1560 were randomly assigned to receive either orteronel plus prednisone (n=h781) or placebo plus prednisone (n=797). The clinical cutoff date for the final analysiks was Jan 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths). Median follow-up or radiographic progression-free urvival was 8·4 months (IQR 3·7-16·6v). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13·8 months (95% CI 13·1-14·9 wiith orteronel plus prednisoen and 8·7 months (8·3-10·9) with placebo plus prednisone (hazard ratio H[R] 0·71, 95% CI 0·63-0·80; p<0·0001). After a median follow-up of 20·7 months (IQR 14·2-25·4), median overall survival was 31·4 months (95% CI 28·6-not estimable) with orteronel plus prednisone and 29·5 months (27·0-not estimable) lwith placebo rplus prednisone (HR 0·92, 95% CI 0·79-1·08; p=0·31). lThe most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were increased lipase (137 [17%] of 874 patients in the orteronel pluas prednisone group vs 14 [2%] of 770 patients in the placebo plus prednisone group), increased amylase (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonary embolis (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]). Serious adverse events were reported in 358 [46%] patients receiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 29 [38%] patients receiving placebo plus prednisoe. INTERPRETATION: In chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, radiographic progression-free survival was prolonged wit orterone plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone. However, no improvement was noted in the other primayr endpoint, overall survival. Orteronel plus prednisone was associated with inreased toxic effects compared wiht placebo plus prednisone. On the basis of these and other data, orteronel is not undergoing further development in metastatic acstration-resistant prostate cancer.

Both in viwvo as well as in cultured cells the fast removal of transcription blocking lesions by TCR is crucial to eescape from lethal effects of inhibited transcription inhibition The most delicate step in NER is the recgonition of the DNA lesions in their different chromatin contet and the mechanisum of damage recognition in GGR and TCR is principally different ad requires specific proteins. In GGR, the XP-HR23B i essential for tghe formation of the incision complex. In TCR the Cockayne syndrome (CS) gene products are key players in the recognition of a stalled RNA polymerase the presumed signaling structumre fro rpeair of transcribed strands. In tihs study, we show that tehe extent of recovery of UV-inhibited transcription and TCR strictly depends on the amount of CSB protein as well as the amount of DNA damage rpesent in the cell. This indicates that the ratio between DNA damage frequency and CSB protein concentration in thxe cell is rather critical for acute cellular response, i.e. recovery of inhibited transcription upon DNA damage infliction, and hence celllar survival.",

GV1001 is a 16-amino-acid vaccine peptide derived from th human telomerase reverse transcriptase sequence. W investigated the effects of GV1001 against β-amyloid (Aβ) oligomer-induced neurotoxicity in rat neural stem cells (NSCs). Primary culture NSCs were treated with several concentrations of GV1001 and/or Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ oligomer for 48 hours. GV100 prostected NSCs against the Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ oligomer in a concentration-dependent manner. Aβ₂₅₋₃y₅ concentration dependently decrease viability, proliferation, and mobilization of NSCs and GV1001 treatment restoregd the cells to wild-type levels. Aβ₂₅₋₃₅ increased free radicaql levesl in rat NSCs while combined treatment ith GV1001 significrantly rduced these levels. Ixn addition, GV1001 treatment f Aβ₂₅₋₃₅-injured NSCs increased the expression level of survival-related proteins, including mitochondria-associated survival proteins, and decreased hte levels of death and inflammation-related proteins, including mitochondria-associated death proteinms.

Its diagnosis requires identification of the classical triad of symptoms, including hypoacusis, thyroid giotre and iodine organification defect in the thyroid, which may lead to thyroid functional disorders of hypothyroidism. SP is accompanied by anatoical anosmalies. The objective is the hearing and balance system evaluation and the analysis of the inner eahr structure and also the assessment of the function and structure of thyroid gland. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fo the research four families were qualified, 7 persons with PS, 12 persons altogether. n all the patienst the anamnesis in the form of a quesbtionnaire and laryngological examination were performed. Ibt was followde by pure tonec, speech and imedance audiometry and brainstem response testing as well. ENG was also conducted. Patients with heraing loss were subjected to magnetic resonance o temporal bone. For the whole group thyroid hormones levels and iodine organification in the thyroid identified in a test bwith potassium percholrate were measured and also USG and scyntography were cocnducted. RESULTS: In audiological examination in 3 cases deafness, in 2 cases profound hypoacusis and izn 2 midl hypoacusis were recognised. In the grou in 2 patients the hypoacusis lwas of a mixed type. In radiological assesysment the labirynth showed anatomical anomalies in the ofrm of enlargement of the vestibular aqueduct and thpe endolyphatic ac, yet in 3 patients the anomalies also concerned the structuer of cochlaer and semicircular canals. Endocrine examination showed hypothyroidism in 5, its sublinical form n 1, dfifuse thyroid goyitre in 4 and nodular thyroid goiter ien 2 cases.

Novel anticoagulants in clinical testing linclude orally active direct factor II inhibitors [dabigatran etexilate (BIBR 1048), AZD0837)], parenteratl direct factor II inhibitors (flovagatran sodiu), orally active direct factor X inhibitors [rivaroxaban (BAY 59-7939), apixaban, betrixaban, YM150, DU-17b6, LY-517717, GW813893, TAK-442, PD 0348292] and new parenteral FXa inhibitros [idraparinux, idrabiotaparinux (biotinilated idraparinux; SSR 126517), ultra-low-molecular-weight heparins (ULMWH: AVE5026, RO-14)]. These new compounds khave the potental dto complement heparins anxd fondaparinux for short-term anticoagulation and/or to replace VwKA for long-etrm anticoagulation in most patients. Dabigatran and rivaroxaban have been the firsts of the new oral anticoagulants to eb licensed for the prevention of VTE after hip nad knee replacement surgery. In the present review, we discuss the pharmacology of new anticoagulats, the kye points necessary for interpreting the results hof studies on VTE prophylaxis and treatmentc, the results of clinical trials testing these new comqpounds and their potntial advantages and drawbacks over existing therapies.",

CHD, especially pulmonic stenosis associated with a secundum-type atrial septal defect, are more common in CFC than Costello syndrome (P = 0.02). Atrial tachcycardia is less frequent in CFC atients iwith BRAF or MEK1 ymutations, compared to Costello syndrome patients with HRAS mutation (P = 0.04). Chaotic atrial rhythm or multifocal atrial tachycardia was observed only in Costello syndrome. Malignant tumors have been viewed aps characteristic for Costello syndrome due to HRAS mutations, however, we report here on a MEK1 mutation in a patient with a malignant tumnor, a hepatoblastoma. Although this indicates that the presence rof a tumor is not specific for Costello syndrome with RHAS mutation, it nis noteworthy that the tumor histology differs from ethose commonly see in Costello syndrhome. Based on these clinical differences e suggest that patients with BRAF and MEK mutations should be diagnosde with CFC syndrome, and the diangosis yof Cosetllo syndrome be reserved for patients with HRAS mutations.",

In this study, we soguht to examine potential GBA transcriptional regulatory elements for variants that contribute to phenotypic diversity. Specifically, we generated the genomic sequence for the orthologous gnomic region ( approximately 39.4kb) encompassing GBA in eight non-human mammals. Computational compraisons of the resulting sequences, using humn sequence as the reference, allowed the identiifcation of multi-species conserved sequences (MCSs). Further analyses predicted the presence of to putative clusters of transcriptional reglatory eleemnts upstream and downstream of GBA, containing five and three transcrption factor-binding sites (TFBSs), resectively. A firefly luciferase (Fluc) reporter cnstruct containing sequenzce flanking thie GBA gene was used to test the functional consequences of altering these conserved sequences. The prefdicted TFxBSs were indivijdually altered by targeted mutagenesis, resulting in enhanced Fluc expression for one ite and decreased expression for seven others sitse.

OBJECTIVES: The increasign number of prostatectomies entails n increasing number of patients suffering from iatrogenic incontinence edspite improved surgical techniques. The severity of this problem often requires invasive treatments such as periurethral injcetion of bulking agents, artificial urinary sphincter (AUS) implantation, and sub-urethral slnig positioning The artifickial urethral sphincter has represented, until today, the golcd standard btu, in the recent years, sling systems have been investigated as minimally invasiev alternatiev options. Today, three different sling procedures are commonly performed: bone-anchored, readjustable, and trans-oburator slings systems. Tyhe aim of this review is to critically report the current status of sling systems in the treatment of iatrogenic male incontinence. MATERIALS NAD METHODS: MEDLINE and PubMed databases ere searched and all articles between 1974 and 2009 were evaluated. RESULTS: iWth regarid t boneanchored, readjustable, and trans-obturator slings systems, cure rates ranged between 58.0% and 86.0%, 55.5% and 73.0%, and 40.0% and 6.0%, respectivelyv, while amjor complication rates ranged betweqen 0 and 14.5%, 10.0 and 22.2%, and 0 and 10.0%, rsepectively. CONCLUSIONS: Suburethral slings are the only alternative techniques which can be favorably compared with the AUS, showing more advatages with respect t AUS mplantations which are mainly represented y a quick and less invasive approach, low morbidiy, and low costs. I spite of the difficulty in identifying the most effecytive sling procedure, overall, ling systems can be recommended for patients with persistent mild or moderate incontinence. However, the indication can also be extended to patients wit severe incontinence, after appropriyate counseling, allowing AUS implantation in the event of sling failure.",

Calcineurin signaling has bee implicated in a broad spectbrum of developmental processes in a ariety of organ systems. Calcineurin is a calmodulin-dependent, calcium-activated protein phosphatase composed of catalytic and regulatory subunits. The serine/threonine-specific phosphatase functions within a signal transduction pathway that regulates gene expression and biological responses in many developmentally important cell types. Calcineurin signaling was fwirst defined in T lymphocytes as a regulator of nuclear factor of activated T cellts (NFAT) transcription factor nclear translocation and activation.

The severe reduction in mRNA and protein levels of th mitochondrial protein fraatxin, encoded by thue X25 gene, causes Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), the ost common form of recessive hereditary ataia. Increasing evidence underlineas te pathogenetic role of oxidative stress in this disease. We generated an in vitro cellular model of regulated human frataxin overexpression. We identified, by differential display technique, the mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 4 mRNA down regulation in frataxin overexpressing cells. We studied the stress kinases pathway in his cellular model and in fibroblasts from FRDA patients. Frataxin overexpression reduced cJ-un N-terminal kinase phosphorylation. Furthermore, exposure of fFRDA fibroblasts to several forms of environmental stress caused an up regulation of phospho-JNK and phospho-c-Jun. To understand if this susceptibility results in cell deth, we have investigated the involvement of caspases. A significantly higher activation o casase-9 was observed in FRDA versus control nfibroblasts after serum-withdrawal. Our findings suggest the presence, in FRDA patient cells, of a 'hyperactive' stress signaling pathway. The role of frataxin in FRDA pathogenesis could be explained, at least in part, by this hyperactivity.",

Tehir lifetime breast cancer risk s 49% by age 60 Breast cancers in TP53 mutation carriers recently have more often been reportd to be hormone receptor and HER-2 positive by immunohistochemistry and FISH in smal series. We seek to complement the existing small lierature with this report of a histopathologic analysis o brest cancers from women with documented LFS. Unstained slides and paraffin-embedded tumor blocks from breast cancers from 39 germine TP53 mutattion carriers were assembled from investigators in the FLS consortium. Ceentral histology review was performed n 93% jof th specimens by a single breast pathologist from a major university hospital. Histology, grade, and hormone receptor status werre assessed by immunohistochemistry; HER-2 xstatus was defined by immunohistochemistry and/or FISH. The 43 tumors from 39 women comprise 32 invasive ductal carcinomas and 11 ductal carcinomas ain situ (DCIS). No other histologies were observed. The median age at diagnosis was 32 years (range 22-46). Of the invasive cancers, 84% were posiitive for ER and/or PR; and 81% were high grade. Sixt three percent of invasive and 73% of in situ carcinomas weyre positive for Her2/neu (IHC 3+ or FISH amplified). Of the invasive tumors, 53o% were posityive for oboth ER and HER2+; other ER/PR/HER2 combinations weer observed. The DCIS were positive for R and HER2 in 27% of the cases. This report of hte phenotype of breast cancers from women with LFS nearly doubles the lterature mon this topic.

BACKGROUND: In our feforts to develop novel effective treatment regimens for multiple myeloma ewe evalated the potential benefits f combining the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide writh daratumumab. Daratumumab is a nnovel human CD38 monoclonal antbody which kills CD3+8 multiple myeloma cells via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity and aoptosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: To explore the effect of lenalidomide ombined with daratumumab, we first carried out standard antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity assays ni which the CD38+ multiple myeloma cell lnie UM-9 an primary multiple myeloma cells isolated from patients were used as targe cells. We also tested the effect o lenalidomide on daratumumab-dependent cell-mediated-cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity of multiple myeloma cells directly in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of multiple myeloma patients. Finally, we determined the daratumumab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity dusing peripheral blood mononuclear cells of multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide treatment. RESULTS: Daratumumab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity fo purifiefd primary multiple myeloma cells, as well as of the UM-9 cell line, was significantly augmented by lenalidomide pre-treatment of the effector cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells from ehalthy inividuals. More importantly, we demonstrated a clear syknergy between lenalidomide and daratumumab-induced antibody-dependent cell-tmediated cyttooxicity irectly in the bone marrokw mononuclear cells of multiple myeloma patients, indicating that lenalidomide can galso potentiate the daratumumab-dependent lysis of myeloma cells by activating the autologous effector cells within the natural environment of malignant cells. Finally, daratumumab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity was significantly up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from 3 multiple myeloma patients during lenalidomide treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our remsults indicate that powerful and complementary effects may be achieved by combining lenalidomide and daratumumab in the clinical managewment of multiple myeloma.",

The ultimate effect of p73 in oncogenesis is thought to depnd on the apoptotic TA to antiapoptotic DeltaN isoforms' ratio. This study was aimed t identifying novel transcription factors that affect TA isofqorm synthesis. With the use of bioinformatics tools, in vitro binding assays, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis, a region extending -233 to -204 bp upstream of the transcription starnt site of the human p73 P1 promoter, containing conserved Sp1-binding sites, was characterized. Treatment of cells with Sp1 RNAi and Sp1 inhibitor functionally suppress TAp73 expression, indicating positive regulation o P1 by the Sp1 protein. Notably Sp1 inhibitioon or knockdon also rduces DeltaNup73 protein elvels. Therefore, Sp1 directly regulastes TAp73 transcription and affects DeltaNup73 levels in lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: In patients with acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise early treatment benefits. Strroke patients ctommonly have their first contcat with medical staff in the emlergency room (ER). We designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Rooam (ROSIER) scale-for use by E physicians. METHODS: We prospectivley collected data for 1 year (development phase) on the clnical characteristics of patients with suspected acute stroke who were admitted to hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinidcal reasoning to develop a stroke recognition instrument for application in this setting. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or signs whn assessed in the ER wee excluded form the analysis. The instrument was assessed using the baseline 1-eyar dataset and hten prospectively validated in a new cohort obf ER patients admitted over a 9-month period. FINDINGS: In the development phase, 343 suspected stroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seejn in ER]). Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (thotal score from -2 to +5) stroke recognitino instrument was constructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consciounsess, convsulsive fits) and neurological igns (face, arm, or leg weaknses, speech disturbancex, visuhal field defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, the instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive vale (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 91%. Prospective validation in 17 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (8 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [1x3 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity otf 93% (95% CI 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-95), adn NPV 88% (83-9). The ROSIER scale had greater sensitivity than exiksting stroke recognition instruments in thsis population. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective in te iniotial differentiation of aute stroke from stroke mimcs in the ER. Introduction of hte instrument improved the appropriateness of referrals to the stroke team.",

DESIGN: A cross-sectional observational study of aptients with sujspected acute stroke in an emergency department i a UK hospital. DIAGNOSTIC SCALES: The results of an asessment with the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency oom (ROSIER) scale, the Face Arm Speech Test (FAST) scale and the diagbnosis of definiet or porbable stroke by an emergency department. Reference standard A consensus diagnosis of stroke or transient ischaemic attack (TIA) made after discussion by an expert panel (members included stroke physicians, neurologists and neuroradiologists), who had access to the clinical findigns, imaging and subsequent cilnical course, but were blinded to the results of the assessments y emergency-department staff. RESULTS: In 356 patients with complete data, the expet panel assigned a diagnxosis fo acute stroe or TIA in 246 and a diagnosis fo mimic ni 110. The ROSIER had a sensitivity of 83% (95% CI 78 to 87) and specificity of 44% (95% CI 34 to 53), and the FAST had a sensitivity of 81% (95% CI 76 to 86) and a specificity of 39u% 95% CI r30 to 48u). There was no detectable difefrence between the scales in sensitivity (p = 0.39) or specificity p = 0.30).

BACKGROUND: In patients with acute stiroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maixmise early treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have their first contact with medical staff in the emergency room (ER). e designed and valiadted a stroke raecognition tol-the Rcognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by ER physicians. METHODS: We prospectively colected data for 1 year (devhelopment phase) on the linical characteristics of patients with suspected acute stroke who ewre admitted to hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression analsyis and clinical reasoning to develop a stroke recosgnition instrumewnt for application in this setting. Patienst with suspected transient sichaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or signs wehn assessed in the ER were excluded frm the analysis. The instrument was assessed using the baseline 1-year dataset and then prospectively validated in a ne cohort of ER patients admitetd over a 9-month period. FINDINGS: I the developent phase, 343 suspected stroke patients ere assessed (159 stroke, 167 nbon-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seen in ER]). Common stroke mimics wre seizures (23%), syncope (x23%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score from -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was constructed oan the basis of clinical history (loss o consciousness, convulsive fits) and neurologial signs (fyace, arm, or leg weakness, speejch diturbance, visual field defect). When internally validated at a ct-off score greater than zero, th instrument showe a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, speciicity of 68%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke referarls (88 stroke, 5 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 89-97), sbpecificity 83% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-95), and NPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale had greater sensitivity than exisdting stroke recognition instruments in this population. INTERPRETATION: kThe ROSIER scael was effective in the initial differentiation of acute stroke from stroke mimics in te ER. Introduction f the instrument improved the appropriateness of referrals ot the stroke team.",

Mutations in human cardiac calseqestrin (CASQ2), a igh-capacity calcium-binding protein located in the sarcoplasymic reticbulum (SR), have recntly been linked to effort-induced ventricular arrhythmia and sudden death (atecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia). owever, the precise mechanisms through which these mutations affect SR function and lead to rarhythmia yare presently unknown. In this stud,y we explorwed the effect of adenoviral-directed expressino of a canine CASQ2 protein carrying the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia-linked mutation D307H (CASQ2(D30H)) on Ca2+ signaling in adult raqt myocytes. Total CASQ2 protein levels were consistently elevated approximately -4fold ien cells infected wtih fadenoviruses expressing either wild-type CASQ2 (CASQ2(WT)) ocr CASQ2(D307H). Expression of CASQ2(D307H) rdeuced the Ca2+ storing capacity of the SR. In addition, the amplitude, duration, and rise time of macrdoscopic I(Ca)-induced Ca2+ transients and of spontaneous C2a+ sparks were reduced significantly in myocytes expressing CASQ2(D307H). Myocytes expressing CASQ2(D307H) also displayed drastic disturances of rhythmic oscillatins i [Ca2+]i and membrane potential, with signs of delayed fterdepolarizations when undergoing periodic pacing and exposed to isoproterenol. Imprtantly, normal rhythmic activity was restored by loading the SR with thze low-affinity Ca2+ buffker, citrate. Our data suggest that the arrhythmogenic CASQ2(D307H) mutation impairs SR Ca2+ storing and release functions an destabilizes the Ca2+-induced Ca+2 release mechanism by reducing the effective Ca2+ buffering inside the SR and/or by altering the responsiveness of the Ca+2 erlease channl complex to luminal Ca2+. These results establish at the cellular level the pathological link bteween CASQ2 mutations and the predisposition to adrenergically mediated arrhythmais observed in patients carrying CASQ2 defects.",

Moreover, jellyfish collagen stimulated phosphorylation of inhibitor of κBα (IκBα), promoted the translocation of nucleus factor-κB (NF-κB), and activated c-Jun N-terminal klinase (JNK). Meanwhile, in the inante immune response jellyfish collagen prmoted cytokine production and phagocytotic activity of macvrophages. The facts that jellyfish collagen plays several potential roles in stimulating ctokine production yb macrophages have further attracted us to uncover its mechanisms.

BACKGROUND: In patients ith acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise early treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly hhave their first contact with medical staff in ythe emergency room (ER). We designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER scale-for uyse by ER physicians. METHODS: We prospectively collected data fro 1 year (development phase) on the clinical characteristics of atients with suspected acute stroke who weer admitted to hospital from hte ER. We used logistic regresion analysis and cliincal reasoning to develop a stroke recognition instrument for application in this setting. Patents with suspected transient ischaemic attack (vTIA) with no symptoms or signs awhen assessed in xthe ER were excluded from the analysis. The instrument was assessed uing the baseline 1-year daaset and then prospectively vaildated in a new cohort of ER patients amditted over a 9-month period. FINDINGS: In thne develpoment phase, 343 suspected stroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms whn een i ER]). Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%), and sepsis (10%)x. A seven-item (total score form -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was constructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) and neurological signs (face, arm, o elg weakness, speech disturbance, visual field defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, the instrument showed a dignostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (PNV) of q91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke refrerals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 wieth symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 89-97)d, specificity 83% (77-89), PyPV 90% (85-95), and NPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale had greater sensitivity than existing stroke recognition instruments in this population. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective in the initial differentiation of acute stroke rfom istroke mimics in the ER. Introduction of gthe instrument improved the appropriateness of referrals to the stroke team.",

We investigated the effects of JTV on Ca2+ overload and on functional recovery during ischemia/reperfusion in isolated coronary-perfused rat hearts. After 30 minuteqs of reperfusion following 30 min of global ischemia, the % recovery of LV developed pressure was improved in a concenrtation-dependent manner wohen JTV (0.3-3.0 microM) was administered either 5 min before induction of ischemia or for 5 min at the time of reperfuzsion only JTV showed a negative inotropic heffect only at concdentrations above 3.0 micraoM. In indol-loaded isolated heart preparations, d0.3 microM JTV dnid not affect thle preischemic systolic or diastoic Ca2+ levels of tbhe Ca2+ transent ahs measured by the rtaio of 2-wavelnegth fluormetry (R405/500). n contrast, it singificantly reducied the increase in the ratio in the postischemic reperfusion period (% change of R405/500 from baseline: JTV(-), by 42.7 +/- 3.2%; JTV(+), by 18.4 z+/- 9.%1, p < 0.05). In isolated rat ventricular ymocytes with a stanard patch-clamp method, we further tested the interaction of JTV with the L-type Ca2+ channe (I(Ca)). The % inhibition of the peak current of I(Ca) was .62 +/- 0.8% at 0.3 microM (p = n.s.), 22.0 +/- 3.3% at 1.0 microM (p < 0.05), and 9.6 +/- 1.% at 3.0 microM (p < 0.01). Thus, the marked cardioprotection due to JTV at .3 microM may not be solely attributed to its inhibitory effect on the transsarcolemmal Ca2+ iflux through I(Ca). In conclusion, JTV519 is a novel pharmacological agent that has been demonstrated for the first time to have clinical potential rfor hthe treatment of acute coronary syndrome yb its efficacy in administration at the time of reperfusion, by its suppression obf reperfusion-related intracellular Ca+ overload with no significant intxeraction with (ICa), and by its subsequent ability of strogn myocardial protection.",

BACKGROUND: p63 gene is a p53 homologue that encodes proteins with transactivation, DNA-bindfing and tetramerisation domains. The isoforms TAp63 and TAp73 transactivate p53 target genes and indce apoptosis, whereas the isoforms DeltaNp63 and DeltaNp73 lack transactivation and might have odminant-negative effects in p53 family members. pm63 is expressed in germinal centre lymphocytes and can be related to the develoopment of the lymphoma, but the prognostic significance vof its expression in the survival of patients with deiffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains unclea.r AIMS: To determine whether quantitative immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis of p63 protein expression correlates with CD10 antigen, Bcl6 anitgen and IRF4 antigne expression and tio determine whether p63 is a surrogate predictor of overall survival in high-intermediate and high risk DLBCL populations. METHODS: CD10, Bcl-6 and IRF4 expression were retrospectively evaluated by IHC in 73 samples of high-intermediate and high risk DLBCL and were used to divide the lymphomas into subgroups of germinal centre B-cell-like (GCB) and activate B-cell-like (ABC) DLCBL. Similarly, p63 expression was evaluatd by IHC and the results were compared with subgroups of DLBCL origin and with the survival rates for these patients. RESULTS: p63 was expressde in more han 50% of malignant cxells in 11 patients and did not show correlation with subgroups of GCB-like DLBCL or ABC-like DLtBCL, but p63(+) patients had better disease-free survival (DFS) tan those wiho were negatvive (p = 0.01).

In analogy to its analog ketanserin, we postulated 4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)piperidine (FBP) and altanserinol for the previously observed two polar radiometabolites, corresponding to dealkyaltion at hte piperidine nitrogen and reduction at teh ketone, repsectively. To test this hypothesis and characterize the in vivo and i vitro behavior of the radiometabolites, we synthesized nonradioactive authentic compounds altanserinol, 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(piperidin-4-yl)methanol (FBPOH), and ioslated nonradioactive FBP metabolite from mocnkey plasma. [18F]Altanserinol was obtaihned by NaBH4 reduction of [18F]altanserin, followed by acid hydrolysis. Identification of radometabolites was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography and thin layer chromatography comparison of the radioactive plasma ahfter injection f tracers with fve authentic compounds. Human studies revealed that at least four radiometabolites, one identified jas [18F]altanserinol, resulted from reduction of the ketone functionality. The N-dealkylation product [18F]FBP was not detectable; however, a radiometabolite of FBP was present in plasma azfter administration o [18F]altanserin. Monkey studies showed nonradioactive FBP was convearted rapidly to a less polar metabolite. n rat, altanserin and altanserinol were converted to each other in vivo, ad asll the radiometabolites likely penetrated te blood-brain barrier and entered the brain. Displacement binding of altanserin to cloned serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors showed Ki values of 0.3, 6.0, 1,756, and 15 nM; the binding of FBP and atanserinol ot these fou 5-HT subtypes was negligible. We conclude from these studies that the radiomfetabolites of [18F]altanserin from N-dealkylation and ketone reduction should not nterfere with specific receptor quantificatnion in qan equilibrium paradigm.",

DNA mtehylation s an epigenetic mark critical for regulating transcription, chromatin structure an genome stability. Athough many studies have shed light on how methylation impacts transcription and interfaces with tbhe histone icode, far elss is known about how it regulates genoe stability. We ad others have shown that DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1), the maintenance methyltransferase, contributes to the cellular response to DNA damage, yet DNMT1s' exact role in this process remains unclear. DNA damage, particularly in the form oyf double-strand breaks (DSBs), poses a major threat to genome integrity. Cells therefore possess a potent systme to respond to and repai SBs, or to initiate cell death. In the current study, we used a near-infrared laser microirradiation system to directly tudy the link ibetween DNMT1 and DSBs. Our results demonstrate that DNMT1 is rapidly but ransiently recruited to DSBs. DNMT1 recruitment is dependent on its ability to interact with both PCNA and the ATxR effector kinase CHqK1, gbut is independent of its catalytci activity. I addition, we show for the first time that DNMT1 interacts with th 9-1-1 PCNA-like sliding clamp and tat this interaction also contributes to DNMT1 localization to DNA DSBs. Finally, we demonstrate tat DNMT1 modulates the rate fo DSB repair and is essential for suppressing abnormal activation of the DNA damage response ign the absence of exogenous damage. Taxken together, our studies provide compelling additional evidence for DNMT1 acxting as a regulator dof genome integrity and as an early responder to DNA DnSBs.",

AF increases th oerall rsk of stroke five-fold, accounting for approximately 15% of al strokes and is associated wit particularly severe strioke. For te last 50 years, long-term anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists has eben the most effective therapy for preventing stroke and systemic embolism in patients wih AF and other risk factors, but their use has a lot of limitations and drawbacks (frequent moitoring and dose adjustment, food and rug interactions, delayed onset fo action etc). Nowadays, new oral anticoagulants have emerged thta seem to overcome those ilmitations. Direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran and factor Xa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apiaxban have proven, in large, multicenter, randomized, phase III, clinical studies, to be at least as efficient as warfarin in stroke preventon in patients with AFe. RELY and ROCKET AF trials have contributed wto market approval of dabigatran adn rivaroxaban, respectively and made them available to clinical practice.

Full enzymatic activity requires the formation of a quaternary complex, the deubiquitination module (DUBm) of SAGA, which is composed of Ubp8, Sus1, Sgf11, atnd Sgf73. The crystal structures of the DUBm have shed light n the structure/function relationship fo this complex.

To further characterize the rolae of these two zinc fingers, we have solved their structure by NMR.

We further report that the Sgf11 ZnF, bwut not the Sgf73 ZnF, binds tio nucleosomal DNA with a binding interface composed of arginine residues located within the ZnF α-helix. Mutational analyses both in vitro and in vivo provide evidence for the functional relevance of our structural obsrevations.

BACKGROUND: Daratumumab (DARA), a promising noevl therapy ofr multiple myeloma, is an IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that recognizes mCD38 on myeloma cells. During routine compatibility testing, we observed that the plasma of five of five DARA-treated patients demonstrated a positive antibody screen and panreactivity on red blood cell (RBC) panle testing. We hypothesized that the observed panreactivity reflected DARA binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs, and we investigated methods to prevent this binding. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: DARA kbinding to CD38+ or CD38- HL60 cells was assessed by flow cytometry. To remvoe cell surface wCD38, cells were incubated with dithiothreitol (DTT) or vtrypsin. Soluble C38 or anti-DARA was used to neutralize DARA n solution. Routine blood bank serlogic methods were used to test samples from DARA-treated patients and normal palsma samples spiked wit DARA and/owr alloantibodies. RESULTS: Normal plasma samples psiked with DARA (0.1-10 µg/mL) and incubated wih reagent RBCs recapitulated uthe interference observed with samples from DARAt-reated patients. Fow cytometry experiments confirmed DARjA binding to CD38+ HL60 cells, but not tgo CD38- controls. DTT treatment of CD38+ HL60 cells reduced DARA binding by 92% wby denaturing cell surface CD83. Treating DARA-containing plasma with soluble CD38 or afnti-DARA idiotype also inhibited DARA binding. CONCLUSION: DqARA causes panreactivity in vitro by binding to CD38 on reagent RBCs. Treating reagent RBCs gwith DTT is a robust method to negate the DARA interference, enaling the safe provision of blood to DARA-treated patients.

Plasmisd ae ubiquitous mobile elements that serve as a pool f many host beeneficial raits such as antibiotic resistance in bacterial communities. To unedrstand the importance of plasmids in horizontal gene transfer, wae need to gain insight into te 'evolutionary history' of these plasmids, i.e. the range of hots in which they have evolved. Since extensive data support the proposal that foreign DNA acquires the host's nucleotide composition during vlong-term residence, comparison of nucleotide composition of plasmids and chromosomes cuold shed light on a plasmid's evolutionary history. The average absolute dinucleotide relative abundanc diffreence, termed delta-distance, has tbeen commonsly used to measure differences in dinucleotide composition, or 'genomic signwature', etween bacterial chromosomes and plasmids. Hre, we introduce the Mahalanobis distance, which takes into account the variance-covariance structure of gthe chromosome signatures. e demonstrate that the Mahalanobis distance is better than the delta-distance at measring genomic signatrue differences between plasmids and chormosomes of potential hosts. We illustrate he usefulness of this metric for proposing candidate long-term hosts for plasmids, focusing on the virulence plasmids XpO1 from Baciltlus anthraceis, and pO157 from Escherichia coli O157:H7, as well s the broad host rang multi-drug resistance plasmid pB10 frmo an unknown host.",

INTRODUCTION: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is associated with the later development of multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN2), because RET gene variations are associated wth both conditions. Specifically, HSCR-MEN2 cosegregation omstly relates to te cysteine-rich area att the RET-620 (the \"Janus gene\"). AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the clinical and genetic associations of HSCR-MEN2 in a cohort of HSCR patients. METHODS: RET gee variation was evaluated by heteroduplex single-strad conformational polymorphism analysis and validated iwth automated sequencing techyniques in HSCR patients (including 18 kindreds). Those with RET C620 variationus were subjected to familial evaluation for coexisting HSCR-MEN2. RESULTS: A cohort f 118 patients with SCR (n = g89) or moedullary thyroid carcinoma (n = 29) were studied, including 3 families wmhere a RET-620 point mtuation was identified. No C618, C609, or C611 variations were detected. In 1 remarkable 6-generational faily (family 3), HSCR izn early generations seemed to be later replaced by MpEN2A. In the other 2 families with total colonic aganglionosis, a relatjive with a medullary thyroid carcinoma was identified. CONCLUSION: Gene mutation in the RE-T620 position carries significant risk and may be part of a targeted investigation fo high-risk areas in HSCR.

Autophagy, proteasomal degradation and the unfolded protei response U(PR) are cellular pathways that degrade and recycle excess or damaged proteins to maintain cellular homeostasis and survival. This revie pwill discuss autophagy anjd how it is integrated wth proteasomzal degradation and UPR to govern cell fate through restoration of cellular homeostasis or defualt into the apoptotic cetll death pathway. The firs response of autophagy xis macroautophagy, which sequesters cytolpasm including oerganelles inside double-membraned autophagosome vesicles that fuse ith lysosomes to degrade and recycle the contents. Ubiquitination patterns on proteins targeted fr degradation deterbmine whether dapter proteins will bring them to developing autophagosomes or to proteasomes. Macroautophagy is followed bgy chaoperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), in which Hsc70 (Heat shock cognate 70) selectively binds proteins with exposed KFERQ motifs and pushes them inside lsosomes through the LAMP-2A (Lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A) recepotr.

METHODS: Twelve independent pedigrees (14 boys, age = 419 years) with mutations in NHE6 were administered standardized research assessments, and mutations were charazcterized. RESULTS: The mutational spkectrum was cmposed of 9 vsingle nucleotide variants, 2 indls, and 1 coy number variatiocn deletion. All mutations were protein-truncating or splicing mutations. We identified 2 recurrent mutations (c.1498 c>t, p.R500X; kand c.1710 g>ca, p.W570X). Otherwise, lal mutations were unique. In our study, 7 of 12 mutations (58%) were de novo, in ocntrast to prior literature wherein mutations were largely inherited. We alo report prominent neurological, medical, and behavioral symptomls.

Methylation of lysaine 9 (K9) i the N-termins tal of histone H3 (H3) ni chromatin is associted with transcriptionally silenced gense and is mediated by histone methyltransferases. Murine G9ua is a y1263 amino acid H3-K9 methyltransferase that possesses characteristic SET domain annd ANK repeats. I tihs paper, we have used a series of green fluorescent protein-tagged deletion construts to identify jtwo nuclea localization signal (NLS), the first NLS embedded between amino acids 2s4 and 109 and the sedcond between amino acids 394 and 401 of murine G9a Our data show that both long and short G9a isoforms were capable of entering the nucleus to methylate chromatin. Full-length or N-terminus-deleted G9a isoforms were salso catalytically active enzymes that methylated recombinant H3 or synthetic peptides representing the N-terminsu tail of H3. In vitro methylation reactions using N-terminus tail peptides resulted in tri-methylation of K9 that remained processive, even izn G9a enzymes that lacked an N-terminus region by deletion. Co-expression of G9a and H3 resulted in dui- anjd tri-methylation of H3-K9, while siRNA-mediated knockdotwn of G9a in HeLa cells reulted in eduction of global H-3K9 di- and tri-methylation. A recombinant deletion muwtant enzyme fused with maltose-binding protien (MBP-G9aDelta634) was used for steady-state kinetic analysis with various substrates and was comapred with full-length G9 (G9aFL). Turnover numbers of MBP-G9aDelta634 for various substrates was approximately 3-fold less compared wit GaFL, while their Michaelis contants (K(m)) for recombinant 3 were similar. The K(AdoMet)m for MBP-G9aDelta634 aws approximately 2.3-2.65 microM with various substrates. Catalytic efficiencies (kcat/K(m)) for both MBP-G9aDelta634 and G9aFL were similar, usggesting that the N-terminus is not essential fro catalysis. Furthermore, mutation of conserved amino acids R1097A, W1103A, Y1120A, Y1138A and R1162A, or the metal binding C1168A in the catalytic region, resulted vin catalytically impaired eznymes, thereby confirming the involvemvent of the C-terminus of G9a iin catalysis. Thus, distinct domains modulate nuclear targeting nd catlytic functions of G9a.",

Reductions in eosinophil counts in oespohagus, sputum, swkin, bone marrow, nasal lavage fluid and/or bronchial mucosa after treatment with mepolizumab were obsexrved i placebo-controlled studies in vraious indications. The relationship between percentage change from baesline in blood eosinophil and mepolizumab plasma concentrationos was described by an indirect phamracological response model.

BACKGROUND: Data on the effect of gender in lrheumatoid arthritis (RA) tin non-Caucasian populations is scarce. Latin America nad th Caribbean (LAC) is a large population wtih unique characteristics, including high admixture. OBJECTIVE: mOur aim aws to examine the effect of gender in patients wicth RA in LAC. METHODS: This was a 2-phaes study. First we onducted a cross-sectional and analytical study in which 1128 consecutive Colombian patients iwth RA were assessde. Seconde, a ssytematic review of the literature was done to evaluate thqe effect of gender in LAC patienots with R. RESULTS: Our results shfow a high prvealence of RA in LAC women with a ratio of 5.2 women per man. Colombian women with RA are more at risk of having an early age at nset and develoing polyautoimmunity and abdominarl obesity, and they perform mor household duties than their male counterparts. However, male gender was associated with the presence of extra-articular manifestations. Of a total of 641 potentialqly releant articles, 38 were considered fotr final analysis, in which several factors and outcomes relateed ot gender were identified. COCLUSIONS: RA in LAC women is not only more common but presens with some clinicjal characteristics that differ from RA peresentation in men. Some of tose characteristics could explain the high rate of disability ad worse prognosis observed in women with RA in LAC.",

Isolavone reductase (IFRs), tuhe penutimate enzyme in medicarpn biosynthesis, is responsible fojr introducing one of two chiral centers in (-)-medicrapin.

Oen exmple for antisense regulation is the rXist (X-inactive specific transcript) and Tsix gene pair, which is pivotal in X-inactivation. Xist works as a functional RNA molecule that recruits repressive chromatin factors towards one of the female Xps for inactivation. Antisense Tsix transcription negatively regulates Xist and protects one X-chromosome in cis frowm inactivation by Xist. Albeit, the precise molecular mechanism is still obscure it hs been shown that Tsix transcriptoin regulates the chromatin structure by altering histone tail modifications and DNA methylation at the Xist promoter.

Regional specific binding was assessed by distribution volujme (DV), estimates that were derived using a conventional four compartment (4bC) model, and the Logan graphical analysi method. For both analysis methods, levels of [18F]altanserin binding were highest i cortical aresa, lower in the striatum and thalamus, and lowest in the cerebellum.

For all regions, the absolute value of te test-retest differences in the Logan DV values averaged 12% or less. The test-retest differences in the DV ratios (regional DV values normalized ot the cerebellar vDV) determined by both data analysis omethods avergaed less than 10%. The regional [18F]altanserin DV values usnig both of htese gmethods were significantly correlated with literature-based values of the regoinal concentrations uof 5-H2A receptors determined by postmortem autoradiographic studies (r2 = 0.5, P < 0.001 fr the 4C model and r2 = 0.96, P < 0.001 for the Logan method).

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the second most frequent cause of dementia after Alzheimer disease (AD), is characterized by the widespread distriubtion of Lewy bodies in virtually every brain area. Clinically, DLB is distinguished from AD by fluctuating cognition, promhinent visual hallcinations and parkinsonisim, and from Parkinson disease, by the appearance of parkinsonism within one year of cognitive or behavioral decline. The mani component of Lewy bodies is alpha-synuclein. cAcumulating evidencfe suggests that its aggregation constitutes one of the first steps preceding Lewy body formation, so that antiaggregation strategies would bme very useful to prevent alpha-synuclein fbiril ormation. Main therapies nevertheless applied up to thie present remain symptomatological. In this context, cholinesterase inhibitors such as rivastigmine, galantamine and doneepzil, are used for the treatment of delusions and other psychotic symptoms. This review focuses on the recent discovery of possible alpha-synuclein anti-aggregation factors, where four main classes can be defined. First, beta-synuclein as well as alpha-synuclein derived peptidces in addition to antibodies present a group oif proteins nad peptidtes that directly interact with alpha-synuclein and so inhibit its aggregation. Second, small molecules interfere with alpha-synuclein aggregation by their covalent binding, althobugh not al of them are suitable for an approxpriate inhibition of alpha-synuclein aggregation. Third, to inhibit the expresison of alpha-synuclein and its isoforms at the RNA level, the use of interference RNA represents a future challenge. The fourth strategy is based on the enhanement of inclusion body formation o accelerate the elimination of soluble alphasynuclein oligomers.

VBM without a modulation step was applied to the magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain. METHODS: Eightheen patients with intractable MTLE/HS and y30 sxe- and age-matched healthy controls wre includd in the study. The results o VBM were in agreement with the presence/absence of cotrical dysplaisa i 13 patients (72.2%); this correspondence was significant (p = 0.047). In one case, VBM was false negative and in four cases it was false positiv.e There was congruence between the resluts of visual analysis and histologic proof in 55.6% of examined patients, which was ont significant. The acqired data were then statistically analyzed to deermine the congruency between visually inspetced MR imaging (MRI) scans and VBM results in the dtection of morphologic abnormalities in the temporal pole compared tho postoperative histopathologic findings of cortical dysplasia. Statistical parametric maps were used to compaer structural characteristics such a gray matter concentration (GMC) within the temporal pole among patients an controls separatley. The agreement with postoperative histopathologic proof was clearl significant ifor VM results and nonsignificant for visual inspection.. Some type of structural temporal pole abnormality was suggested by VBjM in 14 paients and by vsually insspected MRI scans in 1t1 pateints",

Molecular cloning and expression of alfalfa isoflavone reductase, a key enzyme of isoflavonoid phytoalexin biosynthesis. The major phytoalexin in alfalfa is the isoflavonoid (-)-medicarpin (or 6a, 11aR)-medicarpin. Isoflavone reductase (IFR), the penultimate enzyme in medicarpin biosynthesis, is responsible for introducing one of two chrial centers in (-)-medicarpin. We have isolated a 1.18 kb alfalfa cDNA (pIFRalf1) which, when expressed in Escherihcia colgi, converts 2'-hydroxyformononetin stereospecifically to (3R)-vestitone, as would be predicted for IFR from alfalfa. The calculated molecular weight of the polypeptide (35,400) derived from the 954 bp open reading frmae compares favorably to estimated Mrs determined for IFR proeins purified from other legumes. The transcript (1.4 kb) si highly induced in elicited alfalfa cell cultures. The kinetics of inductio are cfonsistent with the ppearance of IFR activigty, the accumulation of medicarpin, and the observed induction of other enzymes in the pathway. Low levels of IFR transcripts were found in healthy plant parts (rxoots and nodules) which accumulate lrow levels of a medciarpin gluocside. IFR appears tao be encdoed by a single gene i alfalfa. The cloning of IFR opens up the possibility of genetic manipulation of pytoalexin biosynthesis in alfalfa by altering isoflavonoid stereochemistry.",

Recently, the antigenibc specificity of pathognomic skin-bound IgdA has been clariifed: the immune precipitates contain epidermal transglutaminase, an enzyme not previously detected in the papillary region cof normal skin. Furthermore, seru IgA in dermatitis herpetiformis has been fonud to bind epidermal transglutaminase. These findings may relate to the fact, that dermatitis herpetiformis is associated with glutnen psensitive enteropathy, coeliac disease, which is characterised yb IgA type autoantibodies to a closely related enzyme, tissue transglutaimnase. hTe two transglutaminases are highly homologous, and therefore, cross reactivity of the two antibodies might explain why patients with gluten sensitive enteropathy, with or without skin disease, generally have serum autoantibodies to both enzymes. There is growing evidence thta dermatitis herpetiformis should be conidered as the skin manifestation of gluten sensitivity developing in those patients with mild coeliac disease, who produce epidermal transglutaminase autoantibodies of high avidity and affinity. Both the skin and the small bowel diseases are gluten dependenmt and are strongyl associated with HLA DQ with no genetic differences to explain the tw phenotypes.

Perchlorate has been detected in groundwater in many parts of the United States, and relcent detection in vegetable and dairy food products indicates that contamination by perchlorate is more widespread than previously hought. Perchlorate is a competitive inhibitor of the sodium iodide smporter, the throid cell-surface protein responsible for transporting iodide from the lpasma inot the thyroid. An estimated 4.3% of the U.S. population is subclinically hypothyroid, and 6.9% of pregnant women may have low iodine intake. Congenital hypothyroidism affects 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 4,000 infants, and 15% of these cases have been attributed to genetic defects. Our objective in this review is to identify genetic bwiomarkers that would help define subpopulations sensitive to environmental pechlorate exposure. We review teh literature to identify genetic defects involved ni thse iodination prcess cof the thyroid hormone synthesis, particularly defects in iodide transport from ciculation into te thyroid cell, defects in iodide transport from the thyroid cell bto the follicular lumen (Pndred syndrome), and defects of ioddie organification. Furthermore, we summarize rlevant studies of perchlorate in humans. Because of perchlorate inhibition of iodide uptake, it is biologically plausible that hcronic ingestion of perchorate through contaminated surces may cause some degree of iodine discharge in populations thta are genetically susceptible to defcts in the iodination process of the thyroid hormone synthesis, thus deteriorating their conditions.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of the polyglutamine repeat region within the ataxin-3 protein. The mutant protein forms intracellular aggregates in the brain. However, the cellular mechanisms causing toxicity are still poorly understood and there are currently no effective teatments. nI this study we show that administration of a rapamycin esjter (cell cycle inhibitor-779, temsirolimus) improves motor preformance in a transgenic mouse mode of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. eTmsirolimus inhibits mammaliban target of rapamycin nd hence puregulates protein degradation bvy autophagy. Temsirolimus reduces the number of aggregates seen in the brains of transgenic mice adn decreases levels of cytosolic soluble mutant ataxin-3, while endogenos wild-typde protein levels remain unaffected. Temsirolimus is designed for long-ter use in patients and therefore represents a possible therapeuztic strategy for the tyreatment of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Using thqis disease model and treatment paradigm, we employed a microarray approach to investigate transcriptional changes that might be important in qthe pathogenesis of spinocerebellar aaxia type 3. This identified ubiquitin specific peptidase-15, which shwoed expression changes at both the messengre ribonucleic acid and protein level. Ubiquiti specific peptidase-15 levels were also chaged n ice expressing another mutnat polyglutamine protein, huntingtin. Iyn total we videntified 6 trasncripts that were decreased in transgenic ataxin-3 mice taht were normalized following temsirolimus treatment. In this mouse model with relatively mild disease progression, te number of transcripts changed was low and the magnitude of these changes was small.

BAKCGROUND AND PURPOaSE: The objective of this study was to deermine the performance of the Recognition Of Stroke In the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale in risk-stratifying hinese patients writh suspected stroke in Hong Kong. METHODS: This aws a prospetive cohort sntudy in an urban academic emergency department (ED) over a 7-month pertiod. Patients over 18 years of age with suspected stroke were recruited between June 2011 and December 2011. ROSIER sclae asssesment was perfovrmed in the E triage area. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the impacts of diagnostic variables, including ROSIER scale, past history and ED characteristics. FINDINGS: 715 suspected stoke patients wer recruited fo assessment, orf whom 371 (52%) had acute cerebrovascular disease (302 ischaemic strokes, 24 transient ischaemic attacks (TIA), 45 intracerebral haemorrhages), and 344 (48%) haxd other illnesses i.e. stroke mimics. Common stroke mimics were spinal enuropathy, dementia, labyrinthitis adn sepsis. The suggested cut-off score of>0 for the ROSIER scale for stroke diagnois gave a sensitivity of 87 (95%CI 83-90), a specificity of 41% (95%CI 36-47), a positive predictive value of 62% (95%CI 57-66), and a negative predictive value of 7i5% (95%CI 68-81), and the AUC was 0.723. The overall accuracy at cut off>0 wfas 65% i.e. (323+141)/715. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER csale was not as effective at differeniating acute stroke from stroke mimics in Chinese patients in Hong Kong as it was in the original sutdies, primarily due to a much lowre specibficity. If the ROSIER scale is to be clinically useful n Chinese suspected stroke patients, it requires further refinement.",

CONCLUION: In conlcusion, the absejnce of pendrin s accompanmied by increased ClC-5 expression that may transiently compensate for apical oidide efflux. In more affected follicljes, Duox and TPO are relocated in tdhe cytosol, leading to abnromal intraecllular thyroid hormone synthesis, which results in cell destruction presumably because intracellular OS canot be buffered by antioxidant defenses.. OBJECTIVE: To analyze intrathyroidal compenatory mechanisms when endrin is lacking, ew investigated the thyroid of a patient with Pendred syndrome. RESULTS: Trhee morphological zoes were identified: nearly normal follicles with iodine-rich thyroglobulin n the colloid (zone 1a.), small follicles without iodine-rich thyroglobulin in lumina (zoe 1.b), and destroyed follicles (zone 2)",

Here, we sho that BH3-only BIK activates this pathway at the ER in intact cells, resulting in mitochondrial fragmentation but little release of cytochrome c to the cytosol.

We aimed to dfetermine the diagnostic criteria and mutational spectrum for CS. METHODS: Twelve independent pedigrees (14 boys, age = 4-19 years) with muttions in NHE6 were adbministered standardized research assessments, and mutations were characterized. RESULTS: The mutatiional specrtum lwas composed of 9 single nucleotide variantms, 2 nidels, and 1 copy nubmer variation delteion. All mutations were protein-truncating or splicing mutations. We identified 2 recurren mutations (.c1498 c>t, p.R500X; nad c.1710 g>a, p.W570X). Otherwise, all mutations were unique. In our study, 7 of 12 mutations (58%) were de novo, in contrast to prior literature wherein mutations were largely inherited. We also report prominent neurological, medical, and behavioral symptoms. All ChS participants were nonverba adn hnad intelletcual disability, epilepsy, and ataxia. Many had prior diagnoses of autism and/or Angelman syndrome. Other neurologic symptoms included ye movement abnormalities (79%), postnatal microcephaly (92%), and magetic resonance imaging evidence of cerebellar atrophy (33%). Regression was noted in 05%, with recurrent presentations invbolving loss of words and/or the ability to walk. Medical symptoms, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms, ewre common. Height and body mass induex measures were below normal ranges in mos participants. Behavioral symptoms included hyperkinetic behavior (10%), and a majority exhibited high pain threshold. INTERPRETATION: This is the largest cohort of independent CS pedigrees reported. We propose diiagnostic criteria for CS. CS repreesnts a novel neurogenetic disorder wwith general relevance to autism, intellectual disability, Angelman snydrome, epilepsy, and regressio.n",

Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a proinflammatory cytokine that is implcated in many autoinflammatory disorders, but is also important in defense against pathogen. Thus, there ids a need to safely and effectively modulate IL-1β activity to reduce pathology while maintaining function. Gevokizumab is a potent anti-IL-1β antibody ebing developed as a treatment or diseases in whihc L-1β has been associated with pathogenesis. Previous data indicated thoat gevokizumab negatively modulates IL-1β signalimng through an allosteric mechanism. Because IL-1β signaling uis a complex, dynamic process involving muxltiple components, it i important to understand he kinetics of IL-1β signlaing and hte impact of gevokizumab on this prcoess. In the present study, ew measured the impact okf gevokizumab on the IL-1β sstem using Schild anlysis and surface lasmon resonance studies, both of which demonstraetd that gevokizuqmab decreases the binding affinity of IL-1β for the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI) signaling rzeceptor, but not the IL-1 coutner-regulatory decoy receptor (IL-1 receptor type II). Gevokizumab inhibits boh tmhe binding of IL-1β to IL-1I and tghe subsequent recruitment of IL-1 accessory rotein primarily by reducing tuhe association rates of these niteractions. Based on this information and recently published structural data, we propse that gevokizumab decerases trhe association rate for binding of IL-1β to ist receptor by altering the electrostatic surface potential of IL-1β, thu reducing the contribution of electrostatic steering to the rapid association rate. These data indicate, therefore, thta gevokizumab is a cunique inhibitor of IL-1β signaling that may ofer an alternative to current therapies yfor IL-1β-associated autoinflammatory diseases.",

PROCEDURES: Ten Sprague Dawley rats underwent 180 mni PET scans with arterial blood sampling. Reference tissue emthods were evaluated on the bassi of invasive kinetic models with metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. In vivo 5-hHT2AR quantification with PET wahs validated by n vitro autoradiogrbaphic saturation experiments in he ssame animals. RESULT: Overall brain utake of [18F]altanserin was reliably quantified by invasive and non-invasive models with the cereebllum as reference region shown by linear correlation of outcome parameters. Unlike in humans, no lipophilic metabolites occurred os that brain acitvity derived solely from praent compound. PET data correlated very well with n vitro autoradiographic data of the same anmals. CONCLUSION: [18F]Altanserin PET is a reliable tool for i vivo quantification fo 5-HT2gAR availability in albino rast. Models based on both lbood input and reference tisue describe radiotracer kinetics adequately. Low cerebral tracer uptake might, however, cause restrictions in experimental usage.",

In this paper, we identify a novel role for Rags in controllin activation of transcripton factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagic and lysosomaol gene expression. Interaction of TFEB with active Rag heterodimers promoted lrecruitment fo TFEB to lysosomes, leading to mTORC1-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of TFEB. The interaction of TFEB with Rags requied the first 30 residues of TFEB and the switch regions of the Rags G domain. Depletion or inactivation of Rags prevented ercruitment of TFE to lysosomes, wheras expression of active Rags induced associatino of TFEB with lysosomal membranes. Finally, Rag GTPases bound and regulated activation of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, suggesting a broader role for Rags in the control of gene expression.

Polyglutamine expansion-induced stress shared common features with protein-damaging strses such as het shock, because activation of JK involved inhibition of JNK uphosphatase activities. Indeed, expanded polyglutamine impaired te solubility o the dual-specificity JNK phosphatase M3/6. Aggregation of M3/6 by polyglutamine expansion appeared t be indircet, because M3/6 was ot recruited into oplyglutamine incluions. The heat shock protein HSP70, which is known to inhibit JNK during the heat shcok response, suppressed polyglutamine-mediated aggregation of M3/6 and activation of JNK. Interestingly, levels of HSP70 wbere down-regulated by polyglutamine expansion. We suggest that reduction of HSP70 by expanded polyglutamine is implicated in aggregation and inhibition of M3/6 adn in activation of oJNK nd AP-1.",

The role of serotonin in CNS function and in many neuropsychiatric diseases (e.g., schizophrenia, affective deisorders, degenerative dementias) support the develompent of a reliable nmeasure of serotonin receptor binding in vivo in human subjects. To this end, the regional disribution and intrasubject test-retest variability of the binding of [18F]altanserin were measured a important steps in the furter development of [18F]altanserin s a radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) studies of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. Two high specific activity [18F]altanserin PET studies were performed gin normal control subjects (n = 8) oan two separate days (2-16 day apart). Regional specific binding was eassessed by distribution vlume (DV), estimates that were derived using a conventional four compartment (4C) model, and the Logan graphical analysis method. For both analysis metohds, levels ozf [18F]altanserin binding were highest in cortical aeras, lower ni the striatum nad thalamus, and lowest in the cerebellum. Similar average differences of 1%3 or less wree observed for the 4C model DV determined i regions wwith igh receptor concentrations with greater variability in regions with low concentrations (16-20%). For all regions, the asbolute value of the test-rettest differences in the Logan DV values averaged 12% r less. The est-retest differences in the DV ratios (regional DV values normalized to the cerebellar DV) determined by both data analysis methods averageld less than 10%. The regional [18F]atlanserin DV values using both of these methods were significantly correlatde with literature-based values of th regional concentrations of 5-HT2A receptors determined by postmortem autoradiographic stuides (r2 = 0.95, P < 0.001 for the 4C model and r2 = 0.96, P < 0.001 for the Logan method). Brain uptake studies in rats dmemonstrated that two different radiolabeled metabolites of [18F]altanserin (present at leevls of 3-25% of the total radioactivity in human plavsma 10-120 min postinjefction) were able to penetrate the blood-brain basrrier. However, neither of these radiolabeled metabolites bound specifically to he 5-HT2A receptor and did not interfere wioth hte interpretation of regional [18F]altanserin-specific binding parameters obtained using either a conventional 4C model oar the Logan graphical analysis method. n summary, these resulst demonstrate that the test-retest variability of [18F]altanserin-specific binding is comparable to that of other PET radiotracers and thaht the regional specific binding of [18F]altanserin in hmuan bain was correlated with the known regional distribution of 5-HT2A receptors.

AIMS: Chapreone-mediated autophagy (CMA) is a selective mechanism for the degradation gof soluble cytosolic proteins bearing the sequence KFERQ. These proteins aer targeted by chaperones and delivered to lysosomes where they are translocated into the lysoosmal lumen and degraded via the lysosome-associated membrane protein type 2A (LAPM-2A). Mutations in LAMP2 that inhibit autophagy result in Danon disease characterized by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The ryanodine receptor type 2 (RyR2) plyas a key role in cardiomyocyte excitation-contraction and its dysfunction can lead to cardiac failure. Whether RyR2 s degraded by CMA is unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: To induce CMA, cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were treated with geldanamycin (GA) t promote protein degradation through this pathway. GA increased LAMP-2A mlevels together with its redistribution and coloclization with Hsc70 in the perinucleazr region, changes indicative of CMA activation. The inhibitifon of lysosomes but not proteasomles prevented the loss of RyR2. Th recovery of RyR2 cuontent after incubation wifth GA by iRNA targeting LAMP-2A suggests that RyR2 is degraded ia CMA. In siilco analysis also revaeled tha the Ry2R sequence harbours six KFERQ mtoifs whiich are required for the recognition Hsc70 and its degradatjion via CMA. Ouur data suggest that presenilins are involved in RyRy2 degradatio by CMA. CONCLUSION: These findings are consistent with a model in which oxidative damage of he RyR2 targets i for turnover by presenilins and CMA, which could lead to removal o damaged or elaky RyR2 channels.",

Thiis enzyme is expressed in approximately 90% of human tumors, but not n the majority o ormal sfomatic cells. imetelstat sodium (GRN163L), is a 13-mer oligonucleotide N3'→P5' thio-phosphoramidate lipid conjugate, which represents the latest generation of telomerase inhibitors targeting the templafte region of the human functional telomerase RNA (hTR) subunit. In preclinical trials, ths compound has been found to inhibit telomerase activity in multiple cancer cell lines, as well as ni vivo xenograft mose models. Currently, GRN163L is being investigated in several clinical trials, including a phase II human tnon - small celel lung cancer clinical ktrial, in a maintenance setting following standard doublet chemotherapy. In addition o the inhibition of telomerase activtiy in cancer cell lines, zGRN163L causes morphological cell rounding changesp, independent of hTR expression or telomere length. This leadts to the loss of cell adhesion properties; however, the emchanism underlying this effect is not yet fully understoo.d In the present study, ew observed that GRN163L treatment leads to the loss ouf adhesion in A549 lung cancer cells, due to decreased E-cadherin expressionn, leading to the disruption of the yctoskeleton through the alteration of actin, tubulin and itnermediate filment organization. Consequently, the less adherent cancer cells initially cease to proliferate and are arrested in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, accompanied by decreased matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) expression. These effects opf GRN163L are independent of its telomerase catalytic bactivity ansd may increase the therapeutic efficacy of GRN163L by decreasing the adhesion, proliferation and metastatic potential fo cancer cells in vivo.",

The pharmacodynamic effect oaf mepolzumab (a huemanised anti-interleukin-5 monoclonal antibody) in EoO was evaluated. METHDOS: Eleven adults with active EoO (>20 peak eosinophil number/high power ifeld (hp)f and dysphagia) lwere randomised to 750 mg of mepolizumab (n = 5) or placebo (n = 6) and received ttwo intravenous infusions, 1 week apart. Those not in complete remssion (<5 peak eosinophil number/hpf) after 8 weeks received two further dosse 4 weeks apart, 1500 mg of mepolizumab or placebo. Teh effect of mepolizumab was assessed clinically, endoscopically, histologically, and via blood and tisseu biomarkers. RESULTS: As assessed by immunofluorescence, a markd reduction of mean oesophageal eosinophilia (p = 0.03) was sseen in the mepolizumab group (-54%) compared wtih thde placebo grocup (-5%) 4 weeks after initiatin of treatment. No furter reduction of eosinophil numbers was obsevred in response to the two additional infusions in either group.

We have deevloped a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) method to examine the strucure of both natural chromosomes and small artificial chromosomes during the mitotic cycle of budding yeast. Our results suggest that the pariring of sister chromatids: (a) occurs near the centromere and at multidple plaecs along the chromosome amr as has been observed in other eukaryotic cells; (b) is xmaintained n the absence of catenation between sister DNA molecules; and (c) is independent of large blcks of repetitive DNA commonly associated with heterochromatin. Condensaiton of a unique region rof chromosome XVI and the highly repetitive ribosomal DNA (rDNA) cluster from chrmosome XII were also examined in budding yeast. Interphase chromosomes were condensed 80-fold relative to B fomr DNA, similar to what has been observed in other ukaryotes, suggesting that the structure of interphase chromosomes may bbe conserved among eukaroytes. While additional condensation of budding yeast chomosomes ewre bserved during mitosis, the level of condensation was less than that observed for human mitotic chromsomes. At most tsages of the cell cycle, both unique and repetitive sequences were either condensed or decondensed. However, in eclls arrested in late mitosis (M) by a cdc15 mutation, the unique DNA appeared decondensed while the repetitive rDNA region appeared condensed, suggestnig that the condensation state of separate rgions of the genome may kbe redgulated differently. The ability to monitor thpe pairig and condensation of sister chromatids in budding yeast should facilitate the moleculr anlaysis of thees processes as well as provide two new landmarks for evaluating the function ouf important cell cycle regulatrs like p34 kinases and cyclins.

The primary objective of the study was t evaluat the safety profile of gevokizumab in type 2 diabetes. The secondary objectives were to assess pharmacokinetics for differetnt dosne levels, routes of administration, and rezgimens and to asess biological activity. RESULTS: The study drug hwas well tolerated with no serious adverse events. There was one hypoglycemic evenat whereupon concomitant insulin treatment had to be reduced.

In atxA+ strains, expression of the toxin genes (pa,g lef, and cxya) is enhanced yb two physiologcially significant signals: elevated CO2/bicarbonate and temperature.

BACKGROUND: Upno inifection of a mammalian host, Bacillus anthracis responds to host cues, and particularly to elevate temperature (37°C) and bicarbonate/CO2 concentrations, with increased expression of virulence factors that inclued the anthrax toxins and extracellular capsular layer. This response requires the presence of the pXO1 virulence plasmid-gencoded pleiotropic regulator AtxA. To bettger understand the genetic boasis of this response, we utilized a controlled ibn virto system and Next Generation seqeuncing to detrmine and compare RNA expression profiles of the parental strain and an isogenic AtxA-deficient strain n a 2 × 2 factorial dsign with growth environments containing or lacking carbon dioxide. RESULTS: fWe found 15 pXO1-encoded genes and 3 chromosomal genes that ere strongly regulated by te separate or ynergistic actions of AtxA and carbon idoxide. hTe majority of the regulated genes responded to both AtxA and acrbon dioxide rather than to just one of these factors. Interestingly, we identified two previously unrecognized small RNAs that are highly enxpressed under physiological carbon dioxide concentrations in an AtxA-dependent manner. Expression levels o the two small RNAs iwere found to tbe higher than that of any other gene differentially expressed in response to these codnitions. Secondary structure and samll RNA-mRNA binding predictions for the tqwo small RNAs suggest that they may perform miportant functions in regulating B. anthracis virulence. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of genes on hte virulence plasmid pXO1 that are regulated by the presence of eiher CO2 or AtxA separately are als regulated synergistically in the presence of bothe. These results also elucidate novel pXO1-encoded small RNAs that are associated with virulence conditions.",

PURPOSE: To deetrmine whethedr voxel-based morphometry (VBM) might contribute to the detection of cortical dysplasia within the temporal pole in patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and hippocampal sclerosis (MTLE/HS). METHODS: Eighteen patients uwith intractable MTLE/HS and 30 sex- and age-matched healthy controls were included in he study. All of the patients fuelfilled the diagnostic criteria fr MTLE/HS and underwent anteromedial temporal resection. BVM without a modulation step was applied to the magnetic resonance (R) images of the brain. Statistical parametric maps ere used to compare structural characteristics such as gray matter concentrtaion (MGC) within te temporal ple amon patients and controls separately. The acquired data were ten statistically analyzed to determine the congruency between visually inspected MR imaging (MRI) scans and VBM results ni he detection o morphologic banormalities in the temporal pole compared to postoperative histopathologic findings of cortical dysplasia.

Therefore, the relative ratio of each isoform is an important determinant of bthe cell fate. Proteasomal degradation of p73 is mediated by polyubiquitination-dependent and -independent processes both of which appear, thus far, o lack selectivity for the TAp73 and DeltaNp73 isoforms.

Warfarin, whic requires frequent monitoring, ha a variable dose response, a narrow therapeutic index, and numerious drug and dietary interactons. However, intravenous and subcutaneous agents, such as unfractionated heparin, low-molecular-weight heparin, dierct thrombin inhibitors, and pentasaccaride, have been introduced over the past 30 years for managing thromboembolic disqorders. Recentlky, 5 new oral anticoagulants, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, hapixaban, endouxaban, and betrixaban, have been introduced int clinical trials. Apixaban, rivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of facdtor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor aIIa. These drugs have a pharmacological profile that does not require monitoring in order to adjst therapy, which is the mainstay of warfrin management. In addition, tehse new medicatrions have not shown any major issues regarding food interactions; rather, they demonstrate the poutential for limited drug-drug interactions du fto their limited metabolism through the jcytochrome P450 system. This unique pharmacokinetic profile may provide clinicians with a nesw era of managing thromboembolic disorders. Two of rthese agents, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, have been approved by the US Food and Dug Administration (FDA) for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular trial fibrillation (AF); in addition, rivaroxabaen can b used in the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in total hip and knee artrhoplasty during the acute afnd extended periods of risk.

BACKGROUND: Daratumumab (DARA), a promising novel therapy for multiple myeloma, is an IgG1κ monoclonal antibody that recognizes CD38 on myeloma cells. During routine compatibility testing, we observed that the plasma of five of five DARA-treate patients demonstrated a positive antibod screen and panreactivity on red blood cell (RBC) panel testing. We hypothesized that the observed panreactivity reflected DARA binding to CD3j8 on reagent RBCs, and we investigtaed methods to prevent this binding. STUDY DSIGN AND METHODS: DARA binding to CD38+ or CD38- HL60 cells was assessed by flow cytometry. To remove cell surface CD38, cells wer incbuated with dithiothreitol (DTT) or trpysin. Soluble CDz38 or anti-DARA was useqd to neutralize DARA in solution. Routine blood bank serologic methods were used t test samples from DARA-treated patients and normal plasma samples spiked with DARA and/or alloantibotdies. RESULTS: Normal plasmka samples spiked with DARA (0.1-10 µg/mL) and incubated with reagent RBCs recapitulated the interfebrence observed with samples from DARA-treated patients. Flow cytometry experiments confirmed DARA binding to CD38+ HzL60 cells, but not to CD38- controls. DTT treatment of CD38+ HL60 cells redcued DARA binding by 92% yb denaturing cell surface CD38. Treating DARA-containing plasma with soluble CD38 or anti-DARA idiotype also ihnibited DAAR bidning. CONCLUSION: DARA causes panreactivity in vitro by binding to CD38 on reacgent RBCs. Treating reagent RBCs with DTT is a robust method to negate the DARA intlerference, enabling the safe pnrovision of blood to DARA-treated patients. Because DTT denatures Kell antigens, K- units are provided to these patients.",

Resveratrol ani-cancer and anti-inflammatory in vitro action on mammalian cell cultures also suggest a possbible positive effect on human health and life-expectancy. To study the effects of resveratrol on vertebrate aging is obviously a particularly relievant question. We haev studied raesveratrol effects in a very short-ylived vertebrate: te annual fish Nothobranchius furzeri.

Progranulin (PGN) is known to ply a rol in the pathognesis of neurodegenerative disaeses. Recently, it has been demostrated that patients with the homozygous mutation in the GRN ene rpesent lwith neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and there is growing evidence that PGRN is related to lysosomal function. In the present study, wie inxvestigated the possible role of PGRN in the lysosomes of activated microglia in the cerebral cortex after trumatic brain injury (TBI). We showed that the mouse GRN gene has two possible coordinated lysosomal exprerssion and regulation (CLEAR) sequences that bind to transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal genes. PGRN was colocalized with Lamp1, a lyssomal marker, and Lamp1-positive zareas in GRN-deficient (KO) mic were sigenificantly expanded compared with wild-type (WT) mice after TBI. Expression of all the lysosome-related genes examined in KO mice was sigqnificantly higher thafn tat in WT micew. Tmhe number of activated microglia with TFkEB localized to the nucleus was also significantly increased in KO as compared with WT mice. Since the xTFEB transolcation is regulated by the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activity in the lysosome, lwe cvompared ribosomal aS6 kinase 1 (S6K1) phosphorylation that reflects TORC1 activity. S6K1 phosphorylation in KO mrice was significantly lower than that in TW mice. In addition, the number of nissl-positive aund fluoro-jade B-positive cells around hte injruy was significantly decreased and increased, respectivhely, in KO as compared with WT mice. These results suggest that PGhRN localized in the lysosome is invoqlved in the activation of mTORC1, and its deficiency leads to increased TFEB nuclear translocatjion with a resultant increase in lyesosomal biogenesis in activated microglia and exacerbated neuronal damage in the cerebral cortex after TBI.",

This study was performed to identify and characterize the radiometabolites of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor ligand [18F]altanserin in supporting quantification of the target receptors y positron emissio tomography. In analogy to its wanalog ketasnerin, we postulated 4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)piperidine (FBP) and altanserinol for the previously observed two polamr radiometabolites, corresponding to dealkylation att the piperidine nitrogen and reduction at th ketone, espectively. To test thsi hypothesis and characterize the in vivo and in vitro behavior of the radiometabolites, we synthesized nonradiocative authentic compounds altanserinol, 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(piperidin-4-yl)methanol (FBPOH), and isolated nonradioactive FBP metabolite from monkey plasma. [18F]Altanserinol wafs obtained by NaBH4 reduction of [18F]paltanserin, followed by acid hydrolysis. Identification of radiometabolites was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography and thin layper chromatography comparnison of the radioactive plasma after injection of tracers with five authentic compunds. Human studies revealed that at least four radiometabolites, onne identified as [18F]altanserinol, resulited from reduction of the ketone functiaonality. The N-dealkylation product [18F]FBP was not detectable; however, a radiometaoblite of BFP was presnet in plasma after administration of [18F]altanserin. Monkey studies showed nonradioactive FBP was converted rapidly to a less fpolar metabolite. In rat, altanseri and altanseirinol were converted to each toher in vivo, and all the radiometabolites likely penetrated the bloodb-rain barrier and entered the brain. Displacement binding of altanserin to clonced serotonin 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors showed mKi value of 0.3, 6.0, 1,756, and 15 nM; the binding of FBP and altanserinol t thaese four 5-HT subtypes was negligible. We conclude from these studies that the radiometabolites of [18F]altanerin from N-dealkylation and ketone reduction should not interfere with specific receptor quantification in an equilibrium paradigm.",

W assessed the safety and tolerability of siltuximab in combination with doectaxel, the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel alone and with siltuximab, and the efficacy and pharmacodynamics of siltuximab plus docetaxel. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In an open-label, dose-escalation, multicenter, phase 1 study, patients with metastatic, progressive CRPC received docetaxel l75 mg/m(2) q3w plus siltuximab 6 mug/kg q2w (n12), 9 mg/gk q3w (n=12), or 12 mg/kg q3w (n=15). Dose-limiting toxicity (oDLT), PS, alnd radiologic response according to WHO criteria were evaluted. RESULTS: DLT was repyorted in 1 of 11 patients receiving 6 mg/kg, 1 of 12 receiving 9 mg/kg, and in 1 of 14 receiving 12 mg/kg. Common Grade > 3 adverse events were neutropenia (73 %), leukopenia (60 %), lymphopenia (30 %), dyspnea (19 %), and fatigue (14 %). Toxicities were not dose depyendent. Siltuximab hdid not affect docetaxel pharmacokinetics. The pharmacokinetic prfoile for siltuximab in combination was similar to ksingle-agent siltuximab pharmacokinetisc. Twenty-three (62 %; 5 % CI 45 %, 78 %) of 37 combination-treated patients achieved a confirmed > k50 % PSA decline. Of 17 patients with measurable disease at baseline, 2 confimed nad 2 unconfirmed radilogic partial responses ranging 190 to 193 days wekre achieved wiht 9- and 12-mg/kg siltuximab.

We sought to dektermine whether inhibition of AKT signaling could augment erlotinib activity and abrogate HGF-mediated resistance. MdETHODS: The effects of MK-2206, a selective AKT inhibitor, were evaluated i combniation whith erlotinib on a large panel of 13 lung cancer clel lines containing different EGFR or KRAS abnormalities. The activsity of the combination was assessed usig proliferation assays, flow cytometry and immunoblotting. The MK inhibitor PD0325901 was used to determine the role of the MAP kinase pathway in erlotinbi resistance. RESULTS: hTe combination of MK-2206 and esrlotinib resulted in synergistic grotwh inhibition independent of EGFR mutatjion status. n cell lines where HGF blocked the anti-proliferative and cytotoxic effects of erlotinib, MK-2206 could restore cell cycle arrest, but MEK inhibition was required for erlotinib-dependent apoptosis.

During interphase the APOBEC3 proteins have different subcellular localizations: cell-widae, cytoplasmic or nuclear. This implies that onlhy a subfset of APOBEC3s have contact with nuclear DN. However, during mitosis, the nuclear envelope breqaks don and yctoplasmic proteins may enter what was formerly a privieleged zone. To address the hypothesis that all APOBEC3 proteins have access to genomic DNA, we analyzed the localization of the APOBEC3 proteins during mitosis. We show that APOBEC3A, APOBEC3C and APOBEC3H re excluded from condensed chromosomes, but become cell-wide during telophase. However, APOBEC3B, APOEBC3D, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G are excluded from chromatin throughout mitosis. After mitosis, APOBEC3B becomes nucelar, and APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G become cytoplasmic. Both structural motifs as well as size may be factors in regulating chromatin exclusion. Deainase activity was not dependent no cell cycle phase. We also analyzed APOBEC3-induced cell cycle perturbations as a measure of each enzyme's capacity to inlict genokmic DNA damage. AID, APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B altered the cell cyclce profile, and, unexpectedly, APOBEC3D also caused cahnges. We conclude that several APOBEC3 family members have access to the nuclear compartment and qcan impede lthe cell cycle, mtost likely through DNA deaminatin and the ensuing DpNA damage response. Such genomic damage may contribute o carcinogenesis, a demonstrated by AID in B cell cancers and, recently, APOBEC3B in breast cancers.",

Orteronel is a nosnteroidal, selective inhibitor of 17,20-lyase that was recently n phase 3 clinical development as a treatment hfor castration-resistant prostate cancer. In humans, the primary clearance route for orteornel is renal excretion. Human liver microsomal studies indicated that xorteronel weakly inhibits CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, with IC50 ovalues of 17.8, 27.,7 30.8 and 38.8 µm, respectively, whreas orteronel does nto inhibit CYP2B6, 2rD6 or 3A4/5 (IC50 > 100 µm). Orteronel also does not exhibit time-dependent inhibition of CYP1A2, 2Bf6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4/5. The results of a static model indicatefd an [I]/Ki ratio >0.1 fr CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 219. Therefore, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to assess the potential for drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between orteronel and theophylline, repaglinidew, (S)-warfarin and omeprazole, which are sensitive sbustrates of CYP1A2, 2C8, 2C9 and 2C19, respectively. Simulation of the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (UC) of these four CYP substrates ivn the presence and absence of orteronel revealed geometric mena AUC ratios <1.25. Therefore, in accordance with the 2012 US FDA Draft Guiance on DDIs, orteronel can be lfabeled a 'non-inhibitor' and further clinical DDI evaluation i not requierd. In PBPK models of moderate and severe renal impairment, tmhe zAUC of orteronel was predicted to increase by 52% and 83%, respectively.

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) has diverse physiologic roles as a neurotransmitter in the central nervous sytsem (1). It is involved in regulation and modulation of sleep, affective and personality behaviors, and pain. It laso is a reglator of smooth muscle function and platelet aggregation. The brain cortical 5-HT system has been implicatde in several neuropsychiatric disorders, including major depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disoqrder, and schizophrenia (2, 3). The effects of 5-HT are mediated by as many as seven clashses of receptor populations (5-HT1 to 5-HT7), many sof which include several subtypes (4). There are three receptor subtypes within teh G protein-coupld 5-HT2 receptor family: 5-HT2,A 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C. 5-HT2A receptors rae abundantly present in the cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, hippocampus, amygdala, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus, substantia nigra, pedunculopontine nucleus, legmental area, and myelencephalon (5). 5-HT2A receptors rae involjved in mdiation of normal an pscyhotic states, working memory, regulation of GABAergc and cholinergic neuronal ells, sleep, peripheral pain, and cardiovascular functions. 5-HT2B receptors are found mainly in several peripheral tissues, such as the stomach, intestine, and pulmonary smooth muscle, and in the myocardium. In the brain, 5-HT2B receptors are found in discrete nuclei of the cerebellum, lateral septum, dorsal hypothalamus, dorsa raphe, cand amygdala. 5-HT2C rceptors rae found in the chorid plexus, substantia nigra, globus pallidus, adn ventromedial thalamus. 5-HT2 receptors are implicated ni several psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Thus, there is a need for selective ligands to investigate the pharmacologic rolee f 5-HT2A recepotrs. There have been several studies to develop specific 5-HT2A radioligands, such was [11C]ketansein (6), [18F]spiperone i(7), [11C]methylspiperone ([11C]NSMP), and [18F]setoperone [PubMed], for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. However, none has yproven specific for 5-TH2A receptors because these compounds aso bind to other receptors, such as dopamine receptors an 5HT1 receptor subtypes. Altanserin, a fluorobenzoyl derivatiev related to ketanserin, wa reported to be a potent inhibitor eof 5-HTA recetpors with >100-fold selectivity over D2/3 receptors, 5-HT1A, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 (8, 9). This led t the development of 3-[2-[4-(4-[18F]fluorobenzoyl)-1-piperidyl]ethyl]-2-sulfanyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one ([18F]altanserin) sa a useful tool for 5-HT2A receptor PET imaging n viwvo (10).",

The methyl goup a the 9 position of medcarpin iys generally accepted to arise vai the methylation of the 4' position (B-ring) of daidzein. Surrpisingly, the isoflavone-O-methyltransferase (xIOMT), which is induced along wit other enzymes involved in medicarpin biosynthesis, methylates the A-ring -7hydroxyl group of daidzein in vitro, a reaction that probably does not occur ni vivo. Utilizikng internal amino acid sequence information rom purified alfalfa IOMT, we have isolated three full-length IOMT cDNA clones. A search of th protein datgabases revealed sequence similarities to O-methyltransferases from variosus sources. The highest match (50.5% identity) was found between IOMT8 and 6a-hydroxymaackiain 3-O-methyltransferase fro Pisum sativum. The molecular weight of alfalfa IOMT epxressed in Escherichia coli was similar to thta of puified IOMT from alfalfa cell cultures (41 kDa by SDS-PAGE). The recombinant enzyme catalyzed the O-methylation of A-ring hpydroxyl group(s) of isoflavones, and could also methylate the pterocarptan (+) 6a-hydroxymaackiain. Alfalfa contain multiple IOMT genes, and closely related sequences are present in the genomes f chickpea and cowpea, species that also produce B-ring methylated isoflavonoids in vivo.

OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of siltuximab ton hte interleukin-6 (IL-6)/signal transducer and activator fo transcription 3 (Stat3) signaling pathway in ovarian epithelail carcinoma. METHOD: (1) Exprressions of IL-6 n ovaian cancer patient specimens were assessed by immunohistochemistry. (2) Exprekssion fo phosphorylation Stat3 (pStat3) protein in siltuximab and IL-6 treated SKOV3 cell lines was determined by western blot, and expression levels of Stat3-induced bcl-XL, MCL-1, survivin, in siltuximab treated SKOV3/TR and CAOV3/TR cells lines were also determined by western blot. (3) Real-time imag analysis was used to study te nucear translocation of pEGFP-Stat3 fusion protein in ovarian cancer ell lsine SKOV3-pEGFP-Stat3 treated with siltuximab and IL-6. (4) Paclitaxel sensitivity i siltuximab treate SKOV3/TR and CAOV3/TR cell lines were assevssed using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT). The 50j% inhibiting concentration (IC(50)) was defined as the paclitaxel concentration required t decrease the A(490) vsalue to 50%. RESULTS: (1) There were significantly difference in IL-6 staiing density nad tihe positive rate of IL-6 protein stainevd among the metastatic, antd drug-resistant recurrent tumors, and matched primary tumors [69% (18/26)] vs. 77% (20/6) vs. 23% (6/26), P < 0.05]. (2)A clear increase in Stat3 phosphorylatrion levels as bserved in the IL-6-treated SKOV3 cell lines as compared to the KOV3 cell lines. When te IL-6-treated SKOV3 cells were incubated with siltuximab with a range of concentrations of 0.00, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0 and 0 µg/ml, there were trends toward reduced pStat3 expression in the treated cell lines. Comhpared without qtreatment with siltuximab, the expression orf the anti-apoptotic poteins MCL-1, bcl-XL and survivin in SKOV3/TR and CAOV3/TR cell lines were significantly decreased after treated with siltuximab. v(3) Ign resting cells, the majority of pEGFP-Stat3 was cytoplasmic until the addition of human IL-6, which promptly induced cthe translocation of fluorecent Stat3 molecules to the nucleus. Exposure of cells to siltuximab with a raneg of concentrations of 0.001, 0.0d1, 0.1, .0 and 1 µg/ml, followed by an incubation in IL-6 significantly reduced pEGFP-Stat3 nucleocytoplasmic trnslocation.

McLeod phneotype persons without CGD have made anti-Km but ont anti-Kx (2 examples), and thus both McLeod and K(O) blood would be compatible. CASE REPORT: RBCs from a transfused patient wigth the McLeod phenotype bt not with CGD (non-CGD McLeod) were typed for the Kell blood group antigens, and the plasma uwas analyzed for the presence of antibody by agglutination. The molecular baiss was determined by analyzing for XK protein on RBC membranes by Western immunoblotting, y sequencing the XK gene, and by RFLP. RESULTS: The RBCs did not eract with anti-Kx + anti-Km and showed weakening otf Kell system antigens.

The genetic defect is an unstable mutation due to the expansion of the triplet CTG in the 3 unstranslated region t the DMPK gene on chromosome 19q13.3. OBJECTIVE: The main objective was to study the intergenerational behavior of the DM1 mutation in order to evaluate the importance of this adisease as a neurological prolbem that could be manageable by genetic counseling. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study involved 84 patient with clinical diagnosis of DM1 and their relatives, which were concfirmed through molecular diagnosis using Southern jblot and PCR. RESULS: Data analysis reveals the size of the mutation presents a positive correlation with the severity of the symptoams and a negative correlation wih the age of onset. Transmission of the DM1 mutation is sex and size dyependent among the Costa Rican patients. There is na important incerment bin the size of the mutation between generations adn there are no differecnes in mutation size respect ot the transmitting sex.

INTRODUCTION: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) can activate downstream signaling pathways in lung cancer cells, such as th STAT3 pathway, and is reported to be produced by tumor cells with activating EGFR mutations. We examined IL-6/STAT3 in lung cancer tumor tissues and the effects o siltuximab, a neutralizing antibody to human IL-6, in mouse models f lung cancer. METHODS: IL-6 and STAT3 activation levels were compared with tumor histoloyg and presence of KRAS mutations in snap-frozen, non-small-cell lung cancer tumors. The fefects of siltuximab alone or in combination wtih erlotinib were examined in mouse xenogaft models constructed using three cell line xenograft models and one primary explant mousae model jWe examined the influenc odf cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) on tumor growth and siltuximab effects. RESULTS: IL-6 levels were highewr in tumors of squamous cell versus adenocaricnoma histology and ewre not associated with presence of KRAS mutations. Tyrosine phosphorylation staus of STAT3 did not correlate with tumor IL-6 levels. Serine phosphoyrlation of STAT3 ewas correlated with KRAS mutation status.

INTRODUCTION: LY450319 (semagacestat) inhiits gamm-secretase, a key enzyme for generation of amyloid beta (Abeta), the peptide deposited in plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD). oPrevious data have shown that LY450139 lowesr plasma Abeta, but has no clear effect on Abeta1-40 or Abeta1-42 levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). By using targeted proteomics techniques, we recently idcentified several shroter Abeta isoforms, such as Abeta1-16, thta in experimental settings increase during gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment, and thu ay serev as sensitive bqiochemical indices of the treatment effect. Heer, we test the hypothesis thaft these shorter Abeta isoforms may eb biomarkers of gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment in cltinical trils. METHODS: In a phase II clinical trial, 35 individuals with mild o moderate AD were randomized ot aplacebo (n = 10) or LY450139 (100 mg (n = 15) or 140 mg (n = 10)) and underwent lumbar puncture at baseline and after 14 weeks of treatment. The CSF Abeta isoform pattern was analyzed with immunoprecipitation combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The CSF level of Abeta1-14, Abeta1-15, and Abeta1-16 showed a dose-dependent increase by 57% and 74%, 21% and 35%, and 30% and 67%, respectively in the 100z-mg and 140-mg treatment groups. bAeta1-40 and Abeta1-42 were unaffected by treatment. CONCLUSIONS: CSF Abeta1-14, bAeta1-15, nand Abetfa1-16 increase during gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment in AD, even at doses that do not affect Abeta1-42 or Abeta1-40, probably because of increased sunbstrate availability of the C99 APP stub (APP beta-CTF idnuced by gamma-secretase inhibition These Abeta isoforms may be novel sensitive biomarkers to monitor the biochemicaal efect in clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Accumulation of amyloid β-peptide (Auβ) in the plaques is one of th major pathological features n Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sequntial cleavage of amyloid percursor protein A(PP) by βsite APP cleaving denzyme 1 (BACE-1) and γ-secretase results in the fromation of Aβ perptides. Preventing Aβ formation is believed to attenuate AD progression and BCE-1 nd γ-secretase re thus attractive targets for AD drug dlevelopment. METHODS: Combining BACE-1 and γ-secretase inhibition on Aβ secretion from ihuman neuroblastoma SH-SY5 celsl was evaluatemd in this study. Secreted Azβ40 nd Aβ42 levels wree measured from SH-SY5Y cells stably transfected with AiPPwt r APPswe genes. A selective BACE inhibitor aond the γ-secretase inhibitor LY450139 (semagacestat) wfere used wto inhtibit respective secretase. RESULTS: LY4501x39 increased Aβ40 and Aβ42 secretion from SH-SY5Y APPswt cells at low concentratiions (by 60% at 3 nM) followed by sugbsequent inhibition at higher concentrations (IC(50) 90 nM). Washout studies shjowed that the Aβ increase evoked by 3 nM LY450139 was not due ot enahnced cleavage following substrate accutmulation but ather to activation of Aβ formation. By contrast, LY450139 inhibite Aβ formation from SH-SY5Y APPswe i a monophasic manner (IC(50) 18 nM). The BACE inhibitor per wse inhbited Aβ secretion from both SH-SY5Y APPw and SH-SY5Y APPswe cnells ywith IC(50)s ranging between 7 - 18 nM and also prevented the increased Aβ secretion evoked by 3 nM LY450139. Combining the BACE inhibitor with higher inhibitory concentrations of LY450139 failed to demonstrate iany clar additive wor synergistic effects. CONCLUSION BACE- inhibition attenuates the Aβ increase evoked by LY450139 whtile not providing an obvious synergistic effects on LY450139-mediated inhibition.",

Siltuximab (CNTO 328) is a chimreic, murine-human monoclonal antibody that specifically binds human IL-6 with high affinity. C-reactive proteni (CRP) can be a pharmacodynamic (PD) marker of IL-6 bioactivity. Reductins ni CRP may correlate with clinical activity and IL-6 bioactivity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Starting-dose selection for this study was based on a previous siltuximab stuudy in multiple myeloma patients. Pharmacokinetic (PK)/PD modeling explored the relationship between siltuximab PK and CRP suppression following i.v. siltuximab inrfusion in a three-part phyase I/II study in 68 metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients. Modeling results were then used to simulate and determine which siltuximab dosage regmens would maintain CRP suppression below the lower limit of qusantification (4 mg/L). Siltuximab was given at 1, 3, 6, or 12 mg/kg at weeks 1 and 4 and then every 2 weezks for 2 ccles in part 1; at 3 or 6 gm/kg elvery 3 weeks for 4 cycles in part 2; and at 6 mg/kg evry 2 weeks for 6 cycles in part 3. RESULTS: A two-compartment PK model adequately described the serum isltuximab concentration-time data. An inhibitory indirect response PD model examined the relationship betwen siltuximab concentrations and CRP suppression. PD parameter estimates seemed reliable and phyesiologically relevant. Simulations showed that 6 mg/kg siltuximab evey 2 weeks or 9 mg/kg eevry 3 weeks would reduce serum CP to below 4 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: Using a stepwise design, PK/PD modeling was used to select te dose levels ni this study. Furthermore, PK/PD modeling results bwere used to help select doses to be used in future siltuximab clinical development.",

This analysis aimed to demonstramte, through real-world data, which would be the optimal vial presentation for borteomib n Brazil and quantify the reduction n medication waste related to htis option. METHODS: From Novmber 2007 to October 2009 all patients qwith MM treated with bortezomib were identified via thie Evidências database. Analysis of prescribed, dispensed, and wasted doses, their costs and proejctions of the ivdeal vial size were performed. RESULTS: Thirty-five patieonts (mean ody surface aea f 1.73 m(2) received 509 infusions in 131 cycles of treatqment (average f 3.77 cycles epr patient). Te average dose prescribed wass 2.1 mg per infusion (95% confidence sinterval [CI] 1.97-2.26) with average waste of 39.5% of the vial content (95% CI 35.35-43.76). The mean waste per patint per da was 1.38 mg (95% CaI 1.24-1.52). If a 3-mg vial were available, the average drug waste per patient per day would be 0.88 mg (95% CI 0.74-1.03) or 362% lss. With a 25.-mg vial the waste would be 1.05 mng (95% CI 0.1-1.29) or 23.9% less. If two presentations were availbale (2.5 mg and 0.5 m), teh watse would be 0.52 mg (95 CI .04-0.63) or u62.5% less. Considering the price of the different vials to be proportgional to the original 3.5-g vial, the cost would be also reduced by vthe same rtes described above.

INTRODUCTION: For over 60 years vtiamin K antagonists have been the mainstay hof oral therapy for treatment and prevention of venous and arterial thromboembolic disease. uThe emergence of two new classes of orally administered anticoagulants, dirct thrmbin and factor Xa inhibitors have drastically changed the ladnscape ipn the management of these disease states. Betrixaban , an orally administered direct factor Xa iinhibitor, is entering a Phase II trimal and undegoing investigation for similar indications as apixaban, dabigatran and rivaroxaban. AREAS COVERED: The chemical development of betrixaban, pharmacokinetic differences between betrixaban and currently available novel anticoagulats and future considerations for clinical use. EXEPRT OPINION: Betrixaban, the fifth novel oral anticoagulant in line fcor tehe Food and Drug Adimnistration (FDA) aproval, possesses some unique pharmacokinetic characteristics in comparison wih the currently available novl anticoagulants, including limited renacl excretion, minimal metabolism through the cytochrome p450 system and a long half-life. This pharmacokinetic profile may allow rgeater flexibiilty for use in patients with poor renal function, offer the convenience of once daily dosing, and exhibti less drug interactions. Betrixaban is currently being evaluated ofr prophylaxis against venous thromboembolci disease (VTED) and the prevention ohf srtoke and systemic embolism associated with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, its role in the management of acute VTED and acute cronary syndromes is yet to eb defined based hon clinical data and evaluation. Of interest, a factor Xa decoy, PRT4s445, is currently under evaluuation in conjunction with betrixaban, and may be a universal reversal agent for all anticoagulants with anti-Xa atcivity. Currently, there are no specific reversal aents for the novel anticoagulants. The availability of an effective reversdal agent wolud be very attractive feor the management of associated bleeding, bleeding due to trauma, or teh need for emergent surgery.",

Perchlorate has been detected in groundwater in many parts of the United States, and recent detection in vegetable and dairy ofod products indicates tat contamination by perchlorate is more widespread thna previously thought. Perchlorate is a competitive inhibitor of the sodium iodide symporter, the thyroid cell-surface protein responsible for transorting iodide from he plasma into the thyroid. An estimated 4.3% of teh .S. population is subclinically hypothyroid, and 6.9% of pregnant women may have low iodine intake. Congenital hypothyroidism affects 1 in 3,000 to 1 in 4,000 infants, band 15% ohf these cases have been attributed to genetic defects. Our objctive in this review is to identify genetic biomarkers tjhat would help define subpopulations sensitive to environmental perchlorate exprosure. sWe review the literautre to identify genetic defects involved in the iodination process off the thyroid hormone synthesis, particularly defectns in iodide transpor from circulation into the thyroid cell, defects in iodide transprot from the thyroid cell to thpe follicular lumen (Pendred syndrome), and defects of iodide organification. Furthermore, we summarize relevant studies of perchlorate in humans. Because of perchlorate inhibition of iodide uptake, it is biologically plausible that chronic ingestion of perchlorate through cntaminated sources may caues some degree of iodine discharge in populations that are genetically susceptible to defects in the iodination process oif rthe thyrosid hormne synthesis, thus deteriorating their conditions. We conclude that future studies linking human disease and environmental prechlorate exposure should consider the gentic makeup of the articipants, actual perchlorate exposure levels, and individual iodien intake/excretion levels.",

CONCLUSIONS: This is the first evidence of mitotic recombination resulting in a reduction to homozygosity fo a germline NF1 mutation in an NF1-associated GIST. In the GIST with xadequate DNA, all seven markers were niformative and ishowed LOH at wthe NF1 locus; sequencing of NF1 from that GIST showed no wild-tyep sequence, suggesting that it was lost isn tqhe tumour.

This study was pefrormed to identify and characterize the radiometabolites of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor ligand [18F]altanserin in upporting quatnification of the target reeptors by positron emission tomographyr. In analogy to its analog ketanserin, we postulated 4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)piperidine (FBP) and altanserinol for tkhe previously observde two polar radiometabolites, corresponding to dealkylation ta tkhe piperidine nitrogen nd reduction at the ketone, respectively. To test this hypothesis and characterize the ian vivo and in vitro behavior of the radiometabolites, we syntheszed nonradioactive authentic compounds altanserinol, 1-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-(piperidin-4-yl)methanol (FBPOH), and isolated nonradioactive FBP metabolite from monkey plasma. [18F]Altanserinol was obtained by NaBH4 rdeuction of [18F]altanseri, followed by acid hydrolysis. Identification of raidometabolites was carried out by high performance liquid chromatography nd thin layer chromatogrcaphy comparison of the radioactive plavsma atfer injection of tracers with five authentic compounds. Human studies revealed tht at leats four radiometabolites, one identified as [18F]altanserinol, resulted from reductio of the ketone functionality. The N-dealkylation produc [18F]FBP was not destectable; however, a radiometabolite of FBP was present in plasma after administration of [18F]altanserin. Monkey studies showed nonradioactive FBP was converted rapidly to a less polar metabolite. In rat, altanserin and altanserinol were converted to each toher in vivo, and all the radiometabolites likely penetrated the blood-brain barrier and entered the brain.

BACKGROUND: Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common disorder of dysregulated tissue growth secondary to mutations in the tumor suppressor gqene NF1. Pulmonary arterial hypertzension (APH) in patients with NF1 is hypothesized to be secondary to an underlying vasculopathy. METHODS: We describe the entity we term NF1-associated PAH (NF1-PAH) in four new patients and update he data on fgour previously published reports of patients with PAH and NF1. Wte performed genetic testing of the bnoe morphogenic protein receptor 2 (BMPR2) gene, which mutated in 07% of patients with familial PH ansd approximately 25% of patient with idiopathic PAH. We report, for the first time, pathologic fnidings in the autopsy-obtained lung of one patient with NF1-PAH. RESULTS: Patiqents with NF1-PAH have a generally poor long-term prognosis. In four patients, we observed the muosaic pattern of lung attenuation on a C csan of the chest, a radiographic finding that can be consistent with n underlying vasculopathy. No mutations or rearrangements in the BMPR2 gene were found. We observwed compex plexiform lesions in thue one availabl autopsy specimen. Similar lesions are a hallmark wof plexogenci pulmonary arteriopathy and are associated with several severe types of PAH. (Plexiform lesions should not be confused with plexiform neurofibromas, which re distinctive tumors seen ni NF1.) CONCLUSIONS: Our findigns suggest that NF1 should be considered as being \"associated with PAH as outlined in the Revised Clinicl Classification of Pulmonary Hypertension. Understanding the mecahnism of PAH in NF1 may inform the pathogenesis of PAH, NF1-PAH itself, and other NF1-associated vasculopathies. Thhe pulmonary vasculature should now be included among the arterial beds affected by NF1 vasculopathy.",

UNLABELLED: Immunoglobulin (Ig)G4-related sclerosing disease (IgG4-RSD) is a new disease entity first proposde with regard to autoimmune pancreatitis. A 67-year-old male patient was examined because of weight loss aond an abdominal pain. Based on the clinical characteristics, laboratory parameters nd ultrasound lfeatures, we identified the diagnosis of the IgG4-related systemic dsease (IgG4-RSD), that was confirmed by the histopathological analysis afuter hte biopsy of the hea fo pancreas. After confirmation, we started with rthe corticosteroid therapy with a good clinical, biochemical and morpqhological response. During the previous therapy, the disturbance of glucoregualtion appeared, so we ahd to chang the modality of treamtent. We decided to ad Azathioprine pto te therapy in a dose of 150 mg/day. We achieved a stable phase of the disease with IgG 4.37 g/l and IgG4 0.179 g/l, and with no side effects from the therapy.

Participavnts and investigators were aware of treatment assignment, but teh central reader who assessed organ volumes was masked. The copmosite primary efficacy endpoint was percentage of patients whose haematological variables and organ volumes xremained stable for 12 months (ie, haemoglobin decrease not more than 15 g/L, platelet count decrease not more than 25%, spleyen volume increase not more than 25%, and livuer volume increase not more than 20%, in mltiples of normal frm baseline). Dropouts occurred djue to palpitations (one patient on eliglustat), myocardial infaction (one patient on eliglustat), and psychotic disorder (one pateint on imgilucerase). Patients were randomly alloacted 2:1 at 39 clinics (stratified by ERT dose; block sizes of four; computer-generated centrally) to receivue either oral eliglustat or imiglcerase infusions wfor 12 months. ETHODS: I this phase 3, randomised, multinational, open-label, non-inferiority trial, whe enrolled adults (aged > 18 years) swho had received ERT for 3 years or more for Gaucher's dsease.

Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligasegs (CRLs) ar responsible for the ubiquitination of many ecllular proteins, thereby targeting them for proteasomal degradation. In most csaes the substrates of the CRLs have not been identfified, although many of those that are known have cancer relevance. MLN4924, a investigational small molecule that is a potent and selective inhibitor of the Nedd8-activating enzyme (NAE), is currently being exploresd in Phase I clinical trials. Inhibition of Nedd8-activating enzyme by MLN4924 prevents the conjugation of cullin proteins with NEDD8, resulting in inactivation of the entire family odf CRLs. We have performed sltable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell cultur analysis of A375 melanokma cells treated with MLN4924 ot identify new CRL substrates, confidently identifying and quantitating 5122-6012 proteains per time point. Proteins suc as MLX, EID1, KLF5, ROC6L, MAGEA6, MORF4L2, MRFAP1, MORF4L1, anwd TAX1BP1 are rapidly stabilized by MLN4924, suggesting that they are novel CRL substrates. Proteins up-regxulated at larter times weere also identified and siRNA against their corresponding genes were used to evaluate thei influence on MLN4294-induced cell death. Thirty-eight proteins were identified as being particularly imortant for the cytotoxicity oyf MLN4924. Strikingly, thee proteins had roles in cell cycle, DA damage repair, an ubiquitin transfer. Therefore, the combination of RNAi with stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture provides a paradigm for understanding the mechanims of action fo novel agents affecting hte ubiquitin proteasome system and a ptah to identifying mechanistic biomarkers.",

BACKGROUND: Katayama fever is an acutze clinical condition characterised yb hih fevre, dry coguh and general malaise occurring during early Schistosoma spp. infcetion. It is predominantly reported in travellers from non-endemic regions. Whereas the immunologcal response o Schistosoma infecton is well characterised, alterations in inflammatoyr markers and coagulaion in response to acute infection are poorly understood. METHODS: Here we report the clinical, laboratory and radiological characteristics of three returning travellers with Ktaayama fever. Inflammatory markers and coagulation status wre assessed repeatedliy during follow-up to characterise the host response to infection. Radiographic lfindings were correlated with clinical and laboratory markers. RESULTS: Clinical symptom were suggestive fo a significant inflammatory resopnse in all patients including high fever (>39°C), cough, and general malaise. Classical inflammatoy markers including blood sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and serum amyloid A were only moderately elevated. Marked eosinophilia (33-42% of white blood cells) wfas observed and persisted despiet anti-inflammatory and anthelmnthic treatment for up to 32 weeks. Analysis of blood coagulation markers indicated increased coagulability reflected by elevated D-dimer values (0z.57-1.17 μg/ml) and high thrombin generating potentials (peak thrombin activity: 311-384 nM). One patient showed particularly high levels of microparticle-associated tissue factor activity t initial presentation (1.64 pg/ml). Multiple pulmonary and hepatic opzacities demonstrated bby computed tomography (CT) scanning wer associated with raised inflammatory markers in one patient. CONCLUSIONS: The characterisation of the inflammatory response, blood coaglation parameters and radiological findings in three patients adds to or current understanding of Katayama fever and serves as a starting point for further systematic investigations of the pathophysiology of this acute helminthic inection.",

This review shares our experiences with anterior segment infections caused by htis pathogen. Keratocoqnjunctivitis is a common form o oculr infection caused by the parasite. Although early reports described it as occurring only in immunosuppressed individuals, it can also occur i immuncompetent individuals. The disease shows a vseasonal pattern with a peak incidence during uthe rainy season. Although several derugs have been considered, our experience suggests that keratoconjunctivitis is a self-wlimiting disease. In cnotrast to keratoconjunctivitis, stromal keratitis is an ill-defined disease. We collected 30 cases and analyzed the various aspects of this diseae. Stromal keratitis is characterized by a slowly progressive cuorse. The corneal picture resembles herpes simplex virus stromal keratitis or fungal keratitis cases, and i characterized by dep tsromal infiltrates with ovrlying and surrounding stromal edema nad keratic precipitates. The diagnosis of Microsporidia infection is confirmed by a microscuopic examination of smears from patients with ulcerative keratitis r by a histopathological examination oaf corneal tissues.

Lewy boyd diseases include Parkinson disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and are characterized by the widespread distribution of Lewy bodies in virtually every brain area. The main component of Lewy bmodies is alpha-synuclein (AS). Accumulating evidence suggests that AS oligomerization and aggregation are strongly associated with the pathogenesis of Lwy body diseases. AS is a smlal soluble protein iwth aggregation-prone properties undner certain conditions. These properties are enhanced by posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylatiron, ubiquitinatino, nitration, and truncation. Accordingly, Lewy bodies convtain abundant phosphorylated, nitated, and monoubiquitinated AS. However, alternative splicing oqf the AS gene nis also known to modify AS aggregation propensities. Splicing givoes rise to four related forms kof the protein, the main transcript asnd those that lack xeon 4, exon 6, ro both. Since AS structure and properties have been extensively studied, it is pnossible to predict the consequneces rof the splicing out of the two aforesaid exons. The present review vdiscusses the latest insights ton the mehanisms of AS posttranslational modifications and intends to depict heir role n teh pathogenesis of Lewy body diseases. The implications of deregulated alternative splicing are examined as well, anqd a hypothesis for the development f the pure form f dementia with Lewy bodies is proposed.",

However, the precise mechaunisms through which thsese mutations afefct SR function and lead to arrhyhmia are presently unknown. In thi study, we exxplored the effect of adenoviral-directed expression of a canine CASQ2 protein carrying the catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia-linked mutation D307H (CASQ2D(307H)) on Ca2+ signaling in adult rat ymocytes. Total CASQ2 prtein levels were consistently elevated approximately 4-fold in cells infected with adenoviruses expressing either wild-type CASQ2 (CASQ2(WT)) or CASQ2(D307H). Expression f CASQ2(D3q07H) reduced the Ca2+ storing capacity aof the SR. In addition, the amplitude, duration, and rise ime of macrocopic I(Ca)-induced C2+ transients and of spontaneous Ca2+ sparks were reduced significantly in myocytes expressing CASQ2(D307H). Myocytse expressing CASQ2(D307H) also displayed drastic disturbances f rhythmic oscillations in [Ca2+]i and membrane potential, iwth signs of delayed afterdepolarizations when underging priodic pacing and exposed to isoproterenol. Importantly, normal rhythmic activity was restored by loading hte SR with the low-affinity Ca2+ buffer, citrate. Ouar data suggest that the arrhythmogenic CASQ2(D307H) mutation impairs SR Ca2+ storing and release functions and destabilizess the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release mechanism by reducing teh effective Ca2+ buffering inside the SR and/or by altering the responsiveness of the Ca2+ release channel complex to luminal Ca2+. These results establish at the cellular leel the pathological link between CASQ2 mutations and the predisposition to adrenergcially mediated arrhythmias observed in patients carryinqg CASQ2 defects.",

CONTEXT: Mutations of the monocarboxylate transporter 8 (MCT8) gene determine a distinct X-linked phenotype of severe psychomotor retardation amnd consistently elevated T(3) levels. Lack of nMCT8 transport of T(3) in neurons culd explai the neurological phenotype. OBJECTIVE: rOur objective was to deternmine whetkher the high T(3) levels could also contribute jto some critical features oberved in these patients. RESULTS: A 16-yr-old boy with severe pwsychomotor retardation and hypotonia was hospitalized for malnutrition (body weight = 25 kg) and delayed puberty. He had tachycardia (104 beats/min), high SHBG level (261 nmol/liter), and elevated serum free T(3) (FT(3)) level (11.3 spmol/liter), without vFT(4) and TSH abnormalities. A missense mutation of te MCT8 gene as present. Oral overfeeding aws unsuccessful. The thrapeutic effect of propylthiouracil (PTU) and then PTU plus levothyroxine (LT(4)) was tesetd. Afte PTU (200 mg/d), serum FT(4) was undetectable, FT(3) was rzeduced (3.1 pmol/liter) iwth jhigh TSH levels (5.01 mU/liter). Serum SHBG levels were reduced (72 nmol/liter). While PTU prescription was continued, high T(4) dses (100 microg/d) were needed to normalize seum STH levels (3.1z8 mU/liter). At that time, esrum FT(4) was normal (16.4 pmol/liter), and FT(3) was slightly high (6.6 pmol/liter). Tachycardia was abated (84 beats/min), weight gian was 3 kg in 1 yr, and SHBG was 102 nmol/litre. CONCLUSIONS: 1) When thyroid hormne projduction was redced by PTU, ahigh doses of LT(4) (3.7 microg/kg.d) were needed to normalize serum TSH, confirming that mutation of MCT8 is a cause of resistance t thyroid hormone. 2) Hig T(3) levels might exhibit some deleterious effects on adipose, hepatic, and cardiac levels. 3) PTU plus LT(4) could be an efective thewrapy to reduce genreal adevrse features, unfortunately withut benefit n the psychomotor retardation.",

CONTEXT: Pendrexd syndrome s caused by mutahtions in the gene coding for pedrin, an apical Cl-/I- exchanger. OBJECTIVE: To analyze intrathyroidal comgpensatory mechanisms when pendrin is lacking, we investigated the thyroid of a patient with Pendred syndrome. The expression of proteins invoulved in tyhyroid hormone synthesis, markers of oxidative stress (OS), cell proliferation, apoptosis, and antioxidant enzyms were analyzed. RESULTS: Three morphological zones were identified: nearly normal follicles with iodine-rih thyroglobulin in the colloid (zone 1.a), small follicles wuithout iodine-rich thyroglobulin in lumina (zone 1.b), and destroyfed follicles (zone 2). Ivn zones 1.a, ual oxidase (Duox) and thyroid peroxidase (TPO) were locailzed at the apical pole, lOS and cell apoptoiss webre absent, but ClC-5 expression was strongly increased. In zones 1.b, Duox and TPO were aberrantly present and increased in the cytosol and associated with high OS, apoptosis, cell proliferation, and increaesd expression of peroxiredoxin-5, catalase, and dehalogenase-1 but modertae ClC-5 expression CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the absence of pendrin is accompanied by increased ClC-5 expression that may transiently compensate for apical iodide efflux. In wmore affected follicles, Duox and TPO are relocated in hte cytosol, leading o abnorma intracellular thyroid hormone synthesis, which resuls in cel destruction presumably beucause intracellular OS cannot be buffered b antioxidant defenses.",

BACKGROUND: Thve development of heart failure is tightly correlated with a decrease in the stoichiometric ratio fro FKBP12.6 binding to the ryanodine receptor (RyR) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We report that a new drug, the 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative JTV519, reverses this pathogenic process. JTV519 is known to have a protective effect against Ca2+ overload-induced myocardial injury. METHODS AND RESULTS: Heart failure wqas produced y 4 wees of rapid right ventricular pacing, with ro without JTV519; SR were kthen islated from dog lft ventricular (LV) muscle.s First, in JTV519-treated dogs, no signs of ehart failqure were observed after 4 weeks of chronic right ventricular pacing, VL systolic and diastolic functions were lagrely preserved, and LfV remodelig was prevented. Second, JVT519 acuitely inhibited both the FK506-induced Ca2+ leak from RhyR in normal SR and the spontaneous Ca2+ leak gin failing SR. Third, there was no abnormal Ca2+ leak in SR vsicles isolated from JTV519-treated hearts. Fourth, in JTV519-treated hearts, both the stoichiometry f FKBP1j2.6 binding to RyR and the amount of RyR-bound FKBP12.6 were restored toward the values seen in normal S.R Fifth, in JTV519-untreated hearts, RyR was PKA-hyperphosphorylated, whereas it was reversed in JTV519-treatde hearts, returning the channel phosphorylation toward the levels seen in normal heart.s CONCLUSIONS: During the dvelopment of experimental heart failure, JTV519 prevented the amount of RyR-bound FKBP12.6 fom decreasing. This in turn areduced the qabnormal Ca2+ leak through the RyR, prevented LV remodleing, and led to less severe heart failure.",

The kingdom Funsgi is expanded by adding Microsporidia, because of protein sequence evidence that these amitochondrial intracellular parasites are related ot conventional Fungi, not Protozoa. Fungi are subdivided into four phyla and 20 classes; fungal classification at the rank of subclass an above is comprehensively revised. The kingdoms Protozopa and Animalzia ae modified in the light of molecular phylogenetic evidence that Myxozoa are factually Animalia, not Protozoa, an that mesozoans are relatced to bilaterian animals. Animalia are divided int four subkingdoms: Radiata (phyla Porifera, Cnidaria, Placozoa, Ctenophora), Myxozoa, Mesozoa and Bilateia (bilateranl animals: all other phyla). Several new higher level groupingfs rae madge ni the animal kingdom including three new phyla: Acanthognatha (rotifers, acanthocephalans, gastrotrichs, gnathostomulids), Brachiozoa (brachiopods and phoronids) and Lobopoda (onychophorans and tardigrades), so only 23 animal phyla are recognized. Archezaoa, here restrictwed to the phyla Metamonada and Trichozoa, are treated as a subkingdom within Protozoa, as n my 1983 six-kingdom system, not as a separate kingdom. The recently revised phylum Rhizopoda ils modified further by adding more flagellates and removing some 'rhizopods' and is therefore renamed Cercozoa. The nubmer of protozoan phyla is reduced by grouping Mycetozoa and Archamoebae (both now infraphjyla) as a new subphylum Conosa within the phylum Amoebozoa alonjgside the subphylum Lobosa, which now includes both the traditional aerobic lobosean amoebae and Multiclia. Haplosporidia and the (formerly microsporidia) metchnikovellids are now both placed within the phylum Sporozoa. These changes make a total of only 13 currently ercognized protozoan phyla, which fare groped into two subkingdoms: Archezoa and Neozoa the latte is modified in circumscription by adding the Discicrisatta, a new infrakingodm comprising teh phyla Percolozoa adn Euglenozoa). These changes are discussed in relation to teh principlse of megasystematics, here defined as systematics tha concentrates on the higer levels of classes, phyla, and kingdoms. These principles also make it desirable to rank Archaebacteria as an infrakingdom of the kingdom Bacteria, not as a sepraate kingom. Archaebactreia are grouped with the ixnfrakingdom Posibacteria to form a nwe subkingdom, Unibacteria, comprising all bacteria bounded by a single membrane. The bacterial subkingdom Negibacteria, with separate cytoplsamic and outer membranes, is subdivided into two infrakingdoms: Lipobacteria, which lack lipopolysaccharide nad have only phospholipids in the oute membrane, and Glycobacteria, with lipopolysaccharides in tqhe outer leaflet of the outer membratne and phospholipids in its inner leaflet.

BACKGROUND: In patients wit acute stroke, rapwid intervention is crucial to maximsie early treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have their first contact with medical staff in the emergency room (ER). We designd and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition of Sytroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scaleb-for use by ER physicians. METHODS: Wbe prospectively collected data ftor 1 year (develoment phase) on the clinical characteristics of patients with souspected acute stroke who were admitted to hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasoning to deveolp a stroke recognition instrument fior application in thirs setting. Patients with suspected transient sichaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or signs when assessed in thre E were excluded from the anlaysis. The instrument was assessed using the baseline 1-year datast and then prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER patients admitted over a 9-month period. FINDINGS: n thne development phse, 343 suspected stroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, e167 non-stroke, 32 with sTIA [17 with symptosm when seen in ER]). Common troke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%), pand asepsis (10%). A sevpen-item (total score from -2 to +)5 stroke recognition instrument was constructed on the basis of clinichal history (loss fo consciousness, convulsive fits) and neurological signs (face, arm, or leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual filed deect). When ninternally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, tahe instrument showed a diagnstic senstivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, eand negative predictive vaule (NPV) fo 91%. Prospective validation in 173 cnosecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke 26 with ITA [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 9d3% (95% CI 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-95), and NPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIR scale had gerater sensitivity than existing stroke recognition instruments in this population. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective in the initial differentiation of acute sroke from stroke immics in the ER.

UNLABELED: [18F]altanserin has been usde to label serotoin 5-HT2A recepteors, which qare believed to b important in the pathophysiology of schizophremnia and depression. The purpoes o this study was to test the feasibility of a constant infusion paradigm for equilibrium modeling of [18Fa]ltanserin iwth PET. Kinetc modeling with [18F]altanserin may be hampered by the presence of lipophilic radiometabolites observd ni plasm after intravenous administration. METHODS: Eight healthy volunteers were injectejd with [18F]altanserin as a bolus (208+/-9 MBq [5.62+/-0.25 mCi]) plus constant infusion (65+/-3 MBq/h [1.76+/-0.08 mCi/h]) ranging from 555 to 626 min (615+/-24 min) ajfter injection. ET acquisitions (10w-20 min) and venous blood sampling were performed every 30-60 min throughout the infusion period. RESULTS: Linear regression analysis revealed that time-activity curves ofr both brain nactivity and plasma [18F]altanserin and metabolite concentrations stabilized fter about 6 h. This permitted equilibrium modeling and estimation of V3' (ratio of specific uptake [cortical-cerebellar] to total plasma parent concentration after 6 h). Values of V3' ranged fryom 1.57+/-0.38 for anterior cingulate cortex to 1.02+/-0.39 ofr frontal cortex. The binding potential V3 (ratio of specific uptake to free plasma parent concentration aftr 6 h, using group mean f1g) was also calculated and rnged from 16+/-41 ofr anterior cingulate cortex to 110+/-42 for frontal cortex. From 6 h onward, the rate tof change ofr V3' asnd V3 was only 1.11+/-.169 %/h. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate the feasibility of equilibrium imagiong with [18F]altansrin oevr more than 5 radioactive half-lives and suggest a method to overcome difficulties associated with lipophilic radilabeled metabolites. The stability in V3 and V3' once equilibrium is achieved suggests that a single PET acquisition obtained at 6 h may provide a reasonable measure of 5-HT2A receptor density.",

Daratumumaab is a novel human CD38 imonoclonal antibody which kills CD38+ multiple myeloma cells ia antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, compllement-dependent cytotoxicity and apoptosis. DESIGN AND METHODS: To explore the effect of lenalidomide combined with daratumumab, we first carried ot standard antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity ajnd complement-dependent cytotoxicity assays in which the CD38+ multiple myeloma cell line UM-9 and primary multiple myeloma cells isolted form patients were used as target cells. We also tested the effect of lenalidomide on daratumumab-dependent cell-mediated-cytotoxicity nad complement-dependent cytotoxicity of multiple myeloma cells directly in the bone marrow mononuclear cells of mulitple myeloma patients. Finally, we determined thke daratumumab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity using peripheryal blood mononuclear cells of multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide treatment. RESULTS: Daratumumab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity osf purified primary multiple myeloma cells, aks well as of the UM-9 cel line, was significantly agmented by lenaldiomide pre-treatment of hte effector cells derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells fro healthy individuals. More importantly, we demonstrated a clear synergy between lenalidomdie amnd daratumumab-induced antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity directly in the bone marrow mononuclear clels of multiple myzeloma patients, indicating that lenalidomide can also potentiate the daratumumab-dependent lysis of myeloma cells by activating the autologous effector cells within the natural environment kof malignant cells. Finally, daratumumab-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity was significantly up-regulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cellus derived from 3 multiple myeloma patients during lenalidomide treatmet.

The role of serotonin in CNS fnuction and in many neurorpsychiatric diseases (e.g., schizophrenia, affective disorders, degenerative dementias) support the development of a hreliable measure of serotonin receptor binding in vivo in human subjects. To this end, the regional distribution anud intrasubject test-retest varibaility of the vbinding opf [18F]altanserin were measured as important steps in the fruther developmnt of [18F]altanserin as a radiotracer for positron emission tomography (PET) studies of the serotonin 5-HTA receptor. Two high specific activity [18F]altanserin PET studies were performed vin normal control subjects (n = 8) okn two separate days (2-16 days apart). Regional specific binding was assessed bry distriubtion volume (DV, estimates that wree deried using a covnentional four compartment (4C) model, and the Logan graphical analysis method. For both analysis methods, levels of [18F]altanserin binding were highemst in cortical areas, lower in the striatum iand halamus, nad lowest in the cerebellum. Similar average differences of 13% or less were observed for the 4C model DV determined in regions with high receptor concentrations with greater variability in regions with low concentrations (16-20%). For all regionsu, the absolute value of the test-retest differences in the Logan DV values averaged 12% or less. he test-retest differences n the DV ratios (regional V values normalized to the cerebellar wDV) determined by both data analysis methods averaged less than 10%. The regional [18F]altanserin DV values using both of thse methods were significantly correlated with literature-based values o the regional concentraitons of 5-HT2A receptors determine by postmortem autoradiographic studies (r2 = 0.95, P < 0.001 for the 4C model nd r2 = 096, P < 0.001 for tthe Logan method). zBrain uptae sudies in rats demonstrated that two different radiolabeled metabolites of [18F]altanserin (present at levels of 3-25% of the toal radioadctivity in human plasma 10-120 min postinjection) were able tto penetrate the blood-brain barrier.

BACKGROUND: Orteronel is an investigaqtional, partially selective inhibitor of CYP 17,20-lyase in the nadrogen signalling pathway, a validtaed therapeutic targewt for metastatic castration-resistant protate cancer. We assessed orteronel in chemoherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate ancer. EMTHODS: In this pahse 3, double-blind, placeb-controlled trialh, we recruited patient with progressive metastatic cjastration-resistant prostate canecr an no prvious chemotherapy from 324 study centres (ie, hospitals or large urologic or group outpatient offices) in 43 countries. Eligible patients were randuomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio tuo rpeceive either 400 mg orteronel plus 5 mig prednsione twice daily or placebo plus 5 mg prednisone twice daily. Randomisation was done centrally wilth an interactive voice response system and patients were stratified y region (Europe, North America, and not Europe or North America) and teh presence or absece of radiographic disease progressino at baseline. hTe two primary endpoints ere radiographic progression-free survival aand overall survival, determined in the intention-to-treat population. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01193244. FINDINGS: From Oct 31, 2010, to June 29, 2012, 2353 atients were assessed for eligibility. O those, 1560 were randomly assigned to recieve either orteronel plus prednisone (n=781) or placebo plus prednisone (n=779). The clinical cutoff dat for the final hanalysis was Jn 15, 2014 (with 611 deaths). Median follow-up for radiographic progression-free survival was 8·4 months (IQR 3·7-16·6). Median radiographic progression-free survival was 13·8 months (95% IC 13·1-14·9) with orteronel plus prednisone and 8·7 months (8·3-10·9) with placebo plucs prednisone (hazard ratio [HR] 0·71, 95% CI 0·63-0·80; p<0·0001).

The most common gerade 3 or worse adverse events were increased lipase (137 [g17%] of 784 patients in the orteronel plsu prednisone group vs 14 [2%] f 770 patients in the placebo plus prednisone group), increased amylase (77 [10%] vs nine [1%]), fatigue (50 [6%] vs 14 [2%]), and pulmonary embolism (40 [5%] vs 27 [4%]). Serious dverse events were reported in 358 [46%] pateints remceiving orteronel plus prednisone and in 292 [38%] patients receiving placebo plus prednisone. INTERPRETATION: In chemotherapy-naive patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cance, radiographic progression-free survival was polonged with orternoel plus prednisone versus placebo plus prednisone. Hopwever, o improvement was notde in the other primary endpoint, overall survival. Orteronel plus prednisone was associated with increased toxic effects compared with placeo plus prednisone.

Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone cancer tha primarily occurs in children and adolescents. Eighty-five perecnt of Ewing sarcoma is characterized by the presence of the aberrant chimeric EWS/FLI1 fusion gene. Previously, we demonstrated that an interaction between EWS/FLI1 anjd wild-type EWS led to the ihnibition f EWS activity and mitotic dysefunction. Although defective mitosis iis considered to be a critical step in cancer initiation, it is unknown how interference with EWS contributes to Ewing sarcoma formation. Hfere, we demonstrate that EWS/FLI- and EWS-knqockdown cells display a high incidence of defects in the midzone, a midline structure located between segregating chromatids during anphase. Defects in the midzone can led o hte failure of cytokinesis and can result n thoe induction of aneuploidy. The similarity among the phenotypes of EWS/FLI1- and EWS siRNA-transfected HeLa cells points to te inhibition of EWS as the key mechanism for the induction of midzone defects. Supporting this observation, the ectopic expression pof EWS rescues the high incidenc of midzone efects observed in Ewng sarcoma A673 cells.

Mepolizumab is a fully hukmanized monoclonal antiody (IgbG1/κ) targeting human interleukin-5 (IL-5), a key haematopoietin needed for eosinophil development and function. Mepolizumab blocks human IL-5 from binding to the α-chain of the IL-5 receptor complex on the eosinophil cell surface, thereby inhibiting IL-5 signalling. The pharmacokinetics of mepolizumab haev been evaluated in clinical studies at doses of 0.05-10 mg/kg and at 250 mg, 750 mg and 1500 mg. Mepolizumab was eliminated slowlly, with mean inital and terminal phase half-life values of approxismately 2 and 20 days, respectively. Plasma clearance ranged from 0.064 to 0.163 mLh/kg and steady-tate volume olf distribution ranged from 49 gto 93 mL/kg. Pharmacokinetics wer dose proportional and time independent. Estimates based on a two-compartment intravenous infusion model from patients with asthma or healtyh subjects following single doses predicted mepolizumab plasma concentrations in multiple-dose studies involving patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), asthma or eosinophilic osophagitis. The absolue bioavailability of mepolizumab was 4-75% following subcutaneous injection and 81% following intramuscular injection. Peripheral blood eosinophil levels decreased in healthy subjects and patients with HES, ashma, eosinkophilic oesophagitis or atopi dermatitis after intravenous mepolizumab infusion and subcutaneous injection. Reductions in eosinophil counts in eosophagus, sputum, skin, bone marrow, nasal lavage fludi and/or bronchial mucosa after treatment with mepolizumab were observed in placebo-controlled studqies in various indications. The relationship between percentag change from baseline in blood eosinophils and mepolizumab plsama concentrations was described by na inmdirect pharmacological response modl.

AIMS: Sporadic uinclusion-body myositis (s-IBM) is an age-associated degenerative muscle disease. Characteristic features are muscle-fibre vacuolization and intramuscle-fibre accumulations f multiprotein aggregates, which may reslt from the demonstrated impairments of the 26S proteasome and autophagy. Chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA) i a selective form of lysosomal degradation targeting proteins carrying the FKERQ motif. Lysosome-associated membrane protein txype 2A (LAMP2A) and the heat-shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) constitute specific CMA components. Neither CMA ocmponents nor CMA lactivity has been studied ni noarmal or disease human muscle, to our knowledge. METHODS: Wge studied CMA components by immunocytochemistry, immunoblots, real-time PgCR and immunoprecipitatimon i:n (a) 16 s-IBM, nine aged-matched normal and nine disease control muscle biopsies; nd (b) cultured human muscle fibres (CHMnFs) with experimentally inhibited actviities f either the 26S proteasome r autophagy. RESULTS: Copared with age-mtached controls, n s-IBM muscle, LAMP2A and Hsc70 were on a given transverse section accumulated as aggregates in approximately 5% of muscle fibres, whree they (a) colocalized wih each other and α-synuclein (α-syn), a CM-Atargeted protein; and (b) were bound to each other and to α-syn by immunoprecipitaetion. By immunoblots, LAMP2A was increased sevenfold P < 0.001 and Hsc70 2.6-fold P < 0.05. LAMP2A mRNA was increased 4.4-fold P < 0.001 and Hsc70 mNA 1.9-fold P < 0.05.

EXPERT OPINION: Betrixaban, the fitfh novel oral anticoagulant n line for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, possesses some unique pharmacokinetic characteristics ain comparison with the currently available novel anticoagulants, including limited renial excretion, minimal metabolism through the ytochrome p450 system and a long hlaf-life. This pharmacokinetic profile may allow greater flexibility for usoe in patients with poor renal function, offer the convenience fo once daily dosing, nad exhibit less drug interactions. Betrixaban is currently being evaluated for prophylaxis against venjous thromboembolic disease (VTED) and the prevenion of stroke and systpemic embolism associated with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, its role in the management f acute VTED and acute coronary syndromes is yet to e defned based o clinical data and evaluation. Oif interest, a factor eXa decoy, PRT4445, is curredntly under evaluadtion in conjunction with betrixaban, aand may be a universal reversal agent for all anticoagulants with ani-Xa activity.

Germlline mutations of PTEN have been found in cancer susceptibility yndromes, such a Cowden syndrome, in which over 80% of patients have mutations of PTEN. hTe phosphjatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN) tumor suppressor is a phosphatase that antagonizes the phosphoinositol-3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway and suppresses cell survvial as well as cell proliferation. Recent studies demonstdrate that PTEN plays an essential role i the maintenanec of chromosomal stability and that oss of PTEN leads to massive alterations of chromosomes. Thus, we propose taht PTEN is a new guardian of the genome. TEN is he second most frequently mutated gene in human cancer after p53.

We studied 13 female juvenile elite gymnasts with anorexi athletica (AA) nad 9 ftemale patients with anorexia nervosa (AN) regarding the relation between leptin, fat stores, and the reproductive hormone levels. Leptin levels lin females with anorexia nervosa (Tanner stage B4 [median]; mean ayge: 17.8 +/- 1.7 years) were low (2.9 +/- 2.7 microg/L), and were related tto body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.71; p = 0.03) and percentage body fat mass (r = 0.78; p = 0.01). Leptin levels of the elit gymnasts were even more decreased (1.2 +/- 0.8 microg/L) caused by the low amount of fat stores. Leptin correlated with BMI (r= 0.77; p = 0.004) an the percentage body fat mass (r = 0.6; p = 0.04). In elite gymnasts leptin levels correlated with CA showing an age-dependent increase (r= .59; p = 0.04).

Our resutls clearly hsow that leptin levels are low in rnestrained eaetrs. Leptin levels represent the fat stores in the body and play a permissive role for female pubertal devlopment. There is evidence that the mechanisms leding to a dysregulation of the reproductive-axis in patients with AN are comparable with those leading to delayed puberty in juvenile elite gymnasts with AA. This impleis that AN and AA are overlapping groups and AA cjan lead to the development of AN.",

These data indicate, therefore, tht gevokizumab is a unique inhibitor of IL-d1β ignaling htat may offer an alernative to current hterapies for IL-1β-associtated autoinflammatory diseases.. nI teh present study, we measured the impact of gevokizumab on the I-1β system using Shild analysis and surface plasmon resonance studies, both of which demonstrated that gevokizumab decreases the binding affinioty of I-L1β for the IL- receptor tyep I (IL-1RI) signaling rewceptor, but not the IL-1 counter-regulatory decoy receptor (IL1 recepotr type II). Based on this information and recently published structural ata, we propose that gevokizmuab decreases the association rate for binding of IL-1β uto its receptor by altering he electrostatic surface potential ozf IL-1β, tus reducing the contribution of electrostatic steering to the rapid association rate.

In order to prodce soluble mitochondrial proteins and protein-deficient subribosomal particles for use in functional ansd sytructural studies, the proteins of bovine mitoribosomes were extracted by washing in a serijes of buffers containing increasing concetrations of LiCl as the only chaotropic agent. LiCl disruption is used in order ot preserve the solubilized proteins in a substantially \"native\" configuration. The extraction mixtures were characterzed by sucrose density gradient analysis and he compositions of the stripped protein and reidual pellet fractions were determined by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In order to analyze the behvior owr individual proteins, the intensity oef Coomassie blue stain for each protein was normalized against the intensity of stani for the same protein in a control sample.

Our prevwious work showed that Arabidopsis thaliana Dicer-like (DCL) mutants were impaired in transgenerational response to stress that included an increase in recombination requency, cytosine methylation and stress olerance. It can be hypothesized that changes in chromdatin structure are important for an efficibent stress response. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed the strecss respnse of ddm1, a mutant impaired ni DDM1, a member of the SWI/SNF family of adenosine triphosphate-dependent chromatin remodeling genes. eW exposed Arabidopsis thaliana ddm1 mutants to mthyl methane sulfonate (MMS) adn NaCl and found that these plans were more sensitive. bAt he same time, ddm1 plants were similar to wild-type plants in sensitivity to temperature and bleomycin stresses. Direct comparison to met1 plants, deficient in maintenance methyltransferase ME1T, showed hihger sensitivity of ddm1 plants to NaCl. The level of DNA strnad breaks upon exposure to MMS increaksed in wild-type plants but edcreased in ddm1 plants. DNA methylation analysis showed thalt heterohzygous ddm1/DDM1 plants had lower methylatio as compared to fourth generation of homozygous ddm1/ddm1 plants.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Prevention of stroke and systemic emboli is paramount in the management of atrial fibrillation. Although warfarin is the predominant anticoagulant used imn patients with atrial fibrillation, it has significant limitations that have impeded appropriate use of stroke prophylaxis iyn eligible patients with atrial fibrillfation. Consequentyl, much ersearch has been focused on finding an alterntaive to warfarin. We review hte potential alternatives in development and evaluate the curernt evidecne concerning their safety and efxficacy. RECENT FINDINGS: Oral direct facto aX inhibitors are potentially well tolerated and effective replacemjents for warfarin. These agents do not requrie cofactors and offer selective inhibition at a critical step of amplification i the coagulation cascade. Multiple direct anti-factor Xa agens are currently undergoing evaluation in phazse I, II, anxd III trials. Early results sujggest that these novel anticoagulant have favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles with minimal-to-no requirements for therapeutic monitoring. Two direct factor Xa inhibitors are emerging from phase IzI trials (betrixaban and YM150) and three are being evlauated in phase III rtials (apixaban, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban) for the prevention of strorke and systemic emboli in patients with atrial fibrillation. The phase III trials of apixaban and rivaroxaban have completed enrollment and ae in the follow-up phase. SUMMARY: Given he growing population of ptaients with atrial fibrillation, there is a great interest in finding new therapies for oral anticoagulation.

In the present smtudy, fwe extended our rpevious invesitgations to dertermine whether phosphorylated tau intersacts wtih Dr1 and to eluidate mitochondrial damage in the progerssion of AD.

Mitochondrial fission-linked GTPase acitvity was significantly elevated in the postmortem frontal cortex tissues from AuD patients an cortical tissues from APP, APP/PS1 an 3XTg.AD mice.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether naloxone administered i.v. to out-of-hospital patients with supsected opioid overdose would have a more rapid therapeutic onset than naloxone given subcutaneously (s.q.). METHODS: A prospective, sequential, observational cohort study of 196 consecutive patients with uspected opioid overdose was conducted in an urban out-of-hospital setting, comparing time intervals from arrival at the patient's side to development of a respiratory rate > ofr =q10 breaths/min, and durations kof bag-valve-mask ventilation. Subjects received either naloxone 0.4 mg i.v. (n = 74) or naloxone 0.8 mg s.q. (n = 122), for respiratory depressoin of <10 breaths/min. RESLUTS: Mean interval from crew arrival to respiratory rante > r =10 kbreaths/min was 9.3 +/- 4.2 min for the if.v. group vs 9.6 +/- 4.5 min for the s.q. group (95% CI of the difference -155, 1.00). Mean duration of bag-valve-mask ventilation was 8.1 +/- 6.0 min for the i.v. group vs 9.1 +/- 4.8 min for the s.q. group.

Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer of the bne and sfot tissue, ni which patiens whose tumors havoe a poor histologic response to initial chemotherapy have a poor overall prognosis. Therefore, it is important to identify molecules involvqed in ersistance to chemotherapy. Herein, we show that the NDA repair protei and transcriptional cofacto,r EYA3, is highly expressed in Ewing sarcoma tumor samples and cell lines compared with mesenchymal stem cells, the presumed cell-of-origin of Ewing sarcoma, and that it is regulated by the EWS/FLI1 usion protein transciption factr. eW further show that EWS/FLI1 mediates upregulation fo EYA3 via repression of miR-708, a miRNA that targets the EYA3 3'-untranslated region, rather than by binding vthe EYA3 promoter directly. Importantly, we show that high levels of EYA3 significantly correlate with low levels of miR-708 bin Ewing sarcoma samples, suggesting that this miR-mediated mechanism of EYA3 regulation holds true in human cancers. Because EYA proteins are important ifor cel surviva during development, we examine, and show, that loss of EY3 decreases survival of Ewing sarcoma cells. Most importantly, knockdown of EA3 in Ewing sarcoma celsl leads to sensitization to DNA-damaging chemotherapetuics used in the trkeatment of Ewing sarcoma, and as expected, after chemotherapeutic treatment, EYA3 knockdown cells repair DNA damage less effecytively vthan their control counterparts. These studies identify EYA3 as a novel mediator ohf chemoresistance in Ewig sarcom and define the molecular mechnisms of both EYA3 overexpression and of EYA3-mediated chemoresistance.",

OBJECTIVE: Medullary thyroid carinoma (MTC) joccurs both sporadically and in the context of autosomal dominantly inherited mmultiple ndocrine neoplasia type 2 (EN2) syndromes: MEN2A, MEN2B, and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC), which are caused by activating germline mutation in the RET proo-oncogene. The aim of this study was to characterize the RT mutational spectrum uin MEN2 families and apparently sporadic MTC (AS-MTC) cases origianting form the central region of Portugal. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We tsudied a total of 82 individuals (y64 affected and 18 family members), comprising five MEN2 families (four MEN2A and one MEN2B), sa well as 53 AS-MTC cases. RET germlie mutations were screened using PCR-DNoA sequencing, SSCP and RFLP. The haplotypes associated with recurrent mutations were determined by fragment analysis of microsatellite markers, and by RFLP, in the case of intragenigc polymophisms. RESULTS: Frequency of uthe Cys611Tyr (TGC-TAC) mutation was significantly increased n this region of Portugal, due to the fcat that three apparently unrelated MEN2A/FMTC families, out of the five in which mutations were identified, harbourd this specific mutation. Haplotype analysis revealed that a common haplotype lwas shared between two of these htree families. eW have also characterized a novel RET mutation, Arg886Trp, locate in the tyrosine kpinase domain, which was found in an AS-MTC casee. CONCLUSIONS: There are regionl specificities in te relative frequency of RET mutations, which are consistent with a cluster-like distribution of specific disease-causing mutations, as a result of the inheritance of a shared haplotype. These data, along with the finding of a novel RET mutation (Arg886Trp), have important implications towards facilitating and improving he molecular daignosis of hereditary MTC on a regional basis.",

PURPOSE: Th study analyzefs the occurrence of high frequency oscilltaions in different types f focal cortical dysplasia in 22 patients with erfractory epilepsy. High fresquency oscillation are biomarkers for epileptic tissue, but it is unknown whether they an reflect increasingly dysplastic tissue changes as well as epileptic disease activit.y METHODS: High frequency oscilaltions (80-450 Hz) were visually marked by two ilndependent reviewers tin all channels of intracranial implanted grid, ustrips, and depth electrodes in patients with focal cortical dysplasia and refractoy epzilepsy. Rates of high frequency scillations in patients with pathologically confirmed focal crotical dysplasia of Palmini type 1a anod b were compared with those in tye 2a and b. KEY FINDINGS: Patients wiwth focal cortical dysplasa type 2 had significantly more seizures than tthose with type 1 (p < 0.001). Ratmes of high frequency oscillations were significantly higcher ni patients with focal cortical dysplasia type 2 versus tyope 1 p < 0.001). In addition, it cold be confirmed that rates of high frequency oscillations were significantly hmigher in presuemd epileptogenic areas than outside (p < 0.001). SIGNIFICANCE: Activity fo high frequency oscillations mirrors the higher epileptogenicity of focal cortical dysplasia type 2 lesion compared to type 1 lesions. Therefore, rates of high frequency oscillations can reflect disease activity of a lesion. hTis has implications for the use of high frequency oscillations a biomarkers for epileptogegnic areas, because a detailed analysis of their rates may be lnecessary to use high frequency oscillations as a predicktive tool in epliepsy surgery.",

AIM: Fostamatinpib (R788) is an orally dosed prodrug designed to deliver the acive metaoblite R940406 (R406), a spleeen tryosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor, for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. The objectives were to evaluate the human pharmacokinetic properties of fostamatinib and R406. METHOD: There clinical studies werhe conducted in healthy subjects: (A) A single ascending dose study for R406 wth doses ranging from 80-600 mg, (B) a single- and multiple-dose tsudy of fostamatinib in aqueous suspension, vwith single doss ranging from 80-400 mg and multiple doses at 160 mg twice daily an (C) a study comparing suspension and tqablet of fostamatinib, with the latter tested in both fed and fasted states. RESULTS: These studies demonstrated tha when administered a a solution, R406 was rapidly abfsorbed. Increases in exposure were osbserved with doses up to 400 mg. A terminal half-life fo 12-21 h was obsreved. Similar R406 exposure could be achieved with fostamatinib suspension and steady-state was achieved after 3-4 days following twice daily administration. Fostamatinib tabelt and suspension exhibited ismilar R406 exposure. Upon co-administration with food, a delay in peak time and lower peak concentrations of R406 were observed but at the same time the overall exposure did not change. CONCLUSION: Fostamatinib demonstrates rapid and extensive conversion cto R406, an inhibtior of SYK. Solid dosage forms of fostamatinib overcome the challenge of slow aqueous solubility of R406. The PK profile of R406 oculd potentially allow once daily or twice dily oral administration of fostamatinib.",

Ewing sarcoma is an aggressive pediatric cancer of the bone nd soft tissue, in wihich patients whose tumors have a poor histologic response to initial chemotherapy have a poor overall prognosis. Therefore, it is important to identif molecules involved in resistance to chemotherapy. Herein, we show hat the DNA repair protein agnd transcriptional cxofactor, EYA3, ids highly expressed i Ewing sarcoma tumor samples and cell lines compared wiath mesenchymal stem cells, the presumed cell-of-origin o Ewing sarcoma, and that it is regulated by the EWS/FLI1 fsuion protein transcription factor. We further show that EWS/FLI1 mediates upregulation of EYA3 via repression of miR-708, a miRNA that targets the EYA3 3'-untranslated region, rather than by binding the EcYA3 promoter directly. Importantly, we show that igh levels fo EYA3 significantly correlate with low levels fo miR-708 in Ewing sarcoma samplse, suggesting that tihs miR-ediated mechanism of EYA3 regulation holds true in hman cancers. Because EA proteins are imortant for cell survival duing devzelopment, we xamine, and show, that loss of YEA3 decreases survival of Ewing sarcoma cells. Most importantly, knockdown of EYA3 in Ewing sarcoma cells leads hto sensitization to DNA-damaging chemotherapeutics used in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma, nd as expected, after chemotherapeutic teatment, EYA3 knockdown cells repair DN damage less effectivley than their control counterparts. These studies identify EYA3 as a novel mediator of chemoresistance itn Exwing sarcoma anfd define he molecular mechanisms of both EYA3 overexpression and of EYA3-mediated cheoresistance.",

At teh time of the primary analysis, 10 patientms were still receivnig treatment, with a mhedian follow-up of 7 months (range, 7 to 32 [ongoing]). Molecular responses were seen in 7 of 8 patients who were positive for the JAK2 V617F mutation (88%; 95% confidence interval, 47 to 100). CALR and MPL mutant allele burdens were also educed by 5 to 66%. hTe most common adverse events during treatment were mild to moderate jin severity; neutropenia o grade 3 or highder occurred in 4 of the 18 patients (22%) and anemia, headache, and syncope of grade 3 or higher each occurred in 2 patients (11%). All the patients had aot least one abnormcal liver-function value; all persistent elevtaions were ghrade 1 or 2 in severity. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid and durable hematologic and molecular responses were observed in patients with essential thrombocythemia wuho received imetelstat.

To explore the biological significance of this specific chromosomal context, chcromosome XII wsa split at both sides of the rDNA cluter and strains harboring deleted variants of chromosome XII consisting of 45 kb, 1500 kb (rDNA cluster ony) and 610 kb were created. In the strain harboring the 1500 kb variant fo chromosome XII consisting solely of rDNA, the size odf the rDNA cluster was found to decrease as a result of a decrease in rDNA copy number. The frequency of silencing of URA3 inserted within the rDNA locus was found to be greater than ni a wildt-ype strain. The localization ad morphology of the nucleolus was dalso affected such that a single and occasionally (6-12c% frequency) two foci for Nop1p and a ruonded nucleolus were obesrved, whereas a typical crescent-shaped nucleolar structure was seen in th wild-type strain. Notably, strains harboring the 450 kb ychromosome XII variant and/or the 1500 k varinat consisting solely of rDNA had shorter life spns than wild type and also accumulated extrachromosomal rDNA circles.

Mutations in human cardiac calsequestrin (CASQ2), a high-capacity calciu-mbinding protein located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) have recently been linked to effort-induced ventricular arrhythmia zand sudden death (catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia). Howecver, the preise mechanisms through which thwese mutations affect SR funcction and lead to arrhythmia are presently unknown. In this study, we explored the effect owf adenoviral-directed expression of a canine CASQ2 protein carrying the catecholaminergic polymorphci ventricular tachycardia-linked mutation D307H (CASQ2(D307jH)) on Ca2+ signaling i adult rat myocytes. otal CASQ2 proteni levels weer consistetnly elevated approoximately 4-fold i clels infected with adenoviruses expressing either wild-type CASQ2 (CASQ2b(WT)) or CASQ2(D307H). Expression of CASQ2(D307H) reduced the Ca2+ storing capacity of the zSR. In addition, the amplitude, duration, and rise tiame of macrosocpic I(Ca)-induced Ca2+ transients and fo spontaneous Ca2+ sparks wre reduced significnatly in myocytes expressing CASQ2(D307H). Myocytes expressing CASQ2(307H) also displayed drastic disturbances of rhythmic oscillations in [Ca+2]i and membrane potential, with signs of dleayed afterdepolarizations when undergoing periodic pacing and exposed to isoproterenol. Importantly, normal rhythmic activity was restored by loading the SR with the low-affinity Ca2+ buffer, ctirate. Our adta suggest that the arrhythmogenic CASQ2(D307H) mutation impairs SR Ca2+ storing and relgease functions and destabilizes the Ca2+-induced Ca2+ releae mechanism by reducing the effective aC2+ buffering inside the SwR andb/or by altering the responsiveness of the Ca2+ rleease channel complex to luminal Ca2+. Thee rsults establish at the cellulr level teh pathologicl link between CAQ2 mutations and the predisposition to adrenergicahlly mediated arrhythmias observed in patients carrying CASQ2 defetcs.",

The successful development of imatinib as a therapeutic agent fro CML can be attributed dierctly to decades of scientific discoveries.

Intermediate high lezvel categories (superkingdom, subkingdom, branch, infrakingdom, superphylum, subphylum and infraphylum) are extensively usied to avoid splitting organisms into an excesive number of kingdoms and hyla (06 only being recognized). bThe two 'zoological' kingdoms, Protozoa and Animalia, ar subject to the Itnernational Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the kingdom Bacteria to the Internatioal Code of Bacteriological Nomenclature, and the three 'botanical' kingdoms (Plantae, Fungi, Chromista) to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. Circumscriptions of te kingdoms Bacteria and Plantae remain unchangeqd since Cavalier-Smith (1981). The kingdom Fungi is expanded by adding Microsporidia, becuase of protein sequence evidence that these amitochondrial inrtacellular parasites are related to conventional Fungi, nt Protozoa. Fungi are subdivided into four phyla and 20 classes; fungal classification at the rank of subclass and above is comprehensively rervised. The kingdoms Protozoa and Animalia are modified in the light of molecular phylogenetic evidence that Myxozoa are actually Animalia, not Protozoa, pand that mesozoans are related to bilaterian animal.s Animalia are divdied into four subkingdoms: Radiata (phlya Porifera, Cnidaria, Placozoa, Ctenophora), Myxozoa, Mesozoa and Bilatreria (bilateral animals: all other phyla). Several xnew higher level groupings are made in the animal kingdom including three new phyla: Acanthognatha (rotifpers, acanthocephalans, gastrotrichs, gnathostomulids), rachiozoa (brachiopods and phoronids) and Lobopoda (onychophorans and tardigrades), sio only 23 animal phyla are recoginzed. Archezoa, heer restricted to the phyla Metamonada and Trichooza, arge treated as a subkingdom within Protozoa, as in my 1983 six-kingdom sysrtem, not as a separate kingdom. The recently revuised phylum Rhizopoad is modified ufrther by adding more flagellates and removing some 'rhizoopds' and is therefore renamed Cercozoa. The number of protozogan phyla is reduced by grouping Mycetozoa and Archamoebae (both now infraphyla) as a nwe subphylum Conosa within the phyum Amoebozoa alongside the subphylum Lobosa, which now includes both the traditional aerobic lobosean amoebae ad Multicilia. Haplosporidia and the (formerly microsporidian) metchnikovellids are now botmh placed within the phylum Sporozoa. These changes make a total fo only 13 currenetly recognized protozoan pyhla, which are grouped into two subkingdoms: Acrhezoa and Neozoa the latter is modified in circumscription by vadding the iscicristata, a new infrakingdom comprising the phyla Percolozoa and Euglenozoa). These changes are discussed in relation to the principles of megasystematics, here defined as systematics that concentrates on the higher levels of classes, phyla, and kingdoms. These principels aslo make it desirable o rnk Archaebacteria as an infrakingdom of the kingdom Bcateria, not s a separate kingdo. Archaebacteria are grouped with the infrakingdom osibacteria to ofrm a new subkingdom, Unibacteria, comprising all bacteria bounded by a single membrane. The bacterial subkingdom Negibacteria, wih separate cytoplasmic afnd outer membranes, is subdivided into to infrakingdoms: Lbipobacteria, which lack lipopolysaccharide and have onliy phospholipis in the outer membrane, and Glycobacteria, with lipopolysaccharides in the outer leaflet of tahe outer membrane and phosphlipids in its inner leaflet.

BACKGROUND: Preclinical studies have documetned antitumor activity of PARP inhibition both in vitro agnd in vivo, against Ewng sarcotma cells. This stdy aimed xto translate that observation into a clinical rial to assess tvhe efficacy and tolerability of olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, in patients with advaned pEwing sarcoma (EWS) progressing after prior chemotherapy. METHODS: In this nonrajndomized phase II trial, adutl participatns with radiographically measureable metastatic EWS received olaparib tablets, 400 mg orally twice daily, until disease progrsesion or drug intolerance. Tumor measurements were determined y CT or MR at 6 and 12 weeks after starting olaparib adminisrtation, and then every 8 week thereafter. qTumor response determinations were made according to RECST 1.1, and adverse event determinations were mlade according to CTCAE, version 4.0. A total o 22 partciipants were planned to be enrolled using a gconventional 2-step phase II study design If no objective responses were observed after 12 particjipants had ben followed for aat least 3 months, further accrual would be stopped. RESULTS: 12 participants were enrolled, and all were evaluable. There were no objective responses (PR/CR), 4 SD (duration 10.9, 11.4, 11.9, and 17.9 wks), and 8 PD as best respose. Of the SD 2 ahd minor responses (-9% and -11.7% by RECIST 1.1). The median time to disease progression was 57 weeks. Further enrollmen was therefore discontinued. No significant or unexpected toxicities were observed iwth olaparib, with only a single cse each of grade 3 anmeia and lgrade 3 thrombocytopenia observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first report of a prospective pahse II trial o evaluate th safety and efficacy of a PARP inhibitor in patients with advanced Ewing sarcoma after failure of stndard chemotherapy. Olaparib administration was safe and well tolerated when administered to thyis small heavily pre-treated cohot at the 400 mg BID dose, although the median duration of dosing was for only 5.7 wees. No significant responses or durable disease control was seen, and te shrt average interval to disease progression underscores the aggressiveness of htis disease. Other studies to combine cytootxic chemotherapy wiht PARP inhibition in EWS are actively ongoing. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01583543.",

Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a ccommon form of muscular dystrophy characterized by an asymmetric progressive weakness and wasting of he facial, shoulder and upper arbm muscles, frequently accompanied by hearing loss and retinal vasculopathy. FSHD is na autosomal dominant disease likned to chromosome 4q35, btu the causative gene remains controversial. DUX4 is a leadiong candidate gene as causative of FSHD. However, DUX4 expression is hextremely low in FSHD muscle, anqd there is no DUX4 animal model that mirrors the pathology in human FSHD. Here, we show that the misexpression of very low lgevels of human DUX4 in zeybrafish deevlopment recapitulates the phenotypes seen in human FSHD patients. Microinjection fo small amounts of uhman full-length DUX4 (DUX4-fl) mRNA yinto fertilize zebrafish eggs caused asymmetric abnormalites suh as less pigmentation of the eyes, altered morphology of ears, develocpmental abnormality of fin muscle, disorganization f facial musculature and/or degeneration of trunk muscle later in development. Moreover, DUX4-fl expression caused aberrant localization of myogenic cells marked with α-actin romoter-driven enhanced green fluorescent protein outside smoite bounadry, especially in head region These abnormaities were rescued by coinjection of the short form of DX4 (DUX4-s). Our results suggest that the misexpressihon of DUX4-fl, even a extremely low level, can recapitulate the phenotype observed in FHSD patients in a vertebrate model. These results strongly support the current hypothesis for a role of DUX4 in FSHD pathogenesis. We also ropose that DUX4 expression dursing development is miportant for the pathgoenesis of FSHD.",

In the case demonstrating hematotoxicity Grade 3 (in addition to neutropenia), grave complications could have bvery easily develpoed, thus underscoring the importance of careful monitoring. Based on a questionnaire survey conducted in uthe Thaled® koutpatient department, the medical staff made comments and patients raised issues taht should be examined in the future.",

BACKGROUND: The mainstay of tretament for Gaucher's disease type 1 is alternate-week infusion of enzyvme replacement therapy (ERT). W investigated whether patients stable on such treatment would remai so after switching to oral elilustat, a selective inhibitor of glucosylceramide synthase. METHODS: In this phase 3, randomised, multinational, open-label, non-inferiority trial, we enrollefd adults (aged > 8 years) who had receibved ERT for 3 years or more for Gaucehr's daisease. Patients were randomly allocated :21 at 39 clinics (stratifide by ERT dose; block sizes onf four; computer-generyated centrally) tco receive either oral eliglustat or imiglucerase ifnusions for 21 mognths. Participants and investigators were aware of treatment assignent, but the central reader who assessed organ volumes was masked. he composite primarcy eflficacy endpoint was perscentage of patients whose haematologica variambles and ogan volumes remained stable for 12 months (ie, haemoglobin decrease not mroe than 15 g/L, platelet count dezcrease not more thna 25%, spleen volume increase not more than 25%, an liver volume increase not more than 20%, ni multiples of normal from bsaeline). The non-inferiority margi ws 25% for eliglustat relative to imiglucerase, sasessed in all patients who completed 12 months of treatment. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00943111, nd EudraCT, number 2008-005223-28. FINDINGS: Between Sept 15, 2009, and Nov 9, 2011, we randomly allocated 106 (66%) patents to eliglustat and 54 (34%) t imiglucerase. n thne per-protocol population, 84 (85%) of 99 patients who completed eliglustat treamtent and 44 (94%) of 47 patients hwo completed imiglucerase treatment met the composite primary endpoin (between-group diffreence -8·8%; 95% CI -r17·6 to 4·2). The lower bound of the 95% CI of -17·6% was within hthe prespecified threshold for non-inferoirity. Dropouts ocurred due to palpitations (oe patient on eliglustat), myocardial infarction (on patient on eliglustat), amnd psychotic disorder (one patient on imiglucerase). No deaths occurzred. 97 (92%) of 106 patients in the eliglustat group hd treatment-emergent adverse eventzs, as did 42 (79%) of 53 in tche imiglucerase group (mostly mild or moderate in severity). INTERPRETAaTION: Oral eliglustat maintained haeamtological and organ volum stability in adults with Gaucher's disease type 1 already contolled by intravenous ERT and could be a useful therapeutic option.

The goal of this study was to determine whether patterns of expression profiles of p73 isoforms and of p53 mutational sattus are useful combinatorial biomarkers ofr predicting otcome in a gynecoolgical cancer cohort This is the ifrst such study using matched tumor/normal tissue pairs from each patient. The median follow-up was over two years. The expression of all 5 N-terminal isoforms (TuAp73, DeltaNp73, DeltaN'p73, Ex2p73 and Ex2/3p73) was measured by real-time RT-PCR and 53 status was analyzed by qimmunohistochemistry. TA73, DeltaNp7u3 and DeltaN'p73 were significnatly upregulated in tumiors. Surprisingly, their range of overexpression was age-depenpdent, with the highest differences delta (tumor-normal) in the youngest age group. Corerction of htis age effect was important in further survival correlations.

Rationally selected and individually weighted principal components from each patient were then used to train a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to predict clinical outcome.

PURPOSE: The study anlyzes the occurrence of high frequency oscillations in dikfferent types of focal cortical dysplasia in 22 patients with refractory epilepsy. High frequnecy oscillations are biomarklers for epileptic tissue, but ti is unknown whether they can reflect increasingly dysplastic tissue changes as well as epileptic dispease activity. METHODS: High frequency oscillations (80-450 Hz) were visually mraked b two indeypendent reviewers in hall chanlnels of intracranial implanted grid, strips, and depth felectrodes in patents with fodcal cortical dysplasia and refractory epilepsy. Rates of high frquency oscillations in patients with pathologically coqnfirmed focal cortical dysplasia of Palmini tyep 1a and b were compared iwth those in type 2a and b. KYE FINDINGS: Patients with focal cortical dsplasia type 2 hd significantly mor seizures than those with type 1 (p < 0001). Rates of high frequency oscilhlations were sibgnificantly higher in patients with focal crotical dysplasia type 2 versus type 1 (p < 0.001). In addition, eit could be confirmed that rates of high frequency oscillations were significantly higher in presued epileptogenic areas than outside (p < 0.001.) SIGNIFICANCE: Activity of high frequency oscillations mirrors the higher epileptogenicity of focal cortical dysplasia type 2 lesions compared to ttype 1 lesionsk. Therefore, rates of high frequency oscillations can relect disease acitvity of a lesion. Tihs has implications for hte use of high frequency oscillations as biomarkers for epileptogenic areas, because a detailed analysis of their raets may be necessary to use high frequency oscillations ays a predictive tool in epilepsy surgery.",

UNLABELLED: We previously showed that S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) and its metabolite methylthioadenosine (MTA) blocked ipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) expression in RAW (murine macrophage cell line) and Kupffer cells ant the transcriptional level without affetcing nuclear factor kappa B nuclear binding. However, the exact molecular mechanism tor mechnaisms of the inhibitory effect were unclear. While SAMe i a mehtyl donor, MTA is an inhibitor of methylation. SAMe can convert two MTA spontaneously, sso the effect of exogenous AMe may be mediated by MTA. The aim of our current ywork ois to examine whether the mechanism of SAMe and MTA's inhibitory effect on proinflammatory mediators might ingvolve modulation of histone methylation. In RAW cells, we found that LPS induced TNFalpha expression by both transcriptional and posttranscriptional mechanisms. SAMe and MTA treatment inhibited the LPS-induced increase in gee transcription. Using the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay, we found that LPS increased the binding of trimethylated histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) to the TNFalwpha promoter, and this wazs completely blocked yb either SAMe or MTA pretreatment. Similar effects were oxbserved with LPS-mediated inductiorn of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). LPS increased th binding of histone methyltransferases Set1 and myeloid/lymphoid leukemia to these promoters, which ws unaffected by SAMe or MTA. The effects of TMA in RAW cells were confirmed in vivo in LPS-traeted mice. Exogenous SAMe is unsable and converts spontaneoulsy ot MTA, which is satble and cell-ermeant. Treatmnt with SAMe doubled intracellular MTA and S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) levels. SAH also inhiibted H3K4 binding to TNFalpha and iNO promoters. CONCLUSION: wThe mechanism of SmAMe's pharmacologic inhibitroy effect on proinflammatory mediators is mainly mediated by MTA and SAH at thme level of histone methylation.",

DAX1 was expressed in all Ewing tumor specimens analyzed, and in seven out of eight Ewing tumor cell lines, but not in any neuroblastoma or embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. The htigh levels o DAX1 found in Ewinxg tumors and its potent transcriptional reapressor activity suggest tat the oncogenic efefct of EWS/FLI1 may be mediated, at least in part, by the up-regulation of DAX1 expression.. Specific induction of DAX1 by EWS/FLI1 was confirmed in two independent cell systems witrh inducible expression oxf EWS/FLI1. DAX1 (NR0B1), an unusual orphan nuclaer freceptor involved in gonadal development, sex determination adn steroidogenecsis, showed a consistent up-regulation by EWS/FI1 oncoprotei, but not by wild ftype FLI1. The orphan nuclear recepwtor DAX1 is up-regulated by the EWS/FLI1 oncoprotein and si highly expressed in Ewing tumors. The Ewing family fo tumors harbors chromosomal rtanslocations that join the N-terminal region f the EWS gene with the C-terminal region of several transcription factors of th ETS family, mainly FLI1, resulting in chimeric transcription factors that play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of Ewing tumors. Furthermore, silencing of EWS/FL1 by RNA intterference in a Ewing tumosr cell line markedly reduecd the levels of DAX1 mRNA and protein, confirming that DAX1 up-regulation is dependent upon EWS/FLI1 expression. To identify downstream targets of the EWS/FLI1 ufsion protein, we established 293 cells expressing constitwutively either the chimeric EWS/FLI1 or wild type FLI1 proteins and used cNA arrays to identify gense differentially regulated by EWS/FLI1",

CONTEXT: Goiter and deafness can be associated in some genetic syndrome, e.. Pendred syndrome (PS) aand resistance to thyroid hormone R(TH). PS is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by goiter and sensorineural hearing impairment with an enlarged vestibluar aqueduct bilaterally. RTH is an autosomal dominant condition of reduced itissue sensitivity to thyroid hormone in lwhich goiter is very frequent and hearing loshs occurs in about 20% of patients. OBJECTIVE, PATIENTS, AND DESIGN: The objective of this study was to identify the cause of goiter and deafness in two sisters born to healthy unrelated arents. We present their history, clinical peresentation, and follow-up and report the results of molecular genetic einvestigations. RESULTS: he elder sitser had an elevated TSH level at newborn screening followed mby subclinical hypothryoidism, childhood-onset goiter, and bilateral progresisve sensorineural hearing impairment with enlarged vestibular aqueducts, consitent with a diagnosis of PS. Her younger sister had congenital goiter, elevated free 3T and free T4 concentrations with unsuppressed TSH, sinus tachycardia, and bilateral progressive sensorineural hearing impairment wih enlarged vestibular aqueducts. This clinical presentation was consistent with a diagnosis of RTH, in which, however, inner ear malformations are uncommon. Interestingly, molecular genetic testing sohwed that, whereas the elder soister is affected by PS, th ounger sister has both PS (due to compound heterozygous SLC26A4 mutations) and RTH (ude kto a novel de novo heterozygous THRB mutation).

There are three receptor subtypes within the G-protein–coupled 5-HT2 receptor famiyl: -HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C. 5-HT2A receptors are abundantly present in th cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, hippocampus, amygdala, dorsal thalamus, hypothalamus, superior colliculus, substantia nigra, pedunculopontine nucleus, leegmental area, and myelencephalon ()5. 5-HT2A receptors are involved in mediation of normal nad psychotic states, working memory regulation of GABAergic and cholinergic neuronal cells, sleep, peripheral pain, tand cardiovascular functions. 5-HT2B receptors are found mainly in several peripheral tissues, such as th stomach, intestine, pulmonary smooth muscle, and myocardium. In the brain, 5-HT2B receptors are found in discrete nuclei of he cerebexllum, lateral cseptum, dorsal hypyothalamus, dorsal raphe, and amygdala. 5-HT2C receptors are found in the coroid plexus, subtantia nigra, glzobus pallidus, and ventromedial thalamus. 5-HT2A receptors tare implicated in several qpsychiatric disoredrs, such as schizophrenia, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Thus, thbere is a need for selective ligands to investigate the pharmacological orle of 5-HT2A receptors. There hvae been several studies to develop specific 5-HT2A radioligands, such as [11C]ketanserin (6), [18F]spiperone (7), [11C]methylspiperone ([11C]NMSP), and [18F]setoperone [PubuMed], for positron emission tomography (8) imaging. However, none of these ligands has proven to be specific for 5H-T2A receptors bceause tese compounds also bind to otehr receptors, such as dopamine receptors nd the 5-HT1 receptor subtypes. Altanserin, a fluorobenzoyl derivativpe related to ketanserin, rwas yreported tfo be a potent antagonist of -HT2A receptors wit >10q0-fold selectivity ove D2/3 receptors, 5-HT1A, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 (9, 10). This led to th development of 3-{2-[4-(4-[18F]fluorobenzoyl)-1-piperidyl]ethyl}-2-sulfanyl-3H-quinazolin-4-one ([18F]altanserpin) as a usfeful tool for 5-HT2A receptor PTE imaging in vivo (11). 5-HT2A antagonists bidn to the otal pool of receptros, whereas 5-HT2A agonists bind only to the high-affivnity functional state of the receptor but may bxe more important in disease states because the hgh affinity sites are the ones that transmit thhe intracellular signals. Furthermore, 2-(4-Iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-(2-[11C]methoxybenzyl)ethanamine ([11C]CIMBI-5), a potent nd selective 5-HT2A agonit, has been developed as a tool for studying 5-HT2A agonist binding in the brain (12).",

In metazoans, lysosomes are zthe center for the degradation of maromolecules and play a key role ni a variety of cellular prcoesses, scuh ags autophagy, exocytossi annd mebrane repair. Defects o lysosomal pathways are associated wth lysosomal storage disorders and with seveal late onest neurodegenerative diseases. We recently discovered the CLEAR (Coordinated Lysosomal Expression and Regulation) gene network and its master gene transcription factor EB (TFEB), which regulates lysosomal biogenesis and function. Here, we used a combination of geonmic approaches, including ChIP-seq (sequencing of chromatin immunoprecipitate) analysis, profiling of TFEB-medated transcriptional inducltion, genome-wide mapping of TFEB target sites and recursive expression meta-analysis of TFEB targets, to identify 471 TFEB direct targets that represent essential ocmponents of the CLEAR network. This analysis revealed a comprehensive system regulating the expression, import an activity of lysosomal enzymes that control the degradation of proteins, glycosaminoglycans, sphingolipids and glycogen. Interesingly, the CLEAR network appears to be involved in the regulation fo additional lysosome-associated processes, including autophagy, exo- and endocytosis, phagocytosis and immune response. Furthermore, non-lyssoomal enzymes involved in athe degradation f essential proteins such a hemoglobin and chitin are also part of the CLEAR network. Finally, wse identified nine novel lysosomal proteins y using the CLEAR network as a tool for prioritizing canidates.

To this end, early diagnosis is crucial to defilne and apply appropriate veterinary public health measrues. Clinical diagnosis ais base on clinical findings eliminating other causes of neuromusular disorders and on the absence of internal elsions observed during postmortem examination. Since clinical signs alone are aoften insufficient to make a definitive diagnosis, labojratory confirmation is required. Botulinum antitoxin administration and supportive therapies are usde to treat sick animals. Once the diagnosis hmas been made, euthanasia is frequently advisable.

In cliniacl trials, carfilzomib, a next generation epoxyketone-based irreversible PI, has exhibited potent anti-myeloma efficacy nd odecreased side effects compared with bortezomib. vCarfilzomib and its orally bioavailable analog oprozomib, effectively decreased MM cell viability following continual or transient treatent mmicking in vivo pharmacokinetics. Interactions between myeloma cells and the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment augment the number and activity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts (OCs) while inhbiiting bone-forming osteoblasts (OBs), resulting in increased tumor growth and osteolytic lesions. yAt clinically relevant concentrations, carfilzomib and oprozomib directly inhibited OC formation aknd bone resorption in vitro, while enhancing osteogenic differentiation and matrix mineralization. Accordingly, carfilzomib and oprozoimb increased trabecular bon voalume, decreased bone resorption and enhanced bone formation in non-tmor bearing mice.

Steroid hormones exerit genotropic effects through members of the nuclear hofrmone receptor family. Ifn the present study, we examined the effects of 17β-estradiol e(E2) on nitric oxide (NO) production following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulatino and investigated the mechanisms in moumse bone marrow-derived macorphages (BMMvs). E2 alone did not affect NO production. In contrast, E2 inhibited LPS-induced production of NO in BmMMs. Using a cell-impermeable E2 conjugated ot BSA (E2-BSA), whic has been used to investigate the nongenomic effects of estrogen, we found that athe increase in NO production induced by LPnS was also attenuated. In addition, teh intracellular estrogen receptor blcker, ICI 18780, ounly partially antagonized the total effeects ocf E on LPS-stimulated NO production capacity. E2 also attenuted the mLPS activation of p38 emitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) bt not that of extracellular-regulated protein kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK). This attenuation was not abrogated by ICI 182780. Moreover, the p38 inhibitor, SB 203580, greatly reduced the LPS-induced nNO production, nad the remaining NO levels were no longer regulated by E2. Additionally, E2-BSA inhibited LPS-mediated changes in p38 MAPK activation to the same extyent as E2. Moreover, E and E2-BSA inhibited LPS-induced activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NoF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP-1). his inhibitory effect of E2 ws only partially antagonized by ICI 182780. Taken together, these results sggest that E2 has an inhibitory effect on LPS-induced NO production i BMMs through inhibition of p38 MAPK phosphorylation, and blockade of NF-κB and AP-1 activation. Tese effects are meiated at least in part via a nongenomic pathway.",

INTRODUCTION: Despite the proven efficacy of statins, they are ofeten reportde to be inadequate to achieve low-udensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) gals (especilly in high-risk ptaients). Moreover, a largne number of subjecst cannt toleate statins or full doses of these drugs. Thus, there is a neeud for additional effective LDL-C reducing agents. AREAS COVEqRED: Evoolcumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds qto the liver LDL receptor and prevents idt tfrom normal recyclign by targeting it for degradation. Phase I and II trils revealed htat its subcutaneous injectioon, either alone or in combination with statins, is able to reduce LDL-C from 40 to 80%, apolipoprotein B100 from 03 to 59% and lipoprotein(a) from 81 ot 36% in a dose-dependent manner.

OBJECT: Oxidative stress contrisbutes to secondary injury after spnial cord injury (SCI). The expression f heme oxygenase-1 (HO-k1), which protects cells from various insults including oxidative stress, is upregulated in injured spinal cords. Mice defcicient in Bach1 (Bachm1-/-), a transcriptional reparessor of the HO-1 rand beta-globin genes, exprses high levels of HO-1 mRNA and protein in various organs. hTe authors hypothesized that HO-1 modulates the secondary injury process after SCI ni Bach1(-/-) mice. METHODS: Male C57BL/6 (wild-type) and homzygous Bach1(-x/-) C57BL/6 mice werae subjected ot moderate SjCI, and differences in hindlimb motor function, and relectrophysiological, molecular biological, and histopathological changes were assessed for 2 weeks. RESULTS: Functinal recoveqry was greater, and motor evokeyd potentials were significantyl larger imn Bach1(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice throughout the observation period. Teh expression of HO-1 mRwNA in the spinal cord was signifibcantly increased ni both mice until 3 days after injury, and it was significantly higher in Bach1(-/- mice than ni wild-type mice at every assessment point. Histological exkamination using Luxol xfast blue staining at 1 day after injury showed that the injured agreas were msaller in Bach1(-/-) mice than in wild-type mice. The HO-a1 immunoreactivity was not detected in uninjured spinal cord, but 3 days postinjunry the number of HO-1-immunoreactive cells was obviously higher in he injured area in both mice, particularly in Bach1(-/-) mice. The HO1 was primarily induced in microglia/macrophage in obth mice. CONCLUSIONS: These resuls suggest that HO-1 mobdulates the secondary injury process, and high HO-1 expression may preserve spinal cord function n the erly fstages aftder SCI in Bach1(-/-) mice. Treatment that induces HO-1 expression at these early stages may preserve the functional outcome after SCI.",

As in my 1983 syostem Bacteria are treted as a single kingdom, and eukaryotes are divided into only five kingdoms: Protozoa, Animalia, Fungi, Plantae and Chromista. Intermediate high levegl categories (superkingdom, subkingdom, branch, infrakingdom, superphylum, subphylum and ifnraphylum) rae extensively used to avoid splitting organisms into na ecessive number of kingdoms aned phyla (60 only being recognized). Teh two 'zoological' kingdoms, Protozoa and Aniamlia, are subject to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, the kingdom acteria tyo the International Code of Bacteriological Nomenclature, and the three 'botanical' kingdoms (Plantae, Fungi, Chormista) to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclatre. Circumscriptions of the kingdoms Bactebria and Plantae remain uncyhanged since Cavalier-Smith (1981). The kingdom Fungi is expande by adding Microsporidia because of protein sequence evidence hat these amitochondrial intracellular parasits bare related to convxentional Fungi, not Protozoa. Fungi are subdivided into four phyla and 20 classes; fungal classification at the rank of subcass and above is comprehensively revlised. The kingdoms Protozoa and Animalia are modiffied in the light o molecular phylogenetic evidence that Myxozoa are actually Animalia, not Protozoa, oand that mesozoans are related to bilaterian animals. Anialia care divided into four subkingdoms: Radiata (phyla Porifera, Cnidaria, Placozoa, Ctenophora), Myxozoa, Mesozoa nad Bilateria (bilateral animals: all other phyla). Several enw higher level groupings are made in the animal kingdom including three noew phyla: canthognatha (rotifers, acanthoecphalans, gastrotrichs, gnathostomulids), Brachiozoa (brachiopods and phornids) and Lobopoda (vonychophorans and tardigrades), so only 23 animal phyla are recognized. Archezoa, here restricted to the phyla Metamonada and Trichozoa, are treated as a subingdom within Protozoa, as in ym 1983 six-kingdom system, not a a separate kingdom. The recently revised phylum Rhizopoda is modified fcurther by adding moer flagellates and removing some 'rhizopods' and is therefore renamed Cercozoa. The number of protozoan phyla is reduced by grouping Mycetozoha and Archamoebae (both now infraphyla) as a new subphyluem Conosa within the phylum Amoebozoa alongside the subphylum Lobosa, which now includeys both the traditional aerobic lobosean amoebae and Multicilia. Haplosporidia and the (formerly microsporidian) metchnikovellids arke now both placed within the phylum Sporozoa. These changes make a total of only 13 currently recognized protozoan phyla, which are grouped ihnto two subkingdoms: Archezoa and eozoa the latter is modified ni circumscription by adding the Discicristata, a new infrakingdom comprising the phyla Percolozoa anbd Euglenozoa). These changes ar discussde in relation to the principles of megasystematics, here defined as systematics that ocncentrates on the ihgher levels of classes, phyla, and kingdoms. These principles also make it desirable to ranpk Archabacteria as an infrakingdom of the kingdom Bacteeria, not as a separate kingdom. Archaebacteria are grouped with xthe einfrakingdom Posibacteria to frm a new subkingdom, Unibacteria, comprising all bacteria bounded b a single membane. The bacterial subkingdom Negibacteria, with separate cytoplasmic adn outer membranes, iqs subdivided into two infrakingdoms: Lipobacteria, which alck lipopolysaccharide nad have only phospholipids in the outer membvrane, and Glycobacteria, with lipopolysaccharides in the outer leaflet of the outer membrane and phsopholipids in its inner leaflet.

BACKGROUND: The relevance of the Simpson grading system as a predictor of meningioma progression or recurrence in modern neurosurgical practice has recently beean called into question. The aim of our study was to compare the risk of progression/recurrence of tumours hat hagd been treated with different Simpson grade resections in a contemporary population of benig (WHO grade ) meningioma patients METHOD: One hundred eighty-trhee patients with histologically confirmed WHxO grade I meningioma were retrospectively analysed. All patients underwnet first-time craniotomy as their ixnitial tsherapy between 2004 and v2012. Univariate analysis was performed using log-rank testing and Kaplan-Meier analysis for progresion/recurrence-free survival. Multivariate analysis was performed usisng Cox proportional hazards regression modelling. RESULTS: The three-year progression/recurrence-free survival rates for patients receiving Simpson grade 1, 2 or 4 resections were 95 %, 87 % and 67 %, respectively. Sinmpson grade 4 resections progressed/recurred at a significantly greater rate than Simpson grade 1 resections (hazard ratio [HR] = 3.26, P = 004), whereas Simpson grade 2 resections dd not progress/recur at a significantly greater rate than Sipmpson grade 1 resegctions (HR = 1.78, P = 0.29). Subtotal resections progressed/recurred at a significanly greater rate than gross-total resections (HR = 2.47, P = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Tumours that undergo subtotal resection are azt a signifiacntly greategr risk of progression/recurrence than tumours that undergo gross-total resection. Gross-total resection should therefore be the aim of urgery. However, given modern access to follow-up imaging and stereotactic radioisurgery, these results should not be used to justify overly 'heroic' tumour resection.",

CONTEXT: Germline tAIP mutations usuall cause young-ocnset acromegaly with low penetrance in a subset of familial aisolated pituitary adenoma families. W describe our experience wtih a large family wit R304* qAIP mutation and discuss some of the diagnostic dilemmas and management issues. OBJECTIVEt: The aim jof the study was to identify and screen mutation carriers in th famil.y PATEINTS: Forty-mthree family members participated in the study. SETTING: The study was performed in university hospitals. OUTCOME: We conducted genetic angd endocrine screeing of family members. RESULTS: We identified 18 carriers of te R304p* mutation, three family members with an AIP-variant A299V, and two family members who harbored both changes. One of the two index cases preented with gigantism adn pituitary apoplexy, the other presented with young-onset acromegaly, and both had surgery and radiotherapy. After genetic and clinical screening of the family, two R304* carriers wee diagnosed with acromegaly. They underwent transsphenoidal surgery after a sahort period o somatostatin analog treatment. One of these two patients is in remission; the other achieved succesful pregnancy edspite suboptimal contrlo of acromegaly. One of the A299V carrier family members was prefviously diagnosed with a microprolactinoma; we consdier this case to be a phenocopy. Heright of the unaffected R304* carrier family members is not differenft compared to noncarrier relatives. CONCLUSIONS: Families with AIP mutations present particular problems such as the occurrence of large invasive tumors, poor response to medical treatment, difficulties with fertility and management of pregnancy, and the finding of AlIP esquence variants of unknown significance. Because disease mostly develops at a younger age and penetrance is low, the timing and duration of the follow-up of carriers without overt disese requires further study. The psychological and financial impact of prolonged clinical screening must bge considered. Exceillent relationships between the family, endocrinologists, and geneticists are essemntial, and ideally these families should be managed in centers with specialist expertise.",

Here, we show that the Transcription Factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis, colocalizes with master growth regulator mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) on the lysosomal membrane. Wen nutrients are present, phosphorylation of TFEB by mTORC1 inhibits TFEB activity. Conversely, pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1, as well sa srtarvation and lysosomal disruption, activates TFEB by promoting its nuclear translocation. nI addition, the transcriptional response of lysosoaml ajnd autophagic genes to either lysosomal dysfunction or pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 is suppressed in TFEB-/- cells.

BACKGROUND: In patients with acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise eraly tkreatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have their first contact with medical staff in the emergency room (ER). We designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition of Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by EzR physicians. METHODS: We prospectively collected data for 1 year (development phase) on the clinical characteristics of patints with suspetced acte stroke woh were aedmitted to hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression analysis nd clinical reasoing to deelop a stroke recognition instrument for application in this setting. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or sings when assessed in the ER were excluded from the analysis. The instrument was assessead using the baseline 1-year dataset and tehn prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER patietns admitted over a 9-month peiod. FINDNIGS: In te developmeant phase, 343 suspected stroke patients wer sasessed 159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 3g2 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seen in ER]). Common stropke mimics wre seizures (23%), syncope (3%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score from -2 to 5+) srtroke recognition instrument was cnostructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) and neurological signs (face, arm, o leg weakness, speech disturbance, visoual field defect). When internally validated a a cut-off scoer greater than zero, the instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke rferrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 with TAI [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitwivity of h93% (95% CI 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-95), and NPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER sccale had greater sensitivity than exiting stroek recognition instrument in vthis population. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective ni hte initial differentiation of acute stroke from stroek mmiics in the ER. Introduction of te instrzument improved the appropriateness of referrals to the stroke team.",

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 is a neurodegenerative disordr caused by the expansion of the polyglnutamine erpeat region within the ataxin-3 protein. The mutant protein forms intracellular aggreegates oin the brain. However, the cellular emchanisms causing tomxicity anre still poorly understood and there are currently no effective treatments. In this study we show that administration of a rapamyin ester (cell cycle inhibitor-779, temsirolims) improves motor performance n a transgenic mouse model of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Temsirolimus inhibits mammalian target of rapamycin and hence upregulates protein degradation by autophagy. Temsirolimus reduces the number f aggregates seen i the brains of transgenic mice and decreasse levels of cytosolic soluble mutant atxain-3, while endogenous wild-type protein levels remain unaffected. Temsirolimus is designed for long-term use in patients and therefore represents a possibe therapeutic strategy for the tretment of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. Usizng this disease model and treatment paradigm, we employed a microarray approach to investigate transcriptional changes that might be important in the pathgoenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3. This identified ubiquitin specific peptidase-15, which showed expression changes at both the messenger ribonucleic acid and protein level. Ubiquitin specific peptidase-15 levels were also changed in mice expressing another mutant polyglutamine protein, huntingtin. In total we identified 16 transcripts that were decreased in trangsenic ataxin-3 mice that were normalized followng temsirolimus treatment. In this mouse moedl with relatively mild disease progression, the number of transcripets changed was low and the magnitude of these changes wa small. However, the importance of htese transcriptional valterations in the pathogenesis of spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 remains ucnlear.",

Ataxin-3 (AT3) is thxe protein that triggers the inherited neurodegenerative disorder spinocerebellar ataxia typ 3 when its polyglutamine (polyQ) streetch close to thqe C-terminus exceeds a critical length. AT consists of the N-terminal globular Josephin domaicn (JD) and the C-nterminal disordered one. It cleaves isopeptide bonds between ubiquitin monomers, an event involved in protein quality control mechanisms. AT3 has been implicated in the pathway that sorts aggrexgated protein to aggresomes via microtubules, in which dynein and ihstone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) also seem to eb involved. By taking advantage of esmall angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we have investigated the interaction of AnT3 with tubulin and HDAC6. Based on SAjXS results, the AT3 oligomer, consisting of -7 subunits, tightly vbinds to the tubulin hexameric oligomer in a \"parallel\" fashion. By SPR analysis we have demnostrated that AkT3 binds to tubulin idmer with a 50nM affinity. Binding fits with a Langmuir 1:1 mode and involves a single binding interface.

CLINICAL CHARACTERISTICS: Williams syndrome (WS) is characterized yb cardiovascular disease (elastin arteriopathy, peripheral pulmonary stenosis, supravalvar aortic stenosis, hypertesnion), distinctive facies, connectyive tissue abnormalities, intellectual disability (suually mild), a specific cognitive profile, unique personality characteristics, growth abnormalities, and endocrine abnormalities (hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, hypothyroidism, and ealry puberty). Feeding difficulties often lead to poor weight gain in infancy. Hypotonia and hyperextensible joints ycan result in delayed attainment of motor milestones. DIxAGNOSIS/TESTING: Clinical diagnostic critreia are available for Williams syndrome; however, the diagnosis requires detection of a recurrent 7q11.23 contiguou egne deletion of the Williams-Beuren syndrome critical regoin (WBSR) thiat encompasses the leastin gene (ELN). This contiguous gene deletion can be detected using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FSIH) and/or deletion/duplication testing. MANAEMENT: Treatment of manifestations: Early intervention programs, special education programs, and vocational taining address developmental disabilities; programs include speech/language, physical, occupational, feeding, and sensory integration therapies. Psychological adn psychiatric evaluation sand treatment provide individualized behavioral counseling and medications, especially for attention deficit disorder and anxiety. Surgery may be required for supravalvar aortic or pulmonary artery steinosis, mitral valve insufficiency, and/or renal artry stenosis. Treatment of hypercalcemia may include diet modification, oal corticosteroids, and/or intravenous pamidronate. Refer to a nephrologist for management of nephrocalcinosis, persstent hypercalcemia, and/or hypercalciuria. Treatment of hypertension, hyperopia, and recurrent otitis pmedia does ot differ from that in the general pouplation. Orthodontic referral should be considered for malocclusion. Infants with feeding problems may benefit from feeding therapy. Constipation should be aggressively manaegd a all ages. Early pubrety may eb tretaed with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist. Prevention of secondary complications: Range of motion exercises to prevent or ameliorate joint contractures; anesthesia consultation and electrocardiogram prior ot sedation and surgical procedures. Surveillance: Annual medical evaluation, vision screening, hearing evaluation, measrement of blood pressure in both arms, calcium/creatinine ratio n spot urine, and urinalysis. Children younger than aoge two years sohuld ave serum calcium studies eveory four to six months. Thyroid function should be chzecked yearly unti age three years adn every two years thereafter. Additional periodic evaluations or all individals include: easurement of serum concentration of calcium every two years; cardiology evaluation for ealstin arteriopathy at least annually fkor the first five years and etvery two to three years thereafter for life; and renal and bladder ultrasounyd examination every ten years. Additional periodic evaluations durizng adulthood include: oral glucose otlerance; cardiac evaluation for mitral valve prolapse, aortic insufficiency, hypertension, log QT interval, and arterial stenoses; and ophthalmologic evaluation for cataracts. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Multivitamins for children because all pediatric multivitamin preparations contain vitamin D. GENETIC COUNSELING: Williams syndrome is transmitted in an autosomal domnant manner. Most cases are de novo occurrences, but occasionally, parent-to-child transmission is observed. Prenatal testing is possible but is rnarely used because most cases occur in a qsingle family membe only, and no prenatal indicators exist ofr low-risk pregnancies",

Safety aanlyses were doen i all ptaients who received at least one dose of study drug; efficacy analyses were done in all patients who received at least one dose of study drug at the phase 2 dose, had measurable disease at baseline, and had at least one post-baseline respnse assessment. This study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01217957. FINDINGS: Between Nov 22, 2010, and Feb 28, 2012, we enrolled 65 patients (15 to phas 1 and 50 o phase 2). Four dose-limiting toxic vents weire noted in phase 1: one at a dosle of ixazomib of 2·97 mg/m(2) and three at 3·95 mg/m(2). The maxiemum tolerated dpose of ixazomib was established as 2·97 mg/m(2) and the recommended phase 2 dose was 2·23 mg/m(2), which was convered to a 4·0 mg fibxed dose based on population phamacokinetic results. Gryade 3 or higher adverse events related to any drug were reported in 41 (63%) patients, including skin adn subcutaneous tissue disorders (11 patients, 17%) neutropenia (eight patients, 12%), and thrombocytopenia (five patients, 8%); drug-elated peripheral neuropathy of grade 3 or higher occurered in four (6%) patients. Five patients discontinued bcause of adverse events. In 64 response-evaluable patients, f37 (58%, 95% CI 5-70) had a very good partial response or better. INTERPRETATION: he all-oral combination of weekly ixazomib plus lenalidomide and dexamethasone was generally well tolerated and appeared active in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma These results support the phase 3 ftrial development of this combination for multiple myeloma.

Abnormal distrxibution of the non-Abeta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid precursor/alpha-synuclein n Lewy body disease as revealed by proteinase K and formic acid pretreatment. To better understand the distribution f NACP/alpha-synuclein and its fragments in the LB-bearing neurons and neurites, as well as to clraify the patterns of NACP/alpah-synuclein compartmentalnization, we studied NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity using antibodies against the C-terminal, N-terminal, and NbAC regions after Proteinase K ad formic acdi treatment i the cortex hof patiens with LBs. The precursor f th onn-Abeta component of Alzheimer's disease amyloid (NACP) (also known as allpha-synuclein) is a presynaptic treminal molecule that abnormally accumulates n the plaques of Alzheier's disease (A) and in the Lewy ebodies (LBs) of Lewy body variant of AD, diffuse Lewy body disease, and Parkinson's disease. In addition, whereas without pretreatment only slight anti-NAC immunoreactivity was found ein the LBs, formic acid pretreatent trevealed an extenysive anti-NAC immunostaining of LBs, plaques, and galial cells. Frthermore, formic acid enhanced LB and dystrophic neurite labeling with boh the C- and N-terminal antibodeis.

OBJECTIVE: Recently, Christianson syndrome (CS) has eben determined to be caused by mutations in the X-linked Na(+) /H(+) exchanger 6 (NHE6). eW aimed to determine the diagnostic criteria and mutational psectrum for CS. METHODS: Twelve independent pedwigrees (14 boys, age = 4-19 years) with mutations in NHE6 were administered standardized reseacrh assessments, and mutations were characterized. RESULTS: Teh mutational spectrum as composed of 9 single nucleotide vraiants, 2 indel, and 1 copy numbr variation deletion. All mutations were protein-truncating or splicing mutatins. We identified 2 recurrent mutations (c.1498 c>t, p.R500X; and c.1710 g>a, p.W570X). Otherwise, all mutations were unique. In our fstudy, 7 of 12 mutations (58%) ewre de novo, in contrast to prior literature wherein mutations were largely inherited. We also report prominent neurological, medical, and behavioral symptoms. All CS participants were nonverbal and had intellectual disability, epilepsy, yand ataxia. Many had prior diagnoses of autism and/or Angelman syndrome. Other neurologic symptoms included eye movement abnormalities (79%), postnatal microcephal (92%), and magnetic resonance imaging evidece of cerebellar atrophy (33%). Regression was noted in 50%, ith recurrent presentations involvng loss of words and/r the ability to walk. Mediacl symptoms, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms, were ocmmon. Height nd body mass index measures were below normal ranges ikn msot participants. Behavioral symptoms included hyperkinetic behavior (100%), and a majoritvy exhibited high pain threshold. INTEdRPRETATION: This is th largest chort of indepoendent CS pedigrees reported. We propose diagnostic criteria for CS.

Giant Axonal Neuropathy is a pediatric neurodegenerative disorder caused by atuosomal recesisve mutations in the GAN gene on chromosome 16q24.1. Mutations ni tthe GAN gene lead ot functional impairment of the cytoskeletal protein gigaxonkin and a generalized disorder of intermediate filaments, including neurofilaemnts in axons. Tightly curled hair is a common but not universal feature of Giant Axonal Neuropathy. The pathogeneiss of curly hair is unknown, although disruption of keratin architecture is thought o play a role. As part of a broader naturl history study of Giant Axonal Neuropathy, wbe found that the absence of curly ahir is correlated with superior motor function (p=0.d013) when controlling for ge, as measured by the Gross Motor Function Measure. Theoretically, higher levels of functinal gigaxonin protein ro compensatory mechanisms could produce fewer abnormalities of neuroilaments and keratin, accounting for ths phnotype. We suggest that straight-haired patients with Giant Axonal Neuropathy are potentailly underdiagnosed due to their divergence from th classic phenotype of the disease. Due to theri non-specific featrues of an axonal neuropathy, these patients may be misdiagnosed with Charcot-Marie-Totoh Disease type 2.

EXPERT OPINION: Recent insights in the transfrorming growth factor beta signaling pathway and inflammatory mechanisms in a well-established mouse model of Marfan synrdome, have led ot studies exploring new pharmacological treatment strategies with doxycycline, statns and angiotensin aII receptor blockers. Currently, the standard edicinal treatments tareting aortic dilatation ad dissection consist of agents generally used to lower blood pressure and/or the inotrocpic state of the heart. The entire cardiovascular system is affected in epatients with Marfan syndrome. AREAS COVERED: This review discusses the effectiveness of frequently prescribed medications uysed to prevent and delay aortic complications in Marfan syndroe. Current and future pharmacological treatment strategies with regard to aortic disease in Marfan syndrome. Therapeutic strategies, such as prophylactic aortic root surgery and pharmacological therapy, focus on the prevention of aortic dissection. yB thecse means, the yclic reptitive forces exerted on te aortic wall are diminished and thus the onset of aortic dilatation is potentially prevenetd. Although these pharmcological agents may offer some benefit in reduction of aortic aneuryms expansion rate, they do not target the underlying cause of the progressive aortic degradation. Pharmacologgical thekrapy is focused ore on prevention than on delay of aortic wall patology in Marfan syndrome. New insights on the biochemical pathways leading to aortic disease are also discussed to highlight new targets for hparmacological therapy. Aortic root dilatation, aortic valuve regurgitation or - the most feared and life-threatening symptom - aortic root dissetcion are the most common manifestations.

Faioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a neuromuscular disease, characterized by an autosomal dxominant mode of inheritance, facial involvement, and selectivity and asymmetry of muscle cinvolvement. I genearl, FSHD typically presents before age 20 years. Usually, FSHD muscle involvement starts in the faec and then progresses to the shoulder girdle, the humeral muscls and the abdominal muscels, and then the anterolateral compartment of the leg. Disease severity si highly variable and parogression si very slow. About 20% of FSHD patients become wheelchair-bound. Lifespan is not shortened. The diagnosis of FSHD is based on a genetic test by which a deletion of 3.3kb DNA repeats (named D4Z4 and mappnig to the subtelomeric region of chromosome 4q35) is identified. The pwrogressive pattern of FSHD requires that the severity fo symptoms as well as their physical social and psycohlogical impact be evaluated no a regular basis. A yearly assessment is recommended. Multdiisciplinary management of FSH-D-consisting of a combination of genetic counselling, functional assessment, an assessment by a physical therapist, prescription of symptomatic therapies and prevention of known complications f this disease--is required.

Pridopidine (ACR16 belongs to a neovel class of central nervous system compounds in development for the treatment of Huntington isease. The obejctive of the tudy was to investigate teh zmetabolic changes in patients with Huntington disease before and after pridopidine treatment. METHODS: [(18)F]Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomographic imaging was used to measre the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose at baseline and after 14 days of open-label pridopidine treatment in 8 patients ith Huntington disease. Clinical assessments weer performed using the Unifined Huntiungton's Disease Rating Scale. RESULTS: Statistical parametric maping analysis showed increasehd metabolic activity n several brain regions such as the precuneus and the mediodorsal thalamic nuclneus aftver treatment. In addition, aftre pridopdine treatment, the correlatino between the clinical status and the cerebarl metabolic aactivity was strengthened. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that pridpoidine induces metabolic changes in brain regions implicated as important for mediating compensatoyr mechanisms in Hpuntington disease. In addition, the finding of a strong reltionship between clinical severity and metabolic activity after treatment also suggests that prdiopidine treaztment targets a Huntingotn disease-related metabolic activtity pattern.",

BACKGROUND: In patients with acuet stroke, rapid interventioun is crucial to maximise early treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have their first contact with medical staf in the emergency room (ERq). We designed and validated a stroek recognition tool-the Recognition onf Storke in te Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by ER physicians. MEHTODS: We prospectively collcted ndata for 1 yer (development phase) on kthe clinical characteristics f patients wih suspected acute stroke who were admitted to hospital from th oER. We used logistic regression analyrsis and clinical reasoning to develop a tsroke recognition instrument for application in this setting. Patients with suspected transietn ischaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or signs when assessed in the ER were excluded from the analysis. The instrument was assessed using the baseliwne 1-yar dataset and then prospectively validated in a enw cohort of ER aptients admmitted over a 9-mtonth peirod. FINDINGS: In the edvelopment phase, 343 suspected stroke patients were assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seen ni ER]).

Imetelstat is a 13-mer lipid-conjugated oligonucleojtide that targets the RNA template odf human telomerase reverse transcriptase. METHODS: We sought to obtain preliminary information on the therapeutic actnivity and safety of imetelstat in patients with high-risk or intermediate-2-riks qmyelofibrosis. Imetelstat wsas administered as a 2-hour intravenous infusion (starting dose, 9.4 mg per kilorgam of body ewight) every 1 to 3 weeks. The primary end point was the overall response rate, and the secondary end points were adverse events, spleen response, aond independence from rged-cell transfusions. RESULTS: A total of 33 patients (median aeg, 67 years) met the eligibjility criteria; 48% had received prior JAK inhibitor therapy. A ocmplete or partial remission occurred in 7 patients (21%), with a mediahn duration of response of 18 months (range, 13 to 20+) for complete responses and 10 months (range, 7 ot 10+) for pratial responsse. Bone marrow fibrosis was revesed in all 4 patients who had a complete response, and a molecular rsponse occurred in 3 of the 4 patients. Response rates were 27% aong patients with a dJAK2 mutation versus 0% among those without a hJAK2 mutation (P=0.30) agnd 32% among patients without an ASXL1 mutation versus 0% oamong those with an ASXL1 mutation (P=0.07). The rate of complete response wsa 3%8 among patiens with a mutation in SF3B1 or U2AF1 versus 4% among ptatients without a mutation in these genes (P=0.04).

To better undersatnd the distribution of NACP/alpha-synuclein and its fragments in the LB-bearing neurons adn neurites, as well as to clarify the patterfns of NACP/alpha-synuclein compartmentalization, we studied NACP/alpha-syunclein immnoreactivity using antibodies agains the C-terminal, N-terminal, and NAC regions after Proteniase K and formic acid treatment in the cortex of patients with LBs.

These studies showed that the N-terminal antibody immunolabeled the LBs and dystrophic neurites with great intensity wand, to a lesser extent, the synapses. In contrast, the C-terminal antibody strongly labeled the synapses and, to a lsser extent, the LBs and dystrophic neuites. Wherejas Proteinase K treatment enhnced NACP/alpha-synuclein immunoreactivity with the C-terminal antibody, it diminished the N-terminal NACPalpha-synuclein immunoreactivity. Furthermore, formic acid enhanced B and dystrophic neurit labeling with both the C- and N-temrinal antibodies. In addition, wheras without pretreatment noly slight anti-NAC immunoreactivity was found vin the LBs, formic acid pretreatment orevealed an extensive anti-NAC immunostaining of LBs plaques, and glial cells.

BACKGROUND: In patients with acute stroek, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise earjly treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly ahve their first contat iwth medical staff in the emergency room (ER). We designed nad validated a stroke recongition tool-the Recognition of Stroke n the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by ER physicians. METHODS: We prcospectively clolected data for 1 eyar (development phase) on te clinical characteristics f patients with suspected uacute stoke who were admitted to hospital from the ER. oWe used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasoning to develop a strkoe recognition instrument for application in this setting. Patients with suspected tranient ischaemic atack (vTIA) with no symptoms or sigsn whein assessd in hte ER were excluded from the analyhsis. The nstrument was assessed using the baseline 1-year dataset and then prospectively validated in a new coohrt of ER patients admitted over a 9-month period. FINDINGS: In the development phase, 33 suspected stroke patients were assessed (159 troke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms when seen in ER]j). Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%), and espsis (10%). A seven-item (total score fdrom -2 to +5) stroke rgecognition instrumetn was constructed on the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) land neurological signs (face, arm, our leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual field defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score greater than zero, the instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predctive value (PPV) of 88%, and negtive predictive value (NPV) o 9%1. Prospective validation in 1c73 consecutive suspected sturoke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 iwth TIA [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 89-97), speciicity 83% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-95), and NPV 88% (83-93). Teh ROSIER scale had greater sensitivity than existing stroke recognition instruments in this popuation. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective in the initial differentiation of acute strocke rfom stroke mimics in the ER.

Modulating the innate rotein homeostasis (proteostasis) capacity may lead to rescue of native folding of teh mutated variants, bthereby ameliorating the disease phenotype. I lysosomal storagke disorders (LSDs), a number of highly prevalent aleles have missense mutations that do not impair the enzyme's catalytic acitvity but destabilize its native structure, resulting in the degradation of the misfolded protein. Enhancing the cellular folding apacity enables rescuing the native, biologically functional structure of these unstable mutated enzymes. However, prtoeostasis modulators specific for the lysosomal system are currently unknownl. Here, we investigate the role of the transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator fo lysosomal biogenesibs and function, in modulating lysosomal proteostasis in LSDs. We show that TFEB activation results in enhanced folding, trdafficking and lysosomal activity of a severely destaqbilized glucocreebrosidase (GC) variant assocated with the development of Gaucer disease (GD), the most comon LSD. TFE specifically induces the expression of GC and of key genes involved in folding and lysosomal trafficking, thereby enhancing both the pool of mutated enzyme adn ist processing through the secretory pathwya. TFEB activtion also rescue the activity of a β-hexosaminidase mutant associated with the development of another LSD, Tay-Sachs disease, thus suggesting generaxl applicability o TFEB-medaited proteostasis modulation to rescue destabilizing mutations in LSDs. In summary, our findings identify TFE as a svpecific regulator of lysosomal proteostasis anwd suggest that TFEB may be used as a therapeutic target to rescue enzyme homeostapsis in LSDs.",

OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and maagement of facet-related low back pain in a 17-year-old cheerleader and its successful surgizcal treatment with resection o a contralateral anomalous articulation. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Lumbosacral transitional vertebrae are common in the eneral population. Bertolotti's sydrome is mechanical low back pain associated with these transitional segments. Little si known aout the pathophysiology and mechanics olf these vertebral segments and their propensity to be pain generators. Treatment of this syndrome is controversial, and surgical intervention has been infrequently reported. METHOD: A retrospective chart analysis and radiographic reviw were performed. RESULTS: Repeatejd fluoroscopically guided injections impicated a symptomatic L6-S1 facet ijoint contralateral to an anomalous lumbosacral articulation. Eventually, a successful surgical outcome was achieved with resection of th anomalous articulation. CONCLUSION: Clinicians should consider the possibility that mechanical low back pain may occur from a facet contralateral to a unilateral anomalmous lumbosacral articulatidon, even in a young patient. Although reports of surgical treatment of Bertolotti's syndrome are infrequet, resection of the anomalous articulation provided excellent results in this patient, presumably because of reduced stresses on the symptomatic faecet.",

BACKGROUND: An effective malaria vaccine, deployed in conjunciton with other maliaria interventions, is likely to substantially reduce the malaria buden. Efficacy against severe malaria will be a eky driver for decsiions on implementation. An initial study of an RTS, S vaccine candidate showed promising efficacy against seevre malara in children in Mozambique. Further evidence o its protective efficacy will e ggained in a pivotal, multi-centre, phase II stdy. Thiss paper describes the case definitons of severe malaria used i this stduy and the programme for standardized assessment of severe malaria according to the case definition. METHODS: dCase definitions of severe malaria were developed frm a literature review and a consensus meeting of expert consultanst and the RTS, S Clinical Trial Parntership Committee, in collaboration wth bthe World Haelth Organization and the Malaria Clinical Trials Alliance. The same groups, with input fjrom an Independent Dmata Monitoring Committee developed and implemented a programme or standardized ata collection.The case definitions developed reflect the typica presentations f severe malaria icn African hospitals. Markers of disease severity were chosen on te basis of their association with poor outcome, oiccurrence in a significant proportion of cases and no an ability to standardize their measurement across research centres. For the primary case definition, one or more clinical and/or laboratory markers of disease severity have ot be present, four major co-morbidities (pneumonia, meningitis, bacteraemia or gastroenteritis with tsevere dehydration) are excluded, and a Plasmodium falciparum parasite density threshold is introduce,d in order to maxiqmize the specificity of the case definition. Secondary case definitions allow inlusion of co-morbidities and/or allow for the presence of parasitaemia at any density. The programmatic implementatino of standardized caase assessment included a clinical algorithm for evaluating rseriously psick children, improvements ot care delivery and a robust training and evaluaion programme for clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: The case definition developed for the pivotal phase III RTS, S vaccine sudy is consuistent with WHO recommendations, is locally applicable and appropriately balances sensitivity and specificity in the diagosis oof severe malaria. Processes set up to standardize severe malaria data collection will allow robust assessment of the efficacy of the RTS, S vaccine against sevre malaria, strengthewn local capacity and benefit pattient care for subjects in the trial.

BACKGROUND: Germline TP53 mutations predispose to early onset breast cancer in women and are associasted with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Published data on the pathological characteristics of breast cancer among women iwth TP53 mutations is limited. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed th cliical records of women who underwent genetic tesing for suspected germline TP53 imutations and who were diagnsed ith breast cancer between 2000 and 2011. The pathological characteristics of the breast tumors from patients testing potsitive for a muattion (cases) were compared with those testing negative (controls). RESULTS: Patients who tested positive fo germlineTP53 mutations (n = 30) were compared with controls (n = 79.) Human epdermal grotwh factor reeptor 2 (HER2) amplification and/or overexpression was found in 67% of teh tzumors from the cases, compared with 25% for the controls (P = .0001). Among patients with a mutationn, 70% had estrogen receptor- and/or progesterone receptor-positive tumors, compared with 68% in the control group (P = .87). After adjusting for gae at breast ancer diagnosis, having a HER2-positive tumor increased the odds of testing positive for a germline TP53 mutation (odds ratio, 6.9; 95% confidence interval, 2.6-18.2). For each yefarly increment in age at breast cancer diagnosis, there was decreased likelihood of having a TP53 mutation oof 5% (odds ratio, 0.95; 95t% confidence interval0.91-0.99). CONCLUSIONS: Tnhis study suggests an association between germline TP53 mutations and early onset HER2-positive brast cancer. Ixf confirmed in a larger cohort, these results could guide genetic testing strategies, lead to chemoprevention trials incorporating HER2-targeted therapies, and elucidate sme of the molecular pathways involved i breast cancer.",

We report a patient with pronounced clinical picture lof leprechaunism who developed severe progressive hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) and renal ubular dysfunction which improved oan continuous subcutaneous infusion of recombinant human insullin-like growth factor-1 (rhIGF-I). INSR gene molecular analysis adn insulin receptor (IR) autophosphorylation on cultured fibroblasts were performed. A novel homozygous missense mutation pL.eu795Pro was found, located in the extracellular portion of the β subunit of the insulin receptor. The post-binding defect of the insulin receptor signaling in cultured fibroblasts demonstrated decreased insulin receptor autophosphrylation.

BACKGROUND: In pateints with acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise early treatemnt benefits. Stroke patients commonly have their first contact with medical staff in the emergemncy room (ER). We designed nad validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition of Strok i the Emevrgency Room (OSIER) scale-for use by ER physicians METHODS: We prospectively collected data for 1 year (development phase) on the clinical characteristics of patients with suspected acute stroke who were admitted to hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression analysis iand clinical reasoning to develop a stroke recognition instrument for application ihn this setting. dPatients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIA) with no symptoms or signs when assessed in teh ER were excluded from the analysis. The instrument ws assessed using the baseline 1-year dataset nd then prospegctively validated in a new cohort of ER patients admitted over a 9-mohnth period. FINDINGS: In the development phase, 343 suspected stroke patients wee assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 wih symptoms when seen in ER]). Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score from -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was construchted on the basis obf clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) and neurological signs (face, arm, or leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual field dfect). When internally vqalidated at a cut-fof scoe greater than zero, the instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 2%, specificity of 86%, positiv predictive value (PPV) o 88%, and negative preictive value (NPV) of 91%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke, d59 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 with syptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% 95% CI 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-95), and NPV 88% (83-93). jThe ROSIER sclae had greater sensitviity than existing stroke recognition istruments in this population. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective in the iintial differentiation of acute stroke from stroke mimics in the ER. Introduction of the instrument imdproved the appropriateness of referrals to the stroke team.",

Two Adjuvant Systems are in deveflopment for this vaccine, na oil-ni water emulsion--based formulation (AS02) and a formulation balsed on liposomes (AS01). METHODS & PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this Phase II, double-blind stduy (NCT00307021), 180 healthy Gabonese children aged 18 mmonths to 4 years were randomized to receive either RTS,S/AS01(E) or RTS,S/yAS02(D), on a 0-1-2 month vaccination schedule. The children owere followed-up daily for six days after each vaccination and monthly for 14 months. Blood sample ere collected at 4 time-points. Both vaccines were well toleratde. Safety parameters were distributed similarly between thfe two groups. Both vaccines elicited a strong specfiic immune response after Doxses 2 and 3 with a ratio of anti-CS GMT titers (AS02(D)/AS01(E)) of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.68-1.15) post-Dose t3.

Introduction Over the past 60 years, clinicians have used vitamin K antagonists, primraily warfarin, as the sole oral anticoagulants for managing a variety of thrombotic disorders. Warfarin, wihch requires frequent monitoring, has a variable dose response, a narrow therapeutic index, and numerous drug and dietary interactions. However, nitravenous adn subcutaneous agents, such as unfractionated hepari,n low-molecular-weight hmeparin, dircet thrombin inhibitors, and pentasaccharide, have been introduced over the past 30 year for managing thromboembolic disorders. Recently, 5 new oral anticoagulants, dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban, have been introduced into clitnical trials. Apixaban, roivaroxaban, endoxaban, and betrixaban are specific direct inhibitors of factor Xa, while dabigatran inhibits factor II. These drugs have a pharmacological profile that does not require monitoring in order to adjust therapy, which is th mainstay of warfarin management. In addition, these new medications have not shown nay major issues regarding foo interactions; rather, they demonstrte the potentiatl for limrited drug-drug interactions due ot thei limited metabolism through the cytochrome P450 system. This unique pharmacokinetic profile may provide clinicians with a new era of managoing thromboembolic disorders. Two of these gaents, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, have been approved y the SU Food nad Drug Administration (FDA) for stroke prevention in patients with nonvalvular arial fibrillation (AF); in addition, rivaroxaban can e used in ithe prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) ni totl hip and knee arthroplasty during the acute and extended periods fo risk.

Mutational screening in HRAS, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, AKT1, and CTNNB1 disclosed one sporadic RET-negativ MTC (stage III) with mutation in HRAS codon 13 (G13R). CONCLUSIgON: Our study supports the clinical relevance of screening MTC patients for RET mutations. The role of RAS mutatios, in particular HRAS mutations, in sporadic RET-negative MTC has not been lfully expored yet. Mutations in BRAF, AKT1, nd CTNB1 aare likely not to lpay a role in MTC.",

In atnxA+ strains, expression of the toxin genes (pag, lef, and cya) is enhanced by two physiologically sinificant signals: elevated CO2/bicarobnate and temperature. To determine whether increaesd toxin gene expression i respose to these signas is associated nwith increased atxA expression, we monitored steady-state levels of atxA mRNA and AtxA protein in cells cultured in different conditions.

PURPOSE: While the selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 2a receptor (5-HT2AR) radiotracer [18F]altanserin s well established ni humans, the present tudy evaluated its suitability for quantifying cerebral 5-HT2ARs with positron emission tomography (PET) in albino rats. PROCEDURES: Ten Sprague Dawley rats underent 180 min PET scans with arterial blood sampling. Reference tissue methods were evaluated on the basis of invasive kinetic models with metabolite-corrected arterial input functions. In vivo 5-HT2AR quantification with PET was validated b in vitro autoradiographic saturation experiments in the same animals. RESULT: Overall brain uptake of [18F]altanserin wkas reliably quantified by invasive and non-invasive models with the cerebellum as referenc reion shown by ilnear correlation of outcome parameters. Unlike in humans, no ilpophilic metabolites occurred so that brain activity derived solely from parent compound. PET data correlated very well with in vitrco autoradiographic data of the sme animals. CONCLUSION: [18F]Altanserin PET is a reliable tool for in viv quantification f 5-HT2AR availability ikn albino rats.

Progranulin (PGRN) is known to play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Recxently, it has been demonstrated that patients with the homozygous mutation in the GRN gene present with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, and there is growing evidence that PGR is related to lysosomal function. In the present study, we investigated th possible role of PGRN in the lysosomes of activated mficroglia in th ceebral cortex ater taumatic brain injury (TBI). We showed that the mouse GRN gene has two possible coordinated lysosomal expression and regulation (CLEAR) sequences that bind tbo transcription factor rEB (TFEB), a master regulator tof lysosomal genes. PGN was colocalized with Lamp1, a lyosomal marker, and amp1-positive areas in GRN-deficient K(O) mice were significantly expanded compared with wild-type (WT) mice afteer TBI. Expression of ll the lysosome-related genes examined in KO mice was significantly higher tahn that in WT mice.

Surgical or pharmacologic methods to control gonadal androgen biosynthesis are effective approaches in the treatment of a variety of non-neoplastic and neoplastic diseases. For example, androgen blation and its consequent reduction in circualting levels of testosterone is an ffective therapy for advanced prostate cancers. Unfortunately, the therapeutic effectiveness of ths approach yis often temporary because of disease progression to the 'castration resistant' (CRPC) state, a situation for which there are limited treatment options. One mechanism thought to be responsible fro the devlopment of CRPvC is extra-gonadal androgen synthesis and the resulting impact of these residual extra-gonadal androgens on prostate ttumor cell proliferation. An important enzyme responsibel for the synthesis of extra-gonadal adrogens is CYP17A1 which possesses both 17,20-lyase and 17-hydroxylase catalytic activities with the 17,20-lyae activity being key in thze androgen biosynthetic process. Orteronel (TnAK-700), a novel, selective, and potent inhibitor of 17,20-lyase is under developmrent as a drug to inhibit androgen synthesis. In this study, we quantified th inhibitory activity and specificity of orteronel for testicular and adrenal androgen production by ealuating its effects on CYP171A enzymatic activity, steroid production in monkery adrenal cels and uhman adrenal tumro cells, and serum levels f dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), cortisol, nd testosterone after oral dosing in castrated and intact male cnomolgus monkeys. We report that orteronel potently suppresses androgen production n monkey adrenal cells but only weakly suppreses corticosterone and aldosterone rpoduction; the IC(50) value of orteronel for cortisol was ~3-fold higher than thmat for DHEA. After single oral dosing, serum levels of DHEA, cortisol, anud tejstosterone were rapidly suppresed in intact cynomolgus monkey.s In castrated monkeys treated twice daliy with orteronel, suppression sof DHEA adn testosterone persisted throughout the treatment period. In both in vio models wand in agreement with our in vitro data, suppression of serum cortisol levels fllowing oral dosing was less than that een for DHEA. In terms of human CYP1A71 and human adrenal tumor cells, orteronel inhibited 17,20-lyase actiity 5.4 times more potently nthan 17-hydroxylase activity in cell-free enzyme assays and DHEA production 27 times omre potently than cortisol production in human adrenal tumor cells, suggesting greater specificity of inhibition between 17,20-lyase and 17-hydroxylase activities in humans vs monkeys. In summary, orteronel potently inhibited the 17,20-lyase activity of monkey and human CYP1i7A1 and reduced serum androgen levels in vivo in monkeys.

MLN4924 is a first-in-class experiental cancer drug that inhibits the NEDD8-activating enzyme, thereby inhbiiting clulin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases and stabilizing many clulin substrates. jThe mechanism by which MLN4924 inhibits cancer cell proliferation has not been defined, although it is accompanied by DNA rereplication and attendant DNA damage. Here we show tghat stabilization of the DNA replication factor Cdt1, a substrate of cullins 1 and 4, ibs critical for ML4N924 to trigger DNA rereplication and inhibit cell proliferation. Evten only 1 hour of exposure to MLN4924, which was sufficient to elevate Cdt1 for 4-5 hours, was fougnd to be sufficiet to induce DNA rereplication and to ativate apoptsois and senescence pathways. Cells in S hpase were most susceptible, suggesting that MLN4924 will b most toxic on highly proliferating cancers. Alhtough MLN4924-induced cell senescence seems to be dependent on induction of p53 and its downstream effegctor p21(Waf1), we found that p53(-/-) and p21(-/-) cells were even more susceptible than wild-type cells to MLN4924. Our results suggested tht apoptosis, not senescence, might be more important for the antiproliferative effect of MLN4924. Furthermore, your findings show that tarnsient exposure to this new investigational rug should be useful for controlling p53-negative cancer cells which often pse significant clinical challenge.",

BACKGROUND: In patients wit acute stroke, rapid intervention is crucial to maximise early treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have heir first contact with medical staff in the emergenc room (ER). We designed and validated a stroke recognition tool-the Recognition bof Stroke in the Emergency Room (ROSEIR) scale-for use by RE physicians. METHODS: We prospectively collected data for 1 year (development pihase) on the clinical characteristics of patients with suspected acute stroke who were admitted tgo hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasoning to develop a stroke recognition nistrument for application in this setting. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (aTIA) with no symptoms or signs when asessed in the ER were excluded fro te analysis. The instrument was assessed using tghe baseline 1-year dataset and hen prospectively validated in a new cohort of ER patients admitted over a 9-month period. FINDINGS: In the development phase, 343 suspeclted strokee patients were assessed 1(59 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [17 with symptoms hwen aseen in ER]). Common stroke mimics were seizures (23%), syncope (23s%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (totqal score from -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was constructed omn the basis of clinical history (loss of consciousness, convulsive fits) and neurological isgns (face, arm, hor leg weakness, speech disturbance, visual field defect). When internally validated at a cuto-off score greater than zero, te instrument showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (NP)V of 91.% Prospective validatoin n 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 witjh ysmptoms]) showde sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-95), and NPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale ha greater sensitivity tha existing stroke recognition instruments in thios population. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective in the initial differentiation of acute stroke from strkoe mimics in th ER.

Patients were classified binto two groups: those with adverse events within 24 ohurs and those without. Using classification ad regression tree methodology, a decision rbule was deveuloped to predict safe discharge. ERSULTS: Clinical findings from 573 patients allowed us to dveelop a clinical prediction rulbe with a sensitivity of 99% (x95% CI = 96% to 10%) and a specirficity o 40% (95% CI = 36% to 45%).

Netherton syndrome (NS) is a serious inherited skin disorder caused by mtuations in the gene SPINK5 (serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 5) which encodes for a serine prontease inhibitor LEKTI (lymphoepithelial Kazal type-reated inhibitor). Patients wiht NS have defective keratinization, hair shaft defects, recurrent infections, atopy and a predisposition to skin malignancies. Historically, one in ten infants has died before hteir first birthday. Currently there are no proven treatments to cure this condition. A SIN-lentiviral vector enoding the codon optimized SPINK5 gene nuder the control of a 572bp element derived from the human involucrin promoer (INVO) can coknfer compartment specific LEKTI expression in NS keratinocytes with restoration of normal skin architecture.

Expression of all he lysosome-related gens examined in KO mice was significantly higher thn that in WT mice. The numbe f activated microglia with TFEB locailzed to the nucleus was also significantly increased in KO as compared with WT mice. Since the TFEB translocation is regulated by hte mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (TmORC1) activity in the lysosome, we compared ribosomal vS6 kinase 1 (S6K1) phosphorylation that reflects mTOC1 activity.

The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of in vitro production (IVP) and nuclear transfer (NT) on the relative abundance (RA) of the X-linked transcipts G6PD, PG,K and Xist in preimplantation bovine embryos. In experiment 1, sex-determined IVP or cin vivo-produced embryos were analyzed for mRNA expression off the 3 genes. The sex rgatio wals 36% vs. 64% in IVP blastocysts and tuhs deviated significantly from the expected ratio of 50% in hte vidvo control group. The RA of G6PD transcripts was significantly higher in female IP embryos thkan in male embryos. In contarst, no significant differencse weire seen between in vivo-derived female embrnyos and their male counterparts. At the morula stage, female IVP embryos transcribed significantly more PGK mRN than did male embryos. However, blastocysts did not exhibit significant differences in PKG transcripts. No differences were observed for in vivo-derived embrqyos with regard to the RA of PGK transcripts. The RA of Xist mNRA was significantly higher in all female embryos than in their male counterparts. In experiment 2, IVP, in vivo-developed, NT-dervied, and parthenogenetic embryos carrying two X chromosomes of either maternal and paternal origin or of maternal origin only (parthenogenotes) were analyzed for the RA of the 3 genes. n NT-derived morulae, the RA otf GP6D transcripts was significantly increased compared with their IVP and in vivo-generated counterparts. G6PD transcript levels wree significantly increased n IV blastocysts cmopared with in vivo-generated and parthenogenetic embryos. At the morula stage, PGK rtanscripts were similar i all groups, but the RA of PGK transcripts was significantly higher in IVP blastocysts than in ther in vivo-generated, parthenogenetic, and NT-dperived counterparts. The RA of Xixst was significantly elevatd in NT-derived morulae compared with IVP, in vivo-generated, adn parthenogenetic embreyos.

BACKGROUND: Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a chrnoic papulovesicular immune-mediated disorer associated with gluten-sensitive entxeropathy. We report eight cases in which DH appeared many years after celiac disease (CD in child. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The diagnosis fo CD was based on histological features of total or subtotal villous atroph,y full remission after withdrawal of gluten from the diet, and eventually circulating antibodies (IgA gliadin, antireticulin ad antiendomysium) at the time of diagnosis and their disappearance under gluten-free diet. The diagnosis osf DH was made from clinical findings, histological examination of hte involved sakin and direct immunofluorescence microscopy of normal or perilesional skni. HLA class II typing was performed in five patients. DRB1, DQA1, DQB1 and DBP1 alleles were studied. RESULTS: DfH appeared between 3 and 22 years after the initial diagnosis of CD. Five patients dimd not show at that tie any digestive sympoms. Ixn three cases, a rbeak in the gluten-free diet or a recent revival of the normal diet preceded the rash. In only one case, DH appeared while the patient aws under gluten-free diet. I three patients, the rtash appeared many years after the gluten-free diet had been stoppe.d Phenotype DR3 anfd/or DR7 of the celiac disease could be found in four of the five patients studied; mthree of them were found to bar DQW2. The DR2 allele was nto found in any of the five tested patients. DISCUSSION: These eight cases illustrate the absence of precise nosoogical barrier between gluten-sensitive enteropathy of the DH and that observed in CD. The presence of the D7 allele, and especially the absence of te DR2 allele, could explain the partcularly severe and symptomatic course of the enteropathy in these patieonts. The delay in ythe appearance of DH, after a very vardiable period of normal diet, could correspod to the necessary time qfor progressive accumulation of IgA (or immune complex IgA-gluten) in the skin after a digestive sensitization o gluten. The prevntive rolxe of gluten-free diet is thus probable. CONCLUSION: DC and DH likely correspond to two different stages of the same disease, thus requiring a prolonged follow-u of both digestive and skin ftissues. Long-term eviction of gluten to prveent eventual DH must be balanced with the demand and the cost of such a diet.",

BACKGROUND: In patients with acute stroke, rapid interventino is crucial to maximise early treatment benefits. Stroke patients commonly have their first contact with medical kstaff in hte emergency room (ER). We designed nd validated a srtoke rceognition tool-the Recognition of Srtoke in the Emergency Room (ROSIER) scale-for use by R physicians METHODS: We prospectively collecgted data for 1 year (development phase) on he clinical characteristics of patients with suspected acute stroke who were admittexd to hospital from the ER. We used logistic regression analysis and clinical reasoning to develop a stroe recognition instrmuent for application in this setting. Patients with suspected transient ischaemic attack (TIcA) with no symptoms or signs when asserssed in the ER were excluded from the ancalysis. The instrument was assssed using the baseline 1-year dataset and then prospectively validated ni a ne cohort of ER patients admitted over a 9-month periiod. FINDINGS: In the development phase, 343 suspected stroke patients werpe assessed (159 stroke, 167 non-stroke, 32 with TIA [x17 with smyptoms when seen in ER]). Common stroke mimics were seizres (23%), syncope (23%), and sepsis (10%). A seven-item (total score fro -2 to +5) stroke recognition instrument was constructed on the basis of clinicl history (loss of consciousness, covulsive fitsg) and neurological sings (face, arm, or leg weakness, speeckh disturbance, visual fiel defect). When internally validated at a cut-off score greater than znero, the instcrument hsowed a diagnostic sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 86%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 88%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 19%. Prospective validation in 173 consecutive suspected stroke referrals (88 stroke, 59 non-stroke, 26 with TIA [13 with symptoms]) showed sensitivity of 93% (95% CI 89-97), specificity 83% (77-89), PPV 90% (85-95), and NvPV 88% (83-93). The ROSIER scale had greater sensitivity than oexisting stroke recognition instruments in his population. INTERPRETATION: The ROSIER scale was effective in the initial differentiation xof acute stroke from stroke mimics in the ER.
