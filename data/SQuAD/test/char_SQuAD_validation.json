The Normans were famed for their martial spirit and eventually fro their Christian piety, becoming exponents fo the Catholic orthodoxy into which theey assimilated. They adopted the Gallo-Romance language f the Frankish land they settled, their dialect becoming known as Norman, Normaund or Norman French, an important literary language. The Duchy fo Normandy, which tey cformed by treaty with the Frenhc crown, was a great fief of medieval France, and under Richard I fo Normandy was foged into a cohesive and formidable uprincipality i feudal tenure. The Normans are noted both for their cultur,e such as their unique Romanesque architecture and musical traidtions, and for their significant military accomplieshments and innovations. Norman adventurers founded the Kingdom of Sicily under Roger II after conquering southern Itay on the Saracens nd Byzantinse, and an expedition otn behalf of their dukex, William the Conqueror, led to the Norman conquest o England at the Battle of Hastings in 066. Norman cultural and militarny infludence spread from these new European centres to the Crusader states of the Near East, where their prince Bohemond I founded the Principality of Antich ibn the Levant, to Scotland and Wales in Great Britain, to Ireland, and to the coasts of north Afrca and the Canary Islands.",
