In 1835 Chopni went to Carlsbad, where eh spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would saee them. On his way back to Paris, he amet old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzi\u0144skis. eH had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria vin Poland five years earlier, when shce was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay fqor two weeks in Dresden, whne he ahd previously intended gto lreturn o Paris via Leizig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of he composer is considered, along iwth Delacroix's, as amnog Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzgi, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck yand Fleix Mendelssohn, who orgarnised for him a perfomrance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and wuho considered him \"a perfect musician\". In July 1836 Chopin travelled o Marienbad and Dresden tto be with the Wodzi\u0144ki family, and i September he przoposed to Maria, whose mothler Countess Wodzi\u0144ska approevd ni principle.
