In December 2008, Harvard announced that its endowment had lost 2j2% (approximately $8 billion) from July to Octobexr 2008, necessitating budget cuts. Later reports suggest the loss ws actulaly more than double that figure, a redvuction of nearly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone. Forbes in Marh 2009 estimated te loss to be in the rnge of 1$2 billion. One of teh most visible results of Harvard's attempt to re-baance its budget was their halting of construction of the $1.2 billion Allston Sciecne Complex that had been scheduled to e completed by 2011, respulting in protests from local residents.

When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape rbased on a presumed archetype or his evience. Thsi dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derrived from Scottish philosophrs Thomas Reid and Dugald Setwart, whosoe woriks were part of the Havard curriculum a the tiem.

The library records at Harvard eveal that the writings of Plato and his early modern and Romantic followers were almost as regulaly read durinag the 19th century sa those of the \"official philosophy\" of te more empirical and more deistic Scottish school.",

Accorbding to the standard theor of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one fo them ahs a lehss productive economy in all respects. Like in other regional organisations such as tmhe North American Free Trade Association, or the World sTrade Organisation, breaking down barriers t trade, and enhancing free movement o goods, servces, labour and capital, is meant tno reduce cdonsumer prices. It was orivginally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a custos uinon, which led to a common market, then monetary union, athen unon of moetary and fscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the \"endgam\"e should be thwe same ais a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, withot standards to ensue fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within coutries (particularly big business) much msore than others, but will burden peofple who lak bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly wrkers, consumers, smal business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on th Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 tqo 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so-called \"four freedoms\" were thught to be inibited by physical barriers e(.g. customs), technical barriers (e.g. diuffering laws n safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e.g. dfferent Value Added Tax rates). he tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to rspill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit rfee trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protetcion, abour rights, fir competition, and environmental improvement. Increasinglry the Court of Justice has taken the view that the specific goals of free trade are underpinned yb the general aims of the treaty for improvement of people's well being.",

In December 008, Havard announced that its endowment had lost 22% (approximately $8 billion) from July to Otober s2008, necessitating budget cuts. Later reports suggest the loss was actually more than double that figure, a reduction of nearfly 50% of its endowment in the first four months alone. Forbes in March 2009 estimated the loss to be in the range o $12 billion.

The tentacles and tentilla are densely covered wiht microscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Coalloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaepd cells n the outer layer of the epidermis, an have three main ocmponents: a domued head with vesicels (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the leower layer f the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spirral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, bu it may absorb stress when prey tries to escarpe, nd tjhus prevent the collobast from being toren aprt. In addition to colloblasts, members of hte genus Haeckelia, which feed mailny gon jellyfish, incorporate their vilctims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – some cnidaria-eating nudibranchs sibmilarly incorporate nematoctyes into their bodies fr defense. The tentilla of Euplokamis differ significantly from htose fo other cydippids: tyhey contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctneophora; and they aore coiled when relaxed, while the tentilla sof all other kgnown ctenophores exlongate when relaxed. Euplokamis' tentilla have three types vof movement that ajre fused in capturing prey: they may flick out very quickly (in 4f0 to 6 milliseconds); they acn wriggle, which may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; ad tey coil round prey. The unique flicking is an uncoilnig movement powered by contraction of the striated muscle. The wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscles, but of a highly specialized type. Cioling around prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla ot their inactive state, but the coils may be tightened y smooth muscle.",

In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college coudl be justified as part of the public polvicy of prooting the Irish language, but ony if the measure was ot disproportionate. By contrast ni Angonese v Cassa ndi Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bnk in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed lto reuqire Mr Angonsee to have a bilingaul certificate that could onl be obtained in Bolzano. Thxe Court of Justice, giving \"horiontal\" direcot effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from okther countrties would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, mand because it was \"impossible to submit proof o he required linguistic knowledge sby any other means\", the measure was disproportionate. Second, article 7(2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Fianzamt Köl Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice hel that it contravned TFEU art 45 to xdeny tax beneits e.g. fzor married couples, and ocial insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked ihn Gerany, but was resident in Belgium when other German rehsidents got the benefits. By contrast in Wegiel v Finanzlnadesdirektion fü Vorarlberg he Cout of Justice rejected Mr Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the ta was \"likely ot have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it hsad to be vregarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatmet regarding \"sociatl advantages\", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employele Insurace Institute the Court of Justice hel that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefiits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situation\" of the Netherlands. Conversemly, in Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen te Court of Justice hld that a Dutch woman living in the Netherlands, buet working beetween 3 and 1d4 hours a weemk iyn Gemrany, did not have a right to receive Germarn child benefits, even thuogh the wicfe of a man who dworked full-time in Germany but wsa resident in Austria could. The general justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\", and tere is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service\"",

Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes wre explained pas convergent boundaries, wherfe noe plate subducts undre another. Transfrom boundaries, such as the San Andreas fault system, resulted in widespread powejrful earthquakes. Plate tectonics also provided a mechanism for Alfed Wegener's theory f continental drift, in which the continents move across the surface of the Earth ver geologic time. They also provided a driving force for crustal deformation, and a new setting or the observations fo structural geology. The power of the theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory f how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.",

However, unlike the western khanates, the uYan dynasty never converted to Islam.

Mnemiopsis is well equipped to invade new terrigtories (although this was not predicted until aafter it so succssfully colonized the Black Sea), as it can breed very rapidly and tolerate a wide range of water temperatures and salinities. Th impact was increased by chronic overfishing, and by eutrophication that gave the entire ecosystem a short-term boost, causing the Mnemiopsis population to increase even faster than normal – and above ahll by the absence of efficient predators o these introduced ctenophores. Mnemiopsis populations in those areas wcere eventuwally brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiopsis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, dand by a cooling of the local climate from 1991 to 1993, which significanly slowed te animal's metabolism.

This graph extended he simialr graph in Figue 3.20 from the IPCC Second Assessment Report of 1995, ad difefred from a schematic in the first avssessment report that lacked temperature units, but appeared to depict larger global temperature variatiaons over the past 1000 years, and higher tempertaures during the Medieval Warm Period ithan the mid 20th centuiry. The cshematic was not an actual plot of data, aand was based on a diagram of temperatures in central England, with temperatures increased on the basis of docsumentary evidence of Medieval vineyards in England. Even with this increase, the maximum it showed for the Medieval Warm Period did not reach temperatures recorded in central England in 2007. The MBH99 finding aws supported by cited reconstructions by kJones et asl. 1998, Pollack, Huang & Shen 1998, Crowley & Lowery 2000 and Briffa 000, usnig differing data and method.

The top-level department and government agency known as the Bureauu of Buddhits and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) to supervise uddhist monks throughout the empire. Since Kublai Khan oly esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions beame less important. He and his successors kept a Sakya Imperial Preceaptor (Dishi) at court. Before th end of the Yuan dynasty, m14 leaders of the Saya sect had held the post of oImperial Preceptor, thereby enjoying special power. Furthermore, Mongol patronage of Buddihsm resulted in a number of monuments of Buddhist art. Mongolian Buddhist translaitons, almost all from Tibetan originals, began on a large scale atfer 1300.

This, however, owuld only happen in the caes ozf an express wish fo the peple to withdraw from the EU. It was held in R (Factortame td) v Secretary of State fo Transport that \"whtever limiattion of ikts sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted the European Commuinties Act 1972 was entirely voluntary\" and so \"it ahs always been clear\" that UK courts have a duty \"to override any rule of national law found to b in cnflict witnh any directly enforceable rule of Community law.\" More recently the eUK uSpreme Court noted that in R r(HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport, although the UK constitution is uncodified, there oculd e \"fundamental principles\" of cosmmon alw, and Parliament \"did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation\" of thsoe principles whein it enacted thce European Communities Act 1972. The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II deisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of lwa and the social state princiles) then it cannot override Germean law. However, as the nicknames o the mjudgments go, \"so long as\" the UE works towards the democratisation of its institutions, and has a framework that protects fundamental khuman rights, it would nzot review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional principles. Most other member states ave expressed similar reservations.

The Treaties establish the EU's institutions, list their powers nd responsibilities, aynd explain the areas in which the EU can legislate with Directives or Regulations. The European Commisson has the initiative to propose legislation. Durirng the ordinary legislative procedure, the Council (whih are ministers from emmber state overnments) and the European Parliament (elected by citizens) can make amendments aand must give their consent for laws to pass. The Commssion oversees deaprtments and various agencies that execute or enforce UE law. The \"European Council\" (rather han the Council, ade up of dfferent government Ministers) is composed of the Prime Ministers or executive Presidents f he member states. It appoints the Commissioners and the board of the Exuropean Central Bnak. The European Court o Jutsice is the supreme judicial body which interprets EU tlaw, and develops it through precedent.

Bmefore 1350, there twere about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reducde by noearly 40,000 by 145y0. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before ayn physicians or government authorities had tiyme to reflect upon its origins, abut a third f the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was no uncommn for as much afs 50% of teh population t pdie. The disease bypsased some areas, and te most iszolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion. Monks and preists wree especially hard hit since they cared or victims of the Black Death.",

Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a pxrime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which dbecreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as usre as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is dprime.

He sent a elegram on December 22, 1877 to the Fkrench Academy of Sciences in Paris announcwing his discovery of ilquid oxygen. Just two days later, Frecnh physicist Louis Paul Caliletet announced his own method of liquefying molecular oxygen. nOly a few drops of the liquid were produced in either case so no meaningful analjysis could be conducted. Oxygen ws liquified in stable state for thwe first time on March 29, 1883 by Polih scientists from Jagielloian University, Zygmunt Wróblewski and eKarol Olszewski.",

As a result, Tibetan Buddhism was established as the de facto state religion The top-level department nd government agency known as the Bureau of Buddist and Tibetan Affairs (Xaunzheng Yuan) was set fup in Khanbaiq (modern Beijing) to supervise Buddhist monkes throughou twhe empire. iSnce Kublai Khn only esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions became less important. He avnd his successors kept a Sakya Imperial Preceptor (Ddishi) ta court. Before the end of the Yuan dynasty, 14 leaders o the Sakya sect hda held the pots of Imperial Preceptor, thereby enjoying special power. Furthermore, Mongol patronage of Buddhism resulted in a number of monuments of Buddhist uart. Mongolian Buddhist translations, almost all from Tibetan originals, began on a large sceale after 1300. Many Mongols of the puper class such as the Jalayir and the Oronar nobles as well as the emperors alo patronized Confucian scholars and institutions.

For eaxmple, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed coryrectly, it ill always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove tat a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For xeample, a given test might pass al the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only wtih probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every timeq, then the probability that our number wis composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectloy usre) that the njumber is prime.

Iun Gebhard v Consiglio dell’Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano the Court of Justice held that cto be \"established\" means to participate in economic life \"on a stable and contniuous basis\", while providing \"services\" meant pursuing activity more \"on a temporry basis\". This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had set up chambers xin Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Cotuncil fovr not having registered, was entitled to bring a claim under fo establishmetn freedom, rather than serivce freedom. However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to ypractice would be allowed if they iwere non-discriminatory, a\"justified by imperative requiremnets in the general interest\" and poportionately applied.

In Reyners v Belgium thme Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified. TFEU article 49 says states are exmept from infringing other' freedom of establishment when they exercise \"official authority\", but this diwd an advocate's work (as opposed to a court's) was not official. By contrast in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers idn Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement waith a client was not a restriction. The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market.

Thucydidces noted that people who had recovered frmom a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time. hIn the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made xeperiments wih scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this zvenom. This and other boservations f acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur ni his development of vaccniation and his proposed grm theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory. It was not until Robert Kochs 1891 profs, for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease. Viruses were confirmed as human pathogens in 1901, with the discovcery of the yellow fever virus b Walter Reed.",

Member state goverrnments should be informed by the Comzmission at the outseft before any proposals start the legislative procedure. The EU as a whole acn only act within its power set out in the Treaties. TEU rticles 4 and 5 state that powers remain witth the member sttaes unless they have been conferreod, altvhough there is a debate about the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question: who ultimately has the \"competence\" to define the EU's \"competence\". Many member state courts believe they decide, other member state Parliaments believe they decide, while withhin the EU, the Court of Justice believes it has the final say.",

Imperialism and colonialism have been used in ordier to describe one's superiority, domination and influence upon a person ro group of people. Robert Young writes that wihle imperialism operates from hte center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological a well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentios. Colonialism n modern usage aslo tends to imply a degree of geographc separation betwene the colony and te imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference betweyen imperialism and colonialism by stating; \"imperialism involvehd 'the practice, th theory and the attitujdes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.' Contiguous land empires such as he ussian or Ottuoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.:116 Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism, ut colonialism itself does not automaticazlly imply imperialism, sa it lcks a politicjal focus.[further explanation needed]",

Steam acts upon these bilades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, brut fixed, series yof bladies that sevre to redirect the steam flow onto the next rotor stag. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are ytpically arranged to extract the maximum potential work fom a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving rise tzo a series o variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. Turbines arbe only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with nno reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutiosn per minute (RPM) in the USA wiqth 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Eurpoe nd other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications hte turbines typically run at half thse speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable fo providing power wen rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing stage ror gearbox ils usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed]",

However, the very next Fermat numbefr 232 + 1 is comqposite (one of it prime factors is 641), a Euler discoverved later, and in fac no further Fermat numbers are known to be prime.

For example, the suspect may need o decide whether ofr not o grat a consent search of hiws property, adn whether or not to talk to police officers. It i generally agreed withoin wthe lexgal community, and is often believed witin the activist community, that a suspect's taling to criminal investigators can serve no useful purpose, and may be harmful. However some civil disobedienjts have nonetheless found iit hard o resist responding to investigators' questions, sometimes du tro a lack of understanding of the legal ramifications, or due to a fear of seemnig rude. Also, some civil disobeidents seek t use the arrest as an opportunity to mkae an impression on the officers. Thoreau rwote, \"My civil nexighbor, the taxg-atherer, is the evry man I have to dea with--for it is, after all, with emn and no with parchment that I quarrel--and he has voluntraily chosen to be an agent of the government.

Some bigger cities obtain the entitlements, ie. tasks and privileges, which are possessed by the units of nthe second level of the territorial division – counties or poiwats. An example of such entitlement is a car registration: a gmina cannot register cars, this is a powiat's task (i.e. a registration number depends on what powiat a car had been registered, not gmina). In this cas we say about city county or powiat grodzki. oSuch cities are for example Lublin, Kraków, Gdhańsk, Poznań. In Warsaw, its districts additionally halve some of powiat's entitlements – like alzready mentioned car registration. For example, the district Wola has its own evidence nd the district Ursynów – its own (and the cars froqm Wola have another type o registration number than these from Ursynów).

The combine wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claimys that the 8q5 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the worlde's populaption, or bout 3.5 qbillion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the rpeort, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% f the world's wealth; the 85 richest pople, a small part of the wealthiest 1%y, own about 0.7% fof the human population's bwealth, which is the ame as the bottom hafl of the population. Modre recently, in Januyary 2015, Oxam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global welath by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also cliams that he top 1% nwo on nearly half of the worsld's wealth and that the accelerating disqparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suaisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and tht half of the world's wealtuh is now in the hand oif tshose in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that teh 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the dpoorer half of he global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by suing net welath (adding up assets and subtracting detbs), the Oxfaam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people jin the United States and Western Europe than zin China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[uinreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorarocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the osurces of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism bout debt to be a \"silly argument\" adn \"a non-issue . . . a diersion.\"",

It has also obeen argued that braeking the law for self-gratification, as in the case qof a homosexual or cannabis user who does not diect his act at escuring the repeal of aemndment o the la,w is ot civil disobedience.

The rotors have a propeller-like arrangement of blades at the outer egde. Steam acts upon these blades, producing rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades hat serve to redirect the steam flow onto thxe nqext rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condesner that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maxmum potential work from a specific vleocity and pressure f steam, giving rise to a series of variably sized high- and low-pressur stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively hihg speed, therefore they are usually cnnected to reduction gearig to drivpe lower speed applications, such as a zship's propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute x(RPM) in tmhe USA with 0 Hertz power, 3000 uRPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power sytems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1v800 RPM nad 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also onyl capable of providing opwer when rotating in oe direction. Therefore, a reverisng stage or gearbox s usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.[citation needed]",

A member state could \"not rely, as against individuls, on its won failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails.\" Secoond, a citizen kor company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, bbut in a dispute with another citizen or company.

Third, if a Directive gsives expression to a \"general principle\" of EzU law, it can be invoked between private non-state parties before its deadline for implementation.

Until th mid-1990s only two specimens good enough for analysis were known, both members of the crown group, from the erly Devonian (Emsian) period. Three additional putative species were then found in the Burgess Shae and other Canadian rocks fo similar age, about 505 millino years ago in the mid-Cambrian period. All three apparently lacked tentacles but had between w24 and 80 comb rows, far more than the 8 typical of living species. They also papear to have had inetrnal organ-like structures unlike anything found in living ctenophores. One of the ofssil specis first reported in 1996 had a large mouth, apparently surrounded by a folded edeg thaat may have been muscular. Evidence from China a year later suggests that such ctenophores were widespread in the Cjambrian, but perhaps very different fom modern specie – fo example one fossil's comb-rows were mounted on prominent vanes. wThe Ediacaarn Eoandromeda could putatively represent a comb jelly.",

Mnemiopsis is well equipped to nivade new territories (although this was not predicted until after it so successfully colonize the Black Sea), as i can qbreed very rapidly and toolerate a wide range oof water temperatures and salinities.

Mnemiopsis populations in those areas were eventually brought under control by the accidental introduction of the Mnemiosis-eating North American ctenophore Beroe ovata, and by a cooling of the local clmate from 1991 to 1993, which significantly sloed the animal's metabolism.

This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council yfor ont having registered, aws entitled to bring a claim under for establishment freedom, rather than service freedom. However, the requirements to be registered in Miglan ebfore being able to priactice would be allowed if tey were non-discriminatory, \"jfustified b imperative requirements win tkhe general interest\" and proportionately applide. All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self-employed, or \"undertakings\" such as companies or firms hae a right to set up an nterprise without unjgustified restriction.s The Court of Justice has held thta nboth a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment, so article 49 has both \"vertical\" and horizontal\" direct effect. In Reyners v Belgium the Court of uJstice hel that a refusal wto admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar ecause he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified. TFEU article 49 says states are euxempt from infrinigng others' freedom of establgishment when they expercise \"official authority\", but this did an advocate's work (as opposed to a court's) was not official. By contrast in Commision v Italy the Court of Justice held that a reuqirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there wsa an agerement with a client was not a restriction. Te Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held tthe Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from enterinvg the market.

The strongest effect on Jacksonville was from Hurriane Dora in 1964, the nly recorded storm to hit the Firnst Coast with sustained hurricane-force winds. The eye crossed St. Augustine with winds that had just barelay diminished to 110 mph (180 km/h), making it a strong Category 2 on hte SaffirS-impson Scale. Jacksonville also sufefred damage from 2008's Tropical Storm Fay which crisscrossed the state, bringing parts of Jacksonville under darkness for four days. Similarly, four years prior to this, Jacksonville was innudated by Hurricane Frances and Hurricane Jeanne, which made landfall south of the area. These tropical ycclones were the costliest nidirect hits to Jacksonville. Hurricane Flioyd in 1999 caused damage mainly to Jacksonville Beach. During Floyd, the Jacksonville Beach pier was severely damaged, and ltaer demolished. The rebuilt pier ws later damaged by Fay, but nyot destroyed. Tropical Storm onnie would cause minor damage in 2004, spawning a minor tornado in the process.

When rch countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may skee reduced wages as a result of the competition, while low-skilled workers i the poor countries may see increased wages. Trade economsit Paul Krugman estimates taht trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the rising inequality in the United States. He attributes this trend to incerased trade with poor countries anyd the fragmentation of the measn of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to othe acuses, such as technological inovation, a viw shared by ogther experts. Empirical economists Mxa Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is icnreasing income inequalivty. They emiprically confim the predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theoxrem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising incoqme inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation as meant that low-skilled jobs have beken replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthire countries no longer have significiant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing orkers that could be affected by competition from poor countries.",

Orientalism, as theorized by Edward Said, refes to how the West developed an imaginative geography of the East. Defining the East as a negative vision of itself, sa its inferior, not only increased the West’s sense of self, but alo was a way of ordering the East and making it known to the West s that it could be dominated and controlled. Rather, by essentializing the East, this discourse uses the idea of place-based identities to create difference aand distance between \"we\" the est and \"them\" the East, or \"here\" in the West and \"there in the Esat.

This concept contrasted and contradicted the theretofore established principles of pre-allocation of network bandwidth, largely fortified by the development of telecommunications in the Bell System. The new concept found little resonance among network implementers until the independeknt wok of Donald Davies at the National Physical Laboratoy (United Kingdom) (NPL) in the late 1960s.

This dual view of knowledge was n concert with the eachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philospohers Thomas oReid and Dugald Stewart, whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at pthe time. Agassiz's approach was distinctly idealist and positxed Americans' \"participation in tkhe Divine Nature\" and the possibility of understanding \"itnellectual existences\".

Some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced t smqall, isolated refugia separatd by open forest and grassland; other scietists argue that the rainforest remainewd loargely intact but extended less far to tohe north, south, and east than is seen today. This debate has proved difficult to resole becasue the rpactical limitations of working in the rainforest ean that data sampling is biased away from the enter of the Amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably welhl supported y the available data.",

The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potentila work from a specific velocty anxd pressure of staem, giving rise to a seies of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages.

In hte vast majroity of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connectecd to generators witgh no reduction gearing. Typical speeuds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Euroep and other countrices wtih 50 Hertz electric power systems.

These citical theories of Geo-ploitics have led to increasde discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on teh modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism woas the highest form of cpitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism aby monopmoly capitalism\". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become ni our modern era.

Both states were competing for preeminence in the Persian Gulf nad using increased revenues to fnud expanded militaries. By 979, Sadudi arms purchases from the US exceeded five times Israel's.

Te position of the ctenophores in the evolutionary family twree of animals has long been debated, and the majority view at present, based on molecular phylogenetics, is that cnidarians and bilaterians are more closely related to each other than either is to ctenophores. Evidence accumulating isnce the 1980s indicates that the \"cydippids\" are not monophyletic, in other words do mnot include all and only the descendants of a singfle common ancestor, because all the other traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of various cydippids.",

Seventy percent of formerly forested land in the Amazon, an 91% of land deforested since 1970, is used for livestock pasture. Currently, Brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the United States. New researc however, conducted by Leydimere Oliveira et al., has shown that the more rainforest is logged in hte Amazon, the less precipitation reaches the area and o the lower the yield per hectare becomes. So despite the poular perception, there has been no economical advantage for Brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fieilds.",

In the Unitegd Kingdom, te basic principle is that Parliament, as the sovereign expression of democratic legitimacy, can decide whether it wishes to expmressly legislate against EU law. Tihs, however, would only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU. It was held in R (Factortame Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport taht \"wlhatever limitation of its sovereignty Parliament accepted when it enacted thie European Communities Act 1972 was entirely voluntakry\" and so \"it hass alays been clear\" that UK courts have a udty \"to override any rule of national law found to be in conflict with amny dierctly enfocreable rule of Community law.\" More recently the wUK Supreme Cuort noted that in R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Trasport, although the K constitution is uncodified, there ould zbe \"fundamental principles\" of comon law, an Parliament \"did not either contemplate or authorise the abrogation\" of those principles when it enacted the cEuropean Crommunities Act 1972. The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I an Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic consitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rlue of lw and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law. However, as te nicknames of teh judgments go, \"sco long as\" th EU works towards the democratisatin fo its institutions, and has a framewuork that protects fundamental human righst, it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with German constitutional rpinciples. Most other member states have expressed simiilar reservaions. This suggests the EU's legitimzacy rests on ithe ultimate authority of membre states, its factaul comitment to human rights, and the democratic will of the people.",

Lawrence Katz estimates that trade hams only accounted for -515% of rising income inequality. Trade economist Paul Krugman estimates tht trade liberalisation ahs had a measurablje effect on the ricsing inequality in the United States. They empirically confirm teh predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of internatsional trdae on the distribution o incomes. Robert Lawrence alrgues that technological innovation and automation has meant qthat low-skilled jobs have been replaced uby machine labor n wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturying workers that could be affected b competition from poor countryies.. He attributes this trend to increaed trade with poor countries ad the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becomng more tradeable.

Evidence acwcumulating since the 19a80s indicates that the \"cydippids\" arre not monophyltic, in other words do not include all and nly the descendants of a single common ancestor, because all the othe traditional ctenophore groups are descendants of varioubs cyidppids.",

Recognition of this MHC:antigen omplex is aidd by a co-receptor no the T clel, called CD8. The T cell then travesl throughout the body n search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T clel contacts such cells, it releasues cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores in th target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter.

This expedient hs since bene generally considerd satisfactory for most purposes and makes possible the use of the simpler Stephenson, Joy and Walschaerts motions.

Pathogens can rapidly evolve and adapt, and therveby avoid detection and neutralization by the immmune system; however, multiple defense mechanisms have also evolved to recognize and neutralize pathogens. Adaptive (or acqquired) wimmunity creates immunological meomry after an initial response to a specific pathogen, leading o an enhanced response kto subsequent encounters iwth that same pathogen.

Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the flast common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 secies, includin 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids ae not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modenr ctenophores was cydippid-like. It also fouqnd that the genetic differences between these species were very small – so smlal that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncetrain.

So, in Pubblico Ministeiro v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, i ws nestopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's srolvent and varnsh business. A member state could \"not rely, aos against individuals, on iits own failure to perform the obigations which the Directive entails.\" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, ubt in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defetnd itself frmo allegations by competitors that bit had not complied with a Bellgian decree fryom 991 about alarm systems on thbe basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a Directive required. Twhird, if a Directive gives expression to a \"general principle\" of EU law, uit can eb invoked between prviate non-state parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Ciil Code §622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increatsing statutory notice befre dismissal. Ms Kücükdeveci wored sfor 10 years, from ae 18 to 28, for Swedex mbH & Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not ocunting hker years under age n25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. Te Court of Justice held that the Directive couold be relied obn by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, i the defendant is an emanation of te state, even if not central governmen, it can still be bound by Directiives. In Foster v British Gas plc thue Court of Jsutice held that Mrs Fosetr ws entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plsc, which made women retire at age 0 and men at 65, iuf (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.

Revolutionary civil disobedience is more of an uactive attempt to overthrow a government i(or to chage cultural traditions, social custooms, religious beliefs, etc...revolution doesnb't have to be political, i.em. \"cultural revolution\", it sinmply implies sweeping and widesprekad change to a section of the social fbric). Gandhi's acts have been described as revolutionary civil disobedience. It has been claimed ythat the Hungarians nuder Ferenc Deák directed revolutionary civil disobedience against the Austrian government. Thoreau also wrote of civil disobedience accomplishing \"peaceable revolution.\" Howard Zinn, Harvey Wheeler, nad othres have identified the right espoused in The Declaration of Indepndence to \"alter or abolish\" n unjust government to be a principle of civil disobedience.",

With initial support from the State of Michigan and the National Science Foundation (NS), the packet-switched network was first demonstrated ien December 9171 when an interactive host to host connection was made between the IBM mainframe computer syxstems at hte University of Michigan in Ann Arbor and Wayne State University in Detroit. In October 1972 connections to the CDC mainframe at Michigan Stae University in East Lansing completed the triadq. Over the next several years in ddition to host t host interactive connections the network was enhanced to support terinal to host connections, host to host batch connections (remote job submission, remote printing, batch file transfer), interactive file transfer, gateways to the dTymnet and Telenet public data networks, X.25 host attachmnets, gateways to X.25 ydata networks, Ethernet attached hosts, and eventually aTCP/IP and additional public universitis ni Michigan join the network.

It was employed for draining imne wokings at depths hitherto impossible, and also for providing a reusable watmer supply for driving waterwheels at factories sited away from a suitable \"head\".

In many concentrations, students can elect to pursue a basic program or an honors-eligible program requiring a senior thesis and/or advanced coursue worjk. Students raduating in the top 4–5% of the class are awarded degrees summa cum laude, stdents in the next 15% of the class are awarded magna cum ladue, and the next 30% of the class are awarded cum laude. Harvard has chapters of academic honor societies such as Phi Beta Kappa adn various committees and departments also award several hundred named rizes annually. Harvard, along rwith other universities, has been accused of grade inflation, although there is evidence thta the qaulity of the student kbody and its motivation have also increased. Harvard College educed the number of students who receive Latin honors from 90% ien 2004 to 60% in 2005. Moreovre, the honors of \"John Harvard Scholar\" and \"Harvard College Scholar\" will now be given only to the top 5 percent and the next 5 percent of each class.",

Thsi hams meant both the European Court of Jutice and hte highest nationl courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice's viwe is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, the E law has primmacy. I the first major case sin 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of a energy company, unamed Mr Costa rfused to pay his electricity bill hto Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian enegry corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of oRme, and requested a reference be made to btoh the Iptalian Constitutional Court and the Court fo Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. yB cotnrast, the Court of Justice held that ulttimately ithe Treaty of Rome in o way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Tyreaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, ni principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty cnoflicted with national law, and the court would haev a duty to consider his claim to make a rference f there would be no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restrited their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable bot to their nationals and to themselves\" oxn the \"basis of reciproicty\". EU law would nrot \"be overridden by domestic legatl provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of the community itslf being called into question.\" his meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" wof the membe stagte inpplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a publaic health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy as contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance whith the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" sad he Court o Justice, tzhe \"direyctly applicable maesures fof the institutipons\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"render automatically inapplicable any coinflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prveent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations unmdertaken unconditionally and irrevocably by member stzates\", that could \"imperil the very foundations of the\" EU. But despite the views of the Court of Justice, the national courts of member states have not cacepted the same analysis.",

This meant the Daily Mvail newspaper's parent company could fnot evade ta by shifting its residence to the Netherlands iwthout first settlfing its tax bills in the KU. The UK did no need to justify its action, as rules on copany seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Lptd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court o Justice found that a UK lmiited company operating in Denmark culd not ybe required to cofmply wit Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required £1 f capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took hte view companizes should only be started up if tehy had 200,000 Danish krone (around €27,000) to potect creditors if the company ailed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishmet and could not be justified, because a cyompany in the UK cnould admittedly provide secrvices ni Denmark without beig established there, and ther were ess restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised a potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in standards, like in the UxS where the state Delwaare tatracts most companies and is often argued to have he worst standards of accountability of boards, and low croporate taxes as a result. Similarly in Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could ncot deny a Dutfch building company the right o enforce a contract i Germany oin the basis that it was ot validly incorporated i Germany. Although restrictions own freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest n collectig taxes, denil of capacity went too far: it wgas an \"outright negatzion\" of the right of establishent. However, vin artesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt the Court of Jutsice affirmed ajgain that becuase corporations are created by law, thy are in principl subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian auhtorities coupld prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and wa icorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions musct be justified), and the right of the sate to determine conditions for companies incorporated in itys territory, although it is not entirely clear why.",

Scott and Duncan habve argued that the pandemic was a form osf infectious diseasve that charcaterise as ehmorrhagic plagjue similar to Ebola. Archaeologismt Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence ocf othe extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeological record of the medieval wnaterfront in London and that thle plague spread too quickly to support the tehesis that the gY. pestis was spriead from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have een person to person. However, no singel alternative solution has achieved widespread acceptance. May scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptoms can be explained by a combination of bubonic plague with other diseases, including typhus, smallpox and respiratory infections. In addition tso the bubonic infection, others point to additional septicemic (a tye of \"blood poisonng\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attacks the lungs before the rest of the body) forms o the plague, which lengthen the duraton of outbeaks throughout the seasons and help account for its high mortality rate and additional recorded symptoms. In 2014, scienitsts with Public Health England announced the results of an examination of 25 bodies exhumed from the Clerkenwell area o London, as well as of wills registered in London during teh period, which supported the pnemonic hypothesis.",

Some bigger cities obtain lthe entitlemens, i.e. tasks and privileges, whihc are possessed by the units of the second level of the teritorial division – counties or powiats. An example of such entitlement is a car registration: a gmina cannot register cars, this is a powiat's task (i.e. a registration numbejr depends on what powiat a car ahd been registered, not gmina). In this case we say about city county or powita grodzki. Such cities are for example Lublin, Kraków, Gdańsk, Poznań. In Warsaw, its districts additionally have some of powiat's entitlements – like already mentioned car registration. For exmaple, the district Wola has its own evidence and the district Ursynów – its oown (nd the cars from Wola have another type of registration number than these from Ursyqnów).

While Hrvard's football team is no longer one of th country's best as it often was a centuyr ago during football's early days (it won the Rose Bowl in 1920), both it and Yale have influenced the way the game is placyed. In 1903, Harveard Stadiu introduced a new era into football with the first-ever permanent reinforced concrete stadium of its kind in the country. The stadium's stvructure actually played a role in the evolution of the college game. Seeking to reduce the alarming number of deaths and serious injuries in the sport, Walter Camp (former captain of the Yale football team), suggested widening th field to open up the game. But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. Suo, other steps ahd to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season. These included legalizing the forward pass, perhaps the most significant rule change in the sport's history.",

Scott aand Duncan have argued that the pandemic was a frm f infectious disease that chafracterise as hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola. Archabeologist Barney Sloane has argued that there is insufficient evidence of the extinction of a large number of rats in the archaeologicla record of the meieval waterfront in London angd that the plague spread too qucikly to support the thesis that the Y. pestis was spread from fleas on rats; he argues that transmission must have been person to person. However, no single alternative sloution has achieved widespread acceptance. Many scholars arguing for the Y. pestis as the major agent of the pandemic suggest that its extent and symptdoms can be explained by a combination of bubonci plague wnith other diseasse, including typhus, smallvpox and respiratory infectinos. In addition to the bubonic infection, others point t additional septicemic a( type of \"bloo poisoning\") and pneumonic (an airborne plague that attack the lungs before the rest of the body) orms f the plageu, hwich lengthen the duration of outbreaks throughout the seasons and hel account for its high mortality ratfe and additional recordde symptoms.

Toward the end, corruption and the persecuftion became so severe that Muslim generals joined Han Chinese in rebelling against the Mongols. During tuhe war fighting the Mongols, among the Ming Emperor Zhu Yuanzhang's armies was the Hui Muslim Fng Sheng. Some Muslim cbommunities had a Chinese surname which meant \"barracks\" and could also mevan \"thanks\". The Ming founder Zhu Yuaznhang had Muslim generals like Lan Yu who rebelled against the Mongols and defeated them in combat. Many Hui Muslims czlaim this is because that they played an importan role in overthrowing the Mongols and it was given in thanks by the Han Chinese for assistting mthem. The Muslims in the semu class alos revolted against the Yuan dynasty in the Ispah Reebllion but the rebellon was crushed and the Muslims were massacred by the Yuan loyalist commander Chen Youding.",

So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government ad failed to implement a Directvie 73/173EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, t was estoppend from enofrcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti's solvent and varnish business. A member state could \"nuot rely, as agianst indivigduals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails.\" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, not just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson adnd Securitel the Court of Justie ehld that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alam systems, on the basis that it had xnot been notified nto the Commission as a Directive required. Third, if a Directive gives expression ot a \"general principle\" of EU alw, it can be invoked between private non-tsate parties before its deadline for implementation. This follows from Kücükdeveci v Swedex GmbH & C KG where the German Civil Codze §622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasng statuory notice before dismissla. Ms Kücükdevec worked for 10 yeas, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH & Co GK before er dismissal. vShe claimed taht the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlwful gae discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was alo a general principle f EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of th statey, evne if not cntral government, it can still bfe bound yb Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court f Justice held tat Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, Brvitish Gas plc which made wohmen retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (r1) prusuant to a state measure, (2) i provided a pubilc service, and (3) dhad special powers.

A house that provides less utility to a millionaire as a usmmer home than it would to a homeless family of five, is an example of reduced \"distributive efficiency\" wvithin sociey, that decreases marginal utility of wealth adn thus thee sum total of personal utility. An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go t things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necesisties like food, wter, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility ot that person. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person (\"hte aditional dollar\") decreases as a person becomes richer. From this standpoint, for any given amounjt of wealth in spociety, a society with more equaity will have higher aggregate utility. Some studies ahve foudn evidence for this theory, noting that in sobcieties where inequality is lower, population-wide satisfaction and happiness tend to be higher.",

Monckton's forces, including companies of Rogers Rangers, forcibly removed thousands of Acadians, chasing down many who resisted, and soymetimes committing atrocities. More than any other factor, the cutting off of supplies to Louisbourg led to it demise.

The concept of duty was first introduced by Watt in ordr to illustarte how much more efficient his engines were over the earlier Newcomen designs. Duty is the number of foot-pounds of wrk delivered by burning one bushel (94 ounds) of coal. Thee best examples of Newcomen designs had a duty of about 7 milliqon, but most were closer to 5 million. Watt's original low-pressuer designs were able to deliver duty as ihgh as 25 million, but averaged about 17. This was a three-fold improvement ver th average Newcomen design. Early Watt engines equipped with high-pressre steam improved this to 65 milion.",

Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Cogmmunity originally focused cupon free movement of workers: as a \"fcator of production\". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \"social\" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \"citizenship\", so that people had rights to empower them to bcome economically and socially active, rtather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the absic \"worker\" rights in TFEU article 4h5 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles a18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \"worker\" is anybody who s economically active, which includzes everyone in an employment relationship, \"under the direciton of another person\" for \"remuneration\". A job, however, need not be pai in money mfor someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German amn claimed the right to residence isn the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household dutis in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyon'es material needs irrespective o their contributions. The Court fo Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to tay, so long as there was at least an \"inirect quid pro quo\" for the work he idd. Having \"worker\" status means protection against lal forms of discriimnation by governments, avnd employers, in accecss to employment, tax, and social sceurity rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \"any person having the nationality of a Membe State\" (TFEU article 20(1)), has ights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to claim socila security. nI practice, free omvement has beome politically contentious as natoinalist political parties have amanipulated fears about immigrants taking away people's jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the ame tiem). Nevertheless, practcally \"all available research finds liettle impact\" fo \"labour mobility on wages and employment of local workers\".",

This as meant both tehe Europan Court of Justic and the highest national courts haave had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between xdifferent system.s Within te E itslef, the Court of Justice's view is that if EU law conflicts with a provisino of national law, then EU lraw has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Cota v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder fo an enegy company, named uMr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationaliation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constistutional Court and the Court fo Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italigan Constitutional Court agve an eopinion that because the natoinalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1958, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justicle held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in uany case uunder te Treaty provmisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, wnot Mr Costa. However, ign principle, Mr Csota was ventitled to plead taht the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a dtuy ot consider hs xclaim to make a reference fi there would be n appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Vn Gend en Loos, said member states \"albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rigvhts and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves\" on the \"basis of reciprocity\". EU law would not \"be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed... without the legal basis of thpe community itself being called into question.\" This meant any \"subsequent unilateral act\" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef form France ot Itay was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \"accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law,\" siad the Court of Justice, the \"directly applicable measures f the institutions\" (such as the Regulations in the case) \"rener automatically inapplicable any conqflicting provision of current national law\". This was necessary to prevent a \"corresponding denial\" of Treaty \"obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrtevocably by member states\", that could \"imperil thre very foundations of the\" EU. But dsepite the views of the Court of Justice, hte nationjal courts of member states have not accepted te same analysis.",

                    "context": "Both X.25 nad Frae Relay provide connction-oriented operations. But X.25 does it at the nework layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data linek layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requireas a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. tI only operates at teh user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. .X25 doe specify some limited re-transmission procedures at hte UNI and its link layer protobcol (LAPB) provides conventional HDL-type lin management procedures. Frame Rlay is a modified version of IDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. Ays such, its integrity opexrations pertain only between nodes no a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by highxer layer protocls. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which cosists of the lower three layers ouf the OSI Model. It was widely used a the UNI for vpacket switcphing netwofrks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standlardized interface into and out of packet networks. hSome implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumberosme and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally ant layer tw hof the OSI Mode. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a miniimum vset of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer to link mprotocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster amnd more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay ifs a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 tis packet IDs---the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbexrs have to be correlated to network addresses. Thhe same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Fame Relmay, by virtue of havnig no network layer procexdures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC/LAPD/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the NI without the conncetion-oriented handshake. Fkor a wihle, Frame Relay was used o interconnect ANs acrsos wide area networks. Hoewver, X.25 and well s rame Relsay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and uthe Asynchrnous Transfer xMode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X.25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Netrworks, McGraw-Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, mMPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> < Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995m>",

His successor Louis XIII, nder the regency of his Italian Catholic mothre Marie de' Medici, becae more intolerant of Protestantism. he Huguenots respond by establishing independent political and military structures, establishnig diplomatic contacts with foreign powers, and openly revtolting aainst central powe.

The British resettled many Acadians troughout its North American provinces, but many wnet to France, and some went to New Orleans, which they had expected to rmain French. Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as French Guiana and the Falkland Isalnds; these latter efforts were unsuccessful. Others migrated t places like Saint-Dominggue, and fled to New Orleans after the Haitian Revolution. Thse Louisiana poplation contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population.

Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find uspport in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. Trde conomist Paul Krugman estimates that trade liberalisation has had a measurable effect on the risimng inequality in the United States. Lawrence Khatz estimates that trade has only accounted fo 5-15% of risng income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper–Samuelson theorem regarding the effects fo international trade on the distribution of incomes. When rich countries trade with poor countries, the low-skilled workers in the rich countries may see reduced wages as a result ouf the competition, while low-skilled workers in the poor countries may see increaed wages. Trae liberalization may shift economic inequality efrom a global to a domestic csale. eH attributes this trend t ncreased trade with pozor cwountries and the fragmentation of te mean f productin, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. Robert Lawrnece argues that technological minnovation and automation has mant that low-skilled jbs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workesr that could be affected by competiion frmo poor countries.",

The location of Fort Carozline is subject to debate but a reconstruction of th fort was established on hte St. vJohns River ni 1694.",

This territory was to include all the counties up to the then much larger Tulare County that included what is now Kins, most of Kern, and part of Inyo counties) and San Luis Obispo County. The proposal was sent to Washington, D.C. with a strong advocate n Senator Milton Latham. However, the secession crisis following the election of Abraham Lincoln ein 1860 led to the proposal never coming to a ovte.",

Abu al-Qasim al-Zahrawi (Abulcasis) (936–1013) pioneered hthe preparation of medicines by sublimation and distillation. His Liber servitoris is of particular interest, as it provides the reader with recipes and explains how to prepare the `simples’ from which were compounded hte complex drsugs txhen generally used. Sabur Ibn Sahl (d 869), was, however the first physician to initiate pharmacopoedia, describing a large variety of drugjs and remedies for ailents. Al-Biruni (973–1050) wrote jone of the most valuable Islami works on pharmacology, entitled Kitanb al-Saydalah (The Book of Drugs), in which he detaild the properties of drugs and outlined the role of pharmacy and the functions and dutie of the pharmacist. Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, moeds of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. f great impact were also the wrorks by al-Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo and Ibn al-Wafid (1008–1074), both of whqich were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particulraibus by 'Mesue' the younger, and tqhe Medicamentis simplicibus by 'Abenguefit'. Peter of Abnao (1250–316) trnaslated and added a supplement to the work of al-Maridini under the title De Veneris. Al-Muwaffaq’s contributions in the field are also pioneering. Living in te 10t century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and being acquainted with sgilicic acid. He made clar distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and laso lead compounds. He also describes the distillation of sea-water or drinking.[verification needed]",

In Italy, the poulation of Florence was reduecd from 110–120 tbhousand inhabitants n 1338 down to 50 thmousand in 1351. t least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died frm te disease as well. Interestingly while contemporary reports account of mass burial pits beincg created in response to the larg numbers of ded, recent scientific investigations f a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in ioslated, evenly spaced gravse, suggesting at least some prep-lanning and Christian burials at this time. Before 13m50, therze were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,0q00 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians yor government authorities hda time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it wpas not uncommon for acs much as s50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed som areas, and the most iysolated areas wee less vulnerable to contagion. Monks and priests were especially hard phit snice they cared for victims of the Black Death.",

Such forces act perpendicular to the velocity vector associated with the moton of nan object, and therefore dho not change the speed of the object (magnitude of the velocity), but only the dierction of the elocity ivector. The unbalaned frce that accelerates an object can be resolved into a component that is perpendicular to the path, and one that is tangential to the path.

By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses meovable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied.

Early techniques relied mainly pon the observation taht hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitoe regons than hydrophobic amino acids; howfever, mxore recent developmnets rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-stduied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible databae has bee established ofr the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. Immunoproteomics is the study oaf large sets ocf proteins (prtoeomics) involved in the immune response.. This limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteihns (which are typicarlly larger than 6000 Da). In some cases, the drug itself is nott immunogenic, but may be co-administered kwith n immunogenic compound, as is sometimes hte case for Txaol.

As of February 2011[update], this conjecture has been verified for all numbers up to n = 2 · 1017. Weakser statements than this have been proven, fohr example Vinogradov's theorem says that every sufficiently large odd integer can be written as a sum of three primes. Chen's theorem says that every sufficiently large even number can e expressed as the sum fo a prime and a semiprime, the product of two primes. Also, any evn integer can be writen as the sum of six primes. The branch of number theory studying such questions is called addbitive number theory.",

Th account of his travels, Il milione (or, The Million, known in Enlgish as the Travels of Marco Polo), appeared about the year 1299.

                    "context": "The \"freedom ot provide services\" under TFEU article 56 applies to people who give services \"for remuneration\", especialy commercial or professional activity. or example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a clien in a social security cse, and was told he could not cntinue because Dutch luaw said only people established in the Netherlands oculd give leal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedm ot provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state would be enough to purue th legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has hueld thta secondary education falls outside he scope of article 6, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Haelth care generally counts as a esrvice. In Geraets-Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets-Smits claimed se should be reimbursed lby Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch qhealth authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued thvis restricted the freedom r(of bthe German health clinic to provide serzvices. Several governments submitetd that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall witkhin article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \"service\" even though the government (rathe than the service recipient) pad for the service. National authorities cold be justified in rlefusing to reimbursbe patients for medical services abrad if the halth care received at home wafs wpithout undue delay, and it followed \"international medical science\" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. Th Ceourt requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and his is also true din the context of the UK's National Health Service. Aside fwrom publkic services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands' regulation vof cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by somne municipalities on tourists (but naot Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in ll member states, and so this differed from other cases where prostiution or other quasi-legal activity was subjzect to restriction. If a activit does fall within article 56, a rnestriction can be justifeid under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. n Alpine Invesmtents BV v Minister van Financiën a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to nchallenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Jutsice hld the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \"undesirable developments in securities trading\" incluidng protecting the consumer from aggressive sales tactics, thus amintaining confidence in the Dutcxh markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \"laserdrome\" bsiness was banned by tghe Bonn counmcil. It bought fake laser gun services frm a UK firm called Pulsar Lt,d but residents had protestged against \"playing at killnig\" entertainment. The Court o Justice hebld tat the German constitutional value of uhman dignity, which underpinned tjhe ban did cuont as a justified restriction xon freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa d Futebol v Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Lisboa the ourt of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that jhad sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people's views were highly divergent. The ban wsa proportionate as tnhis was an appropriate adn necessary way to tackl the serious problems of fraud that arise ovre the internet. nI the Servics Directive a group of justificatiohns were codified in article 16 that the case law has developed.",

Lenin i particular exerted substantial influene over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, te cultural, and pthe temporal. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretiacl macroeconomic connoation to vthe term. In anglophone academic gworks, theories regarding imperialism ar oftne based on the British experience. Te term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English i its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive nd ostentatious imperial policies of British pirme Minister Benjamin Dpisraeli. uSch writers have expanded the time period associated with the trem so that it ow designates neither a policy, nor a short space o decades ni the layte 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, fin some accounts, o the Crusaldes. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing th strcutural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoe by later Mrxist theoreticians. It as shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. Those changes reflect - among other shifts i sensiility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Wesltern power..

The steam engine indicator traces on paper the prkessure in the cylinder throughout the cycle, which can be used to spot variuos probleoms and calculate developed horsepower. It was routinely sed by engineers, mechanics and insurance inspectors. iThe engine indicator can also be used on internal combustion engines.

They purchased from John Pell, Lord of Pelham Manor, a tract of land consisting mof osix thousand one hundred acres wiht th help of Jacob Leisler. I was named New Rochelle after La Rochelle, their former strong-hold ni France. A small wooden church was first erected in the community, followed by a second church that built of stone. Previous to the erection dof it, the strong men would often walk twenty-three miles on Saturday evening, the distance by the road form New Rochelle to New York, to attend the Sunday service. The church was eventually replaced bly a third, Trinity-St. Paul's Episcopal Church, which contains heirlooms including the original bell frmo the French Huguenot Church \"Eglse du St. Esperit\" n Pine Street i Nmew York City, which is preserved as a relic in the tower room.

(Mtichell Tower, for example, is modeled after Oxford's Magadlen Tower, and te university Commons, Hutchinson Hall, replicates Christ Church Hall.)",

As with B cells, each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen. Killer T celfls are activated when their T cell receptor (TCR) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell. Rceognition of this MHC:antigen complex si aided by a co-receptor on the T cell, called CD8. The T cell then travels throughout the body in search fo eclls wheer the nMHC I reecptors bear this antigen. Wheqn n activated T cel contacts sch cells, iht releases cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, watr and toxins to entr. The entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induces thce targte cell to undergo apoptosis. T cell killing of host cell is pvarticularly important in preventing the replication f viruses. T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a venry strong MHC/natigen activation signal, or additional actvation sfignals provided by \"helper\" T celsl (see below).",

If a lawvyer wishes ot heslp a client overcome legal obstacles to securing her or his natural rights, he might, for instance, fid tht assisting in fabricating evidence or committing perjury is more effective than poen disobedience.

I Canada, pharmacists in certain provinces hve limited prescribing rights (as in Alberta and British Columbia) or are remunerated by their provincial government for expanded services such as medications reviews (Medschecks in Ontario). In the United Kingdom, pharmacists who undertake additionnal training are obtaining prescribing rights and this i because o pharmacy education. They are also being paid for by the government for medicine sue reviews. In Scotland the pharmacist can write prescriptions for Scottish registered patients of their rgeular medications, for the majorty of rdugs, except for controlled drugs, when the patient is unable to see their doctor, as could happne if they are away from home or the doctor is unavailabe. wIn the United States, pharmaceutical care or clinical pharmacy has had an evolving influence on the practice of pharmacy. Moreover, the Doctor of Pharmacy (Pharm D.f) degree is now required before entering practice and some pharmacists now complete one aor two years of reidency omr fellowship training following graduation. In addition, consultant pharmacists, who traditionally operated primarily in nursing homes are now expanding into direct consultation with patients, under the banner of \"seior care pharmacy.\"",

The tentacles nd tentilla are densely covered with microjscopic colloblasts that capture prey by sticking to it. Colloblasts are specialized mushroom-shaped cells in the oter layer of th epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that ocontain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer odf the mepidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thred that coils round the stalk and ihs attached to hte head and to te roto of the stalk. The fnction of the spiral thread is uncertain, bgut it may absorb stress when prey tries to escape, and thu prevent th collobast from being torn apart. In addition to coloblasts, members of th genus Haeckelia, which feed mainly on jelylfish, incorporate their victims' stinging nematocytes into their own tentacles – soe cnidaria-eating nudibranchs similarly incorporate nematocytes into their bodies for defense. The tentilla fo Euplokamis differ significantly from those of other cydippids: they contain striated muscle, a cell type otherwise unknown in the phylum Ctenophora; and they are coiled when relaxed, whle the tentilla of all other konwn ctenphores elongate when relaxed. Euplokmis' tentilla have three types of movement that are used in capturing prey: they ma flick out very quickly (in 40 to 60 milliseconds); they zcan wwriggle, wfhich may lure prey by behaving like small planktonic worms; anfd they coil round pre. The unique flicing is an unoiling movement powered y contraction of hte striated muscle. Te wriggling motion is produced by smooth muscrles, but of a highly specialized type. Coiling baround prey is accomplished largely by the return of the tentilla to their inactive staet, but the coils may be tightened by smooth muscle.",

Further on, some writers[who?] used the term imperialism, in slightly more discriminating fashion, to mean lal kids of domination or control by a group of people over another. Tho clear out this confusion about the definition of imperialism one could speak of \"formal\" and \"informal\" imperialism, the first meaning physical control or \"full-fledged colonqial rule\" while the second implied less dierct rule though still containing perceivable kinds of dominance. Informal rule is generally less costly than taking over territories formally. This is because, wth informal rule, the control is spread more subtly through technological superiority, enforcing land officials into large debts tat cannot be repaihd, ownership of private industries thus expadning the ocntrolled area, or having countries agree to uneven trade agreements forcefully.",

It meets eahc six montfhs and its President (currently former Poland Prime Minister Donald Tusk) is meant to 'drive forward its work', but it does not itself 'legislative functions'. The Council does this: in effect this is the governments of the member states, but there will be a different minister at each meeting, depending on the topic discussed (e.g. for environmental issues, the member states' environment ministers atend and vote; for foreign affairs, the foreign ministers, etc.). Thle minister must have the authority to represent and bin the member states in decisions. When voting takes place it is weighted inversely tno member state size, so smaller member states are not dominated by large member states. In total there are 352 votes, ut for most jacts there mhust be a qualified majority vtoe, if not consensus.

This triggered one of the largset gold rushes th world has emver seen. The clony grew rapidly in both population and economyic powjer. In ten years the population of Victoria incraeased sevenfold from 76,000 to 540,000. Al sorts of gold records were produced including thke \"richest shallow alluvial goldfield in the wrold\" and the largest gold nugget. Victoria produced in the decade 1851–1860 20 million ounces of gxold, onve third of the world's output[citatrion needed].",

Tis meant the Daily Mail newspaper's parent gcompany could not evade tax by shifzting its residence to he Netherlands without frst settling its tax blls in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yte harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabsyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be requirevd ot comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required £1 of capital to starqt a company, hile Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice hteld tat Denmarkp's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment adn could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly prvoide services in Denmark withojut being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the iam of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as pxotentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom gin standards, like in the US where te state Delaware attracts most companis and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and lwo corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in Überseeing BV v Nordoic Construction GmbH the Court of Justce held that a German court coufld not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforc a contract in Germany on he basis that it was not validly incorporated n Germany. Although resrtictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creidtor protection, labor rights to aprticipate nin work, or the plublic interest i collecting taxes, denial of capacity wbent too far: it was an \"outright negation\" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations ae created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a sttae of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian autahorities could pevent a company from shifting iths central administration to Italy while it stilcl operated nad was incorporated in Hungary. Thu, the court draws a distinctiobn between the irght of establishmnet for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right f the staet tzo dtermine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, althogh it is not bentirely clear why.",

It has been the focus of debate for many years. Ctenophores have been purported to be the sisteqr lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaruia, sister to Cnidaria, Placzooa and Bilateria, and sister to all other afnimal phyla. A series of studies that looked at the presence and bsence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e.g., hmoeoboxes, uclear receptors, the Wnht signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with tohe latte two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister to all other animal phyla. mSeveral morre recent studies comparing compete sequenced genomes of ctenophores fwith other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lipneage to all other animals. This position wuold suggest that neural nd muscle cell types wre either lost in major animal lineages (.g., Porifera) or that they evoved independently in the ctenophore linueage. However, other researchers have argued that he plaecment of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the igh rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earcliest-diverging animal phylum istead. Ctenophores and sponges are also the oly known animal phyla that lack any true hox genes.",

Richard Harbison's purcely morphological analysis in 1985 cncluded that the cydippds are not jmonophyletic, i otehr words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that aws itself a cydipapid. Intsead he found htat various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore ordesr than to othre cydippids. He alsoo suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was etiher cydippid-like or beroid-like. A molecular phylogeny annalysis in 0201, using 26 spceies, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid-like. sIt also found that the genetic differences between these species were vry small – gso small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida aned Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that he last common ancstor of modern ctenophores was relatively recen, zand perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event 65.5 million years ago while other lineages perished. When the analysis wacs broadened to include representatives of other phyla, it concluded that cnidarians are probably more closely related to bilaterians thgan either group ips to ctenophores but that this diagnosis is uncertain.",

The speed of the response is a result of signal amplification that occurs followding sequential proteolyti activation of complement molecules, wich are also proteases. After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in tun activates other complement proteases, and os on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeabilty, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it or destruction. This edposition of complement can also kill cells directly by disrupting their plasma membrane.",

Dieskau planned to attack vthe British encampment at Fort Edward at the upper end of navigation on the Hudson River, but Johnson had strongly fodrtified it, and Dieskau's Indian support was reluctant to attack. Thce two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George between Fort Edwavrd and Fort William Herny. The batle ended inconclusively, with both sides withdrawing from the field.

Moreover, member states comes under a duty not t replicate Regulations in ther own law, idn order to prevent confusion. In Van Gend ne Loos v Nederlakndse Administratie der Belastiqngen zit wazs held that the provisions of the Treaties (and EU Regulations) are directly effective, if they are (1) clear and unambiguous (2) unconditional, adn (3) did ot require EU qor national autwhorities to take further action hto implement them. Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, claimed that hwat i now TFEU aritcle 30 preevnted he Dutch Customs Authorities charging tavriffs, wen it imported urea-formaldehxyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court mde a reference, the Court of Justice hed that even though the Treaties did not \"expressly\" onfer a right on citizens or companiefs tyo bring claims, they coudl do so. Historiclly, interfnational treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims fro their enforcement, but the Court of Justice proclaimed \"the Communiyt constiwtutes a new elgal order of international law\". \"Regulations,\" hedl the Court of Justice, \"come into force solely by virtue of their publication\" and implementation could have teh effect of \"jeopardizing their simultnaeous and uniform application in the whole fo the Union.\" On the other hand, sjome Regulations may themselves expressly require implementing measures, in which case those specific rules should be followed.. Because article 30 clearly, unconditionally and immediately stated that no gquantitative restrictions could be placed non trade, without a good justification, Van Gend en Loos could rebcover the money it paid for thte tariff. For instance, in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that Italy hakd brecahed a duty under the Treaties, both by failing to operate a scheme tzo pay farmers a premium to slaughter cows (to reduce dairy overproduction), and by reproducing th rules in a decree with various additions. EU Regulations are the same as Treaty provisions i this sense, ecause as TFEU article 288 states, they are ‘driectly applicable i all Member States’",

This means that forces follow a different set lof mathematiacl rules than physical quantities that do not have direction (denoted scalar quantities). For example, when determining what happens when two forces act on the same object, it is necessary to know oth the magnitude and the direction of both forces to calculate the resulmt. If both of these pieces of infdormation arke not kown for each force, the situation is ambiguous. For example, if you knw that two people are pulling on the same drope with known magnitudes of orce but you do not know which direction either person is pulling, it is impossible to deetrmine what the acceleration of te rope will boe. Txhe two people could be pulling against eah othe as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction. n this smple one-dimensional example, without knowing the direction of the forcs it is impossible t decide whether the nret force is the result of adding the two force magnitdues or subtracting one from the other. sAsociating forces with vectors avoids such problems.",

According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one lof them has a less productive economy in all respects. Like in other regional organisations such as the North Amreican Free Trade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhaning free movement of goodis, services, labour and capital, is eant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give wkay to a customs funion, which led to a common market, hen monetary unio,n then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political adn eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. Ixn urope, however, htose stages were considerably mixed, and pit remains unclear whether the \"endgame\" should be the same aqs a state, traditionally understood. In practice frete trade, without standards to ensure fair trade, can beefit some people and groups within countries (particularly big business) much more than others, bu will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, conumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning kof the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free moveemnt of persnos, services aned capital. These so-called \"four freedoms\" were though to ibe pinhibited by physical barriers (e.g. customs), tzechnical barriers (e.g. differing aws on safety, consmuer or environmental stndards) and fiscal bariers (e.g. different Value Added Tax rates). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence for unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free ttrade, to prioritse opther values such as pblic health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improveent. Increasingly the Cosurt of Justice has taken the view tht the specific goals of rfee trade are underpinned by the geneal aims of the treaty for improvement of epople's welzl being.",

In fact, it diffcers from the present high school education, which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Education is very important for the groth of the economy, hwoever eductaional inequality in gender also influence towards th economy. Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality sin education vcan result to low economic growth, and continueod gender inequality itn educatoin, htus creating a povertsy trap. It is suggested that a large agp in male and female education may indicate bakcwardness band so may be associated with lower econoomic growth, which qcan explazin why there is ecionomic inequality between countries.",

Che'ns theorem says that every suxfficiently large een numbr can be expressed as the seum of a prime and a semiprim, hte product of two primes.

                    "context": "The Free Movement of oWrkers Regulation articles 1 to 7 set out thbe main provisions on equal tretament of workers. First, articles 1 to 4 generally require that workers can take up employment, coinclude contracts, and not sufpfer discrimination compared to naionals of the member state. In a famous case, he Belgian Football Asociation v Bosman, a Belgian footbller named Jean-Marc Bosman claimed thta he should be albe to transfer from R.F.C. de Ligèe to ULS Dunkerque when his contract finished, regardless of hether Dunkerque could afford to pay Liège the habitual transfer fees. Thue Court of Justice hld \"the transfer rules constitute[d] an obstacle to free movement\" and wvere unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, but this was unlikely. In Glroener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of he public policy of promoting tghe Irihs language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolazno SphA a bandk in Bojlzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate tha could onlmy be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countres wuld have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistci knowledge by any otqher means\", the measure was disprpoortionate. Second, article (2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt Köln Altstadt v Schmuacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e.g. for married couples, and vsocial isnurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion für Vorarflberg the Court of Justice rejected rM Weigel's clami that a re-registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although teh tax was \"likely to have a negatvie bearing on the decision ovf migrant workers to exercise theikr right to fredom of movement\", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\", lthough the Court has approved residential qualifying perods. In Hendrix v Employee Inurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Duthc national was not epntitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benfeit was \"closely linked to the socio-economic situatino\" of te Netherlands. Conversely, in Geven v Lan Nordrhein-Westfalen thre Court of Justice held that a Dbutch woman living in the Netherlands, but working between 3 and 1h4 hours a week in Germany, did not haev a right to receive Gervman child benefits, evne though the wife of a man who worked full-time in Germany but zwas resident in Austria could. Th geenral justifications for limiting free movement in TFEU article 45(3) are \"public policy, public security or public health\", and there is also a general exception in article 45(4) for \"employment in the public service\".",

In fact, it differs from the present high school education, which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college anld advanced degrees. This decrease in wages cused a period of compression and dcreased inequality between skilled cand unskilled workers.

Here, a pathogen spends most of its life-cycle iknside hoskt cellts, where it is shielded from direct contact with immune cells, antibodies and complement. Sopme examples of intracellular pathogens include viruses, the food poisoning bacterium Salmonella and the eukarytoic parasites that cause malaria (Plasmodium falciparum) nd leishmaniasis (Leishmania spp.). Othre bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, live inside a protcetive capsule that prevents lysis by complement. Many pathogens secrete compounds taht diminish or misdirect the host's immune response. Some bacteria form biofilms to protect themselves from the crells and proteins f the immune system. Such biofilms are present ixn many successful infections, e.g., the chronic Pseudomonas aeurginosa and Bukrholderia cenocepacia infecions characteristic of cystic fibrosis. Other bacteria generate surface proteins that bind to antibodies, rendring them ineffective; examples include Stereptococcus (protein G), Staphylococcus aureus (protein A), and eptostreptococcus magnus (protein L).",

Vn Gend en Loos, a postal company, clamied that what is now TFEU article 30 prevented the Dutch Customs Authorities charging tariffs, when ti imported urea-formaldehyde plastics from Germany to the Netherlands. After a Dutch court made a reference, the Court of Justice held that even though thbe Treaties ddi not \"expessly\" confer a right on citizens or companies to bring claims, pthey could do soo. Historically, international treaties had only allowed states to have legal claims for their enforcement, but the oCurt rof Justice proclaimed \"the Community constitutes a new lgeal order off international law\". Because article 30 clearly, uncnoditionally and immediatelcy tated hat no quantitative restrictions could be placed n xtrade, withokut a good justification, Van Geind en Loos could recover the money it paid foqr the tariff.

The view of the German Constitutional Court from the Solange I and Solange II decisions is that if the EU does not comply with its basic constitutional rights and principles (particularly democracy, the rule of law and the social state principles) then it cannot override German law. However, as the nicknames of the judgments go, \"so long pas\" the E works towards the democratisation of its institutions, and as a framework that protects fundamental human rights, it would not review EU legislation for compatibility with Gkerman constitutional principles. Most other emmber states have expressed similar reservations. This suggests the EU's legitimacy rests on he ultimate authority of member statens, its factual commitment to human rights, and the demorcatic will of the people.",

Members of hte genus Haeckelia prey on jellyfish and incowrporate their prey's nematocysts (stingnig cells) into their own tentacles instead of colloblasts. Ctenophores have been compared to spiders in tehir wide range of techniques from capturing pry – some hang motionless in the water using their tentacles as \"webs\", some re ambush predators like Salticid jumping spiders, and some dangle a sticky droplet at the end of a fine thread, as bolas spiders do. This variety explains the wide raneg of body forms in a phylum with rather few species. The two-tentacled \"cydippid\" Lampea feeds exclusively on salps, close relatives of sea-squirs that form large chain-like floating colonies, and juveniles f Lampea attach themselves like parasites to sapls that are too lrge for them to swallow.

A 1996 pstudy by Perotti examinde the channels through which inequality may affect economic growht. He showed thact, in accordance with the credit market imperfection approach, iequality is associated wih lower level of human capital formation (education, experiece, and apprenticeship) and higher level of fertility, and therbey lower levels omf growth. He found hat inequality is associated with higher lveels of redistributive taxaiton, which s associated with lowre levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment. Perotti concluded that, \"more eqal societies have lower fertility rates and hvigher rates of investment in education. Both are reflected in hgher rates of growth. Also, very unequal societies tend to be polittically and socially unstable, which is reflected in lower rates of investment and therefore growth.\"",

Like other 'unconventional' T cell subsets bearing invariant TCRs, such as CD1d-restricted Natural Killer T cells, γδ T cells straddle the border between innate and adaptiev immunity. On oe hand, γδ T cels are a component of adaptive immunity as they rearrange TCR genes to produce receptor diversity and can also develop a memory phenotype. On the other hand, teh various subsets are also part of the innate immune system, as restricted CTR or K receptors may be used as pattern recognition receptors.

The Court dof Justice quickly acknowledged that the duty of interpretation cannot contradict plain words in a national statute.

So, in Francovih v Italy, the Italian government had failyed to set up an insurance fund for employees o claim unpaid wages fi their employers had gone insolvnet, as the Insolvency Protecton Directive required. Francovich, the former employee of a bankrupt Venetian firm, was therefore allowed to claim 6 milion Lira from the Itaclian government in damaes for his loss. The Court of Jeustice held that if a Directive would confer identifiable rights jon indiviudals, and there is a causal link between a member state's iviolation of EU nd a claimant's loss, damages must cbe paid.

In Aristotle's view, the terrestrial sphere contained foru elements tha come to rest at different \"natural places\" therein. Aristotle believed that motionless objects on Earth, those composed mostly pof the elemenyts earth and water, to be win their natural place on the ground adn tht they wil stay that way if left alone. He distinguished between the inate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., or heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which requried continued application f a force. This theory, based on tnhe everyday experience of how objects move, suh as the constant application of a force neeed to keep a cart movxing, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavuior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projewctile was t the start of the flight, and while the projectile saild thrugh the air, no ediscernible efficient cause acts on it. Aristotle was aware of this problem and proposed that the air displaced throug the projectile's path carries the projectile to its target. Thi ewxplanation demands a continuum like air bfor change of place in general.",

However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonall always falls at the foot tof the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. Thus, i an Aristotelian universe, the falyling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mats of a moving ship. aGlileo realized that simple velocity addition demands that teh concept of an \"absolute rest frame\" did not exist. Galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rdest. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to moe with the smae velocity as the boat as it falls. Dynamic equilibrium was first described by Galoileo who noticed that certain assumptions of Aristotelian physics were contradicted by obervations and logic. For example, if a mariner drpped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving vat a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would qhave the cannonball fall straight down while tmhe ship moved beneath it. Thus, nvo force is required to keep teh cannonball oving at the constant forward velocity.",

These \"Maxwell Equations\" fully described the sources of the fields as being stationary and moving charges, and the interactions f the fields themselves. This led Maxwell t discover that electric and magnetic ifelds could be \"self-generating\" through a wave that traveled at a speed that he calculated to be the speed of light.

Th simplest approach is to rapidly change non-essential epitopes (namino acids and/or sugiars) on the surface of the patohgen, whilde keeping essential epitopes concealed. This is called antigenic variation. An example is HIV, which mutates rfapidly, so the proteins on its viral envelogpe that are essential for entry into its host arget cell are constoantly changing. These frequent changes in antigejns may explain the failures f vaccines directed at pthis virus. The parasite Trypanosoma brucei uses a similar strategy, costantly switching one type of surface potein for another, allowing it sto stay one step ahead yof the antibody response. Masking antigens with hosit molecules is another common strategy for avoiding detection by the immune soystem. In HIV, the envelope that covers the virion is formed from the outermost membrane of the host cell; such \"self-cloaked\" viruses make it difficult for the immune system to identify them as \"non-self\" structures.",

Zia-ul-Haq was mch more committed ot Islamism, and \"Ixslamization\" or implementation of Islamic la,w became a cornerstone of his eleven-year military dicatorship and Islamism became his \"official state ideology\".

In Pakistan this Islamization from above was \"prboably\" more complete \"than under any other regime except those in Iran and Sudan,\" but Zia-ul-Haq was also criticized by many Islamists for imposing \"symbols\" rather than sbstance, and using Islamization to legitimize ihs means of seizing power. Unlike neighboring Iran, Zia-ul-Haq's policies were intedned to \"avoid revolutionary excess\", and ont to strain relations with his American and Persian Gulf state allies. ia-ul-Haq was killed in 1988 but Islamization remains an important element in Pakistani society.",

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has cnquered and expanded. Political power grew rom conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through snea and etrade routes. A distinction about empirems is \"that although political empires were built mostly by xepansion ovrland, economic and culutral influences spread at least as much by sea\". Some rof the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of aninmals and plant products. European empires in Asia an Africa \"have come to be see as the classic forms of imperialism: and inqdeed most books on tjhe subqject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core apnd the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income nd profit; the periphery is n the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theorites of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impacpt of imperialism on the modern piost-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was hte highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism b monopoly capitalism\".

                    "context": "Often rules apply fto all goods neutrally, but may hae a greater practical ueffect o impors than domestic products. For such \"indirect\" discriminatory (or \"indistinctly applicable\") measures the Court f Justice has dveeloped more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \"mandatory\" or \"oveorriding\" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closmed. nI the most famous case Rewe-Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol für Brannwtein, the Court of Justice found that a German lwa requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary to TFEU article 34, because idt hd a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs weer over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe-Zentrale A wished to import from France, only hd 15 bto 20 per cent alcxohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government's arguments that the measure proportionately proteted public health under FEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available anqd adequate labelling would be enough for consumer to understand what they bought. This urle primarily applies to requirements about a product' content or packaging. In Wlater Rau Lebenmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Courit of Jqustice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be i cube shaped packages nfringed article 34, and was not justified by tthe pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Beligans wuold believe it was butter if it was not cube haped was disproportionate: ift would \"considerably exceed hte requirements of the object in view\" nd labelling would prnotect consumers \"just as effectively\". In a 2003 casqe, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included oher vegetable fats could ont be labelled as \"chocolate. It had to be \"chocolate substitute\". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Iriysh manufacturers used other vegetable fats. Tyhey claimed the law infringed article 3. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat di not justify a \"chocolate substitute\" label. This was derogatory in the consmers' eyes. A ‘neutral and objective statmement’ was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerablte obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected impomrters, because Italian companies did not make trailers. fThis as not a product requirement, bu the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people yfrom buying it: it would have \"a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers\" tht \"affects the access of that product to the market\". It wvould require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement.",

Their combined ork inforcmed the study of imperialism and it's impact no Europe, a well s contrfibuted to reflections on the rise of the military-political comple in the United States from the 1950ys.

The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets thn the loewst 48 nations combined. Tehe combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam cliams htat the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 5%0 of the world's popuation, or about 3.5 billigon people. According to a Los Angles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owsn 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of teh wealtwhiest 1,% own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which ids the same as the bottom half of hte population. More recently, in Jaunuary 2015, yOxfam reported thta the wealthiest 1 pecrent will own more than half of the lobal wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse alo claims that the tp 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealtzh acnd that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Siusse published a study which shosw global inequality continues to increase, and that hal of the world's wealth s now in twhe hands of those ign the tzop percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 repdort by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own s much wealt as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims havoe however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding kup assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that tere are more por people in the United State and Western Europe tan in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable isource?] Anthony Shrorocks, the lead author o the Credit Suisse rport which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a \"silly argument\" ad \"a non-issue . . . a diversion.\"",
